        "The field of regenerative medicine holds great promise for restoring structure and function to damaged, diseased, or degenerated cells, tissues, and organs (Berthiaume et al., 2011; Sun & Kurtzberg, 2015). Osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease of the joints, is caused by mechanical stress, ligamentous injury, and genetic factors affecting cartilage and bone. It leads to pain, inflammation, and impaired of joint function (Hunter, 2011). In the context of regenerative medicine, an ideal approach to treating osteoarthritis would involve stimulating chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells and the formation of new cartilage tissue. Although various methods have been proposed to promote cartilage regeneration and prevent the progression of osteoarthritis, including the use of growth factors and biomaterials, there is still no highly effective pharmacological treatment available (Wu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019). Growth factors, particularly transforming growth factors are commonly employed for cartilage regeneration. However, due to their instability and short half-lives, achieving long-term induction has proven challenging (Lo et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016). To solve this, Johnson et al. utilized an image-based, high-throughput screening approach to evaluate over 22,000 structurally diverse, heterocyclic, drug-like molecules that mimic natural ligands involved in cell signaling and differentiation. Among these molecules, they identified kartogenin, one small molecule that demonstrated a dose-dependent promotion of chondrocyte differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells (Johnson et al., 2012; Marini & Forlino, 2012). Furthermore, kartogenin’s in vivo efficacy was assessed in two murine osteoarthritis models, both of which showed the formation of new articular cartilage, reduced serum levels of cartilage breakdown products, and improved load-bearing capacity. As a result, kartogenin has emerged as a small, functionally active molecule with regenerative and protective effect on cartilage tissue, and is now being investigated in the field of regenerative medicine.",
        "Since its initial discovery and subsequent characterization, kartogenin has undergone extensive investigation for various applications, particularly in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. These applications encompass a range of anatomical sites, including cartilage, nucleus pulposus, meniscus, trachea, skin, and entheses (Figure 1) (Yin et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017; Im, 2018; Cai, Liu et al., 2019; Cai, Zhang et al., 2019). However, the physical and chemical properties of kartogenin, such as its hydrophobicity and low bioavailability, often hinder its standalone effectiveness. Therefore, a more prudent approach involves combining kartogenin with biomaterials, which holds promise for guiding tissue regeneration (Makris et al., 2015; Stejskalová & Almquist, 2017; Armiento et al., 2018). Notably, the structure and properties of kartogenin, particularly its carboxyl groups and hydrophobicity nature, make it amenable to incorporation into a diverse range of biomaterials. Introducing small, functional molecules into scaffolds represents an economical and effective strategy for developing bioactive materials for tissue engineering (Lu & Atala, 2014; Sun et al., 2019; Xuan et al., 2020). Moreover, the combination of kartogenin with other materials can yield synergistic effects. Overcoming limitations in the drug’s physical and chemical properties, thereby enhancing its bioavailability and reducing side effects. Simultaneously, it can augment the biological activity and functionality of scaffolds intended for tissue regeneration.",
        "Schematic diagram of kartogenin-Combinative biomaterials, including nanoparticles, nanofibers, porous scaffold, hydrogels etc. and their potential applications in regenerative medicine such as cartilage, meniscus, skin, entheses.",
        "Since its initial report in 2012, there have been over 150 related studies related to kartogenin. However, existing reviews of kartogenin are limited in scope and fail to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field. In this review, we extensively discuss the physicochemical properties and biological function of kartogenin. Additionally, we provide an in-depth examination of state-of-the-art functionalized biomaterials, with a particular focus on their design, structure, function, and application. Furthermore, we address the necessary properties for further translational applications in diverse biomaterials. Finally, we outline potential research directions for the utilization of kartogenin and similar bioactive molecules, elucidating their prospects in the realms of biomaterials and regenerative medicine.",
        "Since its discovery, numerous studies have extensively investigated the properties and underlying biological mechanisms of kartogenin (Figure 2). In this section, we provide a comprehensive overview of its fundamental physicochemical properties and biological functions.",
        "The structure and function of kartogenin. A) Schematic diagram of synthesis and decomposition of kartogenin. kartogenin can be synthesized through the chemical reaction of 4-aminobiphenyl and phthalic anhydride, and hydrolyzed into 4-aminobiphenyl and phthalic acid. B) Signaling pathways and cell receptors of kartogenin involved in regenerative medicine. Each arrow indicates a specific signaling pathway or tissue engineering.",
        "Kartogenin is a small, heterocyclic molecule (Figure 2A) with a molecular weight of 317.3 g/mol. Structurally, it consists of 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) and phthalic acid (PA) linked by an amide bond. Additionally, kartogenin exhibits hydrophobic characteristics, making it readily soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide while remaining insoluble in water. Moreover, it demonstrates stable storage properties at room temperature. Synthesis of kartogenin involves the utilization of phthalic anhydride and 1,1′-biphenyl-4-amine (Johnson et al., 2012), which can be prepared through the combination of phenylboronic acid with 4-iodoaniline or 4-bromoaniline (Shi et al., 2016; Massaro et al., 2019). Various analytical methods that can be employed to confirm or detect kartogenin based on its structure (Hu et al., 2017), such as hydrogen/carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (1H/13C NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) (see Table 1). Conversely, kartogenin can undergo hydrolysis by amide bond-breaking substances like amidases and peptidases, liberating its hydrolysates 4-ABP and PA, with 4-ABP playing a pivotal role in chondrogenic differentiation (Zhang et al., 2019).",
        "The common detection methods and characteristics of kartogenin.",
        "Furthermore, kartogenin possesses two hydrogen bond donor sites and three hydrogen bond acceptor groups. This property allows effective but reversible attachment to the matrix structure through hydrogen bonding when polysaccharides are employed in scaffold production. Consequently, costly or cumbersome binding strategies are not required (Kang et al., 2014, 2016; Westin et al., 2017). Additionally, its carboxyl group enables chemically crosslinking with other materials through covalent bonding, such as amidation or esterification with amine and hydroxyl groups, respectively. These physical and chemical properties facilitate the application of kartogenin in biomaterial engineering, utilizing either physical encapsulation or chemical conjugation methods.",
        "Initially, Johnson and colleagues discovered that kartogenin induces chondrogenesis by binding to the carboxyl end of the actin-binding protein, filamin A, which disrupts its interaction with the transcription factor ‘core-binding factor β’ (CBFβ) subunit (Johnson et al., 2012). This interaction frees CBFβ to enter the nucleus and form a transcriptional complex with runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), facilitating cartilage differentiation (Figure 2B). Subsequent research has identified additional cell signaling pathways and receptors involved in kartogenin-induced chondrogenic differentiation. Zhou et al. demonstrated that kartogenin activates the BMP-7/Smad5 pathway, inducing differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chondrocytes (Zhou et al., 2019). Liu et al. suggested that KGN promotes cartilage regeneration by stimulating differentiation of cartilage stem/progenitor cells and enhancing proliferation via the IL-6/Stat3 signaling pathway (Liu et al., 2020). Fan et al. revealed that kartogenin attenuates the degradation of RUNX1, which physically interacts with p-Smad3 in the nucleus (Fan et al., 2020). Jing et al. discovered that kartogenin directs human umbilical cord MSCs (hUCMSCs) toward a precartilaginous stage by enhancing JNK phosphorylation and suppression of β-catenin (Jing et al., 2019). Furthermore, they found that small extracellular vesicles (sEvs) derived from kartogenin-preconditioned hUCMSCs are rich in miR-381-3p, which directly suppresses TAOK1 and inhibits the Hippo signaling pathway, thereby promoting chondrogenesis (Jing et al., 2020). A study by Zhang et al. suggested that 4-ABP targets the RPS6KA2 and PI3K–Akt pathways, with PI3K–Akt activation promoting osteoarthritic repair (Zhang et al., 2019).",
        "Apart from its effects on cartilage, kartogenin also influences other tissues. It enhances lubricin accumulation through the c-Myc and adamts5 pathways (Liu et al., 2015), thereby slowing the degeneration of intervertebral disks (Huang et al., 2018) and reducing pain (Kwon et al., 2018). Wang and colleagues found that kartogenin could promotes type I collagen synthesis through activating Smad4/Smad5 of the TGF-β signaling pathway, suggesting its potential applications in wound healing (Wang et al., 2014). It has also been found to regulate hair follicles growth and hair growth cycle transition by inhibiting TGF-β2/Smad signaling (Chen et al., 2022). Additionally, kartogenin stimulates limb development through various key signaling pathways, particularly TGF-β (Decker et al., 2014) and inhibits the ossification process by suppressing the β-catenin/RUNX2 pathway (Jing et al., 2019). Furthermore, kartogenin has been utilized for fibrocartilage repair, particularly in the context of tendon-to-bone repair (Zhou et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021).",
        "Kartogenin exhibits good cytocompatibility and significantly enhances the proliferation of MSCs in a concentration-dependent manner (Zhang & Wang, 2014; Spakova et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). However, its effects on different cells vary, with 10 μM concentration yielding optimal effect on MSCs and 100 μM concentration promoting the proliferation tendon stem cells (TSCs) most effectively (Huang et al., 2017). Kartogenin can be administered directly through injection or oral. While most studies have focused on injection, one study has detected its distribution and decomposition products in vivo following oral administration (Zhang et al., 2019). The results showed the presence of kartogenin in the blood, while 4-ABP was detected in the cartilage, indicating bioabsorption through the oral route. However, despite the advantages of in situ injection in attenuating or avoiding liver metabolism and associated side effects, the limitations of low retention, short duration, the need for multiple injections and low bioavailability remain significant drawbacks. .",
        "To date, extensive research has been conducted to investigate the receptors and signaling pathways affected by kartogenin at the cellular and molecular level. Its biological application, particularly in the manipulation and therapy of endogenous cells, have garnered widespread recognition. Efforts to minimize side effects and maximize its biological function, guided by an understanding of its physicochemical properties, have led to successful utilization of kartogenin in the field of material science, demonstrating its immense potential in regenerative medicine (Table 2). Thoughtful studies have also yielded good results in tissue engineering, which will be discussed in the following sections.",
        "Summary of reported kartogenin delivery systems in regenerative medicine.",
        "Nanodelivery, as a cutting-edge controlled drug delivery approach, offers the advantages of biodegradability, biocompatibility, and non-toxicity. It allows for the design of systems that achieve precise release kinetics, regulate biodistribution, and minimize toxic side effects, thereby improving the therapeutic index of the administered drug (Jiang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019). In this section, we provide a comprehensive review and discussion of nanomaterials in the context of kartogenin, with a specific emphasis on nanoparticles, nanofibers, and extracellular vesicles.",
        "Nanoparticles, with their diverse forms and wide range of functions, have found extensive applications in various areas such as bioimaging, anti-microbial and antitumor targeting, and gene and drug delivery (Zhu et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2018; Song et al., 2021). These particles offer the ability to protect bioactive agents, control their release profiles, minimize side effects, and efficiently deliver them to target cells, maximizing their therapeutic effects. Notably, nanoparticles can be precisely synthesized in terms of shape, size and surface morphology to enhance solubility, immunocompatibility, and cellular uptake (Goldberg et al., 2007; Somiya & Kuroda, 2015). Furthermore, encapsulating active molecules within nanoparticles provides protection against degradation in biological fluids, enhaces solubility, and enables sustained and controlled release over time and space (Martinez et al., 2015; Parodi et al., 2017).",
        "Chitosan, a chitin derivative with polycationic characteristics and the presence of an amino group, can be conjugated to kartogenin via the catalytic synthesis of amide bonds, using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide in combination with N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). It is then fabricated into nanoparticles using an ionic gelation method, using the tripolyphosphate anion which interacts with cationic chitosan via electrostatic forces (Zhang et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2014). Im’s group demonstrated that these kartogenin-conjugated chitosan nanoparticles improve the aqueous solubility and biocompatibility of hydrophobic kartogenin, exhibiting sustained in vitro release for up to 7 weeks. These polymer-drug conjugates hold promise as a drug delivery system for osteoarthritis treatment (Kang et al., 2014). They also developed thermo-responsive polymeric nanoparticles based on chitosan (Figure 3A) in which kartogenin was covalently cross-linked to the outer part of a dual drug-release nanoparticle, with independent control of release achieved through temperature change (Kang et al., 2016).",

        "Polymeric nanoparticles with hydrophobic regions have the advantage of encapsulating hydrophobic molecules, offering good dispersion and high drug loading capacity, making them suitable for nano-delivery systems. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), a synthetic polypeptide known for its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and nonimmunogenicity, has been extensively employed in drug delivery applications (Zhang et al., 2022). As a hydrophobic molecule, kartogenin can be easily loaded into PLGA carriers to enhance its solubility and stability. Pariya and colleagues encapsulated kartogenin in PLGA nanoparticles using an emulsion-based formulation method (Figure 3B) and encapsulated the loaded nanoparticles into a composite scaffold, achieving linear and sustained release of kartogenin for up to 30 days with reduced initial burst release (Zare et al., 2021). Similarly, Asgari and colleagues developed KGN-loaded PLGA nanoparticles using an emulsion/solvent evaporation method, achieving an encapsulation efficiency of 70%.The release of kartogenin from PLGA nanoparticles lasted for 32 days with an initial burst release on the first day (Asgari et al., 2020).",
        "In addition to polymeric nanoparticles, certain ions or metal nanoparticles can be employed for imaging purposes. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), composed of host lattices of ceramic materials, can absorb near-infrared light and convert it to weak UV or visible light, making them effective tools for light-mediated drug delivery in biomedical applications (Haase & Schäfer, 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2014). Li and colleagues developed multifunctional nanoparticles based on UCNPs, where kartogenin is conjugated via a photocaged linker on the surface (Figure 3D) (Li et al., 2016). Under local exposure to NIR light, the drug could be released from the UCNPs internalized by cells, inducing chondrogenic differentiation at reduced dosage compared to other mehtods. Ultrasmall super-paramagnetic iron-oxide (USPIO) has also gained attention as a carrier due to its biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and non-immunogenicity in biological systems (Ramaswamy et al., 2009; Hachani et al., 2016). Yang and colleagues synthesized amino-functionalized USPIO nanoparticles through surface modification and then grafted kartogenin onto the surface, providing stable magnetic resonance signal during cartilage regeneration (Yang, Zheng et al., 2019; Yang, Zhu et al., 2019).",
        "Polyamidoamine, with its well-defined nanoscale architecture, multivalency, and structural versatility, can also serve as a carrier for drug delivery (Cheng et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016). Hu and colleagues fabricated and compared two different kartogenin-polyamidoamine conjugates (Figure 3C): one with the drug bound to the surface of nanoparticles (PPK) and another with the drugy conjugated to the end group of PEG (KPP). The KPP conjugate induced a higher expression of chondrogenic markers compare to PPK, attributed to the shielding effect of PEG for PPK (Hu et al., 2017).",
        "The composition, structure, and biological activity of nanoparticles can be manipulated to regulate the loading and release of kartogenin, as well as their suspension stability and cellular uptake, ultimately controlling their functional efficacy.",
        "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a collection of bio-macromolecules that have a filamentous architecture. It plays a crucial role in directing cell attachment, proliferation, and maintaining cell phenotype through structural support and biochemical cues (Theocharis et al., 2016; Prince & Kumacheva, 2019). Nanofibers, as a sub-class of biomaterials, exhibit structural similarity to the natural ECM. Their high surface area to volume ratio makes them suitable for surface modification, which enhances cell attachment, enables high drug loading, and improves mass transfer properties (Sill & von Recum, 2008; Ku & Park, 2010; Ding et al., 2019).",
        "Nanofibers can be produced by electrospinning or extrusion methods (Li et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014). Various modification strategies have been developed, including co-electrospinning (Li et al., 2011; Samavedi et al., 2011), physical absorption (Qian et al., 2018; Han et al., 2019), and chemical immobilization (Wu et al., 2019). Electrospinning, in particular, is a simple and efficient method for fabricating multifunctional nanofibers. It utilizes electric fields to pull out charged fibers with diameters in the range of several hundred nanometers. Several bioactive drugs, including kartogenin, have been successfully incorporated into electrospun nanofibers for controlled release (Jiang et al., 2014). Yin et al. designed coaxial electrospun nanofibers with kartogenin encapsulated in the core (Figure 4A), allowing for sustained and stable release over a period of approximately two months (Yin et al., 2017). Similarly, Silva et al. developed kartogenin-loaded coaxial poly (glycerol sebacate)/PCL aligned nanofibers (Figure 4B), which exhibited sustained release of kartogenin and induced chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs (Silva et al., 2020). Chemical cross-linking has also been employed for loading kartogenin onto nanofibers. In our previous research, a multi-functional nanofiber scaffold for interface tissue regeneration was developed, where kartogenin was cross-linked to the polydopamine coating on the surface of silk fibroin nanofibers (Figure 4C) (Chen et al., 2021). This core-shell nanofiber scaffold shows promise for the integration of tendon-bone. Furthermore, Zhu et al. fabricated an engineered scaffold for regenerating tendon–bone enthesis in rotator cuff tear (RCT) by utilizing nanofibers’ structural guidance and the biological effects of kartogenin (Zhu et al., 2019). Their results demonstrated that scaffold loaded with 100 μM KGN significantly promoted chondrogenic and tenogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells. This engineered scaffold holds potential as a tissue engineering approach to enhance tendon–bone healing in RCTs.",

        "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are naturally released lipid bilayer-delimited particles, including exosomes and microvesicles, with diameters ranging from 50 to 200 nm. These vesicles have the capability to encapsulate various bioactive molecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, which can be transferred to recipient cells, modulating their cellular functions (Théry et al., 2018; Mathieu et al., 2019).",
        "Exosomes, in particular, have gained significant attention as crucial mediators of intercellular communication and molecular trafficking (Edgar, 2016). Jing et al. investigated the potential of utilizing small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) as a biomimetic tool to induce chondrogenesis in MSCs (Jing et al., 2020). Their findings revealed that sEVs released from kartogenin-preconditioned hUCMSCs contained specific miRNAs that could be transferred to native MSCs, promoting their chondrogenic differentiation by targeting TAOK1, a negative regulator of the Hippo pathway. Xu et al. developed a method to load kartogenin into exosomes through electroporation. The encapsulated KGN could be released from exosomes, with approximately 50% release observed within 24 hours. Utilizing exosomes enhanced the effective concentration of KGN within cells and significantly promoted the chondrogenesis of MSCs both in vitro and in vivo (Xu et al., 2021). Despite the growing research on the effects of EVs as a delivery platform, certain limitations exist. For instance, native EVs are not inherently designed for targeted cargo delivery; instead, cargos are non-selectively delivered to various cell types in vivo. However, with a deeper understanding of EVs, it is expected that better strategies will be developed to optimize their design and functionality.",
        "In order to achieve specific cellular responses and facilitate new tissue formation, macroscopic materials used for cell or chemical agent delivery should possess biomimetic properties and incorporate components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Ravindran et al., 2012). In the field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, the implantation of biodegradable and biocompatible scaffolds containing growth factors or other active molecules could be implanted in target areas can gradually promote tissue healing and restore its original function (Zhang et al., 2009). This section focuses on the review and discussion of kartogenin-loaded macroscopic materials and their applications.",
        "Hydrogels are a class of large molecules composed of interconnected hydrophilic polymer chains that maintain a high water content while retaining their 3D structure and physical integrity through physiochemical crosslinks. These hydrogels exhibit a soft consistency, low interfacial tension, and high biocompatibility, closely resembling native tissue (Li & Mooney, 2016). Their ability to be tailored for site-specific and sustained drug delivery has made them widely utilized in regenerative medicine (Hoffman, 2012; Gaharwar et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2022). Particularly in tissue engineering, hydrogels are highly suitable for promoting tissue healing and regeneration (Drury & Mooney, 2003; Tan & Marra, 2010; Alge et al., 2013; Zhang & Khademhosseini, 2017).",
        "Hyaluronic acid (HA), a major component of ECM in the skin and various connective tissues, is a natural, biocompatible, biodegradable polysaccharide that exhibits low immunogenicity. It serves as an ideal hydrogel material for culturing and transplanting various cells (Tan et al., 2009; Ha et al., 2015). For instance, Zhu et al. developed an injectable kartogenin-conjugated chitosan/HA hydrogel with sustained kartogenin release, which effectively promoted differentiation in the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral disks (Zhu et al., 2017). Similarly, Yuan et al. loaded hydrophobic kartogenin into the hydrophobic cavity of β-CD modified with an aldehyde group β-CD-CHO (OCD) through host–guest interactions. The kartogenin-loaded OCD was then immobilized on the HPCH via a Schiff-base reaction, leading to sustained release and subsequent differentiation of MSCs into chondrocytes (Figure 5C) (Yuan et al., 2023). Additionally, Liu et al. achieved sustained release of kartogenin by integrating it into the hydrophobic internal cavity of β-CD-AOI2 (Liu et al., 2020). These drug-loaded nanoboxes were covalently photo-crosslinked with methacryloyl HA to incorporate them into the hydrogel’s covalent network, triggering chondrogenesis. Based on this, the research group developed a semi-embedded, biomimetic, biphasic osteochondral scaffold by combining 3D-printed hydroxyapatite scaffold with layer-specific release of stem cell differentiation inducers, achieving simultaneous reconstruction of osteochondral defects (Liu et al., 2020).",

        "Incorporating nanomaterials with hydrogels offers advantages in drug delivery. For example, in Dai’s study, kartogenin was loaded into PLGA microspheres through the emulsification–evaporation method, which were then embedded in collagen-based hydrogel (Figure 5D) (Dai et al., 2023). Similarly, Fan et al. grafted kartogenin onto polyurethane nanoparticles through the EDC/NHS condensation reaction, achieving a loading efficiency of 14%. These nanoparticles were encapsulated into aldehyde methacrylate sodium alginate and amino gelatin hydrogels for in situ cartilage repair (Fan et al., 2018, 2020). Another approach involves loading the drug onto the nanomaterial before integrating it with the hydrogel, combining the advantages of both. For instance, Xu et al. fabricated a unique gelatin supramolecular hydrogel via a ‘Host-Guest Macromer’ approach without chemical modification or direct crosslinking of the biopolymers (Feng et al., 2017). Kartogenin was mixed into the supramolecular hydrogel, leading to enhanced in situ osteochondral regeneration through the sustained delivery of chondrogenic molecules (Xu et al., 2019).",
        "There are other types of hydrogel. Halloysite nanotubes and laponite were used as a novel carrier system for kartogenin delivery by Massaro et al. (2019). Halloysite, which offers selective functionalization of its inner and outer surfaces, is frequently employed for drug carrying and delivery (Massaro et al., 2018), while laponite has the ability to form injectable thixotropic hydrogel in aqueous solution (Boyer et al., 2018). Dextran, with its high water absorption and good biocompatibility, can be cross-linked to from ECM-like hydrogels similar to chondroitin sulfate in structure (Ito et al., 2007). Yang et al. used dextran hydrogels as a carrier for kartogenin-modified USPIO for cartilage repair. Additionally, Dehghan et al. incorporated kartogenin into the N-(β-maleimidopropyloxy) succinimide ester modified chitosan hydrogel, adding β-Glycerophosphate to achieve both thermosensitivity and sustained kartogenin release (Figure 5A) (Dehghan-Baniani et al., 2020). In Zhang’s work, kartogenin was incorporated into a composite hydrogel comprised of positively charged chitosan (CS) and methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) polymers (Figure 5B) (Zhang et al., 2022). This composite hydrogel achieved well-control release of kartogenin, satisfying the initial high drug concentration requirement while maintaining long-term sustained release.",
        "Porous scaffolds play a crucial role in creating three-dimensional (3D) environments that support cell survival and have shown great potential in tissue regeneration, as evidenced by various clinical trials (Seo et al., 2014; Offeddu et al., 2016). Several techniques, such as 3D printing (Li et al., 2017; Bittner et al., 2019), salt-leaching (Landau et al., 2017; Mahapatra et al., 2019), and freeze drying (Yang et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2018), have been employed to fabricate porous scaffolds. These scaffolds offer advantages such as increased drug loading capacity and the ability to achieve customized release profiles, creating an optimal environment for controlling cell fate (Oh et al., 2007).",
        "In a study by Westin, a porous chitosan-xanthan gum matrix was utilized, and kartogenin was reversibly attached to the scaffold to evaluate its effects on the chondrogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cell (Westin et al., 2017). The results demonstrated the potential of kartogenin in the treatment of cartilage related lesions. Sun et al. incorporated kartogenin-loaded PLGA microspheres into collagen/chitosan/hyaluronic acid sodium salt porous scaffolds, creating a biomaterial with chondrogenic capacity for cartilage repair and the treatment of osteoarthritis (Sun et al., 2018). Additionally, Xuan et al. designed and fabricated shape-memory ternary scaffolds with chondrogenic capacity for cartilage repair, incorporating immobilized kartogenin and enabling minimally invasive implantation and restoration at body temperature (Xuan et al., 2020). These responsive scaffolds hold promise not only for cartilage repair but also for the delivery of other active molecules or protein drugs. Li et al. presented an alternative approach using 3D printing to create a poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffold as a backbone, which was subsequently modified with KGN-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres. This strategy enhanced meniscus regeneration through controlled release of kartogenin from the 3D porous scaffold (Figure 6) (Li et al., 2021).",

        "These studies demonstrate the potential of porous scaffolds as vehicles for kartogenin delivery in tissue regeneration applications. The incorporation of kartogenin within the scaffolds enhances their chondrogenic properties and promotes cartilage repair. The use of various techniques, such as reversible attachment, microsphere embedding, and 3D printing, provides versatility in scaffold design and drug delivery strategies. Further research and development in this field hold promise for advancing cartilage regeneration and the treatment of cartilage-related disorders.",
        "In this review, we have provided a comprehensive overview of kartogenin, highlighting its physical, chemical, and biological properties, as well as its regulatory abilities in cell differentiation and potential for application in tissue repair. We have emphasized recent advancements in the design and fabrication of kartogenin-functionalized biomaterials, both at the nanoscale and macroscopic levels, and discussed their applications in regenerative medicine. Kartogenin exhibits improved functionality when combined with biomaterials that modify its physicochemical and surface properties, leading to enhanced synergistic effects. Over the past decade, kartogenin has witnessed significant progress in its biofunctions and applications, expanding our understanding and promoting its therapeutic potential.",
        "Despite the achievements of kartogenin, several scientific challenges and potential issues remain. Firstly, further exploration of its induction mechanism is necessary, although it is widely acknowledged that kartogenin possesses the ability to induce cell differentiation and offers advantages in cartilage-related tissue repair and regeneration compared to other biological factors. However, conflicting reports exist regarding the efficacy of kartogenin. For instance, Doran et al. found that the chondrogenic induction by kartogenin was far weaker than that of TGF, suggesting its limitations as a drug for cartilage regeneration (Music et al., 2020). Furthermore, Miyatake et al. discovered that kartogenin did not effectively promote the synthesis of superficial zone protein, an essential component for joint homeostasis on the cartilage surface, and they concluded that its chondrogenic effects depend on cellular phenotype and differentiation status (Miyatake et al., 2016).",
        "Currently, most kartogenin research focuses on in situ injection, but oral administration offers a simpler and noninvasive route of application, which should be further investigated, particularly in combination with various biomaterials. Additionally, although various materials have been designed and functionalized with kartogenin, and in vitro release profiles have been studied, there is a scarcity of reports regarding the decomposition products or the actual drug dose in vivo. It is crucial to evaluate the effective utilization and safety of kartogenin and its degradation products before progressing to clinical use.",
        "Furthermore, there is a need to explore and develop novel biomaterials for incorporating, carrying, and releasing kartogenin. This includes the exploration of composites combining nanoscale and 3D materials, as well as materials responsive to temperature, pH, or light, to enhance targeting accuracy and synergistic effects. We believe that advanced strategies for biomaterial fabrication will enable the development of new functionalized carriers, overcoming the limitations of conventional carriers and providing safe and effective platforms for kartogenin delivery in the future.",

        "Vascular diseases, such as peripheral vascular disease and critical limb ischemia, are the dysfunction in blood circulation and blood flow, resulting from the narrowing of blood vessels.[\n\n1\n\n] This causes lack of blood supply to the peripheral tissues; thus hypoxia, inflammation, vascular damage, and muscle degeneration follow.[\n\n1\n\n] Not only the conventional strategies including surgical and endovascular techniques, but also the recent advancements of gene therapy, cell therapy, and tissue engineering are being studied to enhance treatment of these complications. Vascular regeneration is a crucial process in tissue engineering as the vascular system supports the providence of nutrients and oxygen to the engineered tissue.[\n\n2\n\n] Even though a few tissues are supplied with nutrients and oxygen through diffusion, engineered tissue with distant capillaries faces difficulties.[\n\n2\n\n] Angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel formation from a pre‐existing mature vascular bed composed of arteries, capillary networks, and veins.[\n\n3\n\n] This involves a sequential and multistep process, which starts with an activation of a quiescent endothelium by angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and angiopoietin‐2 (ANG‐2).[\n\n4\n\n] Transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β), platelet‐derived growth factor B (PDGF‐B), ephrin‐B2, and NOTCH help maturation of a nascent blood vessel to be functional.[\n\n4\n\n] Arteriogenesis causes vascular smooth muscle cells to enlarge and support the endothelial cell channels.[\n\n4\n\n] In response to these vascular network formation processes, delivering the necessary growth factor and building vascular networks are needed in tissue engineering.",
        "Among several ways to deliver the growth factor, scaffold‐based system allows incorporation of growth factors in the scaffold and local release at the specific site.[\n\n5\n\n] Cryogel is a type of scaffold fabricated with chemical cross‐linking at subzero temperature. Due to its swelling property and highly interconnected porous structure, a cryogel shows the potential in biomedical applications: drug delivery, tissue engineering, and wound healing.[\n\n6\n\n] Previous studies have focused on the use of heparin as a biomaterial moiety for growth factors to bind to.[\n\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n\n] Heparin is a negatively charged glycosaminoglycan that enables binding of a growth factor through electrostatic interactions.[\n\n10\n\n] Incorporating heparin into a cryogel resulted in a controlled release of a growth factor, such as VEGF, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), and nerve growth factor (NGF).[\n\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n\n]\nKim et al. fabricated a cryogel by conjugating an amine group in gelatin type A and carboxyl group in heparin via 1‐ethyl‐3‐(3‐(dimethylamino)‐propyl) carbodiimide and sulfo‐hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS).[\n\n7\n\n] They could successfully make an injectable cryogel with rapid shape‐recovery property, which could be injected in vivo to enhance neovascularization.[\n\n7\n\n] Due to its injectability, cryogel could be applied to the injury site non‐invasively. Additionally, Park et al. utilized chondroitin sulfate methacrylate (CS‐MA) and chitosan methacrylate (Chi‐MA) to form cryogel through radical polymerization initiated with ammonium persulfate (APS) and N,N,N’‐tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED).[\n\n11\n\n] They further added poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) as a supplementary polymer to stabilize the microporous structure. Pulverizing the developed cryogel and loading them with VEGF could enhance injection potential and angiogenesis.[\n\n11\n\n] Not only loading of a single growth factor, but a sequential release of VEGF and BMP4 enabled bone regeneration.[\n\n9\n\n] A double cryogel system consisted of VEGF‐loaded gelatin/heparin cryogel surrounding the BMP4‐loaded gelatin/chitosan cryogel in the core.[\n\n9\n\n] As VEGF is initially released from gelatin/heparin cryogel, it resulted in angiogenesis in an in vivo cranial defect model.[\n\n9\n\n] A subsequent sustained release of BMP4 from gelatin/chitosan cryogel further facilitated bone regeneration.[\n\n9\n\n] Even though the biomaterials that had been previously used are biocompatible, biodegradable, and bioactive, providing the host cells with a growth factor in extracellular matrix would further enhance the function of the biomaterial. Recent advancements in biomaterials include decellularization techniques. Decellularization refers to the removal of cellular components from the tissues, leaving an acellular extracellular matrix (ECM). Among different types of tissues, porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM) contains the structural elements such as collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and growth factors that can improve cell growth, proliferation, and attachment.[\n\n12\n\n] In addition to the structural elements, another advantage of UBM is the minimal immunogenicity.[\n\n12\n\n] Urinary bladder wall is divided into four layers, which are the urothelium, the lamina propria, the muscular layer, and the serosal layer.[\n\n13\n\n] Lamina propria is highly porous and rough in texture that is appropriate for cell infiltration, and the intact epithelial basement membrane composes of proteins such as collagen IV and VII that allow cellular anchoring and migration. By preserving these components from the basement membrane with a supercritical carbon dioxide decellularization technique, we expected this biomaterial to be biocompatible and nonimmunogenic.[\n\n14\n\n]",
        "Here, we have utilized the supercritical fluid‐based decellularized porcine urinary bladder matrix extracellular matrix (dECM) and heparin to fabricate a cryogel (dECM/heparin). This cryogel is capable of anchoring VEGF, thereby providing a sustained release and resulting in angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. First, we characterized the cryogels with different concentrations of dECM and heparin. Each condition was assessed for cytotoxicity and cellular proliferation. We then examined the effect of angiogenesis in vitro via cell scratch assay, tube formation assay, and RT‐qPCR. Based on the in vitro result, we have tested its effect in vivo in a mouse hindlimb ischemic model to examine the blood perfusion change.",
        "We utilized decellularized porcine urinary bladder matrix extracellular matrix, which was decellularized with a supercritical fluid‐based method. Cross‐linking with heparin, dECM/heparin cryogel was fabricated at −20 °C for 24 h and lyophilized overnight to have a porous network. In order to examine different types of cryogels using different concentrations of dECM and heparin, we fabricated cryogels with lower dECM and heparin concentrations and higher dECM and heparin concentrations. Cryogels with lower dECM and heparin concentrations were composed of 1% (w/v) dECM (D1) and 1:1 and 2:1 w/w ratio of heparin (H1 and H2). 1:10 w/w ratio of DMTMM to dECM was used as a cross‐linker. As a result, cryogels with lower dECM and heparin concentrations were named D1H1 and D1H2. Cryogels with higher dECM and heparin concentrations were composed of 2% (w/v) dECM (D2) and 1:1 and 2:1 w/w ratio of heparin (H2 and H4). Similarly, a 1:10 w/w ratio of DMTMM to dECM was used, and the final products were D2H2 and D2H4. Detailed composition is presented in Figure \n1B. When swollen, cryogels with lower dECM and heparin concentrations were more transparent in color than cryogels with higher dECM and heparin concentrations; however, they all could remain their shapes (Figure 1C).",

        "Cross‐linking of dECM and heparin was analyzed with FT‐IR. dECM alone, heparin alone, and dECM/heparin cryogel were analyzed, and the transmittance peaks were evaluated (Figure \n2A). Transmittance peaks at 3300 cm−1 showed a stretching frequency of N─H in amide group, and 1630 cm−1 showed a C═O stretching of an amide I. Lastly, the peak at 1550 cm−1 showed N─H bending of an amide II. Cryogels are characterized to have a porous structure with an interconnected network. In order to examine the pore structure of cryogels, we have looked into the mini‐SEM images of a cross‐sectioned cryogel (Figure 2B).",

        "As the concentration of heparin increases in both cryogel groups, the pore sizes were more homogeneous (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Cryogels with lower dECM and heparin concentrations had bigger pore sizes than cryogels with higher dECM and heparin concentrations (Figure 2C). In addition to a structural component, we figured out the mechanical properties, such as swelling ratio, interconnected porosity, and Young's modulus, of the scaffolds. Both groups of cryogels showed a decrease in swelling ratio and interconnected porosity as the concentration of heparin increased (Figure 2D,E). This is related to the pore size of the scaffold. As the pore size decreases with the increasing heparin concentration, scaffolds are less likely to swell and contain an interconnected porosity. Not only does the concentration of heparin contribute, but those properties are also related to the extent of cross‐linking. Cryogels with higher dECM and heparin concentrations showed a lower swelling ratio and interconnected porosity when compared to cryogels with lower dECM and heparin concentrations. However, their Young's modulus were significantly higher than that of the cryogels with lower dECM and heparin concentrations (Figure 2F). Increasing the concentration of heparin also affected the increase of Young's modulus (D1H1: 35.74 ± 4.92 kPa, D1H2: 103.74 ± 0.83 kPa, D2H2: 308.97 ± 104.93 kPa, D2H4: 686.76 ± 218.65 kPa). Moreover, the degradation rate of the cryogels were measured in 0.2 and 1 unit mL−1 of collagenase (Figure 2G,H). Cryogels fabricated with lower concentrations of dECM and heparin (D1H1 and D1H2) degraded faster than cryogels with higher concentrations of dECM and heparin (D2H2 and D2H4). Furthermore, when we used higher concentration of collagenase (1 unit mL−1), the degradation rate was faster compared to 0.2 unit mL−1.",
        "In addition to the mechanical properties, rheological properties such as strain‐sweep and frequency‐sweep were assessed by measuring the rheological moduli: storage modulus (G’) and loss modulus (G″). Rheological properties display the deformation and cross‐linking degree of the material. First, we carried out the strain‐sweep test, which measures the stability of network against deformation with the increasing deflection at the constant frequency. For all the cryogels, G’ value was higher than G″, indicating that the cryogels had a gel‐like or solid structure and not liquid (Figure \n3A,B). G’ and G″ values increased with the increasing heparin concentration in a cryogels with lower dECM and heparin concentrations (Figure 3A). However, it was difficult to observe this trend in cryogels with higher dECM and heparin concentrations (Figure 3B). G’ and G″ values of cryogels with higher dECM and heparin concentrations were greater than that of lower concentration cryogels, which represented a stiffer property. Second, we conducted the frequency‐sweep test with a constant strain of 5%. Frequency‐sweep test observes the cross‐linking degree and inner structure of a cryogel by measuring G’ and G″ in the range of non‐deformative strain range. Here also shows a G’ > G″, and the values are slightly increasing in both cryogel groups (Figure 3C,D). G’ and G″ of cryogels with higher dECM and heparin concentrations displayed enhanced moduli than lower concentration cryogels. This indicated the cross‐linking degree of cryogels with higher dECM and heparin concentrations was higher than that of lower concentration cryogels.",

        "With characteristics, cryogels are known to recover rapidly and have an injectability property. We confirmed this by squeezing the cryogel with forceps. All cryogels could successfully recover their shapes after being squeezed (Figure S2A, Supporting Information). For the injectability test, we used a 17G needle syringe to inject cryogel (Figure S2B, Supporting Information). Even though all cryogels could be injected and recovered their shapes, cryogels with lower dECM and heparin concentrations showed a better performance in shape recovery as higher concentration cryogels were slightly dismantled and had dECM debris after injection (Figure S2C,D, Supporting Information). The weight loss after injection was greater for higher concentration cryogels as they were harder to be injected (Figure S2E, Supporting Information). This suggested that lower concentration cryogels were more suitable for injection.",
        "Cytotoxicity and cell proliferation ability with the dECM/heparin cryogels were measured with LIVE/DEAD assay and Cell Counting Kit‐8 assay. LIVE/DEAD solution stained the live cells with calcein‐AM in green and dead cells with ethidium homodimer‐1 in red (Figure \n4A). Conditioned medium that contained cryogels was provided to HUVECs, and viability was measured after 24 h. Both groups of cryogels were not cytotoxic to cells, but D2H4 cryogel showed a lower viability compared to other groups (Control: 98.66 ± 0.93%, D1H1: 98.57 ± 1.10%, D1H2: 99.41 ± 0.43%, D2H2: 97.38 ± 2.53%, D2H4: 89.18 ± 4.56%) (Figure 4B). There was no statistical significance among the studied groups, except for the D2H4, which possessed lower cell viability compared to other groups.",

        "For cell proliferation, we used the same conditioned medium and cultured HUVECs for three days. We have calculated the number of cells in each condition every day and examined the cell proliferation rate. Until day 2, cells with dECM/heparin cryogels proliferated more than the control group, but cryogels with higher dECM and heparin concentrations proliferated in a slower rate in day 3 than control and lower concentration cryogels (Figure 4C).",
        "Angiogenic potential of VEGF‐loaded dECM/heparin cryogel were assessed with cell migration assay, tube formation assay, and RT‐qPCR. VEGF165, the most abundant and functional isoform of VEGF‐A monomers, plays an important role in regulation of the endothelial cell function.[\n\n16\n\n] As the guidance cue, such as VEGF, is present in dECM/heparin cryogel, we expected this would cause cell migration and tube formation, which are commonly used to evaluate the angiogenic potential in vitro. We compared the VEGF‐unloaded and VEGF‐loaded dECM/heparin cryogel groups with negative control after giving the conditioned media. To avoid confusion, VEGF‐loaded dECM/heparin cryogel is labeled with _VEGF. The conditioned media were made by filtering EBM with 2% FBS and 1% anti‐anti after incubating with cryogel or VEGF‐loaded cryogel (D1H1_VEGF or D1H2_VEGF) for 24 h. We expected the conditioned medium to contain VEGF and dECM contents released from the cryogel. Figure \n5A depicts that the percentage of wound closure was 54.41 ± 2.08% for D1H1_VEGF and 48.28 ± 9.71% for D1H2_VEGF, which were higher than a VEGF‐unloaded dECM/heparin cryogel (32.57 ± 6.82%). The presence of VEGF in the cryogel enhanced endothelial cell migration. When compared to negative control (13.30 ± 9.04%), a cryogel without VEGF also showed a higher percentage of wound closure. However, the difference between the control group and cryogel was not significant nor did the difference between D1H1_VEGF and D1H2_VEGF (Figure 5B).",

        "In addition to cell scratch wound healing assay, a tube formation assay was done to quantitatively analyze pro‐angiogenic potential in vitro. Endothelial cells, upon exposure to angiogenic signal, such as VEGF, align to form lumen‐containing tubules.[\n\n17\n\n] In Figure 5C, VEGF‐loaded groups (D1H1_VEGF and D1H2_VEGF) showed a tube formation after 12 h of incubation in Matrigel. Similar to cell migration, VEGF‐loaded dECM/heparin groups (D1H1_VEGF and D1H2_VEGF) showed more meshes, nodes, branches, and junctions than VEGF‐unloaded dECM/heparin groups (Figure 5D–G). Among VEGF‐loaded cryogels, tube formation occurred slightly less for the cryogel with a higher concentration of heparin (D1H2_VEGF) although there was no significant decrease. This trend of having higher pro‐angiogenic potential in a lower heparin concentration may be explained by the amount of VEGF released. While both D1H1_VEGF and D1H2_VEGF demonstrated a controlled release of VEGF over five days, D1H1_VEGF released more VEGF than D1H2_VEGF. D1H1_VEGF released 15.81 ± 0.30% of the initially loaded VEGF, and D1H2_VEGF released 13.52 ± 1.08% (Figure \n6A), suggesting that the higher VEGF release from D1H1_VEGF contributed to its greater angiogenic activity. We postulate that heparin helps anchor VEGF to the scaffold, but heparin with a higher concentration limits the release of bound VEGF.",

VEGFR‐1 is expressed in endothelial cells and contribute to a regulatory function in VEGF signaling.[\n\n18\n\n] ANG1 is known as an angiogenesis regulator at the late stage and contributes to vessel stability and maturation.[\n\n19\n\n] CD31 is found on the surface of endothelial cells and involved in the endothelial cell–cell adhesion for neovascularization.[\n\n20\n\n] The relationship between heparin concentration and these angiogenic gene expressions could not be drawn from the results, but VEGF‐loaded cryogels (D1H1_VEGF and D1H2_VEGF) showed an upregulation of those four genes compared to VEGF‐unloaded cryogel (control) (Figure 6B–E). Considering the characteristics and in vitro angiogenic potential of the lowly crosslinked cryogels, we selected D1H1 as an optimal cryogel composition among others. D1H1 had a homogenous pore structure with a large pore size and adequate stiffness that could result in high swelling ratio and interconnected porosity. Additionally, it can hold VEGF so that it does not burst release in a short period of time and can stimulate cell migration and tube formation. For these reasons, we conducted further in vivo experiments with D1H1 cryogel.",
        "The neovascularization potential of a VEGF‐loaded dECM/heparin cryogel (D1H1_VEGF) was studied in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model. The mouse hindlimb ischemia model was induced by ligating a femoral artery. To evaluate the changes in blood perfusion in an ischemic limb, we have treated an ischemic limb with D1H1 and D1H1_VEGF. Blood perfusion after the surgery explicitly showed that all groups were induced with hindlimb ischemia as the blue color on the limb represented a blockage of the blood flow (Figure \n7A). Blood perfusion was tracked on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28, and the corresponding laser Doppler perfusion index (LDPI) was plotted (Figure 7B). Until day 7, there was a higher blood perfusion in D1H1 and D1H1_VEGF groups when compared to sham group. From day 14 to 28, D1H1 and D1H1_VEGF groups showed a significantly higher blood perfusion than sham group. Especially for D1H1_VEGF, the blood perfusion of the ischemic limb was 79.5% recovered. The salvage score on day 28 also supported this result (Figure 7C). Not only did D1H1_VEGF cryogel show a limb recovery, but D1H1 cryogel itself helped in the limb salvage to a certain extent.",

B) Quantification of blood perfusion by laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) ratio. C) Necrosis score indicating the salvage score of the hindlimb on day 28.

        "After 28 days, mice were sacrificed, and the tissue at the injury site was collected for immunostaining of α‐SMA that stains the smooth muscle cells in the blood vessels. Figure 7D represents the α‐SMA staining with green fluorescence and DAPI staining with blue fluorescence of the cross‐section of the hindlimb tissue. With respect to the previous results, D1H1_VEGF group showed the highest number of vessels, and D1H1 group followed. Even though D1H1 group exhibited a low degree of angiogenesis, it showed a significant number of vessels when compared to sham group, which corresponds to the result in Figure 7B (Figure 7E). This further supports the regeneration and angiogenesis potential of UBM dECM.",
        "We investigated cell infiltration in the VEGF‐loaded dECM/heparin cryogels with H&E staining. Hematoxylin‐stained cell nucleus in purple, and eosin‐stained extracellular matrix and cytoplasm in pink. VEGF‐loaded cryogel integrated in the host tissue, and there showed cell infiltration into a scaffold after 28 days as cell nuclei stained in purple are bound to a surface of the scaffold (Figure 7F). Further analysis is needed to distinguish which kinds of cells were infiltrated into a scaffold.",
        "Scaffold‐based tissue engineering utilizes a scaffold with either cells or biomolecules or both to facilitate the regeneration of tissues. In this study, we loaded VEGF in a cryogel scaffold constructed with dECM and heparin to regenerate the vascular system. The amine group of dECM and the carboxyl group of heparin were cross‐linked via 4‐(4,6‐dimethoxy‐1,3,5‐triazin‐2‐yl)‐4‐methylmorpholinium chloride (DMTMM). As dECM primarily consists of proteins that possess free amine groups, and heparin contains carboxyl group, we employed DMTMM, a cross‐linker capable of reacting with amine and carboxyl groups to form amide linkage, hence utilized to fabricate the cryogel.[\n\n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n\n] Unlike 1‐ethyl‐3‐(3‐dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and sulfo‐hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), DMTMM does not need a pH control during the chemical reaction and easy to use.[\n\n23\n\n] With the ease of fabrication, we further characterized the scaffolds with different concentrations of dECM and heparin.",
        "The pore size of a scaffold is crucial in tissue engineering as it can vary the extents of cell migration, attachment, and growth.[\n\n24\n\n] Small pores hinder cell infiltration into the center of a scaffold as there is less diffusion of nutrients and oxygen.[\n\n24\n\n] Large pores hinder cell attachment as there is limited surface area.[\n\n24\n\n] Previous studies have suggested that scaffolds with large sized pores (160–270 µm) are superior in rapid and extensive angiogenesis.[\n\n25\n\n] Considering this, we hypothesized that cryogels fabricated with a low concentration of dECM and heparin that consisted of a large pore size would be suitable for angiogenesis study. We observed that D1H1 and D1H2 cryogels had a bigger pore size with a higher swelling ratio and interconnected porosity and lower Young's modulus than dECM/heparin cryogels fabricated with higher concentration of dECM and heparin (D2H2 and D2H4). An increase in concentration of heparin also reduced the pore size, swelling ratio, and interconnected porosity while increasing Young's modulus. Even though increasing stiffness is related to an increase in cell migration and sprouting, the cells do not tend to form a tube when the stiffness of a scaffold is too high or too low.[\n\n26\n\n] Soft tissues such as neutral tissues have 1–4 kPa, and the tissues that are exposed to high mechanical loading exhibit greater stiffness; for example, the heart is 10–15 kPa.[\n\n27\n\n] Since angiogenesis is an essential function that the scaffold needs in vivo, D1H1 and D1H2 cryogels were favored.",
        "Before loading any growth factor, we examined the biocompatibility of dECM/heparin cryogel. As described in 3.3., all cryogels were biocompatible while D2H4 showed a lower viability and cell proliferation. It was previously studied that a high concentration of heparin inhibits cell proliferation and growth, and a higher concentration may result in cell apoptosis.[\n\n28\n\n] In addition, a negative charge of heparin may hinder cell migration and adhesion (Figure S3, Supporting Information).[\n\n8\n\n] Therefore, we selected D1H1 and D1H2 for further in vitro angiogenesis study. When we loaded VEGF for further angiogenesis study, morphology of a cryogel changed to a small extent. VEGF‐loaded cryogel (D1H1_VEGF) was smaller than VEGF‐unloaded cryogel (D1H1) (Figure S4A, Supporting Information). Furthermore, VEGF loading resulted in lower swelling ratio and interconnected porosity. We hypothesize that these results were influenced by lyophilization of D1H1_VEGF and VEGF‐heparin binding. VEGF‐bound dECM/heparin cryogels showed higher angiogenic effects in HUVECs than VEGF‐unbound dECM/heparin cryogels when cell scratch wound healing assay and tube formation assay were conducted. Introduction of VEGF in endothelial cell is known to stimulate cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.[\n\n29\n\n] Similarly, our RT‐qPCR results pointed out higher gene expressions of VEGFR‐1, VEGFR‐2, PECAM‐1, and ANG1. This corresponded to previous studies with VEGF.[\n\n7\n, \n9\n, \n11\n\n] Considering the mechanical properties and angiogenic potential in vitro, we chose D1H1 as an appropriate carrier for VEGF in vivo. We induced hindlimb ischemia in mouse and implanted a dECM/heparin cryogel (D1H1) and VEGF‐loaded dECM/heparin (D1H1_VEGF) to observe blood perfusion recovery. Murine hindlimb ischemia model is commonly used as a model of PAD to test new therapies with new materials or drugs.[\n\n30\n\n] Without any treatment, hindlimb ischemia worsened, and the limb got amputated; however, when treated with dECM/heparin cryogel (D1H1) and VEGF‐loaded dECM/heparin cryogel (D1H1_VEGF), blood perfusion was restored as time passed. As expected, D1H1_VEGF showed the highest blood flow recovery rate, and D1H1 followed. Furthermore, immunohistochemically stained images were in agreement with in vivo results. This is promising because the biomaterial of a scaffold itself provided a neovascularization effect to a certain extent. UBM is widely used as an acellular scaffold and has been known to facilitate tissue regeneration and repair.[\n\n31\n\n] However, all those growth factors and proteins that are preset in UBM may not all be retrieved when going through the decellularization process. There are several ways to decellularize tissue: physical, chemical, and enzymatic protocols.[\n\n32\n\n] Physical decellularization methods such as hydrostatic pressure and sonication damage the ECM structure and do not completely remove DNA fragments.[\n\n33\n, \n34\n\n] Chemical and enzymatic approaches using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Triton X‐100, or trypsin EDTA eliminate the DNA components better than a physical approach, but there remains a possibility of denaturing proteins.[\n\n34\n\n] Because our material was decellularized ECM with a supercritical CO2 decellularization technology, we expected that the biomaterial itself would help repair the blood flow. Further detailed studies regarding the composition of supercritical fluid‐based dECM, especially composition of its angiogenic potential, would pave the way for understanding the functional properties of this biomaterial. As this cryogel is easily fabricated and displays a sustained release of VEGF, this has the potential to be used not only for neovascularization but also in various tissue engineering fields with different growth factors.",
        "In this study, we fabricated a porcine decellularized UBM ECM‐based cryogel as a carrier for VEGF. Varying the concentration of dECM and heparin, we optimized the cryogel suitable for neovascularization. The swelling ratio, interconnected porosity, and Young's modulus were influenced by the concentrations of dECM and heparin as the swelling ratio and interconnected porosity decreased and Young's modulus increased with increasing concentrations of dECM and heparin. All the cryogels were biocompatible and did not adversely affect cell proliferation; however, the cryogels with higher dECM and heparin concentrations showed a slower cell proliferation rate than control and cryogels with lower dECM and heparin concentrations. Between D1H1 and D1H2, lower heparin concentration (D1H1) resulted in more release of VEGF due to their larger pore size and smaller number of heparin‐VEGF binding domain. As we tested angiogenic potential in vitro with the conditioned medium that each cryogel released VEGF for one day, D1H1 group showed a better angiogenic potential than D1H2. In addition to cell scratch assay and tube formation assay to assess angiogenesis, pro‐angiogenic gene expressions of HUVECs increased significantly. In vivo results indicated that VEGF‐loaded dECM/heparin (D1H1_VEGF) exhibited a faster rate of blood vessel regeneration than dECM/heparin cryogel without VEGF (D1H1). Because D1H1 cryogel itself also resulted in some recovery, we could suggest that our cryogel was effective in delivering VEGF for neovascularization. By changing VEGF with other growth factors, our cryogel would be promising for delivering various growth factors for further biomedical applications.",
        "Supercritical fluid‐based decellularized urinary bladder ECM was kindly provided by DOF Inc, Korea. dECM solution was prepared by dissolving 2% (w/v) dECM in 10% (w/v) pepsin from porcine gastric mucosa (P7125; Sigma–Aldrich, USA) and 0.05 m hydrochloric acid (7647‐01‐0; Duksan, Korea) in deionized water.

For these assays, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) in their passages 4–7 and the conditioned medium were used.

However, with regard to the harsh environment constituted by degenerated IVDs, protecting biologics from in situ degradation while allowing their long-term delivery is a major challenge. Yet, the design of the optimal approach for IVD regeneration is still under debate and only a few papers provide a critical assessment of IVD-specific carriers for local and sustained delivery of biologics. In this review, we highlight the IVD-relevant polymers as well as their design as macro-, micro-, and nano-sized particles to promote endogenous repair. Finally, we illustrate how multiscale systems, combining in situ-forming hydrogels with ready-to-use particles, might drive IVD regenerative medicine strategies toward innovation.

      "title": "Development of a mechanical adaptable, moisture retention capable, injectable and adhesive organohydrogel for nucleus pulposus repairing",
      "abstract": "Abstract Developing mechanical adaptable injectable gel with nucleus pulposus (NP) repairing capability for minimally invasive treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is of great importance in medical practice. In current work, inspired by the outcomes of polyvinyl alcohol and glycerol based injectable organohydrogel (GPG) in IDD control and the great potential of animal glue in tissue adhesion, a novel injectable and self-crosslinking adhesive organohydrogel GPG-AG was fabricated. The mechanical performance of the GPG-AG was systematically studied, possessing viscoelastic properties close to NP accompanied with strong adhesion to intervertebral disc to avoid dynamic loading induced leakage postinjection. In addition, the swelling behavior, water retention capability and degradation of the organohydrogel in situ was also explored. In vitro cellular test showed the as-fabricated organohydrogel was able to upgrade aggrecan expression while downregulate matrix metallopeptidase-13 (MMP-13) synthesis. Astoundingly, the organohydrogel revealed anti-inflammation potential of alleviating excessive reactive oxygen species, consequently creating a favored microenvironment for NP repairing.

        "Developing mechanical adaptable injectable gel with nucleus pulposus (NP) repairing capability for minimally invasive treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is of great importance in medical practice. In current work, inspired by the outcomes of polyvinyl alcohol and glycerol based injectable organohydrogel (GPG) in IDD control and the great potential of animal glue in tissue adhesion, a novel injectable and self-crosslinking adhesive organohydrogel GPG-AG was fabricated. The mechanical performance of the GPG-AG was systematically studied, possessing viscoelastic properties close to NP accompanied with strong adhesion to intervertebral disc to avoid dynamic loading induced leakage postinjection. In addition, the swelling behavior, water retention capability and degradation of the organohydrogel in situ was also explored. In vitro cellular test showed the as-fabricated organohydrogel was able to upgrade aggrecan expression while downregulate matrix metallopeptidase-13 (MMP-13) synthesis. Astoundingly, the organohydrogel revealed anti-inflammation potential of alleviating excessive reactive oxygen species, consequently creating a favored microenvironment for NP repairing. The corresponding in vivo study showed the outcome in intervertebral disc height index of the GPG-AG treated group after needle puncture was superior to previously reported GPG and control group. Taken together, this organohydrogel is expected to serve as a promising candidate for IDD control.",
        "Low back pain (LBP) stands as one of the primary causes of global disability [1, 2], characterized by discomfort located between the lower rib margin and the buttocks [3–5]. With progressed understanding of LBP, intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration has emerged as a pivotal contributing factor leading to this disease, along with increasing prevalence as global population aging acceleration [6, 7]. Physiologically, the IVD comprises a central, hydrated NP, surrounded by the lamellar annulus fibrosus (AF) and adjacent to the vertebral cartilage endplate (CEP). Among these physiological components, NP plays a vital role in supporting and transmitting spinal movement stress, cushioning external forces, maintaining disc shape and restricting vertebral motion range [8]. NP degeneration, driven by aging and chronic overload in daily life, is recognized as a key instigator of IDD, accompanied by a progressive loss of proteoglycan, type II collagen and resident cells. These alterations lead to adverse changes in the NP's water content and shock-absorbing capacity, ultimately compromising AF integrity and resulting in symptomatic LBP through abnormal and repetitive mechanical loading [9, 10].",
        "Control of IDD by mitigating NP degradation poses a significant challenge in medical practice. Various strategies, including pharmacotherapy and physical rehabilitation therapy, have been applied for this purpose [11, 12]. However, long-term clinical trials of these attempts have demonstrated only limited and transient efficacy in pain relief [13]. When these conservative therapies fail to yield satisfactory outcomes, surgical interventions, such as disc replacement or spinal fusion, may be considered [14–16]. However, according to long-term follow-up results, new clinical symptoms were observed after surgery [17, 18]. In spite of that, the success rate of these interventions in restoring the local microenvironment, alleviating IDD and providing lasting relief from LBP remains suboptimal.",
        "As IDD initially manifests in NP tissue, this physiological event thereby inspires worldwide efforts to restore the function and structural integrity of NP tissue [19]. However, a major obstacle in NP repair is the tissue's inherently limited self-regenerative capacity and progressive decline in physiological function. Given that NP tissue is characterized by its high hydration and gel-like consistency, which provides shock-absorbing properties, injectable gels have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for NP restoration and regeneration [20–23]. This strategy aims to alleviate IDD via a minimally invasive organohydrogel injection, which provides temporary mechanical support and bioactive cues for disc regeneration without requiring structural resection or fixation of the spine, thereby maintaining its intrinsic motion activity [24, 25].",
        "To date, researchers have documented successful applications of hydrogels loaded with therapeutic drugs or cells for the treatment of IDD, with the purpose of creating a favorable microenvironment for NP regeneration. However, most injectable hydrogels used for NP repair undergo chemical crosslinking from a pre-gel state, which raises concerns regarding potential toxicity from cross-linking agents, insufficient gelling reactions and unpredictable changes in hydrogel characteristics and cargo behavior in vivo [26]. In addition, the mechanical properties of most reported hydrogels used for IDD treatment do not match the mechanical properties of natural NP tissues, nor can they provide continuous mechanical support in the IVD environment. Long-term overloading has been established as a key factor contributing to gradual NP tissue degradation and the failure of NP regeneration processes.",
        "In recent years, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel has become a research hotspot in the treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration because of its similar mechanical properties to NP, but it can only provide mechanical support and lacks the biological activity to promote tissue repair [27–29]. To solve this problem, researchers added growth factors (such as TGF-β, GDF5) to PVA gel to activate the repair mechanism [30, 31]. However, growth factors are easy to be degraded by enzymes in the body, and conventional carriers are difficult to continuously release, resulting in a rapid decline in effective concentration and failure to achieve long-term repair. In a pioneering study by our group, a hydrogen bond crosslinked injectable organohydrogel (GPG) formulated by PVA and glycerol was reported, which could mechanically mimic native NP tissue in terms of load absorption and transfer postinjection [20]. This organohydrogel has no significant effect on nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) under mechanical loading, and plays a certain role in repairing the IDD rat model. However, subsequent investigations revealed that this organohydrogel exhibited poor substrate adhesion, raising concerns about its potential migration under repeated mechanical overloading. Besides, despite its impressive water adsorption and retention ability, chemical stability and biocompatibility, the organohydrogel possesses insufficient elasticity, unfavored stiffness and limited bioactivity to induce NPCs generating extracellular matrix (ECM), which in consequence drives the investigation interest of PVA-based composite organohydrogel with additional modification.",
        "Animal glue (AG) is a type of adhesive extracted from collagen proteins of mammals or fish [32, 33]. There are various types of AG on the market, such as animal skin and bone glue, fish maw glue, turtle shell glue and gelatin [34]. AG is mainly composed of collagen I, elastin, glycosaminoglycans and amino acids, and has been used as a wood adhesive and supplement in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries [35, 36]. Several groundbreaking studies have demonstrated the superiority of AG in tissue repair [37, 38]. For example, Xiao's team [39] has developed an AG based adhesive with excellent adhesion and minimal inflammatory response, suitable for wound healing and tissue engineering [40, 41]. However, it is worth noting that AG exhibits poor water resistance unless chemical crosslinking is applied. Considering the limited water content in NP and the exceptional adhesive and biological potential of AG, it is intriguing to integrate it into the developed GPG organohydrogel to develop a mechanical adaptive and tissue adhesive organohydrogel for NP repair.",
        "Injectable hydrogels for intervertebral disc degeneration repair face critical challenges of insufficient bioactivity and poor mechanical compatibility. To address these limitations, this study developed a dynamically cross-linked GPG-AG organohydrogel through a ‘mechano-biological’ synergistic strategy. The system features a dual-network structure: a covalently cross-linked PVA/glycerol network provides fundamental mechanical stability, while glycerol's plasticizing effect enables dynamic network reconstruction to prevent brittle fracture typical of rigid materials. Simultaneously, AG forms complementary topological structures through physical entanglement with the PVA network, endowing the material with enhanced injectability and energy dissipation properties. The bioactive components in AG further promote tissue regeneration by regulating cellular behaviors. Notably, our facile preparation method utilizing commercially available AG cross-linked with the PVA/glycerol system yields a viscoelastic organohydrogel with dual functional advantages. This organohydrogel is expected to serve as an effective in situ platform for absorbing loads and maintaining the biological and structural integrity of degenerating NP.",
        "Commercially available AG was purchased from Huizhou Qinjian Tools and Musical Instrument Accessories Co., Ltd., China. Conversely, PVA and glycerol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, China and Sigma-Aldrich, USA, respectively.",
        "AG was soaked in deionized water at a 1:2 mass ratio, followed by exposure to a 65°C water bath with magnetic stirring to generate a viscous AG solution. Subsequently, a 5-min ultrasound treatment was applied to eliminate bubbles formed during the stirring process. Meanwhile, 1.2 g of PVA was dissolved in 18.8 ml of deionized water and stirred at 95°C to obtain a PVA solution. Then, 28.2 ml of glycerol was slowly added to create a well-mixed viscous GPG solution as described in our prior work [20]. Different volumes of the AG solution were added to the GPG solution (with GPG: AG volume ratios of 0.5:9.5, 1:9, 1.5:8.5 and 2:8), stirred at 65°C until a homogeneous PVA-glycerol-animal glue (GPG-AG) solution was achieved. All viscous solutions were later transferred to molds and allowed to cure at room temperature to obtain organohydrogels for further characterization. For comparison, GPG and AG organohydrogels were prepared via curing their precursor solutions and evaluated following the similar procedure of GPG-AG organohydrogel.",
        "The gelation time of GPG, AG and GPG-AG gels were measured at room temperature (RT) using the vial-inversion method, with the time recorded as the point when the sample could support its own weight. Furthermore, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was conducted to investigate the interactions between glycerol, PVA and AG during curing.",
        "Cyclic compression tests were conducted on gel cylinder samples with a diameter of 15 mm and a height of 10 mm using a mechanical testing machine (CMT6104, China) operating at a speed of 10 mm/min. During these tests, the sample was compressed to a constant strain of 30%, and then, unloaded back to 0. Additionally, static compression tests were performed to determine the compression modulus of each specimen, which was calculated using the slope of the stress–strain curve at a strain of 10%.",
        "A rheometer (AR2000, TA Instruments, USA) was used to evaluate the rheological properties of various formulated organohydrogels using a plate-to-plate setup. The parameters were set to 1% strain, with angular velocities ranging from 0.1 to 10 Hz at 37°C. The GPG-AG organohydrogel formula that exhibited the most NP tissue-like viscoelastic behavior was selected for further analysis.",
        "The injectability of prepared viscous solution was compared via measuring the force required to move the plunger to discharge the substance in syringe, known as dynamic slip force (DGF). Briefly, an uncured organohydrogel solution was loaded into a 10 ml syringe equipped with a 22 G needle and mounted onto the universal mechanical testing machine. The loading unit of the machine was set to a compression rate of 10 mm/min to simulate manual injection. The injection force during the process was recorded, and the DGF value was measured to assess the injection capacity of the solution.",
        "An ex vivo sheep vertebrae model was utilized to investigate the distribution of organohydrogel solution postinjection, involving complete removal of the NP tissue and endplates. In test, uncured GPG, AG and GPG-AG gel solution with volume similar to the sucked NP was injected through the AF layer, and the distribution of the solution within the center of the IVD was visualized. Conversely, sample solution was injected to an intact intervertebral disc and exposed to 12 N load to check the leakage risk of injected organohydrogel visually.",
        "The wettability of the as-prepared organohydrogel was determined by measuring the contact angle equipment (CA, JC2000DM, China) in the sessile drop mode at room temperature.

The droplet's morphology was imaged, and the corresponding contact angle was recorded.",
        "The relationship between the swelling capacity and the incubation time of the organohydrogel sample in water was established by measuring its free absorption capacity at regular intervals. The initial mass of the organohydrogel specimen in the wet state was noted as W0. The organohydrogel was then soaked in deionized water at room temperature and weighed every 60 min until it reached mass equilibrium. The final weight was recorded as Ws, and the swelling rate could be calculated using the following equation:",
        "The water retention capability of organohydrogel was tested via incubating specimens in chamber set at 37°C and 50% relative humidity.

        "In reference to ISO 10993-5, the cytocompatibility of organohydrogels was assessed by culturing rat NPCs (Wuhan Pricella Biotechnology Co., Ltd) using organohydrogel extracts for 1 and 3 days. The cells cultured with DMEM/F12 medium were set as the control group. Organohydrogel specimen was sterilized using 48 h ultraviolet light irradiation and incubated in 37°C DMEM/F12 cell culture medium at the ratio of 0.1 g/ml to prepare the extract. The as-prepared extract was then filtered using a 0.22 μm filter and mixed with 10% fetal bovine serum. NPCs were seeded into 96-well plates at a cell density of 5000/well and cultured for 24 h before exposing to extract. Subsequently, the cell culture medium was replaced with the extract and after 1 and 3 days the cell numbers were determined using CCK-8 kit. Meanwhile, in the control group cells were directly exposed to DMEM/F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Conversely, the viability of NPCs in the extracts for 24 h was assessed using live/dead staining and photographed using fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, the expression levels of ECM components such as collagen type II (Col II), aggrecan (ACAN) and MMP-13 were assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence staining techniques.",
        "Due to the persistent ischemic and hypoxic conditions within NP tissue during IDD, the equilibrium between the generation and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is severely perturbed. This event can gradually induce accumulation of substantial ROS cluster products in situ, activating downstream inflammatory signaling cascades. To simulate the oxidative stress microenvironment of the IVD, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a prototypical ROS, was selected. By employing staining techniques, we aimed to demonstrate the resistance of NPCs to this oxidative stress within the presence of organohydrogel extracts.",
        "Prior to staining, a concentration of 100 μM H2O2 was introduced into the culture medium for 24 h to mimic the degenerative and inflammatory conditions within the IVD. A control group was maintained in normal culture medium without any oxidative stress induction. The experimental group involved incubating NPCs, pre-exposed to H2O2, with the organohydrogel extract for an additional 24 h. The inflammation protection capabilities of the organohydrogel were evaluated using ROS and Lipid peroxidation (LPO) staining methods. The test kits were purchased from Shanghai Beyotime Bio-chemical Technology Co., Ltd., In addition, the effect of organohydrogel extract on MMP13 expression in cells were also studied using fluorescence staining. In addition to imaging ROS level in cells using staining kit, fluorescence microplate reading method was also applied for ROS level evaluation. In brief, NPCs were cultured with different medium for 24 hours, digested with trypsin, and neutralized with serum-free medium, after which the cell suspension was transferred to centrifuge tubes and centrifuged to collect the cells; the cell pellet was resuspended in DCFH-DA working solution (10 μM, diluted in serum-free medium), incubated at 37°C in the dark for 30 minutes to ensure sufficient probe-cell contact, centrifuged again to collect the cells, washed 2-3 times with serum-free culture medium to completely remove extracellular DCFH-DA, resuspended in serum-free culture medium, seeded into a 96-well black microplate at 100 μl per well, and analyzed for intracellular ROS fluorescence intensity using a fluorescence microplate reader at an excitation wavelength of 500 nm and emission wavelength of 525 nm.",
        "Conversely, the interaction of organohydrogel extract and macrophage cells was investigated. Briefly, RAW 264.7 macrophages (Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank) were seeded into a 6-well plate and treated with lipopolysaccharide for 24 h to elicit cellular polarization. In the control group, they were maintained in normal culture medium in the absence of any stimulatory agent. In the experimental step, activated macrophages were incubated with organohydrogel extract for 24 h. Immunofluorescence staining techniques were employed to study the expression levels of both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis was utilized to quantify the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in testing groups.",
        "All animal experiments conducted in this study have been approved by the Orthopaedic Animal Use and Care Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (20220758). 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 8 weeks were used in study. Following anesthesia administration, the skin of the rat tails was disinfected with alcohol and area of the C4-C5 intervertebral disc was marked using a marker pen. A 27-gauge needle was used to fully penetrate the AF layer, allowing for aspiration of the NP tissue. Complete removal of the NP tissue was indicated by the disappearance of sucking resistance. Subsequently, organohydrogel was injected into the center of NP.",

        "To preserve the load absorption capacity and structural integrity of compromised IVD, we developed a novel composite organohydrogel formed by previously reported GPG and an adhesive and bioactive AG. It was hypothesized that glycerol molecules could form multiple hydrogen bonds with both PVA and AG, leading to the formation of organohydrogel networks (Figure 1A). The gelation tests demonstrated that GPG, GPG9-AG1 and AG solutions could transit from a fluid-like state to a gel in the tube inversion test, with gelation times estimated to be 4.1 ± 0.19 h, 4.3 ± 0.1 h and 0.47 ± 0.06 h, respectively (Figure 1B and C). The fast gelation of AG was attributed to the high amount of gelatin derived from collagen during animal glue preparation. When exposed to room temperature, water molecules in the gelatin solution gradually become trapped within the gelatin network, forming a semi-rigid gel. Such gel-transition phenomena of organohydrogel enable their injection and temporary mechanical support in NP repairing practice.",

        "A universal mechanical testing machine was used to conduct mechanical tests on the organohydrogel respectively at 30% compressive strain. It can be seen from Figure 2A that the higher AG content in GPG-AG, the higher stiffness could be witnessed. The slope of the first 10% strain segment in the stress-strain curve is defined as the compressive modulus of the sample, as shown in Figure 2B. Due to the superior elasticity of AG to GPG, the compressive elastic modulus of GPG-AG organohydrogel group showed an AG content dependent increase, in which the value is increased from 2.61 ± 0.11, 3.24 ± 0.09, 5.14 ± 0.02 kPa, 9.10 ± 1.10 kPa, to 19.01 ± 0.80 kPa, respectively. According to literature, the modulus of the human NP is 5.39 ± 2.56 kPa [42], close to the value of GPG9-AG1.",

        "Conversely, the rheological properties of tested organohydrogels are depicted in Figure 2C–G, where it is evident that the energy storage modulus (G′) of all GPG-AG organohydrogels exceeded the energy dissipation modulus (G″), indicative of their viscoelastic solid state. As the concentration of AG increased, G′ exhibited an upward trend, attributed to the superior elasticity and stiffness of AG compared to GPG. Specifically, when subjected to a 1 Hz oscillation frequency, the GPG and GPG-AG organohydrogels exhibited energy storage modulus of 101.5 ± 0.81 Pa, 175.5 ± 6.7 Pa, 365.4 ± 1.68 Pa, 715.3 ± 17.4 Pa, 1139.7 ± 90.4 Pa, respectively. Notably, the G′ value of the organohydrogel with a GPG to AG ratio of 9.0:1.0 (365.4 Pa) approximated the G′ value of natural pig NP at 307 Pa [43]. Figure 2H shows the loss coefficient of organohydrogel. As the concentration of AG increases, the loss coefficient gradually increases, coupled with increasing viscosity and decreasing elasticity. Consequently, GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel comprising 90% GPG and 10% AG was chosen for further investigation.",
        "Furthermore, the stress–strain curve of both GPG and GPG9-AG1 are shown in Figure 3A and B in which GPG breaks at about 62% strain, while GPG9-AG9 gel breaks at about 78% strain. These results indicated the latter one can withstand greater loads in practice. This can be explained by the greater mechanical performance of AG over GPG and the glycerol-mediated crosslinking could provide an energy-dissipating mechanism, both endowing energy absorbing capability to the as-formed GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel. The time scan results of GPG and GPG9-AG1 under alternating strain of 100% and 1% (Figure 3C and D) show that when they were at 1% strain, their G′ was greater than G″, indicating their viscoelastic solid state. When the strain increased to 100%, G′ dropd sharply and was lower than G′, indicating that the network structure of the organohydrogel was damaged. Finally, when the strain recovered to 1%, G′ and G″ immediately returned to their initial values, demonstrating their ability to heal rapidly. These observations also confirmed the superior reliability of GPG9-AG1 over GPG in restoring the mechanical environment of degenerated NP.",

        "Regarding NP located in the core of IVD, the injection capability of organohydrogel to NP was evaluated (Figure 4A). The injection forces of GPG and GPG9-AG1 in a 10 ml syringe equipped with a 22G needle are depicted in Figure 4B. Regarding the superior viscosity of GPG9-AG1 over GPG, more force was needed to carry out injection. The DGF during injection was estimated to be 10.37 ± 0.37 N and 25.28 ± 2.85 N, respectively (Figure 4C). Considering that an injection force of 40–50 N is generally convenient for most individuals [44], GPG9-AG1 can thereby smoothly injected by hand despite its higher viscosity to GPG. Conversely, both GPG and GPG9-AG1 were injected to NP site of ex vivo sheep vertebrae model. After 12 h of curing, both GPG and GPG9-AG1 were found to fully distributed in the NP location, as seen in Figure 4D and G. In addition, we found that under the unloaded condition after injection, as shown in Figure 4E and H, there was no leakage, while under the compressed postinjection, leakage of GPG fluid was witnessed at the injection hole on AF generated by needle punctuation (Figure 4F). In contrast, no leakage of GPG9-AG1 was found (Figure 4I), implying its superior adhesive capability to GPG. AG contains amino acids such as lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg), which play an important role in the adhesion capability of materials by providing additional surface binding opportunities and repelling hydration layers. In addition, amino groups are believed to amplify cation-π interactions and enhance cohesive properties [45], playing a crucial role in protein and peptide self-assembly, molecular cohesion and adhesion and the formation of secondary structures [46, 47].",

        "The results of physical-chemical characterizations of GPG9-AG1 are demonstrated as follows: First, FTIR analysis was conducted to investigate the interaction between AG, glycerol and PVA (Figure 5A). The results revealed a shift in the -OH stretching peak and the C-O stretching vibration peak of AG in GPG9-AG1. Specifically, these peaks shifted from 3279.02 cm−1–3268.25 cm−1 and from 1030.26 cm−1–1036.71 cm−1, respectively [48–51]. Interestingly, in subsequent water incubation test, it was found cured AG show poor resistance to water invasion (Figure 5B). This behavior was caused by the weakening of interactions between molecular chains in solidified gelatin, which prevented the formation of a stable networked structure. On contrast, the GPG9-AG1 maintained its structure in water, possibly by the formation of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between glycerol molecules and collagen I, elastin and glycosaminoglycan found in AG.",

        "Second, the wettability of GPG9-AG1 was assessed using the contact angle measurement method [52]. As illustrated in Figure 5C, the water contact angle of GPG9-AG1 (15.2 ± 2.97°) was significantly lower than that of pure AG (41.57 ± 1.99°) and GPG (27.27 ± 6.02°), suggesting its superior surface hydrophilicity. The improvement of hydrophilicity of organohydrogel is beneficial to cell adhesion and growth, and promotes tissue repair.",
        "The results of the swelling test are summarized in Figure 5D. It was noteworthy that GPG exhibited limited water absorption capacity with a swelling rate of 1.5 ± 0.1%, potentially due to the crosslinked network formed between glycerol and PVA. As an alternative, AG demonstrated superior swelling ability (126 ± 18.7%), consistent with its poor water resistance addressed above. When AG was incorporated into GPG, the swelling rate increased to 14.9 ± 3.1%, as a comprehensive result of water affinity of AG and the formed crosslinked network among glycerol, PVA and AG. Additionally, the water retention rates of GPG9-AG1 and GPG were close when incubated at 37°C and 50% relative humidity for 14 days (Figure 5E). Conversely, the AG hydrogel lost 65.8% of its mass during the test. This outcome could be explained by the superior moisture retention capability of glycerol over glycosaminoglycan and collagen. The moisturizing properties of glycerol come from two aspects. On the one hand, the large number of hydrogen bonds formed between glycerol molecules and water molecules inhibit the evaporation of water; On the other hand, due to the hygroscopicity of glycerol itself, it can continuously capture water molecules from the surrounding environment. As the IVD degenerates, the ability of the NP tissue to absorb water decreases, leading to a decrease in IVD elasticity and deterioration of the microenvironment. The excellent water retention performance of glycerol can thereby restrict the water loss in NP to some extent. To further evaluate the degradation behavior of GPG9-AG1 and GPG, both organohydrogel specimens were incubated in PBS. As depicted in Figure 5F, after 14 days postimmersion, GPG exhibited a weight loss of 35%, while GPG9-AG 1experienced only a 21.6% weight loss. This difference could be caused by the hydrogen bond formation between glycerol and AG, enabling longer duration of GPG9-AG1 in NP to provide mechanical support and motivate tissue repairing.",
        "As shown in Figure 6A, CCK-8 test method was used to evaluate the cell viability of GPG9-AG1 gel extract to verify its cytocompatibility. After incubating the NPCs with the organohydrogel extraction solution for 1 and 3 days, the cytotoxicity of organohydrogel specimens were compared. As shown in Figure 6A, no significant difference was found among the control, GPG and GPG9-AG1 group. The corresponding Live/Dead staining results shown in Figure 6B also confirmed the cytocompatibility of the GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel extract. The RT-PCR results (Figure 6C–E) revealed the expression of ACAN genes were greatly upregulated in GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel group along with the MMP-13 gene greatly downregulated. These observations indicate the GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel is cytocompatible and prone to accelerating ECM regeneration of NP.",

        "Regarding the pathological microenvironment in degenerated IVD, the equilibrium between the production and elimination of ROS is severely disrupted, stimulating downstream inflammatory pathways in consequence [53–56]. ROS induced LPO plays a critical role in cell death, characterized with disturbance of cell membrane organization and accompanied functional loss and modification of its proteins and DNA bases. The effect of organohydrogel extract on LPO protection was evaluated by applying a LPO fluorometric assay kit to H2O2 treated NPCs. The kit can provide a fluorescent probe that can detect LPO production in cells via reacting with the lipid free radicals in the LPO pathway. In test, the probe fluorescence green with the process of LPO, paving the possibility to measure the degree of LPO qualitatively and quantitatively. As shown in Figure 7A, compared with normal cells, H2O2 treated cells appeared significant green fluorescence intensity increase due to LPO level increase. However, when cells were exposed to both organohydrogel extract and H2O2, weakened green fluorescence was witnessed. Figure 7D shows the semi quantitative results of the fluorescence intensity of LPO. The outcomes implied GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel extract can protect cells from LPO significantly. On one hand, glycerol may be involved in cell protection against ROS via stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing intracellular ROS production [57, 58]. On the other hand, the AG can provide antioxidant in LPO restriction [59, 60].",

        "Conversely, the level of ROS in H2O2 treated NPCs was also investigated. As shown in Figure 7B of representive ROS staining, the presence of GPG9-AG1 could significantly restrict the ROS related green fluorescence intensity. The similar results were witnessed using fluorescence microplate reading shown in Table 1. These observations were in agreement with the results found in LPO test. Besides, regarding MMP13 plays vital roles in degrading ECM and COL-II of NP, the impact of organohydrogel extract on MMP13 expression in NPCs were also studied. The immunofluorescence staining showed that GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel reduced the expression of MMP-13 in the presence of H2O2 (Figure 7C).",

        "Next, macrophages were also used to investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel extract. Typical anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 and pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. As shown in Figure 8, LPS pre-activated macrophages were incubated with organohydrogel extract by immunofluorescence staining. Subsequently, immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of IL-10 and TNF-α in different groups. The staining results showed that GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel extracts significantly inhibited TNF-α and promoted IL-10 compared with the control group without LPS stimulation (Figure 8A and B). The RT-PCR results (Figure 8C–E), GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel showed significant immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. The detection results of CD206, a marker for M2 macrophages, showed that the gene expression level in the LPS stimulated group was significantly reduced to 0.52 ± 0.05 times that of the control group, while the GPG based material group partially restored expression to 1.22 ± 0.05 times, but its promotion of M2 polarization was still significantly weaker than that of the GPG9-AG1 treated group at 1.43 ± 0.22 times (an increase of 175% compared to the LPS group). At the level of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 expression, LPS stimulation significantly downregulated its gene expression level, while the GPG9-AG1 treatment group successfully reversed this trend and restored IL-10 expression to no statistically significant difference compared to the healthy control group. Regulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α: LPS stimulation increased its expression level to 4.00 ± 0.44 times that of the normal group. Although GPG-based materials can partially inhibit the inflammatory response, adjusting it to 2.30 ± 0.11 times decreased it by 42.5% compared to the LPS group. However, the GPG9-AG1 treatment group showed superior anti-inflammatory efficacy, accurately regulating TNF-α expression to 1.29 ± 0.02 times, a decrease of 67.8% compared to the LPS group, and no significant difference from normal physiological status. RT-PCR further verified that GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel can effectively promote M2 phenotype polarization of macrophages and reduce inflammatory reaction. M2 macrophages play multiple important roles in the process of NP repair, including inhibiting inflammatory responses, promoting tissue repair and reconstruction and regulating immune responses [61]. They secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 to suppress inflammatory responses, help alleviate tissue damage and repair damaged tissues [62]. In the late stage of inflammation, M2 macrophages can also inhibit the recruitment and activation of immune cells, thereby reducing further inflammatory responses [63–65]. In addition, M2 macrophages can promote fibrosis processes and help stabilize and repair damaged tissues. Therefore, the activation of M2 macrophages by GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel is suggested to alleviate IDD in situ.",

        "The change of intervertebral disc height index (DHI) is an important indicator for evaluating the level of IDD in vivo. Image J analysis software was used to measure the height of intervertebral discs and their adjacent vertebral bodies in the normal group, puncture group, GPG group, GPG9-AG1 group to calculate the DHI (Figure S6). The results showed that after 4 weeks postsurgery, the intervertebral disc height in the puncture group was reduced in the order of GPG9-AG1, GPG and puncture group, implying the as-fabricated organohydrogel as a certain therapeutic effect on IDD control (Figure 9A and B). Multidimensional morphological evaluation of intervertebral disc tissue was performed through H&E staining and Safranin O/Fast Green dual staining (Figure 9C). Experimental results indicated that GPG9-AG1 organohydrogel significantly promoted the repair of degenerated intervertebral discs. The normal control group displayed a typical hierarchical disc structure: the NP exhibited a plump elliptical morphology with uniformly distributed type II collagen networks, the annulus fibrosus showed densely arranged lamellar structures, the cartilaginous endplate line presented an intact undulating morphology and the subchondral bone structure remained undamaged. Compared to the normal group, the puncture injury group demonstrated characteristic degenerative changes: significant atrophy of the NP region, a drastic reduction in type II collagen content, multiple interlamellar fractures and torsional deformities in the annulus fibrosus, and disrupted continuity of the cartilaginous endplate line. The GPG control group showed partial improvement compared to the injury group, but the NP tissue was nearly absent, and the annulus fibrosus structure exhibited discontinuous alignment. The GPG9-AG1 treatment group revealed unique reparative characteristics: despite local compressive deformation in the annulus fibrosus caused by puncture manipulation, the NP region maintained near-normal cellular density, the extracellular matrix displayed a homogeneous three-dimensional reticular distribution of type II collagen expression, the endplate structure remained intact with a continuous undulating cartilaginous line, and the degree of degeneration was lower than that in both the injury group and GPG group.",

        "The rheological test results show that GPG9-AG1 has solid gel properties, and the G′ and G′′ of GPG9-AG1 are comparable to the natural NP. In addition, due to the dynamic fracture/restoration of hydrogen bond generated by PVA and glycerol, organohydrogel can withstand the mechanical cycle compression and show effective energy dissipation, with a certain degree of self-healing GPG-AG can adhere to the disc tissue to prevent leakage. GPG9-AG1 gel has good hydrophilicity and water retention, and can maintain water. In vitro cell experiments have shown that GPG9-AG1 has good biocompatibility, inhibits lipid peroxidation, and clears ROS. In addition, it can promote the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors and improve the microenvironment of the NP. Animal experiments show that GPG-AG organohydrogel significantly restores the height of intervertebral disc, promotes the repair of NP and effectively inhibits the degeneration of intervertebral disc.",
        "The GPG-AG organohydrogel exhibits multidimensional advantages over chitosan-based or hyaluronic acid injectable gels [66, 67]. Its dynamically reversible hydrogen-bonded network endows the hydrogel with viscoelastic properties that closely match those of native NP tissue and exceptional fatigue resistance, effectively avoiding the stress-shielding effects common in traditional gels. In terms of biocompatibility, GPG-AG induces M2 macrophage polarization, promotes NPCs proliferation and facilitates matrix nutrient exchange, whereas materials like chitosan may exacerbate inflammatory responses. Therapeutically, the hydrogel alleviates annular fibrosus stress by restoring intervertebral disc pressure, synergistically upregulates Aggrecan expression and drives the regeneration of type II collagen and proteoglycans, significantly outperforming purely mechanical-support gels [28, 68]. By overcoming the long-standing trade-off between mechanical support and bioactivity in conventional materials, GPG-AG provides an innovative repair strategy for disc degeneration that integrates biomechanical compatibility, immunomodulation and matrix regeneration.",
        "The degradation kinetics of GPG-AG synergize with the NP repair process. Its dynamic hydrogen-bonded network enables time-dependent regulation of degradation rates through controlled dissociation, ensuring mechanical support in early stages and space release in later phases to guide endogenous regeneration. Meanwhile, degradation products modulate macrophage polarization to suppress fibrotic pathways and activate NP progenitor cell migration/differentiation, forming a ‘degradation-immunomodulation-regeneration’ positive feedback loop. This time-dependent functional transition achieves dynamic mechanical adaptation and bioactive synergy during degradation, ultimately providing progressive structural-functional restoration for degenerated discs.",
        "The GPG-AG organohydrogel developed in this study shows significant advantages in terms of mechanical adaptability, biological activity and repair effect of intervertebral disc degeneration, but there are still the following limitations that need further discussion:",
        "The thermosensitivity of AG poses a challenge of operational adaptability in clinical application. Its sol gel transformation needs to rely on special preheating equipment (such as constant temperature water bath) and extend the preparation time during operation. To improve clinical operability, immediate gelation during surgery can be achieved through material chemical modification strategies such as photoresponsive group modification (such as methacrylation) or enzyme triggered crosslinking (such as transglutaminase mediated), or through dosage form innovation (such as developing a freeze-dried powder liquid two-component instant mixing system), thereby avoiding the need for heat pretreatment.",
        "Although rat NPC experiments have shown that GPG-AG can inhibit lipid peroxidation, clear ROS and promote the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, there are species differences between rat and human NPCs in matrix metabolism (such as proteoglycan/type II collagen synthesis rate) and inflammatory regulatory pathways, which may affect the accuracy of efficacy prediction. Subsequently, its biological effects need to be validated by combining human NPCs or degenerative intervertebral disc organoid models.",
        "Injectable organohydrogel (GPG9-AG1) was prepared by a simple one pot method using PVA, glycerin and AG. The compression modulus of GPG9-AG1 is 5.14 ± 0.02 kPa, which is close to that of natural NP and can withstand about 78% of strain. The storage modulus of GPG9-AG1 organic gel is found to be 365.4 ± 1.68 Pa, equivalent to natural NP as well. Moreover, due to the dynamic fracture/restoration of hydrogen bonds between PVA, AG and glycerol, it can withstand cyclic loads and exhibit effective energy dissipation capabilities. In vitro studies have shown that GPG9-AG1 is non-toxic to NPCs and promote ACAN gene expression. In addition, this organohydrogel enabled ROS and LPO alleviation, MMP-13 inhibition and activate M2 macrophages activation, paving the possibility to regulate a favored microenvironment for NP tissue regeneration. In vivo studies have shown that GPG9-AG1 could maintain intervertebral disc height to some extent in NPD models as compared to GPG and blank control. The results indicate that GPG9-AG1 has great potential for transformation in the minimally invasive treatment of IVDD. GPG-AG organohydrogel shows an important clinical application prospect in the minimally invasive treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration, providing a dual mechanical biological repair function of mechanical adaptation and microenvironment regulation for degenerative intervertebral discs. To further promote transformation, it is necessary to focus on analyzing the key molecular mechanisms that regulate the inflammatory microenvironment, such as revealing its targets for inhibiting inflammatory responses and promoting NP repair through multi-omics techniques. In the process of promoting clinical translation, it is necessary to construct a long-term evaluation model for non-human primates (implantation period ≥ 18 months), systematically evaluate the in vivo metabolic trajectory of material degradation products, dynamic changes in local immune microenvironment and the long-term maintenance effect of intervertebral disc biomechanical function.",

        "Biopolymers and biocomposites have emerged as promising pathways to develop novel materials and substrates for biomedical applications. Moreover, the availability, processability, and low toxicity of biopolymers encourage their use in drug delivery and regenerative medicine. The engineering of biopolymer-based materials for their structuration at the nano- and microscale along with their chemical properties allows the design of advanced formulations used as carriers for drug products and as cell scaffolding materials. Finally, combination products including—or based on—biopolymers for controlled drug release offer a powerful solution to improve the tissue integration and biological response of these materials.",
        "In this Special Issue, original research and review articles ranging from the chemical synthesis and characterization of modified biopolymers to their processing in different morphologies and hierarchical structures and in vitro and in vivo evaluation have been gathered together with the aim of contributing to the progress in the biomedicine field.",
        "Recent findings on the applications and processing of biopolymers in the drug delivery area are presented. In a review article, Osorio et al. [1] described different polymer-based drug delivery systems, including polysaccharides and derived polysaccharides, used for the specific case of colorectal cancer treatments. In another biomedical application, Goel et al. carried out a preclinical study (New Zealand White rabbits model) to test the use of keratose, an oxidized form of keratin, as a drug excipient to control the release of paclitaxel, an anti-proliferative drug, from coated biomedical devices (angioplasty balloons) for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease [2]. The benefits of the presence of this biopolymer, in terms of minimizing the adverse impact of peripheral vascular motion on drug retention and reaching a favorable biological response, were assessed. From the processing point of view, López-Iglesias and coworkers [3] introduced a novel production strategy of solid lipid microparticles using a solvent-free technique, the so-called Particles from Gas-Saturated Solutions (PGSS®) process. Artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic tools were used to model the process in terms of temperature, pressure and nozzle diameter to obtain optimized microparticulate systems. The obtained lipid microparticles can be of a potential interest in several biomedical, food and environmental applications. In an alternative processing approach, a comprehensive review by Auriemma et al. presents a description of the theoretical and practical aspects behind the production of different polysaccharide-based hydrogel particles with a special focus on the prilling technology in tandem with several ageing and drying techniques [4]. The value of these techniques is related to its versatility and scalability. Moreover, the gel drying method is a critical step that makes it possible to obtain carriers with specific morphology and inner structure, which may have effects on the release properties. Particularly, the processing of dry polysaccharide-based gels, in the form of cryogels and aerogels, is an emerging field for drug delivery, and European initiatives (e.g., the European Commission-funded AERoGELS CA18125 COST Action) are currently ongoing, with the aim of displaying the full potential of these nanostructured materials for biomedical purposes [5,6]. In this regard, an alternative approach based on the synthesis starch cryogels from enzymatically modified starch combined with lyophilization has been reported by Boccia and coworkers [7]. The chemical nature plays a crucial role in the ability of the prepared cryogels from modified starch to act as drug carriers with promising applications for wound healing and for certain specific administration routes. Additionally, in an experimental application from Pantić et al. [8], tablet-shaped pectin aerogels and pectin aerogels coated with an external layer of chitosan were tested as carriers for oral administration of curcumin, being able to modify the release profile of this drug. Results showed that uncoated pectin aerogel provided a prompt curcumin release, whereas the multilayer biopolymer-based aerogel resulted in a carrier providing a prolonged release of the drug during 24 h.",
        "Advantageous uses of biopolymers as cell scaffolds or for extracellular stimulation were presented in this Special Issue for the development of diverse strategies and implant systems in the regenerative medicine field. In a review article by Alvarado-Hidalgo et al. [9], the recent uses and fabrication methods of biopolymers for extracellular biochemical stimulation of cells as biomimetic 3D scaffold systems were presented. The potential modulation of the extracellular environment through mechanical, electrical, and biochemical stimulation was introduced, with a particular focus on biophysical and biochemical cues of cells that drive their molecular reprogramming. An example of this concept was presented in the research article from Ramírez Sánchez et al. [10]. A smart conductive composite material was processed using κ-carrageenan as a doping agent to improve its electrical properties. The obtained material was electroactive and allowed the release of dexamethasone by electrochemical stimulation, providing a stable system to be used in bioelectronic applications. Finally, cellulose phosphate aerogels for biomedical uses were developed by Schimper et al. [11] through an environmentally friendly methodology based on the conversion of biomass into functional materials. The obtained derivatized cellulose aerogels can be beneficial for the design of dual-porous cell scaffolding materials with interconnected mesopores and micron-size pores.",

        "Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are nano- to micro-sized lipid bilayer membrane particles secreted by host cells, play critical roles in novel intercellular communication mechanisms, mediating the transduction of functional molecules with physiological activity, such as microRNAs, mRNAs, proteins, and lipids (Figure 1) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60]. The level of EVs in humans has gained attention for the early diagnosis of various diseases using liquid biopsy owing to their distribution in various body fluids, including blood, urine, saliva, spinal fluid, and tears, as well as their stability [61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107]. As the amount and type of these functional molecules present within or on the surface of EVs vary depending on the disease, they could be used for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targets [108,109,110,111,112,113,114]. EVs are classified into exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, based on differences in particle size and formation mechanisms [115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126]. Since exosomes can be regarded as a natural drug delivery system (DDS) that exists in the living body, they are widely used in drug discovery technologies [127,128,129,130,131]. Furthermore, since exosomes are abundant in numerous species and play a role in the transduction of molecular information between different species, research has focused on their application in various fields and elucidation of their mechanisms in various life phenomena and health and medical care. However, exosome analysis and sample preparation techniques, which form the basis of research, are still immature. Therefore, there is a need for the development of new technologies that can facilitate a breakthrough in the research of EVs as a therapeutic strategy. In this review, we summarize the latest studies on EVs and MSCs as novel therapeutic materials.",
        "MSCs are pluripotent stem cells with the ability to self-renew, regenerate, and repair deficient cells and the plasticity ability to differentiate into bone, cartilage, blood vessels, and cardiomyocytes, which are derived from the mesoderm [132,133,134,135,136,137,138]. Unlike embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, general stem cells, which are more abundant during early childhood than adulthood, support human growth. Stem cells, also called tissue stem cells, such as adult stem cells or somatic stem cells, are still present at maturity when apparent growth ceases and serve to replenish cells in damaged tissue throughout life [139,140]. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) present in the bone marrow have been studied for more than half a century and are being actively applied clinically [141]. The establishment of a treatment method using HSCs transplantation has expanded the possibilities of transplantation using other tissue stem cells [142,143,144,145]. However, depending on the tissue, such as the brain or heart, it is difficult to separate stem cells from the living tissue and for use as treatment. In recent years, MSCs have been the focus of attention because they are relatively easy to extract from various tissues, including the bone marrow, adipose tissue, placenta, umbilical cord, synovium, and pulp [146,147,148,149,150]. Furthermore, they can also differentiate into ectoderm-derived nerve cells and glial cells that perform functions such as supporting nerve cells and endoderm-derived hepatocytes [151,152,153,154]. Thus, MSCs have garnered attention as cell sources in regenerative medicine because they grow almost indefinitely in a culture dish and perform various functions, such as wound healing, immune regulation, and nerve regeneration; additionally, the therapeutic effects of MSCs against diseases are through their paracrine action rather than differentiation into specific cells. This paracrine action—namely, immune system control, angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory effect, antioxidant action, antiapoptotic action, and tissue repair action, in which cell secretions act on neighboring cells through direct diffusion and not on endocrine cells that act on distant cells via the general circulation—involves various cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-g), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and growth factors secreted by MSCs [155,156,157,158,159]. In particular, in MSC transplantation in cardiomyopathy, MSCs regulate the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to the attenuation of cardiac remodeling [160]. In addition, MSCs produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor-l (IGF-1), adrenomedullin, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which stimulate myogenesis and angiogenesis in the injured myocardium [161,162,163,164,165]. Thus, MSCs improve myocardial perfusion and regeneration by differentiating into cardiomyocytes.",
        "The minimum criteria for defining human MSCs are (1) adherence to plastics under standard culture conditions; (2) positive cell surface markers CD73, CD90, CD105, and negative CD11b or CD14, CD19 or CD79a, CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR; and (3) ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes [166]. Since MSCs express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, but not MHC class II, they are less likely to be attacked by natural killer (NK) cells and exhibit difficulty in developing humoral immunity. The MSCs used for clinical purposes are collected from various tissues such as bone marrow, umbilical cord, umbilical cord blood, and fat, and have important biological activities related to tissue repair, such as anti-inflammatory effect, proliferative factor secretion, and angiogenesis-promoting effects without the risk of tumorigenesis [167,168,169]. Furthermore, it is clear that the properties of MSCs differ depending on the organ from which they are collected. Adipose-derived MSCs, as well as bone-marrow-derived MSCs, have received a great deal of attention because they can be collected more easily and abundantly throughout the body, are less invasive, and have excellent organ repair and immunomodulatory abilities, compared with those of bone-marrow-derived MSCs [170,171]. Bone-marrow-derived MSCs comprise only approximately 0.01% of the cells in the bone marrow, whereas the number of adipose-derived MSCs in adipose tissue is 500 times that of MSCs in the bone marrow. Additionally, adipose-derived MSCs produce more growth factors, such as HGF and VEGF, that contribute to organ repair than those derived from bone marrow [172]. Furthermore, in addition to the ability to differentiate into fat, bone, and cartilage, similar to bone-marrow-derived MSCs, they have the ability to differentiate into the muscle, which is not derived from bone marrow. Although their cell morphology and differentiation potential are not different from those of bone-marrow-derived MSCs, they are characterized by a strong proliferative capacity, little effect of aging, and a small decrease in bone differentiation ability [173,174]. The number and growth of bone-marrow-derived MSCs decrease with age. Adipose-derived MSCs can grow sufficiently even if they are obtained from the adipose tissue of elderly individuals. General anesthesia is used to collect MSCs derived from the bone marrow, which puts a heavy burden on the patient. In contrast, when adipose-derived MSCs are collected, the burden on the patient is light because adipose tissue is close to the surface of the body. In addition, adipose-derived MSCs are characterized by a higher immunosuppressive capacity than that of bone-marrow-derived MSCs [175]. Animal studies have shown that adipose-derived MSCs can dramatically improve nephritis [176]. Moreover, MSCs accumulate at the treatment site because of the “homing phenomenon”, which includes MSCs recognizing the lesion-induced signals such as cytokines and adhesion factors. Therefore, when MSCs are injected into the blood circulation, they naturally accumulate at the desired site and exert a therapeutic effect. In particular, after intramuscular injection, MSCs deposit in the interstices of muscle fibers through the production of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and VEGF, and induce angiogenesis and support nerve cell regeneration, leading to amelioration of neuropathy [177,178,179]. These results suggest that MSCs are excellent for clinical use due to having a wide range of applications and sufficient supply, in addition to fewer safety-related and ethical issues. Allogenic MSCs are expected to have a wide range of therapeutic effects, and clinical trials are currently underway in various diseases, such as osteochondral disease, decompensated liver cirrhosis, systemic erythematosus, acute transplant-to-host disease, Crohn’s disease, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, and Parkinson’s disease [180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192]. In safety evaluation studies, mild-to-moderate abnormalities, such as fever, chills, headache, fatigue, increased anxiety, redness of administered skin, edema, weight loss, cold, and cough, were frequently observed, but no serious acute adverse events were reported even in elderly patients. Currently, regenerative medicinal products have been approved for the treatment of spinal cord injury and acute graft-versus-host disease after HSC transplantation. However, some issues still exist when using MSC for regenerative medicine.",
        "Since MSCs, compared with autologous cells, have a higher risk of transmitting infectious factors such as viruses to patients undergoing transplantation, it is necessary to exert stringent control on the quality of the cells used as raw materials [193]. Additionally, a risk of immune rejection and low engraftment compared with that in autologous cells has been suggested [194,195,196,197,198,199]. It can be pointed out that the risk of tumorigenicity may be low because the engraftment is lower than that of autologous cells, and the immune system is easily activated. However, as the cells are amplified, the risk of accumulation of genomic mutation and chromosomal abnormalities also increases [200]. Therefore, appropriate evaluation is a critical factor because the risk of tumorigenesis varies greatly depending on the culture, proliferation period of used cells, and number of cells to be transplanted. With allogeneic cells, it is assumed that a single cell strain will be transplanted into multiple patients. Therefore, it is relatively easy to standardize and manage the timing of the processing and shipping, which leads to reduced costs. However, the risk of an intravascular embolism when administered transvascularly has been previously reported for both autologous and allogeneic cells in clinical use [201]. In addition, as an allogeneic bone-marrow-derived MSC preparation, Temcel® HS injection has already been approved for regenerative medicine [202]. However, the results of nonclinical studies in rats showed cell embolism in the brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, bladder, etc., and thrombus in the lungs of some individuals [203]. Furthermore, the risk assessment in clinical studies did not rule out causality with the administered cells owing to one patient who died of gastrointestinal bleeding and one among 25 patients who exhibited a systemic rash after administration. However, no such adverse events have been confirmed in nonclinical studies to date. Another MSC product derived from allogeneic cord blood, CARTISTEM, is undergoing two clinical studies, including phase I/II and phase III, but no major adverse events have been reported yet [204].",
        "MSC is a mesoderm-derived somatic stem cell that can be established from tissues such as bone marrow, fat, umbilical cord, and pulp, and has the ability to differentiate into fat, bone, and cartilage [205,206]. In addition to this differentiation capacity, MSC exerts secretory effects that induce anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, or immunosuppressive effects. In recent years, it has been suggested that these effects are due to EVs secreted from bone marrow, fat, umbilical cord, menstruation blood, pulp, etc. [207,208,209,210]. MSC therapy is expected to be applied to various diseases including severe heart failure, but there are challenges such as individual differences and insufficient effects. Since T-cadherin, a receptor for adiponectin, is expressed in MSCs, it was revealed that adiponectin, which is secreted by adipocytes and is abundant in blood, promotes EVs production, thereby exerting a therapeutic effect on MSCs using a mouse model of heart failure (Figure 2) [211]. Thus, in MSC therapy, since the administrated MSCs produce a large amount of EVs by incorporating adiponectin into the cells via T-cadherin expressed on the membrane surface, the action of EVs on the heart improves the cardiac function of the heart failure model.",
        "Recent studies have shown that EVs secreted by MSCs have similar therapeutic effects on MSCs because some of the paracrine effects of MSCs are derived from exosomes, and most of the therapeutic effects of MSCs are responsible for the paracrine effects of EVs in certain diseases via miRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins as functional molecules [212,213,214,215].",
        "As for the therapeutic effect of EVs secreted by MSCs, first, studies using animals modeled for acute renal disease showed that MSCs acted paraclinically against living epithelial cells to support tissue regeneration, in which paracrine effect plays a vital role via EV-encapsulated mRNAs involved in transcriptional regulation, proliferation, and immune regulation to induce tissue regeneration [216,217,218]. Furthermore, the in vitro signaling pathway to induce apoptosis and suppress the proliferation of renal epithelial cells was inactivated in the presence of EVs released by MSCs, leading to protection against cellular damage [219,220,221]. However, since no such effect was observed in fibroblast-derived EVs, it was assumed that the cytoprotective action is a specific property of MSC-derived EVs. Additionally, MSCs, which are induced to differentiate from ES cells or established from various fetal tissues, MSC-derived EVs have been shown to have therapeutic effects on myocardial damage in a very short time in animal models with myocardial ischemia–reperfusion disorder [222,223]. This was achieved through the delivery of proteins retaining functionality within the EVs to cardiomyocytes efficiently and rapidly, leading to reduced oxidative stress and promoted phosphorylation of the PI3K/Akt pathway; where the equivalent therapeutic effect of the EVs was indicated as an amount of 1/10 or less of the EV-depleted supernatant from the MSC culture [224,225,226,227]. In addition, the increased expression of microRNAs secreted by MSCs had therapeutic effects via the secretion of neurotrophic factors and angiogenesis-promoting factors, and the EVs ameliorate neuropathy in stroke animal models through neurite outgrowth, where administration of MSC-derived EVs intravenously had the same effects as that of cell administration [228,229]. Furthermore, in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model, neutral endopeptidase (NEP), which is the enzyme responsible for the rate-determining process of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the brain of patients with this disorder and excessive accumulation of Aβ is one of the major characteristics of the pathophysiology of AD, was higher in adipose-derived MSCs than in bone-marrow-derived MSCs and contributed to the higher efficiency of Aβ degradation [230,231,232]. In addition, the NEP protein is also present in EVs from adipose-derived MSCs and exhibits enzymatic activity, leading to intracellular Aβ degradation via uptake by neural cells [233]. Moreover, in a mouse model of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, MSC-derived EVs exerted therapeutic effects by suppressing inflammation through the inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway in the lung [234]. Here, the EVs suppressed the upregulation of the hypoxia-inducible miR-17 superfamily and induced the upregulation of the growth-inhibitory miR-204, and no therapeutic effects were observed in the EV-depleted supernatant. Additionally, in a mouse model of acute lung injury, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) mRNA, which is important for the therapeutic effect of EVs on lung disorders due to its abundance within the EVs and the paracrine effect of MSCs, is partially responsible for the healing effect on lung injury [235]. In addition, the administration of MSCs into the lungs of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury mice restored the proliferative capacity of alveolar epithelial cells and lung function through mitochondrial transmission [236]. Further, MSC-derived EVs have been reported to have opposite effects, i.e., tumor progression via tumor microenvironment remodeling and tumor suppression via regulation of immune responses and intercellular signaling. However, it has been suggested that they will be safe carriers of antitumor drugs [237,238,239].",
        "Thus, although substantial evidence is available on the usefulness of the therapeutic effects of MSC-derived EVs, some important challenges remain. The basic molecular mechanisms of EVs, such as secretion, uptake by the receiving cell, sorting of their contents, and biogenesis, are still unclear. Various regulatory molecules in multiple molecular pathways have been identified as the mechanism of EV synthesis and secretion [240,241,242,243,244]. These pathways include the endosomal-sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) involved in membrane vesicle formation, neutral sphingomyelinase 2/sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (nSMase2/Smpd3) that is the rate-determining enzyme for a membrane component ceramide synthesis, members of the Rab GTPase family involved in intracellular membrane vesicle transport, and heparanase that is a heparan sulfate degrading enzyme [245,246,247,248]. However, the degree of contribution of these regulatory molecules to EV biogenesis and secretion pathways varies greatly depending on the cell type. Therefore, to investigate the function of EVs in a cell, it is difficult to predict which pathways or molecules should be suppressed, even if an attempt is made to inhibit the secretion of EVs in target cells. Little is known about the mechanism of EV uptake into cells by the nonimmune cell system, except for the uptake of EVs in immune cells by phagocytosis. Another challenge is the unification of experimental techniques in EV research, especially in the isolation of EVs, including the most common techniques ultracentrifugation, separation based on molecular size via gel chromatography, and extraction reagents, which is the root of this research. It is unclear whether the EV fractions recovered by using different isolation methods show bioequivalence.",
        "When considering the prospects for treatment strategies using MSC-derived EVs, first, a stable supply of MSC-derived EVs is necessary to identify suitable molecular pathways and appropriate management techniques to increase the yield of MSC-derived EVs while retaining their original therapeutic effects. Second, ensuring sufficient capacity for clinical application, if the therapeutic effect of MSC-derived EVs can be amplified, the therapeutic applicability will be greatly increased. A possible method to resolve this issue is to overexpress therapeutic molecules, such as mRNAs, miRNAs, or proteins, in MSC-derived EVs and produce a large number of EVs encapsulating these molecules. In fact, it has been shown that cells overexpressing certain miRNAs secrete EVs containing abundant miRNAs [249,250,251]. In addition, an approach that completely improves the therapeutic effect of MSC-derived EVs would be to produce a large number of EVs containing an excess of molecules by inducing a specific stimulus to the MSCs with the target therapeutic effects. Third, DDS techniques need to be developed to specifically deliver the MSC-derived EVs to target tissues. Since MSC-derived EVs have not been characterized completely, there is an unexpected risk from systemic administration via the intravenous route. For example, given that MSC-derived EVs can promote the repair of damaged tissues, the risk of carcinogenesis due to delivery to nontarget tissues cannot be ruled out. At present, modification of the surface of EVs seems promising for tissue-specific DDS through the expression of receptor proteins that exhibit tissue-specific expression using genetic recombination technology [252,253]. Thus, a new DDS with high specificity and delivery efficiency can be developed using MSC-derived EVs to introduce functional molecules with therapeutic effects. In contrast, since the complete biological action of EVs is not completely understood yet, the risk of side effects is a major concern. Bone-marrow-derived EVs induce dormancy of tumor cells and are involved in long-term recurrence, while EV-encapsulated miRNAs secreted by tumor cells cause intratumoral angiogenesis and promote metastasis in the brain through disruption of the blood–brain barrier [254,255,256].",
        "More than 500 clinical research on MSC is underway in the world for various target diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn’s disease, myocardial infarction, Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injury, osteoarthritis, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266]. MSCs other than those derived from bone marrow are also being clinically applied. Physician-led clinical trials such as amniotic-membrane- or umbilical-cord-derived MSC treatments for Crohn’s disease or acute GVHD are underway. In addition, a study of the induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived MSCs for acute GVHD has begun. Further, bone-marrow-derived MSC Temcel® indication expanded to epidermolysis bullosa. Additionally, a clinical trial has begun in which pulp-derived MSCs are administrated for acute cerebral infarction. Since MSCs are slightly different in nature depending on the organization from which they are sourced, it is important to select a cell source suitable for specific diseases and therapeutic effects. Moreover, it has been clarified that the secreted EV plays an important role when MSC exerts various actions. Additionally, it has also been reported that administration of EVs secreted by cultured bone-marrow-derived MSC to patients with refractory GVHD resulted in improvement in symptoms. Furthermore, clinical trials of MSC-derived exosomes are currently underway for diabetes mellitus type 1, cerebrovascular disorders, coronavirus, Alzheimer's disease, and osteoarthritis (Table 1).",
        "MSC-derived EVs treated with the cytokines upregulate the expression of the immunomodulatory molecules, including miRNAs and proteins, involved in the immunoregulatory pathways. This plays an important role in tissue repair of chronic damage through the concentration of active ingredients in the contents and efficient migration of the macrophages incorporated in the MSC-derived EVs to the damage site due to the removal of dead cells and improvement of fibrosis. These therapeutic effects are equal to or higher than those of the MSCs themselves. These reports suggest that the administration of MSC-derived EVs is a useful novel cell-free therapeutic strategy.",

        "The incidence of alveolar and maxillofacial bone defects caused by trauma, tumor and inflammation is high, and such pathological bone defects often lead to biomechanical stability and functional reconstruction of conventional restorations and implant-supported prosthetic solutions (Visscher et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2022). In this context, revolutionary advances in bone tissue engineering technologies are providing breakthrough solutions for the regenerative repair of bone defects. Guided bone regeneration (GBR) biomaterials can significantly improve the effectiveness of structural and functional reconstruction of critical-sized bone defects (Urban and Monje, 2019). The core principle of GBR is to create a physical barrier between the bone defect area and the soft tissue by using a biological barrier membrane that selectively inhibits the infiltration of fibrous connective tissue and epithelial cells based on a spatial competition mechanism, while creating a preferential microenvironment for the proliferation of osteogenic progenitor cells. The barrier membrane maintains the stability of the clot and the morphology of the defect area through mechanical isolation and relieves pressure on the soft tissues, thereby supporting the process of directed migration, differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts (Laney, 2017; Sheikh et al., 2017).",
        "Currently, GBR membranes are mainly divided into non-resorbable and resorbable materials. Although polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is clinically effective as a non-resorbable membrane, its non-resorbability requires secondary surgical removal, which significantly increases the risk of postoperative infection and limits its clinical use (Carbonell et al., 2014; Garcia et al., 2018; Trobos et al., 2018). In contrast, resorbable collagen (Col) membranes, with their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and natural bioactivity, have become an important alternative in bone augmentation therapy, promoting bone repair through tissue regeneration mechanisms while avoiding secondary surgery (Dimitriou et al., 2012; Liu and Kerns, 2014). However, the poor mechanical properties and rapid degradation behavior of collagen membranes have hindered their development, as they are unable to maintain their spatial configuration (Garcia et al., 2017; Rothamel et al., 2005). Micro- and nanoscale fiber structures produced by electrospinning technology have been widely used in the development of GBR membranes due to their highly biomimetic properties. These structures can mimic the topological characteristics of the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) and effectively promote cell adhesion, proliferation and metabolic exchange, while the micro-barrier formed by the nanofiber network can selectively block the invasion of fibrous connective tissue and ensure the stability of the osteogenic microenvironment in the bone defect region. However, these electrostatically spun GBR membranes have not yet been clinically translated (Martins et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2013). Therefore, the development of GBR membranes with good mechanical properties, degradation rate, osteoinductive activity and antimicrobial functionality required to withstand the multidimensional effects of mechanical stress, microbial colonization and biomolecular metabolism in the dynamic oral cavity bioenvironment is a core research direction.",
        "Col, a core component of connective tissue, is widely used in biomaterial design due to its low immunogenicity, biodegradability and structural support function (Ren et al., 2022). Poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), an FDA-approved biodegradable polyester, has proven to be the preferred substrate for bone tissue engineering scaffolds due to its combination of excellent mechanical strength and histocompatibility (Brown et al., 2018). Based on this, this study aims to improve the interfacial compatibility and mechanical stability of electrostatically spun fiber membranes through intermolecular interactions by the composite of Col and PLGA (Ahi et al., 2020; Kwak et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018). Prior research shows that PLGA/Col composite systems have been validated in the field of nerve axon guidance scaffolds, brain injury repair carriers and bone defect filling materials (Park et al., 2018). However, the composite system still suffers from significant functional deficiencies in terms of osteoinductive differentiation efficiency and antimicrobial activity in guided bone regeneration membrane applications.",
        "The dual role of bioactive ions in tissue repair and bacterial resistance modulation is gradually becoming a research focus. Zinc, an essential trace element, plays a key biological function by regulating osteoblast differentiation, matrix mineralization and maintenance of bone homeostasis (Yamaguchi and Weitzmann, 2011). In addition, its antimicrobial activity has been widely demonstrated (Nagata and Lonnerdal, 2011). However, excessive zinc ions have the potential to cause toxicity and to inhibit the expression of bone-related genes. Therefore, a controlled slow-release system is required to achieve zinc ion delivery (Giliopoulos et al., 2020; Yang and Yang, 2020). Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials self-assembled by coordination between organic ligands and metal ions, among which zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is composed of zinc ions coordinated with dimethylimidazole, which combines excellent biocompatibility and osteoinductive properties (Pan et al., 2011). The material exhibits stability in neutral environments, yet rapidly dissociates under acidic conditions, thereby facilitating the prompt release of Zn2+ in bacterial infection microenvironments (Sun et al., 2012). It has been demonstrated that nano ZIF-8 activates the MAPK signaling pathway in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells through the process of endocytosis, thereby significantly promoting osteogenic differentiation (Gao et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2016). Therefore, ZIF-8 nanoparticles can be introduced into GBR membranes as antimicrobial-osteogenic functional modification materials to achieve the membrane material to play a precise regulatory role of antimicrobial and osteogenic in the process of bone repair.",
        "In this study, a novel PLGA/Col/ZIF-8 composite nanofibrous membrane was fabricated by electrospinning technology for bone defect repair. Initially, a mechanically adapted substrate was constructed by means of gradient doping Col in a PLGA matrix, followed by the subsequent integration of ZIF-8 into PLGA/Col to achieve a microenvironment-triggered release mechanism of zinc ions, thereby resulting in both antimicrobial and osteogenic effects. Furthermore, a rat cranial defect model was utilized to confirm its capacity to repair bone tissue defects in vivo, thereby assessing the potential of this composite fibrous membrane in bone regeneration strategies.",
        "Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA; LA/GA = 75:25, Mw = 66–107 kDa) was procured from Sigma Aldrich. Type I collagen (Col I) was obtained from Macklin, while 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) and 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM) were sourced from Aladdin. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate was procured from Innochem. All of the aforementioned chemical reagents were of analytical grade and did not undergo any further purification.",
        "The synthesis and characterization of the ZIF-8 nanoparticles were conducted in accordance with the following procedure (Supplementary Figures S1, S2). The electrospun solution was prepared by dissolving PLGA in HFIP (20% w/v) under magnetic stirring at room temperature. To prepare the PLGA/Col electrospun solution, 1 g of PLGA was dissolved in 5 mL of HFIP. Subsequently, the different weight ratios of Col/PLGA (1:100, 3:100, 5:100 and 10:100; abbreviated as PC1, PC3, PC5 and PC10, respectively) were added under stirring until complete dissolution. The electrospun solution of PLGA/Col/ZIF-8 was prepared in the following manner: ZIF-8 at varying weight ratios (0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 1.5 wt% and 2 wt%; designated as PC3Z0.5, PC3Z1, PC3Z1.5 and PC3Z2, respectively) was subjected to sonication and dispersion in 5 mL HFIP. Subsequently, 1 g of PLGA and 0.03 g of Col I were added to the solution, which was then magnetically stirred until complete dissolution of the PLGA and Col I had occurred. The solution was then sonicated for a further 0.5 h to ensure uniform dispersion of the nano-ZIF-8 within the spinning solution. The electrospun solutions were introduced into the system via a 23 G flat-tipped needle at a constant injection rate of 0.5 mL/h, using a plastic syringe. The distance between the needle and the flat collector was 15 cm, the applied positive voltage was 10–15 kV, and the humidity was approximately 21%–31%.",
        "The microscopic morphology of the membranes was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Gemini 560, ZEISS, Germany). The chemical compositions of the membranes were established through the use of a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR, Nicolet iS5, Thermo, United States). Moreover, Nano Measurer was employed to quantify the diameter and distribution of the membranes from the acquired SEM image. The presence of ZIF-8 crystals in the membranes was confirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD, X’PERT, Panalytical, Holland). Thermogravimetric analysis (TG, STA449F3, NETZSCH, Germany) was employed to ascertain the thermal stability of the membranes. All samples were subjected to a heating process, increasing the temperature from 30°C to 500°C at a rate of 10°C/min, in a nitrogen-enriched environment. The wettability of the membranes (n = 3) was evaluated using a contact angle meter (SDC 350, SINDIN, China). In order to evaluate the impact of Col and ZIF-8 NPs incorporation on the mechanical properties of the membranes (n = 3), an electronic universal testing machine (Model 6103, MTS, China) with a 50 N load cell was employed to conduct a series of tests on the membranes under dry and wet condition (soaking in deionized water for 24 h), which had overall dimensions of 50 mm × 10 mm × 0.2 mm. The crosshead speed was set at 15 mm/min. For degradation test, membrane samples (n = 3) were precisely sectioned into 10 mm × 10 mm squares. Initial dry mass (W0) was determined using an analytical balance. Specimens were subsequently immersed in 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37°C. The PBS was replenished weekly to maintain ionic stability. The samples were removed at each predetermined time point, at days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 56, and then placed in a vacuum drying oven until completely dry and weighed (Wt). Weight loss (%) = (W0 - Wt)/W0 × 100. The release of zinc ions from the composite membranes (n = 3) was quantified using inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, iCAP 7,400, Thermo, United States). The membranes were immersed in PBS with a specified pH value (pH 7.4) for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days at 37°C without agitation, the extracts were collected at various time points and the amount of released Zn2+ ions was measured.",
        "The mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were procured from Immocell Biotechnology.

The osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was induced using an osteogenic induction medium (OriCell, China). All cells were cultured in accordance with standard conditions (37°C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity).

        "In order to prepare PCZ composite fibrous membranes with both excellent mechanical properties and good cytocompatibility, different contents of Col and ZIF-8 were added to the PLGA fibrous membranes (the optimization process is illustrated in Supplementary Figures S3, S4, and the PCZ composite fibrous membranes with the optimal performance were selected for subsequent analysis.",
        "The morphology of the membrane is illustrated in Figures 1A,B,D, where the fiber exhibit random orientation and form an interconnected porous structure. The P membranes exhibited an average fiber diameter of 1,301 ± 312 nm, demonstrating homogeneous morphological characteristics with smooth surfaces devoid of bead-like or spindle-shaped structural defects. Increasing Col content from 1% to 15% induced a progressive fiber diameter reduction from 1,057 ± 272 nm to 451 ± 80 nm in PC membranes. This inverse correlation originated from collagen’s viscosity-lowering effect on the electrospinning solution, thereby decreasing the mean fiber dimensions (Lee et al., 2009). Supplementary Figure S3 demonstrates a biphasic tensile strength response to elevated Col concentrations in the membranes. The PC3 formulation, corresponding to the tensile strength maximum, was subjected to subsequent ZIF-8 parametric analysis to optimize mechanical performance. A moderate increase in Col content can enhance the tensile properties of the material by optimizing the fiber network structure through intermolecular cross-linking; beyond the critical concentration, excess collagen triggers phase separation or crystallization defects, leading to stress concentration and reduced mechanical strength.",

        "To determine the optimal ZIF-8 NPs loading, PC3 fibers were modified with four ZIF-8 NPs weight fractions (0.5-2 wt%). Supplementary Figure S4 demonstrated maximal proliferative activity at 1 wt% ZIF-8 on days 3/5, establishing this concentration for PCZ membrane fabrication. As shown in Figure 1D, the doping of ZIF-8 NPs led to a further decrease in the average diameter of fibers in the PCZ membrane. This originated from ZIF-8-induced viscosity reduction in the spinning solution. The initial 10 kV voltage insufficiently countered surface tension, causing droplet ejection, necessitating voltage elevation to 15 kV for stabilized fiber formation. Furthermore, EDS analysis demonstrated the presence of C, N, O and Zn, thereby further indicating the presence of ZIF-8 NPs in the nanofibers (Figure 1C). Therefore, Pure PLGA (P), PC3 (PC), and PC3Z1 (PCZ) membranes were prioritized for detailed investigation in this study.",
        "As shown in Figure 2A, the XRD analysis of the fibrous membrane revealed that pure PLGA and Col belong to the amorphous structure, presenting only one broad peak. The incorporation of Col resulted in the diffusion and broadening of the peaks corresponding to PC and PCZ. This phenomenon may be attributed to the interaction between PLGA and Col molecules, which impedes the arrangement of PLGA chains. The XRD pattern of PCZ exhibited distinctive peaks at 7.07°, 10.03°, 12.30°, 14.32°, 16.01° and 17.64°. These peaks correspond to the ZIF-8 crystal face at (011), (002), (112), (022), (013) and (222), which indicates the presence of ZIF-8 dispersion within the nanofibers. The FTIR spectra (Figure 2B) revealed that the PLGA, PLGA/Col, and PLGA/Col/ZIF-8 exhibited stretching bands of C=O and C-O at 1752 cm−1 and 1,083 cm−1, respectively, which corresponded to the characteristic peaks of PLGA. The absorption peaks of am-ide I and amide II in Col were observed at 1,657 cm−1 and 1,529 cm−1, respectively. The absorption peaks of PLGA/Col and PLGA/Col/ZIF-8 exhibited slight shifts towards lower wavelengths, appearing at 1,644 cm−1 and 1,526 cm−1, respectively. This suggests that the amino group in Col most likely formed hydrogen bonds with the PLGA molecular chain. Additionally, PLGA/Col/ZIF-8 displayed a Zn-N stretching vibration at 427 cm−1.",

(H) Cumulative Zn2+ release from the PCZ nanofibers. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).",
        "The thermal analysis of the fibrous membrane is illustrated in Figures 2C,D. The TG curve with a first-order derivative demonstrates that the fastest thermal decomposition temperature of PLGA is 356°C, while the fastest thermal decomposition temperatures of Col and ZIF-8 are 350°C and 270°C, respectively. It can be concluded that the introduction of Col and ZIF-8 resulted in a reduction of the fastest thermal decomposition temperature of the membranes, while still meeting the thermal stability requirements of GBR membranes. The initial stage of mass loss can be attributed to the evaporation of physically adsorbed water, while the subsequent stage may be attributed to the collapse of the molecular chain structure and thermal decomposition. As displayed in Figure 2E, the PLGA membrane exhibited hydrophobic behavior, with a water contact angle of 100.43°. The incorporation of Col markedly enhanced the hydrophilicity of the membrane, reducing the surface contact angle of the material to 90.97°. This was predominantly attributed to the hydrophilic nature of the amino and carboxyl functional groups of Col. The contact angle of PCZ was 104.27°.",
        "The mechanical strength of a material is also an important performance indicator. Accordingly, the objective of this experiment was to evaluate the mechanical properties of various membranes through a tensile strength test. As demonstrated in Figure 2F, the tensile strength of the pure P membrane in the dry state was found to be 3.52 ± 0.58 MPa. In contrast, the tensile strength of the PC composite membrane and the PCZ composite membrane was significantly higher, reaching approximately 2.5 and 2 times that of the pure P membrane, respectively. It is important to acknowledge the considerable impact of ambient humidity on the mechanical properties of materials. While the pure P membrane exhibited only 7% strength attenuation under wet conditions, the tensile strength of the PC and PCZ composite membrane decreased sharply by 52% and 75%, respectively. Specifically, the tensile strength of the PCZ membrane was measured at 7.37 ± 0.63 MPa in the dry condition, which decreased to 1.87 ± 0.14 MPa after 24 h of water immersion. A comparison with commercially available products demonstrated that the tensile strength of the Bio-Gide resorbable barrier membrane in the dry/wet state was 4.6 ± 0.94 MPa versus 1.68 ± 0.54 MPa, respectively (Raz et al., 2019). This comparison demonstrates that the mechanical properties of PCZ membranes in the wet state are still superior to those of clinically available products, which is crucial for guided bone regeneration applications.",
        "Studies have indicated that the diameter of electrospun fibers critically influences their mechanical properties, with reduced diameters typically accompanied by enhanced strength and reduced ductility (Stachewicz et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2005). The introduction of col significantly decreased fiber diameter (Figure 1), thereby enhancing the mechanical strength of the composites. This improvement stems from two aspects. Firstly, active groups such as amino/carboxyl groups in col molecules form intermolecular hydrogen-bonding networks with PLGA, which stabilize molecular conformations and enhance macroscopic mechanical performance. As previously mentioned, XRD and FTIR results partially support this perspective. Secondly, the incorporation of ZIF-8 nanoparticles may cause disordering of polymer chain arrangements and particle agglomeration phenomena, resulting in slightly lower tensile strength in the PCZ group compared to the PC group. Nevertheless, the overall tensile performance of PCZ membranes remains significantly superior to that of pure PLGA membranes and fully meets the mechanical strength requirements for GBR applications.",
        "In order to evaluate the in vitro degradability of the prepared membranes, the mass loss during their immersion was detected. As demonstrated in Figure 2G, the mass loss rate of PCZ was marginally higher than that of PC. However, the degradation kinetic curves of these two samples exhibited analogous trends. The experimental data demonstrated that the degradation rate of the pure PLGA material was significantly lower than that of the other fibrous membranes at all the detected time nodes, thereby confirming that the addition of Col changes the material properties and significantly accelerates the degradation process of the composite fibers. This phenomenon can be attributed to the formation of continuous structural defects within the composite material due to the rapid degradation of Col. This, in turn, facilitates the penetration of hydrolysis media by increasing the contact surface between the fibrous membrane and the soaking solution. Furthermore, the progressive dissolution and release of ZIF-8 NPs from the PCZ fiber membrane occurred with the extension of the degradation time, which further led to a slightly faster degradation rate of the PCZ than that of the PC membrane. Subsequently, the release behavior of Zn2+ from PCZ nanofibrous membranes was evaluated. As shown in Figure 2H, under simulated physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37°C), the Zn2+ release profile exhibits a typical two-stage pattern: an initial burst release occurs within the first 24 h (cumulative release: 0.77 ± 0.05 μg/mL), followed by a sustained-release phase, reaching a cumulative concentration of 1.26 ± 0.06 μg/mL by day 7. Notably, this release amount is significantly lower than the internationally recognized safe threshold range for zinc ions (0.65–16.25 ppm) (Nagata and Lönnerdal, 2011). Studies have shown that zinc-based sustained-release materials generally exhibit an initial rapid release (1–7 days) followed by exponential decay, rather than a linear accumulation trend (Xue et al., 2021). With regard to the toxicity threshold, it has been confirmed in vitro that ZIF-8 concentrations less than 50 μg/mL possess anti-apoptotic properties and improve cell survival (Gao et al., 2021). Importantly, the peak release level of this system at 7 days was only 2.5% of that safety threshold, further corroborating its safety advantage.",
        "Cell-material interactions initiate with attachment, potentially progressing to adhesion, followed by proliferation and spreading phases (Anselme, 2000). BMSCs cultured on the surface of fibrous membranes exhibited proliferation behaviors quantified via CCK-8 assay. Enhanced proliferative capacity, a cornerstone of cellular physiology, directly supports differentiation potential in biomaterial interfaces. Figure 3A indicated that the proliferation of cells on the fibrous membranes exhibited an overall increasing trend over time. There was no statistically significant difference in cell proliferation between the groups on days 1 and 3, indicating that the fibrous membranes exhibited good biocompatibility. The proliferation of BMSCs was significantly enhanced by PCZ nanofiber membranes compared to the P and PC groups on day 5. The enhanced cell proliferation capacity may be attributed to the release of zinc ions at optimal concentrations, which facilitated the proliferation of BMSCs (Yusa et al., 2011). Furthermore, cell adhesion and nutrient exchange on membranes is found to be highly correlated with fiber diameter, morphology and pore size (Zhou et al., 2015). Previous studies have shown that the number of cells adhering to nanofibers is greater than that adhering to microfibers.",

        "Live/dead staining revealed cell viability on fibrous membranes (Figure 3B). Following 24 h culture, all groups exhibited predominantly viable cells (green) with minimal red fluorescence (dead cells), confirming the material was not significantly toxic to the cells. Given the critical role of cell adhesion in proliferation and differentiation, this study assessed the impact of fibrous membranes on the adhesion behavior and morphological spreading of BMSCs by means of a cytoskeleton-specific staining technique. Dual-channel fluorescent labeling (phalloidin for F-actin, red; DAPI for nuclei, blue) was employed (Figure 3C). After 24 h incubation, a certain number of BMSCs were observed to be adhered to the surface of the P, PC and PCZ membranes. It was evident that the incorporation of ZIF-8 NPs had a significant impact on the spreading area of the cells within the material. The cells exhibited a characteristic polygonal morphology, accompanied by filamentous pseudopod extension features, suggesting that the cells had established stable extracellular matrix interactions. It was further demonstrated that PCZ fibrous membranes would construct a growth-promoting microenvironment via strengthened cell-matrix interactions.",
        "As a characteristic biomarker of early stages of osteogenic differentiation, ALP expression levels were used to systematically assess the effect of nanofibrous membranes on the efficacy of early osteogenic induction in BMSCs (Ren et al., 2021). ALP staining (Figures 4A,B) and quantitative analysis of ALP activity (Figures 4D,E) demonstrated that following a 7-day and 14-day culture period, cells in all groups showed the phenomenon of violet-blue precipitate deposition, with the PCZ group showing the densest staining areas and the deepest staining intensity due to synergistic effect of ZIF-8 NPs. The PC group demonstrated significantly higher staining intensity and activity at 14 days (P < 0.01) in comparison to the P group. However, no statistical difference was observed between the two groups at 7 days (P > 0.05). Quantitative analysis further demonstrated that ALP activity in the PCZ group increased in a time-dependent manner, and its 14-day activity value was elevated approximately 1.6-fold in comparison with that of the P group (P < 0.001). The results indicated that ZIF-8 NPs significantly strengthened the early osteogenic differentiation ability of PCZ composite fibrous membranes by regulating osteogenesis-related signaling pathways.",

        "The capacity of the extracellular matrix to mineralize was systematically assessed by means of ARS calcium nodule staining. This is a key morphological marker of advanced osteogenic differentiation (Sculean et al., 2008). Following a 21-day incubation period, the presence of orange mineralized nodule deposition was observed in all groups (Figure 4C). The PCZ group demonstrated the highest mineralization density and strongest staining intensity, followed by the PC group. In contrast, the P group exhibited the lightest staining and the lowest number of calcium nodules. The results of the semi-quantitative analysis conducted by ARS (Figure 4F) demonstrated a consistent trend with staining, with significantly higher OD values observed in the PCZ group compared to the PC group (P < 0.01) and the P group (P < 0.001). The results obtained above demonstrate that the prepared PCZ composite fiber membrane has the capacity to promote extracellular matrix mineralization and calcium deposition.",
        "In the aftermath of GBR, the regenerative outcome of hard and soft tissues is subject to the influence of bacterial colonization and infection (Wang et al., 2020). The introduction of antimicrobial components has been demonstrated to be efficacious in the prevention of infection, as well as in the reduction of inflammation (Brown et al., 2018). In the context of bacterial research, E. coli (Gram-negative bacteria) and S. aureus (Gram-positive bacteria) have been selected as models to assess the antimicrobial capacity of PCZ nanofiber membranes.",
        "As demonstrated in Figure 5A, the antibacterial properties of distinct fiber membranes were examined through agar plate counting. In comparison to P and PC, PCZ nanofiber membrane exhibited substantial bacterial inhibition, evidenced by a substantial decrease in the number of bacterial colonies following 12 h of inoculation with E. coli and S. aureus (Figure 5B). Moreover, OD values of bacterial strains co-cultured with the fiber membranes were investigated. As depicted in Figures 5C,D, after 12 h of co-incubation, the OD value of the P showed no significant difference compared to that of the PC, indicating that Col contributes minimally to the antibacterial activity of the PC membrane. In contrast, the OD values for E. coli and S. aureus in the PCZ were substantially lower than those in the P and PC. This demonstrates a significantly enhanced antibacterial effect, further confirming that the Zn2+ released from the PCZ fiber membrane demonstrates certain inhibitory activity against E. coli and S. aureus.",

        "Membrane materials have been shown to carry a high risk of infection during the initial week following implantation. To prevent further bacterial colonization, it is essential to ensure a sustained release of Zn2+ (Xue et al., 2014). ZIF-8 nanoparticles, derived from PCZ nanofiber membranes, have been demonstrated to be effective in preventing bacterial colonization, with a sustained release capacity of at least 7 days (Figure 2F). This property is crucial in the early stages of bacterial colonization, where it can play a pivotal role in preventing the establishment of bacterial communities (Wu, B. et al., 2019).",
        "The study evaluated the efficacy of PCZ nanofiber membranes on bone tissue regeneration in a rat cranial defect model (diameter: 5 mm). Three types of membrane materials, P, PC and PCZ membranes, were tested in parallel and the results were compared with a “no membrane control” group (Figure 6A). The rats were euthanized 4 weeks after surgery, and the cranial defects were collected and assessed for bone regeneration by Micro-CT and histological analysis.",

Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 5, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).",
        "A reconstructed Micro-CT scan image is presented in Figure 6A, showing newly formed bone within the defect at 4 weeks postoperatively. The 3D reconstructed image demonstrated a significant increase in bone regeneration in the defect treated with PCZ fibrous membrane. Specifically, a significant increase in bone volume to tissue volume (BV/TV) was observed in the PCZ fiber membrane treated site compared to the untreated site and the other fiber membrane treated sites (P < 0.01) (Figure 6B).",
        "Moreover, the results of H&E staining further validated the results of the Micro-CT analysis. As demonstrated in Figure 6C, in the blank control group, connective tissue occupied the majority of the bone defect area, with only a minimal amount of new bone formation observable at the edges. Observations revealed the presence of new bone formation on the inner face of the fibrous membrane material in all three groups (P, PC and PCZ). The study demonstrated that the osteoconductive ability of the membrane was indicated by the growth of new bone from the edge of the defect. A significant number of osteoblasts could be seen surrounding the bone defect area in the PCZ group, indicating a promising bone regeneration ability. Furthermore, new bone was discovered beneath the membrane, predominantly originating from its base. This phenomenon can be attributed to the presence of stem cells beneath the dura matter, a characteristic commonly observed in models of cranial defects. For histological assessment of visceral organs, examination of critical organs (heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys) via H&E staining revealed no significant toxicity or injury (Supplementary Figure S5A). Additionally, in the blood biochemical tests, no abnormalities were detected in WBC, RBC, HGB, PLT, AST, ALT, UREA, or CREA at day 3 (Supplementary Figure S5B). The implanted membranes demonstrated neither hematological nor organ toxicity, providing critical evidence supporting their biological applications. This study has limitations in detecting inflammatory indicators; future research must further examine the pathological manifestations of inflammatory responses.",
        "While this study confirms the macroscopic efficacy of composite materials in promoting bone regeneration through multi-scale characterization, the following limitations must be acknowledged. First, the molecular regulatory mechanisms by which the material mediates bone repair remain incompletely elucidated. Second, although electrospinning technology successfully constructed a biomimetic nanofiber scaffold, scalable production remains constrained by the low throughput of single-nozzle spinning and its sensitivity to processing parameters. Furthermore, this study focused on the early stage of bone repair, primarily monitoring the 7-day Zn2+ release kinetics, but the risk of Zn2+ accumulation during the later degradation phase and its coupling effect with new bone remodeling rates require further validation through long-term experiments. To address these issues, subsequent investigations will build upon previous signal transduction pathway research to examine whether canonical osteogenic signaling pathways participate in PCZ-induced BMSCs osteogenic differentiation. Simultaneously, the in vivo observation period will be prolonged to 12 weeks to further evaluate the spatiotemporal matching between material degradation and bone functional reconstruction, thereby facilitating the material’s advancement toward clinical translation.",
        "In this study, a novel Col and ZIF-8 reinforced PLGA fiber-guided bone regeneration membrane was successfully prepared by electrospinning. The incorporation of Col into the PLGA-based membranes resulted in a substantial enhancement of their mechanical strength, while the addition of ZIF-8 nanoparticles facilitated the sustained release of zinc ions from the fibrous membranes. The incorporation of ZIF-8 and Col enhanced the cytocompatibility of PLGA membranes to BMSCs; notably, doped ZIF-8 considerably promoted osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. PCZ fibrous membranes have been demonstrated to provide a basic microenvironment for osteoblasts and have been shown to promote bone defect repair in a rat cranial defect model. Therefore, it is considered that electrostatically spun PCZ fiber membranes are potential candidates for guided bone tissue regeneration applications.",

    "title": "Nanomedicine and drug delivery systems in cancer and regenerative medicine. medicine, facilitating better treatments than conventional drugs. Nanomedicine is being increasingly used to develop new methods of cancer diagnosis and treatment, since this technology can modulate the biodistribution and the target site accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs, thereby reducing their toxicity. Regenerative medicine provides another area where innovative drug delivery technology is being studied for improved tissue regeneration. Drug delivery systems can protect therapeutic proteins and peptides against degradation in biological environments and deliver them in a controlled manner. Similarly, the combination of drug delivery systems and stem cells can improve their survival, differentiation, and engraftment. The present review summarizes the most important steps carried-out by the group of Prof Blanco-Prieto in nanomedicine and drug delivery technologies. Throughout her scientific career, she has contributed to the area of nanomedicine to improve anticancer therapy. In particular, nanoparticles loaded with edelfosine, doxorubicin, or methotrexate have demonstrated great anticancer activity in preclinical settings of lymphoma, glioma, and pediatric osteosarcoma. In regenerative medicine, a major focus has been the development of drug delivery systems for brain and cardiac repair. In this context, several microparticle-based technologies loaded with biologics have demonstrated efficacy in clinically relevant animal models such as monkeys and pigs. The latest research by this group has shown that drug delivery systems combined with cell therapy can achieve a more complete and potent regenerative response. Cutting-edge areas such as noninvasive intravenous delivery of cardioprotective nanomedicines or extracellular vesicle-based therapies are also being explored.

      "title": "Quercetin combined with shTERT induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer via the P53/Bax pathway, and RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT nanoparticles enhance the therapeutic efficacy",
      "abstract": "Background Ovarian cancer (OC) is a highly malignant gynecological tumor with poor current treatment effects. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is an important component of telomerase and plays an important role in the progression of ovarian cancer. Quercetin(QR) has been shown to inhibit the cell cycle and induce the apoptosis in various types of tumors. However, the mechanism of quercetin in ovarian cancer and whether it can be applied in the treatment of ovarian cancer has not been fully understood. Results OC cells were intervened with QR in vitro and it was found that QR only inhibited the cell cycle but not induced cell apoptosis. By conducting network pharmacology, proteomics and TCGA-OV database analysis, we found that QR inhibited the cell cycle by binding to P53 and P21. However, in this study, overexpressed TERT in OC could bind to P53 and inhibit the binding of QR to P53, failing to induce tumor cell apoptosis. After TERT was knocked down, QR significantly suppressed the cell cycle of OC cells and induced apoptosis.To realize high drug delivery efficiency and drug targeting to improve the effect of inhibiting OC, we designed and prepared RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT nanoparticles for the combined administration of QR and shTERT. As confirmed by the in vivo experiments, RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT possessed good targeting ability and significant OC inhibiting effect, with no adverse reactions, and improved the survival benefits. Conclusions This study demonstrated the mechanistic and therapeutic advantages of combining QR with shTERT in the treatment of OC. Based on this mechanism, we synthesized the novel nanoparticles (RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT) and verified the favorable OC inhibiting effect in vivo, providing a novel strategy for the treatment of OC.

        "The morbidity and mortality of ovarian cancer (OC), as a highly malignant tumor in the female reproductive system, show a continuously increasing trend, posing a major challenge to women’s health [1]. At present, the only confirmed effective treatment options for OC are surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy [2]. However, more than half of OC patients still develop disease recurrence after treatment [3]. With the deepening of research, more and more natural compounds have been proven to have inhibitory effects on human cancer cells [4]. Compared with conventional chemotherapy, these natural compounds have fewer side effects, yet they are still associated with problems such as mediocre efficacy, poor targeting and low bioavailability [5]. Therefore, intensively exploring the molecular mechanism of natural compounds against cancer and attempting to overcome the above limitations may be an extremely promising treatment strategy for OC.",
        "Flavonoids are widely distributed in plants [6] and play an important role in the body's defense system. Quercetin is a natural polyphenolic flavonoid commonly found in a variety of fruits and vegetables, with the most important property being its antioxidant effect. In addition, quercetin can also be used for tumor prevention [7]. It has displayed good effects on inhibiting tumor cell cycle and inducing apoptosis in various cancers such as lung cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer and cervical cancer [8]. Moreover, quercetin has a synergistic effect when used in combination with cisplatin and other chemotherapeutic drugs, which is expected to further improve the therapeutic results of traditional chemotherapy [9]. In view of the advantages of quercetin in the treatment of various types of tumors, we wonder whether it can be applied in the treatment of OC to overcome the numerous problems faced by the clinical treatment of OC.",
        "Telomerase can ensure chromosome stability by maintaining the telomere length, thus delaying cell death and aging. Telomerase is composed of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase RNA (TR) [10]. Of them, TERT, as the catalytic subunit of telomerase, has the activity of reverse transcriptase, which can accelerate DNA replication, and plays a key role in cancer formation [11]. In addition to accelerating the cell cycle, TERT also participates in the interaction of Wnt/β-catenin and NF-kB signaling pathways, inducing the malignant process of tumors [12]. Additionally, TERT can also interact with some transcription factors such as p53, WT1, CTCF and MZF-2, thereby inducing tumor occurrence [13]. Currently, there are relatively few therapeutic targets for OC. TERT is a highly expressed molecule in most tumors [14], can it be used as a therapeutic target for OC? Can it work synergistically with quercetin that also inhibits the cell cycle?",
        "With the rapid development of nanomedicine, the nanocarrier drug delivery platform has emerged, which can not only achieve the efficient delivery of combined drugs, but also improve drug targeting, thus achieving the more accurate tumor therapy [15]. A number of natural compounds have the problems like poor stability, poor water solubility and low bioavailability, which have severely restricted their clinical application. Mesoporous silicon dioxide (MSN), as a functional nanoparticle, has great application potential, and research on its application in tumor has also increased rapidly due to the numerous studies in the field of biomedicine [16]. Due to the unique highly porous structure, adjustable pore size structure, easy surface functional modification, good biocompatibility and stability, MSN can greatly improve bioavailability while enhancing drug safety [17]. MSN can also be assembled with polycations so that its surface is positively charged, which in turn effectively loads negatively charged nucleic acids through the potential electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, tumor cells or newly formed blood vessels can specifically express certain integrins such as αvβ3, which can bind to the RGD peptide with certain affinity, so carrying RGD peptide on nanocarriers can make drugs better target tumors.",
        "This study aimed to further explore QR potential in OC treatment. Focused on the relationship among QR, TERT, and the P53 pathway, hypothesizing TERT's interference with QR-induced P53 activation. Moreover, a novel nanoparticle (RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT) was designed and prepared for the combined administration of quercetin and shTERT in vivo (Sch. 1). It provides a safe and effective strategy for the treatment of OC.Scheme 1.Schematic illustration of RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT preparation and suppression of OC by activating the P53/Bax pathway",

Totally 1 × 106 tumor cells were suspended in 100 μl PBS and injected subcutaneously into the flank of mice. Divided the mice into five groups: control group, shTERT + QR group, RGD-PEG group, RGD-MSN/QR group and RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT group. For the control group, we administered PBS via gavage. For the shTERT + QR group, we administered quercetin at a dose of 159 mg/kg via gavage, combined with 1 mg/kg of shTERT via tail vein injection. For the RGD-PEG group, we administered 100 μl of RGD-PEG via tail vein injection. For the RGD-MSN/QR group, we administered 100 μl of RGD-MSN/QR via tail vein injection. For the RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT group, we administered 100 μl of RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT via tail vein injection.

        "Quercetin showed good tumor inhibiting effect in many types of tumors. To investigate whether quercetin could induce the apoptosis of OC, we applied quercetin at different concentrations to interfere with OC cell lines ES-2 and SKOV-3, so as to detect the effect of quercetin on OC. Changes in the proliferative ability of OC cell lines were detected by CCK-8 assay after intervention with different concentrations of quercetin. The results of CCK-8 assay suggested that quercetin at 5 μM and 10 μM inhibited the proliferation of OC (72 h: 0 μM vs. 5 μM, ES-2: p = 0.0004, SKOV-3: p = 0.0008; 0 μM vs. 10 μM, ES-2: p = 0.0003, SKOV-3: p = 0.0002), and the inhibitory effect was more obvious with the increase in concentration and the extension of time (Fig. 1A). The above views were verified by cell cloning assay and EdU assay (cell cloning assay: 0 μM vs. 5 μM, ES-2: p = 0.0003, SKOV-3: p = 0.0004; 0 μM vs. 10 μM, ES-2: p = 0.0001, SKOV-3: p = 0.0001; EdU assay: 0 μM vs. 5 μM, ES-2: p = 0.0004, SKOV-3: p = 0.0003; 0 μM vs. 10 μM, ES-2: p = 0.0003, SKOV-3: p = 0.0002) (Fig. 1B, C). It has been evidenced that quercetin can block cell cycle in cancers like liver cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer. In this study, flow cytometry was conducted to detect the changes in cell cycle of OC after intervention with different concentrations of quercetinn. It was discovered that after quercetin intervention, OC cells accumulated at the G0/G1 phase, and the degree increased with the increase in quercetin concentration (0 μM vs. 5 μM, ES-2: p = 0.0006, SKOV-3: p = 0.0008; 0 μM vs. 10 μM, ES-2: p = 0.0005, SKOV-3: p = 0.0004) (Fig. 1D).Fig. 1Quercetin inhibits the cycle of ovarian cancer cells and unable to induce apoptosis.

        "We further explored whether quercetin could induce the apoptosis of OC cells. The apoptosis level of OC cell lines after different concentrations of quercetin was detected by flow cytometry. As a result, the apoptosis level of OC was not significantly affected by quercetin (0 μM vs. 5 μM, ES-2: p = 0.7366, SKOV-3: p = 0.2478; 0 μM vs. 10 μM, ES-2: p = 0.4852, SKOV-3: p = 0.8263) (Fig. 1E). The Tunel assay also confirmed the results of flow cytometry (0 μM vs. 5 μM, ES-2: p = 0.3646, SKOV-3: p = 0.9624; 0 μM vs. 10 μM, ES-2: p = 0.5468, SKOV-3: p = 0.3663) (Fig. 1F). Therefore, quercetin can only inhibit the proliferation of OC cells but not induce the apoptosis of OC cells.",
        "To explore the specific mechanism by which quercetin inhibited the proliferation of OC cells but failed to induce apoptosis, we conducted a network pharmacology analysis. A total of 507 drug target genes were obtained by screening the quercetin active ingredients from the TCMSP database. With “ovarian cancer” being the keyword, 13,078 OC-related genes were identified based on the GeneCard disease gene database. The targets of quercetin active ingredients were intersected with those associated with OC disease, and altogether 484 candidate action genes were obtained (Fig. 2A). The selected action genes were imported into the STRING database for PPI analysis. Cytoscape software was employed to construct the interaction network diagram (Fig. 2B), in which TP53 had the highest interaction score. Moreover, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed on the action genes, and it was found that these genes were enriched into pathways like “KEGG: Pathways in cancer”, and “KEGG: p53 signaling pathway” (Fig. 2C, D).Fig. 2Quercetin inhibits ovarian cancer via the P53 pathway by network pharmacological analysis.

        "Previous studies have reported that the activation of P53 can inhibit the cell cycle and proliferation by activating P21/Rb [18]. Meanwhile, the activation of P53 can also up-regulate BAX and induce apoptosis (Fig. 2E) [19]. Based on the correspondence between the active ingredients and the potential targets, the core target proteins were subjected to molecular docking with quercetin. As a result, quercetin had a stable binding with P53 and P21 (Fig. 2F–G). Western blotting was performed to verify the expression levels of the above key proteins, and it was found that after quercetin intervention, the expression levels of P53, BAX and Bcl-2 were not significantly changed, while that of P21 was significantly up-regulated with the increase in quercetin (0 μM vs. 5 μM, ES-2: p = 0.0036, SKOV-3: p = 0.3949; 0 μM vs. 10 μM ES-2: p = 0.0004, SKOV-3: p = 0.0007) (Fig. 2H). Therefore, in OC cells, the inability of quercetin to activate P53 is the cause for its failure to induce apoptosis.",
        "To explore the potential mechanism of quercetin in inhibiting OC, we constructed the subcutaneous tumorigenic nude mouse models with ES-2 and SKOV-3 OC cell lines, and divided them into the control group and the quercetin group for gavage of normal saline and quercetin, respectively. The sample size of each group was three (n = 3). The animals were killed 28 days later (Fig. 3A), and the tumors were dissected (Fig. 3B). Through comparing the tumor size, we found that the tumor size in the quercetin group was slightly smaller than that in the control group, but the difference was not significant (control vs. quercetin groups ES-2: p = 0.0786 SKOV-3: p = 0.0432) (Fig. 3C, D). The mouse tumors constructed with two cell lines were subjected to proteomic analysis. In the proteomics analysis of the ES-2 subcutaneous tumorigenic model mice, altogether 106 differential genes were detected upon the screening conditions of |log fold-change|> 1 and p. value < 0.05. Compared with the control group, there were 48 up-regulated and 58 down-regulated genes in the quercetin group (Fig. 3E&G). Under the same screening conditions, a total of 470 differential genes were identified in the SKOV-3 subcutaneous tumorigenic model mice. Relative to the control group, 205 up-regulated and 265 down-regulated genes were detected in the quercetin group (Fig. 3F&H). The differential genes obtained by the two proteomics analyses were intersected, which revealed 4 common up-regulated (Fig. 3I) and 5 common down-regulated genes (Fig. 3J). We subsequently performed KEGG and GO enrichment analyses on the two groups of differential genes respectively (Fig. 3K–N), and the results indicated that the two groups of differential genes were enriched to the “KEGG: P53 signaling pathway”. Therefore, this further confirms that in OC, quercetin can affect the P53 pathway.Fig. 3Quercetin unable to induce apoptosis in ovarian cancer was analyzed by proteomics and TCGA database.

        "However, the above results still did not explain why quercetin failed to activate P53. To further explore the reason, we used the TCGA-OC database for the correlation analysis between TP53 and other genes (Fig. 3O–P), and discovered that TERT was significantly positively correlated with TP53. TERT, a telomerase reverse transcriptase, plays a key role in the formation of cancer and is highly expressed in OC as a potential therapeutic target for OC [20]. The Uniprot database was employed to predict the interaction between P53 and TERT proteins (Fig. 3Q), and CO-IP assays were carried out on P53 and TERT proteins in OC cell lines (Fig. 3R). The results indicated that there was an interaction between P53 and TERT. This suggests that the inability of quercetin to activate P53 protein in OC may be related to TERT binding to P53, which limited the role of P53 in inducing cell apoptosis.",
        "To verify this hypothesis, we performed TERT knockdown on OC cells (Fig. 4A). The effect of shTERT combined with quercetin on the changes in OC cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay. The results suggested that the combination of shTERT with quercetin better inhibited the proliferation of OC (Control vs. QR + shTERT, ES-2: p = 0.0008, SKOV-3: p = 0.0006; QR vs. QR + shTERT, ES-2: p = 0.0427, SKOV-3: p = 0.0097; shTERT vs. QR + shTERT, ES-2: p = 0.0378, SKOV-3: p = 0.0154) (Fig. 4B).

        "We detected the apoptosis of OC cell lines after intervention with different concentrations of quercetin by flow cytometry. The results suggested that the apoptosis level of OC cells was significantly enhanced after the combined intervention of shTERT with quercetin (Control vs. QR + shTERT, ES-2: p = 0.0007, SKOV-3: p = 0.0006; QR vs. QR + shTERT, ES-2: p = 0.0002, SKOV-3: p = 0.0003; shTERT vs. QR + shTERT, ES-2: p = 0.0007, SKOV-3: p = 0.0006) (Fig. 4D).

The combined intervention of quercetin with shTERT could better inhibit the proliferation of OC and induce apoptosis. Meanwhile, such results also further verify that the inability of quercetin to activate P53 protein is related to TERT binding to p53.",
        "Our in vitro experiments demonstrated the advantages of the combined intervention of quercetin with shTERT in inducing OC apoptosis. However, beeing prone to degradation of shTERT in body, low bioavailability of quercetin and lack targeting of combination therapy are still problems to be solved for in vivo therapy. To achieve the co-delivery of quercetin and shTERT and solve the above problems, we prepared the QR-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Fig. 5A). Firstly, the MSN/QR drug-loaded nanoparticles loaded with the TCM monomer QR were synthesized; secondly, drug-loaded nanoparticles were coated with positively charged RGD-PEG, so that the nanoparticles could target drugs, and the synthesized drug-carrying nanoparticles were positively charged. Finally, shTERT was adsorbed by static electricity to form RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT.Fig. 5Preparation and characterization of RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT.

        "Next, we employed a variety of technical methods to characterize the nanoparticles. Through performing dynamic light scattering measurements, it was found that the hydrodynamic diameter was 239.53 nm, while the diameter of the nanoparticles increased to 242.61 nm (Fig. 5B), and the zeta potential changed from 28.74 ± 3.74 mV to 9.14 ± 1.35 mV when shTERT was connected (Fig. 5C). The particle size distribution of both nanoparticles was relatively narrow, indicating that the synthesized nanoparticles maintained good uniformity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that both RGD-MSN/QR and RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT had uniform spherical structures (Fig. 5D).",
        "We further tested the drug release levels of RGD-MSN/QR and RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT (Fig. 5E), and discovered that the release rates of QR and shTERT were relatively fast at the initial stage, and gradually became flattened after 12 h. Since shRNA is linked with the disadvantages of poor stability and easy degradation of ribonuclease (RNase), we adopted nanoparticles encapsulation to solve this dilemma while improving the efficiency of drug delivery. To verify the protective effect of nanoparticles on shTERT, the naked shRNA and RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT were incubated with RNase for different time periods (0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h), and then agar-gel electrophoresis was performed. We observed the rapid degradation of naked siRNA in the presence of RNase, while the nanoparticles maintained the major structural integrity of shRNA after 12 h (Fig. 5F). The above results show that the nanoparticles have high stability and can protect the degradation of shRNA, which lay a good foundation for the follow-up in vivo experiments.",
        "Furthermore, to verify the uptake of nanoparticles by OC cells in vitro, shTERT was labeled with Cy5, and OC cells were intervened with PBS, shTERT, and RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT, respectively. Later, cell uptake was studied through confocal laser microscopy. The images revealed that, incubation with RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT exhibited the strongest intracellular fluorescence intensity, while cells treated with shTERT had slightly weaker fluorescence intensity and cells cultured with PBS showed no fluorescence (Fig. 5G). This suggests that the nanoparticles can be taken up by OC cells. At the same time, to explore the targeting of nanoparticles, PBS, shTERT and RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT were injected intravenous into the tail vein of tumorigenic mice (Fig. 5H), and the results demonstrated that only the RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT group showed strong fluorescence at the tumor site, suggesting that the nanoparticles have good targeting property.",
        "Finally, we evaluated the safety of nanoparticles by injecting PBS, RGD-PEG, RGD-MSN/QR, and RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT into the tail vein of mice, respectively. After nanoparticle intervention, mice did not show hemolysis (Fig. S1A). By comparing the H&E stained sections of the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and intestinal tissues, it was discovered that there was no difference between the nanoparticle group and the control group (Fig. S1B). Serum biochemical analyses (serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TBIL) and urea nitrogen (BUN)) and blood routine detection were performed [white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), and platelet (PLT)] to evaluate the biosafety of nanoparticles in vivo. The blood cell and serum biochemical indexes of all mice were within the normal range, and the differences were negligible (Fig. S1C-J), further proving that the nanoparticles have certain safety.",
        "To further verify the anti-OC effect of RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT in vivo, subcutaneous tumorigenic mice were divided into the control group, shTERT + QR group, RGD-PEG group, RGD-MSN/QR group, and RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT group, and injected with PBS, shTERT, RGD-PEG, RGD-MSN/QR and RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT, and intervened respectively (Fig. 6A). The sample size of each group was three (n = 3). After 28 days of intervention, the mice were killed (Fig. 6B), and the tumors were dissected (Fig. 6C). We found that the tumors of mice in the RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT group were significantly smaller than those in the control group and shTERT + QR group (Control vs. RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT, ES-2: p = 0.0007, SKOV-3: p = 0.0004; RGD-MSN/QR vs. RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT, ES-2: p = 0.0092, SKOV-3: p = 0.0003; shTERT + QR vs.RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT, ES-2: p = 0.0326, SKOV-3: p = 0.0084) (Fig. 6D).Fig. 6The effect of RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT against inhibition in ovarian cancer in vivo.

        "Meanwhile, the expression levels of key proteins in five groups of mice were detected by immunohistochemistry. As a result, the expression levels of P53 and BAX in RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT group were significantly higher than those in the other four groups, and the expression level of Bcl-2 was significantly lower than those in the other four groups. Meanwhile, we also found that the expression levels of P21 in the RGD-MSN/QR and RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT groups were significantly higher than those in the other three groups, and that of p-Rb was significantly lower than those in the other three groups (Fig. 6E). This further proves that quercetin combined with shTERT can activate the P53/BAX signaling pathway, and our constructed RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT can safely and effectively exert the combined anti-OC effect in vivo.",
        "The treatment of OC is encountered with numerous difficult problems at present. First, OC is prone to widespread metastasis, which greatly increases the difficulty and complexity of treatment [21]. Secondly, for advanced patients, chemotherapy is the only proven effective strategy currently, but with the progress of treatment, cancer cells often develop drug resistance, and may also induce a series of serious adverse reactions, seriously affecting the quality of life of patients and the tolerance of subsequent treatment [2]. Moreover, OC has a high recurrence rate; for the treatment of recurrent OC, the effective treatment options are relatively limited, the choice of drugs is more difficult, and the disease progression is often faster, accompanied by the worse prognosis [3]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to study and innovate a safe and effective treatment to improve the prognosis and quality of life of OC patients.",
        "In this study, we first used quercetin, a natural compound with good therapeutic effect on tumors, to intervene with OC cells, and found that it only inhibited the cell proliferation, but not induced cell apoptosis. Additionally, upon network pharmacology and proteomics analyses, the excessive TERT binding to P53 in OC was identified as the cause of this phenomenon. Secondly, we used shTERT combined with quercetin for in vitro intervention and discovered that the combined treatment better inhibited the proliferation of OC while inducing apoptosis. Finally, to make this combined treatment safe, effective and targeted in vivo, we designed and prepared a new nanoparticle (RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT) for the combined administration of quercetin and shTERT. As revealed by in vivo experiments, RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT showed favorable targeting ability, remarkable OC inhibiting effect and negligible adverse reactions.",
        "Quercetin has demonstrated a variety of anti-tumor mechanisms, providing a new potential approach for tumor treatment, but further research is still needed to fully explore its clinical application value. Firstly, quercetin has a significant effect on inducing apoptosis. According to numerous studies, it can trigger the apoptosis of cancer cells via a variety of pathways. In breast cancer studies, quercetin can reduce the expression level of NADH reductase coenzyme I in breast cancer cells, thus promoting the apoptosis of cancer cells [22]. In pancreatic cancer research, quercetin can reduce the expression level of FLICE-like inhibitory protein in cells, enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and thus induce the apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells [23]. This ability to induce apoptosis of different cancer cells reflects the key role of quercetin in tumor treatment. Secondly, the regulation of quercetin on cell cycle is also an important mechanism of its anti-tumor activity. In the study on colon cancer, quercetin can inhibit the vitality of colon cancer cells and induce their apoptosis through MAPKs pathway, while arresting the cell cycle at a specific stage and effectively preventing the proliferation of cancer cells [24]. In the research on lung cancer, quercetin can reduce the phosphorylation of histone proteins, thus leading to the arrest of cancer cell cycle and inhibiting tumor growth [25]. It shows great potential in anti-tumor treatment [26]. However, in our study, due to the over-binding of P53 to TERT in OC, quercetin only inhibited OC proliferation and cell cycle, but did not induce apoptosis, which greatly limits the application of quercetin in the treatment of OC.",
        "In the complex network of cell cycle regulation, the P53/P21 pathway occupies a key position and plays an important and fine regulatory role in the process of cell cycle. Under normal circumstances, P53 protein, as the “guardian of the genome”, always monitors the stability of the intracellular environment. Once the cells experience stress signals such as DNA damage, oncogene activation, hypoxia or telomere shortening, P53 protein will be activated and accumulated rapidly. After its activation, it can bind specifically to the promoter region of P21 gene to drive the transcriptional expression of P21 gene [27]. As a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), P21 binds tightly to the CDK-cyclin complex to inhibit its kinase activity. Complexes such as CDK4/6-cyclin D and CDK2-cyclin E play a key role in the transition from G1 phase to S phase of the cell cycle. The binding of P21 to these complexes effectively blocks the phosphorylation modification of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), thereby maintaining the stability of the genome [28]. In certain types of tumors, the P53 gene is often mutated or missing, resulting in the loss or abnormality of P53 protein function, as well as the inability to effectively activate the expression of P21. As a result, the expression level of P21 is significantly down-regulated, the cell cycle is out of control, and the cell proliferation rate is greatly improved. Apart from the classical P53 direct regulation of P21 pathway, there are other signaling pathways interweaving with the P53/P21 pathway to synergistically induce tumors, such as the P53/BAX pathway. The P53/BAX pathway has a key role in inducing tumor cell apoptosis and has far-reaching significance for the development of cancer treatment strategies. When cells suffer from DNA damage caused by carcinogenic factors, P53 protein rapidly accumulates and binds to the BAX gene promoter region, enhancing its transcriptional activity and promoting the increase in BAX protein level, ultimately leading to the execution of the apoptosis procedure [29]. In OC cells, quercetin bound to P21 to inhibit cell proliferation. However, the over-binding of TERT to P53 not only restricted P53-mediated apoptosis but also blocked quercetin's interaction with P53. When TERT was silenced using shTERT, P53 was liberated to induce apoptosis and strengthen cell cycle arrest. Concurrently, quercetin gained access to P53, intensifying both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Sch. 1). We hypothesize that  quercetin enhances the stability of P53 protein, protecting it from degradation and thereby potentiating its apoptotic and cell cycle-regulatory effects, but this needs to be further confirmed.",
        "TERT is telomerase reverse transcriptase, which is involved in the repair of telomeres and plays a crucial role in the process of OC cell cycle. From the perspective of telomere maintenance, TERT, as a key catalytic subunit of telomerase, stabilizes the terminal structure of chromosomes by extending the telomere length, thereby preventing replicative senescence or apoptosis of cells caused by telomere shortening, and continuously carrying out the cell cycle, enabling the continuous proliferation of tumor cells and the development of tumor [30]. The role of TERT also varies at different stages of the cell cycle. During the transition from G1 phase to S phase, TERT promotes cells to successfully pass the restriction point and enter the DNA synthesis phase by regulating the activities of related cyclin and CDK. In the S phase, the function of TERT to maintain telomere length is essential to ensure the integrity of DNA replication, preventing DNA damage and cell cycle arrest due to telomere abnormalities [31]. In our study, after the combined intervention, OC cells not only accumulated at the G0/G1 phase, but also more accumulated at the S phase, so as to better inhibit the cell cycle. This process may be associated with the silencing of TERT, and the combined treatment can not only induce apoptosis, but also better block the cell cycle.",
        "In the process of combined application of quercetin with shTERT in vivo against OC, we need to solve many problems such as low availability, poor drug targeting and poor drug synergy of the natural compound quercetin. Because of its unique structure and characteristics, MSN has been used in the research of tumor treatment as a highly safe, controllable drug delivery carrier. Using MSN as a carrier, numerous natural compounds overcome the defects of poor water solubility, greatly improving the bioavailability [32]. Meanwhile, MSN has two functional surfaces, which can be easily functionalized [33] and properly connected or modified with other materials. On the one hand, it is assembled with polycations, so that its surface is positively charged, and it can be attached to shRNA, facilitating the synergistic administration with natural compounds. On the other hand, it can also bind to some targeted functional peptides, so that the drug can better target the tumor.",
        "In summary, this study demonstrates the mechanism and therapeutic advantages of the combination of quercetin with shTERT against OC. Based on this mechanism, a novel nanoparticle (RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT) was designed and prepared for the combined administration of quercetin with shTERT in vivo. The results showed RGD-MSN/QR/shTERT could effectively inhibit the tumor growth and induce cell apoptosis of OC, while showing good targeting and in vivo safety. We believe that this study can provide new safe and effective ideas for the current clinical treatment of OC.",

        "The urgency for disruptive technologies continues to be underscored by the rising tide of chronic diseases afflicting an aging global population [1]. By 2020, chronic diseases—in particular cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and respiratory conditions—will collectively cause more than 70% of all deaths in the world [2, 3]. Moreover, among people 60 years and older, half suffer from disabilities—most frequently visual and hearing impairments, dementia, or osteoarthritis [4]. These trends, in part, reflect success in treating acute conditions, injuries, and congenital anomalies. However, the growth of an increasingly elderly population and the prevalence of age-precipitated degenerative diseases and disabilities impose a pressing mandate to decipher actionable mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility and poor outcome, and in turn develop safe and effective strategies that would limit organ dysfunction and reverse tissue degeneration. In this context, regenerative medicine aspires to repair tissues and assemble replacement organs, offering next-generation solutions in promoting longitudinal wellness while reducing the socioeconomic burden associated with chronic disease management [5].",
        "The respected U.S. Department of Health and Human Services perspective “2020: A New Vision” [6] recognizes regenerative medicine at the forefront of health care. Technological innovation and progress in translating regenerative science into clinical application augur well for a transformative impact inherent to the practice of regenerative medicine. Propelled by success in treating leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma and more generally by remarkable advances in transplantation, regenerative applications are often considered definitive in purpose and a common framework across practices. Indeed, hematopoietic stem cell transplant is today a life-saving, curative treatment not only for certain hematological malignancies but also for immunodeficiencies, metabolic storage diseases, and in discrete cases extracellular matrix disorders including epidermolysis bullosa. Similarly, solid organ transplantation not only extends life in patients with organ failure but can also improve quality of life. Beyond life-extending measures that are often the last available option, regenerative strategies—agnostic to medical or surgical specialties—target functional and structural restoration, offering the prospect of hope and solutions for many of today’s incurable diseases.",
        "Multimodal regenerative methods incorporate transplant of healthy tissues, prompt the body to enact a regenerative self-healing response in damaged tissues, and use tissue engineering to manufacture new tissue. Stem cells and derived products are the distinctive active ingredients used in regenerative regimens that leverage their capacity to form de novo tissue and/or promote innate repair [7, 8]. The European Medicines Agency has recently recommended the first advanced therapy medicinal product containing stem cells for treatment for moderate-to-severe corneal limbal stem cell deficiency caused by physical or chemical burns to the eye that can result in blindness [9]. Approval of cellular immunotherapy products, as well as cartilage‐derived chondrocytes for repair of symptomatic cartilage defects and mesenchymal stem cell products in graft-versus-host disease, further reflects an ongoing global progress in the conversion of preclinical/clinical trial experiences into bona fide registered therapies [10]. In parallel, advances in materials science and biotechnology offer complementary prospects for growing tissue biografts and for engineering whole organs [11, 12]. Whereas medicine in the 20th century has pioneered treatments to ameliorate/mitigate symptoms of disease, regenerative medicine may be the harbinger of 21st century medicine, wherein the focus is on the root cause of disease and curative options paramount [13, 14].",
        "Building on the promise of regenerative science and the growing medical and societal needs, there is urgency to design, execute, and validate viable paradigms for translating and implementing regenerative medicine into tangible health benefits that provide value to patients and stakeholders. We here recognize some of the translational challenges while sharing our experience in the build-out of regenerative medicine at Mayo Clinic in the context of a growing community of practice. Engagement and investment by all stakeholders is critical to ensuring success of a comprehensive regenerative medicine blueprint.",
        "With the outlook of tangible health benefits and the prospect of challenging rising health care costs, translation of regenerative technologies has the potential to add value and extend current models of care. Notwithstanding, adoption of regenerative medicine in practice requires a fundamental shift in the health care business model to implement distinctive regenerative tenets. Although the transformative power of regenerative medicine is generally recognized by physicians, patients, and payers, the complexity of translating discoveries into new modalities that transform health care is less appreciated. As a working example, patients themselves, in this model, would provide the actual source material that will serve to produce ultimate therapies. Current treatments are constrained either by the supply of source material or the limits associated with the inability to tailor definitive therapeutic solutions to the individual patient. The former is exemplified by donor organ shortage for transplantation, with an estimated 122,553 people needing a life-saving organ transplant in this country today [15]. The latter is exemplified by the needs and risks associated with lifelong immunosuppression in patients receiving a donated organ [16]. Rollout of regenerative solutions in practice will require clinical-grade biotherapies suitable for scale-up and standardized production and application.",
        "The challenges inherent in translating a research-grade method to a reproducible and robust manufacturing process suitable for routine production are significant [17, 18]. Scalability, automation, raw material supply, intermediate and product stability, grade of clean room, process control and general process robustness/failure rate, and the cost of goods all exemplify pertinent issues [19]. The sector has been traditionally subdivided into autologous and allogeneic therapies that are often then served by a decentralized or a centralized production model, respectively, although this distinction has started to evolve with hybrid models emerging [19]. As the industry matures, inclusive supply chain capabilities that integrate sourcing, manufacturing, and care delivery will become the norm [20].",
        "A comprehensive supply chain is essential for the expedited introduction of regenerative medicine products and services into clinical practice. The supply chain for the application of biotherapies requires the development of an array of tools and decision-support processes aimed at a quality-controlled production and delivery of clinical grade products that fulfill patient needs and specifications. At present, the fundamental capabilities required for the manufacture of clinical-grade biotherapies are typically confined to limited applications (e.g., bone marrow stem cell transplant for indications in hematology/oncology), a recognized barrier to the broader introduction of regenerative medicine as a scalable and standardized practice.",
        "The supply chain of patient- and donor-derived regenerative medicine products critically rely on technology industrialization. This multifaceted landscape encompasses the identification of clinical need, patient stratification, procurement of patient materials, production of the therapeutic agent, (re)introduction of the therapeutic agent to the patient, and assessment of response. For the needs of this supply chain to be met in a way that optimally impacts care across a wide range of medical conditions, technical and mechanical advancements are required, as is the creation of an informatics architecture to support and manage the logistics of patient sample collection, scaled manufacturing, product return to provider, and reliable clinical delivery. Considering regenerative medicine in the context of supply chain management highlights essential points of vulnerability and/or scalability that can ultimately constrain translation of the biological revolution or potentiate it into individualized diagnostics and therapeutics for optimized value creation and delivery [20].",
        "At Mayo Clinic, “regenerative medicine” is a declared institutional priority—launched by the Board of Governors—underscoring the organizational readiness for knowledge translation in chronic care [21]. The Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Medicine serves as a catalyst and coordinator in the discovery-development-delivery cycle established for the express purpose of deploying regenerative solutions across medical, surgical, and laboratory medicine practices [22]. Managing risks and implementing strategy encompasses planning, budgeting, forecasting, and decision support. The Mayo Clinic regenerative medicine blueprint incorporates dedicated patient access, enabling technology platforms and multispecialty delivery (Fig. 1).",
        "Regenerative medicine blueprint catalyzed by the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Medicine. Powered by advances in fundamental sciences and responding to the unmet patient needs across clinical specialties, the Mayo Clinic regenerative medicine service line build-out incorporates dedicated patient access, enabling technology platforms and multispecialty delivery. Regenerative Medicine Portals refer to a Regenerative Medicine Consult Service (or alternate specialty services) coordinating patient access. Regenerative Medicine Platforms refer to integrated collection, preservation, processing, quality assurance, manufacture, and release of clinical-grade regenerative cellular, acellular, and biomaterial products. Regenerative Medicine Procedures refer to delivery of regenerative therapies across medical and surgical specialties.",
        "Patient access is coordinated, beyond traditional specialty services, via a global portal: the Regenerative Medicine Consult Service (Fig. 1, bottom left). The Regenerative Medicine Consult Service is one of the first dedicated clinical consult services in the U.S. and is operationalized to serve both patients and providers [23]. Indications for a regenerative medicine consult include chronic, degenerative, and congenital disease or other conditions for which the patient or clinician has questions about the value of cell-based or other regenerative therapies. The Regenerative Medicine Consult Service serves as an initial point of care and relies on the expertise of a multispecialty knowledge content board to provide the following services: patient and provider education, procurement of annotated patient biomaterials, referral to standard-of-care services when applicable, and implementation of a regenerative intervention, often in the context of a clinical trial [23]. Clinical visits are charted in the electronic medical record using the service code “Regenerative Medicine,” and episodes of care are documented. Systems and procedures currently in place enable the Regenerative Medicine Consult Service to participate in ongoing care plans.",
        "The patient experience further integrates collection, preservation, processing, and manufacture of clinical-grade biospecimens for current and future diagnostic and therapeutic use (Fig. 1, center). To this end, the Mayo Clinic Regenerative Medicine Biotrust, a multifunctional repository and refinery, works closely with the Regenerative Medicine Consult Service to source cells and other biospecimens from individual patients. This patient-derived resource provides the foundation for a regenerative theranostics support system to meet anticipated needs. The specific functions of the Regenerative Medicine Biotrust are to generate, process, profile, store, disseminate, and dispense cost-effective, quality-assured patient-derived regenerative products that meet regulatory standards [24]. The Regenerative Medicine Biotrust thus offers a centralized reference and may evolve into a personalized bioinsurance for lifelong disease risk management. Complementing the Biotrust, state-of-the-art current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) facilities have been developed. These include the Human Cell Therapy Laboratory, Biomaterials Resource, and Advanced Products Incubator. Management of manufacturing and quality-control testing in these facilities are carried out according to cGMP requirements, that is, minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packaging of a product. The Human Cell Therapy Laboratory, an enterprise-wide activity embedded within the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology with facilities on Mayo Clinic’s campuses in Arizona, Florida, and Rochester, employs cutting-edge know-how to support cell-based clinical applications [25]. This facility has an established track record in cGMP procedures required for the production of bone marrow-derived and non-bone marrow-derived stem cells and an in-depth understanding of the processes required for the provision of these products in a clinical trial environment that is compliant with regulatory agencies including the Food and Drug Administration [26]. The Biomaterials Resource is designed to support the manufacture of clinical-grade biologics for biomaterial applications, either alone or in conjunction with cell-based therapy. The Advanced Products Incubator is designed to accelerate the application of novel regenerative products with the focus on developing cell-free biologics-based platforms [27]. Collectively, technology platforms ensure high-quality conformance in consistency, uniformity, and stability as per Food and Drug Administration guidelines.",
        "A regenerative medicine model of care challenges traditional tenets associated not only with manufacture but also with the delivery of clinical products and services. Traditional drug therapy is typically self-administered and widely accessible. With regenerative medicine options, selected patients will be treated by specialists, limiting access and requiring advanced training of a new generation of medically qualified personnel and health care auxiliary staff. Moreover, the realization of highly tailored, personalized solutions wherein the patient provides the solution will require a major adjustment in the landscape for provision of health care services. The biotherapeutics, as a patient-derived resource, juxtaposes the patient and provider as never before and significantly alters the lines between production/manufacture and delivery.",
        "Delivery of regenerative medicine at Mayo Clinic is developed in conjunction and embedded within existing medical and surgical specialties. Mayo Clinic leverages its integrated team-based approach and world-class clinical laboratory practice and product manufacturing capabilities to drive the implementation of regenerative therapies and ensure that such treatments achieve standard service-line status.",
        "Although the focus today is on the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of promising regenerative solutions, additional consideration is needed for optimal delivery of regenerative applications across the medical and surgical practice. Mayo Clinic is engaged in the design and development of dedicated interventional suites for the delivery of regenerative products and services—in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Although a number of regenerative procedures can or will increasingly be performed in a customized outpatient setting, the delivery of regenerative medicine products will require specialized facilities equipped with multimodality imaging and advanced visualization technologies and with in-suite capabilities or proximal access to pre/postmanufacturing processing and/or manipulation of biotherapeutics. Across specialties, delivery protocols are developed in conjunction with pre/postdelivery care regimens ensuring seamless integration of a regenerative medicine intervention within patient management plans.",
        "To establish regenerative medicine service lines, Mayo Clinic has deployed a patient-centered, science-driven practice advancement paradigm deployed across the enterprise. Given this complexity and the diversity of required elements, the precise nature and goals of individual specialty efforts and how these efforts map into a broader vision for the provision of regenerative medicine services must be defined, prioritized, and operationalized. As a designated strategic priority, regenerative medicine is integral to the Mayo Clinic operating plan and jointly overseen by the executive leadership for practice and research. The build-out of service lines is based on the alignment with enterprise clinical priorities, unmet clinical need, capacity to be implemented across Mayo Clinic sites, multidisciplinary expertise, and technological/translational readiness. At Mayo Clinic, clinical trials—launch pads for testing novel therapeutics in humans—serve as a key indicator of technological/translational readiness across service lines (Fig. 2). Of note, the majority of regenerative medicine clinical trials are still at an early stage of development focused on demonstration of feasibility and safety and early indication of efficacy with few reaching at this point the later stages of pivotal clinical trial validation [28–45].",
        "Overview of clinical trials sponsored by the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Medicine. The spectrum of clinical trial categories underscores the multidisciplinary nature of the enterprise-wide endeavor engaging medical, surgical, and laboratory medicine specialties. Abbreviations: GI, gastrointestinal; iPS, induced pluripotent stem; POP, pelvic organ prolapse.",
        "Regenerative medicine has engaged specialties to assess and prioritize current and prospective regenerative service lines aimed to treat and/or alter the course of disease. To facilitate the process, a uniform framework has been developed delineating regenerative medicine activities spanning the discovery-translation-application continuum within each specialty and by clinical condition. For example, molecular and stem cell biology and small-animal-model testing are assigned to the discovery domain, large-animal-model testing and phase I clinical trials are in translation, and phase II/III clinical trials and clinical procedures are assigned to the application domain. A subset of these elements and where on the continuum they are assigned informs the decision process. This framework also enables the identification of gaps and/or barriers to advancing regenerative service lines and assigns principal oversight, that is, research (discovery, early translation) or clinical practice (late translation, application).",
        "Ultimately, viability and success of regenerative medicine will depend on securing regulatory approval and adequate reimbursement. To approach acceptance of regenerative therapies, payers are likely to require robust evidence of safety and efficacy until use becomes common. Site of care (e.g., inpatient or outpatient) is critical to reimbursement strategy, as is the designation of the technology as a biologic, drug, or device. Under existing legislation, cell-based therapies in the U.S. are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration as drugs with rules derived from those developed for chemical drugs. Whether transplantation of a patient’s own cells should be regulated as a drug or device or should be treated as a “practice of medicine” is currently a subject of debate. Regulatory designation of regenerative medicine therapies will play a key role in how public and private payers will interpret the therapy for reimbursement purposes and can accelerate or decelerate market access upon market clearance [46].",
        "A set of critical success factors—a regenerative medicine scorecard—has been established by which process and performance within the regenerative medicine space are objectively evaluated. These metrics are provided on a regular basis to institutional leaders and serve as a standing agenda item for review by the Center for Regenerative Medicine leadership team. The scorecard report system ensures the optimal advancement of regenerative science leading to the deployment of regenerative medicine practice that addresses critical unmet patient needs in alignment with institutional priorities. These metrics encompass the declared aims of (a) science-driven practice advancement, (b) education and training of next generation health care scientists and providers, (c) establishment of regenerative medicine and surgery products and service lines, and ultimately (d) rollout of a regenerative medicine model of care. Pertinent to the “regenerative science scorecard,” which focuses on promoting innovative team-based discovery-translation pipelines, the following parameters are monitored: peer-reviewed publications, sponsored grants and awards, research studies/clinical trials, patient enrollment, technology disclosures/patents, and investigational new drug or investigational device exemption portfolio. The “education and training scorecard” focuses on new regenerative science and medicine curricula offered at medical, graduate, and postgraduate levels; targeted career development programs; training and education of health professionals; learning collaboratives; and sponsorship of local, regional, national, and international educational offerings for professionals and the public. The “practice of regenerative medicine scorecard” is built on number and volume of regenerative products and services using the Health Care Common Procedure Coding System established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
        "Mayo Clinic is an integrated not-for-profit organization that closely collaborates with leading regenerative medicine enterprises, both public and private, nationally and internationally. In the U.S., the accelerated development of urgently needed therapies is a declared priority engaging multidisciplinary communities of practice [47]. To address patient and societal needs, clinical development algorithms rely on complementary stakeholders: patients, health care innovators/providers, industry developers, government regulators, and insurers/payers. Synergies generate resources, create infrastructures, and remove barriers to facilitate advancement of innovative therapies into mainstay practice. In this context, the common goal is ensuring the “validity” and “utility” of regenerative therapies to ensure regulatory approval and practice adoption. Uptake mandates a market advantage over available options and appropriate levels of coverage. As treatments with proven efficacy and documented improvement over the current standard of care emerge through clinical development programs, next-generation solutions will be gradually adopted and accepted as reimbursable therapies, ensuring wider patient access. Definitive, curative treatments that alleviate the need for more expensive, long-term, alternative care should in principle provide substantial health care savings and should thus be prioritized as the most promising therapeutic candidates.",
        "Growing public/private initiatives are evolving to expedite the regenerative medicine armamentarium. Case in point, Proposition 71 has established the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), which showcases a regional effort in committing resources toward the goal of advancing stem cell research and emerging therapies toward the clinic. In particular, the CIRM “Alpha Stem Cell Clinics” initiative aims to foster clinical trials, evaluate investigational cell therapies to obtain the evidence needed for establishing safe and effective therapies, and provide access and delivery of proven therapies to patients [48]. This model is in line with the concept of networked clinical research centers, the role of which is to provide clinical trial capacity for those studies involving registration, establishing proven therapies with benefits exceeding the alternative treatments presently available and enabling patients to access proven therapies. Patients who access Alpha Stem Cell Clinics include patients with no therapeutic options seeking experimental treatment and patients seeking standard-of-care treatment. Besides specialized workforce, this endeavor relies on specialized infrastructure, including on/off-site GMP facilities to enable the preparation of cell products and, where appropriate, their purification, storage, modification, expansion, and characterization. Some or all Alpha Stem Cell Clinics may be capable of providing treatments across a spectrum of stem cell applications and be networked to enable the capture of best practices [48].",
        "Furthermore, co-development partnerships in regenerative medicine aim to combine strengths and eliminate deficiencies and are evolving around technological expertise, commercialization, regulatory and/or clinical trial expertise, and financing [49]. The European Union, for example, has formed the Innovative Medicines Initiative to accelerate development of and access to innovative medicines, including regenerative medicine products, and has engaged regulators, researchers, and industry to advance a coordinated innovation agenda in the life sciences [47]. In parallel, new legal frameworks, such as the one allowing for conditional and provisional approval for regenerative medical products and technologies enforced recently in Japan under the Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Other Therapeutic Products Act, are expected to accelerate safe and fast provision of innovative products to patients with intractable diseases [50]. Notwithstanding, the highest stringency in maintaining the most rigorous standards for safety and efficacy is paramount. Moreover, regulatory harmonization initiatives transcend national and international boundaries and present an opportunity to reduce the costs of new therapy development by streamlining and limiting the requirements for global market approval [47].",
        "In an environment in which price protection is increasingly used in health contracting and in which the risk for treatment failure is still real, the pricing strategy for regenerative medicine interventions will need to be carefully examined. In particular, to improve the alignment between payments and better models of care, fee-for-value—rather than traditional fee-for-service—models with measurable outcomes that consider total cost of care are considered [51]. High pricing creates resistance among payers, consumers, and legislators/policy makers, and although the initial focus is on individual patient benefit and outcomes, ultimate success will be measured by the cost benefit to payers and society as a whole.",
        "Reinstating the physical and functional integrity of a damaged organ in the context of whole-person care is central in realizing the primary objective of regenerative medicine. Experience to date, both nationally and globally, indicates that the translation of regenerative principles into practice is largely feasible and consistently safe in the clinical setting. Regenerative medicine and surgery are, therefore, headed to transition from the ongoing proof-of-principle and proof-of-promise emphasis toward clinical validation and, ultimately, standardization, paving the way for next-generation management algorithms. Beyond safety and efficacy, regenerative therapies will be tested for equivalence across distinct socioeconomic and health care settings as an indicator that these new strategies can potentially reach broader populations in need. Adoption of regenerative therapies will require robust clinical evidence, including definitive answers to the long-term benefit of regenerative medicine protocols [52]. Ultimately, the rigor of comparative effectiveness outcome analysis will be needed to determine the value of introducing a regenerative therapy as standardized management.",
        "In the era of precision medicine, regenerative medicine will grow in conjunction with the realization of individualized medicine paradigms to create predictive, personalized, and preemptive solutions for tailored delivery of patient-specific solutions [53]. Individualized regenerative algorithms will be refined by diagnosis of the inherent reparative potential to identify patients who would particularly benefit from such interventions. Moreover, methods to enhance the propensity for repair outcome will be central in the processes of optimization [54, 55].",
        "Success in the delivery of regenerative medicine procedures will critically depend on the optimal selection of patient populations and the stratification of disease severity. The initial rollout of regenerative products and services will need to be matched with their value-added proposition, advancing the probability of intended outcome beyond current management strategies. As regenerative applications become increasingly common, the spectrum of patient participation will expand from no-option patients to increasingly include those with earlier stages of disease, ultimately moving toward preemptive interventions for disease prevention. Today, regenerative medicine procedures are largely used in patients with an otherwise dismal prognosis to bridge end-stage organ failure in an attempt to abort or delay high-risk transplant. Increasingly, regenerative medicine technologies with established safety are also applied in combination interventions as adjuvant therapy to augment the efficacy of standard care. In addition, prophylactic applications of regenerative products in neoadjuvant regimens are considered to offset the dose-limiting adverse effects of aggressive primary therapy. Moreover, in anticipation of or in response to disease and disability, growing new tissues and organs would offer fit-for-purpose solutions that can be applied routinely despite age, comorbidities, or disease severity. Thus, knowledge and delivery of regenerative medicine is poised to steadily transform health care service lines to address the unmet needs of patients and populations.",

    "title": "Regenerative medicine for the hepatobiliary system: A review. acute liver failure, is hampered by the scarcity of donors. Regenerative medicine provides an alternative therapeutic approach. Tremendous efforts dedicated to liver regenerative medicine include the delivery of transplantable cells, microtissues, and bioengineered whole livers via tissue engineering and the maintenance of partial liver function via extracorporeal support. This brief review summarizes the current status of regenerative medicine for the hepatobiliary system. For liver regenerative medicine, the focus is on strategies for expansion of transplantable hepatocytes, generation of hepatocyte-like cells, and therapeutic potential of engineered tissues in liver disease models. For biliary regenerative medicine, the discussion concentrates on the methods for generation of cholangiocyte-like cells and strategies in the treatment of biliary disease. Significant advances have been made in large-scale and long-term expansion of liver cells. The development of tissue engineering and stem cell induction technology holds great promise for the future treatment of hepatobiliary diseases. The application of regenerative medicine in liver still lacks extensive animal experiments. Therefore, a large number of preclinical studies are necessary to provide sufficient evidence for their therapeutic effectiveness. Much remains to be done for the treatment of hepatobiliary diseases with regenerative medicine. Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan. South China University of Technology, Guangdong, China.

        "Iatrogenic bile duct injury is a highly significant complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with an incidence ranging from 0.4% to 1.5% (de’Angelis et al., 2021). This can result in the development of biliary strictures, recurrent cholangitis, secondary biliary cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and even mortality. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) biliary stent implantation is a common clinical treatment. However, long-term implantation can lead to cholangitis and re-stenosis, which may require removal after the operation, potentially resulting in secondary injury (Siiki et al., 2018). Liver transplantation serves as a last resort for conditions such as biliary tract injury, BA, and PSC; however, it has limitations due to limited donor availability and autoimmune rejection. In addition, effective treatment options for refractory diseases such as BA, biliary tract tumors, and PSC are currently lacking. To gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of biliary tract diseases, researchers commonly rely on animal models and two-dimensional (2D) cell models. However, these models often exhibit species differences and individual variations, leading to non-homogeneous research results. Moreover, long-term cultured cells may undergo aging and gene mutations, further compromising the accuracy of experimental findings. In order to explore more effective models for bile duct research, emerging organoids have garnered significant attention in recent years.",
        "Due to the origin of seed cells and their highly realistic three-dimensional structure and function, organoid models effectively mitigate the limitations associated with animal models and two-dimensional cell models, thereby exhibiting significant potential in advancing biliary tract research. The development of biliary organoids relies on the inherent capacity of stem/progenitor cells for self-differentiation and self-organization. By utilizing bioreactors such as stirred bioreactor (SBR) and microfluidic bioreactor (MFB), these cells can progressively differentiate into three-dimensional aggregates that closely resemble the morphology and function of natural biliary tracts in an in vitro microenvironment, effectively mimicking the growth and development of organs in vivo. (Licata et al., 2023; O’Connell and Winter, 2020). This not only offers a novel approach for modeling biliary diseases, exploring underlying mechanisms, and screening drugs but also holds significant potential for regenerating and repairing bile duct injuries (Figure 1). This review provides a comprehensive overview of biliary organoid construction encompassing cell sources, construction techniques while further discussing its biomedical applications, current challenges, and future directions.",
        "Construction and application of biliary organoids. The diagram provides an overview of the origin of biliary organoid seed cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and biliary epithelial cells (BECs). The construction of biliary organoids using various techniques has facilitated their extensive utilization in disease modeling, investigation of disease mechanisms, drug screening, and advancement of regenerative medicine.",
        "Bioreactors and bioactive materials play pivotal roles in promoting the self-renewal, differentiation, and self-organization of stem/progenitor cells to generate 3D aggregates that closely mimic both the morphology and functionality of native biliary tracts, thus facilitating the development of biliary organoids. The construction process of biliary organoids can generally be divided into two main aspects: seed cell selection and construction techniques (Ogoke et al., 2021).",
        "The common seed cells that constitute biliary organoids include induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), ESCs, liver progenitor cells (LPCs), and biliary epithelial cells (BECs). BECs possess inherent stem cell potential and can be readily isolated from either biliary tract tissue or liver tissue, which are relatively accessible. Obtaining stem cells, particularly induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), typically involves a complex reprogramming process; however, iPSCs exhibit excellent proliferative capacity and broad differentiation potential (Sampaziotis et al., 2021). Therefore, the choice of seed cell type depends on specific research objectives and application scenarios (Sato et al., 2021).",
        "Roos et al. (2020) successfully generated a biliary organoid using biliary epithelial cells, which exhibited the expression of functional cholangiocyte-related genes (such as ANO1, NKCC1, CFTR, GGT, AQP1) and the basolateral receptor SCTR based on gene array analysis. Additionally, this organoid demonstrated typical cholangiocyte receptors: pancreatopoietin and somatostatin. Elci et al. (2024) developed a stable biliary organoid utilizing biliary epithelial cells that displayed essential characteristics of cholangiocytes including transport activity, primary cilium formation, and protective glycocalyx formation over an extended period. Sampaziotis et al. (2019) constructed distinct biliary organoids using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and primary biliary epithelial cells, which exhibited expression of biliary markers and stable maintenance of biliary cell function. This approach successfully addressed challenges related to maintaining, promoting proliferation, and achieving large-scale expansion of primary biliary epithelial cells. In2021, Expanding upon their previous research, Sampaziotis et al. (2021) subsequently developed an intrahepatic bile duct repair strategy by implanting a biliary organoid induced from extrahepatic biliary epithelial cells. Their findings have significant implications for the field of regenerative medicine focused on treating intrahepatic bile duct defects.",
        "Wu et al. (2019) employed a liver differentiation medium to induce hepatic differentiation of hiPSCs and successfully established hepatobiliary organoids (HBOs) exhibiting apical-basal polarity and mature biliary cell structures. Immunofluorescence staining targeting cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and α-tubulin confirmed the preservation of stable bile duct architecture within HBOs. Additionally, rhodamine 123 (Rh123) staining verified the efficient bile efflux function of these biliary structures. Wang et al. (2019) utilized a novel medium comprising Wnt3A, Activin A, Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP4), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2 to induce the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) towards the hepatic specification (HS) stage. Following supplementation with N2, B27, nicotinamide, ghrelin, N-acetylcysteine, epidermal growth factor (EGF), Wnt3A, Wnt enhancer (R-Spondin 1), small compounds A83-01, and forskolin for a duration of 10 days, a robust liver organoid (hEHOs) was generated that effectively maintained the phenotypic characteristics of hepatic stem/progenitor cells. This advancement in differentiating functional hepatocytes and biliary cells has significantly broadened the cell sources available for clinical research purposes.",
        "The construction technology of biliary organoids can be divided into traditional construction technology and new construction technology. Traditional construction techniques generally include embedding culture technology, rotary culture technology, hanging drop culture technology, magnetic suspension culture technology, and ultra-low adsorption culture technology, among which the most common one is embedding culture technology. The new construction technologies mainly include organ-on-a-chip technology, three-dimensional printing technology, four-dimensional printing technology, etc.",
        "The construction techniques for traditional biliary organoids primarily encompass:",
        "The term refers to a culture technology wherein cells are encapsulated within a matrix adhesive and subsequently supplemented with various signaling pathway proteins and growth factors, resulting in the formation of an active three-dimensional structure (Habanjar et al., 2021). This method is characterized by its simplicity of operation and mild culture environment; however, the absence of cell-to-cell interactions may pose challenges in achieving cellular aggregation into spheres. Additionally, the high cost of the matrix adhesive and production expenses hinder large-scale implementation (Lee et al., 2021).",
        "Lugli et al. (2016) initially employed the technique of embedding culture to cultivate stem/progenitor cells derived from the gallbladder into a gallbladder organoid, which demonstrated expression of cholangiocyte markers Keratin (KRT)19, cluster of differentiation (CD) 44, and claudin (CLDN)3 and could be maintained in vitro for over 1 year. However, when transplanted under the liver capsule, the physiological structure of the organoid could only be sustained for a duration of 2 weeks (Lugli et al., 2016). Zhang et al. (2024) developed a biliary tree stem cells (BTSCs) organoid culture system based on embedding culture technology called BTSCs-expansion-Glycogel-system (BEX-gel system), enabling efficient utilization of limited donor organs such as the gallbladder and bile duct to generate a substantial quantity of BTSCs while facilitating research on in vivo transformation of hBTSCs organoids (Zhang et al., 2024). In summary, embedding culture technology is a widely used method for rapidly and conveniently generating biliary organoids. However, the lack of standardization in the matrix gel often leads to compositional variations between batches, resulting in significant heterogeneity among the generated organoids.",
        "The rotating cell culture system (RCCS) is commonly employed to continuously rotate the cell culture medium, simulating a microgravity environment for cell growth and facilitating the formation of 3D tissue structures (Mattei et al., 2019). This technology enhances nutrient utilization by cells/tissues and promotes their development; however, it necessitates a high rotation rate. Excessive rotation speed can cause damage to cells and tissues, while insufficient rotation speed may result in tissue/cell sedimentation, thereby limiting growth and development (Ryu et al., 2019).",
        "The research conducted by He et al. (2022) demonstrated the successful construction of a HBOs using liver cells through the technique of rotational cultivation. Initially, liver cells were differentiated into hollow hepatocyte-like organoids (HHOs) using matrix gel embedding technology. Subsequently, these HHOs were placed in a rotating bioreactor with a flowing suspension environment to optimize nutrient absorption and facilitate progenitor cell self-assembly into functional HBOs. As the application of rotational cultivation techniques in the field of biliary tract continues to advance, it is imperative to carefully select appropriate rotational cultivation conditions for constructing biliary tract-like organs, including adjusting rotation speed, optimizing culture medium composition, and incorporating specific growth factors.",
        "That is, by inverting the cell suspension droplet and using its surface tension and gravity to aggregate cells/tissues into cell spheres at the liquid-eob-gas interface (Sun et al., 2021). This technology can generate a large number of three-dimensional cell spheres of the same size in a short time, which is suitable for industrial production. However, due to the limited volume of droplets, the size of cell spheres produced is relatively small (Zhou et al., 2023).",
        "The hanging drop culture technique facilitates the formation of three-dimensional structures that closely replicate the arrangement and function of biliary cells in vivo. However, it is important to note that the intricacies observed in vivo may not be fully replicated in terms of extracellular matrix formation and distribution. Furthermore, there might be significant differences in mechanical stress experienced by biliary cells between in vitro and in vivo environments, potentially impacting the normal physiological characteristics of bile duct-like organs. Therefore, researchers should continuously optimize culture conditions, refine techniques, and explore novel biomaterials and methodologies to enhance both quality and functionality when constructing bile duct-like organs (Ohguro et al., 2024). Currently, this technique primarily finds application within kidney-like or testicular-like organ systems (Parigoris et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2022).",
        "The mixture of magnetic particles/nanoparticles is utilized for cellular magnetization and enhancement of intercellular interaction forces, thereby facilitating cell aggregation into clusters to form cellular spheres (Marques et al., 2022). This technology not only enables control over the geometry of the cellular sphere through magnetic fields but also facilitates co-culturing different types of cells. However, it does not substitute the need for a cell medium and presents challenges in controlling cell size, which limits its applicability (Tepe et al., 2023).",
        "Magnetic levitation cultivation technology can provide a three-dimensional growth environment similar to in vivo conditions, enabling contact-free cell growth and minimizing mechanical stress-induced damage between bile duct cells and the culture surface. This promotes the development of intricate bile duct structures (El Harane et al., 2023). However, due to equipment and technical limitations, magnetic levitation cultivation technology is not suitable for long-term cultivation of biliary organs as it lacks efficient removal of metabolic waste and toxins. Nonetheless, this technique has general applicability in salivary gland-like organoids and adipose organoids (Daquinag et al., 2013; Ferreira et al., 2019).",
        "The process of forming cell spheres using 96-well plates and 384-well plates, which meet the requirements for high-throughput three-dimensional culture (Xing et al., 2024), is referred to as “exclusion of seed cells through ultra-low adsorption materials, resulting in their aggregation into spherical structures.” This technique is characterized by its operational simplicity and ability to generate large-scale cell spheres with uniform diameters while allowing control over sphere size by adjusting the number of seed cells. However, it still faces challenges associated with a high coefficient of variation (Ryu et al., 2019).",
        "Kim et al. (2023) employed ultra-low attachment culture technology to fabricate a HBOs that possesses both vascular and biliary systems. The vascular system generates perfusable microvessels with lumens, enabling the organoid to mimic liver diseases mediated by interactions between parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells, exhibiting promising applications (Kim et al., 2023). The ultra-low attachment culture technology facilitates co-culture of biliary epithelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells, fostering cell-cell interactions and signaling transduction, recapitulating the arrangement of bile duct cells akin to normal tissue, and forming intricate bile duct-like structures with tremendous potential for application. However, the ability of bile duct epithelial cells to adhere to and receive signals such as growth factors, cytokines, and hormones is limited in long-term culture, which may affect their survival rate and physiological function (Acharya et al., 2024). Moreover, physiological data derived from bile duct organoids generated using ultra-low attachment culture technology diverge from those obtained through alternative culturing methods such as embedding techniques, thereby augmenting the complexity in analyzing diverse outcomes (Acharya et al., 2024).",
        "Traditional cultural technology presents certain drawbacks in the construction of biliary organoids, including a lengthy processing cycle, high costs, and limited morphological design. These limitations can be overcome by employing novel construction methods such as organ-on-a-chip (OOC), 3D, and 4D printing technologies. These advanced techniques enable rapid production of complex organoids with high-throughput and exceptional accuracy (Hockney et al., 2023).",
        "The term OOC refers to the utilization of microfluidic chips for constructing a physiologically relevant microenvironment that encompasses various living cells, functional tissue interfaces, mechanical force stimulation through biological fluids, and more (Deng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Nasiri et al., 2024). This technology enhances mechanical stimulation by integrating biomaterial technology, microfluidic technology, and tissue engineering techniques to precisely regulate multiple system parameters and provide real-time display of diverse functional data associated with tissue and organ function. Consequently, it holds significant application value in the fields of organoid construction, drug screening, and personalized precision medicine (Baptista et al., 2024; Palasantzas et al., 2023). Organoids cultivated within OOC systems exhibit high fidelity in simulating anatomical structures as well as physiological/pathological states of tissues/organs; thus representing a promising culture methodology (Shoji et al., 2023).",
        "The biliary epithelium has been utilized by Du et al. (2020) to fabricate bile duct-like organs with a tubular structure and barrier function through the application of organ chip technology. This innovative organ model provides a robust in vitro platform for investigating biliary pathophysiology, allowing independent access to the apical and lateral surfaces of the biliary epithelial cell channels. In 2024, they further advanced their research by integrating a vascular system into the bile duct-like organ using organ chip technology (Du et al., 2023). The biliary epithelial cells within these organs exhibit polarization within the channels, forming mature tight junctions and demonstrating permeability levels comparable to those observed in vivo systems. Researchers can investigate distinct reactions between biliary epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells towards varying flows of perfused blood and bile inside these lined channels. OOC technology can simulate the microenvironment of the biliary tract, including cellular arrangement, fluid dynamics, and physical stimuli. This provides a more physiologically relevant culture environment for biliary organoids. Additionally, it allows for co-culturing different cell types in the biliary tract, facilitating research on interactions and signaling between constituent cells and enhancing the physiological relevance of biliary organoids. The use of organ-chip technology for a complete analysis of specific mechanisms of the biliary tract is good. However, since all human systems are interconnected, the body-on-a-chip concept should be further developed to evaluate the whole system, that is, the interactions between multiple organs, the mechanisms of cell migration, and the cell signaling processes between them (Koyilot et al., 2022).",
        "3D printing technology refers to the utilization of computer-aided design for the fabrication of intricate bioactive tissue/organ structures by printing biocompatible materials, cells, and biomolecules (Kantaros, 2022). This technology offers advantages such as cost-effectiveness, high material utilization rate, a straightforward and convenient process, and customization capabilities for organoids. It is a comprehensive technology with significant personalization potential, offering a high degree of freedom and precision (Assad et al., 2023; Jing et al., 2023). While 3D printing excels in manufacturing static structures, it falls short in simulating the dynamic behavior observed in natural tissues and organs (Mandal and Chatterjee, 2024).On the other hand, 4D printing is an additive manufacturing technique that builds upon 3D printing by incorporating time as the fourth dimension. By subjecting the structure to one or more stimuli, it enables transition into a state of dynamic equilibrium (Kalogeropoulou et al., 2024; Wan et al., 2024). With its ability to fabricate highly complex biological structures effectively addressing some limitations of 3D printing, 4D printing holds great promise for revolutionizing tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM).",
        "Lee et al. (2019) employed 3D printing technology to create a HBOs, using decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) bioink derived from the liver along with vascular/biliary fluid channels that closely resemble the blood vessels and biliary system. This organ model demonstrates both the functionality of a bile duct system and specific gene expression of the liver, making it a promising platform for in vitro drug screening (Lee et al., 2019). The rapid advancement of 3D printing technology has enabled the construction of highly intricate three-dimensional models that closely mirror the structural and physiological characteristics of bile duct organs. These models offer superior cell arrangement and spatial organization, significantly enhancing research accuracy and effectiveness. Moreover, the personalized nature of 3D printing allows for tailored bile duct organ models based on individual patient conditions, which is crucial for disease study and treatment plan development. However, practical applications of 3D printing technology still face challenges such as limited cell growth and differentiation on printed scaffolds due to material compatibility issues that can impact organ development. Furthermore, precise equipment and techniques are required to adjust and control environmental conditions like temperature, pH value, oxygen concentration etc., during 3D cultivation.",
        "The utilization of 4D printing technology presents new prospects for constructing biliary organs, enabling them to adapt and modulate their functionalities in response to external stimuli such as temperature, pH, or humidity variations. This augmentation enhances their physiological relevance. By employing intelligent responsive materials, 4D printing not only mimics the growth and repair processes of biliary ducts but also provides a platform for researchers to observe cellular reactions under diverse conditions, thus generating more realistic biological response models (Chadwick et al., 2020; Li et al., 2024b). However, 4D printing technology imposes relatively high material requirements and necessitates the use of smart materials with precise reaction capabilities to effectively adapt to intricate dynamic changes in biological environments. Simultaneously, it is crucial to enhance the accuracy of 4D printing technology to ensure microstructural consistency. Currently, challenges persist regarding technology and materials when it comes to manufacturing intricate and dynamically responsive biliary organiods. Table 1 presents common techniques employed in organoid construction.",
        "Several common organ construction techniques.",
        "Abbreviations: PDMS, polydimethylsiloxane; ICOs, intrahepatic biliary organoids; ECOs, Extrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids; GCOs, gallbladder biliary organoids; HBOs, hepatobiliary organoids; Tubuloids, basal-in and apical-out proximal tubule organoids; TOs, testicular organoids; MOs, mammary organoids; SGLOs, salivary gland-like organoids; Aos, adipose organoids; BOs, biliary organoids; GPDOs, glioblastoma patient derived organoids-like.",
        "The biliary organoids can be named based on their cell of origin, cell type, or anatomical structure. Ary Marsee proposed a reliable nomenclature method that categorizes biliary tract organoids into three types: intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids (ICOs), Extrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids (ECOs) and gallbladder cholangiocyte organoids (GCOs) (Marsee et al., 2021). The nomenclature proposed by Marsee et al. (2021) provides a systematic framework for classifying and describing biliary organoids, enabling researchers to adopt uniform terminology in their discussions and communications. This standardization significantly reduces confusion in scientific communication and establishes a clear foundation for subsequent research. Building upon the nomenclature of Marsee et al. (2021) the authors introduced HBOs as a category based on the biological characteristics of biliary organoids, providing support for further development of related research. The various types of biliary organoids are illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "Types of biliary organoids. LPCs, liver progenitor cells; iPSCs, Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; HHOs, hollow hepatocyte organoids; HEPSs, hepatoblast spheroids; ICOs, intrahepatic biliary organoids; ECOs, extrahepatic biliary organoids; GCOs, gallbladder biliary organoids; HBOs, Hepatobiliary organoids.",
        "Intrahepatic bile duct organoids have significant potential for various applications, including mechanistic research on biliary tract diseases, drug screening, and regenerative medicine (Rodrigues and Banales, 2021). Typically, these organoids are constructed using intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells. Huch et al. (2015) utilized intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells to generate ICOs that expressed key markers of biliary epithelial cells such as cytokeratin markers KRT19 and KRT7. Moreover, these ICOs could be subcultured in a stable manner, providing a valuable experimental platform for disease modeling, toxicology research, regenerative medicine, and gene therapy targeting the intrahepatic bile duct (Huch et al., 2015). Additionally, hiPSCs also hold potential for constructing intrahepatic bile duct organoids. Carolina et al. (2024) successfully generated ICOs by co-culturing hiPSCs with blood vessels (BVS) composed of immature smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. These ICOs exhibited characteristics resembling those of bile duct epithelial cells including intercellular junctions, microvilli on the apical membrane, and bile secretion function (Carolina et al., 2024). Transplantation of these ICOs onto the liver surface of cholestatic mice demonstrated their ability to temporarily alleviate cholestasis symptoms while showcasing promising prospects for regenerative medicine in the field of the biliary tract.",
        "Epithelial cells derived from the extrahepatic bile ducts can be expanded and cultured in vitro to generate ECOs that exhibit transcriptional and functional characteristics consistent with those of cholangiocytes. Sampaziotis et al. (2017) generated ECOs using the embedding culture technique. They isolated biliary cells from mechanically dissected extrahepatic bile ducts and cultured them with EGF, R-spondin, and Wnt inhibitor (DKK-1). The resulting ECOs exhibited ultrastructural features, including cilia, microvilli, and tight junctions. These organoids expressed biliary markers such as KRT7, KRT19, nuclear hepatocyte factor (NHF) 1β, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), secretin receptor (SCTR), Sodium/cholic acid cotransporter (SLC10A2), CFTR, and SRY-box9 (SOX9). Notably, the expression of SLC10A2 as a biliary marker remains controversial due to its known expression in intestinal epithelial cells of the terminal ileum (Zhou et al., 2014). Moreover, the ECOs could be efficiently cultured within 24 h and expanded through multiple passages while retaining their original properties. This not only provides a novel cell source for biliary disease cell therapy but also offers a new model for studying the extrahepatic bile duct. The study conducted by Verstegen et al. (2020) demonstrated the successful establishment of both ECOs and ICOs. Both types of organs showed similarities in terms of biliary epithelial cell biomarkers, gene expression profiles, proliferative capacity, and functional characteristics. However, unlike ICOs, ECOs did not undergo differentiation into hepatocyte-like cells. This indicates that there are distinct differences in the potential for differentiation between ECOs and ICOs.",
        "The gallbladder can serve as a source for isolating stem/progenitor cells, which can be successfully cultured in vitro over an extended period of time to generate GCOs that exhibit a remarkably similar structure and partially retain gallbladder functionality. Lugli et al. (2016) employed culture technology to construct GCOs using embedding techniques. They minced the extrahepatic bile duct and gallbladder from 2-month-old mice, incubated them in PBS containing EDTA at 4°C for 2 h to generate a small cell mass before embedding it into Matrigel matrix gel. The resulting GCOs constructs were further cultivated in serum-free medium supplemented with nicotinamide and various growth factors (including EGF, FGF 10, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), R-spondin-1 and Transcriptional active morphogenetic protein pathway inhibitor (noggin). This led to the final formation of GCOs that expressed gallbladder markers such as CLDN3, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM), protruding protein 1, and integrin α6. These GCOs serve as an excellent research model with significant implications for studying liver and biliary tract diseases.",
        "Hepatocytes have the ability to undergo dedifferentiation into LPCs, which can subsequently redifferentiate into both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes during liver development. Therefore, hepatocytes can be utilized for HBOs that contains both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes (Yimlamai et al., 2014). He et al. (2022) developed an HBO using embedding culture technology and rotary culture technology, based on hepatocyte dedifferentiation into LPCs. The resulting HBO expressed NHF4A as a marker for hepatocyte differentiation and KRT19 as a marker for bile duct epithelial cell differentiation, with electron microscopy revealing the presence of both hepatocyte and bile duct structures within the HBO. This platform holds great potential for studying liver development, regenerative medicine, and diseases (He et al., 2022).",
        "Furthermore, various types of stem/progenitor cells including human chemically induced liver progenitor cells (hCLiPs), iPSCs, and hESCs have the potential to differentiate into hepatobiliary organoids. Li et al. (2024a) employed ultra-low adsorption culture technology to establish an hCLiP-derived HBO, which exhibited functional bile ducts, bile duct connections, and mature hepatocytes (MHs). By conducting Rh123 assay and cholyllysyl fluorescein (CLF) dye assay, they demonstrated that this hepatobiliary organoid possessed bile secretion and transport functions, making it a promising model for investigating hepatobiliary diseases, drug screening, and personalized medicine (Li et al., 2024a). Ramli et al. (2020) successfully generated a similar type of HBOs by co-culturing iPSCs and hESCs with matrigel embedding technology. This organoid expressed biomarkers characteristic of both hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells; normal secretion of albumin and apolipoprotein B by hepatocytes was observed; cytochrome P450 activity remained unaltered; gamma-glutamyltransferase activity in bile duct epithelial cells as well as alkaline phosphatase activity were within normal range; proliferative response to pancreatotropin was also maintained. These features render it a valuable platform for HBOs research.",
        "The biliary organoids are primarily utilized for disease modeling, mechanism research, drug screening, tissue/organ repair, and other related aspects.",
        "BA is a fibroinflammatory disease characterized by congenital intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary obstruction, leading to impaired bile discharge and subsequent liver damage. It can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure, posing a life-threatening risk to children (Zhu et al., 2023). The pathogenesis of BA-induced liver fibrosis remains unknown; however, studies have suggested potential associations with functional abnormalities such as activation of the TWEAK/FN14 signaling pathway, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), β-amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation, matrix collagen deposition, apical-basal cell polarity disorder, and primary ciliary dysfunction (Deng et al., 2011; Glessner et al., 2023; Lendahl et al., 2021; Short et al., 2023). Although various methods like drug toxicant induction, surgical induction (mechanical biliary duct ligation), rotavirus induction, gene recombination are used for establishing animal models of BA disease; they have limitations including complex procedures, high costs, and long duration. Utilizing biliary organoids offers an efficient and rapid approach for establishing BA disease models.",
        "Chen et al. (2020) successfully generated a biliary organoid using the embedding culture techniques and co-cultured it with rotavirus to establish a disease model of BA. They observed that rotavirus induced lesions in biliary cells through virus-host interaction, leading to the development of BA. Furthermore, it is suggested that inhibiting rotavirus growth and neutralizing antibodies against the rotavirus VP7 protein could be potential treatments for BA (Chen et al., 2020). Amarachintha et al. (2022) constructed BA organoids (BACOs) by embedding biliary tract cells derived from patients with BA in matrigel. Human liver tissue was minced, washed twice with ice-cold DMEM/F12 basal medium, filtered through a 0.1 mm filter membrane, mixed with a low growth factor matrix glue, and then transferred into a 24-well culture plate with 50 uL per well. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 10 min before adding 50 uL of separation medium for culture. On the fifth day, BACOs were prepared by supplementing them with B27 (1x), N2 (1x), R-spondin 1, A83-01, vitamin A, N-acetylcysteine, nicotinamide, recombinant human gastrin, recombinant human EGF, recombinant human FGF10, recombinant human HGF, and forskolin. They found significantly decreased expression levels of markers related to biliary tract development such as KRT7, EpCAM, aquaporin 1 (AQP1), CFTR and somatostatin receptor2(SSTR2) through immunohistochemical staining in BACOs.",
        "Biliary tract tumors typically refer to primary tumors of the biliary tract system, which are categorized as benign or malignant. The main malignant tumors of the biliary tract include gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Currently, various disease models exist for GBC, such as 2D and 3D cell cultures, xenograft models, and 3D bio-printing models; however, there are few reports on organoid disease models for gallbladder cancer (Xing et al., 2023). Cholangiocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor that develops in the epithelial cells of the biliary tract. Based on anatomical location, it can be classified as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICCA), perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PCCA), or distal cholangiocarcinoma (DCCA) (Brindley et al., 2021; Loeuillard et al., 2019a; Loeuillard et al., 2019b). Disease models for CCA are typically established in experimental animals using chemical induction, tumor transplantation, biliary stasis, parasitic infection or genetic engineering methods; however these approaches have some disadvantages such as low controllability and high cost with low success rates (Calvisi et al., 2023; Domènech Omella et al., 2023). CCA organoids retain most histological and genetic characteristics while demonstrating high stability during in vitro culture providing a novel approach to study biliary tract cancer (Nuciforo and Heim, 2021).",
        "Zhou et al. (2022) minced liver specimens obtained from patients with CCA and incubated the resulting digest at 37°C for 2–5 h to obtain a suspension. This suspension was then filtered through a 100 μm nylon cell filter, followed by centrifugation at 300 to 400 RPM for 5 min. The resulting cryoprecipitate was washed in advanced DMEM/F12 (GIBCO) medium. Subsequently, it was mixed with basement membrane extract type II (BME) and seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2,000 to 5,000 cells per well. The culture medium was supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, glutamate, HEPES, B27 supplement, N2 supplement, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), nicotinamide, recombinant human gastrin I, recombinant human EGF, recombinant human FGF10, recombinant human HGF, forskolin, A8301, ROCK inhibitor Y27632, and dexamethasone. A CCA organoid model was successfully constructed (Zhou et al., 2022). Maier et al. (2021) reported a protocol for establishing stable CCA organoids by embedding culture techniques. The digested mixture was initially filtered through filters ranging from 40 to 100 um, followed by differential centrifugation at 200 r/min for 3 min. The isolated cells and cytokines were then seeded in matrigel. Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), forskolin, insulin, transferrin, and selenite were added to the culture medium to establish stable CCA organoids. These aforementioned models can be utilized for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying CCA disease as well as translational research on this condition, providing an innovative platform for studying CCA disease (Maier et al., 2021).",
        "PSC refers to a chronic hepatobiliary disease whose origin is unknown. It is characterized by the presence of multiple strictures in both internal and external biliary tracts. ERCP angiography reveals a distinctive “dead branch” pattern that indicates chronic inflammation and progressive fibrosis within the structure of the biliary tract. Eventually, this condition may lead to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease; some cases are also associated with biliary malignancy (Reich et al., 2021). Experimental animal models are commonly used for studying PSC through genetic engineering, chemical induction, bacterial induction or other methods. However, it can be challenging to investigate disease progression under different external environments; nonetheless, organoid disease models effectively address this limitation.",
        "Zhang et al. (2023) presented a method for constructing PSC organoids, in which PSC liver tissue was initially fragmented into small pieces (<3 mm). Subsequently, the tissue was incubated with collagenase-containing buffer for 30–40 min, followed by centrifugation of the resulting suspension at 44°C and 200 r/min for 3 min. The cell precipitation was then washed thrice with minimal essential medium to resuspend it. Fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS) was employed to enrich extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary cells. After positive immunostaining of cytokeratin (CK)19, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 medium (1:1) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin-streptomycin (1%), Adenine (100 umol/L), insulin (5 ug/mL), epinephrine (1 ug/mL), T3-T transferrin (8 ug/mL), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/mL), and hydrocortisone (600 ng/mL) to establish a PSA organoid (Zhang et al., 2023). This novel in vitro disease model of PSA provides an opportunity to investigate the pathophysiology of PSC as well as potential treatment options. Du et al. (2023) on the other hand, developed a vascularized bile duct on-a-chip (PVBDOC)-based PSC organoid using organ chip technology. The expression profile of cytokines such as biliary cell markers, polarity markers, collagen IV, laminin, bile salt transporter ASBT, secretin receptor SCTR and tight junction component ZO-1 in this disease model is consistent with that observed in biliary cells of PSC; thus making it an advantageous tool for studying both physiological and pathological mechanisms underlying PSC (Du et al., 2023). In recent years, Jalan-Sakrikar et al. (2022) reprogrammed fibroblasts from patients with PSC to obtain hiPSCs which were subsequently cultured in three dimensions leading to formation of a PSC organoid. They utilized this advanced model system effectively elucidating the pathological structure and characteristics associated with PSC thereby highlighting its immense potential as a valuab. In summary, biliary organoids can more accurately reflect the complexity and dynamic changes of the disease, providing a solid platform for disease modeling research on primary sclerosing cholangitis. Through in-depth investigation into the disease mechanism and drug screening for primary sclerosing cholangitis, it is expected to offer novel approaches for future treatment and prevention of the disease.",
        "Biliary tract diseases impact the structure of the biliary tract through various pathophysiological mechanisms. However, current 2D cell models fail to accurately replicate the intricate architecture and precise cellular localization within the biliary tract. Moreover, controlling the size of the biliary tract and positioning cells is challenging using these models. In contrast, organoids possess distinctive spatial organization and cell specificity, making them capable of achieving tissue regeneration and restoring a majority of original organ functions. Consequently, they serve as an ideal research platform for investigating both physiological and pathological mechanisms underlying biliary tract disorders.",
        "Jalan-Sakrikar et al. (2022) reprogrammed fibroblasts from patients with PSC to generate hiPSCs, which were then utilized to construct a biliary organoid through three-dimensional culture. By employing electron microscopy, they investigated the anatomical features of the organoid and observed its small size, absence of a central lumen, and accelerated aging. Furthermore, they identified disease-specific characteristics of PSC by detecting an upregulation in the secretion of extracellular matrix molecules (fibronectin), inflammatory cytokine IL-6, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2. Amarachintha et al. (2022) successfully generated BACOs using liver tissue obtained from infants. The researchers employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the physiological and anatomical structure of BACOs and noted a limited number of ciliated cells exhibiting lateral growth of cilia, potentially attributed to reduced levels of F-actin, β-catenin, and ezrin protein secretion (Amarachintha et al., 2022). In addition, decreased expression of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) was observed in biliary epithelial cells within BACOs leading to compromised barrier function and increased permeability. Moreover, activation of the EGF/FGFs signal transduction pathway was demonstrated to enhance epithelial cell differentiation as well as improve biliary epithelial barrier function in these cholangiocyte organoids (Amarachintha et al., 2022). The cystic fibrosis ECOs established by Verstegen et al. (2020) demonstrated normal chloride channel and MDR1 transporter activity, but showed a loss of CFTR channel activity. These studies underscore the crucial role played by biliary organoids as a visualization platform for investigating internal metabolism and regulatory mechanisms within the biliary system.",
        "Currently, the commonly employed drug screening models primarily consist of two-dimensional cell models and human tumor xenograft models. However, these disease models exhibit limited accuracy in assessing drug efficacy due to disparities between the culture environment and in vivo conditions, as well as physiological variations across species. Organoids can effectively mimic drug sensitivity and resistance patterns within solid tissues, offering a short preparation cycle and stable passaging capability. Consequently, they hold significant potential for high-throughput drug screening (Magré et al., 2023; Yang and Yu, 2023).",
        "Utilizing embedding culture technique, Yuan et al. (2022) successfully generated a GBC organoid and employed it to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of CUDC-907, a dual PI3K/HDAC inhibitor, against GBC. The results demonstrated significant inhibition of GBC growth by CUDC-907 with minimal toxicity towards normal biliary epithelial cells compared to other anticancer drugs. These findings underscore the potential of biliary organoids as drug screening platforms. Ren et al. (2023) also established an organoid model for patients with CCA using embedding culture technology with a high success rate. Researchers evaluated and documented the therapeutic effects of seven commonly used chemotherapy drugs, including gemcitabine, cisplatin, capecitabine/5-fluorouracil (5-FU), SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), oxaliplatin, mitomycin C, and paclitaxel on this model. Subsequently, they compared these results with follow-up outcomes in CCA patients as well as therapeutic effects observed in CCA models in mice. Consistent drug response patterns were observed between these comparisons, further validating biliary organoids as reliable and efficient platforms for drug screening. Wang et al. established an organoid model for DCCA and used it to compare the inhibitory effects of six drugs: gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, paclitaxel, infelatinib, and ivociclib (Wang et al., 2021). The results demonstrated that gemcitabine exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect on DCCA and emerged as the most effective therapeutic option. Saito et al. (2019) established a robust organoid system for CCA through drug screening, in which the antifungal drugs amorolofine and fenteconazole exhibited significant growth inhibition of CCA-derived organoids. Importantly, these drugs demonstrated minimal toxicity towards normal biliary epithelial cells. Furthermore, analysis of the gene expression profile in these organoids identified SOX2 as a potential prognostic biomarker for CCA patients, offering valuable insights into targeted gene therapy and disease prognosis.",
        "Chen et al. (2024) established a PSC organoid and demonstrated that exosomes derived from human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ExoMSC) ameliorate the hypersecretory phenotype and cell-cell interactions in the hepatic Th17 microenvironment by regulating PERK/CHOP signaling, thereby reducing hepatic fibrosis in PSC. The therapeutic potential of ExoMSC has been confirmed. Nakamoto et al. (2019) developed a bacteria-PSC organoid co-culture system and revealed that Klebsiella pneumoniae mediates hepatobiliary injury through the TH17 pathway. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment was found to improve the TH17 immune response induced by PSC-derived microbiota, providing valuable insights into the treatment strategy for PSC (Nakamoto et al., 2019). The results suggest that biliary organoids can be a powerful research tool for drug screening, as they can elucidate the molecular pathogenesis and discover biomarkers for refractory diseases. Table 2 presents organoid models and their applications in common refractory bile duct diseases.",

        "Clinically, bile duct injury can occur following abdominal trauma, cholecystectomy, hepatectomy, or liver transplantation and may also arise as a complication of ERCP. The standard surgical treatment is typically categorized based on the severity of bile duct injury. Bile duct repair can be performed for mild injuries, while hepatobiliary anastomosis or pancreaticobiliary anastomosis is often utilized for severe injuries. Additionally, endoscopic stent placement may be employed to ensure biliary tract patency (Cho et al., 2018; de’Angelis et al., 2021; Omar et al., 2023). Biliary organoids exhibit remarkable stability and excellent biocompatibility, making them a promising alternative for the management of biliary tract injuries in the field of biliary regenerative medicine. Before initiating clinical trials in the field of biliary regenerative medicine, researchers must gather substantial evidence from preclinical investigations to ensure the safety and efficacy of biliary organoids. This involves conducting long-term observations in animal models, thoroughly assessing the origin of biological materials and cells, as well as establishing clear indications for designing clinical study protocols (Huang et al., 2021). Clinical trials should specifically focus on biliary diseases such as biliary obstruction, cholangiocarcinoma, and refractory conditions associated with bile duct dysfunction (De Assuncao et al., 2017; Tam et al., 2024). The clinical trials involving biliary organoids in regenerative medicine should adopt a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design that encompasses evaluating the design phase and collecting and analyzing data to ensure scientific validity. Furthermore, after patients receive treatment, it is essential to conduct long-term follow-up to gather data on efficacy and side effects so that these findings can contribute towards forming scientific evaluation reports that guide subsequent studies and applications (Soroka et al., 2021).",
        "In 2017, Sampaziotis conducted an experiment using extrahepatic biliary cells to create engineered ECOs. These ECOs were transplanted under the renal capsule of immunodeficient mice and demonstrated robust growth and development, resembling a conduit structure with high similarity to the biliary tract. Furthermore, they expressed specific markers associated with biliary cells (Sampaziotis et al., 2017). Additionally, the researchers seeded ECOs onto a biodegradable scaffold, resulting in the formation of a tissue-like structure that retained key features of bile ducts. This study provides a solid foundation for regenerative medicine applications targeting the biliary tract. X Yang utilized 3D printing technology to fabricate an artificial bile duct incorporating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which was subsequently transplanted into pigs while monitoring its progress through MR Imaging (Xiang et al., 2020). After 14 days, histological examination confirmed that the morphology and structure of the artificial bile duct remained normal based on HE staining. Immunohistochemical staining revealed expression of CK19 as a marker for bile ducts, indicating successful repair and regeneration of the damaged bile duct. This achievement represents an initial step towards restoring functionality in diseased or injured bile ducts. In the future, further investigation should be conducted on the application of artificial bile ducts in refractory biliary diseases such as cholangiocarcinoma and bile duct stenosis. This aims to explore the reparative and regenerative potential of artificial bile ducts across different disease conditions. In recent years, Sampaziotis et al. (2021) further advanced their research by utilizing primary human extrahepatic biliary tract cells to construct ECOs. Through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, they discovered mechanisms involving transcriptional diversity loss and recovery within these cells (Sampaziotis et al., 2021). Moreover, in an ex vivo human liver model with normothermic perfusion system, they successfully implanted ECOs into injured intrahepatic biliary tracts. The transplanted biliary cells effectively modulated bile composition and pH levels while exhibiting normal physiological function (Amarachintha et al., 2022). These findings demonstrate significant potential for utilizing biliary organoids. Biliary tract organoids have demonstrated significant research potential in the field of regenerative medicine, providing novel insights and methodologies for refractory biliary tract diseases and liver-related disorders by investigating the mechanisms of bile duct injury repair.",
        "The application of organoid technology in biliary tissue research offers a comprehensive understanding of its cellular and molecular biology, as well as the underlying mechanisms involved in pathogenesis and tumorigenesis. This emerging field holds immense potential for disease modeling, drug screening, regenerative medicine, and investigating physiological and pathological processes. However, it is important to acknowledge that this technology is still in its early stages with certain limitations. Firstly, biliary organoids currently lack the complexity observed in human organs. Additionally, being an in vitro model of the biliary tract restricts their ability to study multi-organ system interactions within the human body, limiting their applicability for exploring physiological and pathological mechanisms comprehensively. Secondly, biliary organoids primarily focus on mimicking only the epithelial component of the organ while lacking crucial physiological conditions such as vascular systems, immune environments, tumor microenvironments (TME), resulting in low long-term cell and tissue survival rates. Consequently, they fail to fully replicate the intricate complexities and cell-to-cell interactions found within natural tissues. Lastly but importantly, there remains a lack of standardization regarding construction methods for biliary organoids. Current research mainly focuses on cultivating these organoids from different species without clear guidelines or regulations concerning size, shape or gene expression levels - leading to high variability among generated organoids which poses challenges during passage procedures and high-throughput drug screening applications; ultimately impeding efficient research progress and clinical translation (Hu and Lazar, 2022).",
        "Future research should prioritize the following aspects: standardizing culture procedures and implementing unified quality control standards to enhance the consistency and reproducibility of organoid construction (Hu et al., 2023). In terms of standardized culture procedures for biliary tract organoids, it is essential for researchers to clearly specify the types of seed cells involved, such as biliary epithelial cells, iPSCs, and hepatic progenitor cells. Additionally, they should establish standardized protocols for cell acquisition and processing. Furthermore, appropriate three-dimensional culture technologies like embedding culture technology, rotating culture technology, and organ chip culture technology should be selected. The parameters of the cell culture environment need to be precisely defined and a detailed schedule for the entire culture process should be formulated. Moreover, methods need to be developed in order to assess the functionality of biliary organoids including bile secretion capacity, cell proliferation rate, and multilineage differentiation potential. Quality control standards must also be established through regular evaluations of both the quality of cells used and the composition of the culture medium employed. Standardization in all aspects of culturing operations is crucial, while specific verification criteria should be devised for biliary tract organoids. Furthermore, continuous evaluation of both cultural effects and quality control measures is necessary to ensure that final biliary tract organoids possess desirable biological characteristics. Lastly but importantly, establishing a comprehensive database dedicated solely to biliary organoids would provide invaluable data support for future research endeavors while simultaneously promoting their application and development. Utilizing bioreactors can improve nutrient transportation and metabolic waste removal in organoids, thereby extending their lifespan (Rimal et al., 2024). Co-culturing seed cells with vascular endothelial cells or their progenitors can promote angiogenesis and increase organoid survival rate (Rimal et al., 2024). Organ-on-a-chip technology enables the cultivation of 3D vascularized organoids, facilitating flux generation, vascularization formation, interaction between organoids, and control over tissue microenvironment. This advancement is crucial for guiding stem cell growth, differentiation, morphogenesis of organoids, as well as overcoming existing limitations in this field of research (Du et al., 2020; Monteduro et al., 2023). The co-cultivation of seed cells and mesenchymal cells can enhance the differentiation and maturation of biliary organoids. Additionally, supplementing the medium with R-spondin and DKK-1 can provide paracrine signals to induce cell differentiation and facilitate the formation of a three-dimensional structure in biliary organoids (Ock et al., 2023). With continuous advancements in organoid technology, biliary tract organoids will play an increasingly significant role in related fields.",

    "title": "Regenerative endodontics: a review of current status and a call for action. treatment modalities offer high levels of success for many conditions, an ideal form of therapy might consist of regenerative approaches in which diseased or necrotic pulp tissues are removed and replaced with healthy pulp tissue to revitalize teeth. Researchers are working toward this objective. Regenerative endodontics is the creation and delivery of tissues to replace diseased, missing, and traumatized pulp. This review provides an overview of regenerative endodontics and its goals, and describes possible techniques that will allow regenerative endodontics to become a reality. These potential approaches include root-canal revascularization, postnatal (adult) stem cell therapy, pulp implant, scaffold implant, three-dimensional cell printing, injectable scaffolds, and gene therapy. These regenerative endodontic techniques will possibly involve some combination of disinfection or debridement of infected root canal systems with apical enlargement to permit revascularization and use of adult stem cells, scaffolds, and growth factors. Although the challenges of introducing endodontic tissue engineering therapies are substantial, the potential benefits to patients and the profession are equally ground breaking. Patient demand is staggering both in scope and cost, because tissue engineering therapy offers the possibility of restoring natural function instead of surgical placement of an artificial prosthesis. By providing an overview of the methodological issues required to develop potential regenerative endodontic therapies, we hope to present a call for action to develop these therapies for clinical use.

This research compares the efficacy of traditional blood clots and advanced platelet-rich fibrin (A-PRF) as scaffolds for the regeneration of injured nonvital immature teeth. Materials and Methods: This randomized clinical experiment comprised 30 injured nonvital immature maxillary incisors from 24 kids between the ages of 8 and 12. The canals were irrigated with 1.5% sodium hypochlorite and 17% EDTA after minor mechanical debridement. For disinfection, calcium hydroxide paste was used. Two sets of teeth—A-PRF (n = 15) and conventional blood clot (n = 15)—were assigned at random. At baseline, three, six, and 12 months, radiographic measurements were made of the root development parameters, such as apical breadth, root length, and root thickness. To evaluate changes over time both within and across groups, statistical analyses were conducted. Results: The investigation was finished by 28 teeth (A-PRF: n = 14, blood clot: n = 14). After a year, teeth treated with A-PRF had a greater increase in root length (18.5% vs. 12.2%), root thickness (15.4% vs. 11.6%), and a decrease in apical width (11.3% vs. 8.1%) than the blood clot group. Nevertheless, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups ( P > 0.05). For the length of the trial, none of the patients in either group had any symptoms. Conclusion: A-PRF and traditional blood clot scaffolds both showed significant enhancements in REP root growth. A-PRF demonstrated marginally better results and is especially helpful when it comes to difficult bleeding induction or when there is a danger of close proximity to critical structures.",

        "With the goal of restoring the pulp–dentin complex and encouraging root development, regenerative endodontic treatments (REPs) mark a paradigm change in the treatment of immature necrotic teeth. REPs take use of the potential for biological healing and regeneration, in contrast to conventional apexification techniques that depend on prolonged calcium hydroxide treatment or artificial apical barriers made of materials, like mineral trioxide aggregate.[12] A key component of REPs is the use of scaffolds, which promote cellular proliferation and differentiation inside the root canal system when combined with disinfection and stem cell mobilization.[3]",
        "The effectiveness of many scaffolds, including platelet-rich plasma (PRP), platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), and the traditional blood clot, has been studied in REPs.[45] The conventional option has been a blood clot created by artificially inducing bleeding into the canal. However, when the root apex is small or close to important structures, it may be difficult to achieve regular and sufficient bleeding.[6] A possible substitute is platelet-rich fibrin, especially its advanced variant (A-PRF). In addition to acting as a scaffold, A-PRF also releases growth factors that promote angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).[7]",

The A-PRF group showed a mean reduction of 9.8% at 12 months, compared to 7.5% in the blood clot group. While the A-PRF group had better outcomes, the difference between groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.05, Table 3).",
        "Changes in apical width (%) over time",
        "At 12 months, A-PRF showed somewhat improved results in every measure, especially in root thickness (13.5% vs. 11.2%) and length (15.2% vs. 12.8%). A-PRF’s enhanced performance may be explained by its prolonged release of growth factors that promote angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).[12] Comparing A-PRF to other platelet concentrates, Fujioka-Kobayashi et al.[3] obtained similar results, emphasizing the benefits of A-PRF in promoting cellular proliferation and differentiation.",
        "However, since it offers a naturally occurring matrix for stem cell migration and differentiation, the traditional blood clot continues to be a dependable scaffold for REPs.[4] Its reliance on adequate bleeding into the canal, however, may provide difficulties, especially when the apices are thin or destroyed.[5] This restriction encourages the use of A-PRF as a substitute scaffold when it is not possible to achieve sufficient bleeding.",
        "Both groups’ clinical results are consistent with regenerative endodontics’ tenets, which stress the use of biocompatible scaffolds to promote ongoing root growth.[67]",
        "Both A-PRF and conventional blood clot scaffolds are effective in promoting root development in immature necrotic teeth. While A-PRF showed slightly better outcomes, the differences were not statistically significant, suggesting that either scaffold can be used depending on clinical circumstances.",
        "There are no conflicts of interest."

        "In recent years, nanotechnology has gone through remarkable developments, emerging as significant in several applications, including the food industry, agriculture, and cosmeceuticals [1,2,3]. Moreover, it offers new solutions to overcome the limitations of conventional medicine, with exceptional progress in cancer and diabetes treatment [4,5,6,7,8], regenerative medicine, ocular therapy [9], tissue imaging [10,11], vaccines [12,13], and infections [14]. In particular, nanoparticles (NPs) have been intensively studied for both diagnosis and therapy. As diagnostic tools, NPs equipped with signal molecules are considered an emerging class of contrast imaging agents, showing multimodal signal and multiplexing capabilities, which allow them to be detected by several imaging methods and to detect different molecular targets, respectively [15,16]. For therapeutic applications, NPs represent ideal drug delivery systems, ensuring targeted delivery and controlled release of drugs at specific sites and within defined time windows, providing an alternative to common therapies. With traditional administration methods, drugs are extensively distributed at the systemic level, and high and repeated doses are often required to achieve therapeutically effective concentrations [17,18]. However, loading a drug into an NP increases its stability, prolongs its circulation lifetime, and minimizes therapy-related toxicity [19]. Among the several strategies that have been developed to promote NPs accumulation in a site of interest, active targeting approaches are based on the conjugation of ligands to the NPs surface and depend on the molecular recognition between the ligand-functionalized NP and its specific target expressed at the site of interest [20,21]. Different moieties have been evaluated as ligands for the fabrication of targeted NPs: small molecules like folic acid [22], carbohydrates [23,24,25], aptamers [26], peptides [27], and especially antibodies [28]. Thanks to their high affinity and specificity to a target antigen, antibodies are among the most successfully employed ligands. However, they are large Y-shaped proteins, constituted of two identical light and heavy chains held together by disulphide bonds, and it could be difficult to produce them as recombinant molecules. Thus, smaller antibody fragments (Fabs) are often preferred for antibody-based NPs, since they maintain the specificity of the whole protein without triggering the complement activation [29,30,31]. Furthermore, NPs are intensively studied for their potential to combine diagnostic and therapeutic functions within a single entity, thus enabling simultaneous disease diagnosis and treatment, the selection of optimal treatment, and the monitoring of therapeutic efficacy over time [19,32,33]. The novelty and significance of this study lie in the development of a new biotechnological device, called Nano-Immuno-Probe (NIP). This device consists of PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone polymeric nanoparticles conjugated with recombinant Fab antibody fragments that specifically target the glycoprotein G2 (gG2) of Human Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2). PLGA (Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) and PEG (Polyethylene glycol) are widely used polymers in nanotechnology due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to evade the immune system [34]. The incorporation of bis-sulfone, a benzoic acid derivative, enables the functionalization of these nanoparticles with His-tagged or thiolated compounds, such as peptides, protein domains, or antibodies [35]. This results in nanoparticles that are highly stable, exhibit reduced immunogenicity, and provide efficient drug delivery and precise targeting capabilities [36]. HSV-2 was chosen as the model because a human monoclonal anti-HSV-2 antibody had previously been obtained from a phage display combinatorial library constructed from the iliac crest bone marrow of an infected immunocompromised patient; furthermore, the Fab had already been characterized for diagnostic purposes and targets the glycoprotein G2 [37].",
        "In this work, NIPs were fabricated by a multi-step process that involved synthesizing PLGA-PEG-NH2, conjugating Bis-Sulfone to it, and then eliminating Toluene-sulphonic acid to obtain PLGA-PEG-Mono-Sulfone NPs. The final polymer of the reaction, PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone, was used to synthesize nanoparticles via the nanoprecipitation technique. The resulting colloids were then functionalized with the antibody, creating the NIPs. These devices can deliver both contrast agents and therapeutic compounds, a relatively novel approach in personalized medicine. This dual capability enables a combined diagnostic and therapeutic strategy, potentially enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of treatments while minimizing adverse effects.",
        "To determine the correct synthesis and formation of NIPs, they were characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, an anti-Fab antibody labelled with gold particles was used to confirm the expression of the targeting ligand on the surface of the NIPs; SPR enabled the assessment of the interaction between the NIPs and glycoprotein G2. Finally, the cytotoxicity profile of the NIPs was evaluated on VERO cells.",
        "The Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue (RBC Bioscience, New Taipei City, Taiwan) was used as a host cell in the subcloning and expression experiments. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli cells using standard methods. Following transformation, cells were grown on Luria Bertani LB agar plates (Condalab, Madrid, Spain) and inoculated in Super Broth SB (3.5% tryptone, 2% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 1N NaOH), both containing the antibiotics ampicillin (Amp, 100 µg/mL) and tetracycline (Tet, 20 µg/mL). Single antibiotic-resistant recombinant colonies were selected for protein expression.",
        "The human monoclonal anti-HSV-2 antibody was previously obtained from a phage display combinatorial library constructed from iliac crest bone marrow of infected immunocompromised patients and characterized for diagnostic purposes by Bugli et al. [37]. Multiple subcloning procedures were performed to add a Histidine tag to the C-terminal end of the anti-HSV-2 Fab Heavy Chain (HC), necessary for the chemical conjugation to NPs.",
        "The light and heavy chains were subcloned into pComb3/TIG to obtain the pComb3/TIG-LC-HCHIS, which encodes the Histidine tagged anti-HSV-2 Fab. For the details of the cloning procedure, see Supplementary Materials.",
        "The anti-HSV-2 Fab heavy and light chains were sequenced using the pComb3/TIG-LC-HCHIS without CP3 plasmid as a template. In every Sanger fluorescence-based sequencing reaction, the BigDye terminator v3.1 and its 5× Buffer (Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used. The nucleotide sequence of primers is shown in Table S2 of Supplementary Materials. The sequencing reactions were purified with the DyeEx 2.0 Spin Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to avoid the interference of salts, unincorporated dye terminators, and dNTPs; each reaction was suspended in formamide and the automatic sequencer 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. The data were analyzed with the Chromas Pro 6.0 software.",
        "E. coli XL-1 Blue transformants harboring pComb3/TIG-LC-HCHIS without CP3 were inoculated in 10 mL of sterilized SB medium with 100 µg/mL Amp and 20 µg/mL Tet, and cultivated overnight at 37 °C. This starter culture was used to sub-inoculate (1:50) 1 L of SB medium and cultivated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking (220 rpm), until reaching the OD600 of 0.8. IPTG (isopropyl β-D1-thiogalactopyranoside) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM, 50 µg/mL Amp was added again to reconstitute, and the culture continued at 30 °C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, the culture medium was discarded, and cells washed in PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min and resuspended in 100 mL of PBS. Chicken Egg White Lysozyme Solution (Merck Millipore Ltd., Burlington, MA, USA) was added to a final concentration of 100 µg/mL, and cells were incubated on ice for 30 min. The samples were sonicated eight times for 60 s, and Pierce Protease Inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were added after the first sonication; the bacterial lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 rpm at 4 °C for 45 min, and the supernatant recovered and filtered at 0.22 µm. The Fab was purified on a chromatographic column using a homemade Protein G-Human Fab resin and later analyzed as described in Supplementary Materials (S1.2 and S1.3).",
        "The interactions between the commercial recombinant gG2 glycoprotein (ligand) and the His-tagged anti-HSV-2 Fab or the functionalized NIPs (analytes), were measured using the Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique using a Biacore X100 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). The gG2 ligand was immobilized on a Sensor Chip CM7 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at 50 µg/mL. The immobilization was obtained via amine coupling (with EDC/NHS solutions) in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer. In this process, the carboxyl groups on the CM7 chip are first activated with EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide) and NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide). The protein is then introduced to the activated chip, allowing the amine groups to form a covalent bond with the chip. After immobilization, any remaining reactive NHS esters on the chip surface are deactivated using a solution of ethanolamine. This prevents nonspecific binding during the SPR analysis. Following the immobilization process, affinity analysis is performed. PBS 1X (containing 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 0.137 M NaCl and 2.5 mM KCl) was filtrated and used as a running buffer and the binding experiments were performed with a flow rate of 30 µL/min at 25 °C; the association phase was monitored for 180 s, while dissociation was monitored for 300 s. The concentrations analyzed in the SPR assay for both the analytes refer to the concentration of the Fab species and were obtained by successive dilutions, halving the concentration in each step starting from 4 µM (i.e., 200 µg/mL) for the Fab alone and 1 µM of Fab equivalent for the NIPs. Each experiment was carried out using a minimum of five different analyte concentrations, and to verify the reproducibility of data, at least one concentration was repeated in duplicate. The regeneration of the chip surface was achieved by the addition of 2 M NaCl for 30 s before the start of each new cycle. Subsequently, regeneration was performed using a Glycine-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 2.5) at the end of the analysis. When the experimental data met the quality criteria, data were analyzed using the Biacore X100 Evaluation Software 2.0.1 plus package. An affinity steady state model was applied to fit the data, as kinetic parameters were out of the range measured by the instrument, but an equilibrium signal of interaction was clearly detected. Therefore, a specific KD was determined with a confidence interval associated with a standard error value to avoid any bias.",
        "Nanoparticles were synthesized according to the method described in the following article [35]. A summary diagram of the various steps required to synthesize NIPs is shown in Figure 1a. Briefly, 0.97 g of commercial PLGA-COOH (MW 10 kDa, 0.1 mmol) (Nanosoft polymers, Winston-Salem, NC, USA) was activated and converted to PLGA-NHS with an excess of N,N′-Dicyclo-hexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (both from Fluorochem Ltd., Glossop, UK). Quickly, PLGA-COOH was dissolved in 10 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) followed by the addition of 2.5 equivalents of DCC and NHS. The reaction was left under magnetic stirring for 20 h at room temperature. Once activated, insoluble dicyclohexyl urea was filtered and the final product was dried under vacuum to be conjugated to PEG. PLGA-NHS (900 g) were dissolved in 10 mL of DCM before the addiction of 540 mg of NH2-PEG-NH2 (MW 3 kDa, 0.18 mmol) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). The reaction was left under magnetic stirring overnight at room temperature and the resultant polymer was triturated with methanol (Fluka Chemicals, Buchs, Switzerland), to be later dried under vacuum. Bis-Sulfone activation was achieved by dissolving 100 mg of Bis-Sulfone (0.16 mmol) (Fluorochem Ltd., Glossop, UK) in 10 mL of DCM. Both DCC and NHS were added in a stoichiometric excess of two times compared to Bis-Sulfone. The reaction was left under gentle stirring for 3 h at room temperature and the resulting product was filtered, triturated with diethyl ether (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and lastly dried under vacuum. After the Bis-Sulfone activation, 500 mg of PLGA-PEG-NH2 (0.038 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of DCM. Once solubilized, 1.1 equivalents of activated Bis-Sulfone were added to the solution. The reaction was allowed to proceed under magnetic stirring overnight. The resulting PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone polymer was dried under vacuum and used to prepare the nanoparticles. To obtain PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone NPs, the nanoprecipitation method (see Figure 1b) was performed: 100 mg of PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone were dissolved in 1 mL di tetrahydrofuran (Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA); then, 200 µL of the resultant product were added dropwise to 5 mL of stirring water. The reaction was left to proceed overnight, and the next day PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone NPs were analyzed through DLS.",
        "The conversion of PEG-Bis-Sulfone to PEG-Mono-Sulfone was induced through the addition of an appropriate buffer to the NPs solution. Briefly, 150 µL of a solution constituted of 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), and 500 mM phosphate buffer pH 8 (Carlo Erba, Val de Reuil, France) was added to 1.35 mL of PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone NPs. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for ~6 h. 500 µL of the His tagged anti-HSV-2 dialyzed Fab (4 µM, in PBS 1×) was added to 1.5 mL of PLGA-PEG-Mono-Sulfone NPs for the NPs functionalization reaction and incubated with gentle agitation at room temperature overnight. To avoid unspecific signals, the unbound Fab that did not react with the NPs Mono-Sulfone was removed from the solution using the VivaSpin 6 mL Concentrator, 100,000 MWCO (VivaScience by Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). The sample was loaded into the VivaSpin Concentrator, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 2.5 min, and 1 mL of the flow through (referred to as unbound Fab) was collected for further analysis. After five washes in PBS, the NIPs without the unbound Fab were recovered in 1 mL of PBS.",
        "DLS experiments were performed using the Zetasizer Nano S (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) equipped with a 4 mW He-Ne laser (633 nm). Measurements were carried out at 25 °C at an angle of 173° from the incident beam. The Z-Average diameters of the scattering particles were calculated by peak-intensity and number analysis. The Zeta-Potential values were collected using DTS1070 (Disposable Folded Capillary cell). Samples were diluted 1:100 with distilled water before the analysis.",
        "Droplets of NPs and NIPs suspensions (10 μL) were placed on formvar-carbon coated grids and allowed to adsorb for few min. The adsorbed samples were processed for negative staining by washing the specimen grid on a drop of negative stain solution (2% uranyl acetate dissolved in distilled water) and then repeating this step once more leaving the specimen grid on a new drop of negative stain solution for 120 s. Contrast agents were used only for low-contrast materials (e.g., PLGA). Samples were observed with a JEOL 1200 EX II electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Micrographs were acquired with an Olympus SIS VELETA CCD camera (Shinjuku City, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with the iTEM software 2009.",
        "For immunogold staining (IGS), NPs and NIPs suspensions were adsorbed on formvar-carbon coated grids, as described in the previous paragraph. Non-specific antigens were blocked with 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min. Subsequently, samples were incubated for 60 min in a moist chamber with a polyclonal antibody anti-human Fab conjugated to 25 nm gold particles (St John’s Laboratory Ltd., London, UK), and diluted 1:500 in 0.1% Tween20 and 1% BSA in PBS (pH 8.2). After rinsing in 0.5% BSA in PBS and then in PBS (5 min each), the grids were washed three times with distilled water (5 min each). PBS was substituted with the anti-human Fab antibody in the negative controls. Samples were subsequently stained with uranyl acetate and observed with a JEOL JEM EX II transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 100 kV. Micrographs were acquired with an Olympus SIS VELETA CCD camera equipped with the iTEM software 2009.",
        "VERO eukaryotic cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified environment (CO2 5%) in MEM containing L-glutamine, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin Antibiotic (all Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). A total of 50,000 cells/well in basal medium were seeded into a 96-well plate (Corning Incorporated, Kennebunk, MA, USA) until a sub-confluent monolayer was achieved. Cells were treated with different concentrations of NIPs to achieve the following NIPs final percentages: 50%, 25%, 12.5%, and 6.25% v/v. Untreated cells were used as the control. After 24 and 48 h of incubation, cellular viability was evaluated by the MTS assay, using the MTS Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Abcam Plc, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer instructions. The optical density (OD) of the solution in each well was determined with a plate reader at a wavelength of 490 nm. Cell vitality was calculated according to the following equation: Viability (%): (OD sample/OD control) × 100.",
        "Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.1.2 for Windows, GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA, USA).",
        "From the anti-HSV-2 original plasmid, in which the genes encoding the monoclonal antibody light and heavy chains had been previously cloned, the LC gene was subcloned into the pComb3/TIG vector. Subsequently, the PCR amplifications of the HC gene with the addition of a four Histidine tag at the C-terminal end was accomplished. The amplifications performed with the specific primer for the His tag addition showed no difference compared to those with the unmodified primer (Figure 2). The HC was cloned into the LC containing vector, resulting in the anti-HSV-2 pComb3/TIG-LC-HCHIS vector verified by restriction analysis; positive clones were identified.",
        "The amino acid sequence of the HCHIS and LC variable regions of the anti-HSV-2 Fab was inferred from their DNA sequence. Seven domains were sequenced for both the HCHIS and LC of 122 and 105 amino acids (Table S3), respectively. The sequencing of the CH1 constant region of the heavy chain showed four Histidines at the C-terminal end.",
        "Small-scale optimization experiments were conducted to characterize the best expression conditions. The Fab fragment was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography on a human anti-Fab sepharose column starting from 1 L of induced cell culture. The eluted fractions were analyzed on polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions; a band of about 25 kDa was detected as expected. Elution fractions 2 and 3 with the highest Fab concentration were pooled and dialyzed against PBS. The pooled elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE before and after the dialysis. As can be seen in Figure 3, dialysis did not alter the Fab concentration. The final yield obtained was measured at 200 µg/mL (4 µM).",
        "NIPs were fabricated according to the procedures described in Methods (paragraph 2.7). Briefly, the PLGA-PEG-NH2 co-polymer was synthesized from PLGA-NHS and NH2-PEG-NH2, the Bis-Sulfone was conjugated to it, and the PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone NPs were achieved by nanoprecipitation. Through the elimination of the Toluene-sulphonic acid at basic pH, the PLGA-PEG-Mono-Sulfone NPs were obtained, and the reaction with the C-terminus His tagged anti-HSV-2 Fab resulted in the NIPs. To verify the synthesis process, several analyses were performed on the intermediate and final products. Table 1 shows the z-average diameters and polydispersity indexes of PLGA-PEG-NH2 NPs and PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone NPs and NIPs, measured by DLS. Nanoparticle tracking analysis on PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone NPs provided a high-resolution particle size distribution profile from 90 to 200 nm and a concentration measurement of 1010 particles/mL (see Figure S1 in the Supplementary Materials).",
        "Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) was employed to characterize the Zeta Potential (Z-potential) of nanoparticles both before and after functionalization. The final results are presented in Table 2. To ensure significance, three independent measurements were conducted for each sample. The Zeta Potential value of nanoparticles alone was determined to be −0.7 ± 0.3 mV, whereas the Zeta Potential of NIPs was found to be −5.1 ± 1.9 mV. The lower Z-potential of NIPs can be attributed to the introduction of negatively charged groups from the Fab fragment causing an alteration in surface charge distribution and accessibility.",
        "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to obtain a direct visualization of the nanoparticles with high resolution. When TEM is applied to visualize nanoparticles, a treatment of negative staining is necessary to describe the ultrastructure and potential alterations. As shown in Figure 4a,b, NPs and NIPs had a spherical shape and size heterogeneity. No changes in nanoparticle conformation, alteration of membrane curvature, or formation of roughening or surface ruptures were observed in NIPs compared to NPs. Moreover, an anti-Fab antibody labelled with gold particles was used in order to recognize the available epitopes of the anti-HSV-2 Fab, and used as a specific ligand to functionalize the PLGA-PEG-Mono-Sulfone NPs. Figure 4c shows a magnification depicting this interaction. Gold particles were found on the surface of NIPs, revealing the expression of the targeting ligand. As expected, the staining was not observed on the surface of NPs or in negative controls (Figure 4d).",
        "To avoid an unspecific signal, at the end of the NIPs synthesis process, the Fab not conjugated to the NPs surface was removed from the solution using twin vertical PES membranes with a molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of 100 kDa. The removal of the unbound Fab was verified through a Western blot performed on the solution that flowed through the PES membranes (FT), and on the free anti-HSV-2 Fab. The free Fab was analyzed at the same concentration used in the binding reaction with the NPs. As shown in Figure 5, a slight band corresponding to the Fab fragment size (~25 kDa) was visible in the FT, much less intense than the band corresponding to the free Fab. The unbound Fab signal was so imperceptible that it was assumed that all of the anti-HSV-2 Fab fragment used in the reaction was bound to the NPs. For this reason, the concentration of the Fab bound to the NPs surface of NIPs was estimated at 50 µg/mL (1 µM). The anti-HSV-2 Fab fragment had already been characterized and it targeted the HSV-2 glycoprotein G2; once the unbound Fab had been removed, the NIPs ability to specifically recognize and bind to the gG2 was investigated through SPR, following the procedures described in materials and methods. In particular, a commercial recombinant gG2 was immobilized on a CM7 sensor chip and used as a ligand in the assay, whereas the NIPs were used as an analyte. The optimal experimental setup was settled, and the analyte was injected at five different concentrations using a multi-kinetic mode. As shown by the scatchard plot in Figure 6a, a major concentration of NIPs was related to an increase of the Response Unit (RU); an apparent KD of 1.03 ± 0.61 µM was estimated (Table 3). SPR was performed to assess the interaction between the free anti-HSV-2 Fab and the gG2 (Figure 6b) as well. Table 3 shows the estimated KD value obtained through a kinetic analysis. No interaction was measured between the NPs and the gG2.",
        "The NIPs cytotoxicity profile was assessed on VERO cells through the MTS assay. As shown in Figure 7, after 24 and 48 h, no cytotoxic effect was observed in the presence of NIPs at all of the four tested concentrations (50%, 25%, 12.5%, and 6.25% v/v). According to ISO 10993-5, a reduction of cell viability by >30% should be considered a cytotoxic effect [38]: as can be seen in Figure 7, all the median viabilities were indeed above 70%. No cytotoxic effect was observed on cells in the presence of PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone NPs at a concentration equal to 50% v/v, at 24 and 48 h.",
        "Nanotechnology has become pivotal in various fields, particularly in overcoming medical challenges [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,39]. This study addresses the urgent need for highly sensitive diagnostic and therapeutic solutions, focusing on developing a biotechnological device intended for early detection of specific pathogens with a great clinical impact and, eventually, for the direct in situ treatment of the infection. HSV-2, chosen as the model for this project, is a common virus of the Herpesviridae family. Primarily known for causing genital herpes, HSV-2 is a neurotropic virus with significant clinical impact that poses challenges due to its ability to establish latent infections and reactivate periodically. Despite its global prevalence and impact on quality of life, antivirals are the current standard medication to prevent viral reactivation [40,41,42,43]. The human monoclonal anti-HSV-2 Fab, obtained from an immunocompromised patient’s bone marrow, targets glycoprotein G2 [37]. To develop NIPs, PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone NPs needed Fabs functionalization, involving subcloning procedures to add a four Histidine tag to the antibody. The LC gene was cloned into the pComb3/TIG vector, and PCR amplifications added a four Histidine tag to the HC gene using a modified constant region primer (CG1z4HIS). The CG1z4HIS primer showed good quality amplifications and no differences compared to those with the unmodified one (CG1z), and unlike the CG1z6HIS primer, which would have added six Histidines. After subcloning HCHIS into the LC containing vector, the monoclonal anti-HSV-2 Fab was expressed in E. coli XL-1 Blue cells, assembling in the periplasmic space via disulphide bond formation. Fab extraction was achieved through mild ultrasound cell disruption, followed by successful purification using immunoaffinity chromatography. In this study, NIPs were created using a method outlined in Section 2. Various types of NPs with specific features can be designed as needed. Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA) was selected for its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval, tunable mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability [44]. PLGA can be polymerized with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), enhancing nano drug delivery systems and increasing circulation half-life [45]. PLGA-PEG NPs have been employed for various medical applications, including cancer and Alzheimer’s disease treatment, inflammation management, and drug delivery [46,47,48,49,50,51]. To validate NIPs synthesis, several techniques were employed. DLS analysis indicated an expected size increase with good polydispersity index and correlation coefficient values. Z-averages of 86.6 ± 10.9 nm with a Zeta Potential value of –0.7 ± 0.3 mV for PLGA-PEG-Bis-Sulfone NPs and 151 ± 10.4 nm with a Zeta Potential of −5.1 ± 1.9 mV for NIPs were obtained, corroborated by nanoparticle tracking analysis showing a size distribution profile of 90 to 200 nm. Size is crucial for NP function, with smaller systems (<200 nm) facilitating tissue acceptance and micro-capillary crossing [19,52]. In an SPR assay, NIPs’ specificity for glycoprotein G2 was confirmed, showing no alteration in Fab stability or unfolding upon conjugation to NPs. However, the binding affinity of NIPs-gG2 was lower than that of the free anti-HSV-2 Fab. These results may be due to the low number of Fab fragments that functionalized the NIPs. Furthermore, as Fabs on NIPs are chemically bound to the NPs surface and not free in solution, their engagement with gG2 immobilized on the CM7 sensor chip in the SPR assay was limited. In fact, the unbound Fabs on NIPs may not contribute to increasing the binding affinity, even if they are indeed part of those NIPs. These data suggested that the interaction between NIPs and gG2 differs from the one evaluated for the free Fab, providing further evidence of the successful NIPs synthesis reaction. Finally, the data obtained from the toxicity test on VERO cells indicate that NIPs showed no cytotoxic effects at 24 and 48 h.",
        "The in vitro experiments conducted in this study showed that Nano-Immuno-Probes successfully recognized and bound to the specific target of the anti-HSV-2 Fab, which was tethered to NPs surface. This suggests that NIPs could serve as effective tools for detecting specific pathogens and early identification of the infection sites, potentially enabling direct in situ treatment and significantly improving patients’ prognosis. NIPs can be produced through a fast synthesis with high yield and mild reaction conditions, making them a versatile and effective platform. However, scaling up production to industrial levels poses challenges in maintaining consistency and quality, and high costs.",
        "Successful development of these nanodevices could greatly expand the pharmaceutical market for advanced drug delivery systems, with potential applications extending beyond viral infections to various diseases, thus enhancing treatment efficacy and personalized medicine approaches.

        "Liposomes are nanocarriers made of single units that can self-assemble, driven by soft interactions. Like cell membranes, they can be composed mainly of phospholipids and cholesterol (Figure 1). Phospholipids are amphiphilic macromolecules that exhibit both hydrophobic and hydrophilic behavior; thus, once in contact with water, they tend to aggregate, forming lipid bilayer nanocarriers [1]. Liposomes have some interesting advantages: they are easy to prepare, versatile, highly biocompatible, and biodegradable [2,3]. Moreover, they can be loaded with biologically active compounds that can be conveyed to a desired target. The cell–liposome interaction depends on liposomes’ physiochemical features such as size, shape, hydrophobicity, and surface charge. Specifically, neutral and negatively charged particles display poor cell interaction, whereas positively charged liposomes usually show enhanced cell interaction [3,4].",
        "Due to liposomes’ structure, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules can be loaded, entailing their use in a wide range of applications (Figure 1). First of all, they are employed as bioactive agent delivery systems [5]—for example, drugs such as doxorubicin for anticancer therapy [6] and levodopa for Parkinson’s disease treatment [7]. Moreover, the nutraceutical is an emerging field, and liposomes loaded with compounds such as ascorbic acid [8], curcumin [9], and β-carotene [10] are being widely studied [11]. Nucleic acids can also be entrapped within liposomes for gene therapy and vaccine delivery [12].",
        "Liposomes resemble extracellular vesicles (EVs), the lipid bilayer-delimited particles naturally produced and secreted by cells. Hence, liposomes can be used as a simplified EV study model. EVs influence almost every process in cell physiology, playing a key role in intercellular communication and immunomodulation [13]. Recently, EVs emerged as promising pleiotropic tools also in regenerative medicine [14] as they offer significant benefits compared to cell therapy; since they cannot undergo neoplastic transformation, they are stable under freezing/thawing cycles, and they can be loaded with drugs and/or biomolecules [13]. EVs have recently been demonstrated in preclinical neurotrauma models, including spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury, showing their role in functional recovery and neurovascular plasticity [15]. Additionally, EVs demonstrated an immunomodulatory function and a drug delivery function [13,16]. Unfortunately, several in vivo studies indicate that the therapeutic efficacy of both injected liposomes and EVs is largely reduced by their rapid clearance and short half-life that limit their use as an effective therapy [14,17,18]. To overcome these drawbacks, biomaterial-based strategies represent promising approaches to enhance their therapeutic potency in tissue regeneration. Indeed, biomaterials are able to control the spatial and temporal delivery of active agents with a controlled release profile, thus reducing adverse effects, improving potency, and decreasing the number and amount of doses required [19].",
        "Recently, great efforts have been devoted to developing suitable hydrogels as controlled release systems [20,21]. Hydrogels are networks able to mimic natural the extracellular matrix (ECM), support cell adhesion, and allow the diffusion of nutrients, gases, and waste products [19]. Naturally occurring biopolymers are widely exploited to fabricate ECM-mimicking materials since they display most of the abovementioned properties. In this scenario, chitosan represents a very attractive biopolymer for drug delivery and regenerative medicine applications [20,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. Indeed, chitosan is a low-toxicity, non-immunogenic, and biodegradable polymer deriving from the partial deacetylation of chitin, the second most abundant polysaccharide on Earth [29,30].",
        "Herein we report an original method to form an injectable thermosensitive nanocomposite hydrogel based on chitosan for the controlled delivery of liposomes. The biocompatibility towards cell models and the performance of this set of hybrid materials are additionally disclosed, confirming the interesting role that these hydrogels could play in regenerative medicine.",
        "In order to promote chitosan gelation at physiological temperature, β-glycerophosphate was exploited as a crosslinking agent. β-glycerophosphate was mixed with a chitosan solution, forming a colorless liquid mixture. Upon increasing the temperature, β-glycerophosphate promoted the formation of a turbid hydrogel.",
        "The gelation process was investigated by rheological tests. In detail, the loss tangent was recorded as a function of temperature (Figure 2A). The progressive increase in elastic modulus (G’) and decay of viscous modulus (G’’) suggested the transition from a viscous solution towards a hydrogel with time. Indeed, heat promotes the transfer of protons from positively charged chitosan chains (due to the positively charged amine groups) to β-glycerophosphate, progressively enhancing chitosan chain interaction and hydrogel formation [31]. The gelation time was calculated as the intersection of the two moduli [32] and was equal to 32.6 °C. This gelation temperature is optimal to devise injectable hydrogels to be used in regenerative medicine approaches. Indeed, this system can be easily mixed at a low temperature and injected in the recipient site to form a hydrogel in physiological conditions, at a temperature close to 37 °C. Similar gelation temperatures were previously reported for other systems based on chitosan and β-glycerophosphate [33,34,35]. On the other hand, other authors reported a different gelation temperature (from 21 to 79 °C) for systems based on chitosan and polyol phosphates (e.g., glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate) [32,36,37,38]. These differences can be attributed to the different concentrations of chitosan and polyol phosphates and also to the different behavior of the polyol phosphates [37].",
        "The ability of the hydrogels to uptake solvent was investigated by swelling tests. The hydrogels showed a marked ability to uptake a large amount of solvent (Figure 2B). Specifically, after one hour, the hydrogels were able to increase their mass by 68.0 ± 8.3%, and after 5 h, their mass was doubled (+100.5 ± 13.4%).",
        "Liposomes (0.96 mg/mL) containing cholesterol and α-phosphatidylcholine were prepared and characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses. The liposomes had a medium hydrodynamic diameter close to 130 nm, associated with low dimensional dispersion (PDI lower than 0.2) (Table 1). Additionally, the liposomes displayed a negative surface charge. Similar dimensions and dimensional dispersions were reported by other authors for natural EVs [39,40,41]. This suggests that liposomes can be considered a simplified and synthetic model of native EVs.",
        "In order to study the liposomes’ interactions with cells, fluorophore-labeled liposomes were also prepared. In this case, a green fluorescent derivative of lyso phosphatidylcholine—i.e., TopFluor® Lyso PC, an analogue to α-phosphatidylcholine—was introduced during liposome synthesis to promote its integration within liposomes’ membrane [42]. By using this approach, the fluorescent derivative of the phospholipid was able to integrate within the liposome membrane, favored by both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. The resulting liposomes showed a slight increase in size compared to non-labeled vesicles (Table 1). Specifically, fluorophore-labeled liposomes displayed dimensions of 179 ± 1 nm. The slight increase in dimensions indicates that the presence of the fluorescent lipid promoted limited aggregation and an increase in dimensional dispersion (PDI of 0.35 ± 0.02) of liposomes.",
        "The hybrid system was prepared by mixing liposomes and chitosan solution and subsequently promoting chitosan gelation by adding β-glycerophosphate. In order to investigate the interaction between liposomes and chitosan, a simplified model of the hybrid system was investigated. Highly concentrated—and viscous—chitosan solutions are not suitable for DLS analyses. In this case, a low chitosan concentration was exploited, and the resulting system—mentioned as chitosan-coated liposomes (0.98 mg/mL)—was analyzed by DLS. In the presence of chitosan, an increase in size was detected. Specifically, in the presence of chitosan, the medium hydrodynamic diameter was close to 240 nm (Table 1). This size increase was also associated with an opposite surface charge as this formulation displayed a positive surface charge. These phenomena suggest that the positively charged chitosan is able to associate to negatively charged liposomes, promoting new system formation with an increased size and a positive charge.",
        "In vitro tests with cells were then performed to assess the interaction between the biomaterial and cells and to verify that the chitosan coating is able to enhance cell interaction. Free fluorophore-labeled liposomes and the hybrid system resulting from the combination of aforementioned liposomes and the chitosan-based thermosensitive hydrogel were used to this end. After cell culturing for 24 h, the resulting samples were embedded in OCT, a high-viscosity medium to quickly embed fresh samples; frozen; and cut into 6 µm width slices using a cryostat. Samples were then analyzed with an inverted fluorescent microscope. The same procedure was performed on the hybrid thermosensitive hydrogel embedded with fluorophore-labeled liposomes and incubated with cell culture media—and without cells—for 24 h prior to the processing. By using the hybrid system even after the incubation in the media for 24 h, it was possible to detect the presence of liposomes within the hydrogel network mesh (Figure 3A). This result suggests that by exploiting this hybrid system, it is possible to provide a controlled release of liposomes. The controlled release was mainly promoted by the hydrogels swelling. Indeed, the thermosensitive hydrogels showed a marked ability to uptake a large amount of solvent (Figure 2B). This indicates that the polymer mesh of the hydrogel progressively tends to become loose and to promote a controlled release of liposomes. Figure 3B,C show how liposomes were efficiently internalized by cells within 24 h and how cells internalized a higher number of liposomes by using the hybrid system (Figure 3C).",
        "The liposomes’ interaction with cells was then quantitatively investigated by spectrofluorimetric analyses: cells were incubated with fluorophore-labeled (TopFluor® PC) liposomes; then, at different time points—from 3 h to 7 days—the uptake was determined (Figure 3D). Both free liposomes and the hybrid system were used. At all the time points investigated—3, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days—the percentage of liposomes internalized by cells was higher in the presence of the hybrid system compared to the use of free liposomes. In detail, in the hybrid system, a progressive increase in liposome uptake by cells was detected over time. More than 60% of liposomes (66.3 ± 15.0%) were internalized by cells after 7 days. On the other hand, when using free liposomes, the number of internalized liposomes was lower and constant up to 3 days (<10%) and then slightly increased at day 7 of incubation, with only around 30% of the liposomes internalized (26.5 ± 12.7%).",
        "In vitro biocompatibility tests were then performed on free liposomes and the hybrid system (i.e., combination of liposomes and thermosensitive hydrogel). To this end, cell viability was verified by MTT assay after 24 h of incubation. While there was a slight reduction in cell viability in the presence of free liposomes, the hybrid system did not show any cytotoxicity; no statistical differences between the controls (cells only) and the cells treated with the hybrid system were detected (Figure 4A), suggesting the absence of toxicity in the formulation. This indicates that the hybrid system based on liposomes within a thermosensitive hydrogel can be considered suitable for cell culture.",
        "A qualitative cell morphology analysis was then considered to verify the cell health and the absence of apoptotic cells. The cell nuclei morphology was analyzed by DAPI as fluorescent staining on an inverted fluorescent microscope. All nuclei display a defined round shape, without any debris and any apoptotic morphology, in either control cells (Figure 4B), in cells incubated with liposomes (Figure 4D), or with the hybrid system (Figure 4F). In all cases, no condensed chromatin aggregates were detected, confirming that no apoptotic cells were present [43].",
        "Additionally, bright field images were simultaneously acquired (and superimposed to fluorescent images) in order to investigate the cell morphology. Control cells (Figure 4C) and cells incubated with liposomes (Figure 4E) or with the hybrid system (Figure 4G) displayed an elongated and healthy morphology, without any cellular debris. These results confirm the absence of toxicity of the present formulation.",
        "In the present study, we have proposed a method to fabricate a hybrid system based on liposomes and a thermosensitive hydrogel for regenerative medicine applications. A hybrid system is able to overcome some drawbacks commonly shown with the use of free liposomes (e.g., rapid clearance and limited therapeutic potential) [5,6,7]. Among all the injectable and biocompatible systems suitable for regenerative medicine applications, chitosan and β-glycerophosphate were selected for their peculiar properties. Chitosan is a biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-immunogenic polymer derived from the seafood waste industry [23,29]. This polymer is very versatile and can be used to fabricate different structures, including fibers, hydrogels, scaffolds, and micro- and nanoparticles [44,45,46,47]. These systems based on chitosan are widely used for biomedical applications, especially for the delivery of therapeutic agents and for regenerative applications [45,48,49,50,51]. On the other hand, β-glycerophosphate is a biocompatible and naturally occurring molecule that is commonly present in our body. More specifically, β-glycerophosphate serves as a source for the phosphate in hydroxyapatite synthesis and is able to tune the differentiation of target cells, including the differentiation of stem cells toward an osteogenic phenotype [31,52].",
        "The hydrogel investigated in this study showed a gelation temperature equal to 32.6 °C, indicating the possibility to be used as an injectable delivery system. By combining the thermosensitive hydrogel with liposomes, we obtained a hybrid controlled-release system. This system can be applied to achieve sustained release of liposomes or EVs, which normally show a poor half-life when administrated alone [14,17,18]. Although liposomes have a synthetic origin and EVs are naturally produced by cells, both are lipid bilayer nanocarriers able to deliver bioactive molecules, so liposomes may be considered a simplified EV model [3,13].",
        "Despite a slight reduction in cell viability in the presence of free liposomes, the hybrid system did not show any cytotoxicity. A similar reduction in the cell viability of a human carcinoma cell line (A549 cells) in the presence of free liposomes was previously reported by other authors for cationic liposomes and was attributed to their peculiar surface charge [53]. A comparable reduction in cell viability was also reported by Soe and colleagues for the same cell line incubated with free liposomes [54]. On the other hand, the present hybrid system based on liposomes and the thermosensitive hydrogel did not show any cytotoxicity towards a cell model. In this case, liposomes’ cell internalization resulted to be strictly affected by their features: chitosan was able to efficiently interact with liposomes, promoting a change—from negative to positive—in the surface charge. This change in physicochemical properties was attributed to the efficient ability of positively charged chitosan to interact with negatively charged phospholipids of liposomes, concealing their native surface charge and bestowing a positive surface charge to chitosan-coated liposomes. In vitro tests suggested that the presence of chitosan is able to enhance the interaction with cells and to promote a higher cellular uptake. In fact, the liposomes were progressively internalized by the cells in a controlled manner at higher concentrations compared to free liposomes. This ability can be attributed to electrostatic interactions between the positively charged chitosan and the negatively charged liposomes’ membrane [55,56]. Thus, liposomes coated with chitosan were able to efficiently interact with cells. Furthermore, chitosan is able to efficiently interact with the membrane receptor CD44, which is overexpressed in many cell types [57,58]. Consequently, liposomes in the presence of chitosan were efficiently internalized by cells.",
        "Overall, this study demonstrated the possibility of combining a thermosensitive hydrogel and liposomes. Considering all the benefits offered by the resulting system, we propose the use of these hydrogels as a versatile platform that can be translated into the controlled release of EVs, and they can be used as innovative translational biomaterials in the field of regenerative medicine.",
        "Low-molecular-weight chitosan (CH, 50,000–190,000 Da), β-glycerophosphate disodium salt hydrate (β-GP), cholesterol, acetic acid, α-phosphatidylcholine (α-PC), TopFluor® lysophosphatidylcholine, thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT), paraformaldehyde (PFA), phosphate-buffered saline (1X) w/o Ca and Mg (PBS) (pH = 7.4), sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and absolute ethanol were purchased from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) reagent, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin mixture (pen/strep), and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM/F12) were from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound was from Histo-Line Laboratories (Pantigliate, Italy).",
        "Chitosan and β-glycerophosphate solutions were separately prepared. The concentration of chitosan was equal to 25 mg/mL, whereas the concentration of β-glycerophosphate was equal to 645 mg/mL. Chitosan was solubilized in deionized water containing 1% v/v acetic acid, whereas β-glycerophosphate was solubilized in deionized water. Both solutions were stored overnight at 4 °C before mixing. Then, β-glycerophosphate solution was added dropwise to the chitosan solution in an ice bath (to maintain a stable temperature) under magnetic stirring. The resulting mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C to promote the hydrogel formation.",
        "Rheological measurements were performed using a Bohlin C-VOR 120 rotational rheometer equipped with a thermostatic unit (KTB 30). After samples’ preparation (according to Section 4.2), the resulting mixture at 4 °C was transferred onto the rheometer plate. The experimental settings used to evaluate gelation kinetics are the following: stainless steel plates with 4° cone/plate geometry, diameter = 40 mm, and gap = 0.150 mm. Temperature sweep experiments were performed in strain-controlled conditions, with deformation (γ) of 0.01 and frequency (ν) of 1 Hz kept constant throughout the experiment. Upon addition of β-glycerophosphate, samples were mixed under stirring for about 10 s to make them uniform and then poured on the plate. The values of storage G’ (elastic response) and loss G’’ (viscous response) moduli were recorded as a function of time. Temperature sweep experiments were performed in the range of 5–37 °C.",

Data are reported as % of mass gained with respect to the initial weight of three samples (± standard deviation, SD).",
        "Cholesterol and α-PC were solubilized by using ethanol as a solvent. The concentration of cholesterol was equal to 20 mg/mL, whereas that of α-PC was equal to 40 mg/mL. The organic phase consisted of 25 µL of cholesterol solution, 12.5 µL of α-PC solution, and 62.5 µL of ethanol (total volume 0.1 mL), while the aqueous phase consisted of 1 mL of deionized water. For liposomes’ preparation, the organic phase was injected (1-milliliter syringe, 25 G) in the aqueous phase at room temperature under magnetic stirring (700 rpm). The resulting mixture was maintained under stirring (250 rpm) for 5 min. After 30 min, liposomes were collected.",

The same abovementioned final concentrations of chitosan and of β-glycerophosphate were used.",
        "Chitosan-coated liposomes were prepared in order to investigate the interaction between liposomes and chitosan. Indeed, highly viscous solutions and macroscopic hydrogels are not suitable for DLS analyses. To this end, the aqueous phase of liposomes was substituted by TPP solution (1.5 mg/mL). The resulting liposomes (1.1 mL) were then added dropwise to a chitosan solution (1 mg/mL in 0.1% v/v acetic acid solution, 1 mL) under magnetic stirring (250 rpm) at room temperature for 30 min.",
        "Liposomes and chitosan-coated liposomes were characterized by means of dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a Zetasizer Nano ZS with 173° detection optics (Malvern Instruments, USA).

        "BALB/3T3 cells (ATCC CCL-163) were used for cytotoxicity tests. BALB/3T3 cells were grown using DMEM with 10% v/v FBS and 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin. MG63 cells (human osteosarcoma cells, CRL-1427, ATCC®, Washington, DC, USA) were used to evaluate the cell interaction. MG63 cells were grown using DMEM/F12 medium with 10% v/v FBS and 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin.",
        "BALB/3T3 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate with 2500 cells/cm2 density. After 24 h, the hybrid formulation was diluted in cell culture medium (dilution factor equal to 20) and added to the wells. Cells without any additional treatment were used as a control. After 24 h, the MTT test was used for the evaluation of cells’ biocompatibility. Briefly, a small volume of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) in PBS 1X was added in 1/10 ratio to the wells. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and then the cell culture medium was removed. Finally, DMSO was added to each well (0.2 mL). After 15 min, supernatants were analyzed using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Multiskan FC, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 570 nm absorbance. Additionally, cell nuclear morphology was analyzed by DAPI staining after cell fixation in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde (PFA) and microscope visualization with an inverted fluorescent microscope (Eclipse TS 100, Nikon, Japan).",
        "For indirect release study in vitro, MG63 cells (human osteosarcoma cells, ATCC® CRL-1427) were seeded at 2500 cell/cm2 density. After 24 h, hybrids were added to cells after dilution in cell medium (dilution factor equal to 10). After 1 day, cell media were collected and centrifuged (13,800× g, 5 min).

        "Statistical analysis and graph elaboration were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Two-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) was performed followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test to evaluate differences among different groups and the control. An unpaired Student’s t-test was performed to evaluate differences between two groups.

        "In the present work, two different systems were combined in order to devise an injectable nanocomposite system for the controlled release of liposomes for regenerative medicine applications. The resulting system was able to provide controlled release of liposomes, preventing the disadvantages related to the use of free liposomes. The controlled release was promoted by the hydrogel swelling. Indeed, the thermosensitive hydrogels showed a marked ability to uptake a large amount of solvent. This indicates that the polymer mesh of the hydrogel progressively tends to become loose and promote controlled release of liposomes.",
        "Additionally, by using fluorescent labeling of liposomes, it was possible to investigate the interaction of free liposomes and chitosan-coated liposomes with cells. The presence of a chitosan coating was able to change the physicochemical properties of liposomes—promoting the change of surface charge from negative to positive—and to enhance their interaction with cells. This latter aspect is of pivotal importance and highlights that chitosan can be used to improve the interaction with cells for a large number of possible applications—not only limited to regenerative medicine. We propose the use of these hydrogels as a versatile platform that can be translated into the controlled release of EVs, and they can be used for novel and advanced applications in regenerative medicine. This system can also be easily adapted for the controlled release of different nucleic acids, bioactive molecules (e.g., natural compounds for nutraceutical applications), and drugs.",
