Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the different PD models and their utility for different research purposes.",
        "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease named after James Parkinson who reported the clinical syndrome more than two centuries ago. Pathologically, PD is the result of selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra, which causes decreased level of dopamine in the striatum and lead to abnormal motor control [1]. The motor symptoms include bradykinesia, muscle tone rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. In addition, PD patients also display several non-motor symptoms, such as sleep disorders, dementia, sensory abnormalities, and autonomic dysfunctions [2]. The etiology of PD is still largely unknown, although research suggests that the cause involves multifactorial factors such as genetics, environmental agents, and aging [3].",
        "The current treatment regime uses levodopa or dopaminergic agonists to target the primary pathophysiology of PD, which only alleviates the motor symptoms by restoring neurotransmission [4]. However, long term use of these drugs can lead to severe side effects such as wearing-off symptoms and other motor complications [5,6]. When the fluctuation begins, other dopaminergic medications such as monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors, dopamine receptor agonists and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist amantadine are used in conjunction to manage the levodopa induced complications [7]. Post-mortem neuropathological confirmation is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis. The lack of access to human brains have led scientists to develop diverse range of experimental models using animals and in vitro cultured cells that could mimic different aspects of PD.",
        "Three major animal groups have been extensively used for modeling PD: rodents, non-human primates (NHP), and non-mammalian species. Moreover, cell-based model has also emerged as a feasible disease model for PD. There are distinct advantages and limitations of each group which determine the suitability of the model for a specific experiment.",
        "Rodents are commonly used as the animal model because of the ease of care in laboratory environment and availability of transgenic mouse strain as well as established protocols. Specifically, rodents are used to model PD because the nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration directly correlates with motor deficits observed in these animals. The behavioral phenotype of rodent unilateral lesions can be examined through a series of tests including measuring movement, grip, or strength of the front paws. The most common behavioral test for PD includes the open field test for locomotor activity, pole test to measure bradykinesia, and stepping test to measure akinesia. Other motor tests including grip strength test, grip coordination test, and rotarod test measure the strength, coordination, and balance. For dyskinesia, it can be measured through tremor monitor and posture assessments [8,9].",
        "The non-motor symptoms are often described in rodents with partial nigrostriatal lesions. The non-motor assessments include activity (sleeping, drinking, and eating) monitoring, tail suspension test, and forced swim test to assess weight loss, depression, and behavioral despair, respectively [10,11]. Other aspects of non-motor symptoms can also be examined through monitoring, for instance presence of excessive grooming due to compulsive behavior and reduction in nest building behavior due to lacking motivation in goal oriented task [12].",
        "In medical research, NHP has played a critical role in providing significant insights into the mechanism of disease because NHP is closely related to humans genetically and physiologically [13]. However, studies of NHP require extensive labor and expenses as well as ethical considerations. To date, only an estimated 10% of PD research are carried out in NHP. Due to the high cost and ethical issues, NHP studies are often performed for preclinical evaluation of therapies [14]. The parkinsonian symptoms in NHP are generated through administration of neurotoxin or viral vector carrying abnormal genes. The severity of the phenotype can be measured through a Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-like measure, however this assessment on NHP has not been standardized [15].",
        "NHP models exhibit symptoms like humans, for instance macaques show Levodopa-induced dyskinesia that resemble human chorea and dystonia. Akinesia and axial rigidity could be assessed in NHP through jumping in the tower test and hourglass test, respectively [16]. In addition, it has been suggested that macaques better replicate human sleeping pattern as compared to rodents, which makes it a superior model to study sleep or social behavior related symptoms [17]. Moreover, neuroimaging studies have been done in NHP and that has provided valuable information when compared to patients in clinical studies [18]. Hence, NHP is a valuable animal model for PD but the study requires high resource support, expertise, and is time consuming.",
        "Small organisms such as Caenorhabditis (C.) elegans, drosophila, and zebrafish have been used because of the ease of genetic manipulations, short life cycle, low costs of maintenance, and most importantly well-defined neuropathology and behavior [19]. Hence, it is particularly useful for large scale drug screening. C. elegans is a 959-cell nematomorph that has a simple nervous network comprising 302 neurons and a dopaminergic network with exactly 8 neurons [20]. C. elegans expresses various human gene homologues of LRRK2 (lrk-1), PINK1 (pink-1), Parkin (pdr-1), and DJ-1 (dnaj-1.1 and dnaj-1.2) that are directly implicated in familial forms of human PD but do not express α-Synuclein [21].",
        "In Drosophila, the pathway of dopamine synthesis is similar to humans. Thus, Drosophila has emerged as a feasible model for studying neurodegeneration in PD. Neurotoxin-treated drosophila exhibits PD-like symptoms including degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, locomotor defects and oxidative stress [22]. Zebrafish has been widely used in the study of PD pathogenesis because of rapid life cycles and close genetic similarity to human. Additionally, the dopaminergic neurons in zebrafish’s posterior tuberculum (homologous to SN in human) are well characterized. When exposed to neurotoxin, zebrafish displayed alteration in locomotor activity [23]. These findings suggest that the non-mammalian species are feasible model systems to study the molecular mechanism of the disease.",
        "Recently, Yamanaka et al. made a significant breakthrough by inducing pluripotent stem cells. They generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) by overexpressing four major transcription factors, Oct3/4, c-Myc, Sox2, and Klf4 [24]. iPSC-derived PD models offer a unique advantage as experiments could be performed directly on the cells isolated from patients. Studies using patient derived iPSCs with certain mutations have certainly provided significant insights on the molecular pathology of PD [25,26]. However, current neuronal cultures lack the complete physiological network of connections that mimic the brain physiology. PD cellular models are useful for researchers to focus on one aspect of the disease and it has been known that the manipulation of cellular models is relatively quick, and more cost effective compared to animal models. Cellular models are ideal for large scale drug screening that could help narrow down potential drug targets for further validation in animal models [27].",
        "In general, current PD experimental models are categorized into two main groups: neurotoxins and genetics. Neurotoxin-based models induce the rapid degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons which mimic the sporadic PD. The neurotoxin-based models could be developed by introducing neurotoxins such as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), paraquat, and rotenone. With the addition of neurotoxins, oxidative stress is generated and this can lead to cell death in dopaminergic (DA) neuronal population. However, the disadvantage is lack the formation of Lewy bodies the main pathology hallmark of PD. Despite the limitations, these animal models have contributed significantly to discovering the disease processes and potential therapeutic targets in PD [28].",
        "In recent studies, rare forms of PD have been found to be associated with genetic mutations in α-Synuclein, parkin, LRRK2, PINK1, or DJ-1, which could potentially be the therapeutic targets. Genetic models of PD are created through transgenic overexpression of α-Synuclein and LRKK2 or knockout/knockdown for genes such as Parkin, DJ-1, and PINK1, to study the molecular mechanism of these genes in PD pathology [29]. Genetic model is a compelling approach to examine the association of specific mutations in the familial forms of PD. However, few of these models reproduce the complete features of the disease and often quite different from the human conditions. For instance, most of the genetic models failed to induce significant loss of dopaminergic neuron, the main pathological hallmark of PD [30].",
        "It has been known that dopaminergic neurons lesion could be induced through administration of the structural analogs of dopamine, such as 6-OHDA and MPTP. In addition, chronic exposure to agricultural chemicals has been reported to have harmful effect to the neurons and increase the risk of PD. These findings allow research groups to generate different PD models using neurotoxins.",
        "The first animal model of PD was generated based on the administration of 6-OHDA. It has been widely used in PD research because of its consistent behavioral phenotype in these models and predictable degeneration in dopaminergic neurons. Intracerebral injection of 6-OHDA is required because it does not penetrate the blood brain barrier [31,32]. Once inside the cell, 6-OHDA rapidly oxidizes and produces reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide radicals, and hydroxyl radicals that lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Administration of 6-OHDA in different brain regions will cause distinctive pattern of neurons degeneration. For instance, 6-OHDA injection directed to striatum will damage the axon terminals first in striatum followed by dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra (SN) [33]. In contrast, injection of 6-OHDA into SN leads to massive destruction of dopaminergic neuron. Hence, the latter approach shows relatively severe symptoms.",
        "Numerous studies have been conducted on 6-OHDA models to examine the neuroprotective function of some compounds. For instance, combined treatment of antioxidants and iron chelators have shown positive effects in neutralizing 6-OHDA neurotoxicity [34]. In addition, therapeutic effect of Tanshinone I have also been examined using the 6-OHDA model [35]. It is known that 6-OHDA model does not mimic the pathology of PD perfectly which lacks the Lewy Bodies (LB) formation [36].",
        "MPTP is one of the most used neurotoxins in PD animal models. MPTP is a lipophilic molecule which makes it able to cross the blood brain barrier easily. After systemic administration, MPTP can be oxidized into potent dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) by the monoamine oxidase B in astrocytes. MPP+ is a toxic metabolite that is readily absorbable by dopaminergic neuron through dopamine transporter (DAT) because of its structural similarity to dopamine [37]. Subsequently, MPP+ induces progressive loss of DA neurons in the SN together with decrease striatal dopamine levels [38]. The mechanism of cell death is induced by MPP+ inhibition of complex I in mitochondrial respiration. This results in rapid decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration in striatum and SN followed by apoptosis and necrosis of DA neurons [39].",
        "MPTP animal model is recommended for studying mitochondrial dysfunction in PD because of its unique antagonist activity in mitochondria. To closely reproduce PD in animal models, chronic administration of the toxin needs to be carried out over weeks which will result in continuous cell death after completion of toxin administration. The topographic pattern of dopaminergic cell loss in the striatum does replicate that of PD [40]. However, MPTP model lacks the most important neuropathological feature of PD which is the formation of Lewy Bodies (LB) [36].",
        "Paraquat is a widely used herbicide that was identified as a neurotoxicant based on its structural similarity to MPP+. The use of paraquat as common pesticide has raised public concern because it could be an environmental contributor to the etiology of PD [41]. The toxicity of paraquat to neural system was tested in frog few decades ago. The result showed that cumulative paraquat dosing has induced several behavioral features as observed in PD [42]. Additionally, systemic injection of paraquat in mice has produced loss of dopaminergic neurons. Paraquat reportedly cross the blood brain barrier through a neutral amino acid carrier. Though Paraquat has structural similarity to MPP+, it does not inhibit mitochondrial complex I like MPP+. Instead, Paraquat impairs the redox cycling of glutathione and thioredoxin. This will affect the function to protect against oxidative stress in cells [43].",
        "In the characterization of the paraquat model of PD, nigral dopaminergic neuron loss was observed without striatal dopamine depletion. This indicates that the model represents certain pathological features of clinical PD but may have different neurochemical effects. However, a study has shown that chronic administration of paraquat resulted in chronic neurodegeneration and dopamine depletion that could be used to study preclinical stage of PD [44]. Additionally, synergistic combinations of paraquat with other compounds have been adopted to produce PD phenotype in animal. For instance, experiments combining neonatal iron exposure with adult paraquat exposure have been conducted and demonstrated age-dependent nigral dopamine cell loss [45]. Based on the data, paraquat PD model could be useful to study the earlier stages of the disease compared to other models because the PD phenotype develops chronically.",
        "Rotenone is a natural compound found in plants that have been used as insecticides. It is lipophilic and can penetrate the blood brain barrier to inhibit mitochondrial complex I like MPTP. However, Rotenone produces systemic inhibition that is different from MPTP which targets on the catecholaminergic neurons [46]. The first Rotenone model was created through stereotaxic injection into the parenchyma at extremely high concentration, which resulted in significant decreases in striatal dopamine and serotonin [47]. However, it is believed that the results produced by such high doses are not specific for dopaminergic neurons. Indeed, high concentration of rotenone has induced liquefactive necrosis in striatal region. In contrast, when Rotenone is administrated chronically at a lower dose, it has induced selective cell degeneration at nigrostriatal region [48].",
        "In rotenone animal model, α-Synuclein inclusions like Lewy body were observed in the surviving dopaminergic neuron [48]. Additionally, other PD related features were observed in rotenone animal model such as motor deficits, catecholamine depletion, and nigral dopamine cell loss. With its ability to reproduce key pathological features of human PD, it can be a valuable tool to conduct studies on neuroprotection. This model has been used in a research studies that examined the efficacy of melatonin in neuroprotection [49].",
        "Genetics plays a significant role in PD pathogenesis. Research studies have identified the disease-causing gene using linkage analyses and association analyses for familial PD and idiopathic PD, respectively [50]. SNCA (α-Synuclein) is the first gene identified in familial PD [51]. Following the breakthrough, several other familial PD-linked genes were discovered such as parkin, DJ-1, PINK1, and LRRK2 [52,53,54,55].",
        "α-Synuclein is a small protein (at size of 14 kDa) that is present abundantly in the pre-synaptic terminals. The specific physiological function of α-Synuclein remains uncharacterized. However, it has been known to be associated with the regulatory activity in membrane and vesicular dynamics [56,57]. Mutations of α-Synuclein have been characterized in the inherited form of PD, for instance substitutions (A53T, A30P, and E46K), duplication, or triplication [58]. Importantly, α-Synuclein is identified as the major building block of Lewy Bodies (LBs). Based on the significant findings, scientists have started to model PD via the over expression of wild type or mutant forms of α-Synuclein in animals. The first ever transgenic mouse model was created by Masliah et al. [59]. They have observed progressive formation of neuronal inclusions in the hippocampus, SN, and neocortex that antibodies stained positively to α-Synuclein. However, the inclusions are not of fibrillar structure that resembles LBs. In addition, there was no significant dopaminergic neuron degeneration observed in the mice [59]. The first transgenic mouse model generated by the group did not fully replicate human pathology.",
        "Following that, more α-Synuclein models were generated through expression via the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter. This is to achieve localized effect of α-Synuclein which expresses specifically in catecholaminergic neurons [60]. Similarly, this approach has failed to induce α-Synuclein inclusions and dopamine cell loss. However, in a model with double mutant (A30P/A53T), apparent neurites dystrophy was reported. This phenotype was accompanied by deterioration in motor activity and neuronal aggregates [61]. These models are useful to elucidate the function of α-Synuclein related neurodegeneration, though the clinical relevance of this model for PD is questionable.",
        "LRRK2 mutations are associated with autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance in familial PD, with varying penetrance in different population. G2019S and R1441C/G are the two most common LRRK2 mutations [62]. Similarly, most LRRK2 transgenic animal models failed to recapitulate the important PD hallmarks. Interestingly, BAC-LRRK2-R1441G transgenic mice show motor deficits and axonal pathology in the striatum, however in the absence of clear dopamine cell loss and α-Synuclein aggregations [63].",
        "Other LRRK2 models have been created using viral vectors such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and adenoviral vectors. Transfection of LRRK2-G2019S is known to be more effective than WT LRRK2 in stimulating neurodegeneration and formation of inclusions. Infection of HSV-LRRK2-G2019s in mouse striatum has achieved approximately 50% degeneration of the dopaminergic neuron in the SN [64]. LRRK2 models could provide valuable information on the association of genetic mutations and environmental factors as well as to unravel the complicated mechanisms behind their functions in PD. The effect of LRRK2 kinase inhibition has been tested and recommended as the potential therapeutic option in PD [65].",
        "Parkin is the most common autosomal recessive mutations found in the early onset of PD, which is linked to approximately 50% and 20% of familial and idiopathic cases respectively. Parkin is a ubiquitin ligase that plays an important role in proteasomal degradation and the disease-causing mutations of parkin has resulted in loss of function [66]. The Parkin-linked parkinsonism could lead to the accumulation of neurotoxic substrate. Numerous knockout Parkin models have been generated but with no success. None of the knockout models recapitulate typical phenotype of PD [67].",
        "Nonetheless, pathophysiologic studies of Parkin and its role in neuroprotection have been widely reported. Primary midbrain culture prepared from the Parkin knockout lines exhibit increased susceptibility to the insult by rotenone. Further supporting this, overexpression of parkin has prevented dopaminergic neurodegeneration in rats treated with 6-OHDA as well as mice treated with MPTP [68]. In summary, Parkin model is still far from being ideal animal model for PD, however Parkin itsef could be a potential therapeutic target.",
        "DJ-1 mutations have been known to be associated with recessive forms of familial parkinsonism. Several studies suggest that DJ-1 is an antioxidant protein, which is useful in counteracting the oxidative environment of DA neurons [69]. Unfortunately, elimination of DJ-1 in mice did not induce dopamine cell loss in the SN even at the old age. Moreover, no accumulation of inclusion bodies detected in these mice. DJ-1 knockout lines were tested with reduced DA release in the striatum as a result of DA reuptake by the DA transporter (DAT), however it is not observed in all knockout line. DJ-1 null mice display hypokinesia in the open field tests [70]. The observations suggest that DJ-1 deficiency could trigger motor dysfunction even in the absence of nigral neurodegeneration [71,72]. However, due to limited pathology data from DJ-1 data, it is difficult to conclude whether DJ-1 null model mirrors the human condition.",
        "It is important to note that DJ-1 knockout mice model is hypersensitive towards the insults of MPTP and rotenone. Locomotor of mouse model remains unaffected in the absence of DJ-1. However, apparent locomotor deficit was observed in DJ-1 knockout mice upon neurotoxin treatments as compared to WT mouse model. This indicates that DJ-1 plays a neuroprotective role in our neural system [73]. DJ-1 knockout mice could be a valuable tool to study the molecular mechanism of PD.",
        "Mutations in Pten-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are associated with recessive parkinsonism. PINK1 is a neuroprotective kinase found primarily in the mitochondria and cytosolic compartments and plays a role in neuronal differentiation [74]. Increased expression of PINK1 induced neurite outgrowth in SH-Sy5y cells and the length of dendrites in dopaminergic neurons [75]. In addition, studies have shown that PINK1 mutants display dopaminergic neuronal degeneration together with locomotive defects. Phenotype of PINK1 mutants has been characterized using transmission electron microscopy analysis and a rescue experiment which showed that mitochondrial dysfunction was responsible for all phenotypes observed in PINK1 null drosophila [76].",
        "Both PINK1 and parkin mutants have been found to have similar phenotypes including abnormally positioned wings, disorganized muscle fiber with enlarged mitochondria, impaired flight ability, and reduced climbing rate [77]. Thus, PINK1 and parkin possibly play important roles in the same pathway. Rescue experiments were conducted in PINK1 null flies and showed that Parkin work downstream of PINK1 in the same pathway [76].",
        "PINK1 knockout mouse models have also been generated, however there is no obvious PD pathology observed in the brain [72,78]. Studies have shown that PINK1 knockout mice were susceptible to oxidative stress and ROS production though without dopaminergic neuronal degeneration or reduced striatal dopamine levels. Complete suppression of PINK1 function in G309D-PINK1 transgenic mice can induce an age-dependent dopamine reduction with decreased locomotor activity [78].",
        "In vitro midbrain organoids have been generated from iPSC with different protocols [79,80,81]. The midbrain organoids generated from the PD patients iPSCs or genetically modified healthy controls iPSC may reflect the disease progress in human patients [82]. Mechanisms underlying dopaminergic neuron demise and potential drug treatments can be tested in these models.",
        "Recent findings of clinical association of HLA with PD and potential involvement of immune system in the pathogenesis have shed light on a new avenue of the disease [83,84]. Protocols inducing midbrain inflammation or autoimmunity which may lead to dopaminergic neuron degeneration will provide novel animal models to understand the role of immune system in PD pathogenesis and treatment [85].",
        "Various neurotoxic and genetic animal models have been generated for PD studies. In the neurotoxic model, chemicals such as 6-OHDA, MPTP, rotenone, paraquat, etc. are commonly used to induce PD-like symptoms in animals [9,32,42,47]. However, each of the chemical inductions has its own advantages and disadvantages, as shown in Table 1. For instance, MPTP induce PD-like pathology by targeting the cell mitochondria and thus it is a useful model to study mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinsonism [39]. However, the MPTP method does not fully recapitulate human PD pathology in animals [86]. In the rotenone model, key features of Parkinsonism have been induced including motor deficits, catecholamine depletion, Nigral dopamine cell loss, and most importantly Lewy body formation [48,49]. As such, rotenone model is an ideal model for the study of Lewy body formation in PD pathology as compared to MPTP model.",
        "Likewise, only certain transgenic models displayed typical PD phenotypes, for example LRRK2 and G309D-PINK1 knockout mouse model [64,78]. However, Parkin, DJ-1, and α-Synuclein knockout failed to generate the PD pathology in mouse models. Cellular-based and non-mammalian species models have been used to study the association linking genetic mutation to PD and have provided valuable insights on the molecular mechanism [59,67,70]. New animal models have also been generated to study the role of immunity in PD [85]. Unfortunately, to date, there is no perfect animal model for PD research. It is challenging to develop a model that can fully recapitulate the features of human PD, which usually take years to manifest. Despite the limitations, current animal models do provide a useful platform to selectively study the pathophysiology and the interactions of the multiple etiologic factors involved in PD.",

        "Neurocognitive diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by cognitive or behavioral dysfunction, and impairments in thinking, remembering, and reasoning, which develop as a consequence of the progressive neural loss and degeneration [1]. These diseases are age-dependent and their incident has been continuously increasing, in part because the elderly population has increased in last decades [2]. Neuroinflammation has been implicated as both an initiating and a causative factor of neurocognitive diseases [3]. As a response to microbial pathogens, innate immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells), produce various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that increase permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), enabling recruitment of circulating leucocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) [3]. Additionally, through the secretion of neurotrophins and immunoregulatory factors, innate immune cells provide neuroprotection, promote axonal regeneration, and maintain homeostasis in the CNS [3]. Weak immune response is incapable of eliminating infectious pathogens, while excessive immune response aggravates ongoing inflammation, resulting in the development of severe inflammation and neurodegeneration [3]. Accordingly, use of therapeutic agents, which may suppress detrimental immune response and may provide trophic support to injured neurons, is required for efficient treatment of neurocognitive diseases [3].",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells that reside in almost all post-natal tissues and organs, including the brain [4,5]. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that MSCs isolated from amniotic fluid (AF-MSC), dental pulp (DP-MSCs), and brain (B-MSCs) may differentiate into functional neuronal cells [4,5,6]. Additionally, MSCs, in paracrine manner, through the production of immunomodulatory factors (transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), hepatic growth factor (HGF), nitric oxide (NO), indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6)) and pro-angiogenic factors (basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)), TGF-β, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), angiopoietin-1, placental growth factor (PGF), IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), HGF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) regulate immune response, induce generation of new blood vessels, and provide trophic support to injured neurons, enabling enhanced repair and regeneration of neural tissue [7]. Accordingly, due to their capacity for differentiation in neural cells and due to potent immunosuppressive and angiomodulatory properties, MSCs have been explored as new therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurocognitive diseases [8].",
        "However, several safety issues raised serious concerns about the use of MSCs in clinical settings [9]. Encapsulated structures, which contained calcifications and ossifications, were observed in the MSC-treated tissues, suggesting unwanted osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of transplanted MSCs under the influence of local microenvironment [9]. Additionally, combined therapy of immunosuppressive drugs and MSCs resulted in the development of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in some patients, indicating that MSCs should not be administered together with other immunosuppressive agents [9,10]. Furthermore, several chromosomal aberrations were notice in long-term cultures of human MSC, indicating that rigorous genetic analyses of MSCs should be performed before their transplantation in patients [9,10].",
        "Age, genetic traits, and medical history of the donor significantly affect therapeutic potential of MSCs [10]. Age-related changes, including loss of proliferation and differentiation potential and reduced therapeutic effectiveness, should be taken into account whenever MSCs are considered for autologous clinical applications in the elderly patients [10]. Similarly, in comparison with the MSCs of healthy donors, MSCs derived from patients with inflammatory or metabolic diseases showed significantly impaired proliferation and differentiation potential [10]. Although transplantation of allogeneic MSCs may circumvent age and disease-related problems, the risk of possible immunological response against allogeneic MSCs exists [11]. MSCs lack expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and co-stimulatory molecules, but express MHC class I molecules and, therefore, may elicit strong allogeneic immune responses in MHC-class I-mismatched recipients, resulting in tissue injury and inflammation [11].",
        "Additionally, results obtained in several clinical trials demonstrated that MSC-based immunosuppressive effects were observed in only a proportion of patients and that some MSC-treated patients, although affected by the same disease, did not respond to MSCs, while ongoing inflammation was aggravated upon injection of MSCs in some patients [9,10]. Immunophenotyping of engrafted MSCs revealed that their immunomodulatory properties depended on the cytokine milieu of the microenvironment in which MSCs were transplanted [9,11]. When MSCs are engrafted in the tissue with high levels of inflammatory cytokines, particularly interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), MSCs acquire an immuno-suppressive phenotype and produce a large number of immunosuppressive factors, resulting in the inhibition of inflammatory immune cells [11]. On the contrary, when MSCs are transplanted in the microenvironment with low levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α, MSCs enhance production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which induce generation of inflammatory phenotype in tissue resident immune cells and attract circulating leucocytes in the tissue, contributing to the development and progression of inflammation [11].",
        "A large number of experimental and clinical studies demonstrated that the majority of MSC-based immunoregulatory and angiomodulatory effects in the therapy of neurocognitive disorders relied on the activity of MSC-sourced bioactive factors (lipids, proteins (enzymes, cytokines, chemokines, immunoregulatory proteins, trophic, and growth factors), microRNAs (miRNAs)), which efficiently modulated immune response, induced neo-angiogenesis, and promoted repair and regeneration of injured neurons [8]. These MSC-sourced immunosuppressive and neuroprotective factors are contained within MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos), which, due to their nano-sized dimension and lipid envelope, easily penetrate through the neural tissue and reach the target cells [12]. Membrane enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, ceramide, and lipid raft proteins surrounds MSC-Exos’ content, protecting it from degradation. MSC-Exos express several adhesion molecules, including cluster of differentiation (CD)29, CD44, and CD73, which enable their migration to the inflamed and injured tissues. Through the direct fusion with the plasma membrane, MSC-Exos deliver their content to the cytosol of target cells, modulating their phenotype and function [5]. MSC-Exos contain nucleic acids, proteins (cytokines, chemokines), and lipids. Mass spectrometry and microarray analysis identified 4850 gene products and 4150 miRNAs within MSC-Exos. MiRNAs, particularly miR-146 and miR-21, may alter the phenotype, function, and viability of neural and immune cells and, therefore, were considered as crucially important for beneficial effects of MSC-Exos in the therapy of neuro-inflammatory diseases [5]. Since side effects related to the clinical application of MSCs were not observed in animals and patients who were treated with MSC-Exos, MSC-Exos were considered as a potential substitution for MSCs in the therapy of inflammatory and degenerative neural diseases [12].",
        "During the past decade, a large number of experimental studies provided evidence about beneficial effects of MSC-Exos in the treatment of Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, post-traumatic and ischemic brain injury, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Table A1) [12,13,14,15,16,17]. In this review article, we emphasized their findings, indicating MSC-Exos as potentially new therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurocognitive diseases. The primary objective of this review article was to summarize current knowledge about the therapeutic potential of MSC-Exos in the treatment of neurocognitive diseases. The secondary objectives were to delineate molecular mechanisms responsible for the MSC-Exo-based alleviation of neuro-inflammation and neuro-degeneration and to identify all obstacles that limit clinical use of MSC-Exos in the treatment of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction.",
        "An extensive literature review was carried out in December 2020 across several databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, The Cochrane Library), from 1990 to present. The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines [18]. Keywords used in the selection were: “mesenchymal stem cells”, “exosomes”, “neurocognitive dysfunction”, “degenerative diseases”, “inflammatory diseases”, “regeneration”, “immunosuppression”, “Alzheimer’s disease”, “Parkinson’s disease”, “brain injury”, “schizophrenia”, “autism spectrum disorders”. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied for identification of eligible studies. Articles that were not translated into the English language and did not have full text available, articles that conducted only in vitro experiments, and articles that evaluated only effects of MSC-based therapy and did not analyze the effects of MSC-sourced secretome in the treatment of neurocognitive disorders were excluded from this review article. Articles written in the English language with full text available and articles that examined MSC-Exo-dependent effects in vivo, in animals, or in patients with neurocognitive disorders were included in this review article.",
        "C.R.H., A.V., V.D., and V.V. applied the search with the above criteria independently. A risk of bias analysis, performed by A.V. and V.V. independently, was carried out using Cochrane’s tool, Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 2) [19]. Each study was allocated a low, intermediate, or high risk of bias in accordance with the RoB 2.0 guidance in the five categories (selection of the reported results, measurement of the outcome, missing outcome data, deviations from intended interventions, randomization process). Various signaling questions were answered in each category and the outcomes of the signaling questions were averaged to produce an overall risk in each of the five categories [20]. An overall risk of bias was then determined for each study by the cumulative result of these five categories. A study was judged to be at high risk of bias if it was at high risk for at least one category or had some concerns for multiple categories. A study was judged to be of some concern if there were some concerns in at least one category, but not to be at high risk in any category. A study was judged to be at low risk of bias if at low risk of bias for all five categories [19,20].",
        "Three hundred two articles were found from Medline. An additional five articles were retrieved from three other sources. No duplicates were identified. A total of 307 articles were retrieved, and the title and abstract of each article was screened for appropriateness. Two hundred fifty-nine articles were removed by application of the exclusion criteria. Forty-eight full-text articles were included in qualitative synthesis (Figure 1). All selected studies were assigned low risk for the domain of baseline characteristics and also had a low risk of selective outcome reporting, as well as a low risk of other sources of bias.",
        "Study design and outcomes of each selected study were retrieved and analyzed. Details regarding the study design included the sample size, the gender and species of the animals, the animal model used, and the details of the treatment for experimental and control groups. The details of the treatment also included the tissue source of MSCs and the concentration, volume, frequency, and route of injected MSC-Exos.",
        "All eligible studies had to delineate molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the MSC-Exos-based therapy of neurocognitive diseases and their findings were emphasized in this review article.",
        "Alzheimer disease (AD) is an incurable and progressive neurodegenerative disease manifested by memory loss, cognitive dysfunction, abnormal behavior, and impaired functions of daily living [21]. Patients with exacerbated AD usually fall into stupor state and die due to exhaustion and incapacitation [21]. The main neuropathological hallmarks of AD include accumulation of amyloidal plaques (insoluble deposits of amyloid β peptide (Aβ)) and formation of neurofibrillary tangles (intraneuronal aggregates of the hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau), which are most usually localized in the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus of the brain [21]. Accumulated Aβ peptides inhibit transmission of the synaptic signal while intraneuronal aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins results in a disassembling of microtubules, leading to the cell death of affected neurons [21].",
        "Although the origin of AD remains unknown, several experimental studies indicate that exosomes distribute neurotoxic molecules between neuronal cells, playing a crucially important role in AD progression [22]. MSC-Exos may use the same pathways (gap junctions, synaptic transmission, endosomal/lysosomal secretion system) to deliver MSC-sourced neuroprotective and trophic factors in injured neurons, preventing AD progression [5,12]. Accordingly, a large number of studies demonstrated beneficial effects of MSC-Exos in the treatment of AD [23,24,25,26,27,28].",
        "Most recently, by using amyloid precursor protein/presenilin1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice, a well-established animal model of AD, Wang and Yang demonstrated that intravenously injected bone marrow (BM)-derived MSC-Exos (BM-MSC-Exos) significantly reduced Aβ deposition and improved cognitive function recovery in APP/PS1 mice by activating sphingosine kinase (S1K)/sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling pathway in the CNS [23]. S1K and S1P regulate metabolism of sphyngomyelin, maintain vascular integrity, and promote the development of blood vessels within the CNS, playing an important role in the delivery of neurotrophins to injured neurons [24]. Down-regulated expression of S1K and/or S1P was observed in the brain tissue samples of AD patients [25]. BM-MSC-Exos are enriched with S1P [23]. Accordingly, administration of BM-MSC-Exos reduced deposition of Aβ proteins and enhanced the expression of Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN; biomarker of neuronal cells) in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice [23]. Additionally, BM-MSC-Exos reduced activity of the β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and down-regulated expression of presenilin-1 (PS1), which are required for the generation and subsequent accumulation of Aβ. Moreover, BM-MSC-Exos increased activity of neprilysin, Aβ-degrading enzyme that inhibits progression of AD [23]. BM-MSC-Exo-based reduction of intraneural Aβ deposition significantly improved spatial learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice [23]. An improvement of cognitive function was followed by increased expression of S1K and S1P and was completely diminished by intraperitoneal injection of S1K or S1P inhibitors, indicating that BM-MSC-Exo-based beneficial effects in AD relied on the activation of S1/S1P signaling pathways in neural cells [23].",
        "Elia and colleagues also demonstrated that BM-MSC-Exo-based neuroprotection in APP/PS1 mice was based on BM-MSC-Exo-dependent activation of Aβ-degrading enzyme, neprilysin [26]. Intracerebral injection of BM-MSC-Exos significantly enhanced expression and activity of neprilysin, which reduced deposition of Aβ proteins in APP/PS1 mice. Accordingly, the total amount of dystrophic neurites was significantly lower in the cortex and hippocampus of BM-MSC-Exo-treated APP/PS1 mice compared to untreated animals [26].",
        "Reza-Zaldivar and colleagues demonstrated that MSC-Exos restored cognitive function of AD mice in a similar manner as their parental MSCs [27]. Results obtained by Morris water maze (MWM) and Novel object recognition (NOR) test showed that injection of either MSC-Exos or MSCs efficiently alleviated cognitive impairment in AD mice [27]. Parameters that determined learning ability and memory loss showed that there was no difference in beneficial effects achieved by MSCs and MSC-Exos. MWM test showed that both MSC-Exos and MSCs significantly increased learning abilities of AD animals, while NOR test demonstrated that MSC-Exos- and MSC-treated mice exhibited similarly increased percentage of interaction time compared to the untreated AD mice, indicating that MSC-Exos were mainly responsible for MSC-based improvement of cognitive function [27].",
        "Ma and coworkers showed that adipose tissue (AT)-derived MSC-Exos (AT-MSC-Exos) provide neuroprotection, induce neurogenesis, and ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice [28]. After their intranasal administration, AT-MSC-Exos rapidly entered the brain and accumulated within neurons and glial cells [28]. Significantly reduced deposition of Aβ proteins and decreased activation of microglia were observed in AT-MSC-Exo-treated APP/PS1 mice [28]. Proteomics analysis showed that AT-MSC-Exos contained multiple proteins, including filamin-A, vinculin, neuropilin-1, neuroplastin, glia-derived nexin, flotillin-1, drebrin, teneurin-4, and stathmin, which induce neurogenesis and myelin formation, promote neurite outgrowth and branching, stimulate axonal growth and regeneration, and provide neuroprotection to injured neurons. RNA sequencing revealed that 1094 genes were up-regulated, while 267 genes were down-regulated in AT-MSC-Exo-treated neurons [28]. AT-MSC-Exos increased expression of PCLO, TENM1, NEXMIF genes that regulate synaptic function and improve memory function of experimental animals and decreased expression of BAD gene, which induced enhanced death of injured neurons. Accordingly, AT-MSC-Exos significantly ameliorated neurologic damage, increased total number of newly generated neurons, and efficiently rescued memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice [28].",
        "Microglia-driven neuroinflammation aggravates the accumulation of Aβ proteins and importantly contributes to the development and progression of AD [3]. Accordingly, several studies demonstrated that MSC-Exos attenuated cognitive dysfunction of APP/PS1 mice by suppressing pro-inflammatory properties of microglia [29,30,31]. Ding and colleagues showed that umbilical cord (UC)-derived MSC-Exos (UC-MSC-Exos) modulated phenotype and function of microglia, attenuated neuroinflammation, and repaired cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice [29]. Additionally, UC-MSC-Exos significantly increased the levels of Aβ-degrading enzymes (neprylisin and insulin-degrading enzyme), which remarkably reduced Aβ deposition in the brains of experimental animals [29]. Results obtained by MWM test showed that UC-MSC-Exo-treated APP/PS1 mice had a significantly shorter mean escape latency and accomplished a larger number of platform location crossing times and a longer time spent in the target quadrant than MSC-Exo-untreated animals, suggesting that UC-MSC-Exos increased the behavioral performance by improving spatial learning and memory function of APP/PS1 mice [29]. UC-MSC-Exos attenuated the presence of Iba-1-positive microglia cells in the brain and induced polarization of microglia toward immunosuppressive M2 phenotype [29]. Significantly higher numbers of chitinase 3-like 3 (YM-1), arginase-1 (Arg-1), mannose receptors C type 1 (MRC1), and the haptoglobin/hemoglobin scavenger receptor (CD163)-expressing M2 microglia were noticed in the brains of UC-MSC-Exo-treated APP/PS1 mice than in UC-MSC-Exo-non-treated animals [29]. Accordingly, concentration of M2 microglia-derived immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF-β and IL-10) increased, while levels of M1 microglia-sourced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) decreased in the peripheral blood and in the brains of UC-MSC-Exo-treated APP/PS1 mice, confirming that UC-MSC-Exos alleviated neuroinflammation and improved cognitive function of APP/PS1 mice by inducing generation of immunosuppressive phenotype in microglia [29].",
        "In line with these findings are results obtained by Nakano and colleagues, who emphasized the important role of MSC-sourced miRNA-146 for MSC-Exo-dependent suppression of microglia and neuroinflammation in AD mice [30]. MiRNA-146 is a small, noncoding RNA molecule, which regulates inflammatory properties of microglia [30]. MSC-Exos, in miRna-146-dependent manner, inhibited TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) in microglia, resulting in the down-regulated phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) [30]. Suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway alleviated expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 genes and inhibited generation of inflammatory M1 phenotype in MSC-Exo-treated microglia [30]. Nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β), released from M1 microglia, affect synaptogenesis and impair cognitive function, resulting in the progression of AD [31]. Accordingly, by suppressing activation of M1 microglia and by promoting their differentiation in M2 immunosuppressive cells, intracerebroventricularly injected BM-MSC-Exos in miRNA-146-dependent manner alleviated neuroinflammation and improved spatial learning and memory function of APP/PS1 mice [30,31]. In addition to miRNA-146, MSC-sourced miRNA-21 was also responsible for MSC-Exos-based immunomodulation and neuroprotection in APP/PS1 mice [32]. Exosomes obtained from hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs prevented memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice by suppressing microglia activation in miRNA-21-dependent manner [32]. Significantly increased miRNA-21 corresponded to the reduced deposition of Aβ proteins, down-regulated concentration of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β), reduced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and NF-κB, and increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the brains of MSC-Exo-treated APP/PS1 mice, indicating the important role of MSC-Exo-sourced miRNA-21 for beneficial effects of MSC-Exos in the treatment of AD [32].",
        "Although MSC-Exos may cross the BBB, the majority of intravenously injected MSC-Exos accumulated in the spleen and liver [5]. Therefore, Cui and colleagues conjugated MSC-Exos with neurotropic rabies viral glycoprotein (RVG; RVG-tagged MSC-Exos) to target intravenously infused MSC-Exos to the brain of APP/PS1 mice [33]. RVG-tagged MSC-Exo exhibited improved targeting to the cortex and hippocampus of experimental animals, more efficiently prevented accumulation of Aβ proteins, and suppressed activation of microglia than RVG-nontagged MSC-Exos [33]. RVG-tagged MSC-Exo significantly reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-β, and IL-6) and raised the levels of immunosuppressive IL-10 in serum samples of experimental mice. Accordingly, behavioral performance and cognitive functions of APP/PS1 mice that received RVG-tagged MSC-Exos were significantly better than learning and memory capabilities of animals that were treated with RVG-nontagged MSC-Exos [33].",
        "Although results of preclinical studies are promising, the efficacy of MSC-Exos in restoration of cognitive function of AD patients is not demonstrated in clinical settings yet. A phase I/Ⅱ clinical trial, which will evaluate the safety and the efficacy of allogenic AT-MSC-Exos in attenuation of mild to moderate dementia, is currently recruiting AD patients for participation in the study (National Clinical Trial (NCT)04388982). Patients will be assigned to one of three experimental groups to receive 5 µg, 10 µg, or 20 µg of AT-MSC-Exos, twice a week for 12 weeks. Therapeutic effects of AT-MSC-Exos on cognitive function and quality of life of AD patients will be evaluated by Alzheimer disease assessment scale-cognitive section (ADAS-cogs) and Alzheimer disease cooperative study activities of daily living test (ADCS-ADL). This clinical trial will be conducted in China at Ruijin Hospital, affiliated to the Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. According to the estimated study completion date, the first results should be expected in April 2022.",
        "The hippocampus is essential for cognition, spatial learning, and memory [34]. Accordingly, cognitive dysfunction and memory loss develop as a consequence of hippocampal damage [34]. Traumatic injury and ischemia induce transient neurogenesis that represents a compensatory response that should promote functional recovery of the damaged neurons [35]. However, endogenous regenerative capacity of a damaged brain is very limited [35]. By providing trophic, vasoactive, and immunomodulatory factors in injured neurons and microglia, MSC-Exos inhibit detrimental immune response and promote neurogenesis and neuritogenesis [35]. Accordingly, several lines of evidence demonstrated that MSC-Exos efficiently improved cognition, learning deficiency, and memory loss in damaged and ischemic hippocampal neurons [36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43].",
        "By using a model of acute brain injury, Niu and colleagues showed that intravenous injection of UC-MSC-Exos significantly improved cognitive function of experimental animals by regulating metabolism in hippocampal neurons [36]. Proteomic analysis revealed 67 UC-MSC-Exo-contained proteins, which promoted neurogenesis by modulating metabolism in injured neurons [36]. Among them, adiponectin was considered as the most important regulator of metabolism and neural function. Elevated levels of adiponectin, noticed in hippocampus and serum samples of UC-MSC-Exo-treated mice, corresponded to the improved cognitive function of these animals [36].",
        "In line with these findings are results obtained by Kim and coworkers showing that intravenous injection of MSC-Exos shortly rescued pattern separation and spatial learning impairments in experimental animals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) [37]. Single intravenous injection of MSC-Exos significantly improved sensorimotor and cognitive function of rats suffering from unilateral moderate cortical contusion [38]. Remarkably, reduced hippocampal neuronal cell loss, reduced neuroinflammation, and an increased number of newly generated blood vessels and neurons were observed in the brains of MSC-Exo-treated rats with TBI [38]. MSC-Exos significantly improved cognitive function of experimental animals by suppressing activation of microglia, by preventing reactive astrogliosis, and by attenuating inflammation-induced neural degeneration. Accordingly, myelination deficits and microstructural abnormalities of the white matter were restored by MSC-Exos [39].",
        "Zhang and colleagues also demonstrated that systemic administration of MSC-Exos improved cognitive function of rats suffering from TBI by promoting functional recovery and neurovascular remodeling [40]. Compared with the saline-treated TBI rats, MSC-Exos-treated animals showed significant improvement in spatial learning, as evidenced by MWM test [40]. Additionally, MSC-Exos attenuated inflammation and promoted neo-angiogenesis, which resulted in a significantly increased number of newly formed immature and mature neurons in dentate gyrus, indicating that MSC-Exo-induced improvement of cognitive function of TBI rats was due to the activity of MSC-Exo-sourced immunosuppressive, neurotrophic, and pro-angiogenic factors [40].",
        "As demonstrated by Gao and colleagues [41], among various MSC-sourced molecules, miRNA-21 was mainly responsible for beneficial effects of MSC-Exos in restoration of cognitive function following brain injury. MSC-Exo-derived miRNA-21 protected neurons from apoptosis and alleviated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced cognitive dysfunction in experimental rats [41]. MSC-Exo-sourced miRNA-21 prevented apoptosis by inducing activation of phosphatase and tensin homolog/protein kinase B (PTEN/Akt) signaling pathway in injured neurons. MSC-Exo-dependent neuroprotection was completely abrogated by miR-21 knockdown or after the administration of PTEN/Akt inhibitor, indicating a crucially important role of miRNA-21/PTEN/Akt signaling for beneficial effects of MSC-Exos in the restoration of cognitive function after SAH [41].",
        "Yang and colleagues showed that MSC-Exos improved postoperative cognitive dysfunction, a severe complication of cardiopulmonary bypass, by reducing hippocampal neuronal apoptosis [42]. MSC-Exo-dependent prevention of apoptosis was also responsible for improved cognitive function of rats suffering from ischemic brain injury [43]. MSC-Exos down-regulated expression of pro-apoptotic molecules (Bax, caspase-3 and -9) and enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, which significantly reduced the total number of dead neurons and increased neuronal density in the ischemic boundary zone [43].",
        "Ischemic injury, oxidative stress, glucose metabolism abnormalities (hyper or hypoglycemia), changes in glutamate neurotransmission, and decreased hippocampal synaptic plasticity induce hippocampal neural injury and cognitive impairment in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus [44]. Since MSC-Exos are enriched with factors that regulate metabolism and provide trophic support to injured neurons, several studies investigated therapeutic potential of MSC-Exos for the treatment of diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction [44,45,46]. Zhao and colleagues revealed that cognition impairment was almost completely recovered in BM-MSC-treated diabetic mice [45]. As demonstrated by Nakano and coworkers, intracerebroventricular injection of BM-MSC-Exos significantly reduced degeneration of neurons and astrocytes, as well as synaptic loss in the hippocampus of diabetic mice [44]. MSC-Exos, in miR-146a-dependent manner, down-regulated expression of IRAK1, NF-κB, and TNF-α in astrocytes and suppressed inflammation-induced damage of neurons in the hippocampus of diabetic mice, preventing the progression of diabetes-induced cognitive impairment [46].",
        "Parkinson disease is a neurocognitive disorder characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons [47]. Since several experimental studies demonstrated beneficial effects of MSCs in the therapy of Parkinson disease [48], Chen and colleagues investigated whether intravenously injected MSC-Exos may induce repair and regeneration of injured dopaminergic neurons [49]. MSC-Exos easily penetrated the BBB and reached the dopaminergic neurons within substantia nigra of experimental rats [49]. MSC-Exos relieved apomorphine-induced asymmetric rotation and reduced apoptotic cell loss of dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, degenerative and necrotic changes detected in the form of deeply eosinophilic cytoplasms, accompanied by pyknosis and karyolysis, were not observed in the substantia nigra of MSC-Exo-treated rats [49]. Histological analysis revealed significant improvement in brain tissue samples of MSC-Exo-treated animals, evidenced by the presence of multipolar neurons with nucleoli and basophilic granular cytoplasms. Importantly, MSC-Exos significantly increased levels of dopamine and its metabolites (dihydroxy phenyl acetic acid and homovanillic acid) in striatum, suggesting that MSC-Exo-based therapy significantly improved function of dopaminergic neurons in animals with Parkinson disease [49].",
        "Neurodevelopmental disorders manifested by cognitive dysfunction, increased repetitive behaviors, and deficits in communication and social interaction are defined as ASD [50]. By using Black and Tan BRachyury mice that carried the mutations at inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 3 (BTBR T+tf/J mice) which incorporate behavioral phenotype relevant to human ASD (reduced social approach, low reciprocal social interactions, and impaired juvenile play), Peters and colleagues demonstrated that intranasal administration of MSC-Exos may significantly ameliorate autism-like behavior and ASD-related symptoms [50]. Remarkably, improved male-to-male social interaction and reduced repetitive behaviors during social interaction were observed in MSC-Exo-treated BTBR mice. More complex and longer male-to-female ultrasonic vocalization was noticed in MSC-Exo-treated BTBR animals, making them more similar to healthy mice from control group. MSC-Exo-treated BTBR mice had significant improvement in the number of syllables compared to the saline-treated BTBR animals [50]. Additionally, MSC-Exos significantly improved pup retrieval behavior of female BTBR mice. While only two of 24 pups were brought back to the nest by saline-treated BTBR females, MSC-Exos-treated BTBR mothers retrieved all (18/18) pups, demonstrating significant improvement in maternal behavior [50].",
        "Beneficial effects of intranasally injected MSC-Exos in the improvement of cognitive function were observed in phencyclidine (PCP)-treated mice, a well-established murine model of schizophrenia [51]. Tsivion-Visbord and colleagues demonstrated that intranasal delivery of MSC-Exos managed to alleviate schizophrenia-like behaviors by preserving viability of Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing neurons and by modulating activity of neurotransmitters in the CNS [51]. Immediately after injection, the majority of MSC-Exos accumulated in the neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the brain area that is the most severely affected in schizophrenia. Significantly reduced glutamate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and a remarkably increased number of GABA-producing neurons were observed in PFC of PCP-treated mice that received MSC-Exos. Importantly, MSC-Exos improved social interaction and disruption in prepulse inhibition in PCP-treated mice, significantly attenuating schizophrenia-like behavior [51]. Since no negative symptoms were detected following intranasal administration of MSC-Exos in mice [50,51], efficacy of this non-invasive therapeutic approach should be further explored in upcoming clinical studies for the amelioration of behavioral symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and ASD.",
        "MSC-Exos act as an important mediator of the information exchange between MSCs and recipient cells (neurons and microglia). MSC-Exo-derived miRNAs, trophic factors, enzymes, and immunomodulatory and pro-angiogenic molecules promote neurogenesis and suppress inflammation-induced injury of hippocampal neurons, resulting in improvement of cognitive function [5,12].",
        "Importantly, immunomodulation and neuroprotection mediated by MSC-Exos was either similar or even better than immunomodulation accomplished by their parental MSCs [5]. MSC-Exos-based effects are not affected by local tissue microenvironment. In contrast to MSCs, which alter their phenotype and function upon engraftment in different tissue microenvironments, MSC-Exos are not subject to changes in their immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties upon diverse stimuli, indicating their potential for clinical use in the therapy of neurocognitive diseases [5,12].",
        "Despite these promising results, several issues should be addressed before MSC-Exos can be used routinely in clinical settings. Since various number of anti-apoptotic and immunosuppressive molecules have been proposed as crucially important for the therapeutic effects of MSC-Exos in neuroprotection and restoration of cognitive function, further experimental studies should identify the exact disease-specific MSC-Exo-contained molecule(s) responsible for improved spatial learning, reduced memory loss, and functional recovery of injured hippocampal neurons. Therefore, upcoming experimental studies and clinical trials should define the exact disease-specific therapeutic dose and appropriate treatment schedule and route of MSC-Exos administration before MSC-Exos will be offered as a universal human remedy for the treatment of neurocognitive diseases.",

        "Neurological disorders encompass a wide range of debilitating conditions that affect the central and peripheral nervous systems, leading to progressive damage and loss of neural tissue. These conditions include neurodegenerative illnesses, which are typified by the build-up of abnormal protein aggregates and the progressive loss of particular neuronal populations. Examples of these illnesses are Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Huntington’s disease (HD) [1, 2]. Other neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury (SCI), involve damage to the myelin sheath and axons, disrupting neural transmission and causing functional impairments [3, 4]. Cerebrovascular disorders, including stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI), result in acute neural tissue damage and subsequent neuroinflammation, leading to long-term disability [5, 6]. Neurological disorders pose a significant burden on global health, affecting millions of individuals worldwide and leading to substantial healthcare costs and societal impact [7, 8].",
        "Current therapeutic approaches for neurological disorders primarily focus on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression rather than addressing the underlying pathology. This is in part because the precise etiology of many neurological conditions remains unknown, limiting our ability to develop targeted disease-modifying therapies. Pharmacological treatments, such as dopaminergic medications for PD, cholinesterase inhibitors for AD, and immunomodulatory drugs for MS, provide symptomatic relief but often have limited efficacy and side effects [9–11]. Rehabilitation strategies aim to promote functional recovery and adaptations but do not directly restore lost neural tissue [12]. Surgical interventions, such as deep brain stimulation for PD, can alleviate specific symptoms but do not halt or reverse the neurodegenerative process [13]. While progress has been made in developing neuroprotective agents and gene therapies, their clinical translation has been challenging, and their long-term efficacy remains to be established [14, 15]. Given the limitations of current therapies, there is a pressing need for novel approaches that can effectively regenerate damaged neural tissue, replace lost neurons, and promote functional recovery in neurological disorders.",
        "By utilizing stem cells' capacity for regeneration, stem cell-based therapies have become a viable option for treating the underlying pathophysiology of neurological illnesses. Because of their capacity to self-renew and differentiate into distinct cell types, stem cells are desirable in regenerative medicine [16]. Numerous stem cell types have been investigated for their potential as therapeutics for neurological illnesses, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [17, 18]. These cells offer a variety of alternatives for cell-based therapeutics since they can be produced from various sources, including adult bone marrow, adipose tissue, embryonic tissue, and reprogrammed somatic cells [19, 20]. Stem cells have a variety of therapeutic applications in neurological illnesses, including immunomodulation, cell replacement, paracrine signaling, and stimulation of endogenous repair mechanisms [21–23]. Preclinical studies in animal models have demonstrated the ability of stem cells to differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages, integrate into host neural circuits, and promote functional recovery in various neurological conditions [24, 25]. However, the clinical translation of stem cell therapies faces numerous challenges, including optimizing cell manufacturing, delivery methods, and safety assessments [26].",
        "This comprehensive review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the current state of stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders, focusing on the most recent advances and clinical applications. The review will discuss the biological properties and therapeutic mechanisms of different stem cell types, critically examine the preclinical and clinical evidence for their efficacy and safety, and highlight the challenges and future directions in the field. By synthesizing the latest research findings and expert opinions, this review seeks to inform researchers, clinicians, and stakeholders about the potential and limitations of stem cell therapies in revolutionizing the treatment of neurological disorders.",
        "Stem cells are unspecialized cells with the unique ability to self-renew and differentiate into various cell types, making them a valuable tool for regenerative medicine [27]. Understanding stem cells' fundamental properties and mechanisms is crucial for their therapeutic application in neurological disorders. This section provides an overview of the different types of stem cells, their sources, and their mechanisms of action in neurological therapies.",
        "Based on their potential for differentiation and developmental stage, stem cells can be categorized. All of the body's cell types can be produced by ESCs, pluripotent cells formed from the inner cell mass of blastocysts [28]. Nevertheless, there are hazards of tumor growth and ethical issues with using ESCs [29]. Adult stem cells are multipotent cells in bone marrow, adipose tissue, and the central nervous system. Examples of these tissues are MSCs and NSCs [30, 31]. Though less contentious and safer than ESCs, these cells have a more constrained capacity for differentiation [32]. Adult somatic cells are reprogrammed into a pluripotent state using particular transcription factors to create iPSCs [33]. iPSCs possess similar properties to ESCs but avoid the ethical issues associated with embryonic tissue use [34]. Other stem cell sources include perinatal tissues, such as umbilical cord blood and amniotic fluid, which contain a mix of multipotent stem cells [35].",
        "Stem cells exert their therapeutic effects in neurological disorders through multiple mechanisms, broadly categorized into cell replacement, paracrine signaling, immunomodulation, and stimulation of endogenous repair processes.Cell replacement: Stem cells can differentiate into specific neuronal and glial cell types, potentially replacing damaged or lost neural cells in neurological disorders [36]. For instance, dopaminergic neurons derived from stem cells can be transplanted into the striatum to replace degenerated neurons in Parkinson's disease [37]. However, the extent of cell replacement and functional integration of transplanted cells varies across different neurological conditions and requires further optimization [38].Paracrine signaling: Stem cells secrete a wide range of bioactive molecules, including growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular vesicles, which can exert neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative effects on the host neural tissue [39, 40]. These paracrine factors can promote the survival and regeneration of endogenous neural cells, modulate the immune response, and enhance angiogenesis and neuroplasticity [41, 42]. The paracrine mechanisms of stem cells are believed to play a crucial role in their therapeutic efficacy, particularly in conditions where cell replacement alone may not be sufficient [43].Immunomodulation: Neuroinflammation is a common feature of many neurological disorders, contributing to neural damage and hindering repair processes [44]. Stem cells, particularly MSCs, possess immunomodulatory properties that can regulate the immune response and create a more favorable environment for neural repair [45]. These cells can interact with various immune cells, such as T, B, and microglia, and modulate their activity through direct cell–cell contact and secretion of soluble factors [46, 47]. By attenuating neuroinflammation and promoting a pro-regenerative immune response, stem cells can indirectly support neural repair and functional recovery [48].Stimulation of endogenous repair: To encourage the proliferation, differentiation, and integration of endogenous stem and progenitor cells into the injured neural tissue, stem cells can activate and mobilize these cells in the brain [49, 50]. Growth factors and chemokines that draw endogenous stem cells to the injury site and promote their survival and differentiation can be secreted to do this [51]. Furthermore, stem cells can expand the brain's neurogenic and angiogenic niches, improving the conditions for endogenous repair mechanisms [52].",

        "The therapeutic mechanisms of stem cells in neurological disorders are complex and multifaceted, often involving a combination of cell replacement, paracrine signaling, immunomodulation, and stimulation of endogenous repair. The relative contribution of each mechanism may vary depending on the specific neurological condition, the type of stem cells used, and the route and timing of administration [53]. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing stem cell-based therapies and developing targeted approaches for neurological disorders.",
        "However cell-based therapy for neurological illnesses encounters various obstacles despite its considerable potential:The potential of developing tumours, especially with pluripotent stem cells, is a concern [54]Allogeneic cell transplants can be rejected by the immune system [55]Cell survival and incorporation in the host tissue are restrictedThe possibility of unregulated differentiation or movement [56]There are ethical considerations related to the utilisation of embryonic stem cells [57]Issues related to scalability and manufacture of cell products that meet clinical-grade standards [58].",

        "There are questions about the safety of anything over a long period of time, and it is necessary to do additional studies to continue monitoring it [59].",
        "These constraints highlight the significance of thorough preclinical testing and meticulous clinical trial design. Furthermore, it is imperative for regulatory frameworks to adapt in order to effectively tackle the distinctive obstacles presented by cell-based therapies [20].",
        "Each type of stem cell has unique benefits and drawbacks when it comes to its use in neurological applications. ESCs possess a significant degree of adaptability, but they can give rise to ethical dilemmas and pose the possibility of developing tumours [60]. Adult stem cells, such as MSCs and NSCs, have a narrower range of cell types they can develop into, but they may present fewer safety risks [61]. iPSCs offer a means of obtaining cells that are particular to each patient, but they must undergo thorough analysis to guarantee their safety and effectiveness [31]. When selecting a cell type, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the individual neurological disease and therapeutic objectives [35].",
        "Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles build up in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative condition that impairs memory, causes neuronal death and declines cognitive function [62]. Current pharmacological treatments, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, provide symptomatic relief but do not address the underlying pathology or halt disease progression [63]. Stem cell-based therapies have been proposed as a potential strategy to address multiple aspects of Alzheimer's disease pathology, including replacing lost neurons, providing neuroprotection, and modulating neuroinflammation [64].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of AD have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types, including MSCs, NSCs, and iPSCs, to ameliorate AD pathology and improve cognitive function. MSCs have been shown to reduce Aβ deposition, attenuate neuroinflammation, and promote neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in AD mouse models [65–67]. NSCs derived from human fetal tissue or differentiated from pluripotent stem cells have been reported to differentiate into cholinergic neurons and integrate into the host brain, improving cognitive function in AD animal models [68, 69]. However, transplanted cells' long-term survival and functional integration remain challenging [70]. iPSC-derived neural cells have also shown promise in preclinical studies, with the advantage of allowing patient-specific and genetically corrected cell therapies [71, 72].",
        "To date, only a limited number of small-scale clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in AD patients. A phase I trial using human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) demonstrated the safety and tolerability of repeated intravenous infusions in AD patients, with some evidence of stabilization of cognitive function [73]. Another phase I trial using autologous adipose-derived MSCs (ADSCs) showed safety and potential efficacy in slowing cognitive decline in mild to moderate AD patients [74]. However, these early-stage trials have limitations, such as small sample sizes, lack of placebo controls, and short follow-up periods, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of stem cell therapies in AD [75].",
        "Obstacles and prospects for the future although the preclinical results show promise, various hurdles must be overcome to successfully apply stem cell therapy in the clinical treatment of AD. These include enhancing the efficiency and quality of stem cells, enhancing the viability and effective integration of transplanted cells, and devising precise delivery techniques to specific brain regions impacted by AD [76]. Additionally, the optimal timing of intervention, the long-term safety and efficacy, and the potential need for repeated treatments need to be established through well-designed clinical trials [67].",
        "Future directions in stem cell therapy for AD may involve using genetically modified stem cells to enhance their therapeutic properties, such as increased secretion of neurotrophic factors or Aβ-degrading enzymes [77]. Combining stem cell therapy with other therapeutic approaches, such as Aβ immunization or small molecule inhibitors of Aβ and tau pathology, may provide synergistic benefits [78]. 3D organoid models derived from patient-specific iPSCs may also facilitate drug screening and personalized treatment strategies [79].",
        "Although stem cell therapy shows potential as a disease-modifying treatment for AD, additional research is required to tackle the obstacles and enhance the therapeutic strategy. Thorough preclinical investigations and well-planned clinical trials are necessary to determine stem cell treatments' safety, effectiveness, and long-term advantages in Alzheimer's disease. However, the complex and multifaceted nature of AD presents significant challenges for developing effective cell replacement therapies. AD involves widespread neuronal loss, synaptic dysfunction, protein aggregation, and vascular abnormalities across multiple brain regions. Simple cell replacement is unlikely to address all of these pathological features. Additional research is required to determine if stem cell approaches can tackle the numerous obstacles presented by AD's complexity and enhance therapeutic strategies [80].",
        "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological condition that gradually causes the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). This leads to motor symptoms, including tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement [81]. Current treatments, including dopaminergic medications and deep brain stimulation, provide symptomatic relief but do not address the underlying neuronal loss or halt disease progression [82]. Stem cell-based therapies aim to replace lost dopaminergic neurons and restore motor function in PD [83]. It is important to note that Parkinson's disease is not simply characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. The pathophysiology is complex, involving multiple neurotransmitter systems, protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and dysfunction of various neural circuits. For stem cell therapies to be truly disease-modifying or curative, they would need to address these multiple aspects of PD pathology. Recent research has highlighted additional challenges, including the potential spread of alpha-synuclein pathology to transplanted cells and the need to restore broader neural circuit function beyond dopamine replacement [84].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of PD have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types, particularly ESCs and iPSCs, to differentiate into dopaminergic neurons and improve motor function. Transplantation of human ESC-derived dopaminergic neurons into the striatum of PD animal models has shown survival, integration, and functional recovery [85, 86]. Similarly, iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons have demonstrated the ability to engraft, innervate the host striatum, and ameliorate motor deficits in PD models [87, 88]. However, challenges such as variability in differentiation efficiency, graft survival, and potential tumorigenicity need to be addressed [89]. PD models have also investigated MSCs for their neuroprotective and immunomodulatory properties [90, 91].",
        "Several clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies in PD patients. Early trials using fetal ventral mesencephalic (FVM) tissue grafts demonstrated variable outcomes, with some patients showing long-term clinical benefits and others developing graft-induced dyskinesias [92, 93]. More recently, clinical trials using human ESC-derived dopaminergic progenitors have shown promise. A phase 1/2 trial reported the safety and survival of transplanted cells in PD patients, with some evidence of motor improvement [94]. An ongoing phase 1 trial (NCT03119636) investigates the safety and efficacy of human ESC-derived dopaminergic progenitors in PD patients [95]. Clinical trials using autologous iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons are also in the planning stages [96].",
        "While stem cell therapy for PD has made significant progress, several challenges remain. These include optimizing the differentiation and purification of dopaminergic neurons, ensuring graft survival and functional integration, and minimizing the risk of graft-induced dyskinesias [97]. Strategies to enhance graft survival, such as co-transplantation with supportive cell types or neuroprotective agents, are being explored [95]. The development of standardized protocols for cell manufacturing and quality control is also essential for the reproducibility and scalability of stem cell therapies [98]. Future directions in stem cell therapy for PD may involve gene editing technologies to correct disease-causing mutations in patient-specific iPSCs [99]. Cell encapsulation or bioengineered scaffolds may improve graft survival and integration [100]. Combinatorial approaches, such as the co-administration of neurotrophic factors or the use of neuroprotective agents, may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of stem cell therapies [101].",
        "Stem cell therapy shows potential as a disease-modifying treatment for PD, aiming to replace lost dopaminergic neurons and restore motor function. Although there have been promising findings in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, additional research is required to tackle the obstacles and enhance the therapeutic approach. Continuing and upcoming clinical trials will offer valuable knowledge regarding the safety, effectiveness, and long-term advantages of stem cell therapies in PD.",
        "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-lasting inflammatory condition of the CNS that involves the immune system attacking and damaging the protective covering of nerve fibers called myelin. This damage results in neurological problems and impairment [102]. Current therapies for MS primarily focus on immunomodulation and symptom management but do not effectively promote remyelination or prevent progressive neurodegeneration [103]. Stem cell-based therapies aim to promote remyelination, provide neuroprotection, and modulate the immune response in MS. Among neurological conditions, multiple sclerosis (MS) stands out as having the most advanced clinical applications of stem cell therapy. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) is now routinely used in medical centers worldwide to treat aggressive forms of MS. This approach aims to 'reset' the immune system and halt disease progression [104].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of MS, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types to promote remyelination and ameliorate disease progression. Transplantation of NSCs or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) derived from ESCs or iPSCs has shown the ability to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, promote remyelination, and improve functional outcomes in EAE models [105, 106]. MSCs have also been extensively studied in MS models for their immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties [107]. MSCs have been shown to reduce neuroinflammation, suppress autoreactive T cells, and promote the generation of regulatory T cells, leading to improved clinical outcomes in EAE [108, 109].",
        "Several clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies in MS patients. aHSCT has been explored as a potential treatment for aggressive forms of MS to reset the immune system and halt disease progression. Comparing aHSCT to disease-modifying therapies found that aHSCT was superior in preventing disease progression and achieving sustained improvement in neurological function. Long-term follow-up studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients remain free from disease activity for 5 years or more after treatment [110]. While some studies have shown promising results, with long-term stabilization or improvement of disability in a subset of patients, the procedure is associated with significant risks. It is currently reserved for select patients with highly active disease [111, 112]. Clinical trials using MSCs have also been conducted in MS patients, primarily focusing on safety and feasibility [113]. Intravenous administration of autologous MSCs is well-tolerated, with evidence of potential efficacy in reducing inflammatory activity and promoting neuroprotection [102, 114]. However, more extensive randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the long-term safety and efficacy of MSC-based therapies in MS.",
        "While stem cell therapies hold promise for the treatment of MS, several challenges need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is ensuring the survival, differentiation, and functional integration of transplanted cells in the host CNS [115]. Strategies to enhance graft survival and promote targeted migration to sites of demyelination are being explored [110]. Another challenge is the potential for graft rejection or the development of secondary autoimmunity [116]. The use of autologous or genetically modified stem cells and the development of improved immunosuppressive regimens may help mitigate these risks [117]. Future directions in stem cell therapy for MS may involve using gene editing technologies to create \"off-the-shelf\" cell products with enhanced remyelination capacity or immunomodulatory properties [118]. Developing biomaterials and tissue engineering approaches to create scaffolds that support cell survival and guide axonal regeneration is also an active area of research [119]. Combination therapies that target multiple aspects of MS pathology, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, may enhance the therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation [120].",
        "Stem cell-based therapies for MS have shown promising results in preclinical studies and early clinical trials. While challenges remain, advances in cell manufacturing, genetic engineering, and biomaterial science are expected to improve the safety, efficacy, and accessibility of stem cell therapies for MS in the future. Further research and well-designed clinical trials are needed to establish the optimal therapeutic approach and long-term benefits of stem cell transplantation in MS. The success of aHSCT in MS has led to its inclusion in treatment guidelines for highly active relapsing–remitting MS that is refractory to conventional therapies. However, patient selection is crucial, as the procedure carries risks and is most beneficial for younger patients with active inflammatory disease. Ongoing research is focused on optimizing aHSCT protocols, reducing treatment-related risks, and exploring its potential in progressive forms of MS. Additionally, other stem cell approaches, such as mesenchymal stem cell therapies, are being investigated for their potential neuroprotective and regenerative properties in MS [121].",
        "Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, characterized by the sudden loss of blood supply to the brain, resulting in neuronal damage and functional impairments [122]. Current treatments for stroke primarily focus on restoring blood flow and providing supportive care but do not effectively address the long-term neurological deficits [123]. Stem cell-based therapies promote neuronal repair, modulate inflammation, and enhance functional recovery in stroke [124].",
        "Animal research investigating stroke has shown that different types of stem cells, such as MSCs, NSCs, and iPSCs, can enhance neuronal repair and functional outcomes. Studies have demonstrated that the transplantation of MSCs can decrease the extent of tissue damage caused by a lack of blood supply, regulate the inflammation of nerves, and improve the growth of new nerve cells and blood vessels in animal stroke models [125, 126]. NSCs, either from fetal tissue or generated from induced iPSCs, have shown the capacity to move towards the location of injury, transform into nerve cells and support cells, and enhance the restoration of function in stroke models [127, 128]. Nevertheless, the precise timing, method, and amount of stem cell administration and the sustained viability and incorporation of transplanted cells continue to be significant obstacles [129].",
        "Several clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in stroke patients. A meta-analysis of early-phase clinical trials using MSCs in ischemic stroke patients reported a favorable safety profile and potential improvements in functional outcomes [130]. However, the efficacy of MSC transplantation in stroke remains to be established in larger, randomized controlled trials. The MASTERS trial, a phase 2 study of intravenous administration of bone marrow-derived MSCs in acute ischemic stroke patients, showed no significant improvement in functional outcomes at 90 days compared to placebo [128]. More recently, the TREASURE trial, a phase 2/3 study of intravenous administration of umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs in acute ischemic stroke patients, also failed to demonstrate a significant improvement in functional outcomes at 90 days [131]. These results highlight the need for further optimization of stem cell therapies for stroke, including the selection of patients most likely to benefit, the timing and route of administration, and the potential for combination therapies [127].",
        "While stem cell therapies hold promise for the treatment of stroke, several challenges need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the limited survival and engraftment of transplanted cells in the ischemic brain [132]. Strategies to enhance cell survival, such as preconditioning or genetic modification of stem cells, are being explored [133]. Another challenge is the potential for off-target effects or the development of adverse events, such as tumorigenesis or stroke-associated infection [134]. The use of highly purified and well-characterized cell populations and rigorous safety monitoring will be essential for the clinical translation of stem cell therapies for stroke [135]. Future directions in stem cell therapy for stroke may involve using biomaterials and tissue engineering approaches to create a supportive microenvironment for transplanted cells and enhance their survival and differentiation [136]. Developing cell-free approaches, such as using extracellular vesicles or exosomes derived from stem cells, may also provide a more scalable and safe alternative to cell transplantation [137]. Combinatorial approaches, such as the co-administration of neuroprotective agents or the use of rehabilitation therapies, may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of stem cell transplantation [138].",
        "While stem cell-based therapies for stroke have shown promising results in preclinical studies, the clinical translation of these approaches has been challenging. Further research is needed to optimize the therapeutic approach, including selecting the most appropriate stem cell type, the timing and route of delivery, and the potential for combination therapies. Well-designed clinical trials with larger sample sizes and more extended follow-up periods will be essential to establish the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies for stroke.",
        "Muscle weakening, paralysis, and eventually death are the results of selective motor neuron loss in the brain and spinal cord that characterizes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative illness [139]. There are currently just a few ALS treatments available, and they mainly concentrate on supportive care and symptom control [140]. The goals of stem cell-based treatments for ALS are to reduce neuroinflammation, restore damaged motor neurons, and offer neuroprotection [141].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of ALS, such as the SOD1 transgenic mouse model, have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types to delay disease progression and extend survival. Transplantation of NSCs or motor neuron progenitors derived from ESCs or iPSCs has been shown to integrate into the spinal cord, form synaptic connections with host neurons, and improve motor function in ALS models [141, 142]. MSCs have also been extensively studied in ALS models for their immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties [143]. Intrathecal or intravenous administration of MSCs has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation, protect against motor neuron loss, and prolong survival in ALS mice [144, 145]. However, the long-term survival and efficacy of transplanted cells in the diseased microenvironment of ALS remain significant challenges [146].",
        "Several early-phase clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in ALS patients. Intraspinal transplantation of fetal spinal cord-derived NSCs in ALS patients is safe and well-tolerated, with some evidence of potential efficacy in slowing disease progression [147, 148]. However, a follow-up phase 2 trial did not significantly improve functional outcomes or survival compared to placebo [149]. Intrathecal administration of autologous MSCs has also been explored in ALS patients, focusing on safety and tolerability [137, 150]. While these early trials have provided proof-of-concept for the feasibility of stem cell transplantation in ALS, more extensive randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy of these approaches.",
        "Despite the promising preclinical results, the clinical translation of stem cell therapies for ALS faces several challenges. One of the main challenges is the complex and multifactorial nature of ALS pathogenesis, which may limit the therapeutic efficacy of cell replacement alone [151]. Strategies to enhance the survival, integration, and function of transplanted cells in the hostile microenvironment of ALS are being explored, such as the co-transplantation of supportive glial cells or the use of neuroprotective factors [152]. Another challenge is the potential for immune rejection or the development of adverse events, such as graft-induced dyskinesias or tumorigenesis [153]. The use of autologous or genetically modified stem cells and improved immunosuppressive regimens may help mitigate these risks [154].",
        "Future directions in stem cell therapy for ALS may involve gene editing technologies to correct ALS-causing mutations in patient-specific iPSCs, which could then be differentiated into healthy motor neurons for transplantation [155]. Using biomaterials and tissue engineering approaches to create scaffolds that support cell survival and guide axonal regeneration is also an active area of research [156]. Combinatorial approaches, such as the co-administration of neuroprotective agents or the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, may enhance the therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation [157]. Developing novel delivery methods, such as intramuscular or intravascular administration of stem cells, may provide a less invasive and more scalable approach for cell therapy in ALS [158].",
        "Although preclinical research on stem cell-based therapy for ALS has yielded encouraging findings, the practical application of these strategies has been complex. More studies are required on the most suitable stem cell type, administration timing and route, and the possibility of combination therapies to optimize the therapeutic strategy. More significant sample numbers and extended follow-up periods in carefully planned clinical trials will be necessary to confirm the safety and effectiveness of stem cell treatments for ALS. Additionally, the development of successful stem cell-based treatments for this debilitating illness will depend on a deeper comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of ALS pathogenesis and the interactions between transplanted cells and the host milieu.",
        "Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene, leading to the production of a mutant huntingtin protein that causes progressive neuronal loss and dysfunction, particularly in the striatum and cortex [159]. Current treatments for HD are limited and primarily focus on managing symptoms, such as chorea and psychiatric disturbances [160]. Stem cell-based therapies aim to replace lost neurons, provide neuroprotection, and modulate neuroinflammation in HD [161].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of HD, such as the R6/2 and YAC128 transgenic mouse models, have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types to improve motor function, reduce neuronal loss, and extend survival. Transplantation of fetal striatal tissue or NSCs derived from ESCs or iPSCs has been shown to integrate into the striatum, form synaptic connections with host neurons, and ameliorate motor deficits in HD mice [162, 163]. MSCs have also been explored in HD models for their immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties [164]. Intrastriatal or intravenous administration of MSCs has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation, increase neurotrophic factor levels, and improve motor function in HD mice [165, 166]. However, the long-term survival and efficacy of transplanted cells in the diseased microenvironment of HD remain significant challenges [167].",
        "To date, few clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in HD patients. A phase 1 trial of fetal striatal tissue transplantation in HD patients demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the approach, with some evidence of graft survival and clinical benefit [168]. However, a follow-up study found that the transplanted cells developed HD-like pathology over time, suggesting that cell replacement alone may not halt disease progression [169]. Recently, a phase 1/2 trial of intrastriatal transplantation of human ESC-derived neural progenitors in HD patients has been initiated (NCT03252080) [170]. This trial aims to assess the approach's safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy, with results expected in the coming years.",
        "While stem cell-based therapies for HD hold promise, several challenges must be addressed for successful clinical translation. One of the main challenges is the potential for transplanted cells to acquire HD-related pathology over time due to the presence of the mutant huntingtin protein in the host environment [171]. Strategies to mitigate this risk, such as genetically corrected autologous iPSCs or the co-transplantation of neuroprotective factors, are being explored [172]. Another challenge is the need for targeted cell delivery to the affected brain regions, as widespread neuronal loss and circuit dysfunction occur in HD [173]. Developing advanced imaging techniques and stereotactic surgery methods may help guide precise cell transplantation [154]. Future directions in stem cell therapy for HD may involve gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR–Cas9, to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific iPSCs, which could then be differentiated into healthy striatal neurons for transplantation [155]. Using biomaterials and tissue engineering approaches to create scaffolds that support cell survival and guide axonal regeneration is also an active area of research [156]. Combinatorial approaches, such as the co-administration of neuroprotective agents or the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, may enhance the therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation [174]. Developing novel delivery methods, such as intracerebroventricular or intrathecal administration of stem cells, may provide a less invasive and more widespread approach for cell therapy in HD [175].",
        "In summary, whereas preclinical research on stem cell-based treatments for Huntington's disease has yielded encouraging outcomes, the clinical application of these strategies is still in its infancy. More studies are required on the most suitable stem cell type, administration timing and route, and the possibility of combination therapies to optimize the therapeutic strategy. To prove that stem cell therapies for HD are safe and effective, well-designed clinical trials with bigger sample sizes and longer follow-up times will be necessary. Additionally, the development of successful stem cell-based treatments for this debilitating illness will depend on a deeper comprehension of the molecular mechanisms driving HD pathogenesis and the interactions between transplanted cells and the host milieu.",
        "A severe disorder known as spinal cord injury (SCI) causes the loss of motor and sensory function below the site of the damage, which frequently leads to permanent paralysis and impairment [176]. The main goals of current SCI treatments are to stabilize the spine, stop more injury, and encourage recovery [177]. The goals of stem cell-based treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI) include glia and missing neuron replacement, axonal regeneration, and inflammation response modulation [178].",
        "The potential of different types of stem cells to support functional recovery and regeneration has been proven in preclinical research utilizing animal models of spinal cord injury. It has been demonstrated that transplanting NSCs or neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from ESCs or iPSCs into the injured spinal cord can improve motor function in rodent and primate models of SCI by promoting the differentiation of neurons and glia and forming synaptic connections with host neurons. Since MSCs exhibit immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and pro-angiogenic qualities, they have also been the subject of substantial research in SCI models [179]. It has been demonstrated that administering MSCs intravenously or intraspinally to SCI mice can decrease inflammation, encourage tissue sparing, and improve functional recovery [180, 181]. Nonetheless, there are still significant obstacles to overcome, including the best time, method, and dosage for delivering stem cells and the integration and long-term survival of transplanted cells [182].",
        "Several clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in SCI patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials using MSCs in SCI patients found no serious adverse events related to cell transplantation and some evidence of functional improvement [183]. However, the included studies were small, heterogeneous, and lacked appropriate controls, highlighting the need for more extensive, well-designed trials to establish the efficacy of MSC therapy in SCI [184]. A phase 2 trial of intramedullary transplantation of human ESC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in subacute SCI patients (NCT02302157) has recently been completed, with results pending publication [185]. Other ongoing or planned trials investigate the safety and efficacy of various stem cell types in SCI patients, including NSCs, NPCs, and autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs [186].",
        "While stem cell-based therapies for SCI hold promise, several challenges must be addressed for successful clinical translation. One of the main challenges is the complex and dynamic nature of the injury microenvironment, which may limit the survival, differentiation, and integration of transplanted cells [187]. Strategies to enhance cell survival and promote targeted differentiation, such as co-delivering neuroprotective factors or biomaterials and tissue engineering approaches, are being explored [188, 189]. Another challenge is the potential for adverse events, such as neuropathic pain, autonomic dysreflexia, or tumor formation, following stem cell transplantation [190]. Careful patient selection, rigorous safety monitoring, and long-term follow-up will be essential to mitigate these risks [184].",
        "Future directions in stem cell therapy for SCI may involve gene editing technologies to engineer stem cells with enhanced regenerative properties, such as increased neurotrophic factor secretion or improved myelination capacity [191]. The development of advanced biomaterials and tissue engineering approaches to create scaffolds that mimic the natural extracellular matrix and guide axonal regeneration is also an active area of research [154]. Combinatorial approaches, such as the co-administration of rehabilitation therapy or the use of electrical stimulation, may enhance the therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation [192]. Additionally, identifying reliable biomarkers and imaging techniques to monitor the survival, differentiation, and integration of transplanted cells in vivo will be critical for optimizing and individualizing stem cell therapies for SCI [193].",
        "Stem cell-based therapies for SCI have shown promising results in preclinical studies, with growing evidence of safety and feasibility in early clinical trials. However, further research is needed to optimize the therapeutic approach, including selecting the most appropriate stem cell type, the timing and route of delivery, and the potential for combination therapies. Well-designed, randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and standardized outcome measures will be essential to establish the efficacy of stem cell therapies for SCI. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying SCI pathophysiology and the interactions between transplanted cells and the host microenvironment will be critical for developing safe and effective stem cell-based therapies for this devastating condition.",
        "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, resulting from sudden physical damage to the brain due to external forces, such as falls, vehicle accidents, or violence [194]. The primary injury initiates a cascade of secondary injury mechanisms, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and apoptosis, leading to progressive neuronal loss and dysfunction [195]. Current treatments for TBI primarily focus on minimizing secondary injury, managing intracranial pressure, and providing rehabilitation to promote functional recovery [196]. However, there are no effective therapies to reverse the damage and restore function in chronic TBI patients [197]. Stem cell-based therapies aim to replace lost neurons and glia, modulate the inflammatory response, and promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis in TBI [198].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of TBI have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types, including neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), MSCs, and HSCs, to promote functional recovery after TBI. Transplantation of NSPCs derived from ESCs or iPSCs into the injured brain has been shown to differentiate into neurons and glia, form synaptic connections with host neurons, and improve cognitive and motor function in rodent models of TBI [199, 200]. MSCs have also been extensively studied in TBI models for their immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and pro-angiogenic properties [201]. Intravenous or intracerebral administration of MSCs has been shown to reduce inflammation, promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis, and enhance functional recovery in TBI animals [202, 203]. HSCs mobilized from the bone marrow have been shown to migrate to the injured brain, differentiate into microglia and neurons, and improve cognitive function in rodent models of TBI [204]. While preclinical studies of stem cell therapies for TBI have shown promise, significant challenges remain in translating these approaches to clinical practice. Further research is needed to optimize cell types, delivery methods, and timing of intervention. Importantly, the complex and heterogeneous nature of TBI may require combinatorial approaches rather than relying solely on cell replacement strategies.",
        "Several early-phase clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in TBI patients. A phase 1/2a study of intravenous administration of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) in acute severe TBI patients demonstrated safety and a trend towards improved neurological outcomes [205]. Another phase 1 study of intracerebral transplantation of human NSCs in chronic TBI patients showed safety and feasibility, with some evidence of improved neurological function [206]. However, more extensive randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy of these approaches in improving functional outcomes and quality of life in TBI patients [207].",
        "While stem cell-based therapies for TBI hold promise, several challenges must be addressed for successful clinical translation. One of the main challenges is the heterogeneity of TBI, which can vary in terms of the mechanism, location, and severity of injury, as well as the age and comorbidities of the patient [208]. Developing personalized stem cell therapies tailored to each patient's specific needs may be necessary to maximize therapeutic efficacy [209]. Another challenge is the potential for adverse events, such as seizures, infection, or tumorigenesis, following stem cell transplantation [190]. Careful patient selection, rigorous safety monitoring, and long-term follow-up will be essential to mitigate these risks [210].",

Research is also being done using biomaterials and tissue engineering techniques to make scaffolds that resemble the extracellular matrix seen in nature and offer a favorable environment for cell survival and development [212]. The therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation may be increased by combinatorial techniques, including co-administration of neuroprotective drugs, neurorestorative treatments, or rehabilitation [213]. Furthermore, developing noninvasive imaging modalities like PET and MRI to track the migration, survival, and differentiation of transplanted cells in vivo would be essential for customizing and streamlining stem cell treatments for traumatic brain injury [214].",

        "Repeated, unprovoked seizures are a hallmark of epilepsy, a chronic neurological illness caused by abnormally high levels of aberrant brain neuronal activity [215]. Even though antiepileptic medications (AEDs) are the cornerstone of epilepsy treatment, over one-third of patients still do not respond to medication [216]. Intending to reestablish the proper balance between excitement and inhibition in the epileptic brain, stem cell-based therapies have become a viable adjunctive or alternative therapeutic option for drug-resistant epilepsy [217].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of epilepsy have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types, particularly GABAergic interneuron progenitors and MSCs, to suppress seizures and modify the underlying disease pathology. Transplantation of GABAergic interneuron progenitors derived from ESCs or iPSCs into the hippocampus or other seizure-prone regions has been shown to engraft, differentiate into functional GABAergic interneurons, and reduce seizure frequency and severity in rodent models of epilepsy [218, 219]. These effects are mediated by the synaptic integration of the transplanted cells into the host circuitry and the enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission [220]. MSCs have also shown promise in preclinical epilepsy models, exerting anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects through the secretion of neurotrophic factors and the modulation of inflammatory responses [221, 222]. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of stem cell therapies in epilepsy remain to be established [223].",

        "A set of lifelong mobility abnormalities known as cerebral palsy are brought on by harm to the developing brain and first manifest in early childhood [233]. Current treatments for cerebral palsy primarily focus on managing symptoms and improving function through physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medications [234]. Stem cell-based therapies, particularly umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells and MSCs, have shown promise in preclinical and early clinical studies for cerebral palsy [235]. These cells have been shown to exert neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and pro-angiogenic effects, promoting brain repair and functional recovery [236, 237]. However, more extensive randomized controlled trials are needed to establish stem cell therapies' efficacy and long-term safety for cerebral palsy [238].",

However, the exact mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of stem cells are not fully understood. They may vary depending on the specific neurological condition and the type of stem cells used.",

The potential for tumorigenicity, immune rejection, and other adverse events following stem cell transplantation also requires careful consideration and long-term monitoring. Furthermore, the complex and multifactorial nature of many neurological disorders may require combinatorial approaches that target multiple pathogenic mechanisms, such as gene therapy, neuroprotective agents, or rehabilitation in conjunction with stem cell transplantation.",
        "Several critical research areas must be prioritized to address these challenges and accelerate the clinical translation of stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders. These include the development of standardized protocols for the generation, characterization, and banking of clinical-grade stem cells, the establishment of robust preclinical models that more accurately recapitulate human neurological disorders, and the design of well-controlled clinical trials with appropriate patient populations, outcome measures, and follow-up periods.",
        "In addition to technological advancements, the successful clinical translation of stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders will require a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach involving basic scientists, clinicians, industry partners, regulatory agencies, and patient advocates. Ethical, legal, and social implications of stem cell research and therapy must also be carefully addressed through ongoing dialogue and public engagement.",
        "Looking to the future, the field of stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders is poised for exciting developments and breakthroughs. The convergence of stem cell biology with other cutting-edge technologies, such as gene editing, single-cell genomics, organoid models, and advanced neuroimaging, holds great promise for developing personalized and targeted therapies for neurological disorders. The increasing understanding of the complex interplay between the nervous system, immune system, and microbiome may also open up new avenues for stem cell-based therapies that harness the body's intrinsic regenerative capacity.",
        "In conclusion, while stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders are still in their early stages of development, the progress made so far is encouraging and holds great promise for the future. With continued research, collaboration, and innovation, it is hoped that stem cell-based therapies will become a safe, effective, and accessible treatment option for millions worldwide affected by neurological disorders, improving their quality of life and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. As the field continues to evolve, it will be essential to maintain a balanced and evidence-based perspective, acknowledging both the potential and the limitations of stem cell-based therapies and to ensure that the interests of patients and the public are always at the forefront of scientific endeavors.",

    "title": "TGF-beta1 mediates hypoxia-preconditioned olfactory mucosa mesenchymal stem cells improved neural functional recovery in Parkinson's disease models and patients. characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Activation of the neuroinflammatory response has a pivotal role in PD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for various nerve injuries, but there are limited reports on their use in PD and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: We investigated the effects of clinical-grade hypoxia-preconditioned olfactory mucosa (hOM)-MSCs on neural functional recovery in both PD models and patients, as well as the preventive effects on mouse models of PD. To assess improvement in neuroinflammatory response and neural functional recovery induced by hOM-MSCs exposure, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), assay for transposase accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) combined with full-length transcriptome isoform-sequencing (ISO-seq), and functional assay. Furthermore, we present the findings from an initial cohort of patients enrolled in a phase I first-in-human clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of intraspinal transplantation of hOM-MSC transplantation into severe PD patients. RESULTS: A functional assay identified that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), secreted from hOM-MSCs, played a critical role in modulating mitochondrial function recovery in dopaminergic neurons. This effect was achieved through improving microglia immune regulation and autophagy homeostasis in the SN, which are closely associated with neuroinflammatory responses. Mechanistically, exposure to hOM-MSCs led to an improvement in neuroinflammation and neural function recovery partially mediated by TGF-beta1 via activation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (ALK/PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway in microglia located in the SN of PD patients. Furthermore, intraspinal transplantation of hOM-MSCs improved the recovery of neurologic function and regulated the neuroinflammatory response without any adverse reactions observed in patients with PD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of TGF-beta1 in mediating the beneficial effects of hOM-MSCs on neural functional recovery in PD. Treatment and prevention of hOM-MSCs could be a promising and effective neuroprotective strategy for PD. Additionally, TGF-beta1 may be used alone or combined with hOM-MSCs therapy for treating PD.

        "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) [1, 2]. The primary clinical manifestations of PD include quiescent tremors, myotonia, tardiness, and abnormal postural gait [3, 4]. Immune system dysregulation has also emerged as a crucial factor in PD susceptibility and progression, garnering increasing attention over the past decade. PD is marked by the death of dopaminergic neurons containing Lewy bodies (LBs), which mainly consist of α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregates in the SN and serve as definitive diagnostic features during postmortem examinations [5, 6]. Throughout disease progression, misfolded α-Syn becomes the major constituent of LBs and spreads to various brain regions in a prion-like manner [7]. Microglia represents the first line of defense in the brain’s immune system and plays a pivotal role in the central nervous system (CNS)’s inflammatory response [8, 9]. Misfolded α-Syn protein binds to microglial cell surface receptors activating them and triggering persistent inflammatory responses [10–12]. Due to a limited understanding of PD etiology, symptomatic clinical management traditionally relies on pharmacologic interventions, such as levodopa and neurosurgical procedures. However, long-term oral administration of levodopa can lead to adverse effects while drug resistance usually renders this treatment ineffective. Although these approaches provide partial relief from symptoms for patients with PD, neuronuclear destruction caused by deep brain stimulation surgeries may result in irreversible neurological damage [13, 14].",
        "With the advancement of stem cell technology, nerve repair and regeneration have become feasible. Stem cell transplantation has also shown promising results in the treatment of PD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are adult stem cells with paracrine, immune regulatory, and multidirectional differentiation potential [15–17], were previously hypothesized to primarily address the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons underlying PD. Most researchers believe that MSCs’ therapeutic effect on PD is attributed to their ability to replace damaged cells [18, 19]. However, research involving MSCs has shifted its focus from cell replacement to multitargeted therapy such as paracrine signaling and immune regulation [20, 21]. Exploring immunomodulation in PD presents an opportunity for identifying novel therapeutic targets and strategies for mitigating or reversing neurodegenerative changes. In 2010, researchers discovered that olfactory mucosal (OM)-derived MSCs isolated from human nasal mucosa represent a superior source of MSCs [22]. Since 2015, our research team has been conducting a comprehensive investigation involving autologous human OM-MSCs and successfully developed a complete culture system [23].",
        "The success of MSC therapy depends on the survival rate of cells, the number of homing cells, and the immunomodulatory effects after implantation in vivo. The microenvironment at the site of injury for inflammatory immune diseases is characterized by excessive inflammation, oxidative stress, and hypoxia, which pose significant challenges to the efficacy of MSCs [23]. During in vitro amplification, the MSCs were cultured under normoxic conditions with a serum concentration ranging from 10 to 20%. However, upon implantation into disease models or patients, MSCs encounter hypoxic or ischemic microenvironments. Developing an optimized culture protocol for hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs that enhances their survival rate, homing capacity, and paracrine effect represents a promising avenue for research aimed at overcoming some of the challenges associated with MSC-based therapy.",
        "We conducted a groundbreaking study to investigate the effects of clinical-grade hypoxia-preconditioned OM-MSCs (hOM-MSCs) on the recovery of neural functional in PD models and patients, as well as their preventive effects on PD mouse models. To assess improvement in neuroinflammatory response and neural functional recovery induced by hOM-MSCs exposure, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), assay for transposase accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) combined with full-length transcriptome isoform-sequencing (ISO-seq), and functional assay. Furthermore, we present the findings from an initial cohort of patients enrolled in a phase I first-in-human clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of intraspinal transplantation of hOM-MSC transplantation into severe PD patients.",
        "The experiments were conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines and received approval from both the institutional ethical committee and the animal care committee at Hunan Normal University (2020–390). Human nasal mucosa biopsies were obtained with informed consent, and all experiments were granted approval by the Ethics Committee at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Normal University (2020–390). Furthermore, all clinical investigations have been conducted according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.",
        "OM-MSCs were obtained from PD patients who volunteered at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Normal University. Three days prior to collecting the OM tissue, chloramphenicol was administered in the patient’s nasal cavity for a duration of 3 d. The collection tube for OM was prepared and inspected for any signs of damage. Before obtaining the tissue, gauze sheets were soaked in 1.2 – 1.5% tetracaine and saline solution, then inserted into the patient’s nasal cavity twice for surface local anesthesia with each session lasting 5 – 8 min. The ethmoid forceps were used to clip the mucosal tissue on the lateral side of the upper part of the middle turbinate, resulting in a tissue size of approximately 3 mm3. Subsequently, this tissue block was carefully placed into a collection tube using a syringe needle with relevant information on said tube, immediately after which it was transferred into an OM constant temperature transportation box. Finally, the collection tube was removed from refrigeration at 4 ℃ and temporarily stored.",
        "The OM samples were triple rinsed in DMEM/F12 (v/v = 1:1) mixed medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 200 U/ml penicillin and 200 U/ml streptomycin to remove any residual blood. Subsequently, the samples were transferred into DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% autoserum, along with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin. The minced tissue was obtained by using ophthalmic scissors and cut into pieces of approximately 0.5 mm3 size. These tissue fragments were then centrifuged to remove the supernatant. The resulting pellets were seeded in corning culture flasks (Corning, NY, USA). Once the cells reached full confluence within the flask surface area, they were trypsinized and passaged. The hOM-MSCs were cultured under a 3% oxygen concentration for a duration of 48 h.",
        "To ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of hOM-MSCs preparations, it is imperative to further standardize the procedures for quality inspection of hOM-MSCs. The detection procedure primarily involves characterizing hOM-MSCs utilizing flow cytometry and immunofluorescence techniques to quantify the expression of cell surface markers (CD34, CD45, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD133, CD146) as well as specific markers [stromal cell antigen 1 (STRO-1) and Nestin]. The tests for bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and exogenous viruses yielded negative results, while the concentration of endotoxin was found to be below the prescribed threshold. Biological activity detection mainly focuses on assessing cell viability, proliferation capacity, and differentiation potential. For fresh cells, a minimum acceptable viability rate is set at 90%, while for liquid nitrogen frozen cells, it is 80%. Cells were inoculated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/T75 vials and harvested after 48 h of culture for digestion and counting. The obtained cell count should range from 1.5 to 2.5 times of the initial inoculation count. These cells possess the capability to differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and neurons. Additionally, 10 ml of 0.9% normal saline should be added evenly to each tube containing the centrifuged hOM-MSCs and distributed. Centrifuge for 5 min, perform three rounds of cleaning according to the specified requirements, enumerate the cells, discard the supernatant, add 2 ml of 0.9% normal saline, and distribute uniformly to obtain the final cell preparation. Transfer it into a specialized transport incubator at 4 ℃ for experimental research and clinical trials.",
        "Eighty-four male C57BL/6 mice, aged 10 – 12 weeks, were procured from Hunan SJA Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Hunan, China) and housed in a facility with controlled temperature, humidity, and a 12 h light/dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals after receiving approval from the Ethics Committee at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Normal University (Ethical Approval Document 2020–390).",
        "BV2 cells (1 × 105; SCSP-5014, National Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures, China) were planted in the bottom layer of the upper chamber of the Transwell, while SH-SY5Y cells (1 × 105; GDC0311, China Center for Type Culture Collection, China) were planted in the lower chamber. According to the experimental requirements, BV2 cells and SH-SY5Y cells were positioned differently. After 24 h, activated α-Syn (250 nmol/L; ab218819, Abcam, USA) was added to the culture medium and incubated for 1 h in a carbon dioxide incubator [24]. To prevent internalization of α-Syn into MSCs, the lower chamber of the Transwell was rinsed three times with fresh medium. Subsequently, 1 × 105 OM-MSCs cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions were co-cultured with BV2 and SH-SY5Y cells for 12 h.",
        "In this study, OM-MSCs were evaluated for their neuroprotective effects in a PD model, resulting in four groups: control, model group (α-Syn), normoxic OM-MSCs intervention group (normoxia), and hypoxic OM-MSCs intervention group (hypoxia). The SH-SY5Y cells in each group were fluorescent-stained with neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN), a marker of neurons, and BAX, a marker of apoptosis. The neuroprotective effect of hOM-MSCs mediated by TGF-β1 on neurons in PD cell models was investigated, along with the ability of microglia to regulate immune responses and clear α-Syn.

The sham operation group received an equivalent volume of normal saline via intraperitoneal injection. Then, behavioral assessments were conducted in order to determine the success of the PD model. One week following the final MPTP injection, a stereotactic injection of 1 × 105 cells/10 μl phosphate buffer saline (PBS) was administered into the right lateral ventricle at coordinates -0.6 mm posterior, -1.5 mm lateral, and -1.7 mm ventral to the bregma.

The therapeutic potential of TGF-β1 in a mouse model of PD was investigated by examining its binding to the ALK receptor on microglial cell membranes, followed by modulation of hOM-MSCs. The experiment consisted of 4 treatment groups PD + hOM-MSCs, PD + hOM-MSCs + shRNA TGF-β1, PD + TGF-β1, and PD + AAV ALK + TGF-β1.

        "Prospective data have been collected, including the UPDRS total score, Hoehn and Yahr rating scale, and Schwab and England daily activity scale. CSF and serum samples were tested for DA, TGF-β1, CD206, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-10. The CSF and serum samples were collected from 4 patients before and after treatment, followed by a series of relevant assays to measure inflammatory cytokines. The protein expression levels of immunoregulatory factor TGF-β1 and dynamic markers of microglia inflammatory phenotype IL-1β and CD206 in the CSF were assessed by Western blotting analysis. The concentrations of DA neurotransmitters and related inflammatory factors in both CSF and serum samples from patients were analyzed using ELISA. A video recording was obtained for a comparative assessment of treatment efficacy.",

If the patient experiences poor therapeutic effects, cannot tolerate adverse reactions, wishes to pursue alternative treatment methods, or withdraws from the trial without any reason. The researcher may allow the participant to withdraw from further participation in the experiment.",
        "The hOM-MSCs preparation (as described above) involves transplanting cells 5 × 107/time, 2 – 3 times over a treatment course of 14 – 21 d. Patients receive intraspinal injections of the transplanted cells, following specific steps: the patient lies on his side on a hard plank bed, with his back perpendicular to the bed surface. The puncture point is the space between the spinous processes of the 3rd to 4th lumbar vertebrae. Wear sterile gloves, routinely disinfect the skin, cover the hole with a towel, and use 2% lidocaine for local anesthesia from the skin to the intervertebral ligament. The surgeon fixes the skin at the puncture point with his left hand, holds the puncture needle in his right hand, and inserts the needle slowly in a direction perpendicular to the back, with a depth of about 4 – 6 cm. Collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for testing in accordance with the specified requirements. Aspirate the prepared cell suspension using a syringe and gradually administer it into the spinal canal. Following injection, insert the needle core, remove the puncture needle, cover with sterile gauze, and secure with adhesive tape.",

        "GraphPad Prism 8.0 software was used to analyze the experimental data, and the experimental data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (mean ± SEM). ANOVA and paired t-tests were used to analyze the sample data. P < 0.05 indicates statistical significance.",
        "Our culture system for OM-MSCs successfully produces spindle-shaped cells with a radial arrangement under light microscopy (Additional file 1: Fig. S1a). The intracellular location of STRO-1 (a marker for stromal cells) and Nestin (a marker for stem cells) was detected using immunofluorescence (Additional file 1: Fig. S1b, c). Upon staining the cells induced by lipogenic inducers with Oil Red O, red lipid droplets were observed in the cytoplasm, suggesting that adipogenic differentiation had been achieved (Additional file 1: Fig. S1d). After induction by an osteogenic inducer, Alizarin Red staining demonstrated the formation of red mineralized nodules in the cells, indicating successful osteogenic differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S1e). The above steps are critical for characterizing OM-MSCs since they provide evidence of their potential for dividing into adipocytes and bone cells and confirm their ability to repair and regenerate. OM-MSCs showed numerous microvilli on their surface under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Additional file 1: Fig. S1f). Observations of cells by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that OM-MSCs were in a relatively active phase (Additional file 1: Fig. S1g) characterized by two nuclei present in each cell; both nuclei exhibited round or oval with prominent nucleoli. In addition, the rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria were observed among other organelles. Finally, flow cytometry assays showed high expression levels of CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD133, and CD146 in OM-MSCs, while OM-MSCs did not express CD34 and CD45, with the purity rate of OM-MSCs exceeding 97% (Additional file 1: Fig. S1h).",
        "The immunofluorescence results revealed that compared to the control group, the α-Syn group exhibited a remarkable increase in SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis, accompanied by an alteration in cytoskeletal morphology and a reduction in axon length. In the normoxia group, apoptosis was significantly decreased and cytoskeleton morphology was improved. In addition, the hypoxia group showed the most significant decrease in apoptosis, improvement in cytoskeleton morphology, and elongation of the axon (Fig. 1a; Additional file 1: Fig. S2a). These findings were further supported by Western blotting and flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1b; Additional file 1: Fig. S2b), which confirmed that OM-MSCs have a protective effect on neurons, and this neuroprotective function is significantly enhanced in hOM-MSCs.Fig. 1The hOM-MSCs enhanced mitochondrial function in neurons and the immunomodulation of microglia in the PD cell model. a Exemplary immunofluorescence micrograph showing nuclei (DAPI, blue), NeuN, and BAX expression in SH-SY5Y cells, and nuclei (DAPI, blue), α-Syn, CD206, and IL-1β expression in BV2 cells (scale bars = 40 μm). b Western blotting measuring BAX protein expression in SH-SY5Y cells, and α-Syn (α-synuclein), IL-1β, and CD206 protein expression in BV2 cells. c TEM showing the mitochondria morphology and ultrastructure (red arrow) in SH-SY5Y cells, and the formation of autophagosomes (green arrow) in BV2 cells (scale bars = 2 μm). d Western blotting measuring LAMP-2 protein expression in BV2 cells.

        "OM-MSCs exert a protective role on neuronal mitochondria in a PD model by assessing membrane potential [5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1)] and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are indicators of mitochondrial function. In the α-Syn group, there was a significant decrease in JC-1 fluorescence intensity, indicating a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and an increase in ROS production compared to the control group. On the other hand, under normoxic conditions, JC-1 fluorescence intensity increased and ROS production decreased. However, hypoxia-induced the most significant increase in JC-1 fluorescence intensity and decrease in ROS production (Additional file 1: Fig. S2c). Additionally, TEM was used to examine the changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure. The results showed that the mitochondria in the α-Syn group exhibited significant swelling and disorganization compared to the control group. In contrast, the mitochondria appeared to improve under normoxic conditions, but their recovery was most remarkable following hypoxia treatment (Fig. 1c). In conclusion, OM-MSCs protect neuronal mitochondrial function, and their protective effect is enhanced by hypoxia pretreatment.",
        "The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of OM-MSCs in eliminating α-Syn from activated microglia cells. Immunofluorescence findings revealed that α-Syn expression in BV2 cells was upregulated in the α-Syn group compared to the control group. As compared to the normoxia group, its expression decreased in the hypoxia group (Fig. 1a; Additional file 1: Fig. S2d). Western blotting analyses (Fig. 1b) further supported this finding which indicated OM-MSCs possess scavenging abilities on microglia cells, which are significantly enhanced under hypoxic conditions. The immunomodulatory effect of OM-MSCs on activated microglia cells, specifically their transition from the proinflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, was investigated by assessing the expression levels of the anti-inflammatory marker CD206 and proinflammatory marker IL-1β in BV2 cells. The expression of CD206 was significantly downregulated, while the expression of IL-1β was significantly upregulated in BV2 cells of the α-Syn group compared to the control group upon Western blotting. Conversely, in the normoxia group, CD206 expression was increased and IL-1β expression was decreased, with even greater effects observed in the hypoxia group (Fig. 1a; Additional file 1: Fig. S2e). These findings were also confirmed by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1b), indicating that OM-MSCs exert an immunomodulatory effect by promoting the transformation of microglia from M1 to M2 phenotype, with hOM-MSCs showing a more pronounced immunomodulatory effect.",
        "In a PD model, the regulatory effect of OM-MSCs on microglial autophagy homeostasis was further investigated in a PD model. The formation of autophagosomes was observed by TEM in BV2 cells, and the expression of lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2) was detected by Western blotting. The TEM results revealed a conspicuous absence of autolysosome formation in the control group, whereas an astonishing surge in autolysosomes was observed in the model group; however, the structure of lysosomes within the autophagosome was severely damaged and exhibited incomplete membranes. In the normoxia group, there were formed but decreased numbers of autolysosomes, and an improvement in lysosomal structure compared to the model group was observed. In contrast, a significant reduction in lysosome formation occurred in the hypoxia group; nevertheless, there were still present autopolysomes with intact lysosomal structures (Fig. 1c). By analyzing Western blots, we confirmed the validity of this finding (Fig. 1d), which showed that hOM-MSCs ameliorated excessive autophagic response, and maintained autophagy homeostasis to facilitate degradation and clearance of α-Syn in microglia.",
        "The chronic PD mouse model was established through intraperitoneal injection of MPTP in combination with probenecid. The experiment included sham and PD model groups. Neurologic function scores indicated that the PD group showed significant reductions in the total distance, average speed, and central time, as measured by the open field test, while results from the Tatarod test passive motor function scores exhibited significant reductions in both the total distance and latent period (Additional file 1: Fig. S3a, b). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is a rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis, whose expression is proportional to the number of dopaminergic neurons. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect changes in TH+ cells within the SN of mice; TH+ staining was significantly reduced in the PD group compared to the sham group (Additional file 1: Fig. S3c). The DA reuptake inhibitor, 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)-(N-11C-methyl) tropane (CFT), which is based on the phenyltolane structure, and 11C-CFT have a high affinity with presynaptic membrane dopamine transporter (DAT), reflecting the function of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia striatum pathway. CFT-PET brain imaging was used to observe the distribution of DAT in different regions of the brain, revealing a significantly reduced distribution of DAT in the bilateral SN striatum and hippocampus regions of the PD group, indicating impaired dopaminergic neuron function (Additional file 1: Fig. S3d). The proposition of a neuroimmune microenvironment is put forward to explain the onset and progression of PD. Western blotting analysis was performed to detect proteins in the SN, including α-Syn, proinflammatory cytokines [major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) and IL-1β], anti-inflammatory cytokines (CD206), and T cell phenotypes (CD8+ and CD4+). The findings revealed significant upregulation of α-Syn, MHC-II, IL-1β, CD8+, and CD4+ in the PD group, while CD206 exhibited remarkable downregulation (Additional file 1: Fig. S3e).",
        "Open field and Tatarod tests were used to evaluate the neurologic function of the experimental groups. The results indicated a significant reduction in total distance, average speed, central time and escape latency in the PD + PBS group compared to the sham group. As compared to the PD + nOM-MSCs group, the PD + hOM-MSCs group and Pre + hOM-MSCs group showed the most substantial improvement in neural function (Fig. 2a, b). Therefore, transplantation of OM-MSCs enhanced neural function, whereas prevention and treatment with hOM-MSCs significantly improved neural function in a mouse model of PD.Fig. 2The hOM-MSCs facilitated the recovery of nerve function and the immunomodulation of microglia in the PD mouse model. a The neurologic function score of the open field test shows the activity trace of PD mice (left).

        "The protective effect of hOM-MSCs on dopaminergic neurons in the SN of PD mice was assessed by immunohistochemistry and slide scanning to determine the loss of TH+ cells. The PD + PBS group showed a significant reduction in TH+ cells compared to the sham group, while treatment with nOM-MSCs increased TH+ cells. Notably, PD + hOM-MSCs and Pre + hOM-MSCs groups exhibited the most significant increase in TH+ cells. Meanwhile, immunostaining with Iba1, a marker for microglial activation, revealed a significant increase in the number of Iba1+ cells and pseudopodia in the PD + PBS group compared to the sham group. Furthermore, the number of Iba1+ cells decreased and cell morphology recovered in the PD + nOM-MSCs group. The PD + hOM-MSCs and Pre + hOM-MSCs groups also showed a significant decrease in the number of Iba1+ cells and a notable recovery of cell morphology (Fig. 2a, c). CFT-PET brain imaging was utilized to observe the distribution of DAT in brain tissue. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the distribution of DAT within the SN, striatum, and hippocampus of the PD + PBS group compared to the sham group. Conversely, treatment with nOM-MSCs resulted in an increase in DAT distribution, while hOM-MSC treatment led to a significant increase as well (Fig. 2d). The distribution of activated microglia mitochondrial outer membrane transporter protein (TSPO) in brain tissue was demonstrated using [18F]F-DPA-PET brain imaging. TSPO distribution within the brain tissue was elevated in PD + PBS group compared to the sham group. However, treatment with nOM-MSCs resulted in reduced TSPO levels, while hOM-MSCs treatment exhibited significant reduction (Fig. 2d). The protein expression levels of BAX, Bcl-2, and caspase 3 were examined using Western blotting analysis on SN nerve cells. The results indicated that BAX and caspase 3 expression significantly increased whereas Bcl-2 expression decreased significantly when comparing PD model mice with control mice. Treatment with nOM-MSCs resulted in decreased levels of BAX and caspase 3 expression along with increased levels of Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, both PD + hOM-MSCs and Pre + hOM-MSCs groups exhibited significantly reduced levels of BAX and caspase 3 expression along with elevated levels of Bcl-2 expression as well (Additional file 1: Fig. S4a). Additionally, the concentrations of DA and its metabolite HVA secreted by dopaminergic neurons in the SN were measured. ELISA results revealed a significant decrease in both DA and HVA concentrations in the PD + PBS group compared to the sham group. However, PD + nOM-MSCs group resulted in increased levels of both DA and HVA. Furthermore, both PD + hOM-MSCs and Pre + hOM-MSCs groups exhibited a significant elevation in DA and HVA concentrations (Additional file 1: Fig. S4b).",
        "The flow cytometry analysis of JC-1 and ROS was conducted to serve as indicators of mitochondrial function, while alterations in mitochondrial ultrastructure were examined using TEM. The flow cytometry analysis revealed a significant decrease in JC-1 levels and an increase in ROS production in the PD + PBS group compared to the sham group. Conversely, treatment with nOM-MSCs resulted in increased JC-1 levels and decreased ROS production. The most pronounced increase in JC-1 levels and decrease in ROS production were observed in the PD + hOM-MSCs and Pre + hOM-MSCs groups (Additional file 1: Fig. S4c). TEM analysis demonstrated that the mitochondria from the PD + PBS group exhibited significant swelling and disorganization compared to those from the sham group. While nOM-MSCs improved mitochondrial morphology, hOM-MSCs showed the most remarkable recovery of mitochondrial structure (Fig. 2e). Thus, OM-MSCs exert a protective effect on neuronal mitochondrial function, with hOM-MSCs significantly enhancing this protective function.",
        "Western blotting was employed to detect differences in levels of α-Syn, IL-1β, and CD206 protein expression. The findings revealed a significant elevation in α-Syn and IL-1β, as well as a notable reduction in CD206 within the PD + PBS group compared to the sham group. Conversely, following nOM-MSCs treatment, a decrease was observed in both α-Syn and IL-1β levels while CD206 levels increased. Furthermore, both α-Syn and IL-1β experienced a substantial decline alongside a significant increase in CD206 within the PD + hOM-MSCs and Pre + hOM-MSCs groups (Additional file 1: Fig. S4d). Therefore, the transplantation of hOM-MSCs significantly enhances the clearance of α-Syn and promotes the transformation to the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype of microglia in PD mouse models. The protein expression levels of p50, p65, CD4+, and CD8+ in SN were evaluated using Western blotting. Notably, the PD + PBS group exhibited significant upregulation of p50, p65, CD4+, and CD8+ compared to the sham group. In contrast, the PD + nOM-MSCs group displayed a decrease in their expression levels, while both the PD + hOM-MSCs and Pre + hOM-MSCs groups demonstrated a substantial downregulation (Additional file 1: Fig. S4e). Thus, hOM-MSC transplantation effectively suppressed the inflammatory response and T-cell infiltration in the SN of the PD mouse model.",
        "The immunomodulatory and neuroprotective mechanisms of hOM-MSCs in a PD cell model were determined using ATAC-seq combined with ISO-seq. Differences in the newly opened chromatin regions, corresponding transcripts, and related gene expression of hOM-MSCs were detected. The co-expression patterns of differentially regulated genes in ATAC-seq and ISO-seq datasets, both before and after hypoxic pretreatment of OM-MSCs, are visually depicted using a clustering heatmap to illustrate the concurrent changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression levels (Fig. 3a-c). DeepTools, Boxplot, and Venn diagram were employed to visualize an ATAC-seq read enrichment heatmap for differential peaks, evaluate the heterogeneity of gene expression levels within a single sample, and depict co-occurring genes or specific changes in expression levels (Additional file 1: Fig. S5a-c). The annotation results of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were categorized based on KEGG pathway types. Among them, the two signaling pathways that exhibited the most significant enrichment were cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3d). The DEGs of selected cytokine subclasses underwent hierarchical cluster analysis, and network interaction diagrams were elegantly crafted to showcase the 20 signaling pathways alongside their corresponding genes in the visually captivating KEGG enrichment bubble map. TGF-β1 exhibited correlation with 15 signaling pathways, CXCL12 correlated with 5 signaling pathways, CXCL2 correlated with 3 signaling pathways, while the other two genes (NECTIN2 and TNFRSF6B) only correlated with 1 signaling pathway. CXCL12 and CXCL2 were mainly involved in regulating cell chemotaxis, and TGF-β1 had an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory role besides promoting cell differentiation (Fig. 3e). We hypothesized that hOM-MSCs secrete TGF-β1, a pivotal cytokine with immunomodulatory effects. Integrative genomics viewer (IGV) is a high-performance visualization tool for the interactive exploration of large, comprehensive genomic datasets that support various types of data. Both latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1) and TGF-β1 were visualized by IGV using ATAC-seq combined with ISO-seq. The open chromatin region of LTBP1 in hOM-MSCs was located on chromatin 2, spanning from initiation site 33,288,817 to termination site 33,289,228, while the open chromatin region of TGF-β1 was found on chromatin 19, ranging from initiation site 44,259,010 to termination site 44,261,989. Furthermore, transcription coverage analysis revealed significantly increased expression levels of both LTBP1 and TGF-β1 in the hypoxia group (Fig. 3f). RT-qPCR quantification demonstrated a significant upregulation of LTBP1 and TGF-β1 mRNA levels in OM-MSCs under hypoxic conditions compared to the normoxia group (Fig. 3g). Western blotting analysis confirmed elevated protein expression levels of TGF-β1 in OM-MSCs within the hypoxia group when compared to the normoxia control (Fig. 3g). ELISA assessment before and after hypoxia pretreatment showed a substantial increase in the concentration of secreted TGF-β1 both intracellularly and extracellularly within the hypoxia group in contrast to the normoxia group; notably higher concentrations were observed in supernatant samples (Fig. 3h).Fig. 3ATAC-seq combined with ISO-seq to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of hOM-MSCs in PD cell model. a Enrichment heatmap of ATAC-seq differential peak before and after hypoxic pretreatment of OM-MSCs.

        "Furthermore, ISO-seq was performed on microglial cells derived from a PD cell model with the intervention of OM-MSCs. The control 1, control 2, and control 3 groups served as the control models. Normoxia 1, normoxia 2, and normoxia 3 underwent nOM-MSC intervention. Hypoxia 1, hypoxia 2, and hypoxia 3 received hOM-MSC intervention. The selected DEGs were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis, and those with similar or identical expression patterns were visualized in clustering heat maps (Fig. 3i). Based on the KEGG pathway classification, the significantly enriched DEGs and transcripts between the model group and hOM-MSC intervention group were analyzed, and found that the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt) signaling pathway was the most significant enrichment (Fig. 3j). In addition to identifying 4 highly enriched pathways along with their corresponding genes in the KEGG enrichment bubble map, our analysis revealed that there were 23 differentially enriched genes in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, 10 differentially enriched genes in the Rap1 signaling pathway, 4 differentially enriched genes in the endocytosis pathway, and only 2 distinctively enriched genes demonstrated in the cAMP signaling pathway (Fig. 3k). Hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on the DEGs between the model and nOM-MSC intervention groups. Furthermore, KEGG pathway annotation revealed significant enrichment of DEGs between the two groups based on their respective pathways; however, no observed enrichment was found for the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (Additional file 1: Fig. S5d). Hierarchical cluster analysis was also performed on the DEGs between the nOM-MSC and hOM-MSC groups while conducting a significant enrichment analysis based on KEGG pathway types for both DEGs and transcript annotations; revealing a higher level of enrichment for DEGs within the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (Additional file 1: Fig. S5e). Thus, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is hypothesized to play a pivotal role in regulating microglial function.",
        "To elucidate the immunomodulatory and neuroprotective mechanisms of hOM-MSCs in a mouse model of PD, scRNA-seq was used to identify gene expression profiles in SN tissue obtained from the transplantation of hOM-MSCs in the PD mouse model. Utilizing the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm allowed us to visualize different cell types across all groups within a two-dimensional space, including microglia cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells (ECs), mononuclear phagocytes (MPs), neuroblasts, mural cells, choroid plexus cells, T cells, B cells, ependymal cells, erythrocytes, and neutrophils (Fig. 4a). To identify DEGs, the genes that were expressed in more than 10% of the cells within a cluster were selected with an average log (fold change) > 0.25 as DEGs (Additional file 1: Fig. S5f). The microglia cells, which constitute the predominant population and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of neuroinflammatory responses in PD. M1 markers (Cd86, Ccl5, Cxcl10, and Tnf) and M2 markers (Il4, Il10, Cd163, and Arg1) were compared in nOM-MSC treatment, hOM-MSC treatment and prevention. The microglia in the hOM-MSC and Pre-hOM-MSC groups showed a stronger inclination towards M2 transformation compared to the nOM-MSC treatment group (Fig. 4b; Additional file 1: Fig. S5g). Furthermore, we conducted a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to compare and analyze the microglial gene sets between the hOM-MSC and Pre-hOM-MSC groups and the nOM-MSC group. An enrichment bubble map identified two significantly enriched pathways with their corresponding genes (Fig. 4c; Additional file 1: Fig. S5h). Gene network analysis revealed significant enrichment and interaction of PI3K-Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in microglia (Fig. 4d; Additional file 1: Fig. S5i). Line plots of enrichment scores demonstrated upregulation of the PI3K-Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in microglia when comparing the hOM-MSC and Pre-hOM-MSC groups with the nOM-MSC group (Fig. 4e; Additional file 1: Fig. S5j). Therefore, based on our further analysis, the PI3K-Akt/mTOR signaling pathway has a pivotal role in microglia during hOM-MSC treatment and prevention in the PD mouse model. Therefore, based on our further analysis, the PI3K-Akt/mTOR signaling pathway has a pivotal role in microglia during hOM-MSC treatment and prevention in the PD mouse model.Fig. 4scRNA-seq to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of hOM-MSCs in PD mice model. a UMAP of integrated transcriptomes in all groups samples of SN showing cell-type assignment, including microglia cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, ECs, MPs, neuroblasts, mural cells, choroid plexus cells, T cells, B cells, ependymal cells, erythrocytes, and neutrophils. b Heatmap showing microglial M1 markers and M2 markers between nOM-MSCs treatment and hOM-MSCs treatment in the SN of PD mice. c GSEA showing the two significantly enriched pathways and the corresponding genes in the enrichment bubble map. d Gene network analysis revealed significant enrichment and interaction of PI3K-Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in microglia. e Line plots of enrichment score showed upregulation of PI3K-Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in microglia. f UMAP of integrated transcriptomes in all groups of microglia showing cell-type assignment, and ultimately segregated the microglia into seven distinct subgroups. g Dotplot showing the genes expressed in > 10% of microglia in a cluster as DEGs. h KEGG pathway dotplot showing the enrichment and up-regulation signaling pathway in microglial cells_2 and _4 in the SN of PD mice after hOM-MSCs treatment. i The cell types net graph shows the interactions between various cell populations and pinpointed the interaction between microglia and MPs as the most significant. j UMAP of integrated transcriptomes in all groups of MPs showing cell-type assignment, including macrophages, non-classic and classic mononuclear cells, cDC1, and cDC2. k Heatmap showing the cell–cell interaction analysis based on known receptor-ligand interactions between all subtypes of microglia and MPs in the SN of PD mice after hOM-MSCs treatment. l Dot graph showing the cell–cell interaction differences among the three pairs of receptor-ligands were the most significant.

        "After painstakingly categorizing the microglia cells into detailed subtypes, they were further segregated into 7 distinct subgroups. And then selected the genes expressed in more than 10% of cells in a cluster as DEGs (Fig. 4f, g). Enrichment analysis of KEGG was conducted on microglia subsets across different groups. Comparing the PD + hOM-MSCs and Pre-hOM-MSCs groups with the PD + PBS group, significant enrichment in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was observed for microglial cells_2 and _4 (Fig. 4h; Additional file 1: Fig. S5k). The interaction between microglia and MPs was particularly noteworthy among the various cell populations investigated (Fig. 4i). Using the UMAP algorithm to visualize the captured cell subtype of MPs in all groups within a two-dimensional space, including macrophages, non-classic and classic mononuclear cells, cDC1, and cDC2 (Fig. 4j). The cell–cell interaction analysis was performed based on known receptor-ligand interactions between all subtypes of microglia and MPs. Our analysis revealed that the PD + hOM-MSCs and Pre-hOM-MSCs groups exhibited significantly enhanced cell–cell interactions between microglial cells_4 and all other cell subtypes compared to the PD + PBS group (Fig. 4k; Additional file 1: Fig. S5l). The differences in cell–cell interactions among three pairs of receptor-ligands were found to be most significant when comparing PD + hOM-MSCs group with the PD + PBS group, including protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C (PTPRC) (classic mononuclear cells)-CD22 (microglial cells_4), CD28 (macrophages)-CD86 (microglia) and CD74 (microglial cells_4)-macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (MPs) (Fig. 4l). The same approach analysis was performed to compare the Pre-hOM-MSCs group with the PD + PBS group. Notably, significant differences were observed among the three pairs of receptor-ligands, including IL1B (MPs)-adrenoceptor beta 2 (ADRB2) (microglia), G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) (MPs)-prosaposin (PSAP) (microglial cells_4) and CD74 (MPs)-MIF (microglia) (Additional file 1: Fig. S5m). Therefore, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway plays a crucial role in microglial cells_2 and _4 during hOM-MSC treatment and prevention in the PD mouse model. Moreover, interactions between PTPRC-CD22, CD28-CD86, CD74-MIF, IL1B-ADRB2, and GPR37-PSAP receptor-ligand may significantly impact the regulation of immunity and phagocytosis in microglial cells. The same approach analysis was performed between the Pre-hOM-MSC group and PD + PBS group.",
        "After conducting high-throughput sequencing analysis, the differential gene enrichment in the PI3K-Akt pathway diagram of microglia cells was compared subsequent to hOM-MSC intervention. Our findings suggested that growth factor located extracellularly activates the PI3K-Akt signaling pathways by binding to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK; Additional file 1: Fig. S6a). Furthermore, TGF-β1 is a protein factor present in growth factors, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is an RTK belonging to the type I receptor of TGF-β1. Based on the aforementioned analysis, we propose that hOM-MSC-secreted TGF-β1 may modulate immune responses by activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway through binding to microglial cell membrane receptors expressing ALK.",
        "The lentiviral vectors were employed to generate shRNA specifically targeting TGF-β1 mRNA in hOM-MSCs, while siRNA against the cell surface receptor, ALK, was utilized in BV2 microglial cells. The Western blotting results demonstrated the remarkable efficacy of the two mRNA interference reagents constructed, which can be employed for subsequent functional verification experiments (Fig. 5a). The neuroprotective effect of hOM-MSCs mediated by TGF-β1 on neurons in PD cell models was investigated, along with the ability of microglia to regulate immune responses and clear α-Syn. Through dual staining of the neuronal marker NeuN and the apoptotic marker BAX, an increase in apoptotic cells was observed in the hOM-MSCs + shRNA TGF-β1 group compared to the hOM-MSCs group. Conversely, a significant decrease in apoptotic cells was noted in the TGF-β1 group, while a notable increase in apoptotic cells was observed in the TGF-β1 + siRNA ALK group (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, Western blotting analysis of BAX protein expression provided additional evidence supporting the protective effect of hOM-MSCs mediated by TGF-β1 on neurons in PD cell models (Fig. 5c, d). The levels of α-Syn, M1 marker (IL-1β), M2 marker (CD206), and autophagy-related LC3B expression were further assessed in microglia from each group. Western blotting analysis revealed that the hOM-MSCs + shRNA TGF-β1 group exhibited upregulated expression of α-Syn, IL-1β, and LC3B protein compared to the hOM-MSCs group, while CD206 protein expression was significantly downregulated. Conversely, the TGF-β1 group showed decreased expression of α-Syn, IL-1β, and LC3B, but increased CD206 expression. The levels of α-Syn, IL-1β, and LC3B were significantly upregulated in the TGF-β1 + siRNA ALK group, whereas CD206 expression was markedly downregulated (Fig. 5c, d). To assess the regulatory impact of TGF-β1-mediated hOM-MSCs on inflammatory factors in the PD cell model, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) were assessed in the cell supernatant of each experimental group. ELISA results revealed that compared to the hOM-MSCs group, there was a significant increase in concentrations of IL-1β and TNF-α in the supernatant of the hOM-MSCs + shRNA TGF-β1 group, while concentrations of IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly reduced. Furthermore, there was a notable decrease in levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in the supernatants of the TGF-β1 group, accompanied by a significant elevation in concentrations of IL-4 and IL-10. The concentrations of IL-1β and TNF-α were markedly increased in the TGF-β1 + siRNA ALK group, whereas levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were substantially decreased (Additional file 1: Fig. S6b). Therefore, TGF-β1 mediates the ability of hOM-MSCs to regulate the immunophenotype, autophagy, and clearance of α-Syn in microglia. Furthermore, the administration of human recombinant protein TGF-β1 alone is also capable of fulfilling these functions.Fig. 5TGF-β1 mediates hOM-MSC to enhance neuroprotective function by activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in microglia in vitro.\na Western blotting measuring TGF-β1 protein expression in hOM-MSCs, and ALK protein expression in BV2 cells. b Exemplary immunofluorescence micrograph showing nuclei (DAPI), NeuN, and BAX expression in SH-SY5Y cells (Scale bars = 40 μm). c Western blotting measuring BAX protein expression in SH-SY5Y cells, and α-Syn, IL-1β, CD206, and LC3B protein expression in BV2 cells. d The histogram showing the BAX fluorescence expression in (b), and BAX, α-Syn, IL-1β, CD206, and LC3B protein expression in (c). e, f Western blotting measuring p-PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR, p50, p65, and LC3B protein expression in BV2 cells.

        "Immunologic regulation by hOM-MSCs via activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in microglia cell secretion of TGF-β1 was determined. The phosphorylation status of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the mTOR-mediated regulation of cellular activity and autophagic homeostasis, as well as the levels of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) family member (p50 and p65) and LC3B autophagy-related proteins involved in immune-inflammatory responses, were assessed in the experimental groups. Western blotting results revealed that the α-Syn group exhibited a significant decrease in the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR compared to the control group, while p50, p65, and LC3B were significantly upregulated. Conversely, hOM-MSC intervention led to a significant increase in phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR with concomitant downregulation of p50, p65, and LC3B. In contrast, hOM-MSCs + shRNA TGF-β1 intervention resulted in inhibited phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR, while p50, p65, and LC3B were activated (Fig. 5e). The involvement of human recombinant protein TGF-β1 in immune regulation was investigated in microglial cells by examining its impact on the activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The phosphorylation status of the PI3K-Akt and mTOR signaling pathways, as well as the levels of LC3B, p50, and p65 proteins, were assessed in these experimental groups. Western blotting results revealed that compared to the control group, the α-Syn group exhibited a significant decrease in the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR while showing significant upregulation of p50, p65, and LC3B. Conversely, TGF-β1 intervention led to a significant increase in the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR with concomitant downregulation of p50, p65, and LC3B. In contrast, TGF-β1 + siRNA ALK intervention resulted in inhibited phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR, and activated p50, p65, and LC3B (Fig. 5f). Therefore, the secretion of TGF-β1 by hOM-MSCs further activated the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway through interaction with microglial cell membrane ALK receptors, thereby regulating the immune response and maintaining homeostasis of autophagy.",
        "The ability of hOM-MSC transplantation to secrete TGF-β1 and activate the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by binding with ALK-expressing microglial cell membrane receptors was further confirmed, thereby exerting regulatory immune response and neuroprotective functions in PD mouse models. Lentiviral vectors were employed to generate shRNA targeting TGF-β1 mRNA in hOM-MSCs, while AAV was used to produce AAV ALK targeting the microglial cell surface receptor, ALK, in a PD mouse model.",
        "The therapeutic potential of TGF-β1 in a mouse model of PD was investigated by examining its binding to the ALK receptor on microglial cell membranes, followed by modulation of hOM-MSCs. The neurologic function of the experimental groups was evaluated using the open field and Tatarod tests. The findings demonstrated a noteworthy decrease in total distance, average speed, central time, and latency within the PD + hOM-MSCs + shRNA TGF-β1 group compared to the PD + hOM-MSCs group, these aforementioned indices of neurologic function exhibited a significant increase in the PD + TGF-β1 group, whereas there was a marked decrease when comparing the PD + AAV ALK + TGF-β1 group with the PD + TGF-β1 group (Fig. 6a, b). After immunohistochemical staining with the dopaminergic neuron marker, TH, slide scanning was performed to observe the loss of TH+ cells in the SN. The findings revealed a significant decrease in the proportion of TH+ cell loss in the PD + hOM-MSCs + shRNA TGF-β1 group compared to the PD + hOM-MSCs group. Treatment with TGF-β1 substantially mitigated this proportion, while administration of AAV ALK + TGF-β1 also resulted in a decrease (Fig. 6a, c). After immunohistochemical staining with the microglia activation marker, Iba1, slide scanning was performed to observe the loss of Iba1+ cells in the hippocampus. The results demonstrated a significant increase in the proportion of Iba1+ cells in the PD + hOM-MSCs + shRNA TGF-β1 group compared to the PD + hOM-MSCs group. Treatment with TGF-β1 significantly reduced the proportion of Iba1+ cells, and treatment with AAV ALK + TGF-β1 also showed an increase in this proportion (Fig. 6a, c). Immunofluorescence co-localization results demonstrated the precise targeting ability of AAV ALK towards microglial cell membrane receptors in the SN of a PD mouse model (Fig. 6d). The regulatory impact of TGF-β1-mediated hOM-MSCs on inflammatory factors in the SN of the PD mouse model was evaluated by assessing the levels of both proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in the SN tissues from each experimental group. The ELISA results unveiled a significant elevation in the concentrations of IL-1β and TNF-α within the PD + hOM-MSCs + shRNA TGF-β1 group compared to PD + hOM-MSCs group. Conversely, there was a marked reduction in IL-4 and IL-10 levels. Furthermore, TGF-β1 treatment resulted in a noteworthy decrease in IL-1β and TNF-α levels, while significantly elevating the concentrations of IL-4 and IL-10. On the other hand, administration of AAV ALK along with TGF-β1 led to an augmentation in both IL-1β and TNF-a levels, accompanied by a substantial reduction in the concentrations of IL-4 and IL-10 (Additional file 1: Fig. S6c). Therefore, TGF-β1 mediates the modulatory effects of hOM-MSCs on microglia immunophenotype, and human recombinant protein TGF-β1 alone is also capable of fulfilling these roles.Fig. 6TGF-β1 mediates hOM-MSC to facilitate the recovery of nerve function by activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in microglia in vivo. a The neurologic function score of open field test showing the activity trace of PD mice (left).

The Schwab and England daily activity scale showed recovery from 50 to 70%. The 6-month follow-up results post-surgery showed a UPDRS total score of 80, a Hoehn and Yahr rating scale at level 3, and a Schwab and England daily activity scale at 50% (Additional file 2: Table S4). Case 3 demonstrated excellent tolerance to the procedure with no severe adverse events reported during the post-procedure period.",
        "The fourth participant in the study was a 71-year-old male (case 4) who was afflicted with PD for 4 years. After implantation of hOM-MSCs, there was a significant reduction in the oral maintenance dose of levodopa from 1.5 g/d before surgery to 0.25 g/d. The patient exhibited improvements in mood, activities of daily living, motor tests, and treatment complications (Additional file 6: Video S4).

        "Finally, the fifth participant in the cohort was a 62-year-old female (case 5) who was diagnosed with PD for 13 years.

        "The Western blotting results revealed an upregulation in the protein expressions of TGF-β1 and CD206, while IL-1β was downregulated at 5 and 11 d post cell transplantation. These changes exhibited a time-dependent gradient (Fig. 8b). The ELISA results revealed a significant elevation in dopamine (DA) levels, as well as the presence of anti-inflammatory factors TGF-β1, IL-4, and IL-10 following cell therapy when compared to pre-transplantation levels at 5 and 11 d post-cell transplantation. Moreover, there was a notable reduction in the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α at 5 and 11 d post-cell transplantation. Both changes also exhibited a time-dependent gradient (Fig. 8c, d, Additional file 1: Fig. S7a, b). In general, the neurological function of 5 patients with PD was effectively improved following treatment with hOM-MSCs without any serious adverse events during the post-procedure period.",
        "The pathologic mechanism underlying PD development needs to be further elucidated. The main pathologic marker of PD is α-Syn. Under normal physiologic conditions, there exists a dynamic equilibrium between the production and degradation of α-Syn. However, this balance is disrupted by various genetically or environmentally controlled pathologic factors, leading to misfolding of α-Syn [26]. In addition to the abnormal accumulation in the brain, α-Syn can also be transmitted to the brain via the vagus nerve from its abnormal accumulation starting in the gut [27]. During disease progression, α-Syn spreads to different regions of the brain in a prion-like manner [28]. Microglia are the first immune defense system of the human brain and one of the main cell types involved in the inflammatory response in the CNS [29]. Microglia can recognize misfolded α-Syn through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 on the cell surface, which subsequently initiates related signaling pathways. This process includes activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines expression, ultimately promoting a shift from an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype to a proinflammatory M1 phenotype [30, 31]. Under pathologic conditions associated with PD, activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in microglia promotes the secretion of inflammatory chemokines, such as RANTES and eotaxin. This leads to increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the SN region of the brain affected by PD and enhances cytotoxicity against dopaminergic neurons [32, 33]. Additionally, α-Syn can be internalized by microglia and acts as an antigen-presenting cell, which subsequently presents antigens to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, triggering the activation and autoimmune response through multiple pathways that ultimately result in the apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons [11]. The regulation of microglia by T cells infiltrating the brain of PD patients is also an important aspect of pathogenesis. During the initial stage of the disease, the compromised blood–brain barrier permits the infiltration of T lymphocytes, including T regulatory cells (Tregs), into the brain. As the disease progresses, there is homeostatic dysregulation of Tregs and T effector cells (Teffs), leading to Teff-mediated activation via the secretion of diverse proinflammatory factors that upregulate MHC-II expression in microglia [34, 35]. Furthermore, heightened activation of microglia amplifies the impact on T cells, thereby engendering a deleterious feedback loop that expedites mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons [35]. Therefore, we propose the concept of a neuroimmune microenvironment in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. The key components that constitute the neuroimmune microenvironment of PD include persistent inflammatory response, activated microglia, an imbalance between Teffs and Tregs, as well as degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which collectively contribute to the onset and progression of PD [36].",
        "PD exerts psychological, physical, economic, and social effects on individuals with PD, as well as their families and society at large. Currently, there are no treatments available to cure PD or alter its progression of PD. As such, approaches for treating and preventing PD are urgently needed. Recently, the transplantation of MSCs has been effective in treating neurodegenerative diseases [37]. The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is caused by the interaction of α-Syn, microglia, and T cells during PD [36]. As a result, if one or more of these links can be targeted to slow down disease progression, it will be a crucial strategy for PD prevention and treatment. In summary, the use of MSCs can accelerate the clearance and degradation of α-Syn via multitarget disease-modifying mechanisms, such as modulating microglia activation, enhancing the autophagy process, mediating endocytosis, protease secretion, and preventing pyroptosis of microglia [24, 37–40]. As cell-based therapy candidates for PD treatment, MSCs offer a broader scope beyond simple cell replacement due to their ability to detoxify ROS, as well as supply neurotrophic factors via paracrine effects that protect the mitochondrial function of dopaminergic neurons [24, 36]. Based on progress in understanding the MSC multitarget disease-modifying effect, we believe that MSCs could serve as an important therapeutic strategy or preventive measure against the onset of PD in high-risk individuals while also slowing down its progression.",
        "Numerous studies have demonstrated the positive effects of stem cells, such as umbilical cord MSCs, bone marrow-derived MSCs, adipose-derived MSCs, or embryonic stem cells in PD treatment, which could improve neurologic function via diverse immunologic and histologic measures [41–44]. Nevertheless, these cells face several limitations that hinder their clinical application, including ethical issues, low yield rates, and immune rejection. To obtain more ideal nerve repair cells, our team successfully cultured OM-MSCs and established a comprehensive culture system. These cells exhibit a higher rate of proliferation and shorter passage time. Moreover, OM-MSCs are widely distributed in the nasal cavity with easy accessibility. They do not elicit immune rejection, nor pose significant ethical issues. Additionally, they retain biological activity that remains unchanged with age [23, 45]. As previously stated, the nasal mucosa originates from embryonic ectoderm and can directly differentiate into neurons under the right conditions. According to chromosome karyotype and tumor gene analyses, there is no genetic variation after extensive in vitro passages [46]. Our findings confirmed that OM-MSCs possess multi-lineage differentiation potential including neurons, bone tissue, and adipose tissue [23, 47]. Thus, the benefits of OM-MSCs make them an ideal source of cells for treating neuroimmune diseases like PD.",
        "Selecting and confirming better experimental models was an important part of this study. The prefabricated fiber body-activated α-Syn, microglia cells (BV2), and neurons (SH-SY5Y) were used to construct the neurocellular immune model of PD, and simulate certain pathological processes of PD [24]. A chronic mouse model of PD was established by combining MPTP with probenecid [25]. Previous studies have shown that microglia cells in the SN of the MPTP chronic mouse model become activated, leading to a neuroinflammatory response [48, 49]. Therefore, MPTP combined with probenecid was selected in this study to construct a chronic PD model to mimic specific aspects of the neuroimmune model of PD. In this study, OM-MSCs were first amplified and cultured in vitro, and the 5th generation cells were chosen for identification, which showed the purity of the OM-MSCs exceeding 97%. After a 24-h co-culture with the PD cell model, it was observed that OM-MSCs have mitochondrial protective properties capable of promoting the transition from an M1-proinflammatory phenotype to an M2-antiinflammatory phenotype microglia cells while inhibiting the excessive autophagy reactions. These effects were significantly improved after hypoxic pretreatment. Subsequently, the OM-MSCs were transplanted into PD chronic mouse models via stereotactic lateral ventricles injection. Neural function scores indicated that hOM-MSCs substantially improved neurologic function in mice; moreover, hOM-MSC treatment resulted in less neurological damage when administered preventatively. Furthermore, hOM-MSCs significantly increased the immune and autophagy regulation of microglial cells in the PD model and protected the function of neuronal mitochondria.",
        "The research focus of MSCs has shifted from cell replacement to multitarget therapy, such as paracrine and immune regulation. The generation of multifunctional factors by MSCs is a critical factor in their ability to modify the function of host cells. Studies have shown that the paracrine activity of cytokines secreted by MSCs effectively recovers and rescues the damage to neurologic function [24, 36]. However, it remains unclear which core functional factors secreted from hOM-MSCs play important roles in the hOM-MSC-modulated recovery of neurologic function. To further explore the underlying mechanism, the ATAC-seq technique combined with Iso-seq was employed to investigate the disparities in newly accessible chromatin regions and their corresponding transcripts, as well as the associated gene expression levels of OM-MSCs prior to and following hypoxia pretreatment. Bioinformatics analysis revealed significant upregulation in chromatin opening and transcription levels of LTBP1 in hOM-MSCs, along with a significant upregulation in TGF-β1 gene expression directly regulated by LTBP1. ISO-seq was performed on microglial cells derived from a PD cell model with the intervention from OM-MSCs. Based on the KEGG pathway classification, the significantly enriched results of DEGs and transcripts between the model and hOM-MSC intervention groups were analyzed, demonstrating that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched. Furthermore, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective mechanisms of hOM-MSCs were elucidated using a mouse model for PD treatment. scRNA-seq was employed to identify gene expression profiles in SN tissue following transplantation with hOM-MSCs for treatment and prevention purposes within the PD mouse model. Further analysis suggested that the PI3K-Akt/mTOR signaling pathway has a pivotal role in microglia during hOM-MSC treatment and prevention in a PD mouse model. Moreover, interactions between PTPRC-CD22, CD28-CD86, CD74-MIF, IL1B-ADRB2, and GPR37-PSAP receptors significantly impact the regulation of immunity and phagocytosis in microglial cells.",
        "TGF-β1, a platelet-derived substance in the early 1980s, promotes the virus-like transformation and proliferation of tissue cells. Composing 391 amino acids, TGF-β1 is a precursor protein molecule that includes an active TGF-β1 molecule, signal peptide, and inactive associated peptide (LAP) [50]. Following secretion, TGF-β1 binds to LAP either covalently or non-covalently to form small precursor complexes devoid of activity. Subsequently, this complex is linked to LTBP1 via disulfide bonds to generate a large precursor complex that releases active TGF-β1 through integrin-mediated tension during cell contraction [51–53]. As a crucial cytokine for both innate and adaptive immunity, TGF-β1 plays roles in promoting neurogenesis, and gliosis, and regulating neural patterns, myelin and microglia development during brain maturation [51, 53]. It is worth noting that TGF-β1 is indispensable for microglia development and cell homeostasis. In the absence of TGF-β1, the tmem119 and p2ry12 genes responsible for maintaining homeostasis in microglia are downregulated, while the Axl and APOE genes associated with damage are upregulated [54]. Microglia cells serve as vital immune defense cells in the brain and play key roles in the neuroinflammatory response of the CNS, suggesting significant potential of TGF-β1 in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. The TGF-β1 type I receptor, ALK, belongs to the RTK family, which mainly mediates cell signaling [55]. Upon activation, RTK forms dimers by binding to similar nearby kinases, and phosphorylation occurs at specific sites within the dimer. This phosphorylation event triggers the activation of ALK, enabling it to transfer phosphate groups to downstream proteins in the intracellular signaling pathway and ultimately leading to protein activation [55, 56].",
        "The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway can be activated by various types of cytokine stimulation, thereby regulating fundamental cellular processes such as intracellular transcription, translation, proliferation, growth, and survival [57]. The binding of growth factors to their receptors (RTK or G-protein-coupled receptors) stimulates the activation of class Ia and Ib PI3K subtypes, respectively. Activation of PI3K produces phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate on the cell membrane, which in turn acts as a second messenger of downstream Akt activation [58]. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway also plays an important role in the CNS, and its activation exhibits neuroprotective effects [59]. Studies have demonstrated that the MPTP-induced PD model significantly reduces the level of intracellular Akt phosphorylation, thus leading to apoptosis and loss of dopaminergic neurons [57, 59]. Furthermore, activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway can downregulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines in microglia by regulating the NF-κB pathway [59].",
        "The NF-κB protein is widely distributed throughout the nervous system and plays a pivotal role in regulating inflammatory response. It is highly expressed in striatal neurons of patients with PD [60]. The NF-κB protein family exists as homodimers or heterodimers, with p50/p65 being the most prevalent form [61]. In the progression of PD, damaged neurons release a large number of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. These cytokines activate the NF-κB pathway in microglia cells, leading to neuroinflammation and extensive neuronal damage [60, 62]. Studies have shown that the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway alleviates the neuroinflammatory response and neuronal damage induced by MPTP in PD [60, 62]. Furthermore, activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway controls the transcription and expression of inflammatory chemokines like RANTES and eotaxin in various cell types. Studies have confirmed the activation of NF-κB in microglia cells of PD patients and the MPTP model in mice and monkeys, and have investigated the role of NF-κB in the adaptive immune response o in the nigra [63–65]. It can be concluded that under PD pathologic conditions, activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in microglia promotes the secretion of inflammatory chemokines, such as RANTES and eotaxin, thus increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the SN of PD and enhancing the cytotoxic response to dopaminergic neurons [33]. This study confirmed that TGF-β1 secreted by hOM-MSCs downregulates the NF-κB pathway by activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in microglia cells, thereby playing a role in immune regulation.",
        "The mTOR is a crucial regulator of autophagy in mammals [66]. The PI3k-Akt pathway serves as the upstream regulatory pathway for mTOR, which gets activated by the receptors of neuro-nutrients and growth factors. This activation promotes cell growth, differentiation, and survival while suppressing cell apoptosis and other signals. Therefore, activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway facilitates the protection of nerve cells and inhibits excessive autophagy through mTOR activation [67]. Moreover, this pathway plays an important regulatory role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like PD and is essential for synaptic activity and normal function [68]. The interaction between the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and the autophagy process, however, is very complex and presents a potential modulator function for autophagy. Therefore, the ideal protein factor or compound for improving PD should have the function of stimulating or maintaining the normal PI3K-Akt-mTOR survival pathway and regulating autophagy homeostasis of microglia cells. This study also confirmed that TGF-β1 secreted by hOM-MSCs downregulates autophagy-related proteins by activating PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway signals, thus preserving the biological activity of microglia cells.",
        "The present study investigated the impact of clinical-grade hOM-MSCs on neural functional recovery in both PD models and patients, as well as their potential for preventing PD in mouse models. We demonstrated that the core functional factor, TGF-β1, secreted from hOM-MSC plays critical roles in hOM-MSC-modulated recovery of mitochondrial function in dopaminergic neurons by improving microglia immune regulation and autophagy homeostasis in the SN, which are all closely associated with neuroinflammatory responses. Based on scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq combined with ISO-seq analysis, and a functional assay, we found that improvement in the neuroinflammatory response, as well as recovery of neural function upon exposure to hOM-MSCs, are at least partially mediated by TGF-β1 in the SN of PD through the activation of the ALK-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in microglia. Additionally, the study has certain limitations regarding cell survival rate, number of homing cells, and immunomodulatory effects following MSC implantation in vivo; these factors play pivotal roles in determining the success of MSC therapy [36]. Excessive inflammatory response, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and other negative factors present at the site of injury may significantly impede MSC survival and efficacy [23]. Although we conducted hypoxic preconditioning on OM-MSCs to enhance their adaptability to hypoxia and other microenvironments, we did not further investigate the impact of PD nerve immune microenvironment in vivo on the survival rate, duration of survival, and homing capacity after transplantation. Therefore, the subsequent investigation will primarily focus on exploring the interactive regulatory effect and mechanism of MSCs within the neuroimmune microenvironment of PD. This research endeavor will also establish a solid theoretical foundation for developing standardized guidelines pertaining to MSC transplantation using PD animal models.",
        "Furthermore, we have confirmed through a series of neurologic function scores and experiments that intraspinal transplantation of hOM-MSCs can improve the recovery of neurological function and regulate the neuroinflammatory response in PD patients without adverse reactions. It is noteworthy that all patients in the clinical trial exhibited significant improvement in neurological function within 7 d following cell transplantation. Based on the pre- and post-transplantation detection results of CSF and serum, we propose that this period is primarily attributed to the crucial immunomodulatory role played by hOM-MSCs’ paracrine effect. The majority of patients exhibited a certain degree of increase in neurological symptoms and scores at the 6-month follow-up, compared to 1 month after cell transplantation. These aforementioned reasons deserve careful consideration. MSCs have been widely utilized for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory and immune-related diseases owing to their robust immunomodulatory functions. However, the potential effectiveness of MSCs in cell therapy also relies on the activity and functional status. Stem cell senescence is a pivotal factor that significantly affects cellular activity and function, and diminishes the efficacy of cell therapy [69]. The local microenvironment for cell survival plays a crucial role in determining cellular activity and function. Several studies have confirmed that the inflammatory microenvironment is one of the key factors inducing stem cell senescence [70, 71]. PD patients exhibit sustained chronic neuroinflammation in the nigrostriatal region. Even if autologous MSCs are transplanted, they still need to withstand the impact of the inflammatory microenvironment upon entering the brain, which is likely to result in aging and even apoptosis due to continuous exposure to this microenvironment. We believe that the optimal approach to address this issue is currently through a combination of other drugs capable of regulating the inflammatory response or replenishing the number of MSCs within their effective period. We recommend that patients with PD undergo a second round of cell maintenance therapy within 6 – 12 months following their initial treatment. The safety and efficacy of intravenous cell transplantation are currently being investigated, particularly for the elderly population with PD, aiming to alleviate the burden of lumbar puncture. Additionally, strategies to enhance its effectiveness by increasing the number of cell transplantations are also under exploration. Furthermore, it is important to note that this clinical trial had certain limitations due to a small patient cohort and the absence of a randomized control group. Thus, the enrollment of participants in clinical trials involving hOM-MSCs for PD patients will be further expanded, and regular follow-up will be conducted with those who have previously undergone cell transplantation. Finally, although MSC therapy has demonstrated promising results in pre-clinical studies for various diseases, numerous challenges have emerged during clinical trials. Currently, there is a lack of international consensus on the clinical application of MSCs, including optimal cell dosage, administration intervals, culture conditions, and routes of administration. Therefore, further investigation into these factors as well as biological characteristics of MSCs derived from different sources is necessary to identify the most effective treatment strategies for diverse diseases and maximize potential benefits.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to investigate the effects of clinical-grade hOM-MSCs on neural functional recovery in both PD models and patients, as well as their potential preventive effects in mouse models of PD. Collectively, the data demonstrated that the core functional factor TGF-β1 secreted from hOM-MSC plays critical roles in hOM-MSC-modulated recovery of mitochondrial function in dopaminergic neurons by improving microglia immune regulation and autophagy homeostasis in the SN, which are all closely associated with neuroinflammatory responses. Mechanistically, exposure to hOM-MSCs enhances neuroinflammatory response and neural functional recovery partially through TGF-β1-mediated activation of the ALK-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in microglia within the SN of PD patients. Furthermore, intraspinal transplantation of hOM-MSCs is confirmed to improve the recovery of neurologic function and regulate the neuroinflammatory response in PD patients. Hence, we suggest that treatment and prevention using hOM-MSCs could be a promising and effective neuroprotective candidate for PD and other progressive inflammatory-related neurodegenerative diseases. These findings raise the possibility that TGF-β1 may be used alone or combined with hOM-MSCs for PD treatment.",

        "Parkinson’s disease (PD) was first described as ‘shaking palsy’ by Dr. James Parkinson in 1917.1 Since then, numerous scientists have investigated the pathological mechanisms of this common yet incurable neurodegenerative disorder. Despite substantial efforts, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PD remain elusive, with no treatment available yet that can slow down, stop, or reverse its progression.2–5 However, these studies have consistently highlighted that degeneration of a specific cell type, midbrain dopamine neurons (mDANs) in the substantia nigra, is the major pathological feature associated with PD’s characteristic motor deficits, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability.2–5",
        "This observation has led many scientists to explore cell replacement therapy (CRT) as a potential treatment for PD, by replacing the lost mDANs. Starting from the 1980s, various types of dopamine-producing cells have been tested in both pre-clinical and clinical studies, including retinal cells, adrenal medullary cells, carotid body cells, and human and porcine fetal cells.6–13 Among these, a groundbreaking study by Lindvall, Björklund, and their colleagues involved the transplantation of dopamine-rich tissues dissected from fetal ventral mesencephalon (fVM) into a PD patient, resulting in substantial recovery and providing the first “proof-of-concept” for CRT.14 Subsequent open-label studies reported significant and long-term improvements in some patients.15–31 However, fVM-based CRT faced numerous challenges, leading current translational stem cell research to focus on characterizing human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), such as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), as potential sources of transplantable midbrain dopamine (mDA) cells.6–13",
        "Although fVM transplantation revealed serious issues, it provided not only a “proof-of-concept” but also invaluable insights and lessons for the future optimization of CRT. A compelling question arises: Why were the clinical outcomes of previous fVM transplantation highly variable and inefficient? In this review, we will discuss important lessons that can be learned from previous fVM transplantation studies and address critical issues necessary for the success of hPSC-based CRT. Drawing on recent findings from our laboratory and others’, we will highlight host immune responses as major risk factors that limit the survival and maturation of the grafted mDA cells, as well as the overall clinical outcomes of CRT in PD. Additionally, we will explore potential strategic approaches to modify the host immune response and other factors for optimal outcomes in future clinical applications of CRT.",
        "Starting from the late 1980s, stem cell scientists attempted CRT using fVM tissues dissected from aborted embryos (typically 6 to 9 weeks old) because they showed the most promising outcomes among various dopamine-producing cells.6–13 In these early open-label trials using fVM tissues, some patients showed prominent and long-term improvement including enhanced movement, reduced rigidity and tremor; decreased ‘off’ periods; reduction of medication, or in a few cases, a complete cessation; and enhanced dopamine uptake, as evidenced by 18F-DOPA PET scan analyses (Table 1).14–35 Subsequent postmortem studies of deceased transplanted patients further supported these positive clinical outcomes, revealing successful engraftment of implanted mDANs with robust outgrowth and innervation to the host striatum, demonstrating that engrafted mDANs were functionally integrated into neural circuits in the patient’s brain. In summary, these successful clinical data provided the “proof-of-concept” of CRT in PD. Despite these positive results, subsequent double-blind, sham-controlled studies showed clinical benefits were statistically insignificant and this method was not recommended as a treatment for PD.36–38 Furthermore, ∼30% of transplanted patients (18 out of 56) developed a serious side effect: GID,36–38 significantly dampening the initial enthusiasm for the fetal cell-based approach. These inconsistent and disappointing outcomes, along with ethical, medical, and practical limitations, rendered this approach unfeasible as a standard treatment for PD.6–11Table 1List of representative clinical trials using human fetal tissues.Number of patientsAverage age of cohort (range)Disease duration (years)Number of fVM/side (age)Grafted siteImmuno-suppression (period)Follow-up periodTH+ cell survivalOutcomeAdverse effectRef.251.5 (48–55)73–4 (8–10 wks)Unilateral (C+P)CsA, AZA, PSL2 yrsN/AMinor improvement of motor speed for pronation-supinationNone14,24255 (50–60)8–114 (6–7 wks)Unilateral (P)CsA, AZA, PSL (64 mo)10 yrsn = 16246 (rostral);10,728 (middle);25,854 (caudal)Improved rigidity and bradykinesiaNone25,26756.3 (39–66)7–201 (7–8 wks)2 pts-unilateral(C+P);5 pts-bilateral (P)CsA, PSL in 4 pts1–4 yrsN/AMotor improvement; Shorter and less severe dyskinesiaNone18236.5 (30–43)63–4 (6–8 wks)Bilateral (C+P)CsA (12 mo),AZA (18 mo),PSL (N/A)2 yrsN/AImproved motor functionsNone31452 (47–63)10–211 (7–11 wks)Unilateral (C)CsA (6 mo)1.5 yrsN/AImproved motor functions (3/4)Transient panic disorder (1/4)29256 (49–63)10–172–3 (6–9 wks)1 pt–unilateral (P);1 pt–bilateral (C+P)CsA (7 mo), AZA, PSL1.5 yrsN/AImproved motor functionsTransient obsessive compulsive disorder (1/2)17452.3 (39–61)8–223–4 (6.5–9 wks)Bilateral (P)CsA (6 mo)1.5 yrsPatient 1 (18 mo):128,162 (right), 81,905 (left);Patient 2 (19 mo):79,207 (right), 39,151 (left)Improved motor functions;Resolution of dyskinesiasCortical hemorrhage (1/4);Transient confusion and hallucinations (1/4)19,22,23557.4 (48–67)13–221–3 (6–9 wks)1 pt–unilateral (P);4 pts–unilateral (C+P)CsA (7 mo), AZA, PSL3 yrsN/AModest improvement in daily living activities (1/5)None15648.8 (43–58)7–164–8 (6–8 wks)4 pts-unilateral (P);1 pt-unilateral (C+P)CsA, AZA, PSL\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${{{{{\\rm{\\le }}}}}}$$\\end{document}≤18 yrsN/AMajor improvement (4/6);Modest changes (2/6)Atypical parkinsonism (1/6);Dementia (1/6)20,21,3020\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\le$$\\end{document}≤ 60 yrs: 50 ± 8;> 60 yrs: 65 ± 4\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\le$$\\end{document}≤ 60: 13 ± 3;> 60: 15 ± 62 (7–8 wks)Bilateral (P)None3 yrsPatient 1 (7 mo):24,115 (right), 38,392 (left);Patient 2 (36 mo):36,796 (right), 6840 (left)Improved UPDRS score in younger pts(\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\le$$\\end{document}≤ 60 yrs), but not in older pts(> 60 yrs)Dystonia and dyskinesia (5/20)37353 (48–59)10–146 (6–9 wks)Bilateral (P+SN)CsA (6 mo)1.1 yrsN/AImproved UPDRS score; Decreased L-DOPA dose requirement (1/3)None162358.5 (30–75)111–4 (6–9 wks)Bilateral (P)CsA (6 mo)2 yrs1 fVM (n = 2): 30k/side;4 fVM (n = 2): 70k-120k/sideNo improvementDyskinesia (13/23)38264 (59–69)11–152–3 (6–9 wks)Bilateral (P)CsA (6 mo)3 yrsPatient 1 (44 mo):127,189 (right), 98,913 (left);Patient 2 (52 mo):202,933 (right), 4289 (left)Improved UPDRS and Dyskinesia scoresNone27fVM fetal ventral mesencephalic, yrs years, wks weeks, mo months, C Caudate, P Putamen, SN Substantia Nigra, CsA cyclosporin A, AZA Azathioprine, PSL Prednisolone, pts patients, N/A not available, UPDRS Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, Ref.

        "Why were clinical outcomes of fVM transplantation inefficient and variable? Over the last several decades, more than 400 PD patients have undergone fVM transplantation and have been thoroughly analyzed.6–13 Additionally, stem cell scientists conducted extensive pre-clinical studies using rat and mouse embryonic VM tissues with three objectives: (1) to understand inefficient and variable clinical outcomes of fVM transplantation; (2) to elucidate the biological factors influencing the survival of transplanted cells; and (3) to enhance the survival of implanted mDANs for future successful CRTs.39–41 These clinical and pre-clinical studies revealed important insights and diverse potential factors contributing to inconsistent clinical outcomes. These factors encompass a range of variables, including the differing ages and clinical statuses of patients; varied fetal cell preparation methods; the heterogenous and variable status of fetuses (typically requiring 6 to 8 fetuses per patient); variable immune suppression regimens; and target sites of transplantation (putamen, caudate, and/or the substantia nigra) (Table 1).6–14,18–31,35,37,38,42 While all these donor- and/or host-specific factors likely play important roles in clinical outcomes, we speculate that the poor and variable survival of transplanted mDANs in the graft directly causes inefficient clinical outcomes. Indeed, this survival issue of grafted mDANs has been a focal point of CRT research since the conception of fVM transplantation due to the limited supply of aborted fetuses. As outlined in an insightful review by Brundin and colleagues,43 the survival of grafted mDANs in 31 independent studies using rat embryonic VM transplantation ranged between 0.7% and 23.3% with an average of 6.86%. Similarly, a consistent survival range between 5% and 10% was reported in transplantation studies of human VM grafts in athymic rats44,45 as well as in postmortem studies of human fVM transplantation.9,12,13,22,23,27,37,38,42 In conclusion, the pivotal lesson from previous clinical and pre-clinical studies is the highly inefficient and variable survival of grafted mDANs, which likely constitutes the root cause of the poor and inconsistent clinical outcomes observed.",
        "As described above, the survival of transplanted mDANs was extensively investigated in pre-clinical studies using rodent embryonic VM cells to model human fVM transplantation.43,46–52 A salient feature of these studies is that a great majority of mDANs die shortly after transplantation, typically within one week, and the number of surviving mDANs in the graft does not increase or change at later time points. This observation is rather surprising considering that embryonic VM cells contain a significant number of early progenitor cells in addition to already differentiated mDANs. These data suggest two possibilities: (1) progenitor cells in fVM have very limited capacity for proliferation and differentiation and/or (2) the host environment does not support their proliferation and differentiation into mDANs. Based on these pre-clinical studies, four distinct phases have been proposed during which grafted mDANs may die.43 In Phase 1 (removal of embryos), mDANs may die of hypoxic and hypoglycemic insults that occur during embryo removal from the maternal blood supply. In Phase 2 (cell preparation), mDANs may die of axotomy and other traumatic damages caused by mechanical dissociation. In Phase 3 (intrastriatal injection), mDANs may die during the implantation procedure and the immediate period following graft injection, and in Phase 4 (graft maturation), mDANs may die during maturation and innervation in the host brain.",
        "Extensive studies have been conducted to understand the poor survival of grafted mDANs and the reasons for their early death post-transplantation, revealing diverse possibilities. When mDANs, dissected from embryos, are transplanted into the striatum under PD conditions, they become deprived of nutrients and growth factors crucial for their sustenance. Aligning with this concept, pre-treatment of cells with growth factors like basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has significantly enhanced the survival of grafted mDANs. Notably, while bFGF pre-treatment resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in survival rate,53,54 continuous delivery through co-transplantation of bFGF-overexpressing fibroblasts led to a 10-fold increase, fostering more robust and rapid behavioral recovery.55 In addition, since neuronal injury is often associated with excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and calcium imbalance, researchers have explored pathways and molecules associated with these phenomena. Among these, calcium channel blockers (such as flunarizine) and lipid peroxidation inhibitors (like lazaroids) have shown notable effects on mDAN survival.56–58 Additionally, inhibition of cell death pathways, such as caspase inhibitors (e.g., Ac-YVAD-cmk) significantly enhanced mDAN survival.51",
        "Recognizing the insurmountable obstacles presented by fVM-based CRT, scientists have shifted their focus to the use of hPSCs, including hESCs and hiPSCs. One of the most important advantages of hPSCs is their indefinite self-renewal and pluripotent differentiation potential, enabling the production of unlimited amounts of transplantable cell sources. Although invaluable lessons and insights are available from previous fVM transplantation studies, it is evident that dopamine cells from fVM and hPSCs differ significantly in many aspects. While hESCs and hiPSCs share similarities, they also retain significant differences, in particular regarding their immune responses to the host.59 For instance, hESCs are inherently allogeneic and offer the advantage of being a single, standard “off the shelf” cell source, which saves time and expense. However, they require immunosuppression and are typically passaged many times, increasing the risk of harmful mutations.60 In contrast, autologous hiPSCs are derived from PD patients being treated, without the need for immunosuppression61 and would be available at earlier passages with less genetic burdens.",
        "Addressing the potential for tumor formation: the risk of tumor formation represents the most significant concern in any CRT utilizing hPSCs.62 Notably, there has not been a single case of tumor formation reported in fVM-based CRT among over 400 transplanted PD patients, nor in numerous embryonic VM-based pre-clinical studies.6–13 Currently, most CRT approaches favor the use of hPSCs, owing to their unlimited capacity for proliferation and differentiation.63 Ironically, this distinct advantage of hPSCs also presents a critical challenge due to their potential for neoplastic growth. In light of this, several important aspects must be considered for the clinical application of hPSC-based CRT.",
        "Firstly, given their tumorigenic potential, it is crucial to remove any residual undifferentiated hPSCs from the transplantable cell source. For example, if merely 0.01% of cells remain undifferentiated during in vitro differentiation, this would theoretically result in 1000 undifferentiated hPSCs in a batch of 10 million cells used for transplantation. Therefore, the complete removal of any undifferentiated cells is imperative. A promising strategy for achieving this goal involves using small molecules that can selectively target and eliminate undifferentiated hPSCs without affecting differentiated cells. For example, Lee et al.64 discovered that undifferentiated hPSCs selectively express the anti-apoptotic gene BIRC5 (encoding Survivin), unlike their differentiated counterparts. Based on this finding, a chemical method was developed using quercetin (a BIRC5 inhibitor) which can eliminate undifferentiated hPSCs with > 99.99% efficiency.65 Using qRT-PCR analysis of OCT4 expression as a surrogate marker, the estimated presence of undifferentiated cells post-quercetin treatment is approximately 0.0017 per 10 million differentiated cells,65 a rate lower than the spontaneous incidence of glioma.66 This chemical method was successfully used in the first hiPSC-based CRT for a sporadic PD patient.61",
        "Secondly, ensuring the genomic and epigenomic stability of hPSC-derived cell products is critical. It is well known that hPSCs contain and accumulate diverse mutations of various sizes (from point mutations to karyotype abnormality).67,68 These mutations may have different origins, including pre-existing somatic mutations in original cells used for reprogramming,69–73 the reprogramming process to generate hiPSCs,71,74–76 passaging,71,77 and in vitro differentiation process78 to produce transplantable cell source. Various technologies such as whole genome and exome sequencing, bulk RNA-seqencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA-seq analyses utilizing next-generation sequencing technology, have been employed to screen for genomic mutations and assess their functional consequences. Significantly, Merkle et al. conducted screenings on multiple hESC lines, discovering five of these lines, including the widely used H9, carry six mosaic mutations in TP53, which could confer a potential growth advantage.60 Therefore, periodic monitoring of putative tumorigenic mutations in hPSCs and their cell products is essential for their clinical application.79",
        "Finally, the immunogenicity of hPSC-derived cell products is a crucial consideration in their clinical application. While iPSC-derived cells are generally believed to exhibit \"negligible\" immunogenicity,80–82 the emergence of aberrant immunogenic antigens during the differentiation process can induce immune responses.83 Therefore, there has been a recent emphasis on periodically monitoring potential immunogenic factors in hPSCs and their derivatives to ensure their suitability for clinical use. This includes assessing the expression levels of immunogenic-related genes such as human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), CD80/CD86/CD40, and PD-L1/PD-L2/CD47.84–86 Such vigilance in monitoring immunogenicity is critical for the safe and effective translation of hPSC-based therapies into clinical settings.",
        "A major advantage of hPSCs lies in their potential to produce unlimited amounts of transplantable cell sources, such as mDANs. Possibly due to this advantage, cell survival in hPSC-based CRT, unlike fVM-based CRT, has not garnered sufficient attention and remains less investigated. Given the significant differences in cellular, developmental, and proliferation properties between fVM and hPSCs, both similar and distinct factors must be considered for successful CRT in PD. To address these issues, we investigated the cell survival issue of hPSC-based CRT using several rodent models such as wild type (with immunosuppression) and athymic rats as well as immunocompromised NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice and humanized NSG mice.84 Interestingly, the majority (∼90%) of mDANs (derived from both hESCs and hiPSCs) died within the first 1–2 weeks after transplantation, which is very similar to fVM transplantation.43,46–52 In addition, this study revealed that the transplantation procedure itself triggered an acute host inflammatory response. Remarkably, the host immune response was triggered even when only media was injected without any cell, indicating that this is induced by the host innate immune response. Because the immune response pattern was very similar to that of traumatic brain injury (TBI) (Fig. 1),87,88 we have termed this phenomenon “needle trauma”.84 This needle trauma appears to physically damage the host brain, leading to acute cell death of host neuronal cells around the injection path, which is thought to trigger subsequent immune responses such as immediate secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF and IL-1β), activation of astrocytes/microglia, and robust infiltration of Iba-1+ and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)II+ inflammatory cells near the needle track, which peaked at day 7 before declining at 1 month and disappeared at 6 months. Importantly, this needle trauma preferentially led to the death of most mDANs, rather than midbrain dopamine progenitors (mDAPs), within the graft. Furthermore, unlike fVM-based CRT, the total number of mDANs (and grafted cells) significantly increased during the later stage, suggesting that some mDAPs proliferated and differentiated into new mDANs in the host brain post-transplantation.84 In light of these new findings, coupled with insights from previous fVM transplantation studies,43,46–52 we propose that hPSC-derived mDANs may die during one of three phases in the hPSC-based CRT procedure (Fig. 2).Fig. 1Dynamic profiles of molecular and cellular changes following needle trauma.Upon needle injection, the brain experiences physical damage, leading to the rupture of resident cells such as neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. This rupture results from the impact of the needle, causing these cells to burst. Subsequently, the ruptured cells release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) rapidly, which affect neighboring cells and trigger the production and secretion of cytokines and chemokines due to activation. Among the cells sensing this response, neutrophils are quickly recruited to the damaged site, playing a pivotal role in promptly eliminating the debris. Concurrently, astrocytes and microglia become increasingly activated and migrate toward the damaged area over time. Approximately by the third day, peripheral monocytes infiltrate, and depending on the severity of the brain damage, T and B cells may also infiltrate, engaging in reparative functions. This sequence of inflammatory processes is crucial for the removal of cell debris resulting from needle trauma, facilitating essential steps for the repair and homeostasis of the damaged area. At the same time, however, this event appears to cause substantial damage and death to engrafted mDANs.Fig. 2Three different phases of hPSC-based CRT when mDANs may die.Schematic representation of the three phases in which mDANs can die. Phase 1 involves the in vitro differentiation of hPSCs into mDA cells, predominantly comprising mDAPs and mDANs, using optimized procedures. Phase 2 encompasses the harvesting and cryopreservation of in vitro differentiated mDA cells, emphasizing the critical steps of cryopreservation, storage, and thawing. In Phase 3, the final in vivo transplantation occurs, consisting of surgical transplantation, the early stage (< 2 weeks), and the late stage (> 2 weeks) of graft establishment. The potential challenges and considerations at each phase, including cell viability, immune responses, and environmental factors, are discussed for a comprehensive understanding of the optimization process in hPSC-based CRT for PD.",

        "In Phase 1, hESCs/hiPSCs are cultured and subsequently differentiated in vitro over a specific period using optimized procedures (Fig. 2). While various laboratories employ diverse optimized protocols,65,89–96 these methods typically use dual inhibition of SMADs, targeting BMP and TGFβ signalings, and dual activation of WNT and SHH signalings, based on previous developmental studies. This in vitro differentiation process leads to the generation of mDA cells, predominantly comprising mDAPs and mDANs, in the range of 60%–95% and 5%–25%, respectively, depending on individual protocols.65,89–96 These protocols vary in detailed methods and media components. For instance, some protocols utilize a 2D monolayer method, while others employ a combination of 2D and 3D cultures, such as embryoid bodies and floating neurosphere cultures. There is a possibility that mDA cells differentiated in vitro may lose viability during the differentiation process. For example, we observed that a significant portion of cells die and/or become apoptotic on evenly distributed monolayer culture and that dividing the monolayer into smaller isolated portions, known as the “spotting method”, significantly reduced the percentage of these unhealthy or apoptotic cells during in vitro differentiation process.65,97 Phase 1 is analogous to the initial step of fVM-based CRT, where donor embryos are dissected and prepared as either cell suspension or tissue blocks for transplantation.43 Previous studies demonstrated that the cell viability was substantially affected by different conditions and types of the grafting medium used for the preparation of fVM-derived cells.98–100 Therefore, in vitro differentiation conditions and culture media should be rigorously tested and optimized to maximize the viability. This optimization is crucial as the non-viable/apoptotic component of these final cell products will persist until transplantation and could negatively impact clinical outcomes. For instance, in conjunction with needle trauma-induced neuroinflammation, this dead or apoptotic component of transplanted cell product may trigger an additional host immune response in Phase 3. Although one can design a FACS procedure to exclude dead/dying cells, it may impose additional harmful effects on viable cells.",
        "In Phase 2, in vitro differentiated mDA cells are harvested and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until transplantation (Fig. 2). Recent studies indicate that hPSC-derived mDA cells can be cryopreserved without losing their viability, cellular phenotypes, and in vivo function.65,93,101–103 Consequently, most groups are planning to incorporate this cryopreservation step in hPSC-based CRT. Phase 2 comprises three key steps: (i) harvesting and cryopreserving the in vitro differentiated mDA cells using an optimal cryopreservation medium in cryovials; (ii) storing multiple cryovials in liquid nitrogen; and (iii) thawing the cryovials and loading mDA cells into a surgical syringe before transplantation. In theory, mDA cells can undergo cell death at any of these steps. For example, although hPSC-derived mDA cells have been reported to maintain their viability and function, the duration for which they can be stored in liquid nitrogen without compromising their viability and function remains an area of uncertainty. Given that needle trauma has been observed to preferentially affect mDANs more than mDAPs, it is plausible that the impact of cryopreservation and subsequent handling varies significantly depending on cell types.84 Therefore, revisiting this issue and systematically analyzing the viability of different cell types at each step could be crucial for the final optimization of the process.",
        "Phase 3 constitutes the final in vivo transplantation step and encompasses (i) surgical transplantation, (ii) the early stage (< 2 weeks), and (iii) the late stage (> 2 weeks) of graft establishment (Fig. 2). Host immune responses operate at these steps and may lead to the death of mDA cells. During the initial step of graft injection, mDA cells may retain viability in the syringe for a limited period (e.g., 10–20 min). However, prolonged delays during the injection process, exceeding the norm in clinical procedures, may result in the death of a portion of mDA cells (especially mDANs) even before they are injected into the host brain. Thus, minimizing delay in the surgical procedure is advisable. Notably, the surgical procedure itself appears to trigger acute innate immune responses, culminating in a hostile neuroinflammation environment. Injected mDANs are consequently subjected to early and preferential cell death. Furthermore, an adaptive immune response between grafted cells and the host immune system may occur, potentially leading to graft rejection in the absence of immunosuppression. In the later stage of engraftment in Phase 3, surviving mDA cells undergo maturation, differentiation, and integration into the host brain to establish new functional circuits. However, it is plausible that a portion of new and/or maturing mDANs may succumb even at this late stage due to various factors such as continued host immune responses, insufficient essential factors (e.g., blood supply, growth factors, and oxygen), and an unfavorable PD environment characterized by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and α-synucleinopathy.",
        "The survival of engrafted mDA cells is significantly influenced by various levels of host immune responses. A fundamental requirement for the survival of transplanted cells is to evade graft rejection, a process regulated by the host’s adaptive immune system. Traditionally, certain specialized organs such as the brain and the eye have been considered immune-privileged,104 which might explain why an earlier fVM transplantation study did not use immunosuppressants (Table 1). Conversely, an opposing viewpoint suggests that even autologous cells can elicit an immune response if differentiated cell products express immunogenic antigens.83,105 To investigate this contentious issue of immunogenicity in autologous vs allogeneic intracerebral grafts, we conducted transplantation experiments involving patient-derived and allogeneic mDA cells into the striatum of NSG mice, patient-humanized NSG mice, and allogeneic humanized NSG mice. Our findings revealed that while autologous mDA cells were rejected in allogeneic humanized mice, they were accepted in autologous humanized mice,61 indicating that allogeneic mDA cells would likely be rejected without immunosuppression when transplanted into the brain. It is noteworthy that the brain’s immune privilege may require an intact blood–brain barrier (BBB), which could be compromised in PD brains106 as well as by the surgical procedure. Additionally, our recent study suggests that the host immune system interacts not only with grafted cells but also with the surgical instrument, namely the needle, underscoring the critical role of the host innate immune response in the process,84 as described below.",
        "The adaptive immune response plays a pivotal role in the rejection of allogeneic or xenogeneic grafts.107 This adaptive immunity is characterized by the precise and sensitive reactions of T and B cells to MHCs, also known as HLA, expressed by all nucleated cells. Even slight differences in the expression of HLA molecule(s) by grafted cells can trigger active elimination by the body. Therefore, significant immunosuppression is required even for intracerebral transplantation of allogeneic mDA cells. Indeed, all current and future clinical trials involving allogeneic hPSC-derived mDA cells plan to use substantial levels of immunosuppression.90,93,95,108 It is crucial to acknowledge that long-term immunosuppression is associated with diverse side effects, including susceptibility to infections and malignancies, along with additional costs and inconvenience. Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between infection risk and the dose and duration of immunosuppressants,109,110 with risks and severity of infection increasing when used in combination with other immunosuppressants.111 Additionally, immunosuppression with cyclosporine is known to elevate the risk of malignancies such as lymphoma or skin cancer.112,113 Other side effects may include loss of appetite, vomiting, nausea, and tremors, although these symptoms typically subside as the body adapts to immunosuppressants. Given these various side effects, researchers are actively exploring ways to optimize the administration route, dosage and duration of immunosuppression. For example, a promising strategy involves leveraging local immunosuppression to circumvent the systemic side effects associated with standard immunosuppression.114",
        "Innate immunity constitutes the body’s initial line of defense, encompassing physical, chemical, and cellular mechanisms to promptly counteract or eliminate foreign antigens introduced from external sources.107,115 Unlike adaptive immunity, which is acquired through exposure to invaders, innate immunity is inherently present at birth and relies on antigen-nonspecific defense mechanisms. The primary function of innate immunity is to directly eliminate pathogens, and most importantly, to rapidly recruit immune cells to the site of infection and inflammation.116,117 This is achieved through sensing pathogens and producing cytokines (e.g., TNFα, IL-1β, IFNγ) and chemokines (e.g., CXCL, CCL). Additionally, innate immunity responds to physical damage resulting from external mechanical forces. A representative example is neuroinflammation induced by TBI, where initial traumatic insults trigger disruption of both macro-barriers (e.g., the skin) and micro-barriers (e.g., cell membranes), leading to secretion of diverse immune molecules.118",
        "Our recent study showed that the transplantation procedure using a needle prominently triggers host innate immune responses, which was termed “needle trauma’ due to its similarity to TBI (Fig. 1).84 Primary TBI occurs immediately after the impact, damaging physical structures of the brain, including meningeal and neuronal contusion, axonal shearing, and blood vessel damage. Secondary TBI develops gradually, involving various cellular processes, such as BBB disturbance, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell loss.115 Since needle trauma similarly induces these downstream pathways, further elucidation may provide promising molecular targets to mitigate its effects on the survival of grafted mDA cells, thereby potentially enhancing the outcomes of hPSC-based CRT (see below). It is worth noting that PD patients typically exhibit elevated levels of both brain inflammation and systemic inflammation compared to healthy individuals.119–121 This heightened inflammatory state in PD patients may potentially exert a more pronounced adverse impact on the outcome of CRT. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that the systemic immune system varies significantly among individuals, including those with PD, which may lead to differences in treatment outcomes due to these immunological differences. However, it is important to acknowledge that the primary factor influencing the survival of transplanted mDANs is the inflammation triggered by brain damage resulting from the transplantation procedure itself. Consequently, further research efforts are needed to fully understand the distinct roles of intrinsic inflammatory states and surgery-induced inflammation in determining the survival of grafted mDANs.",
        "Although hPSC-based CRT offers the advantage of generating an unlimited number of transplantable cells, it also faces the challenge of poor survival hPSC-derived mDANs, as evidenced by previous pre-clinical studies (Table 2).96,122–131 Therefore, developing novel strategies to enhance the survival of mDANs during CRT is imperative. One promising approach is modifying the host immune responses to create a more favorable environment for the transplanted cells.Table 2List of representative preclinical studies using PSC-derived mDA cells.GraftHostApplicationNumber of grafted cellsNumber of survived TH+ cellsRef.hESC-mDA precursorsNSG mouseN/A150,0004500 ± 100094SD rat250,00014,500 ± 5000hiPSC-NPCNOD-SCID mouseN/A1 × 1057500 ± 3500 (D28 without Shh and FGF8)2000 ± 1500 (D28 with Shh and FGF8)< 500 (D42 without Shh and FGF8)< 500 (D42 with Shh and FGF8)131Cynomolgus monkey2.4 × 106 (right)2.4 × 106 (left)3.07 × 104 (right, d28 spheres),1.26 × 105 (left, d42 spheres)hESC-NPCCynomolgus monkeyN/A4.8 × 1061.3–18.6 × 103 in each side130PiPSC-mDANsSD ratN/A100,000–200,0002791–18,684 (sorted NCAM+/CD29low)4835–22,666 (unsorted)129hESC-mDANsAthymic ratN/A150,000986 ± 333128hiPSC-mDAPsSD ratSorting: CORIN+4 × 105Unsorted:3436 ± 2384 (D28)N/A (D42)CORIN+ sorted:6747 ± 2341 (D28)1900 ± 658 (D42)127CM-iPSC-mDANsCynomolgus monkeyN/AMF25–04 : 1 × 10713,029 (MF25–04)134MF27-04, MF66-02 : 4 × 1078551 (MF27-04), 7938 (MF66-02)hESC-mDANsSCID mouseN/A2 × 1057555 ± 913 (hM4Di-), 7245 ± 517 (hM3Dq-),6110 ± 254 (EGFP-expressing cell)126hESC/hiPSC-mDAPsSD ratSorting: LRTM1+1.3 × 105Unsorted:1102 ± 349LRTM1+ sorted:11,702 ± 2566125Cynomolgus monkey1 × 106N/ALRTM1+ sorted:~2.4 × 106hiPSC-mDAPsCynomolgus monkeyN/A4.8 × 106Healthy : 5.4 ± 4.7 × 104PD : 7.3 ± 5.3 × 104124hESC-mDAPsFischer 344 ratEncapsulation: HA-heparin-RGD hydrogel89,500 (2D)2D, Suspension: ∼120017093,800 (3D)3D, HA hydrogel: ∼6400hiPSC-mDAPsAthymic ratN/A100,0005621 ± 1029 per 100,00065hESC-PITX3/LMX1A-GFP VM mDAPsAthymic ratAAV-GDNF100,000PITX3-GFP+ cells:4092 ± 602+ GDNF:PITX3-GFP+ cells7986 ± 1375123LMX1A-GFP+ cells:19,810 ± 2828+ GDNF:LMX1A-GFP+ cells30,381 ± 6513hiPSC-mDAPsF344-Il2rgem2Kyo X-SCID ratZonisamide5 × 1053.17 ± 1.64 × 103 (vehicle)7.5 ± 1.95 × 103 (+ZNS 30 mg/kg)8.16 ± 3.43 × 103 (+ZNS 60 mg/kg)122hiPSC-mDAPsF344 Njc1-rnu/rnu ratN/A4 × 1052835 ± 253490hESC-mDAPsAthymic ratN/A400,00049,250 (male), 42,480 (female)93hiPSC-mDA neurospheresF344 Njc1-rnu/rnu ratN/A400,000 (fresh)400,000 (cryopreservedX1)800,000 (cryopreservedX2)4601 ± 1189 (fresh)1306 ± 480 (cryopreservedX1)3988 ± 1961 (cryopreservedX2)102hiPSC-PITX3-GFP mDAPsAthymic ratAAV-GDNF100,00018,910 ± 1853 (Homotopic)20,550 ± 1616 (Ectopic)+ GDNF:28,088 ± 2618 (Homotopic)24,396 ± 1180 (Ecotopic)177hiPSC-mDAPsNSG mouseTREG100,000+ Saline:1825 ± 287 (2 weeks)5421 ± 534 (20 weeks)+ TREG :4427 ± 189 (2 weeks)9523 ± 835 (20 weeks)84hESC-mDAPsAthymic ratN/A30,000∼19009560,000∼3700120,000∼8000hESC-mDAPsAthymic ratN/A5000758.86 ± 286.009610,0001477.71 ± 529.7925,0002820.00 ± 1378.86100,00017,598.40 ± 5451.54hESC human embryonic stem cell, mDA midbrain dopaminergic, NSG NOD SCID gamma, SD Sprague Dawley, hiPSC human induced pluripotent stem cell, NPC neural progenitor cell, NOD nonobese diabetic, SCID severe combined immunodeficient, Shh sonic hedgehog, FGF8 fibroblast growth factor 8, PiPSC primate induced pluripotent stem cell, mDANs midbrain dopaminergic neurons, NCAM neural cell adhesion molecule, CM Cynomolgus monkey, mDAPs midbrain dopaminergic progenitor cells, PD Parkinson’s disease, ZNS Zonisamide, GDNF Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, RGD Arginylglycylaspartic acid, HA Hyaluronic acid, TREG Regulatory T cells, Ref. reference.",

        "A prerequisite for the survival of grafted cells is to circumvent graft rejection. Consequently, all allogeneic transplantations require a significant level of immunosuppression, although the duration of immunosuppression required for each patient remains uncertain. Recent studies in nonhuman primates132–134 and humans61 have demonstrated that autologous transplantations do not require immunosuppression. However, this autologous approach entails substantial time and expense. An alternative strategy to mitigate the need for immunosuppression involves using HLA-matched iPSCs. Supporting evidence for this approach comes from a recent primate study indicating that transplantation of mDA cells from HLA-matched primate iPSCs reduced host immune responses and increased the survival of mDANs.12 Consequently, numerous groups are striving to establish HLA-matched hiPSCs as a bank from common HLA-homozygous donors, aiming to minimize graft rejection post-transplantation and reduce the time and effort compared to the autologous approach (Fig. 3).135,136 Yamanaka’s group estimated that hiPSC lines derived from approximately 140 unique HLA-homozygous donors would be sufficient to cover up to 90% of the Japanese population.137 Due to genetic diversity, large-scale hPSC banks are currently being established in the United States to cover diverse ethnic groups such as European Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians.138 Despite these efforts, the immune response may still occur even with HLA-matched cells due to indirect pathway caused by H-Y minor histocompatibility antigens or innate immunity resulting from natural killer (NK) cells.139,140Fig. 3Strategies targeting adaptive immunity.In general, allogeneic transplantation using mDA cells derived from hESCs still necessitates immunosuppression, whereas autologous transplantation with mDA cells from hiPSCs is characterized by immune tolerance, eliminating the need for immunosuppressants. An alternative strategy, distinct from utilizing autologous cells, involves the application of HLA-matched hiPSCs to reduce the risk of graft rejection, with ongoing efforts to establish an HLA-matched iPSC bank encompassing a diverse array of donors. Another approach focuses on the development of \"universal donor stem cells,\" incorporating genetic modifications, such as CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of HLA class I and II components, along with lentiviral overexpression of the immune receptor CD47 or HLA-E/G transgene.",

        "Efforts to develop “universal donor stem cells” that evade immune rejection have garnered significant attention.141,142 This approach primarily aims to eliminate HLA molecules in donor cells, which are pivotal for adaptive immunity and graft rejection. The initial endeavor aimed to eliminate HLA molecules, specifically targeting HLA class I, which predominantly expresses β2-microtubulin (B2M), a structurally non-polymorphic heavy chain, across most cell types.143,144 However, cells lacking HLA class I, generated through the genomic engineering approach, exhibited limitations as they were susceptible to lysis by NK cells via a ‘missing self’ response.145 Notably, the lysis mechanism is averted when the CD94/NGK2A complex on NK cells engages with any HLA class I molecule, including HLA-E, recognized for its minimal polymorphism and expression solely in B2M knockout cells.145,146 Recently, through the process of technology development and optimization, Schrepfer and colleagues147 devised a method to generate hypoimmunogenic donor iPSCs through three steps: (1) CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the B2M gene (a component of HLA class I), and (2) the CIITA gene (the master regulator of HLA class II), and (3) the lentiviral overexpression of the immune receptor CD47 transgene. They demonstrated that various cell types derived from these engineered donor iPSCs (e.g., endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes) effectively evade immune rejection in fully HLA-mismatched host animals and survive long-term without immunosuppression. Additionally, Hotta and colleagues created pseudo-homozygous iPSC lines by disrupting HLA-A and HLA-B bi-allelically while retaining a single HLA-C allele using CRISPR-Cas9.148 It is estimated that 12 HLA-C-retained iPSC lines with HLA-class II knockout could be immunologically compatible with > 90% of the world’s population. While these strategies hold promise for iPSC-based regenerative medicine applications, it remains uncertain whether these engineered cells would retain full functionality and hypoimmunogenicity post-transplantation into patients.149 Extensive genetic manipulation (e.g., ectopic CD47 expression) may lead to unforeseen adverse effects like oncogenic transformation and compromised immune responses.150,151 Moreover, in instances where a cell becomes infected with a virus, prompt removal may not be feasible, prompting the need for the development of genetic integration of kill-switches. Taken together, this strategy could potentially induce unintended adverse reactions, necessitating further research to refine and implement safety strategies.152,153 Furthermore, even if these genetic alterations successfully evade immune rejection by adaptive immunity, the transplanted grafts may still be susceptible to innate immune responses by needle trauma.",
        "The host innate immune response triggered by TBI or needle trauma initiates acute inflammation after injury. This response is characterized by the secretion and upregulation of DAMPs, cytokines, chemokines, immune cell infiltration (e.g., neutrophils and myeloid cells), and subsequent activation of glial cells (astrocyte and microglia) and recruitment of leukocytes.107,115,154 Numerous studies have demonstrated that these molecules including DAMPs, cytokines, and chemokines, are acutely secreted after TBI within 6 h.155 Consequently, various research endeavors have sought to target innate immunity for therapeutic development in TBI. These investigations have revealed that blocking those molecules using specific inhibitors resulted in prominent effects to treat TBI in animal models.156–159 It will be intriguing to determine whether these inhibitors and/or neutralizing antibodies can produce similar effects in needle trauma and improve the survival of engrafted mDA cells. This avenue warrants future investigation (Fig. 4). Moreover, considering that needle trauma acutely triggers the secretion of various cytokines, chemokines, and DAMPs (within minutes to hours post-injury), an intriguing approach could involve delaying the grafting of cells post-needle insertion (without cells). Indeed, previous studies have shown that neuronal survival markedly increased when the injection of dopaminergic cell suspension was delayed for more than one hour following cannula insertion.160,161Fig. 4Strategies targeting innate immunity.In CRT, the standard procedure involves the injection of cells into the brain using a needle, which induces needle trauma and subsequent secretion of various innate immune response factors, including DAMPs, pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. These factors activate surrounding glial cells and lead to the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, contributing positively to damage repair. However, they also exert a detrimental effect on grafted cells, resulting in severe cell death of mDANs. A potential strategy to enhance the survival of grafted cells involves obtaining autologous TREG cells from the patient, increasing their quantity and functionality, and confirming improved therapeutic effects through co-transplantation into the brain. Additionally, exploring the efficacy of inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, and encapsulation methods to enhance the survival of grafted cells within the inflammatory microenvironment, combined with the application of TREG technology, represents a promising direction for future advancements in CRT.",

        "Regulatory T (TREG) cells play a vital role in maintaining immunological tolerance and homeostasis.162,163 They are implicated in numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and have been clinically utilized to improve survival rates in various organ transplantations through adoptive transfer after ex vivo expansion.164 In TBI, TREG cells infiltrate the damaged area following initial inflammatory cell infiltration to facilitate the repair process.165,166 Therefore, it was hypothesized that autologous TREG cells might mitigate the innate immune response triggered by needle trauma and enhance the survival of grafted mDANs. In testing the effect of TREG cells via conventional adoptive transfer,164,167 approximately 1,000,000 ex vivo expanded autologous TREG cells, were intravenously injected, leading to a modest but significant reduction in the innate immune response, as indicated by decreased infiltration of MHCII+ cells. However, due to the rapid onset of needle trauma-induced neuroinflammation in the brain, the adoptive transfer method may be inefficient as it requires time for the TREG cells to infiltrate and function. Direct intra-striatal transplantation of only 2% (20,000) TREG cells, on the other hand, led to robust suppression of needle trauma-induced inflammation and significantly increased the survival of grafted mDANs (Table 2), accompanied by faster and more pronounced behavioral improvement in rodent models of PD.84 Nevertheless, the rescue of mDANs was incomplete, suggesting that further optimization of intra-striatal co-transplantation of TREG cells is necessary. One potential approach could involve encapsulating TREG and mDA cells using hydrogel systems before transplantation (Fig. 4).168–170 Additionally, considering that needle trauma may occur in CRT for other CNS and non-CNS diseases, it is of significant interest to test whether TREG cell co-transplantation can similarly reduce needle trauma-induced inflammation and enhance the survival of desired therapeutic cell products in general.171",
        "Even if grafted mDA cells manage to evade the initial immune attacks post-transplantation and survive the early stage, they face a suboptimal environment unlike early brain development, where all necessary nutrients, oxygen, growth factors, relevant transcription factors, and developmental signals are provided or induced in a precise temporal and spatial manner. Instead, the new environment of grafted mDA cells is characterized by aged PD pathological conditions such as elevated neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, α-synucleinopathy, and limited/no supply of essential factors.172,173 Indeed, recent single-cell RNA-seq analyses have revealed that grafted cells often exhibit inadequate and inefficient differentiation into mDANs, favoring instead the differentiation into alternative cell types such as astrocytes and vascular leptomeningeal cells.174 These inadequate and heterogeneous graft cell populations may be non-functional and could potentially induce unwanted immunogenicity. This challenge is compounded by the lengthy process for these mDA cells to mature into mDANs with neuronal outgrowth, reinnervate to host brain, and eventually establish functional new networks. This process can take considerable time ranging from 4–6 months in rodent brains to 1–3 years in human brains (Table 1). Therefore, it is crucial to develop and implement therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing the survival, differentiation, and/or maturation of grafted mDA cells. Supporting this idea, pre-treatment of fVM cells with growth factors such as bFGF and GDNF increased the survival of grafted mDANs about 2-fold,53,54 while long-term supply of bFGF led to a 10-fold increase in the number of survived mDANs.55 Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that pretreatment or viral delivery of GDNF enhanced the survival and differentiation of hPSCs (Table 2).123,175–177 Building upon these promising findings, a potential strategy involves facilitating the sustained supply of relevant growth factor(s) and/or transcription factor(s), which may not only enhance the survival of grafted mDA cells but also promote their differentiation into new mDANs.",
        "Since the hallmark pathological feature of PD is the selective loss of mDANs in the substantia nigra, CRT has been the focus of extensive studies for over four decades. In particular, fVM-based CRT has provided not only proof-of-concept but also invaluable lessons. Among these, the most significant lesson is that the survival of implanted mDANs is very limited, potentially underlying the variable and often inefficient clinical outcomes. Despite significant research efforts, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the acute and extensive death of mDANs post-transplantation remain only partially understood.",
        "Recent advancements in stem cell technology offer promise for hPSC-based CRT, with various hPSC sources (e.g., allogeneic hESCs, allogeneic hiPSCs, HLA-matched hiPSCs, and autologous hiPSCs) being explored for scalable production of transplantable mDA cells in ongoing or upcoming clinical trials. However, several critical issues must be addressed for the successful implementation of hPSC-based CRT. Firstly, improving the survival of implanted mDANs is paramount, drawing from lessons learned from fVM-based CRT. Secondly, addressing the multiple phases and steps of CRT where mDANs are at risk of dying is essential. Thirdly, understanding and manipulating both host adaptive and innate immune responses are crucial, with recent evidence highlighting the role of the surgical procedure in triggering host innate immune responses. Future research efforts should focus on developing effective strategies to manipulate host immune responses to enhance the survival of implanted mDANs and improve clinical outcomes.",
        "It is important to note that, although grafted mDANs may survive post-transplantation, they face the unfavorable PD host environment including neuroinflammation, α-synucleinopathy, and limited supply of essential factors. These challenges make their prolonged survival and maturation very difficult, necessitating further research in this aspect. Additionally, PD patients often exhibit degeneration of other neurons beyond mDANs, such as noradrenergic and/or serotonergic neurons,178–181 contributing to various non-motor deficits. Therefore, even the most successful hPSC-based CRT may not provide a ‘cure’ for PD. Instead, it is expected to be an integral component of a comprehensive treatment strategy, complementing other approaches such as novel drug treatment (e.g., anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective) and gene therapy.",

        "Growing evidence highlights that neuroinflammatory processes contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) [1]. In this setting, α‐synuclein (α‐syn), a presynaptic neuronal protein that is linked genetically and neuropathologically to PD, is emerging as a bridging element between the trigger of neuro/immune‐inflammatory responses and the progression of neurodegeneration in PD [2]. Accumulation of misfolded and aggregated α‐syn in neurons and non‐neuronal cells of the brain and peripheral autonomic networks, as well as in circulating exosomes and gut, can compromise synaptic transmissions, act as prion‐like protein contributing to disease spreading and trigger neurogenic/inflammatory responses in PD [3, 4]. For instance, intestinal pathological α‐syn injection in mice was associated with gut‐to‐brain spread of α‐synucleinopathy and associated neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits via vagal transmission [5]. In parallel, pathological α‐syn might result in robust activation of immune and inflammatory cells that, in turn, may contribute to systemic and central neuroinflammation associated with PD [1, 6]. Of interest, recent and pioneering evidence suggests that the initial localization of pathological α‐syn forms can also identify specific PD phenotypes; α‐syn accumulation primarily in the brain appears to identify a “brain first” PD phenotype, while an early α‐syn deposition in the gut identifies a “body first” PD phenotype characterized by early autonomic dysfunction and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) during the prodromal phase [7].",
        "On these bases, the present review provides a comprehensive overview of the available knowledge on the physiological and pathological forms of α‐syn and critically discusses, covering clinical and basic research aspects, how central and systemic α‐syn deposition is at the crossroads between neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in PD. In addition, we review clinical evidence showing a correlation between the accumulation of α‐syn in central and peripheral tissues and PD diagnosis, duration, motor and non‐motor symptoms, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Special attention was also paid to discuss whether current pharmacological strategies aimed at counteracting α‐syn can represent a suitable therapeutical approach for PD.",
        "α‐Syn was first isolated in 1988 from the Torpedo electric organ and named after its localization on synaptic vesicles and nuclear envelopes [8]. The human 140‐aminoacid homolog was identified a few years later in the brain [9]. These first observations on α‐syn found relatively little echo until 1997 when point mutations in the six‐exon gene that encodes α‐syn (SNCA) mapping to chromosome 4q21 were identified as a rare cause of autosomal‐dominant PD [10]. The same year, it was shown that Lewy bodies (LBs) and neurites (LNs), the pathological hallmarks of PD, were highly immunoreactive for α‐syn in sporadic PD brains, thereby suggesting that α‐syn was one of the main components of these intraneuronal inclusions [11].",
        "Since 1997, a large body of work focused on the physiological and pathological roles of α‐syn. α‐Syn is composed of three biochemically distinct domains: (i) a highly conserved and positively charged amino‐terminal repeat (residues 1–60) showing similarity with apolipoproteins, which allows the protein to fold into an amphipathic α‐helix when it is bound to lipid membranes or in the presence of phospholipids [12] (ii) a central hydrophobic region (amino acids 61–95) known as non‐amyloid component (NAC), which contains a 12‐aminoacid stretch that is necessary and sufficient to form the proteolysis‐resistant fibril core [13], and (iii) a C‐terminal acidic tail (amino acids 96–140) accountable for most interactions with other proteins and small molecules that contains most of the phosphorylation sites and especially serine 129 (pS129) (Figure 1). The exact physiological functions of α‐syn are still elusive, but its association with the distal reserve pool of synaptic vesicles and the deficiencies in synaptic transmissions observed in response to overexpression or suppression of the SNCA gene suggest that it plays a role in the release of neurotransmitter and synaptic homeostasis, thereby influencing neuronal plasticity and survival [14]. Recent evidence also suggests that low levels of α‐syn in the nucleus of neuronal cells can influence cell transcription [15].",
        "Schematic illustration of α‐synuclein pathway (a) α‐syn structure: 1. the amphipathic N‐terminal region (red), implicated in interactions with membranes. It contains the highly conserved 11‐residue repeats‐KTKEGV (yellow); 2. The hydrophobic NAC region (orange), has a major role in aggregation; 3. The negatively charged C‐terminal region (purple), regulates α‐syn interactions with other ligands. (b) In physiological status (green), α‐syn can be present through unstructured soluble monomeric and tetrameric forms. In pathological status (red), α‐syn aggregates into oligomers‐protofibrils, and fibrils, resulting in the development of Lewy Body. Abbreviations: AA, amino acids; α‐syn, α‐synunclein; T, temperature. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]",
        "As a typical intrinsically disordered protein, α‐syn adopts a monomeric, random coil conformation under physiological conditions [16]. It has also been suggested that physiological α‐syn occurs as a stable α‐helically‐folded tetramer that is resistant to amyloid formation [17], but these findings are still highly debated [18]. α‐syn has a natural propensity to aggregate, and this phenomenon is strongly influenced by the cellular environment [19]. For instance, lowering of pH, increasing of temperature, hormonal changes, and oxidative stress, together with increases in hydrophobicity or decreases in charge, can modify α‐syn conformation, thereby influencing its misfolding and aggregation [20, 21, 22]. These processes involve the formation of non‐fibrillar off‐pathway and soluble transient pre‐fibrillar intermediate species, regarded as oligomers and protofibrils, which eventually convert into insoluble fibrillar aggregates with distinct cross β‐sheet conformation [16]: these two species seem to be more neurotoxic than mature fibrils due to their instability and smaller size [23, 24]. The increase in wild‐type α‐syn or mutated α‐syn can promote intracellular accumulation and accelerate the fibrillation process via a nucleation‐dependent mechanism [25]. The long‐term consequences of β‐strand α‐syn aggregates are the disruption of neuronal functions with consequent neuronal death [26]. Specifically, overexpression of α‐syn inhibits endoplasmic reticulum (ER)‐Golgi trafficking and Golgi fragmentation, impairs mitochondrial function, blocks ubiquitin‐proteasome system, and alters the lysosomal system [27, 28]. Abnormal or increased α‐syn has also been associated with suppression of exo/endocytosis processes, altering the distribution of synaptic Soluble N‐ethylmaleimide‐sensitive factor activating protein receptor (SNARE) proteins and influencing the activity of other peripheral proteins such as complexins and synapsins [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. In addition to the effects of the microenvironment, α‐syn post‐translational modifications also have a major impact on protein conformation. A very large number of α‐syn post‐translational modifications have been identified so far, but the most frequent and by far the most studied is phosphorylation at serine 129. While, under physiological conditions, only a small proportion of α‐syn is phosphorylated (estimated around 4%) [35], more than 90% of α‐syn is phosphorylated on this residue, suggesting a role for pS129 in inclusion formation [35, 36].",
        "Although initially considered as being purely intracellular, it is now well demonstrated that α‐syn can be secreted by cells. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how cytosolic α‐syn, either monomeric or aggregated, is conveyed into the extracellular milieu, including unconventional exocytosis [37, 38], exosomes [39, 40], and membrane nanotubes [41]. These findings were corroborated in vivo by showing that both monomeric and oligomeric α‐syn could be detected in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy and PD subjects [42, 43]. The secretion of α‐syn aggregates from neuronal cells can depend on various stress cellular conditions (e.g., proteasomal and mitochondrial dysfunction, unconventional ER/Golgi‐independent exocytosis) or dopamine that, besides increasing the formation of non‐fibrillar α‐syn oligomers, enhances the secretion process [44]. Once dispersed in the extracellular milieu, α‐syn can be passively or endocytically internalized by other neuronal, glial, and immune/inflammatory cells, and a few receptors have been so far identified which can facilitate such a process, including heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) [44] and toll‐like receptor 2 (TLR2) [45]. A role for the lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) has also been suggested [46], but these findings are still debated [47]. All these receptors preferentially bind α‐syn in the amyloid over the monomeric state to initiate cell‐to‐cell transmission and/or to activate inflammatory response in microglia [44, 46, 47], while monomeric‐syn seems to be predominantly internalized via a passive mechanism [48]. Several in vitro studies showed that once internalized, extracellular misfolded α‐syn, either oligomeric or in the form of preformed fibrils, is capable of promoting the recruitment of endogenous soluble α‐syn into insoluble deposits in a mechanism reminiscent of the nucleation capacity of prions [49, 50]. Following these in vitro findings, the transmission and propagation of α‐syn along neuronal connections have been observed after injection of pathological α‐syn (either obtained from diseased brain homogenates or by generating preformed fibrils from recombinant protein) in the brain or peripheral autonomic nervous systems of rodents and non‐human primates [3, 51, 52, 53, 54].",
        "Taken as a whole, these results show that α‐syn can transmit the aggregation process between cells and tissues and, therefore, confirm that it could behave like a prion or at least like a propagon [55]. They might also explain the presence of α‐syn–positive inclusions in grafted neurons in PD subjects who had received fetal neuron transplants [56, 57], and they provide a molecular basis to the spreading of PD pathology in specific stages as proposed initially by Braak and more recently by Borghammer [7, 58].",
        "Of interest, there is evidence that peripheral α‐syn can spread and contribute to brain pathology [2, 59]. Specifically, peripheral infusion of α‐syn seeds may induce central nervous system (CNS) α‐syn pathology. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain CNS neuroinvasion, but retrograde axonal transport (e.g., through the vagal nerve) is thought to be the main pathway advancing α‐syn pathology via anatomically interconnected pathways of susceptible cell populations [59]. Indeed, the propagation of α‐syn is aligned with the stereotypical pattern of progressive LB as proposed by Braak and colleagues and with the appearance of clinical signs in the disease course [58, 60]. Indeed, in most cases of PD, the pathological process has been hypothesized to start with the α‐syn accumulation in the olfactory structures or the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and, subsequently, to spread in a trans‐synaptic prion‐like fashion in the CNS, contributing to brain pathology [61]. Supporting this view, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy has been found to prevent the spread of misfolded α‐syn from the gut to substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) as well as the occurrence of parkinsonism in an environmental animal model following injections of α‐syn preformed fibrils in the gut [5, 62]. Moreover, the injection of human α‐syn into the rat nodose ganglion spread to gastric vagal endings as well as to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve [63]. A recent study has also reported that the centripetal spreading of misfolded α‐syn could also be mediated by enteroendocrine cells lining the GI tract [64].",
        "Based on this body of evidence, it has been hypothesized that the initial localization of pathological α‐syn forms can also identify specific PD subtypes. In particular, α‐syn accumulation primarily in the brain appears to identify a “brain first” PD phenotype, while an early α‐syn deposition in the gut identifies a “body first” PD phenotype characterized by early autonomic dysfunction and RBD [7, 65, 66].",
        "α‐syn is expressed in neuronal and non‐neuronal cell types, including central and enteric neurons, astrocytes, microglia, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, NK cells, B and T cells, enterochromaffin cells (ECs) and skin cells, and its pathological forms can influence cell functions [67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72]. In particular, oligomeric, aggregated, fibrils, and phosphorylated α‐syn forms can contribute to neuronal degeneration, activation of immune/inflammatory cell pathways, alterations of cell morphology and motility, impairments of gut barrier, and skin remodeling, degeneration and inflammation (Figure 2). Of note, several studies have focused on the characterization of the role of α‐syn in promoting central and peripheral neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes that can contribute to PD pathology. Thus, based on the recent and pioneering brain‐first and body‐first PD hypothesis, the most prominent data on the role of central and enteric neuronal and non‐neuronal α‐syn in PD pathophysiology are addressed in the following sections and represented in Figure 3.",
        "Schematic representation of the effects of α‐synuclein on neuronal and non‐neuronal cells. (a) Neurons: α‐syn aggregates, Lewy bodies or Lewy neurites, can promote ROS formation, alter cellular components, including proteins and DNA, and induce mitochondrial dysfunction, with consequent axonal transport disruption and synaptic dysfunction. In parallel, pathological α‐syn can trigger the polarization of astrocytes to neurotoxic A1 phenotype, leading to the release of ROS and pro‐inflammatory cytokines in the extracellular space. (b) Immune/inflammatory cells: α‐syn can be produced within immune cells that express the SNCA gene (1) or its pathological forms can be internalized from the extracellular space via endocytosis (2). Once in the intracellular space, α‐syn can seed and accumulate, forming oligomers, fibrils, and aggregates, triggering inflammatory pathways, including NLRP3 inflammasome signaling (5). Of note, both pathological and physiological forms of α‐syn can interact with TLR‐2/4 (4), promoting cellular polarization towards a pro‐inflammatory phenotype as well as the recruitment and activation of other immune/inflammatory cells (5). α‐syn can also interfere with MHC and SNARE complexes, thereby affecting antigen presentation and the trafficking of cell‐surface receptors (6, 7). (c) Physiological α‐syn in melanocytes promotes the melanin‐producing process. In keratinocytes, oligomeric α‐syn induces the release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, such as IL‐1β and TNF. Additionally, α‐syn can be internalized by fibroblasts, leading to increased mitochondrial dysfunction, alterations in the cytoskeleton, and in turn, fibroblast cell death.

        "Schematic representation of the interplay between α‐synuclein, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (a) Within the CNS, pathological α‐syn species are found in neuronal and non‐neuronal cells, including dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and microglial and astroglial cells, respectively, as well as in the extracellular space (1, 2, 3). The intra‐ and extracellular α‐syn promotes neuronal death (1), spreads, in a prion‐like manner, among neuronal cells (2), and induces microglial and astroglial activation (3), that, besides contributing to neurogenic/inflammatory responses, promotes the recruitment of peripheral immune/inflammatory cells (4), that further amplifying the ongoing neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory processes. (b) The accumulation of pathological α‐syn in the ENS (1), in immune cells (2) as well as in gut barrier cells (3) can promote neurogenic/inflammatory responses, compromise further intestinal barrier integrity and permeability, and favor changes in microbiota composition (4). These events can contribute to the translocation of pathogens in the bloodstreams and α‐syn forms, including in EVs, that, in turn, can spread in the CNS via systemic circulation (5). In parallel, enteric α‐syn can spread in the brain via nerve ascending pathways (6). Both hypothesized spreading mechanisms contribute to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the CNS. Abbreviations: α‐syn, alpha‐synunclein; CNS, central nervous system; ENS, enteric nervous system. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]",
        "Pathological α‐syn forms in the neuronal and non‐neuronal cells of the CNS have been found to induce neuronal degeneration and synaptic dysfunction through mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal impairment, and membrane disturbances as well as neurogenic/inflammatory responses, respectively, that can contribute to PD onset and progression. For instance, α‐syn accumulation in central immune/inflammatory cells, including microglia, can activate inflammatory signaling as well as promote T cell recruitment and maturation towards pro‐inflammatory phenotype by interfering with SNARE complexes, altering the trafficking of cell‐surface receptors, or interacting with TLRs and NLRP3 inflammasome (Figure 2) [67, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]. In parallel, intracellular pathological α‐syn can be also secreted in extracellular space and, in turn, activate neighboring neuronal and non‐neuronal cells, thus creating a cell microenvironment, that, continuously fed by α‐syn, contributes to the chronicization of the ongoing neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. Thus, α‐syn acts as a bridging element between neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Figure 3a) [71, 79, 80]. Indeed, clinical studies have documented concomitance of α‐syn inclusions, neuronal death, microgliosis, astrogliosis, and peripheral immune cell infiltration, mainly T cells (CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+ T cells) and monocytes, in PD post‐mortem brain sections [81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88]. However, these findings from post‐mortem patients do not establish a causal relationship between α‐syn pathology, microgliosis, astrogliosis, and immune/inflammatory cell infiltration and the clinical stage of PD.",
        "Studies performed in animal models have allowed to better understand the putative role of α‐syn as a bridging plug across neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in PD. A recent pioneering study performed in a mouse model with selective microglial‐α‐syn overexpression in the substantia nigra (CX3CR1‐SNCA mice) showed that α‐syn deposition in microglial cells induced selectively dopamine neuronal degeneration by promoting phagocytic exhaustion and the recruitment of peripheral immune/inflammatory cells [89]. In particular, the authors showed that α‐syn accumulation in microglia altered oxidative stress‐related genes, increasing intracellular and extracellular ROS levels and NO production with consequent neurotoxicity and dopamine neuronal cell loss [89]. In addition, glial‐derived pro‐inflammatory mediators, recruited peripheral adaptive immune cells (i.e., T cells, dendritic cells, and B cells) [89, 90]. They, once recruited, can be activated by microglial cells [91]. Such events trigger a vicious cycle, that further induces the recruitment of peripheral leukocytes and microglial neurotoxicity. In accordance, CX3CR1‐SNCA nigral tissues were found enriched in numerous populations of innate and adaptive immune cells, including CD8+ and CD4 Th1+ T and NK cells that originated in the periphery and infiltrated brain tissues contributing to neuroinflammation and ongoing neurodegenerative process [45, 89, 90, 92, 93]. These findings suggest that intra‐ and extracellular α‐syn deposition in brain tissues can represent an early event in PD that contributes to dopaminergic neuronal death and inflammation by recruitment of peripheral immune/inflammatory cells. In support of this view, different studies performed in α‐syn‐driven animal models of PD, including transgenic mice and rats injected with pre‐formed α‐syn fibrils into the striatum, reported that microgliosis preceded neuronal death and that, infiltrating CD8+ T and MHC‐II cells were in close proximity to neuronal and non‐neuronal cells overexpressing α‐syn (Figure 3a) [94, 95, 96].",
        "Regarding the astrocytes, an interesting study using human brain homogenates from PD patients reported that α‐syn is recruited and propagated from astrocytes to neurons, eliciting neural cell damage [97]. Supporting this view, a direct correlation between the pathological α‐syn accumulation in astrocytes and neurotoxicity has been shown using primary culture of astrocytes overexpressing α‐syn derived from A53T mice and from pluripotent stem cells from familial PD patients [98, 99]. In particular, pathological α‐syn promoted the polarization of astrocytes to neurotoxic A1 phenotype, leading to the release of ROS and pro‐inflammatory cytokines in the extracellular space (Figure 3a) [100]. Accordingly, Yun et al. [101], have demonstrated that the pharmacological blockage of astrocyte conversation to a neurotoxic A1 phenotype by NLY01 (glucagon‐like peptide agonist) in a mouse model of sporadic PD prevented central inflammation and neuronal death, prolonged survival and partially rescue of behavioral and neurological deficits.",
        "Of interest, the involvement of the gut‐brain axis in PD has fostered research on the characterization of the putative role of α‐syn accumulation in neuronal and non‐neuronal GI tract cells [102]. Using total and phospho‐α‐syn immunohistochemical staining, several independent neuropathology laboratories demonstrated that LBs and LNs‐like structures were observed in the enteric neurons in both the myenteric and submucosal plexus in the vast majority of PD patients [103, 104]. In addition, pathological α‐syn species, including aggregated [96], hyperphosphorylated [72], and truncated forms [97] with a seeding activity [105, 106] are found in the enteric neurons in PD, thereby recapitulating the key features of pathological α‐syn observed in the brain [36]. Of note, though physiological α‐syn has also been detected in ECs, there are no existing studies on the presence of pathological α‐syn deposits in the ECs in the gut of PD subjects.",
        "Of interest, enteric α‐syn accumulation can also promote neurogenic/immune‐inflammatory responses that, in turn, impair intestinal barrier integrity and permeability or directly decrease tight junction protein expression [86, 107, 108]. Increased intestinal permeability allows the passage of α‐syn, either free or enclosed in extracellular vesicles (EVs), along with toxins, bacteria, and other molecules, into the systemic circulation. This process can promote the spread of α‐syn to the brain and activate systemic immune‐inflammatory cells thereby contributing to PD pathology [109, 110]. Supporting this view, recent studies in transgenic PD mice demonstrated that enteric α‐syn accumulation, mainly in myenteric and submucosal neurons, bowel inflammation, and alterations of intestinal barrier integrity and permeability occurred in the presymptomatic stages of the disease before the onset of central pathology (Figure 3b) [107, 111]. However, whether α‐syn deposition occurred also in other GI cell types, including enteric glia, epithelial cells, and immune/inflammatory cells has not been evaluated and, most importantly, a direct and mutual relationship among α‐syn accumulation, enteric inflammation, gut barrier impairments, and PD pathology has not been established. Studies in vitro have demonstrated that α‐syn incubation in macrophages promoted the direct activation of canonical caspase‐1‐dependent inflammasome signaling and IL‐1β release, which, in turn, contributed to impaired intestinal epithelial barrier integrity [107].",
        "Of note, α‐syn can interact with gut microbiota, promoting changes in bacteria composition and function that could contribute to gut barrier alterations and enteric inflammation observed in PD [102]. In parallel, gut microbiota‐derived factors can influence α‐syn aggregation, thus generating a vicious circle that contributes to the progression of α‐syn pathology in the gut [102, 107, 112, 113]. However, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which α‐syn impacts gut cells is crucial for unraveling the link between α‐syn, GI symptoms and PD pathology.",
        "α‐Syn is constitutively expressed in the CNS, comprising 1% of total cytosolic proteins [114]. Previous immunohistochemical analysis in normal brain tissues showed that α‐syn is mainly localized in close proximity to presynaptic terminals, while neuronal soma staining is less apparent [115]. α‐Syn was also detected in the glial cytoplasm of human brains of healthy subjects [116]. Of note, the expression of α‐syn is influenced during neuronal development, following the determination of neuronal phenotype and in the establishment of synaptic connections [26]. Notably, physiological α‐syn was not detected in the primary visual and cerebellar cortex, regarded as brain areas not prone to develop α‐syn pathology [117]. Several previous studies have reported the presence of LBs in various sites of the CNS, including the hypothalamus, nucleus basalis of Meynert, substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, intermediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord, and sacral autonomic nucleus [58, 118, 119, 120, 121]. LBs are also detected in neurons of the amygdala and the cerebral cortex, particularly in deep layers (V and VI) of the limbic system [122, 123]. Of note, LBs formation has been found to advance in a caudal to rostral manner from the brainstem to the cortex over the course of the disease (Braak staging system) [58]. However, it's important to note that not all cases of α‐synucleinopathy reflect the proposed Braak staging system [124]. More recent comparative analyses of healthy and PD‐affected brains have revealed the presence of α‐syn aggregates [58, 123, 124, 125]. In addition, the study conducted by Beach et al. demonstrated a significant correlation between LBs and motor symptoms assessed by unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) scores, as well as cognitive function measured by mini‐mental state examination (MMSE) scores, particularly in subjects with smaller fractions of coexisting Alzheimer's disease pathology [126]. Others have also shown that the quantity of LBs in the frontal and/or limbic cortex serves as a better predictor of dementia in PD [127, 128, 129]. However, some studies have reported that around 10% of asymptomatic individuals over 60 years old exhibited extensive LB pathology without any signs of clinical parkinsonism [130, 131]. In addition, Zaccai et al. reported an α‐syn‐related pathology in aged individuals without a history of parkinsonism, suggesting no correlation between α‐syn deposition and PD progression [132]. These conflicting results about the accumulation of α‐syn in the brain of PD patients could depend on different clinical features of recruited patients (e.g., disease duration, motor/non‐motor symptoms).",
        "Two recent studies, aimed at evaluating α‐syn deposition in brain tissues from post‐mortem PD patients, have allowed us to better understand the spreading of pathological α‐syn in PD [133, 134]. In particular, the study from Borghammer et al. showed that α‐syn deposition in the olfactory bulb (OB) correlated with α‐syn accumulation in the amygdala, while PD patients with protein deposition in the brainstem or peripheral nervous system (PNS) showed less frequent α‐syn in OB. This pattern suggests two distinct origins of PD (PNS and OB), that rarely are involved simultaneously [133]. The other study from Lin et al. reported that microstructural alterations measured by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were associated with dopaminergic neuronal loss and LNs load in the SNpc, suggesting MRI as a suitable monitoring indicator for Lewy pathology [134].",
        "Of interest, research on genetic PD patients has provided valuable insights. In particular, some patients with the A53T mutation in the SNCA gene (a missense point mutation), exhibited diffuse α‐syn deposition associated with specific clinical features (Table 1) [135, 136, 137].",

        "Hairy skin is characterized by a complex autonomic innervation pattern, including sympathetic adrenergic and cholinergic fibers in all dermal structures, few parasympathetic fibers in skin arterioles, and arrector pili muscles and sensory nerves found in all autonomic structures involved in reflex regulation mechanisms [199]. Morphological analysis has shown that total α‐syn is constitutively expressed within the synaptic terminals in skin biopsies from healthy subjects. In particular, total α‐syn has been detected in sweat glands, arrector pilorum muscles, and blood vessels from control subjects [200].",
        "Using sampled skin from the chest and forearm of autopsied patients and an immunohistochemical approach, Ikemura et al. found LN in the sympathetic nerve fascicles of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue in 10 out of 14 PD patients [201]. These findings logically prompted several groups to study if the detection of pathological α‐syn by immunohistochemical means in the biopsied skin could be an interesting tool for the diagnosis of PD. Since 2010, more than 30 studies on this subject have been published, and detailing these studies one by one is definitely beyond the scope of the current review. However, the main findings of these studies can be summarized as follows: (i) Skin biopsies (performed at multiple sites and with optimized staining protocols) allow to detect α‐syn deposits and discriminate between PD and controls with acceptable sensitivity and an excellent specificity [202, 203]; (ii) skin biopsy of the cervical C7 paravertebral provide the best sensitivity for the detection of α‐syn deposits [204]; (iii) dermal α‐syn deposits is an early phenomenon as it can be observed in skin biopsies from patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) [205], a well‐established clinical non‐motor risk marker of PD. At first glance, all the above findings are rather convincing and strongly suggest that the detection of dermal pathological α‐syn can be used for the diagnosis of patients with either prodromal or overt PD. The interpretation of skin α‐syn staining is nevertheless delicate and alternative approaches to immunohistochemistry would be helpful. At present, the most promising approaches are based on ultrasensitive techniques such as protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) and real‐time quaking‐induced conversion (RT‐QuIC) assays, which have been recently shown to efficiently amplify small amounts of aggregated α‐syn in skin biopsies from iRBD subjects with excellent specificity and sensitivity (Table 2) [160, 206].",
        "Regarding the ENS, the presence of LBs and neurites in the GI tract was described almost 40 years ago in two seminal reports [207, 208]. Subsequently, Wakabayashi et al. found LBs in the GI tract of seven consecutive autopsies performed in PD patients [209], and more recently, Beach et al. reported LB and LN in the gut of 11 of 17 PD patients [104]. In both studies, Lewy pathology was distributed in both the myenteric and submucosal plexus from the upper esophagus to the rectum following a rostrocaudal gradient [104, 209]. Remarkably, when specific histochemical procedures were used (analysis of multiple slides of thick sections of the lower esophagus), α‐syn histopathology was found in 14 out of 15 PD patients, suggesting that the pathology is scattered but nearly constant in the ENS [104].",
        "As with the skin, the accessibility of the ENS has led many groups to study the presence of α‐syn deposits using routine GI biopsies. Most of the existing studies, which used immunohistochemical staining of formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded samples, have had conflicting results regarding sensitivity and specificity [210, 211]. An alternative approach with microdissection of the biopsies to perform whole‐mount immunostaining has provided interesting results in terms of specificity and sensitivity, but this approach can hardly be used routinely [212, 213]. Again, just like for skin biopsies, PMCA and real‐time quaking‐induced conversion RT‐QuIC assays might be helpful to efficiently amplify small amounts of aggregated α‐syn from GI biopsies in PD subjects (Table 3) [106].",
        "α‐Syn is physiologically expressed in the blood cells, including erythrocytes and platelets (more than 99%) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma (less than 1%) [214]. However, the quantity of α‐syn in the blood can be influenced by red blood cells contamination and hemolysis. Indeed, a low degree of contamination could result in a substantially increased concentration in plasma and serum of α‐syn [215].",
        "Over the last years, several studies have focused on the assessment of α‐syn deposition in the plasma, serum, and circulating EVs from PD patients, using different assays, including validated enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, single molecule arrays (SIMOA), Luminex assay, and immunomagnetic reduction assays or RT‐QuIC [173, 174, 182, 183, 198]. Most of the evidence has reported that total α‐syn is significantly increased in the plasma from PD patients when compared to healthy controls [172, 174, 177, 179, 181, 182, 183, 189, 190, 194, 196, 198], while others reported no differences or lower levels of circulating α‐syn in PD patients [173, 175, 176, 180, 187, 188, 193]. These conflicting findings could result from the employment of different assays, sample degradation, including hemolysis, and different clinical features of recruited patients, such as age, disease duration, and severity. However, most of recent studies have shown that the increased levels of α‐syn in the blood correlated with the severity of motor dysfunctions, poorer cognitive impairment, and with an increase in circulating inflammatory mediators [176, 181, 182, 186, 189, 190, 193].",
        "Of interest, several studies in PD patients have focused on the evaluation of α‐syn species in blood‐derived EVs, regarded as membrane particles of cellular origin that accumulate pathological α‐syn forms and promote its spreading among cells [215]. EVs, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, are produced by almost all cell types and can be released in several body fluids, including plasma, serum, urine, and CSF [216]. In the setting of PD, most studies have evaluated EVs‐derived α‐syn, including exosomes and microvesicles released by neurons, in the blood [192, 197, 215]. In particular, Shi et al. reported that plasma neural‐derived exosomes (L1 cell adhesion molecule‐containing exosomes) from PD patients contain higher α‐syn levels as compared with control subjects HC, and this pattern correlated with disease severity [179]. Jiang et al. showed that neuron‐derived exosomal α‐syn was increased in iRBD and early PD patients as compared to multiple system atrophy (MSA), other neurodegenerative diseases individuals and controls, suggesting that exosomal α‐syn accumulation precedes PD diagnosis, persists with disease progression and in combination with clusterin predicts and differentiates PD from atypical parkinsonism [185]. Likewise, Dutta et al. tested and validated blood‐based α‐syn concentrations in neuronal and oligodendroglial exosomes isolated from serum or plasma of controls, PD, and MSA patients, and they observed that the assessment of α‐syn in oligodendroglial‐derived exosomes can discriminate among PD, controls and MSA subjects [196]. Zou et al. showed that that the increase in EVs‐derived α‐syn correlated positively with EVs‐derived Linc‐POU3F3, a long noncoding RNA involved in the pathophysiological events in PD and, negatively with lysosomal enzyme β‐glucocerebrosidase (GCase), activity whom reduction is associated with PD severity [192]. Of interest, increased oligomeric α‐syn forms levels were detected in circulating neuronal exosomes derived from PD patients, and this pattern was found to be correlated with a decrease in SNARE proteins, including syntaxin‐1A (STX‐1A) and synaptobrevin2 (VAMP‐2), and with disease duration and severity [195, 197]. Increased α‐syn levels in plasma neuronal exosomes were detected in early PD patients compared with HCs, and this pattern correlated with UPDRS III/(I + II + III), Non‐Motor Symptoms Questionnaire, and Sniffin’ sticks 16 item test scores. After a mean follow‐up of 22 months in early PD patients, increased plasma α‐syn levels were found to be associated with a higher risk for motor symptom progression. No significant differences in exosomal α‐syn levels were observed among iRBD patients and control subjects [191]. Of interest, a recent study, assessing α‐syn levels in neuronal and non‐neuronal‐derived EVs from blood, revealed that the detection and amplification of pathological soluble α‐syn conformers in plasma neuronal EVs is highly promising as a reliable pre‐mortem biomarker for PD [80, 191]. These findings provide new insights for the development of a standardized, non‐invasive assay aimed at detecting pathology‐associated α‐syn extracted from blood. Only one study reported that circulating exosomes‐derived α‐syn is reduced in PD as compared to essential tremor patients and healthy subjects [217]. This discrepancy could depend on different methodological approaches, including the extraction of exosomes from blood and the method of quantification of α‐syn.",
        "Clinical evidence indicates that PD patients are characterized by α‐syn deposition in many regions of the CNS and in peripheral tissues, including skin, gut, blood, and circulating EVs. However, correlations between α‐syn accumulation with disease duration, severity, and motor and non‐motor symptoms are complex and variable. In particular, most studies in brain tissues seem to be quite dated, and, most importantly, since being from postmortem patients, they do not allow to understand α‐syn initial deposition, its spreading, and its role in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. The more recent studies aimed at evaluating α‐syn deposition in skin, gut, blood, and cirvulating EVs have better clarified the role of α‐syn pathology in PD. Indeed, increased α‐syn in the blood and plasma/serum EVs was found to correlate with PD severity and symptoms. In addition, an interesting study has shown that the increased circulating levels of α‐syn correlated with IL‐1β levels, suggesting that α‐syn could contribute to immune/inflammatory responses in PD. However, several issues remain to be clarified. For instance, the exact initiation and spreading of α‐syn pathology remains debated, and most importantly, evidence about the effects of pathological α‐syn forms in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes in PD needs to be further investigated. Moreover, it remains to be determined whether the evaluation of the initial localization of pathological α‐syn forms by several assays, including immunolabeling, RT‐QuIC, or validated ELISA kits, can represent a useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of PD. In this context, validated assays to evaluate α‐syn deposits in several tissues from PD patients still need to be implemented.",
        "The involvement of α‐syn in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration associated with PD is fostering research on the potential therapeutic benefits resulting from the direct or indirect pharmacological blockade of α‐syn. At present, several studies aimed at investigating the pharmacological role of α‐syn in PD, have been performed in in vivo and in vitro experimental models as well as in patients. In this section, the available preclinical and clinical studies testing the effects of the direct and indirect blockade of α‐syn are discussed and summarized in Tables 5 and 6.",

At present, five monoclonal antibodies (PRX002, BIIB054, ABVV‐0805, MEDI1341, LU AF82422) have been tested or are currently being evaluated in Phases 1–3 clinical trials in patients with synucleinopathies. The PRX002/prasinezumab (a humanized version of the C‐terminal antibody 9E4) and BIIB054/Cimpanemab (NI‐202, a fully human‐derived monoclonal antibody directed against the N‐terminal epitope of α‐syn) were recently evaluated in two similar multicenter, randomized, double‐blinded trials (the PASADENA—NCT03100149—and the SPARK study—NCT03318523—, respectively) [235, 243]. In these studies, early‐stage PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr stage < 3) with an abnormal dopamine transporter (DaT) scan have been recruited. In this trial, neither the primary nor secondary endpoints, represented by a reduction in the MDS‐UPDRS scale (Movement Disorder Society‐Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) total score and in DaT imaging over a 52‐week period, respectively, were met, except for a trend of slower motor progression with the lower dose of PRX002 in the PASADENA study that led to the launch of a Phase 2b study (PADOVA—NCT04777331) [235, 243, 244]. Another humanized monoclonal antibody tested in a clinical trial was ABBV‐0805 (BAN0805, selective for soluble aggregated α‐syn) has been discontinued for strategic reasons although reported a favorable tolerability profile (NCT04127695) [245]. Likewise, MEDI1341 (TAK‐341) and LU AF82422, both monoclonal antibodies targeting the C‐terminal of α‐syn [229], showed good tolerance in both healthy subject and PD patients in completed Phase 1 clinical trials (NCT03272165 and NCT04449484 for MEDI1341; NCT03611569 for LU AF82422) [246, 247].Active immunization approaches with synthetic peptides mimicking human α‐syn have also been tested in PD patients in Phase 1 clinical trials, and they have shown a good safety and tolerability profile [248, 249]. In particular, the vaccine UB‐312 is currently in Phase 1 clinical trial in PD patients (NCT05634876) [250, 251], but no data are currently available. The molecules Affitope PD01A and PD03A targeting α‐syn aggregates have shown to be safe, well‐tolerated and highly immunogenic in two Phase 1 trials conducted in early PD (NCT01568099 for PD01A and NCT02267434 for PD03A) [252, 253, 254]; thus, an optimized version of the vaccine PD01A, now called ACI‐7104, is entered into a Phase 2 trial (NCT06015841).ii.\nDecrease in α‐syn production. A Phase 1 trial (REASON, NCT03976349) is currently ongoing in patients with or without a PD‐related LRRK2 mutation treated with ASO intrathecal administration [255]. In particular, in this study, BIIB094 will be tested for its ability to reduce the LRRK2 expression and, consequently, the α‐syn fibril formation [255]. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the complete gene inactivation of α‐syn can trigger detrimental effects on neuronal and non‐neuronal cells; therefore, special attention is required to avoid an excessive reduction of physiological α‐syn levels [256]. An alternative approach to decrease α‐syn expression seeks to interfere with the transcription of α‐syn gene [257, 258, 259, 260]. In particular, Mittal et al. demonstrated that the activation of β2‐adrenoreceptors (β2‐AR) reduced SNCA expression by regulating α‐syn transcription, thus suggesting a potential neuroprotective effect of β2‐AR. In addition, the company CuraSen Therapeutics Inc. has reported positive results from a Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04739423) in patients with neurodegenerative conditions (PD with Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder or dementia, Dementia with LBs and Mild cognitive impairment) by using a combination of β2‐AR agonists: clenbuterol (CST‐103) and nadolol (CST‐107) [261].iii.\nInhibition of α‐syn aggregation and aggregate reduction. Recently, the brain‐penetrant molecule UCB0599 (minzasolmin), an enantiomer of NPT‐200‐11, moved into two Phase 1 studies (NCT05845645 and NCT04875962) to test safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile in healthy participants [262]. Based on the promising results, UCB0599 is underway in the Phase 2 clinical trials (NCT04658186 and NCT05543252). Another similar promising small molecule called Anle138b has reached the clinical state of development, completing Phase 1 trials in healthy participants (NCT04208152) and patients with mild to moderate PD (NCT04685265) [263].Of note, molecules able to target LRRK2 are emerging as a potential therapeutical strategy to reduce α‐syn pathology through the restoration of lysosomal functions [264]. In this regard, the selective LRRK2 inhibitor, DNL201, recently completed the Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04551534) and 1b studies (NCT03710707) showing a dose‐dependent impact on lysosomal function with an acceptable safety profile [265].iv.\nInhibiting c‐Abl activity. Nilotinib is able to inhibit c‐Abl (increased in PD patients) [266] and DDR1/2 (discoidin domain receptors), thus promoting autophagic clearance of pathological α‐syn [267]. Although preliminary studies showed acceptable safety and tolerability in PD patients along with favorable effects on CSF biomarkers, including brain dopamine turnover, oligomeric α‐syn, and hyperphosphorylated tau [268, 269], Nilotinib demonstrated poor penetration in the brain and no relevant symptomatic benefit on measures of disability in a successive multi‐dose placebo‐controlled Phase 2 study (NCT03205488) [270]; consequently, further clinical trial developments are currently lacking. Other Abl‐tyrosine kinase inhibitors with better CNS penetration (Radotinib, ikt‐148009 or Risvodetinib and Vodobatinib or K0706) are currently underway in Phase 2 multicentre trials (NCT04691661, NCT05424276, and NCT03655236, respectively).",

In particular, Mittal et al. demonstrated that the activation of β2‐adrenoreceptors (β2‐AR) reduced SNCA expression by regulating α‐syn transcription, thus suggesting a potential neuroprotective effect of β2‐AR. In addition, the company CuraSen Therapeutics Inc. has reported positive results from a Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04739423) in patients with neurodegenerative conditions (PD with Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder or dementia, Dementia with LBs and Mild cognitive impairment) by using a combination of β2‐AR agonists: clenbuterol (CST‐103) and nadolol (CST‐107) [261].",
        "Inhibition of α‐syn aggregation and aggregate reduction. Recently, the brain‐penetrant molecule UCB0599 (minzasolmin), an enantiomer of NPT‐200‐11, moved into two Phase 1 studies (NCT05845645 and NCT04875962) to test safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile in healthy participants [262]. Based on the promising results, UCB0599 is underway in the Phase 2 clinical trials (NCT04658186 and NCT05543252). Another similar promising small molecule called Anle138b has reached the clinical state of development, completing Phase 1 trials in healthy participants (NCT04208152) and patients with mild to moderate PD (NCT04685265) [263].",
        "Of note, molecules able to target LRRK2 are emerging as a potential therapeutical strategy to reduce α‐syn pathology through the restoration of lysosomal functions [264]. In this regard, the selective LRRK2 inhibitor, DNL201, recently completed the Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04551534) and 1b studies (NCT03710707) showing a dose‐dependent impact on lysosomal function with an acceptable safety profile [265].",
        "Inhibiting c‐Abl activity. Nilotinib is able to inhibit c‐Abl (increased in PD patients) [266] and DDR1/2 (discoidin domain receptors), thus promoting autophagic clearance of pathological α‐syn [267]. Although preliminary studies showed acceptable safety and tolerability in PD patients along with favorable effects on CSF biomarkers, including brain dopamine turnover, oligomeric α‐syn, and hyperphosphorylated tau [268, 269], Nilotinib demonstrated poor penetration in the brain and no relevant symptomatic benefit on measures of disability in a successive multi‐dose placebo‐controlled Phase 2 study (NCT03205488) [270]; consequently, further clinical trial developments are currently lacking. Other Abl‐tyrosine kinase inhibitors with better CNS penetration (Radotinib, ikt‐148009 or Risvodetinib and Vodobatinib or K0706) are currently underway in Phase 2 multicentre trials (NCT04691661, NCT05424276, and NCT03655236, respectively).",
        "Pre‐clinical studies targeting directly or indirectly pathological α‐syn have provided promising results. Among them, immunotherapy and small molecules able to dissociate α‐syn aggregates have raised a significant interest as potential therapeutical approaches to halt or slow down the progression of PD. Unfortunately, the results deriving from clinical trials have not shown promising results as compared to the pre‐clinical ones. Indeed, most drugs targeting α‐syn have been found to be safe and well tolerated, they have shown poor efficacy in halting or slowing down PD progression as well as in alleviating motor and non‐motor symptoms. Encouraging results have emerged only from the PASADENA trial, showing a trend of slower motor progression in early PD patients that led to the launch of a Phase 2b study.",
        "In summary, based on current findings, some important issues remain to be discussed: (1) the degeneration of nigral neurons can occur before α‐syn deposition, and, most importantly, it remains controversial the timing of α‐syn accumulation in the pathogenic cascade of PD; (2) the physiological functions of α‐syn in neuronal and non‐neuronal cells as well as the exact nature of disease‐relevant species (e.g., oligomers vs fibrils) needs still to be clarified; (3) the recruitment of PD patients, since most of the clinical trials include early symptomatic PD patients with already advanced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration; (4) poor blood–brain barrier penetration of drugs; (5) α‐syn targeting approaches may require time to produce any observable effects. Based on these considerations, in vivo markers of α‐syn pathology in humans able to measure target engagement should be identified. In addition, clinical studies in very early patients with a high risk of developing PD, including iRBD subjects, and the presence of pathological α‐syn deposition in gut, skin, or blood should be performed to clarify whether targeting α‐syn can represent the best pharmacological strategy for the treatment of PD.",
        "Several studies have shown that pathological α‐syn forms in the brain and in the gut can accumulate in neuronal and non‐neuronal cells and induce neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammatory responses, respectively. In parallel, pathological α‐syn can be secreted in extracellular space and, in turn, it can activate neighboring neuronal and non‐neuronal cells as well as recruit peripheral immune/inflammatory cells [271], thus creating a sort of vicious circle that contributes to the ongoing neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. In this setting, it is conceivable that α‐syn acts as a bridging plug across central and systemic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in PD. However, the pathological forms of α‐syn mainly involved in α‐syn spreading and PD pathology remain to be clarified. Available data from clinical studies, though suggest that the evaluation of α‐syn especially in the blood and circulating EVs can represent a biomarker of PD, in terms of disease severity and symptoms and systemic inflammation, but does not allow to establish the causal relationship between α‐syn and brain pathology and, most importantly, whether its accumulation precedes or represents a mere consequence of PD.",
        "Regarding its pharmacological relevance, α‐syn could indeed represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of PD. However, the clinical trials conducted so far have mostly recruited patients already diagnosed with PD, where neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory processes have likely already been triggered, potentially impacting the effectiveness of such targeted therapies.",
        "Thus, further clinical and experimental studies in humans, including early, iRBD, non‐movement disorder PD patients, and in animal models are needed to better clarify the pathophysiological and pharmacological role of α‐syn deposition in PD onset and progression as well as its relevance as diagnostic or prognostic marker of PD.",

    "title": "Microglia-specific IL-10 gene delivery inhibits neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it remains unresolved how to effectively normalize this immune response given the complex interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses occurring within a scarcely accessible organ like the brain. In this study, we uncovered a consistent correlation between neuroinflammation, brain parenchymal lymphocytes, and DAN loss among several commonly used mouse models of PD generated by a variety of pathological triggers. We validated a viral therapeutic approach for the microglia-specific expression of interleukin 10 (IL-10) to selectively mitigate the excessive inflammatory response. We found that this approach induced a local nigral IL-10 release that alleviated DAN loss in mice overexpressing the human SNCA gene in the substantia nigra. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that IL-10 induced the emergence of a molecularly distinct microglial cell state, enriched in markers of cell activation with enhanced expression of prophagocytic pathways. IL-10 promoted microglial phagocytotic and clearance activities in vitro and reduced alphaSYN aggregate burden in the nigral area in mice overexpressing SNCA. Furthermore, IL-10 stimulated the differentiation of CD4(+) T lymphocytes into active T regulatory cells and promoted inhibitory characteristics in CD8(+) T cells. In summary, our results show that local and microglia-specific IL-10 transduction elicited strong immunomodulation in the nigral tissue with enhanced suppression of lymphocyte toxicity that was associated with DAN survival. These results offer insights into the therapeutic benefits of IL-10 and showcase a promising gene delivery approach that could minimize undesired side effects.

        "GDNF, the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, is a neurotrophic factor involved in fundamental physiological processes in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery. GDNF can elicit a variety of cellular responses, involved in several key processes, including neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth, and synaptogenesis. Beyond its role in development, GDNF exerts a significant neuroprotective role in different pathophysiological conditions, including neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, but also some psychiatric disorders and addiction. The clinical potential of GDNF has been evident since its discovery in the nineties, nonetheless, the possibility to exploit this molecule in therapy has not yet fulfilled its promise. Indeed, the lack of knowledge of certain aspects of GDNF biology has slowed the progress of GDNF-based therapies. In this review, we focused on a wide assessment of the current knowledge about GDNF and its role in different physiological processes, highlighting the therapeutic opportunities arising from this knowledge.",
        "The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor belongs to the GDNF family ligands (GFLs), which also include persephin, neurturin, and artemin (Airaksinen and Saarma, 2002). In physiological conditions, GDNF is expressed in soft tissue, testis, kidney, adrenal gland, parathyroid gland, placenta, gastrointestinal tract, spinal cord, and in different areas of the brain (The Human Protein Atlas - https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000168621-GDNF/tissue). Neurotrophic factors are proteins that support neuronal survival, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Additionally, they function as neurocytokines, facilitating communication between neurons and target tissues. GFLs members exert their function through binding as homodimers to the tyrosine kinase receptor Rearranged during Transfection (RET). In turn, RET activation occurs only if the GFL is bound to a member of the GDNF-family receptor-α (GFRα) receptors, which are anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linker, lacking transmembrane and intracellular domains (Airaksinen and Saarma, 2002). The intracellular pathways activated by all GFLs play a crucial role in promoting neuronal development and survival. Moreover, GDNF was initially isolated from rat glial cell lines and identified as a neurotrophic factor able to enhance dopamine uptake in midbrain dopaminergic neurons (Lin et al., 1993). The neuroprotective effect of GDNF has attracted significant interest from the scientific community for its potential use in treating neurodegenerative diseases (see below).",
        "The human GDNF gene is located on chromosome 5 (5p13.2), it is 12 kb-long and consists of six exons. An alternative splicing occurring at the level of the third exon gives rise to two conserved alternative isoforms: a full-length transcript, the pre-α-pro-GDNF, and a shorter version of the transcript, lacking 78 bp in the sequence encoding the pro region, named pre-β-pro-GDNF (Schaar et al., 1994; Cristina et al., 1995). This results in a 26 amino-acid difference in the pro region of the pre- α-pro-GDNF and pre- β-pro-GDNF (Figure 1 – upper panel). Both isoforms, however, lead to the same 134 amino-acid-long mature GDNF protein, since the proteolytic cleavage site that is crucial to obtain the mature protein is encoded in exon II, which is not affected by the alternative splicing (Cristina et al., 1995). The protein maturation process starts soon after synthesis, with the pre-sequence-mediated localization of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein folds, disulfide (S-S) bonds are formed, and dimerization occurs. GDNF is also modified by N-linked glycosylation. After that, GDNF undergoes proteolytic processing into its mature form. The proteases that are involved in the processing of pro-GDNF to mature GDNF are furin, PACE4, and the following protein convertases: PC5A, PC5B, and PC7 (Lonka-Nevalaita et al., 2010). From a structural point of view, GDNF is characterized by a topological knot formed by three cysteines (Eigenbrot and Gerber, 1997), which makes it a distant member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family. GDNF features two finger-like structures that play a role in its interaction with GFRα. The site where the protein undergoes post-translational modification through N-glycosylation is situated near one of these finger-like structures. Although this modification is not critical for receptor binding and activation, it is necessary for the proper folding and processing of GDNF in mammalian cells (Piccinini et al., 2013).",
        "Schematic representation of GDNF splicing isoforms (A) and signaling pathways. Adapted from (Penttinen et al., 2018, Front. Neurol., CC BY 4.0).",
        "GDNF is a secreted protein, synthesized as a precursor protein (pre-pro-GDNF). Both the presence of the pro-domain and of the cysteine residues are important for secretion, that is strongly reduced in their absence (Oh-hashi et al., 2009; Piccinini et al., 2013). As mentioned before, in humans and rodents, GDNF is present in two splice isoforms, the pre-α-pro-GDNF and pre-β-pro-GDNF, that differ for a 26 amino-acid deletion in the pro domain of the β isoform. A study conducted in PC-6.3 cells showed distinct subcellular localizations for these two isoforms under normal conditions and after neuronal stimulation (Lonka-Nevalaita et al., 2010). Pre-α-pro-GDNF is primarily found in the Golgi complex and gradually progresses through the secretory pathway after stimulation. On the other hand, pre-β-pro-GDNF is mainly located in secretory vesicles and moves more quickly through the secretory pathway upon stimulation. The presence of both the α and β isoforms in secretory granules is confirmed by the co-localisation with the Rab3A and Rab27A markers. However, only pre-β-pro-GDNF shows strong co-localization with Secretogranin II, indicating its presence in the vesicles of the regulated secretory pathway, whereas pre-α-pro-GDNF shows less co-localization. Additionally, upon stimulation with potassium chloride, only the secretion of the mature GDNF form derived from the β precursor protein is increased (Lonka-Nevalaita et al., 2010). A potential reason for the difference between pre-α-pro-GDNF and pre-β-pro-GDNF could be that pre-α-pro-GDNF is less efficiently sorted into secretory granules at the trans-Golgi network, accounting for the higher presence of the α precursor in the Golgi region. Due to this inefficient sorting, some pre-α-pro-GDNF may also enter the constitutive secretion pathway.",
        "As previously mentioned, GFLs exert their trophic action through the activation of the RET receptor, but this interaction requires the presence of the co-receptor GFRα. Notably, there are four GFRα proteins capable of interacting with GFLs: GFRα1, GFRα2, GFRα3, and GFRα4, with GDNF binding preferentially to GFRα1 and with lower affinity to GFRα2, as demonstrated in mice studies (Cacalano et al., 1998). GDNF acts as a homodimer, stabilized by the formation of a disulfide bond. The GDNF-GFRα1 complex increases the affinity for the RET receptor and once bound, it triggers the dimerization of the RET receptor and the transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in its intracellular portion, thereby activating intracellular signaling. Like other tyrosine-kinase receptors, the outcome of the GDNF-GFRα1-RET interaction is the engagement of signaling effectors that include the Ras/MAP kinase, PI3 kinase/AKT, and phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) pathways (Ibanez, 2013).",
        "Focusing on the subcellular organization of this interaction, GFRα1 is located on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via the GPI anchor, residing in detergent-insoluble, sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts (Tansey et al., 2000; Paratcha et al., 2001). In the context of GDNF signaling, it has been observed that, for efficient downstream signaling and maximal GDNF-mediated bioactivity, RET must be recruited to these lipid rafts by GFRα1. Additionally, activated RET interacts with Src family kynases (SFKs) only when it is localized within these microdomains (Tansey et al., 2000). In the absence of SFKs recruitment, a decrease in the activation of AKT and MAPK pathways is observed, highlighting the crucial role of Src activity for optimal GDNF-mediated neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth (Encinas et al., 2001). The intensity of RET engagement by GDNF can then be modulated by its localization inside or outside lipid rafts, as well as by the ability of GFRα to function in soluble form, the so-called “trans” signaling (Tansey et al., 2000; Paratcha et al., 2001).",
        "The observation that GDNF and GFRα are widely expressed even in the absence of co-expressed RET suggests that the neurotrophic factor might exert its functions through alternative, RET-independent signaling systems (Trupp et al., 1997). GDNF can indeed interact with the Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM), a cell surface glycoprotein crucial for neural development and plasticity. NCAM plays a key role in cell-cell adhesion, neuron growth, and migration during brain development. In addition to its ability to facilitate cellular interaction, NCAM, in conjunction with GFRα receptors, has been found to act as a RET-independent signaling receptor for GFLs. This interaction helps to explain the tissue distribution of GFRα proteins. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that GFRα can form a complex with NCAM, particularly with the p140NCAM isoform, at the cell surface. This interaction results in enhanced binding of GDNF and reduced homophilic interactions between NCAM molecules (Paratcha et al., 2003). The binding of GDNF activates Src-like kinase Fyn and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the cytoplasm, ultimately stimulating Schwann cell migration and promoting axonal growth in hippocampal and cortical neurons (Paratcha et al., 2003). GDNF can also act independently of both RET and NCAM. During development, GDNF and GFRα promote the differentiation of ventral precursors into GABAergic cells, enhancing their neuronal morphology and motility–see below (Pozas and Ibáñez, 2005). Moreover, all GFLs except persephin, when immobilized and bound to the extracellular matrix, interact with a transmembrane heparan sulphate proteoglycan named Syndecan-3. The interaction between GFLs and Syndecan-3 causes the activation of Src kinase and is crucial for promoting neurite outgrowth and cell spreading. Specifically, the GDNF-syndecan-3 interaction enhances the migration of cortical neurons (Bespalov et al., 2011). GDNF signaling pathways are summarized in Figure 1 – lower panel.",
        "GDNF is extensively distributed across both the CNS and peripheral tissues. In either physiological or pathological conditions, it can be produced and secreted by a variety of cell types, including neurons, glial cells such as astrocytes, Schwann cells, and oligodendrocytes, as well as by motor neurons and skeletal muscle cells (Henderson et al., 1994). Additionally, GDNF signaling is involved in the normal development and shaping of the ureteric bud in the kidneys, and it is also secreted by Sertoli cells within the testis, playing a role in self-renewal and proliferation of spermatogonial stem cell (Costantini, 2010). The crucial role of GDNF signaling in development is highlighted by the fact that mice deficient in RET, GDNF, or GFRα do not survive after birth, displaying kidney agenesis and a lack of many parasympathetic and enteric neurons. While mice lacking other GFLs or co-receptors are viable and fertile, the ones missing NRTN or GFRα2 show similar deficits in enteric and parasympathetic innervation.",
        "GDNF expression increases during embryonic development of the CNS, decreasing instead in adulthood, when it remains restricted to specific brain areas such as the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, Substantia nigra, thalamus, cerebellum, and spinal cord (Hellmich et al., 1996; Mogi et al., 2001).",
        "Since its initial isolation, GDNF has been regarded as a potential therapeutic neurotrophic factor playing a role in the development of Substantia nigra (SN) Dopaminergic (DA) neurons (Lin et al., 1993). In spite of its name, GDNF is not physiologically expressed in glial cells of the murine nervous system, but rather in neurons, particularly in parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, cholinergic and somatostatin-positive interneurons in the striatum, as demonstrated in transgenic mice with the lacZ cassette at the GDNF locus (Pascual et al., 2008; Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 2012; Hidalgo-Figueroa et al., 2012). The pre-α-pro-GDNF isoform appears to be the predominant isoform in the dopaminergic system, particularly in the striatum and substantia nigra (Airavaara et al., 2011). In healthy adult human brains, GDNF mRNA levels are typically low; however, they have been found to increase under pathological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, not only in neurons but also in astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages (Nakagawa et al., 2005; Bäckman et al., 2006; Azevedo et al., 2020).",
        "GDNF principal receptors, GFRα1 and RET, mRNA and protein have been found to be expressed in rodent midbrain DA neurons from early embryonic development through to adulthood (Trupp et al., 1997; Golden et al., 1999; Airaksinen and Saarma, 2002). Several studies on rodent models have investigated the role of GDNF, GFRα1, and RET in the midbrain dopaminergic system. In rat and mouse models of Parkinson’s disease, a transient increase followed by a decline in GFRα1 and RET mRNA levels was observed in the substantia nigra after 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) exposure (Marco et al., 2002). A similar reduction in RET receptor levels was reported in the striatum following 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment (Hirata and Kiuchi, 2007), with both studies linking decreased GFRα1 and RET expression to the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and their diminished innervation of the striatum (Hirata and Kiuchi, 2007). GDNF injection during the postnatal period has been shown to have a protective effect on the survival of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic neurons, while transgenic models overexpressing GDNF exhibit increased dopamine levels and striatal innervation (Burke, 2004; Kumar et al., 2015). However, GDNF and GFRα1 knockout mice die shortly after birth without evident alterations in the dopaminergic system. In contrast, RET deficiency leads to a progressive loss of SN dopaminergic neurons in aging mice (Kramer et al., 2007). Moreover, in a recently published study, the disruption of the gdnf gene in zebrafish embryos, utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, resulted in a significant reduction (∼20%) of dopaminergic neurons in specific diencephalic clusters. This decrease was associated with altered expression of key transcription factors, including otpb and lmx1b.1, which are critical for dopaminergic neuron differentiation. Additionally, gdnf-deficient zebrafish exhibited impaired locomotor activity at 7 days post-fertilization and increased susceptibility to neurotoxic insults. These findings suggest that GDNF plays a conserved and essential role in the early development and functional maintenance of dopaminergic neurons (Wong et al., 2021). On the other hand, constitutive RET activation caused by a missense Meth918Thr mutation in the receptor results in an increased number of dopaminergic neurons in the SN and greater resistance to neurotoxins such as MPTP and 6-OHDA (Mijatovic et al., 2011). Moreover, conditional deletion studies of GDNF and RET have produced conflicting results regarding their necessity for neuronal survival in adulthood, suggesting the presence of compensatory mechanisms or alternative ligands (Pascual et al., 2008; Kopra et al., 2017). Several questions remain open, including the identity of the essential ligand for RET in the midbrain and the intracellular signaling pathways involved in neuronal survival.",
        "GDNF and its receptors, GFRα1 and NCAM, are expressed in hippocampal neurons during embryonic and early postnatal development, with GFRa1 localized at both pre- and post-synaptic sites, while NCAM is restricted to presynaptic terminals (Ledda, 2007). In hippocampal neuron cultures, GDNF enhances synapse formation, and the interaction of GFRα1-coated beads with neurons in the presence of soluble GDNF can induce ectopic presynaptic sites, demonstrating an instructive role of GDNF/GFRα1 signaling in synaptogenesis (Ledda, 2007), a process that partially relies on NCAM at presynaptic terminals. In vivo, mutant mice with reduced GDNF levels exhibit impaired presynaptic maturation and a decreased number of presynaptic sites during hippocampal development, further supporting the role of GDNF in synaptic assembly (Bonafina et al., 2019). Furthermore, utilizing crystallography and electron microscopy, it has been identified a decameric assembly comprising two GFRα1 pentamers bridged by five GDNF dimers. This configuration facilitates synaptic adhesion by forming complexes that bridge adjacent cell membranes. Further experiments demonstrated that the presence of the RET receptor and heparan sulfate can inhibit the formation of this adhesion complex by competing for the same binding interfaces (Bonafina et al., 2019). These findings suggest a dual role for GFRα1: promoting synaptic adhesion independently of RET and engaging in RET-mediated trophic signaling. This dual functionality provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal connectivity and the modulation of synaptic structures (Bonafina et al., 2019).",
        "Additionally, GDNF/GFRα1 signaling is critical for the structural and functional integration of adult-born granule cells into preexisting hippocampal circuits. Conditional GFRα1 knockout mice display deficits in behavioural pattern separation, a function linked to adult neurogenesis. Notably, physical activity enhances GDNF expression in the dentate gyrus, promoting GFRα1-dependent CREB activation and dendritic maturation. These findings highlight GDNF/GFRα1 signaling as a key regulator of both developmental and adult hippocampal plasticity, orchestrating synaptogenesis and the incorporation of new neurons into functional circuits (Bonafina et al., 2019). Recently, it has also been demonstrated that elevated levels of GDNF enhance GABAergic inhibitory inputs onto pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Mikroulis et al., 2022). This effect is mediated through the activation of the RET receptor pathway, facilitated by the co-receptor GFRα1. Notably, the other GDNF receptors, namely as NCAM or Syndecan3, are not implicated in this process. The study also demonstrated similar enhancements in inhibitory synaptic transmission in human hippocampal slices obtained from epilepsy patients. These findings suggest that GDNF’s ability to strengthen inhibitory signaling may contribute to its observed seizure-suppressant effects in various epilepsy models (Paolone et al., 2019; Wahlberg et al., 2020; Mikroulis et al., 2022).",
        "Recent research has revealed significant interactions of GDNF with the serotonergic (5-HT) system. Serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei express GDNF receptors, particularly GFRα1 and RET, suggesting direct responsiveness to GDNF (Okaty et al., 2015; 2020; Huang et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2019). The effect of GDNF on the brain 5-HT system is controversial, with some studies showing positive effects on brain 5-HT (Pertusa et al., 2008; Naumenko et al., 2013), and others reporting little or no effect (Hudson et al., 1995; Mijatovic et al., 2007). On the other hand, serotonin increases GDNF expression and secretion from C6 rat glioma cells, acting predominantly via 5-HT2A receptors (Hisaoka et al., 2004; Tsuchioka et al., 2008). While moderate increases in GDNF enhance serotonin neuron number, serotonergic gene expression, and 5-HT levels, excessive GDNF leads to a decrease in serotonergic neurons differentiation (Menegola et al., 2004). This nonlinear relationship may explain previous conflicting reports on GDNF’s effects on the serotonergic system.",
        "Human data with antidepressants provide indirect evidence of a connection between GDNF and the serotonergic system. Acute or chronic administration of antidepressants increasing the levels of synaptic serotonin (such as tricyclic antidepressants, tetracyclic antidepressants, and serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors) is indeed able to increase GDNF expression both in cell culture (Mercier et al., 2004; Hisaoka et al., 2007; Golan et al., 2011; Kajitani et al., 2012; Hisaoka-Nakashima et al., 2015; 2019; Abe et al., 2019) and in serum of patients with depression (Zhang et al., 2008). Preclinical data show that animals exposed to chronic unpredictable stress exhibit depression-like behavior and decreased GDNF expression in the hippocampus, that is reverted by chronic tricyclic antidepressant treatment (Uchida et al., 2011; Liu Q. et al., 2012). In addition, GDNF may be decreased in the peripheral blood of patients with major depressive disorder (Takebayashi et al., 2006; Lin and Tseng, 2015; Sharma et al., 2016).",
        "These findings suggest that the modulation of GDNF production may be a component of the therapeutic effect of antidepressants and that the fine-tuning of the serotonergic system by GDNF could be implied in the mechanisms of development of neuropsychiatric disorders. This nuanced relationship positions GDNF as a key neurotrophic factor beyond its classical dopaminergic role, critically involved in serotonergic system regulation (Popova et al., 2017).",
        "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) plays a multifaceted role in neurogenesis, influencing neural progenitor proliferation, migration, and differentiation across developmental and adult stages. GDNF has been recognized as a chemoattractant and differentiation signal for neuronal precursors, particularly in the subventricular zone and rostral migratory stream (Paratcha et al., 2006), where it modulates key signaling pathways, including RET/GFRα1 and PI3K/Akt, enhancing neurogenic output and synaptic integration (Airaksinen and Saarma, 2002).",
        "In the forebrain, inhibitory GABAergic interneurons originate in the ventral telencephalon and migrate tangentially to reach the developing cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb (Bartolini et al., 2013). The ganglionic eminences serve as temporary neurogenic regions, with the medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE and CGE) generating most cortical GABAergic neurons, whereas the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) primarily contributes interneurons to the olfactory bulb. Both GDNF and its co-receptor GFRα1 are expressed in the MGE and along the migratory routes of GABAergic neurons (Pozas and Ibáñez, 2005), where GDNF facilitates differentiation and functions as a chemoattractant (Pozas and Ibáñez, 2005; Paratcha et al., 2006). These effects depend on GFRα1 but not on NCAM or RET, and the addition of soluble GFRα1 to MGE cultures enhances differentiation and migration even in cells lacking endogenous GFRα1 (Perrinjaquet et al., 2011). Moreover, syndecan-3 has been proposed as an alternative GDNF receptor in MGE-derived GABAergic neurons, independently of GFRα1 (Bespalov et al., 2011). Mice deficient in GFRα1 exhibit reduced migration of GABAergic neurons, leading to a lower number of inhibitory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus at birth (Pozas and Ibáñez, 2005), as well as disrupted integration of parvalbumin-expressing neurons and altered social behaviors linked to increased cortical excitability (Canty et al., 2009), a phenomenon consistent with certain autism models (Tabuchi et al., 2007). GFRα1 signaling is also crucial for olfactory system development, as its loss results in deficits in multiple GABAergic interneuron populations in the olfactory bulb, along with impairments in neurogenesis, migration, and sensory axon growth (Marks et al., 2012).",
        "In stroke models, direct GDNF infusion significantly increases neurogenesis in the striatum (Kobayashi et al., 2006), while in the hippocampus, GDNF and its receptor GFRα1 are essential for proper integration of adult-born granule neurons (Bonafina et al., 2019). Following ischemia and traumatic brain injury, expression of various growth factors is increased and modulates neurogenesis, NSPC biology, and striatum connectivity (Christie and Turnley, 2013; Bacigaluppi et al., 2020; Butti et al., 2022). More recently, the neurogenic efficacy of GDNF has been harnessed through biomaterial-based delivery systems that enhance spinal cord repair and remyelination (Liu et al., 2024). Transplanting mesenchymal stem cells engineered to overexpress GDNF significantly improves neuroregenerative outcomes following ischemic or traumatic injury (Salgado et al., 2015; Chiavellini et al., 2022). This therapeutic strategy offers promising avenues in treating neurodegenerative disorders highlighting GDNF not only as a neuroprotective factor but also as a potent pro-neurogenic agent with promising translational potential in regenerative therapies.",
        "Neuroplasticity, the ability of the central nervous system to promote neurogenesis and renew connections, is influenced by different psychological, environmental and physiological factors, often involving the synthesis and secretion of neurotrophins (Kempermann et al., 2018).",
        "For example, several recent studies highlight that engaging in regular physical exercise, whether aerobic or strength-based, can enhance cognitive function and promote neuroplasticity through different mechanisms (De Sousa Fernandes et al., 2020). Aerobic exercise primarily boosts glutamatergic signaling and neurotrophic factors like BDNF and CREB, while resistance training engages pathways involving PKCα and inflammatory cytokines, while it has been shown that both kinds of exercise share as a common outcome the upregulation of GDNF in plantaris myofibers (Gyorkos and Spitsbergen, 2014; Rabelo et al., 2017; Vilela et al., 2017). GDNF likely plays a central role in mediating the cognitive benefits of exercise by promoting hippocampal remodelling and resilience to age-related neural decline (Vilela et al., 2017). In young adult mice, voluntary exercise increases levels of GDNF and BDNF in the dentate gyrus (DG) (Cotman and Berchtold, 2002; Farmer et al., 2004). This upregulation correlates with enhanced dendritic growth and complexity in newly generated granule cells, suggesting a role for these factors in mediating activity-dependent neuronal integration. Notably, the effects of exercise on granule cells maturation seems to be dependent on GFRα1, the co-receptor for GDNF. Mechanistically, GDNF/GFRα1 signaling may act through the activation of the transcription factor CREB, which is known to regulate activity-dependent dendritic development (Jagasia et al., 2009). In vitro stimulation of DG-derived neural stem cell cultures with GDNF lead to phosphorylation of both CREB and Erk1/2, confirming that GDNF directly activates this signaling cascade in differentiating neurons (Bonafina et al., 2019).",
        "As discussed above, GDNF is almost exclusively expressed by neurons in physiological conditions in the CNS (Pochon et al., 1997; Hidalgo-Figueroa et al., 2012), although its transcript can also be found in other cell types (Schaar et al., 1994). However, in various diseases, its expression in the brain changes over time, and other cell populations may become new reservoirs of GDNF production. Thus, in the following section, we will focus on the role of glia-derived GDNF.",
        "A growing body of evidence is pointing at a fundamental role of astrocyte-derived GDNF, which contributes to neuroprotection by modulating synaptic function, reducing oxidative stress, and promoting neuronal survival. Studies on primary astrocytic culture highlighted that inflammatory stimuli distinctly regulate GDNF and Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) in rodent astrocytes and microglia, with LPS treatment significantly increasing GDNF expression in astrocytes (Bresjanac and Antauer, 2000; Iravani et al., 2012; Kronenberg et al., 2019; Merienne et al., 2019). However, inflammatory stimuli are not the only ones able to impact GDNF expression. In an in vitro model of ischemia, utilizing neuron-glia and astrocyte cortical cultures subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation, astrocyte-GDNF emerged as one of the released factors that mediated neuroprotection, elicited by high-frequency repetitive magnetic stimulation (Gava-Junior et al., 2023). Cinnamon and its metabolite sodium benzoate (NaB) can upregulate GDNF in human astrocytes. Oral administration of NaB and cinnamon increased astrocytic expression of GDNF in a model of PD in vivo, conferring neuroprotection of TH neurons of the Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta. However, this effect was absent in astrocyte-specific GDNF knockout mice (GDNF∆astro) (Patel et al., 2019). In another PD model, Gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug approved by the FDA, has been shown to stimulate astrocytic GDNF, protecting dopaminergic neurons, through a PPARα-dependent pathway. Interestingly, Gemfibrozil was not effective in GDNF∆astro mice lacking GDNF, specifically in astrocytes (Gottschalk et al., 2021). Reactive astrocytes in Parkinson’s disease models also exhibit neurotrophic functions, with Nestin-positive astrocytes expressing GDNF (Chen et al., 2006). Furthermore, astrocytic GDNF mitigates cognitive decline post-anesthesia by improving hippocampal synaptic plasticity (Lin et al., 2024).",
        "Conversely, exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), an environmental endocrine-disrupting compound used in food packages, medical devices, office supplies, and children’s toys, reduces the secretion of GDNF, interfering with the estrogen pathway, by downregulating the ERK/c-fos signaling in astrocytes (Wang et al., 2021). Excessive GDNF levels have been linked to astrocyte proliferation and potential gliomagenesis via the GFRα1/RET/MAPK/pCREB/LOXL2 axis (Wang et al., 2022). Finally, chronic overexpression of GDNF in brain astrocytes in a transgenic mouse model appears to have a detrimental influence on nigrostriatal dopamine metabolism and neurotransmission (Sotoyama et al., 2017).",
        "GDNF produced by activated microglia and macrophages can aid in the repair of CNS injuries. In a model of spinal cord injury, LPS-induced macrophage activation enhanced GDNF expression at lesion sites, promoting functional recovery of the spinal cord by sustaining a neurotrophic environment, while mitigating oxidative stress (Hashimoto et al., 2005). GDNF mRNA was also upregulated a few hours post-injury, in a model of mechanical injury in the mouse striatum, with brain macrophages as the primary source, establishing a critical link between GDNF expression and dopaminergic neuron protection (Liberatore et al., 1997). Microglia, which persist long after injury, contribute significantly to neurotrophic support, predominantly secreting GDNF and BDNF. This immune-mediated neurotrophic environment facilitates dopaminergic axonal sprouting and tissue repair, particularly in neurodegenerative contexts such as PD (Batchelor et al., 1999; 2002). Notably, sprouting dopaminergic fibers associate closely with neurotrophic factor-expressing microglia, exploiting them as structural support to navigate toward lesion edges (Batchelor et al., 2002). NG2-positive and Iba1-positive cells in the substantia nigra express GDNF and it has been shown that they are localized close to surviving TH-positive neurons in the Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta, suggesting a neuroprotective role for these cells in dopaminergic neuron survival (Kitamura et al., 2010). Moreover, experiments on BV2 cells have shown that GDNF exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by decreasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-1β, and IL-12β in a model of inflammation induced by amyloid beta. This study highlights the involvement of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway in this process (Qing et al., 2020). These findings collectively highlight the interplay between immune cells and neurotrophic factors in CNS repair.",
        "GDNF has long been recognized for its pivotal role in promoting axonal growth and neuronal regeneration, particularly within the peripheral nervous system (Lee et al., 2016). However, emerging evidence underscores its potent anti-inflammatory effects, highlighting its critical role in modulating neuroinflammation in several neurological diseases (Bido et al., 2024; Dingledine et al., 2024). Neuroinflammation is a complex process involving immune cell activation, vascular modulation, and alterations of resident cells, namely astrocytes and microglia. It can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on brain pathologies (Simonato et al., 2006; DiSabato et al., 2016).",
        "A key aspect of this response is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which detect pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs), leading to immune cell activation (Iravani et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2022). Recent studies have shown that neurotrophic factors, including BDNF, NGF, and GDNF, play a crucial role in regulating neuroinflammatory pathways (Rocha et al., 2012; Guarino et al., 2022). Among these, GDNF is expressed by both astrocytes and microglia in pathological conditions, with astrocyte-secreted GDNF exerting a strong inhibitory effect on microglial activation, thereby mitigating neuroinflammation. GDNF can modulate the activation of microglia after Zymosan A (yeast-derived immune stimulant) treatment. It has been shown that the effect is dependent on GFRα1 and neutralization of GDNF or GFRα1, as well as GDNF silencing in astrocyte cultures, abolishes its regulatory effects, confirming that GDNF binding to the microglial GFRα1 receptor initiates intracellular signaling cascades responsible for suppressing microglial activation (Rocha et al., 2012).",
        "In hippocampal astrocytes, GDNF/GFRα1 signaling contributes to neuroprotection by regulating immune responses. The upregulation of GDNF and its receptor GFRα-1 in hippocampal neurons and astrocytes enhances resilience against thrombin-induced neurotoxicity, known mechanisms to activate microglia, and induce neuronal death (Yun et al., 2020). Recently, it has been highlighted that astrocytic Sterile Alpha and TIR Motif Containing 1 (SARM1), which plays a critical role in axonal degeneration and inflammation in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), promotes neuroinflammation and axonal demyelination by suppressing GDNF expression. Moreover, pharmacological reduction of GDNF worsened disease progression, reinforcing its neuroprotective function and therapeutic potential in MS (Jin et al., 2022). Beyond microglial regulation, GDNF modulates immune responses through GFL receptors, which are also expressed in immune cells. Activation of these receptors leads to the suppression of immune cell activity and the regulation of pro-inflammatory mediator release (Vargas-Leal et al., 2005).",
        "Besides the already discussed cell types, GDNF has been identified in less abundant cellular components, in particular endothelial cells and pericytes, where it can act as a modulator of Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB) and Blood-Nerve-Barrier (BNB) (Sharma et al., 2022). The BBB is a protective membrane that regulates molecular exchange between the bloodstream and neural tissue. Brain endothelial cells strictly limit the entry of molecules, particularly harmful ones, into the brain parenchyma. Indeed, a major challenge in CNS drug development is determining whether drug candidates can effectively cross the BBB. In recent years, several BBB and BNB models have been proposed, and Trans Endothelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) has been used as a key measure of barrier integrity, with values of 500 Ω × cm2 or higher indicating an intact BBB and values of 150 Ω × cm2 or higher indicating an intact BNB (Yosef and Ubogu, 2013). Studies have shown that GDNF strengthens the BBB by increasing tight junction protein expression, such as claudin-5, leading to elevated TEER values in various models, including porcine BBB and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (Igarashi et al., 1999; Shimizu et al., 2011; Kanjanasirirat et al., 2024). Similar effects were also demonstrated for BNB, where it was shown that MAPK signaling was essential for GDNF-mediated BNB TEER increase (Dong and Ubogu, 2018).",
        "Finally, oligodendrocytes have been shown to produce and secrete GDNF. In particular, differentiated oligodendrocytes were identified as a source of GDNF, which can activate distinct intracellular pathways in neurons (Wilkins et al., 2003). In particular, decreased release of GDNF by these cells has been linked with neurodegeneration in a model of Multiple system atrophy (Ubhi et al., 2010).",
        "Initially identified for its role in dopaminergic neuron survival, GDNF is a crucial neurotrophic factor that supports the survival, maintenance, and regeneration of neurons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). GDNF influences the development and function of peripheral neurons, including sensory, motor, and autonomic neuronal cells. It is produced by Schwann cells, muscle cells, and target tissues, creating a supportive microenvironment for nerve regeneration following injury. GDNF enhances axonal growth, promotes remyelination, and prevents neuronal apoptosis.",
        "Four ganglia in the cranial region host postganglionic parasympathetic neurons: the ciliary, sphenopalatine, submandibular, and otic ganglia. In newborn mice lacking RET, GFRα1, or GDNF, the otic and sphenopalatine ganglia are not present, indicating that the GDNF signaling through the GFRα1-RET receptor complex is critical for the development of these parasympathetic neurons during embryogenesis. Indeed, at embryonic day 12, these ganglia are already missing, and their neuronal precursors exhibit defects in migration and proliferation. Therefore, GDNF signaling through GFRα1–RET is necessary for the migration and proliferation of specific parasympathetic neuronal precursors in the early stages of embryonic development (Enomoto et al., 2000).",
        "Although in vitro studies showed that GFLs can support specific subpopulations of primary sensory neurons, their precise physiological functions in vivo remain largely unclear. Before birth, the survival of numerous primary sensory neurons in the petrosal ganglion relies on target-derived GDNF and BDNF (Erickson et al., 2001). These visceral chemoafferent neurons, which innervate the carotid body, play a role in the regulation of breathing. Indeed, mice lacking GDNF or RET exhibit respiratory disturbances, and mutations in these genes have been associated with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (Manié et al., 2001).",
        "Enteric neurons and ganglia originate from vagal and sacral neural crest cells, which migrate from the neural tube to the gut wall. Within the gut, they initially move in a rostrocaudal direction before transitioning from superficial to deeper layers. Following migration, these cells proliferate and differentiate to form the enteric plexus. In this context, GDNF/RET signaling is fundamental for the migration, proliferation, and survival of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) during the development of the enteric nervous system (Obermayr et al., 2013; Nagy and Goldstein, 2017). GDNF is secreted by mesodermal cells of the gut mesenchyme (Young et al., 2001), as well as by intestinal smooth muscle and epithelial cells in some pathological conditions (Xiao et al., 2014; Meir et al., 2015; Le Berre-Scoul et al., 2017). RET is expressed by ENCCs, while its co-receptor GFRα1 is required for efficient signaling. Studies in mice have demonstrated that the loss of function in GDNF, RET, or GFRα1 results in the complete absence of the enteric nervous system, underscoring the critical role of this pathway in gut innervation (Schuchardt et al., 1994; Moore et al., 1996; Cacalano et al., 1998). Experimental studies have shown that GDNF functions as a potent chemoattractant, reliably directing ENCC migration in vitro and in ex vivo explants (Natarajan et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2010). Overexpression or systemic administration of GDNF enhances ENCC proliferation and migration, increasing their numbers within the gut. However, while GDNF plays a crucial role in supporting the survival and neurogenesis of neuronal-fated ENCCs, it does not independently induce neural fate determination. Instead, it acts as a permissive factor, allowing the differentiation of ENCCs into specific neuronal subtypes at appropriate developmental stages (Wang et al., 2010). Recent studies also showed that GDNF supports intestinal barrier maturation and protects against inflammation-induced damage in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This finding highlights the role of enteric glial cells as a key source of GDNF, showing that its secretion enhances barrier function and prevents inflammatory breakdown, underscoring the importance of these cells in intestinal homeostasis (Meir et al., 2015; 2021). Collectively, these findings highlight the indispensable role of GDNF/RET signaling in enteric nervous system development, regulating ENCC migration, proliferation, and differentiation while ensuring the formation of functionally diverse neuronal populations.",
        "GDNF plays a crucial role in motor neuron survival and development (Henderson et al., 1994; Oppenheim et al., 1995). While it promotes motor neuron viability in vitro, studies in knockout mice have demonstrated that the absence of GDNF or its receptor RET results in a significant loss of lumbar spinal motor neurons at birth, particularly affecting γ-motor neurons that innervate intrafusal muscle spindles (Moore et al., 1996; Sánchez et al., 1996; Gould et al., 2008; Bonanomi et al., 2012). This indicates that GDNF-dependent RET activation is essential for early motor neuron development, acting through the co-receptor GFRα1 (Gould et al., 2008). However, RET signaling does not appear necessary for motor neuron survival in adulthood but contributes to neuromuscular junction (NMJ) maintenance and muscle innervation. Evidence suggests that amyloid precursor protein (APP)-regulated GDNF expression is crucial for NMJ integrity and muscle function (Stanga et al., 2016).",
        "Interestingly, altered GDNF levels have been observed in muscle biopsies and cerebrospinal fluid samples from ALS patients, suggesting its involvement in the disease (Yamamoto et al., 1999; Stanga et al., 2018). While its precise role in the pathology remains unclear, the GDNF/RET pathway may contribute to neuroprotection, as indicated by studies on the ALS drug Edaravone, which appears to exert its neuroprotective effects through this signaling axis (Li et al., 2022). Conversely, recent findings suggest that inhibiting RET tyrosine kinase activity could enhance retrograde transport in motor neurons (Rhymes et al., 2022), and its interaction with p75 may even promote apoptosis under certain conditions (Donnelly et al., 2018), highlighting the complexity of RET signaling in motor neuron health and disease.",
        "GDNF plays a critical neurotrophic role in the regeneration of the peripheral nervous system, especially in supporting motor neuron survival, promoting axonal outgrowth, and enabling target muscle reinnervation after injury. GDNF delivery has been shown to protect motor neurons from apoptosis, stimulate robust axonal regeneration, and improve reinnervation of muscle targets, ultimately restoring neuromuscular function (Cintron-Colon et al., 2022). Recent studies highlight that timed delivery of GDNF enhances long-distance axonal regeneration and functional recovery in severe injury models like ventral root avulsion (Eggers et al., 2020a; 2020b). Sustained GDNF expression via viral vectors or hydrogels promotes neuromuscular junction repair and muscle fiber preservation, especially when delivered locally to the nerve or muscle (Kokai et al., 2011; Cintron-Colon et al., 2022). Furthermore, GDNF combined with biomaterial scaffolds such as nerve conduits or engineered Schwann cell grafts has shown enhanced reinnervation efficiency and reduced denervation-induced muscle atrophy (Zhang et al., 2009; Carvalho et al., 2021), although some contrasting results on the GDNF release and dosage are emerging (Kong et al., 2021). Altogether, these findings establish GDNF as a pivotal factor in peripheral nerve repair strategies, supporting both the neural and the muscular components of regeneration.",
        "Outside the nervous system, GDNF is essential for kidney morphogenesis by mediating reciprocal inductive signaling between the nephrogenic mesenchyme and the ureteric bud (Sariola and Saarma, 2003). GDNF, expressed in the mesenchyme, binds to RET and GFRα1 on the ureteric bud, promoting its branching and nephron formation (Suvanto et al., 1996; Sainio et al., 1997). Knockout studies of GDNF, RET, or GFRα1 result in severe renal defects, highlighting their critical role (Pichel et al., 1996; Saarma and Sariola, 1999). Factors such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans and transcription factors like Pax2 and Eya1 further regulate GDNF expression and function in kidney development (Brophy et al., 2001).",
        "GDNF is secreted by Sertoli cells and plays a crucial role in regulating spermatogenesis through paracrine signaling. RET and GFRα1 are expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia, which include spermatogenic stem cells. GDNF dosage is critical for stem cell balance: reduced levels lead to excessive differentiation and depletion, while overexpression causes undifferentiated spermatogonia clustering and infertility (reviewed in (Parekh et al., 2019).",
        "GDNF and its receptors play a crucial role in various cancers by influencing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In neuroendocrine tumors, GDNF is highly expressed in growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas but absent in most other pituitary tumors, suggesting a potential link to growth hormone signaling (Japo´n et al., 2002). RET activation by GDNF regulates somatotroph populations via the p53 apoptotic pathway, with Pit-1 transcription factor mediating this effect (Shewchuk et al., 2006; Cañibano et al., 2007). In pancreatic cancer, GDNF and its receptors are widely expressed, promoting tumor proliferation, invasion, and perineural infiltration through integrin β1 and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) upregulation (Okada et al., 2003; Liu H. et al., 2012). Similarly, gliomas exhibit elevated GDNF levels, which enhance migration via the MAPK and JNK pathways and confer chemoresistance, while Growth Arrest Specific 1, a protein that is structurally homologous with the GFRα receptors, blocks this process by inhibiting RET signaling (Song and Moon, 2006; Domínguez-Monzón et al., 2009; Ng et al., 2009). In colorectal cancer, GDNF activates the RET/GFRα1 complex, enhancing β1 integrin expression and increasing VEGF-VEGFR-mediated migration through p38, PI3K/Akt, and HIF1α pathways (Huang et al., 2014). Breast cancer cells also express RET and GFRα1, responding to both autocrine and paracrine GDNF signaling (Neve et al., 2006; Esseghir et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2009). Testicular cancer is associated with GDNF overexpression, promoting invasive seminoma behavior (Sariola and Meng 2003; Ferranti et al., 2012). In melanoma, GDNF-driven RET activation correlates with malignancy, significantly enhancing proliferation and invasion through phosphorylated Tyr905 in human melanoma cells (Kato et al., 1998; 2007; Narita et al., 2009; Ohshima et al., 2010).",
        "Collectively, these findings underscore the oncogenic potential of GDNF signaling across multiple cancer types. The GDNF-RET axis functions as a double-edged sword that requires precise regulation to achieve therapeutic benefits. In certain oncological diseases, inhibiting this axis may be advantageous, while enhancing it could be vital for the survival of neurons in various neurological disorders. In the final chapter, we will concentrate on the latter therapeutic approach.",
        "Looking at the complex biology of GDNF (Figure 2), there are still several areas where our understanding remains incomplete. While we know some transcription factors [e.g., EGR1, CREB - (Liu et al., 2020; Marks et al., 2023)] that can induce GDNF expression, the full regulatory network controlling its expression in different tissues and under different physiological or pathological conditions is not well mapped and we still do not completely understand how GDNF expression is modulated in response to injury, inflammation, or neurodegeneration. From the signaling point of view, the biological relevance and downstream effects of the engagement of RET-independent pathways are still being explored, to define if they are compensatory, redundant or used to generate specialized signals.",
        "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) functions. In the healthy nervous system, GDNF expression is mainly neuronal. The engagement of GDNF receptors in the neuronal membrane by GDNF binding triggers an intracellular signaling cascade that promotes different effects, such as survival and differentiation. In diseased states, GDNF can also be expressed by glial cells. Glial GDNF expression can promote neuroprotection, neuronal survival and modulate astrocyte and microglial activation, but sustained GDNF overexpression can lead to adverse effects. Outside the CNS (lateral panel), GDNF has fundamental roles in kidney morphogenesis, spermatogenesis in testis and maintenance of the blood brain barrier. GDNF can also have a role in inducing proliferation of certain tumors (see text).",
        "The same can be said regarding context-dependent signaling, with specific responses, occurring most likely due to differences in receptor expression, co-signaling molecules, or epigenetic state of the cells, that still need to be clarified. For example, GDNF role in normal homeostasis of mature neurons, especially in the adult brain and peripheral autonomic system, is not well defined, while its role in pathology has been more characterized. GDNF interacts or overlaps with other neurotrophic factors like NGF, BDNF and Neurturin, but the functional cross-talk, synergy, or competition among these factors is still not fully understood. Finally, the mechanisms of secretion, diffusion, and gradient formation of GDNF in vivo remain technically hard to measure and model. Understanding GDNF distribution, degradation and turnover will be essential for both biology and therapeutic design.",
        "Since its identification, GDNF, along with other GFLs, has sparked significant interest in the scientific community for its potential as a therapeutic agent in treating various neurological disorders. Multiple pre-clinical studies demonstrated that GDNF delivery supports the long-term motor neuron survival and axon regeneration following peripheral nerve injury in both newborn and adult mice (Hottinger et al., 2000; Eggers et al., 2019; Cintron-Colon et al., 2022). Additionally, GDNF has been found to have a potent analgesic effect in neuropathic pain models (Boucher et al., 2000) and to facilitate sensory axon regeneration into the spinal cord after dorsal root injury, thereby restoring sensory function (Ramer et al., 2000).",
        "GDNF has also emerged as a potential antiepileptic candidate. GDNF and its receptor are expressed in the pyramidal and granule cells of the hippocampus, and a link has been found between the neurotrophic factor levels and epilepsy, since locally increasing GDNF levels in the temporal lobe can suppress epileptic activity (Kanter-Schlifke et al., 2007; Nanobashvili et al., 2019; Paolone et al., 2019).",
        "In experimental models of focal ischemia, administering exogenous GDNF before or immediately after anoxia has been shown to reduce ischemic brain injury. Specifically, GDNF appears to mitigate excitotoxic neuronal death through an ERK-dependent pathway, making early administration crucial in the treatment of stroke (Wang et al., 1997).",
        "The involvement of GDNF in regulating dopaminergic neuronal plasticity has shown promise in influencing the biochemical adaptation processes and the rewarding effects associated with drug addiction, suggesting its potential application in the treatment of substance or alcohol abuse (Messer et al., 2000; Ford et al., 2023).",
        "Given its vital role in promoting the survival of dopaminergic neurons, GDNF has also demonstrated its ability to prevent neurotoxin-induced death of dopamine neurons and to facilitate functional recovery in various animal models of Parkinson’s disease (Kearns and Gash, 1995; Tomac et al., 1995; Airaksinen and Saarma, 2002; Barker et al., 2020). These findings paved the way for the transition to clinical studies. Initial Phase I and II trials using direct intraventricular or intraputaminal infusion of GDNF (Kordower et al., 1999; Gill et al., 2003; Nutt et al., 2003; Love et al., 2005; Slevin et al., 2005) showed promising motor improvements and good safety profiles. However, a larger placebo-controlled Phase II trial (Lang et al., 2006) failed to show significant clinical benefit, raising concerns about inconsistent delivery and variable efficacy. More recent efforts in PD have focused on using convection-enhanced delivery (CED) systems (Barua et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2013; Whone et al., 2019) and gene therapy vectors [e.g., AAV2-GDNF - (Rocco et al., 2022; Heiss et al., 2024)] to improve distribution and achieve sustained expression in the putamen of treated patients. These trials have shown better target coverage and encouraging biomarker responses (increased [18F]-DOPA uptake), but clinical improvements (and particularly systemic motor score improvements) remain modest or variable (Barker et al., 2020), underscoring the limitations that still need to be overcome to fully exploit GDNF therapeutic potential.",
        "Despite encouraging preclinical results, clinical translation remains complex due to issues related to optimal dosing, delivery methods, and long-term safety. Nonetheless, GDNF continues to be a promising candidate for the development of novel neurorestorative therapies. One of the primary challenges is effective delivery to target tissues, particularly the central nervous system, due to the BBB. Direct intracerebral administration, while bypassing the BBB, is highly invasive and may result in uneven distribution and local tissue damage. Furthermore, one of the biggest challenges is indeed optimization of the dose of GDNF, which is complicated by its narrow therapeutic window. Indeed, low doses may be insufficient to elicit a neuroprotective or neurorestorative effect, while high doses can lead to adverse physiological changes. For instance, in preclinical models, excessive GDNF has been shown to cause ectopic or abnormal sprouting of dopaminergic fibres, especially in the striatum, which may disrupt normal circuitry (Georgievska, 2002; Marshall, 2023). It can also downregulate tyrosine hydroxylase, a key enzyme in dopamine synthesis, thereby paradoxically impairing dopaminergic signaling over time. Short half-life and rapid degradation in the extracellular space further limit its efficacy when delivered exogenously. In addition, variability in patient response and limited efficacy observed in clinical trials in Parkinson’s disease highlight the need for improved delivery platforms, such as gene therapy or controlled-release systems. Finally, concerns regarding long-term safety, immune responses, and potential off-target effects pose additional hurdles that must be addressed before GDNF can be widely adopted in therapeutic settings.",
        "Another layer of complexity is the temporal aspect: GDNF’s effects may vary depending on the stage of disease progression, meaning that timing and duration of treatment are just as critical as dose magnitude. Chronic overexpression—such as in some preclinical gene therapy approaches—may lead to long-term dysregulation of neuronal homeostasis or immune activation.",
        "Finally, inter-individual variability—due to differences in GDNF receptor (RET and GFRα1) expression levels, regional pathology, or genetic background—further complicates standardized dosing protocols, making personalized approaches potentially necessary for safe and effective use.",
        "GDNF has long been studied for its neuroprotective effects, however, it also has broader physiological roles that still need elucidation. GDNF is indeed critical for the development, survival, and maintenance of dopaminergic, sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric neurons, and it plays essential roles in organ systems such as the kidney, testis, and gastrointestinal tract. Its involvement in tissue regeneration and modulation of inflammatory responses underscores its broader impact on homeostasis. Finally, the diversity of GDNF signaling pathways makes it a rich model for exploring ligand-receptor dynamics, signal integration, and cell-type specificity. In this review we explored GDNF’s endogenous functions—beyond its therapeutic potential—providing insight into its fundamental role as a neurotrophic factor in neural and non-neural systems, reframing GDNF as a multifaceted regulator of physiological function, rather than solely as a neurotrophic therapeutic.",

        "Parkinson’s disease (PD) manifests as a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuronal depletion in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) [1,2]. PD patients display motor symptoms, including tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, and non-motor symptoms, particularly gut motility [3,4]. Levodopa serves as the gold standard treatment for PD, but adverse side effects, such as dyskinesias, over the course of treatment complicate clinical outcomes [5].",
        "Recognizing the limited efficacy of pharmacological treatments, which essentially offer palliative instead of disease-modifying outcomes, finding a novel therapy that retards or halts PD progression is an urgent clinical need [1]. Stem cell transplantation has emerged as a disease-modifying strategy for PD [6,7,8,9], acting via cell replacement and bystander effects, e.g., neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory factor secretion [10,11,12]. New evidence suggests that transplanted cells target the gut–brain axis (GBA) by dampening the gut’s inflammatory response and attenuating the neurodegenerative cell death cascades in the brain [13,14,15]. Indeed, our group has recently demonstrated that intravenous transplantation of human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) and plasma (P) reduced motor deficits, improved nigral dopaminergic neuronal survival, and dampened α-synuclein in multiple rodent and murine PD models, including 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine (MPTP), and transgenic α-synuclein-overexpression [13,14,15]. To further test the direct involvement of the GBA in stem cell therapy, the present study directly implanted hUCB and P into the gut of transgenic α-synuclein-overexpressing mice (Figure 1). The results nullified our original hypothesis of enhanced therapeutic effects of intragut delivery of hUCB and P, in that transplanted transgenic α-synuclein-overexpressing mice displayed an exacerbation of motor and gut motility deficits and aggravated expression of inflammatory microbiota, cytokines, and α-synuclein in both their gut and brain. While the GBA significantly contributes to PD inflammation, directly targeting the gut for stem cell delivery worsens functional outcomes. Stem cell delivery via a minimally invasive approach, such as the intravenous route as shown in our previous studies [13,14,15], appears to be a safer and more effective cell delivery approach to ameliorate PD symptoms by circumventing the gut’s inherent inflammatory response to PD pathology.",
        "Behavioral analyses. To test whether intragut implantation enhances functional recovery, animals were tested in two motor tasks, namely rotarod and beam walk tests (Figure 2). Unexpectedly, results revealed that Wt + Tx and Tg + Tx significantly performed worse than their corresponding strains that received the vehicle, i.e., Wt + Vehicle and Tg + Vehicle (p’s < 0.05) in both tasks across post-transplantation testing days (rotarod: p  <  0.0001; F9,32  =  7.608; beam walk: p  <  0.0001; F9,32  =  7.396). Pairwise comparisons revealed that Tg mice performed worse than Wt mice (p < 0.05) across all time points in both tasks, with the transplanted groups clearly performing worse than their vehicle counterparts (p’s < 0.05), except on day 7 for the beam walk test, which showed that Wt + Tx exhibited significantly more severe motor balance than Tg + Vehicle (p < 0.05).",
        "Gut functional assays. To assess whether intragut transplantation improved gut functions, we tested animals in colonic propulsion and gastric-emptying tasks. To our surprise, results revealed that Wt + Tx and Tg + Tx significantly performed worse than their corresponding strains that received the vehicle, i.e., Wt + Vehicle and Tg + Vehicle (p’s < 0.05) in both tasks (colonic propulsion: p  <  0.0001; F3,8  =  69.61; gastric emptying: p  <  0.0001; F3,8  =  403.8). Pairwise comparisons revealed that Tg mice performed worse than Wt mice (p’s < 0.05) in both tasks, with the transplanted groups obviously performing worse than their vehicle counterparts (p’s < 0.05).",
        "Gut microbiome analysis. We used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to reveal the inflammation-associated microbiota within the feces of the animals by focusing on probes for BAC303, EREC482, and LAB158, which we previously identified as sensitive to PD pathology [13,14,15] (Figure 2). In tandem with the motor and gut functional tests, our results surprisingly revealed that Wt + Tx and Tg + Tx significantly displayed highly elevated inflammation-associated microbiota than their corresponding strains that received the vehicle, i.e., Wt + Vehicle and Tg + Vehicle (p’s < 0.05) in all three microbiota (BAC303: p  <  0.0001; F3,8  =  106.7; EREC482: p  <  0.0001; F3,8  =  100.2; LAB158: p  <  0.0001; F3,8  =  72.61). Pairwise comparisons revealed that Tg + Vehicle, Tg + Tx, and Wt + Tx performed worse than Wt + Vehicle (p’s < 0.05) in all three microbiota examined here (p’s < 0.05).",
        "Histopathology of PD brain. We next examined α-synuclein immunostaining in the brain (Figure 3), which revealed significantly elevated α-synuclein levels in Tg mice compared to Wt mice (p < 0.0001; F3,8  =  1937), with Tg + Tx significantly exhibiting the highest level of α-synuclein expression compared to the other treatment groups (p’s < 0.05). TH immunostaining (Figure 3) revealed that Tg mice showed a significantly more severe (p  <  0.0001; F3,8  =  694.4) dopaminergic depletion compared to Wt mice (p’s < 0.05). Moreover, inflammatory markers OX6 and TNF-α showed significantly increased recruitment of immune and inflammatory cells in the SNpc (Figure 3) (OX6: p  <  0.0001; F3,8  =  1592; TNF-α: p  <  0.0001; F3,8  =  1348) with the Tg + Tx mice significantly displaying the highest upregulation of inflammation compared to the other treatment groups (p’s < 0.05).",
        "Histopathology of gut mucosa. We similarly assessed α-synuclein and inflammation levels in the gut (Figure 3). Results showed a significantly upregulated expression of α-synuclein and inflammatory markers in Tg mice compared to Wt mice (α-synuclein: p  <  0.0001; F3,8  =  218.5; OX6: p  <  0.0001; F3,8  =  591.6; TNF-α: p  <  0.0001; F3,8  =  2523), with Tg + Tx exhibiting the highest level of α-synuclein, OX6, and TNF-α expression compared to the other treatment groups (p’s < 0.05).",
        "Our findings revealed that intragut transplantation of stem cells worsened PD motor and non-motor symptoms coupled with upregulation of inflammation-relevant microbiota and cytokines in the gut and brain of transgenic mice. Additionally, such an invasive cell delivery approach even worsened the behavioral performance of wild-type animals, suggesting that, while the GBA is a critical source of inflammation in PD, direct implantation of stem cells into the gut may not improve, and may even exacerbate functional outcomes. One of the causes of the observed exacerbation can be ascribed to the fact that the direct transplantation of stem cells may alter the colonic barrier, allowing the passage of bacteria metabolites into the blood and worsening the motor symptoms [16]. Moreover, it has been reported that PD patients present a leaky gut and the transplantation of stem cells can even worsen the condition, thus impairing motor performances [16].",
        "Pharmacological treatments such as Levodopa have shown robust clinical improvements in PD patients [5]. However, over time, the drug’s adverse effects limit the efficacy of these treatments [5]. In addition, pharmacological treatments only offer palliative rather than disease-modifying outcomes in PD [5]. Stem cell transplantation for PD has been shown safe and effective in laboratory studies, but with varying efficacy readouts in the clinic [17]. To this end, cell replacement and by-stander effects have been implicated as mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of stem cell therapy in PD and other neurological disorders [18,19]. Recent studies have suggested that transplanted stem cells may solicit the GBA signaling pathway by sequestering inflammatory signals originating from the gut, thereby dampening the inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative cascade of cell death processes in the brain [20,21,22].",
        "We recently demonstrated that intravenous transplantation of stem cells reduced gut-inflammation-associated microbiota and cytokines, coinciding with the rescue of behavioral and histological deficits in PD animal models [13,14,15]. In an effort to probe a cause-and-effect interaction between the transplanted stem cells and the GBA, we have now examined the functional effects of direct implantation of stem cells into the gut. Unfortunately, the results nullified our hypothesis, with intragut-transplanted mice exhibiting worsened PD behavioral and histological symptoms and aggravated inflammatory microbiota and cytokines in the gut and brain.",
        "Because the gut is already inflamed during the course of PD pathology, a traumatic intervention, such as the present transplantation into the superior mesenteric artery, likely compounded the gut’s inflammatory response to the disease progression. Indeed, the three microbiota that we previously identified as closely associated with gut inflammation, namely BAC303, EREC482, and LAB158, were all significantly elevated in transplanted Tg mice. Intragut transplantation of stem cells even elevated these three microbiotas in Wt mice, indicating the severe traumatic consequence of such an invasive cell delivery regimen. While hUCB cells reached the gut (data not shown), this intragut transplantation exacerbated deleterious gut microbiota, upregulating inflammatory cytokines, including OX6 and TNF-α, ultimately leading to aberrant accumulation of α-synuclein in both gut and brain. That gut inflammation precedes α-synuclein aggregation, leading to neurodegeneration, has been shown as a vicious cell death event in PD [23,24,25].",
        "In summary, the present observations further implicate the participation of the GBA in PD pathology, with the gut-inflammation-associated microbiota contributing to α-synuclein over-expression and subsequent neurodegeneration, and eventually, to the disease’s behavioral and histological hallmarks. Directly implanting stem cells into the gut may not be beneficial in arresting the peripheral inflammatory response. Instead, a minimally invasive route of cell administration, such as the intravenous approach, seems safer and more effective in diminishing the GBA’s pathological impact on the disease process.",

        "Animal preparation and transplantation. The present study followed experimental procedures approved by the University of South Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and in adherence to the ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines [26]. Additionally, animal handling and surgical processes were done to minimize discomfort and pain, based on the ethical regulations of the European Communities Council (Directive 2010/63/EU, protocol #542/2019-PR). Blinding of investigators to the treatment conditions was carried out until study completion. We enrolled 14-month-old male C57BL/6NJ (wild type or Wt) and C57BL/6N-Tg (Thy1-SNCA)15Mjff/J mice (transgenic or Tg) (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The choice of the age of Tg mice was based on previous studies [15] that showed that such age corresponds to overexpression of the wild-type human α-synuclein, with validated phenotypic, PD-like progressive nigrostriatal dopamine depletion and motor deficits. The mice enrolled in this study had free access to food and water, were housed under normal conditions (20 °C, 50% relative humidity, and a 12 h light/dark cycle), and were randomly assigned to a group by a staff member not involved in the study: Wt + Vehicle (n  =  4), Wt + hUCB + P transplants or Wt + Tx (n  =  4), Tg + Vehicle (n  =  4), and Tg + Tx (n  =  4). Transplantation involved delivery of 0.4 × 106 hUCB cells in 50 μL of plasma (Figure 1). To deliver the cells into the small intestine, we followed the microsurgery procedure that targets the superior mesenteric artery, which supplies blood to the small and large intestine [16].",
        "Behavioral tests (Rotarod and Beam Walk). Detailed descriptions of the rotarod test and beam walk test have been previously reported [15]. The rotarod test used a rotating drum (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA, USA) to assess the animal’s ability to balance over three trials on a rotating rod with speeds starting at 4 rpm and accelerating to 40 rpm in 300 s. The beam walk test assessed forelimb and hindlimb function using semi-quantitative scoring of grades 0 to 3. Animals underwent both tasks at baseline (prior to transplantation) and at days 1, 3, and 7 post-transplantations.",

        "Gastric emptying. Additionally, as previously reported [15], a solution of charcoal (10%) and acacia gum (2%) was given via oral gavage to the animal on the last survival day. Following euthanasia, the animal’s intestine was harvested, and the length (cm) that the charcoal solution traveled was measured. This test was conducted on day 7.",
        "Tissue collection. Animals were deeply anesthetized, then perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS [15]. The intestines and brains of these animals were harvested and fixed. Coronal cryosections (40 µm) were processed from analyses.",
        "Microbiome analysis. Following our previous protocol [15], fecal microbiota was analyzed and identified using FISH. The FISH images were collected and analyzed at 40× with the aid of an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope with Fluoview SV1000 imaging software.",

As described previously [15], immunostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (1:100 TH, AB152; Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), α-synuclein (1:250, NBP2-15365; NOVUS, Centennial, CO, USA), MHC II (OX-6; NB100-65541; Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA) and TNF-α (ab6671; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was captured throughout the entire SNpc or gut. AlexaFluor 488 and 594 secondary antibodies were used. Image analyses were conducted using an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with Fluoview SV1000 imaging software. The exclusion of primary antibodies substituted with 3% normal horse serum in PBS served as the controls, which showed a lack of immunoreactivity.",
        "Statistical analysis. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and subsequent post hoc Bonferroni’s test with statistical significance set at p  <  0.05 (GraphPad version 5.01).

Direct implantation of stem cells to the gut exacerbated motor deficits in rotarod and beam walk tests with stem cell-transplanted mice performing significantly worse than vehicle-transplanted mice.

The exacerbation of motor and non-motor symptoms in transplanted animals coincided with increased levels of gut-inflammation-relevant microbiota, BAC303, EREC482, and LAB158 (* p’s < 0.05; ** p’s < 0.01; *** p’s < 0.001; **** p’s < 0.0001).",

The predominant pathology of PD is the loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra. Cell transplantation is a strategy with significant potential for treating PD; mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a tremendous therapeutic cell source because they are easily accessible. MSC-derived exosomes with potential protective action in lesioned sites serve as an essential promoter of neuroprotection, and neurodifferentiation, by modulating neural stem cells, neurons, glial cells, and axonal growth in vitro and in vivo environments. The biological properties of MSC-derived exosomes have been proposed as a beneficial tool in different pathological conditions, including PD. Therefore, in this review, we assort the current understanding of MSC-derived exosomes as a new possible therapeutic strategy for PD by providing an overview of the potential role of miRNAs as a component of exosomes in the cellular and molecular basis of PD.

This review underscores the transformative impact of exosome-based drug delivery, paving the way for next-generation therapies that can effectively penetrate the BBB and revolutionize neuropharmacology.",
        "Nanobiotechnology has revolutionized medicine, particularly in drug delivery systems. Among the latest advancements, exosome-mediated drug delivery has emerged as a promising strategy for treating neurological disorders. Exosomes are nanometer-scale extracellular vesicles secreted by virtually all cell types, playing key roles in intercellular communication by transporting biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Given their natural ability to traverse biological barriers, exosomes are now being explored as vehicles for delivering therapeutics across the formidable Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), a challenge that has long hindered effective neuropharmaceutical interventions [1].",
        "Neuropharmaceuticals refer to therapeutic agents specifically designed to diagnose, prevent, or treat neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric conditions, and brain tumors. These compounds encompass a broad range of drugs, from small molecules and peptides to biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, gene therapies, and RNA-based treatments. Despite their therapeutic potential, the successful delivery of neuropharmaceuticals to the central nervous system (CNS) remains a significant obstacle due to the BBB’s highly selective nature [2]. Exosome-based drug delivery represents a transformative approach to overcoming this limitation, enabling precise, non-invasive, and effective transport of neuropharmaceutical agents into the brain [3].",
        "The rationale for using exosomes in neuropharmaceutical applications lies in their unparalleled biocompatibility, stability, and immune-evasive properties. Unlike synthetic nanoparticles, exosomes are inherently non-immunogenic, allowing for prolonged circulation without triggering adverse immune responses. This is particularly crucial for CNS-targeted therapies, as traditional drug delivery strategies often fail due to rapid clearance, limited penetration, or off-target effects. The endogenous nature of exosomes makes them uniquely suited for crossing the BBB while preserving its structural integrity, thereby minimizing potential toxicity and inflammatory responses [4].",
        "The BBB represents the most significant impediment to effective neurological treatment. This protective structure consists of endothelial cells joined by tight junctions, preventing most therapeutic agents from accessing the brain parenchyma [5, 6]. While various strategies have been developed to enhance BBB permeability—including invasive techniques, chemical modifications, and synthetic nanocarriers—these methods often present limitations such as inefficacy, cytotoxicity, or disruption of normal brain function [7]. In contrast, exosomes, particularly those derived from neural or immune cells, exhibit intrinsic brain-targeting capabilities, leveraging receptor-mediated interactions to facilitate transcytosis across the BBB [8].",
        "Recent research has highlighted the potential of exosomes as versatile carriers for neuropharmaceuticals, delivering drugs, RNA-based therapies, and CRISPR-Cas systems directly to the CNS [9]. Their lipid bilayer structure, enriched with specific surface proteins, enables dynamic interaction with cellular receptors, promoting endocytosis and transcytosis across the BBB. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of exosome-mediated drug delivery in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, where conventional treatments struggle to achieve sufficient brain penetration. Exosomes not only enable targeted drug delivery but also protect encapsulated therapeutics from enzymatic degradation, enhancing bioavailability and therapeutic impact [10].",
        "Beyond neurodegeneration, exosome-based strategies hold promise for treating brain tumors, psychiatric disorders, and traumatic brain injuries [11]. Functionalized exosomes can be engineered with surface ligands, antibodies, or peptides to enhance specificity and efficacy, thereby reducing off-target effects. For example, in glioblastoma models, engineered exosomes have successfully delivered chemotherapeutic agents with improved tumor targeting while sparing healthy tissues [12]. Similarly, exosome-mediated delivery of small molecules offers new avenues for modulating neural circuits in psychiatric conditions such as depression and schizophrenia, where conventional drugs often fall short due to poor BBB penetration and systemic side effects [13, 14].",
        "The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive and analytical exploration of exosome-powered neuropharmaceuticals, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize CNS drug delivery. By synthesizing the latest advancements in exosome research, nanobiotechnology, and neuropharmaceutical engineering, this paper aims to elucidate the mechanisms, applications, and challenges of leveraging exosomes to address the BBB challenge. Additionally, emerging trends, including artificial intelligence (AI)-driven optimization of exosome engineering and multimodal therapeutic approaches, will be discussed. Ultimately, this review aspires to establish a foundational framework for advancing exosome-based neuropharmaceuticals from experimental research to clinical application, redefining drug delivery paradigms for neurological health.",
        "Exosomes are thereby the key players in intercellular communication and, at the same time, also bear fundamental knowledge about increasing application in nanobiotechnology and therapeutic treatment. Thereby, they uniquely position due to structural and functional properties, in addition to breakthroughs achieved recently during engineering and applications, laying a platform for them among biomedical sciences today, mostly regarding the unmet healthcare challenges like neurological disorders, hard to be treated to date.",
        "The size of exosomes, another name for extracellular vesicles (EVs), usually ranges between 30 and 150 nm in diameter; they are bound by a lipid bilayer. Their secretion occurs in almost every type of cell, transporting biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, and even nucleic acids like mRNA, miRNA, and long non-coding RNAs (Fig. 1). It is with the help of these cargo molecules that intercellular targeting is achieved in communication between two or more different types of cells [15, 16].",
        "Their protective lipid bilayer protects the cargo from enzymatic degradation and confers stability to exosomes in biological fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva. The embedded membrane tetraspanins, for example, CD9, CD63, and CD81, integrins, and heat shock proteins play a critical role in determining exosome-cell interactions and selective uptake via receptor-mediated endocytosis [17]. Table 1 summarize the various proteins involved in exosome biology and functions. Several new exosomal biomarkers associated with disease states have been also identified by emerging research, thus enabling their use in diagnostics and prognostics [18].",

        "Comprehensive Composition of Exosomes",
        "Exosomes are enriched with a diverse array of molecular components that play vital roles in intercellular communication and physiological processes. Their membranes contain key proteins, including tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, CD81), glycoproteins, adhesion molecules, antigen-presenting molecules, and cell-specific receptors. Additionally, exosomal membranes incorporate transmembrane proteins, internal membrane transport proteins, fusion proteins, and heat shock proteins (HSPs). Within their lumen, exosomes house cytoskeletal proteins, ESCRT complexes, growth factors, and cytokines. Their lipid composition, essential for structural integrity and stability, includes cholesterol, ceramides, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), and gangliosides (GM). Furthermore, exosomes carry various nucleic acids, including DNA, mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), non-coding RNA (ncRNA), and other RNA species, contributing to their critical roles in gene regulation and cellular signaling.",
        "The process of exosome formation is tightly regulated and occurs in the endosomal compartment. Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) containing intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) are generated by inward budding of the endosomal membrane. When MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane, the ILVs are released as exosomes into the extracellular space [19].",

        "Proteins involved in exosome biology and their functions",
        "Recent studies have established a refined view of the molecular mechanisms regulating exosome biogenesis. The coordinated action of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) complex, together with ESCRT-independent pathways, including ceramide and tetraspanins, ensures cargo sorting and vesicle formation. Rab GTPases-Rab27a and Rab35, in particular-tune MVB docking and fusion at the plasma membrane, allowing spatiotemporal regulation of exosome release [20]. Figure 2 represent the exosome biogenesis and release in detials. Exosome release is highly influenced by environmental cues, such as hypoxia and oxidative stress. For example, hypoxic conditions enhance the secretion of proangiogenic and metastatic exosomes, thus linking their biogenesis to tumor progression and tissue repair [21].",
        "Fig. 2Diagrammatic representation of exosome biogenesis and release.

There are three possible ways that exosomes can be formed from endosomes, depending on the molecules and mechanisms involved. These are: ceramide-tetraspanin way, ALIX way, and ESCRT1-2 way. The figure also shows that besides these pathways, exosomes can become lysosomes or autolysosomes. Numerous exosomal surface proteins interact with cellular receptors to enable exosomes to adhere to recipient cells. Exosomes can cause a variety of effects after this adherence: (1) By initiating the transduction of signals through intracellular signaling pathways and subsequent release (referred to as juxtacrine signaling). (2) By merging with the cellular membrane, enabling the transfer of both proteins and genetic contents into the recipient cell’s cytoplasm (fusion). (3) By being internalized through mechanisms such as receptor-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis or phagocytosis",

(3) By being internalized through mechanisms such as receptor-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis or phagocytosis",
        "Compared with synthetic nanoparticles, exosomes have unparalleled advantages in many ways: (1) since exosomes originate from natural cellular processes, they show high biocompatibility with reduced immunogenicity. This minimizes the risk of adverse immune reactions and prolongs systemic circulation [22, 23]. (2) Exosomes are capable of crossing complex biological barriers, including the BBB. Their surface molecules, like LAMP2B and integrins, allow receptor-mediated transcytosis across endothelial cells, making them good vehicles for CNS drug delivery [24]. (3) Targeted delivery with exosomes can be achieved either by inheriting parent cell markers or through engineered surface modifications. For instance, rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG)-peptide-modified exosomes can deliver therapeutic siRNA at a higher efficiency into neuron cells than nontargeting particles [25]. (4) Exosomes are functioning as carriers for a whole range of therapeutic agents-carried small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acid. The recent development indeed extends its application to their use as transporters with genome-editing tools at the CRISPR-Cas9 component level of resolution [26]. (5) Encapsulation within the lipid bilayer secures exosomal cargo from metabolic degradation and confers, in turn, increased robustness that can enhance its salutary effect [27]. (6) Exosomes inherit the tropism of their parental cells, which means they target active delivery to specific tissues or organs. This attribute, in particular, is valuable in cancer therapy and regenerative medicine [28]. (7) Large-scale production of exosomes was made possible with advances in biomanufacturing, featuring high purity and yield. Ultracentrifugation, tangential flow filtration, and size-exclusion chromatography are some of the techniques that have helped in making these processes more clinical for scalability [29].",
        "The BBB is a dynamic and specialized vascular interface that plays a pivotal role in maintaining the homeostasis of the CNS. Acting as a gatekeeper between the systemic circulation and the neuronal milieu, the BBB meticulously regulates the exchange of nutrients, ions, and metabolites while preventing the entry of harmful substances and pathogens. Advances in molecular biology and neuroimaging have provided transformative insights into the structural and functional dynamics of the BBB, underscoring its significance in health and disease.",
        "The BBB is a complex structure formed by specialized endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytic end-feet, collectively known as the neurovascular unit (NVU) (Fig. 3A). The endothelial cells of the cerebral microvasculature form the primary structural component of the BBB. These cells are characterized by the presence of tight junctions (TJs), which are composed of proteins such as claudins, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (Fig. 3B). These proteins work together to restrict paracellular permeability, ensuring the selective transport of substances. Recent studies have highlighted the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in maintaining endothelial TJ integrity, as well as the regulatory influence of shear stress on endothelial cell function and tight junction assembly [30]. Additionally, endothelial cells possess specialized transport mechanisms, including solute carriers and efflux pumps like P-glycoprotein, which prevent the accumulation of xenobiotics and maintain brain homeostasis [31]. Pericytes are embedded within the basement membrane and make extensive physical contact with endothelial cells. These cells play a critical role in regulating BBB permeability, angiogenesis, and the immune response. Pericytes communicate with endothelial cells through gap junctions and signaling molecules, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [32]. In pathological conditions, such as stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, the loss of pericytes disrupts BBB integrity, leading to increased vascular permeability and inflammation [33]. Astrocytic end-feet ensheath the endothelial cells, playing a vital role in the induction and maintenance of the BBB. Astrocytes secrete a variety of factors, including glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and sonic hedgehog (SHH), which promote endothelial barrier properties. They also regulate water and ion homeostasis via the expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) channels [30]. Recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) modeling have demonstrated the synergistic interactions between astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells in maintaining BBB function, revealing their coordinated response to injury or inflammation [34]. The basement membrane is a specialized Extracellular matrix (ECM) that provides structural and biochemical support to the BBB. It is composed of laminins, collagen IV, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which contribute to cellular adhesion and signaling. Studies indicate that pericytes and astrocytes regulate the composition and morphology of the ECM, ensuring the stability of the neurovascular unit [35]. Damage to the basement membrane has been linked to age-related BBB dysfunction, emphasizing its critical role in barrier integrity [36].",
        "The BBB plays a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of the CNS by selectively regulating the passage of molecules and cells. Its selective permeability facilitates the transport of essential nutrients, such as glucose via glucose transporters (GLUT1) and amino acids, while effectively excluding potentially neurotoxic substances. This ensures an optimal microenvironment for neuronal function and activity. As a neuroprotective barrier, the BBB prevents the entry of pathogens, toxins, and peripheral immune cells into the CNS, thus safeguarding against infections and inflammation. Additionally, the metabolic barrier function of the BBB involves enzymatic systems within brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) that degrade neuroactive compounds and xenobiotics, preventing their accumulation in the brain. The BBB also acts as a signaling interface, dynamically interacting with systemic and neuronal signals to regulate its permeability in response to various physiological and pathological stimuli. This adaptability is critical for responding to changes in the body’s metabolic state and protecting the CNS under stress conditions. Recent studies continue to enhance our understanding of these functions, highlighting the complexity and significance of the BBB in both health and disease.",

(C) Different mechanisms for BBB crossing",
        "The BBB is a highly selective semipermeable border of endothelial cells that protects the brain from potentially harmful substances in the bloodstream while regulating the transport of essential nutrients and molecules. Despite its critical role in maintaining CNS homeostasis, the BBB poses a significant challenge for delivering therapeutic agents to the brain. Recent advancements in nanobiotechnology have illuminated various mechanisms through which substances can traverse the BBB, facilitating innovative approaches to drug delivery (Fig. 3C).",
        "Among these mechanisms, paracellular transport, which occurs between adjacent endothelial cells, is tightly regulated by proteins such as claudins, occludins, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). Normally, this route is impermeable due to tight junctions, but hyperosmotic solutions like mannitol can temporarily shrink endothelial cells and create transient openings. This strategy enables drug delivery but carries risks of nonspecific permeability and neurotoxicity [37]. This underscores the need for precise and localized application.",
        "Another approach, transcellular lipophilic diffusion, allows small, lipophilic molecules to diffuse across endothelial cell membranes. The efficiency of this mechanism depends on a compound’s lipophilicity and molecular weight. For instance, the design of lipophilic prodrugs and molecular docking simulations has been instrumental in optimizing drug permeability [38]. However, challenges such as off-target effects necessitate careful design.",
        "Carrier-mediated transport (CMT) involves endogenous transport proteins like GLUT1 and amino acid transporters. These systems are hijacked by therapeutic agents conjugated with molecules recognized by these carriers. For example, GLUT1-targeted nanoparticles have been effective in delivering antineoplastic agents to glioblastomas, demonstrating the potential of this strategy [39]. Advances in synthetic biology continue to enhance carrier specificity and affinity.",
        "Similarly, receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) uses specific receptors on BBB endothelial cells to facilitate transport. Ligands such as transferrin, insulin, and low-density lipoprotein are commonly exploited in this context. Nanocarrier systems, functionalized with ligands or antibodies, have achieved effective BBB crossing, as seen in transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles [40]. Innovations like bispecific antibodies further improve targeting efficiency, exemplifying the synergy between molecular engineering and targeted delivery.",
        "Electrostatic interactions also play a role in adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT), where cationic molecules bind to the negatively charged surface of endothelial cells. Nanoparticles coated with polyethyleneimine (PEI) leverage this mechanism but require careful optimization to mitigate cytotoxicity and non-specific uptake [41]. These strategies illustrate the balance between efficacy and safety in AMT-based designs.",
        "Beyond molecular interactions, cellular-based transport strategies employ macrophages, stem cells, and leukocytes as “Trojan horses” to deliver therapeutic agents. These cells naturally traverse the BBB, providing a platform for nanoparticle or gene-editing tool delivery. Such approaches have shown promise in neurodegenerative disease treatment [42]. Cellular vehicles thus offer immunomodulation advantages alongside targeted drug delivery.",
        "Nanoparticles and exosomes represent versatile tools for BBB penetration due to their customizable properties. Exosomes, which are naturally occurring extracellular vesicles, exploit endogenous communication pathways to cross the BBB. Functionalizing exosomes with targeting peptides or antibodies enhance their delivery efficiency. Similarly, nanoparticles such as dendrimers and lipid-based carriers have been tailored to exploit multiple BBB-crossing mechanisms [43]. These innovations highlight the adaptability of nanotechnology.",
        "In addition to these strategies, focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles offers a non-invasive means to transiently disrupt the BBB. The cavitation effect of microbubbles under ultrasound stimulation creates temporary openings in tight junctions, enabling drug delivery without significant endothelial damage. Clinical trials using FUS for glioblastoma treatment have shown promising results [44]. Combining FUS with nanocarriers further enhances the precision and efficacy of this technique.",
        "Emerging research has also highlighted endogenous mechanisms such as extracellular vesicles and peptide shuttles. Vesicles secreted by brain endothelial cells can encapsulate therapeutic agents, while peptides derived from natural ligands like apolipoproteins mimic receptor interactions to facilitate transport [45]. These approaches offer a biomimetic solution, minimizing immune responses while enhancing delivery efficiency.",
        "Finally, pathological conditions like inflammation, tumors, and infections can be exploited to enhance drug delivery. For example, inflammatory mediators increase BBB permeability, allowing the delivery of larger molecules. Glioblastomas, with their leaky vasculature, permit selective targeting through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [46]. Such strategies underscore the potential of leveraging pathological states to overcome BBB challenges.",
        "The highly selective nature of the BBB poses formidable challenges for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the CNS. Although essential for neuroprotection, the barrier restricts the entry of many therapeutic molecules, including hydrophilic drugs and large biomolecules, thereby limiting treatment options for neurological disorders [47]. Drug physicochemical properties such as lipophilicity and molecular size play critical roles in determining BBB permeability, yet many advanced therapies, including proteins and gene-editing tools, fail to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the brain [48]. Efflux transporters such as P-gp further complicate drug delivery by actively expelling many molecules back into circulation, significantly reducing their bioavailability. While protective against toxins, these mechanisms represent a substantial bottleneck for CNS drug development [49].",
        "Neurological diseases themselves can alter the BBB, either exacerbating or complicating these challenges. Conditions like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and brain tumors are associated with structural and functional changes in the BBB. These alterations are often stage-dependent; for example, increased permeability in early-stage AD may allow the entry of therapeutic agents, but at the cost of homeostatic disruption, while advanced stages may see tighter barrier regulation, complicating drug delivery further [50].",
        "Traditional drug delivery routes, such as intravenous administration, are inherently limited in their ability to effectively target the CNS. Systemic delivery results in widespread distribution of therapeutic agents, often diluting their concentration at the brain while increasing the likelihood of off-target effects. This inefficiency significantly hampers therapeutic efficacy within the CNS. Intranasal drug delivery, which exploits direct anatomical pathways through the olfactory and trigeminal nerves to bypass the BBB, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, it faces persistent challenges, including limited efficiency, restricted payload capacity, and variability in patient response, highlighting the need for continued optimization [51].",
        "Emerging technologies such as nanoparticles and liposomal systems offer innovative approaches to overcome the restrictive nature of the BBB. Nanoparticles, capable of encapsulating drugs, shield therapeutic agents from systemic degradation and enhance permeability across the BBB. Similarly, liposomes, which mimic cell membranes, have shown considerable promise in transporting hydrophilic drugs into the brain. Despite these advantages, both systems face significant challenges, including instability, scalability issues for clinical use, and achieving specificity to target diseased brain regions without off-target effects [52].",
        "Biocompatibility and immunogenicity are critical obstacles for advanced drug delivery systems. Engineered carriers, such as nanoparticles and liposomes, are frequently identified by the immune system as foreign entities, leading to rapid clearance and inflammatory responses that reduce their efficacy. Efforts to mitigate immune recognition include surface modifications, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating, which can create a steric shield to evade immune detection. However, such modifications may also compromise the ability of these carriers to penetrate the BBB effectively, presenting a trade-off that necessitates careful optimization [53].",
        "Despite promising preclinical results, translating these innovative drug delivery methods into clinical practice remains a formidable challenge. Regulatory frameworks for nanomedicine are still evolving and often require comprehensive safety and efficacy evaluations, delaying clinical application. Manufacturing these advanced drug carriers at a scale suitable for widespread clinical use introduces additional hurdles, including maintaining stability and ensuring quality control. Furthermore, transitioning from laboratory research to clinical application requires the demonstration of both therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety, along with cost-effectiveness, posing further complexities in the development pipeline [54].",
        "The BBB is a highly selective and tightly regulated structure that effectively limits the passage of most therapeutic agents into the CNS. While this impermeability is essential for protecting the CNS, it presents significant challenges in the treatment of neurological diseases. Exosomes have emerged as a promising solution for overcoming the BBB due to their unique biological properties and inherent compatibility with physiological systems. Exosomes possess several intrinsic advantages that make them effective in traversing the BBB. These nanosized vesicles are naturally secreted by various cell types, including neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells of the BBB. Their endogenous origin allows exosomes to interact seamlessly with brain endothelial cells and other CNS components, eliciting minimal immune responses [55]. Additionally, the exosomal membrane is enriched with specialized surface proteins and lipids, such as tetraspanins and integrins, which facilitate interactions with receptors on BBB endothelial cells. These receptor-mediated processes, including endocytosis and transcytosis, enable efficient transport of exosomes across the BBB [56]. Surface modification of exosomes further enhances their ability to penetrate the BBB. For instance, Alvarez-Erviti et al. demonstrated that exosomes loaded with siRNA could effectively cross the BBB and deliver therapeutic cargo to neurons, validating their potential as targeted drug delivery systems for CNS disorders [57].",
        "The biocompatibility of exosomes, derived from their endogenous origin, represents a critical advantage over synthetic nanoparticles. Unlike synthetic carriers, exosomes exhibit minimal immunogenicity, making them suitable for repeated administration. This characteristic is particularly valuable in the management of chronic neurological diseases such as AD and PD, which require sustained therapeutic intervention [58]. Moreover, exosomes are capable of evading phagocytosis and clearance by the reticuloendothelial system, thereby prolonging their circulation time and enhancing their efficacy as drug carriers [59].",
        "Recent advancements in bioengineering have enabled the customization of exosomes to optimize their BBB penetration and therapeutic potential. Functionalization of the exosomal surface, such as the incorporation of brain-targeting ligands like transferrin or lactoferrin, significantly enhances their specificity and efficiency in BBB transport [60]. Additionally, genetic or biochemical modifications of donor cells can yield exosomes with tailored surface markers, improving their interaction with BBB endothelial cells and reducing off-target effects.",
        "Exosomes’ ability to carry diverse therapeutic payloads, including small molecules, proteins, RNA, and CRISPR/Cas9 components, sets them apart from traditional delivery systems. Their structure protects therapeutic cargo from enzymatic degradation in the bloodstream, ensuring that the payload reaches its CNS target intact [61]. In brain cancer therapy, for instance, exosomes have been employed to deliver chemotherapeutic agents across the BBB, achieving precise targeting of glioblastoma cells while sparing healthy tissue. This precision minimizes systemic toxicity and maximizes therapeutic efficacy [56].",
        "The transport of exosomes across the BBB leverages their unique biological properties and the specialized structure of the endothelial interface. Several distinct mechanisms facilitate this process, including receptor-mediated endocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, integrin interactions, fusion-mediated transport, and paracellular pathways (Fig. 4). Understanding these pathways in detail is critical for optimizing exosome-based drug delivery systems for neurological disorders [62].",
        "Fig. 4Mechanisms of Exosome Translocation Across the BBB",
        "Mechanisms of Exosome Translocation Across the BBB",
        "Receptor-mediated endocytosis plays a crucial role in exosome uptake at the BBB. Exosomal ligands such as integrins, tetraspanins, and heat shock proteins (HSPs) bind to specific receptors on endothelial cells, triggering vesicular internalization. The transferrin receptor (TfR) is one of the most widely studied receptors in this context, facilitating targeted exosome transport into the CNS [63]. Studies have demonstrated that surface modification of exosomes with TfR-binding peptides enhances their BBB permeability, significantly improving brain delivery of therapeutic cargo [60]. In addition to TfR, other receptors such as low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and insulin receptor (INSR) have been identified as potential mediators of exosome internalization. Studies suggest that exosome surface engineering with LDLR-binding ligands can further enhance BBB penetration, offering alternative pathways for brain-targeted therapies [64]. Furthermore, nanoparticle-functionalized exosomes have been developed to improve receptor-targeting efficiency, reducing off-target effects and enhancing CNS delivery [65]. The efficiency of receptor-mediated transcytosis also depends on ligand-receptor affinity and receptor recycling mechanisms, making the selection of optimal targeting moieties essential for successful therapeutic applications [66].",
        "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a major pathway facilitating exosome transcytosis across the BBB. This process relies on the formation of clathrin-coated pits that selectively engulf exosomes, allowing their intracellular trafficking and transport into the brain [67]. The TfR and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) play crucial roles in mediating exosome uptake via CME, ensuring efficient transport of exosome-bound molecules [65]. Upon ligand binding, clathrin-coated vesicles undergo dynamin-dependent scission from the plasma membrane, leading to the internalization of exosomes into early endosomes. These vesicles are subsequently trafficked to late endosomes or lysosomes for degradation or undergo sorting for transcytosis across endothelial cells [68]. Exosome surface markers, such as tetraspanins CD63 and CD81, have been shown to play an essential role in modulating interactions with clathrin-associated receptors, thereby enhancing selective uptake and transport across the BBB [69]. Beyond receptor-mediated interactions, studies suggest that HSP70 on exosome surfaces further influences their recognition by endothelial cells, enhancing clathrin-dependent transcytosis [70]. Additionally, exosomal interactions with LDLRs have been implicated in facilitating LDLR-clathrin interactions that promote vesicle trafficking across the endothelial layer [71].",
        "Studies in in vitro BBB models indicate that up to 10% of exosomes can successfully cross from the luminal to the abluminal chamber via clathrin-mediated transcytosis [72]. This highlights the efficiency of CME as a key pathway for extracellular vesicle transport across the BBB.",
        "Integrins play a pivotal role in exosome-mediated transport across the BBB, facilitating both receptor-mediated uptake and clathrin-independent pathways. Exosomes expressing integrin αvβ3 interact with vascular endothelial adhesion molecules, thereby enhancing their ability to traverse the endothelial layer by leveraging existing cellular adhesion pathways [73]. Recent studies have highlighted that integrin-expressing exosomes actively engage ECM components, facilitating BBB penetration without compromising its structural integrity. For instance, macrophage-derived exosomes equipped with integrins have been observed to efficiently cross the BBB and deliver therapeutic cargoes to neural tissues [74]. This process is further influenced by integrin signaling, which modulates endothelial permeability and enhances transcytosis efficiency [75]. Exosome transport across the BBB also involves molecular regulators such as milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8), which enhances integrin αvβ3-mediated exosomal trafficking through endothelial layers [76]. These mechanisms highlight the specificity of integrin-exosome interactions, underscoring their potential as therapeutic delivery vehicles and biomarkers for disease progression.",
        "Fusion-mediated transport is a critical mechanism that allows exosomes to bypass endosomal degradation, ensuring the intact delivery of their cargo across the BBB. This process involves direct membrane fusion between exosomes and endothelial cells, facilitated by lipid components such as phosphatidylserine, cholesterol, and sphingomyelin. The high fusogenic potential of exosomes is attributed to the presence of lipid rafts, which promote membrane curvature and fusion with target cells [77]. A key factor influencing fusion efficiency is the lipid composition of both the exosomal and endothelial membranes. Phosphatidylserine, for instance, plays a pivotal role in mediating the interaction between exosomes and recipient cells by engaging phosphatidylserine-recognizing receptors, such as TIM-4 and lactadherin, which facilitate docking and subsequent fusion [78]. Cholesterol-rich lipid rafts further enhance membrane fluidity, promoting efficient fusion events that drive cargo delivery into the cytoplasm of target cells [79]. Additionally, sphingomyelin contributes to membrane rigidity and helps stabilize the formation of fusion-competent domains, ensuring that exosomal contents are delivered without degradation [80]. Among the various pathways EVs utilize for BBB crossing, fusion-mediated transport is particularly advantageous as it circumvents lysosomal processing, which often degrades cargo before it reaches the cytoplasm [81]. Other pathways, such as receptor-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis, involve internalization into endosomes, where EVs risk degradation unless they successfully escape into the cytoplasm. In contrast, direct fusion allows for the immediate cytoplasmic release of bioactive molecules such as proteins, RNA, and lipids, increasing the efficiency of therapeutic cargo delivery [82].",
        "Comparative studies indicate that different EV subtypes exhibit varying propensities for fusion-mediated transport, depending on their lipid composition and surface protein expression. For instance, neural-derived exosomes exhibit enhanced fusion with endothelial cells due to the presence of neural adhesion molecules that facilitate targeted binding [83]. Additionally, artificially engineered exosomes with modified lipid compositions, such as increased phosphatidylserine content, have been shown to exhibit improved fusogenicity, highlighting the potential for optimizing fusion-mediated transport for therapeutic applications [84]. In addition to lipid composition, specialized proteins such as SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) and Rab GTPases facilitate membrane docking and fusion, ensuring the directed transport of exosomal cargo into the cytoplasm of target cells [85]. Recent studies indicate that modulating lipid raft dynamics and incorporating engineered fusogenic peptides can further enhance exosomal fusion efficiency [86]. This process not only optimizes therapeutic delivery but also enables exosome-mediated intercellular communication within the CNS, paving the way for novel neurotherapeutic strategies.",
        "The engineering of exosomes as precision delivery vehicles has revolutionized their therapeutic potential across diverse medical fields. By leveraging their inherent biocompatibility and ability to traverse biological barriers such as the BBB, researchers have devised innovative strategies to enhance exosome functionality for targeted drug delivery. Recent advancements in exosomal engineering can be categorized into genetic and biochemical modification techniques, drug-loading strategies, and brain-specific targeting mechanisms.",
        "Exosomes, by virtue of their biological compatibility and ability to cross barriers like the BBB, represent promising platforms for drug delivery. Engineering these vesicles through genetic and biochemical modifications has expanded their therapeutic potential, enabling precise cargo delivery, improved targeting specificity, and enhanced stability.",
        "Genetic engineering involves modifying exosome-producing cells to generate vesicles with desired properties. This approach leverages cellular machinery to express specific proteins, peptides, or ligands on the exosomal membrane or load therapeutic molecules into their lumen. Incorporating targeting ligands through genetic engineering has been a cornerstone of exosome-based innovations. A notable strategy involves expressing the rabies viral glycoprotein (RVG) peptide on exosomal membranes, enabling selective interaction with acetylcholine receptors on neuronal cells. For instance, Khongkow et al. demonstrated that RVG-engineered exosomes effectively crossed the BBB and delivered RNA therapeutics to neuronal targets, paving the way for neurodegenerative disease therapies [87]. Similarly, Jia et al. developed neuropilin-1-targeted exosomes by genetically modifying donor cells to express ligands that bind glioblastoma cells. These exosomes exhibited enhanced targeting of brain tumors in vivo, significantly improving therapeutic outcomes [88].",
        "Loading therapeutic cargo into exosomes by engineering donor cells has also proven highly efficient. For example, Alvarez-Erviti et al. successfully modified dendritic cells to produce exosomes carrying siRNA targeting the BACE1 gene, a critical player in AD. These exosomes traversed the BBB and silenced the target gene in neurons [25]. Similarly, CRISPR/Cas9 systems have been encapsulated in exosomes for genome editing. Duan et al. demonstrated that donor cells engineered to produce exosomes loaded with CRISPR/Cas9 targeting the PCSK9 gene achieved precise genome editing and significant therapeutic benefits in preclinical models [89].",
        "Genetically engineered exosomes have also been explored for cancer immunotherapy. Ke Si et al. developed exosomes that co-deliver paclitaxel (PTX) and programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1)-blocking Single-chain variable fragment (scFv), enhancing T-cell activation and reducing PD-L1-mediated immune suppression. These engineered exosomes demonstrated improved drug absorption and inhibited tumor growth, offering a promising strategy for cancer treatment [90].",
        "Biochemical modification techniques enhance the surface properties or cargo content of exosomes post-isolation, complementing genetic engineering by adding functionalities that cannot be achieved through cellular modifications alone. Surface functionalization through covalent or non-covalent bonding has significantly expanded the targeting capabilities of exosomes. For instance, dopamine-functionalized exosomes, created by conjugating dopamine molecules to exosomal surfaces, efficiently delivered therapeutic agents to dopaminergic neurons, offering potential in PD therapy [91]. Nanoparticle decoration is another promising approach, as demonstrated by Li et al., who developed a magnetic nanoparticle-exosome platform that enhances BBB penetration and tumor targeting, facilitating synergistic ferroptosis therapy through Fe3O₄-mediated Fe²⁺ release and ferroptosis defense axis disintegration [92]. Exosomes can also be modified through fusion with liposomes or synthetic vesicles, enabling the incorporation of additional functional molecules such as peptides, drugs, or contrast agents. Wang et al. developed biomimetic pHybrid nanovesicles by fusing blood exosomes with tLyp-1 peptide-modified liposomes, enhancing BBB penetration and facilitating synergistic glioma therapy through cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic effects [93]. Chemical conjugation techniques have also been employed to enhance exosome stability in circulation. For example, PEG conjugation prevents opsonization, prolonging circulation time. This modification is particularly advantageous for applications requiring repeated systemic administration, such as chronic neurodegenerative diseases [94].",
        "The therapeutic efficacy of exosomes as drug delivery platforms hinges on their capacity to effectively encapsulate therapeutic agents. This improves bioavailability, protects payloads from enzymatic degradation, and ensures targeted delivery to desired sites [95]. Two primary approaches—pre-loading and post-loading—determine the stage at which therapeutic molecules are introduced, while passive and active loading methods govern the mechanism of encapsulation. Table 2 represents a comparative overview of pre-loading and post-loading techniques for exosome drug loading, highlighting their principles, advantages, and limitations.",

        "Exosome drug loading methods",
        "Pre-loading involves the introduction of therapeutic molecules into exosomes during their biogenesis, prior to their release from parent cells. This process capitalizes on the natural ability of cells to incorporate agents such as miRs, siRNA, and mRNA through transfection or genetic engineering. Pre-loading ensures efficient encapsulation as therapeutic agents integrate into exosomes at the point of formation, resulting in homogeneous payload distribution [106]. Post-loading, by contrast, occurs after exosome isolation. Drugs are introduced into harvested exosomes using external techniques that manipulate the vesicle membrane [107]. Although this approach enables flexibility in selecting exosome sources and therapeutic payloads, loading efficiency, zeta potential, and size distribution can vary, influencing the stability and functionality of the exosomes [108].",
        "Passive loading relies on the natural ability of exosomes to incorporate therapeutic molecules during their biogenesis or through diffusion into their lipid bilayer. This method is particularly effective for small, hydrophobic molecules that can seamlessly integrate into the exosomal membrane.",
        "The inherent affinity of hydrophobic drugs for the lipid bilayer of exosomes makes passive diffusion a viable strategy. However, passive loading often suffers from limitations such as suboptimal encapsulation efficiency, particularly for molecules with low lipophilicity or larger molecular sizes. Payload leakage during purification and circulation further reduces therapeutic efficacy. These challenges underscore the need for more sophisticated and reliable active loading strategies [109]. Active loading methods utilize external physical or chemical forces to enhance the encapsulation of therapeutic agents into exosomes. These techniques address the limitations of passive loading by enabling the efficient incorporation of hydrophilic molecules, macromolecules, and genetic materials. Prominent active loading strategies include electroporation, sonication, extrusion, and emerging methods such as freeze-thaw cycles and chemical conjugation.",
        "Electroporation, one of the most widely used active loading techniques, employs short electrical pulses to create transient pores in the exosomal membrane, allowing therapeutic agents to diffuse into the vesicles. This method is particularly effective for loading genetic materials, such as siRNA, mRNA, and CRISPR/Cas9 components [110]. However, electroporation can cause aggregation of nucleic acids, potentially reducing their functional efficacy. Optimizing parameters such as pulse strength, duration, and solution conductivity is crucial for minimizing these effects.",
        "Sonication utilizes ultrasonic waves to temporarily disrupt the exosomal membrane, facilitating the encapsulation of therapeutic agents [111]. While sonication ensures uniform drug encapsulation and is scalable for clinical applications, prolonged exposure can damage exosome structure, affecting their biodistribution and targeting.",
        "Extrusion involves forcing a mixture of exosomes and therapeutic agents through nanoporous membranes under high pressure. This mechanical process achieves efficient and reproducible drug loading. Extrusion is highly scalable and suitable for industrial production. It also enables the encapsulation of larger therapeutic molecules, such as peptides and proteins. In contrast, the high-pressure process may alter the structural integrity of exosomes, necessitating post-loading characterization to ensure functionality [9].",
        "Novel active loading methods are emerging to address the limitations of traditional techniques. Freeze-thaw cycles create temporary membrane pores by subjecting exosomes to alternating freezing and thawing, allowing the encapsulation of therapeutic agents [112]. Chemical conjugation techniques, such as click chemistry, offer high specificity and stability for drug payloads [89]. Magnetic manipulation has also been explored, demonstrating that iron oxide nanoparticle-loaded exosomes could be guided to inflamed tissues using magnetic fields, enhancing targeted delivery [9].",
        "The BBB presents a formidable obstacle for therapeutic delivery to the CNS. Exosomes, with their innate biocompatibility and ability to traverse the BBB, have emerged as promising carriers for brain-targeted therapies. Strategies to enhance exosome specificity include surface functionalization, cell-derived targeting, and hybrid systems that integrate natural and synthetic components.",
        "Surface functionalization involves modifying exosomal membranes with ligands or molecules that enhance their interaction with CNS-specific targets. Transferrin ligands exploit TfR-mediated transcytosis to cross the BBB. For example, exosomes functionalized with transferrin ligands efficiently delivered chemotherapeutic agents to neuronal cells, significantly improving therapeutic outcomes in CNS oncology [113]. Similarly, exosomes engineered with neuropilin-1 ligands demonstrated superior targeting capabilities, reducing tumor growth in glioblastoma models [88]. Tian et al. further reported enhanced anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of curcumin (Cur)-loaded exosomes in ischemic stroke models following surface modification, with notable reductions in infarct size [114].",
        "Exosomes derived from specific CNS cell types, such as astrocytes or brain endothelial cells, possess inherent brain-targeting properties. Cao et al. demonstrated that brain endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles efficiently transport mitochondria-targeting photosensitizers across the BBB, enhancing photodynamic therapy efficacy and selectively inducing apoptosis in glioblastoma cells [115]. Astrocyte-derived exosomes have also been used to deliver genetic materials, such as siRNA, to neurons, showing promise in treating neurodegenerative conditions like AD and PD [116–118].",
        "Hybrid systems combine exosomes with synthetic nanoparticles or liposomes to enhance functionality and targeting precision. Khongkow et al. developed a hybrid system by conjugating exosomes with gold nanoparticles, achieving improved BBB penetration and brain targeting in neurodegenerative disease models [87]. Similarly, liposome-exosome hybrids have been shown to improve membrane stability and targeting accuracy. Liu et al. developed exosome-liposome hybrid-based vehicles labeled with near-infrared-II (NIR-II) fluorescence dyes, exhibiting strong light-harvesting capability, high photoconversion efficiency (62.28%), and effective tumor ablation in glioblastoma models [119].",
        "Exosome-based drug delivery systems represent a transformative approach to tackling CNS diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, brain tumors, and psychiatric conditions. Their ability to cross the BBB and inherent biocompatibility position them as promising tools for precision medicine in neurology.",
        "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS) pose significant therapeutic challenges due to the progressive nature of neuronal damage and the impermeability of the BBB. Exosome-based therapies offer innovative solutions to overcome these barriers and address underlying pathologies.",
        "AD, the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Traditional drug therapies, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, often provide symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology, and their efficacy is limited by their inability to cross the BBB efficiently [120]. In contrast, exosome-based therapies present a paradigm shift by offering targeted delivery of therapeutic agents and early intervention strategies.",
        "RNA-based exosome therapies have been particularly effective in modulating amyloidogenesis pathways. Jahangard et al. developed exosomes transfected with miR-29b using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). These exosomes successfully delivered miR-29b to target cells, significantly enhancing miR-29b expression and inhibiting amyloidogenic pathways in Aβ-induced mouse models. Bilateral administration improved hippocampal learning, underscoring their therapeutic potential [121]. Yang et al. highlighted the advantages of exosomes derived from human MSCs cultured under 3D conditions compared to two-dimensional (2D) cultures. Exosomes from 3D cultures exhibited elevated levels of neprilysin (NEP), HSP70, and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which promote Aβ degradation. APP/PS1 mouse models treated with these exosomes demonstrated reduced amyloid plaque burden and improved memory and cognitive function [122].",
        "Despite their ability to cross the BBB, exosome therapeutics face challenges related to off-target accumulation in non-brain organs, such as the liver and spleen. Recent advancements in engineering brain-specific exosome targeting address this limitation. RVG-conjugated exosomes have demonstrated strong affinity for acetylcholine receptors, facilitating their uptake into neuronal cells. In AD models, these exosomes reduced Aβ plaques, inhibited glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) production, and improved hippocampal and cortical functions by modulating neuroinflammation and enhancing spatial memory [123].",
        "Drug-loaded exosomes represent another promising approach. Wang et al. developed macrophage-derived exosomes loaded with Cur for AD treatment. These exosomes crossed the BBB via active transport mediated by lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) integrins binding to Intercellular adhesion molecule 1(ICAM-1)and localized with hippocampal neurons. They reduced neuronal apoptosis, inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation via the AKT/GSK-3β pathway, and enhanced cognitive function in AD models [124]. Similarly, plasma-derived exosomes loaded with quercetin (Que) demonstrated improved cognitive performance in okadaic acid (OA)-induced AD mice. These exosomes reduced tau phosphorylation through cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) suppression, minimized neurofibrillary tangle formation, and decreased caspase-3/9 activity, emphasizing their neuroprotective potential [125]. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)-loaded exosomes derived from human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) have also demonstrated efficacy. In a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD rat model, CoQ10-loaded exosomes improved spatial memory, increased hippocampal neuron density, and elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and SRY-related HMG-box 2 (SOX2) expression, highlighting their role in neuroprotection and neurogenesis [126]. Exosome-like liposomes have emerged as complementary systems. Fernandes et al. investigated Cur-loaded liposomes in zebrafish embryos and human neuronal cells. These liposomes reduced oxidative stress by 50%, promoting neuroprotection while minimizing adverse effects. Although further validation in mature organisms is needed, these findings suggest potential synergy between liposome-based and exosome-mediated approaches [127].",
        "Exosome-based therapeutics are rapidly evolving, with ongoing efforts to enhance brain-specific targeting and mitigate off-target effects. Advanced engineering techniques, such as peptide conjugation and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, are opening new frontiers for precision medicine. For instance, CRISPR-Cas9 delivered via exosomes has shown potential to correct genetic defects, such as ApoE4-associated mutations, offering novel approaches to treating AD [128]. Further, engineered exosomes with a photoinducible protein delivery system, termed MAPLEX, enable precise epigenome editing in AD models. MAPLEX utilizes mMaple3-mediated protein loading and blue-light-induced cargo release, allowing targeted delivery of gene-editing tools like dead Cas9 (dCas9) ribonucleoprotein complexes. In amyloid precursor protein transgenic (5xFAD) and triple-transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse models of AD, MAPLEX-based delivery of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (Bace1)-targeting single guide RNA resulted in reduced amyloid plaque formation and improved cognitive function. This innovative platform highlights exosomes as promising therapeutic nanocarriers for neurodegenerative diseases [129].",
        "Integrating exosomes with established therapeutics, like aducanumab, could amplify treatment efficacy by ensuring BBB penetration and sustained drug release. Additionally, combining exosomes with neurotrophic factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines may restore synaptic density, reduce neuroinflammation, and improve cognitive functions, further expanding the therapeutic arsenal for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",
        "PD is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the pathological aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) proteins. This neurodegenerative disorder manifests with hallmark motor symptoms, including bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. Traditional pharmacological therapies, such as levodopa and dopamine agonists, focus on symptom management rather than addressing disease progression. Furthermore, their efficacy diminishes over time due to side effects, including motor complications and systemic toxicity [130]. Recent advancements in nanobiotechnology, including exosome-mediated delivery systems, present innovative therapeutic strategies for overcoming these limitations and enabling early diagnosis and intervention.",
        "The pathological aggregation of α-Syn plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Exosome-based RNA therapies have shown significant promise in targeting α-Syn. Izco et al. demonstrated that exosomes loaded with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) effectively reduced α-Syn aggregation, protected dopaminergic neurons, and alleviated PD symptoms in preclinical models. These shRNA-loaded exosomes exhibited stable delivery across the BBB, ensuring controlled release and minimizing systemic degradation [131]. Similarly, Cooper et al. utilized RVG-modified exosomes to deliver siRNA targeting α-Syn transcripts. In PD mouse models, these siRNA-loaded exosomes reduced α-Syn accumulation in the substantia nigra, improved motor functions, and underscored the therapeutic potential of RNA-based exosome therapies [132].",
        "Exosome-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 components represents an innovative approach to addressing genetic contributors to PD. Exosome-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 components represents an innovative approach to addressing genetic contributors to PD. Recent research by Weirong Kong et al. demonstrated an epigenetic regulation platform using exosomal CRISPR intervention. FUS facilitated the delivery of engineered exosomes (RVG-CRISPRi-Exo) into brain lesions, inducing specific methylation of SNCA (α-synuclein gene). This approach significantly improved motor performance, reduced α-synuclein levels, and rescued neuronal damage in PD mice. These findings highlight the potential of targeted brain nanodelivery in neurodegenerative diseases [133].",
        "Dopamine (DA) replacement remains a cornerstone of PD treatment. Exosome-based delivery systems have demonstrated the ability to enhance the efficacy of this approach. Qu et al. engineered blood-derived exosomes to deliver DA across the BBB by incorporating transferrin ligands on their surface, enhancing targeting to dopaminergic neurons. In vivo studies reported a 15-fold increase in brain DA levels compared to free DA administration, restoring dopaminergic function and reducing oxidative stress in PD models. Neurobehavioral improvements and elevated striatal tyrosine hydroxylase levels further supported the therapeutic potential of DA-loaded exosomes [134].",

Kojima et al. developed EXOtic constructs to engineer exosomes for delivering catalase mRNA to inflamed brain regions (Fig. 5). These catalase-loaded exosomes reduced oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory markers, such as GFAP and TNF-α, in PD models. Immunostaining revealed localized neuroprotection, highlighting the role of exosome-based mRNA therapies in mitigating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced neurotoxicity [135]. Ren et al. further developed RVG-exosomes loaded with aptamer F5R2 to selectively target α-Syn fibrils (Fig. 6).

        "A recent study by Huang et al. demonstrated the therapeutic potential of intranasally administered umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSCs)-derived exosomes in a PD mouse model. The study found that UC-MSCs-derived exosomes successfully crossed the BBB, were endocytosed by neuronal and glial cells, and significantly improved both motor and non-motor functions in PD models. Additionally, UC-MSCs-derived exosomes exhibited neuroprotective effects by mitigating dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta and enhancing olfactory bulb neuronal activity. Furthermore, the treatment reduced neuroinflammation by suppressing microglial and astrocyte activation, improving the local brain microenvironment. These findings provide compelling evidence for the potential clinical application of exosome-based nanotherapeutics in PD treatment [138].",
        "These approaches, spanning RNA therapies, gene editing, DA replacement, and anti-inflammatory strategies, offer immense potential to mitigate PD progression and improve patient outcomes. However, further clinical studies are needed to optimize these therapies and translate them into viable treatments.",
        "Huntington’s disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative condition caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, leading to the production of toxic mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). This protein forms aggregates that disrupt cellular processes, causing progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms. Although the genetic mutation underlying HD was identified in 1993, disease-modifying treatments remain elusive. Current pharmacological therapies, such as tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine, provide symptomatic relief but do not address the underlying pathology or alter disease progression. Moreover, these treatments are associated with side effects, including sedation, depression, and motor disturbances [139]. Exosome-mediated drug delivery offers an innovative solution for crossing the BBB and delivering targeted therapeutics to the brain, addressing the limitations of traditional approaches.",
        "Exosomes have been extensively studied as carriers for siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to target mHTT transcripts and reduce mutant protein production. Wu et al. investigated neuron-specific RVG-modified exosomes loaded with siRNA targeting human mutant huntingtin (HuHtt) mRNA in two HD mouse models, BACHD and N171-82Q. Intravenous administration reduced HTT expression by 46% and 54% in these models, respectively. Treated N171-82Q mice showed significant motor coordination improvements in rotarod tests, underscoring the potential of siRNA-loaded exosomes for silencing mHTT and improving disease outcomes [140]. Didiot et al. enhanced siRNA stability and uptake by using hydrophobically engineered siRNAs (hsiRNAs) encapsulated in exosomes. Cholesterol-conjugated hsiRNAs significantly reduced HTT mRNA levels in cortical and striatal regions by approximately 35%. Free hsiRNAs were far less effective, emphasizing the importance of exosomes in facilitating efficient BBB delivery and gene silencing [141].",
        "ASOs provide another promising tool for targeting mHTT transcripts. These molecules bind complementary mRNA sequences, promoting degradation or blocking translation. Lee et al. demonstrated that miRNA-124-loaded exosomes reduced the expression of repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST), implicated in HD pathology. Although a single injection did not significantly improve motor function, this study highlighted the potential of optimizing dosing strategies or exploring alternative miRNAs, such as miR-9 and miR-125b, for therapeutic efficacy [142].",
        "Exosomes can be applied for delivering CRISPR-Cas9 systems to achieve allele-specific editing of mHTT. This approach might allow permanent genome modification, selectively targeting the mutant allele while sparing the wild-type HTT allele to minimize off-target effects. In addition to gene silencing, exosomes can be evaluated for delivering autophagy-enhancing molecules to facilitate the clearance of toxic mHTT aggregates. Combination therapies leveraging exosomes to co-deliver siRNAs and autophagy inducers might show synergistic benefits. This dual approach probably accelerate mHTT clearance, improves neuronal survival, and mitigates HD pathology.",
        "ALS and MS are devastating neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive motor dysfunction and immune-mediated demyelination, respectively. Despite significant advancements, current therapeutic strategies remain palliative, highlighting the urgent need for novel treatment modalities.",
        "Traditional treatment strategies for ALS and MS primarily focus on symptom management rather than disease modification. For ALS, FDA-approved drugs such as riluzole and edaravone offer limited efficacy, only slightly prolonging survival and reducing oxidative stress, respectively. MS treatments include immunomodulatory drugs like interferon-beta and monoclonal antibodies such as natalizumab, which help mitigate relapses and slow disease progression. However, these approaches do not reverse neuronal damage and may come with severe side effects, including immune suppression and infection risk.",
        "Exosome-based drug delivery has emerged as a promising alternative due to its ability to cross the BBB, carry neuroprotective cargo, and mediate immune modulation. Unlike traditional therapies, exosomes can deliver targeted treatments, reducing systemic toxicity while enhancing therapeutic efficacy. Their natural biocompatibility and ability to transfer bioactive molecules, including miRNAs and proteins, provide a novel mechanism to promote neuroregeneration and modulate inflammation directly at the site of injury.",
        "Exosomes derived MSCs have demonstrated potent neuroprotective effects by transferring bioactive molecules such as miRNAs, proteins, and lipids to neural cells. For instance, a study by Gschwendtberger et al. showed that exosomal delivery of neurotrophic factors significantly reduced neurotoxicity in ALS motor neurons [143]. In MS, excessive neuroinflammation contributes to demyelination and neuronal damage. Exosome-based therapies can modulate the immune system by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting regulatory T-cell responses. Ojeda-Hernández et al. highlighted the role of engineered exosomes in reducing neuroinflammation and promoting remyelination [144].",
        "Exosomes possess inherent capabilities to cross the BBB, making them ideal carriers for drug delivery. A study by Bonafede et al. demonstrated that hADSCs-exosomes successfully reached neuronal targets and improved motor function in ALS mice [145]. Recent studies have focused on exosomal therapy for ALS by delivering neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory molecules. Wang et al. demonstrated that exosomes derived hADSCs attenuated motor neuron degeneration by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation [146]. Another promising approach involves Schwann cell-derived exosomes. A case report by Goldschmidt-Clermont and Khan showed that administration of these exosomes through the FDA’s Expanded Access Program resulted in notable symptomatic relief in an ALS patient [147]. More recently, Mazzini et al. reviewed the latest preclinical advancements using stem cells and their translation into clinical trials of ALS, emphasizing the role of exosome-derived therapies [148]. Furthermore, the FDA recently cleared Aruna Bio’s exosome-based therapy AB126 for clinical trials in ALS, as reported by Ciccone, marking a significant step toward clinical application [149].",
        "Brain tumors, especially, glioblastoma represent some of the most formidable challenges in oncology due to their aggressive progression, invasive behavior, and the significant obstacles posed by the BBB to therapeutic delivery.

        "The utility of exosomes in brain tumor treatment",
        "Exosomes have demonstrated exceptional promise as carriers for chemotherapeutic agents, enabling deeper tumor penetration while reducing systemic toxicity. Unlike traditional drug delivery methods, exosome-mediated transport permits therapeutic compounds to bypass the BBB and accumulate effectively at tumor sites. Their lipid bilayer not only shields therapeutic agents from enzymatic degradation but also minimizes clearance by the immune system, thereby enhancing both drug stability and bioavailability. Engineered exosomes loaded with chemotherapeutic agents such as PTX and DOX have exhibited improved efficacy in preclinical glioblastoma models. For instance, research has shown that these exosomes significantly inhibit tumor growth while mitigating the systemic side effects typical of conventional chemotherapy [161]. Notably, exosomes derived from brain endothelial cells were employed to deliver PTX and DOX across the BBB in zebrafish glioblastoma models, achieving superior drug accumulation in brain tissues and greater cytotoxic effects against glioma cells compared to free-form drugs [56].",
        "Recent innovations have centered on functionalizing exosomes to enhance the targeting and efficacy of chemotherapeutics. For example, exosomes engineered with neuropilin-1-targeting peptides have demonstrated increased tumor specificity and improved delivery efficiency [88]. Similarly, embryonic stem cell-derived exosomes modified with Cyclo (Arg-Gly‐Asp‐D‐Tyr‐Lys) peptide (c(RGDyK)) and loaded with PTX have shown enhanced targeting and antitumor effects in glioblastoma. These engineered exosomes exhibit superior drug delivery compared to free PTX, improving therapeutic outcomes in both in vitro and in vivo GBM models [162]. These findings underscore the transformative potential of the exosome-based delivery systems in redefining chemotherapy for glioblastoma. Exosomes are increasingly being integrated with complementary therapeutic modalities to optimize their efficacy. For instance, exosomes functionalized with ginsenoside Rg3 have been employed to co-deliver chemotherapeutics and amplify anti-tumor immune responses, effectively suppressing glioblastoma progression in preclinical settings [163]. These developments highlight the adaptability of exosomes as versatile drug delivery platforms capable of overcoming the inherent limitations of traditional chemotherapy.",
        "In addition to chemotherapeutics, RNA-based therapies such as siRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs are emerging as promising tools to address the genetic and molecular underpinnings of glioblastoma. Exosomes offered an ideal vehicle for these fragile molecules, safeguarding them from enzymatic degradation and facilitating their efficient transport to tumor cells. Exosomes offered an ideal vehicle for these fragile molecules, safeguarding them from enzymatic degradation and facilitating their efficient transport to tumor cells. Shan et al. developed a macrophage-derived exosome-based nanodrug delivery system (cEM@DEP-siRNA) to enhance the therapeutic efficacy against diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). These exosomes were functionalized with a cyclic RGD (cRGD) peptide, which specifically binds to integrin αVβ3, a protein highly expressed on diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) cells, facilitating targeted drug delivery. The engineered exosomes successfully traversed the BBB, allowing for the efficient co-delivery of panobinostat and PPM1D (Protein Phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2 + Dependent 1D)-targeting siRNA (Fig. 7). This dual-therapy approach inhibited tumor cell proliferation and prolonged survival in DIPG animal models. The biomimetic design of exosome membranes provided superior biocompatibility, prolonged circulation time, and reduced systemic toxicity. This study highlights exosomes as a powerful drug delivery platform, offering a promising avenue for improving DIPG treatment outcomes​ [164].",

        "The therapeutic application of miRNAs within exosomes has been particularly noteworthy in glioblastoma research. For instance, Munoz et al. demonstrated that MSC-derived exosomes could effectively deliver functional anti-miR-9 to glioblastoma cells, conferring chemosensitivity. glioblastoma cells resistant to temozolomide (TMZ) exhibited increased miR-9 expression, which regulated P-glycoprotein, a drug efflux transporter. The transfer of anti-miR-9 via MSC-derived microvesicles reversed multidrug transporter expression, increasing caspase activity and promoting cell death. This study highlights exosome-mediated miRNA therapy as a promising strategy to overcome glioblastoma chemoresistance​ [154]. Similarly, exosomes loaded with miR-21 inhibitors have successfully reduced tumor proliferation and enhanced chemotherapy sensitivity [165]. By targeting molecular pathways implicated in angiogenesis, immune evasion, and drug resistance, these exosomes contribute to a less favorable microenvironment for tumor development. Emerging studies have also highlighted the potential of exosomal circRNAs in glioblastoma therapy. For example, exosomal circRNA 0001445 has been identified as a pivotal regulator of glioblastoma progression, suggesting new therapeutic directions in targeting circRNAs [166]. Furthermore, exosomes engineered to deliver siRNAs targeting VEGF pathways have demonstrated promise in suppressing angiogenesis and tumor growth, thereby advancing RNA-based glioblastoma treatment strategies [56].",
        "In another strategy, an exosome-membrane (EM) and polymer-based hybrid complex has been developed for the systemic delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene. This approach overcomes the challenge of pDNA penetration through the BBB by utilizing histidine/arginine-linked polyamidoamine (PHR) as a carrier, which binds to pDNA via electrostatic interactions. The hybrid complex, decorated with a T7 peptide for glioblastoma targeting, enhances transfection efficiency, leading to higher HSVtk expression and apoptosis levels in tumors, making it a promising gene therapy strategy [167].",
        "The advent of gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 has further expanded the therapeutic possibilities for glioblastoma, with exosomes serving as a powerful delivery mechanism. Exosomes offer distinct advantages for gene-editing applications, including non-immunogenicity, precision targeting, and efficient BBB penetration. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential of exosome-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 delivery. For instance, radiotherapy remains a cornerstone of glioblastoma treatment. However, therapeutic resistance limits its efficacy, necessitating additional strategies. Recent studies employed in vivo loss-of-function genome-wide CRISPR screens in orthotopic tumor models under radiation treatment to identify synthetic lethal genes associated with radiotherapy. One such study highlighted glutathione synthetase (GSS) as a key regulator of radioresistance through ferroptosis suppression. High GSS levels correlated with poor prognosis and relapse in glioma patients. Mechanistically, GSS depletion disrupted glutathione synthesis, inactivated GPX4, and caused iron accumulation, amplifying radiotherapy-induced ferroptosis. To address delivery challenges, the study introduced an innovative genome editing system where CRISPR/Cas9 complexes were loaded into EVs modified with Angiopep-2 (Ang) and TAT peptides (Fig. 8). This dual modification allowed the EVs to cross the BBB and target glioblastoma tissue effectively. These EVs achieved remarkable GSS gene editing efficiency in glioblastoma (up to 67.2%) with minimal off-target effects, demonstrating the feasibility of combining unbiased genetic screens and CRISPR-Cas9-based gene therapy for identifying therapeutic targets and overcoming radioresistance [168]. This study underscores the promise of integrating CRISPR/Cas9 with exosome-mediated delivery systems to enhance glioblastoma treatment outcomes.",

        "IS and TBI rank among the leading causes of long-term neurological disability, affecting millions globally. The complexity of these conditions, compounded by the challenges of delivering therapeutic agents across the BBB, has spurred significant interest in exosome-based interventions. Exosomes offer unparalleled advantages by enabling the targeted delivery of neuroprotective and regenerative biomolecules while bypassing the BBB and minimizing off-target effects.",
        "Current clinical therapeutic methods for IS commonly include drug therapy, such as thrombolytic and neuroprotective drugs, and intravascular stent therapy. While these treatments have proven beneficial, they have limited efficacy and potential side effects. Over the years, exosome-based therapies have emerged as a promising option in the treatment of IS, and their combination with existing therapies could reduce the side effects associated with drug and stent treatments. Research in this area is ongoing, and it appears that exosome-based therapies could open doors to innovative treatment options that could offer more effective and safer alternatives for IS patients. Exosome-based therapies could be a crucial step in advancing the clinical management of IS. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is one of the most widely used thrombolytic drugs for the treatment of ischemic stroke. tPA is responsible for converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then degrades fibrin, facilitating the dissolution of blood clots. The therapeutic efficacy of tPA is limited, however, by its potential to cause intracerebral hemorrhage when it crosses the BBB and enters brain parenchyma [169]. Researchers have attempted to address this issue by using exosomes as carriers for tPA, ensuring that the drug is delivered directly to the thromboembolic site, thereby reducing the risk of hemorrhagic complications. Khalil and Kanapathipillai developed an exosome-coated tPA nanoformulation, Exo-tPA, which demonstrated superior stability compared to free tPA. The encapsulation of tPA within exosomes also reduced the likelihood of tPA penetration into the brain parenchyma, mitigating the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and enhancing the overall therapeutic efficacy [170].",
        "Neuroprotective drugs play a crucial role in managing stroke, particularly in cases where the thrombolysis window has passed, and the patient is no longer eligible for tPA therapy. Edaravone is a neuroprotective drug that has been widely used to mitigate the damage caused by oxidative stress following ischemia and hypoxia. However, edaravone has limitations, including its short half-life, poor BBB penetration, and low bioavailability [171]. To address these challenges, Li et al. used macrophage-derived exosomes to load edaravone (Exo + Edv). Their research demonstrated that edaravone-loaded exosomes exhibited improved brain targeting, enhanced bioavailability, and reduced neuronal damage [172]. Additionally, the use of plasma-derived exosomes has been shown to enhance edaravone’s therapeutic effects by improving its ability to cross the BBB and targeting brain cells more effectively [173]. These findings indicate that exosome-based drug delivery systems offer significant potential in enhancing the efficacy of neuroprotective therapies for ischemic stroke. In addition to pharmacological therapies, mechanical therapies such as intravascular stenting are commonly used in the treatment of ischemic stroke, particularly in cases of large-vessel occlusion. While stenting is effective in restoring blood flow, the risk of in-stent restenosis, which occurs when the blood vessel narrows again after stent implantation, remains a major concern. Traditional drug-eluting stents have been developed to reduce restenosis, but the use of these stents can delay endothelial healing and increase the risk of late-stage restenosis [174]. Exosomes are now being investigated as potential candidates for coating stents due to their ability to promote endothelial growth, reduce inflammation, and enhance angiogenesis. Exosomes derived from MSCs have shown great promise in preventing in-stent restenosis. Studies have shown that MSC-derived exosomes contain various bioactive molecules, including miRNAs and proteins, that can promote vascular repair and endothelial regeneration [175]. Moreover, exosomes are advantageous because they can be loaded with multiple drugs, including anti-inflammatory and angiogenic agents, which work together to enhance the therapeutic effects. Recently, Hu et al. developed an innovative bioresponsive exosome-eluting stent that releases exosomes in response to ROS generated during ischemia-reperfusion injury. This system improved endothelial cell regeneration and reduced the risk of restenosis compared to traditional drug-eluting stents. The potential of exosomes to serve as drug-eluting coatings for stents may lead to improved outcomes in the management of ischemic stroke [174]. One of the limitations of exosome-based therapies is their inability to specifically target ischemic lesion sites, which reduces their therapeutic efficacy. To overcome this, researchers are exploring various strategies to enhance the targeting capabilities of exosomes. Genetic engineering is one of the most widely used approaches, where targeting peptides or proteins are fused to the surface of exosomes to direct them to specific cells or tissues. For example, Alvarez-Erviti et al. demonstrated that fusing the RVG to exosomes allowed them to specifically target neurons in the brain, improving the efficacy of gene delivery in an animal model of ischemic stroke [25]. Similarly, other studies have used genetically engineered exosomes to deliver siRNAs and miRNAs to target ischemic lesions and promote neuroprotection [176, 177]. These approaches have shown promising results in preclinical studies. Chemical modification techniques are another strategy used to improve exosome targeting. One such method involves conjugating peptides, such as the RGD peptide, to the surface of exosomes. The RGD peptide binds to integrins on the surface of cerebral vascular endothelial cells in ischemic brain regions, enhancing the delivery of therapeutic exosomes to the target site. Tian et al. demonstrated that RGD-functionalized exosomes exhibited enhanced targeting of ischemic brain tissue and promoted neuroprotection in a mouse model of stroke [178]. Other targeting strategies, such as the use of mannose-conjugated exosomes, have been developed to specifically target microglia, which play an essential role in the immune response during stroke [179]. Chemical modification techniques are not only cost-effective but also more suitable for large-scale production, making them highly attractive for clinical application. Magnetic targeting is another innovative strategy to enhance exosome delivery to ischemic lesions. Iron oxide nanoparticles can be loaded into exosomes, and an external magnetic field can be applied to guide the exosomes to the target site. This method has been shown to improve the targeting and retention of therapeutic exosomes in ischemic brain tissue, further enhancing their therapeutic effects [180]. While magnetic targeting holds great promise, its application may be limited by the complexity of human anatomy, and further research is needed to optimize this technique for clinical use.",
        "TBI represents a multifaceted therapeutic challenge due to its dual-phase pathology. Primary injuries involve direct mechanical trauma, while secondary injuries encompass delayed processes such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and BBB disruption. Exosome-based therapies hold immense promise in mitigating these processes by delivering targeted molecular payloads, modulating neuroinflammation, and promoting neural regeneration [181]. Neuroinflammation serves as a double-edged sword in TBI recovery, offering initial protective mechanisms but potentially exacerbating damage through prolonged inflammation. Exosomes, particularly those derived from MSCs, effectively modulate this response by reducing the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) and upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10. In a weight-drop-induced TBI rat model, intracerebroventricular microinjection of hADSC-derived exosomes promoted functional recovery by suppressing neuroinflammation, reducing neuronal apoptosis, and increasing neurogenesis. These exosomes were primarily taken up by microglia/macrophages, inhibiting their activation through NFκB and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, ultimately facilitating brain repair and recovery [182]. Furthermore, neural stem cell-derived exosomes have shown unique benefits in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Zhong et al. highlighted their role in attenuating microglial activation, further emphasizing their neuroprotective potential (Fig. 9) [183].",
        "The use of miRNAs within exosomes has gained significant attention for their ability to regulate gene expression in injured neural tissue. In the context of repetitive mild TBI, microglial exosomal miR-124-3p plays a crucial role in alleviating neurodegeneration and improving cognitive outcomes. exosomal miR-124-3p targets Rela, an inhibitory transcription factor of ApoE, thereby enhancing β-amyloid clearance and reducing neurodegeneration. Intravenously injected exosomal miR-124-3p is taken up by hippocampal neurons, leading to cognitive improvements, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disorders.",
        "Besides, incorporating exosomes into biocompatible scaffolds has emerged as a novel approach to prolong their therapeutic presence at injury sites. Hajinejad et al. investigated the efficacy of a cell-free-based therapy strategy using exosomes derived from human neural stem cells and a novel nano-scaffold in rats subjected to TBI. Their findings demonstrated that exosomes in combination with a 3D nano-scaffold containing a bio-motif of (stromal cell-derived factor 1α ) SDF1α (Nano-SDF) significantly decreased oxidative stress, reduced neuroinflammatory responses, and promoted neurogenesis in the sub-ventricular zone of the lateral ventricle. The study further revealed that exosomes with Nano-SDF suppressed the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 and its downstream signaling pathway, including NF-kβ and IL-1β, thereby mitigating reactive gliosis at the injury site. These findings suggest that a cell-free-based therapy strategy leveraging exosomes and Nano-SDF could serve as a promising treatment approach for TBI [184].",
        "Fig. 9A schematic representation illustrates the potential mechanisms through which exosomes secreted by neural stem cells (NSCs) contribute to the therapeutic effects of TBI. These exosomes, rich in bioactive molecules, can freely cross the BBB, suppress neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, and enhance neuroregeneration and angiogenesis. In terms of neuroregeneration, NSCs release exosomes containing circAcbd6, which facilitates the differentiation of NSCs into cholinergic neurons via the miR-320-5p/oxysterol-binding protein–related protein 2 axis. Additionally, NSC-derived exosomes modulate immune responses by reducing inflammation, suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6, and shifting microglial polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Regarding anti-apoptotic effects, NSC-derived exosomes deliver miR-150-3p, a microRNA that effectively inhibits neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, these exosomes enhance the expression of autophagy marker proteins LC3B and beclin-1, which contributes to reducing nerve cell apoptosis.

        "Psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia frequently involve disruptions in neurochemical pathways, inflammation, and impaired neurogenesis—key therapeutic targets for exosome-based strategies. Liu et al. explored a novel approach for treating major depressive disorder (MDD) by engineering RVG-modified exosomes to overexpress BDNF (RVG-BDNF-Exos). These exosomes effectively crossed the BBB, delivering BDNF directly to neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In a mouse model of depression, RVG-BDNF-Exos significantly increased BDNF levels, modulated the BDNF/TrkB/AKT signaling pathway, and improved depressive-like behaviors. The treatment also reduced neuroinflammation by decreasing microglial and astrocyte numbers while enhancing neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, as indicated by elevated expression of neuronal markers MAP2 and DCX and synaptic proteins PSD95 and Syn-1. These findings highlight the potential of serum exosomal BDNF as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target for MDD, paving the way for personalized psychiatric treatments [185]. Additionally, recent research by Huang et al. has demonstrated that hippocampal exosomes derived from stroke models may exacerbate post-stroke depression (PSD) by altering key neurobiological mechanisms. In their study, injection of hippocampal exosomes from stroke significantly worsened depressive-like behaviors in mice, as evidenced by behavioral tests such as sugar water preference, open field, and forced swim tests. These exosomes increased the expression of depression-associated proteins, including proBDNF and p75NTR, while simultaneously decreasing synapse-associated proteins such as Synaptotagmin and PSD95. Furthermore, Golgi staining revealed a notable reduction in dendritic spine density following treatment with these exosomes. These findings suggest that hippocampal exosomes from stroke contribute to PSD progression by modulating neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, highlighting their potential as both diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for PSD [186]. Furthermore, inflammation has emerged as a significant contributor to psychiatric disorders. Exosomes enriched with anti-inflammatory miRNAs, including miR-124 and miR-146a, have demonstrated the ability to reduce neuroinflammation and alleviate behavioral deficits in rodent models of depression and schizophrenia [187, 188]. Rare neurological diseases, such as Niemann-Pick and Gaucher’s diseases, lysosomal storage defects drive progressive neurodegeneration [189]. Exosomes offer an innovative solution for delivering therapeutic enzymes and genetic treatments across the BBB. Conventional enzyme replacement therapies are typically ineffective in treating CNS symptoms due to their inability to cross the BBB. However, exosome-based delivery systems have been shown to transport therapeutic enzymes directly to neuronal lysosomes, thereby correcting metabolic defects in preclinical models of Niemann-Pick and Gaucher’s diseases [190, 191].",
        "Exosomes are also being explored as carriers for CRISPR/Cas9 systems to address genetic mutations underlying orphan neurological conditions. In preclinical models of Rett syndrome, exosome-mediated delivery of CRISPR systems successfully restored MECP2 expression, resulting in symptomatic improvement [192].",
        "While exosome-mediated therapies hold immense potential, their transition from laboratory research to clinical practice faces significant challenges. These hurdles include preclinical validation, immune compatibility, and the complexities of regulatory approvals and manufacturing scalability. Below, we explore the progress and obstacles associated with the clinical translation of exosome-based therapies.",
        "Although most exosome-based treatments remain in the preclinical phase, early clinical trials have yielded promising results, showcasing their safety, efficacy, and translational potential for neurological disorders. These advancements underline the growing feasibility of exosomes as therapeutic tools for CNS targeting.",
        "One of the initial clinical applications of exosome therapy involved MSC-derived exosomes for IS. Among the notable studies, the NCT03384433 trial stands out. This randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of exosomes derived from allogenic MSCs in improving disability outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Conducted by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, it is currently recruiting participants [193]. Similarly, the NCT06138210 trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study. It explores the safety and preliminary efficacy of intravenous exosomes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (GD-iExo-003) for treating acute ischemic stroke patients. This study is also actively recruiting participants [194]. These trials highlight the potential of exosome-based therapies in addressing neurological deficits caused by IS, offering hope for innovative treatments in stroke recovery.",
        "Efforts to treat AD with exosome-based therapies have also reached clinical stages. A notable trial, NCT04388982, investigates the use of MSC-derived exosomes for treating AD. This study evaluates their safety, tolerability, and potential cognitive benefits in patients [195].",
        "Across these trials, exosomes have consistently exhibited excellent safety profiles, with minimal immunogenicity and adverse reactions. This aligns with their endogenous origin, which minimizes the likelihood of triggering robust immune responses. However, challenges remain, particularly regarding the scalability of exosome production to meet clinical-grade standards.",
        "The immune profile of exosomes plays a pivotal role in their therapeutic application, directly influencing their efficacy and safety. Naturally derived exosomes, especially those sourced from autologous cells, exhibit minimal immunogenicity due to their endogenous origin. This characteristic makes them particularly suitable for long-term or repeated administration in chronic neurological conditions, where sustained therapy is critical [196].",
        "However, surface modifications designed to enhance the functionality of exosomes, such as ligand conjugation or the integration of nanoparticles, can influence their immunogenicity. For example, Tian et al. demonstrated that excessive chemical functionalization of exosomes could elicit an immune response, emphasizing the need to preserve the innate biocompatibility of these vesicles [114]. To counteract such risks, immune evasion strategies like PEGylation have been developed. These strategies not only improve circulation time by reducing immune recognition but also enhance the therapeutic viability of engineered exosomes [106].",
        "Beyond mitigating immune responses, exosomes have also been utilized to actively modulate immune function. For instance, MSC-derived exosomes loaded with anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, have shown promising results in reducing neuroinflammation in preclinical models of multiple sclerosis and depression. By suppressing inflammatory pathways, these exosomes contribute to restoring neural homeostasis and improving behavioral outcomes [197].",
        "The journey from laboratory research to clinical implementation of exosome-based therapies is fraught with challenges, particularly in the areas of manufacturing, regulation, and scalability. These obstacles present significant barriers to translating promising preclinical findings into viable therapeutic options.",
        "One of the primary challenges lies in the methods used for exosome isolation. Techniques such as ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography are labor-intensive and often yield heterogeneous populations of exosomes. These heterogeneities can impact the consistency and efficacy of the final product. Advances in microfluidics-based isolation methods are emerging as a scalable and efficient alternative, offering higher purity and reproducibility [198]. Purity is especially critical for clinical-grade exosomes, as the co-isolation of non-vesicular contaminants such as lipoproteins could compromise safety and therapeutic efficacy.",
        "Regulatory hurdles also complicate the clinical translation of exosome therapies. Agencies such as the FDA and EMA require comprehensive characterization of exosome preparations, including parameters like size, zeta potential, and molecular composition. Advanced analytical tools, such as nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and proteomics, are increasingly being integrated into quality control workflows to meet these stringent requirements [199]. Furthermore, the classification of exosome-based treatments—whether as biologics, drugs, or devices—remains ambiguous. This lack of clear guidelines hampers regulatory approval processes and creates uncertainty for researchers and manufacturers alike. Establishing precise and consistent regulatory frameworks will be essential to streamline the approval and commercialization of exosome therapies [196].",
        "Another critical issue is the scalability of exosome production. While bioreactor systems offer a promising solution for large-scale harvesting of exosomes, significant optimization is still required to reduce production costs while maintaining product quality. Without these advancements, scaling exosome-based therapies for widespread clinical use remains a formidable challenge [197].",
        "The field of exosome nanobiotechnology is advancing rapidly, offering transformative possibilities for treating neurological diseases. As researchers continue to uncover their potential, attention is shifting toward addressing existing limitations, refining exosome designs, and exploring cutting-edge applications.",
        "Exosome research is transitioning from basic discoveries to translational and clinical applications. Several emerging trends are shaping the future of this field: First, advancements in exosome isolation techniques are enhancing efficiency and scalability. Traditional methods, such as ultracentrifugation, are being replaced by microfluidics and nanotechnology-based platforms. For example, Ortega-Sanchez et al. developed microfluidic systems capable of single-vesicle analysis, enabling unparalleled resolution in exosome characterization [42].",
        "Second, innovative surface modifications are expanding the specificity and functionality of exosomes. Exosomes functionalized with peptide ligands targeting the transferrin receptor, for instance, have shown enhanced BBB penetration and improved targeting of neurological tissues [42].",
        "Lastly, hybrid exosome-nanoparticle systems are emerging as next-generation platforms. These hybrids combine the biocompatibility of exosomes with the functional versatility of synthetic nanoparticles, enabling multi-modal therapies. Fatima et al. explored the use of exosomal shuttles for precision therapeutics, highlighting the role of hybrid exosome-nanoparticle formulations in enhancing targeted drug delivery to brain tumors. Their study discusses how engineered exosomes, functionalized with surface ligands, can improve nanoparticle uptake and drug bioavailability, thereby optimizing therapeutic outcomes [200].",
        "Multi-modal strategies, which integrate therapeutic and diagnostic functions, are increasingly being developed to tackle the complexity of neurological diseases. Theranostic exosomes represent a significant breakthrough in this area. These exosomes are engineered to deliver therapeutic agents while simultaneously enabling real-time imaging to monitor disease progression. In AD research, theranostic exosomes incorporating imaging agents and anti-inflammatory molecules have demonstrated the ability to track disease progression and evaluate treatment efficacy [201].",
        "Combination therapies are another key focus of multi-modal approaches. Exosomes are being engineered to deliver multiple agents targeting different pathways in neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, Yadav et al. investigated macromolecular neurotherapeutic approaches using exosome-based drug delivery systems. Their research focused on exosome-engineered therapies targeting neurodegenerative conditions such as AD and PD, where combination therapies involving siRNA and neurotrophic peptides showed promising results in reducing pathological hallmarks [202]. Similarly, Zhao et al. highlighted the use of extracellular vesicle-based theranostic platforms, where exosomes were engineered to not only deliver therapeutic agents but also serve as biomarkers for early disease detection. This dual function allows for real-time monitoring of treatment response, further optimizing combination therapy approaches [203].",
        "AI is revolutionizing exosome research, providing powerful tools for optimizing their design and application. AI is being employed to identify optimal surface modifications for exosome targeting. Machine learning algorithms analyze molecular databases to predict the most effective ligands for crossing the BBB and engaging specific neuronal receptors. In addition, AI plays a crucial role in overcoming exosome heterogeneity by constructing novel targeting ligands through generative AI approaches. AI-driven techniques, such as Bayesian active learning and deep learning-based classifiers, enable the prediction of exosome uptake and tissue specificity. By leveraging support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), AI enhances the characterization of exosome surface markers and their pharmacokinetic properties. Moreover, AI aids in exosome engineering by optimizing their cargo-loading efficiency, ensuring that therapeutic payloads such as proteins, RNA, or small molecules reach their intended targets with high precision. Recent developments include AI-designed tissue-targeting peptides that enhance exosome-based drug delivery for precision medicine. These AI-driven approaches, combined with multiplexed molecular profiling and high-throughput screening, have the potential to transform exosome therapeutics into hyper-personalized drug delivery systems [204]. This synergy between AI and exosome technology opens the door to more effective treatments for neurological disorders, cancer, and regenerative medicine applications.",
        "Exosome-based drug delivery systems herald a paradigm shift in the treatment of neurological disorders, offering unparalleled precision, efficacy, and biocompatibility. As naturally derived nanocarriers capable of crossing the BBB, exosomes have become a cornerstone of nanobiotechnology, redefining therapeutic strategies for some of the most challenging and debilitating conditions. This concluding synthesis highlights the transformative potential of exosome nanotechnology and its profound implications for the future of neurological health.",
        "Neurological disorders such as AD, PD, glioblastoma, and major depressive disorder present formidable therapeutic challenges due to the highly selective and restrictive nature of the BBB. Traditional drug delivery systems have struggled to achieve adequate CNS bioavailability while minimizing systemic side effects. Exosome-mediated delivery offers a novel and effective solution by leveraging the natural ability of these vesicles to cross the BBB and deliver diverse therapeutic payloads, including small molecules, RNA, proteins, and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. By integrating endogenous compatibility with advanced engineering techniques, exosomes have elevated the concept of targeted therapy to unprecedented levels of sophistication. Surface modifications, such as the incorporation of transferrin ligands or neuropilin-1 peptides, have refined their targeting precision. Simultaneously, bioengineered hybrid systems have expanded their functional versatility, making it possible to selectively deliver drugs to specific neuronal populations. These advancements minimize off-target effects, reduce treatment toxicity, and maximize therapeutic efficacy. Exosome-based platforms transcend the limitations of traditional drug delivery systems by seamlessly integrating therapeutic and diagnostic functionalities. This theranostic capability enables real-time monitoring of disease progression, therapeutic efficacy, and patient response. For instance, exosome systems equipped with imaging probes and therapeutic agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in tracking neuroinflammation and tumor regression in both preclinical and clinical settings. Such multi-modal platforms are paving the way for personalized medicine, wherein treatments can be tailored to the molecular profiles of individual patients, revolutionizing the approach to neurological care.",
        "While exosomes hold immense promise, their integration into clinical practice is not without challenges. One of the foremost barriers lies in scaling up production to meet clinical-grade standards while maintaining the purity and functional integrity of exosomes. Current manufacturing protocols, such as ultracentrifugation, are labor-intensive and yield heterogeneous populations, posing bottlenecks for scalability. Advances in microfluidics-based isolation, AI-driven optimization of manufacturing pipelines, and standardized quality control protocols are actively addressing these challenges. Another significant hurdle is regulatory ambiguity regarding the classification of exosome-based therapies. Whether exosomes are categorized as biologics, drugs, or devices remains unresolved, complicating their pathway to regulatory approval. Clear and consistent regulatory frameworks are essential to streamline the clinical translation of exosome-based treatments. Long-term safety evaluations are equally critical to understanding the immunogenicity and biodistribution of engineered exosomes. While early clinical trials have demonstrated promising safety profiles, sustained research is necessary to confirm their viability for chronic and repeat administration in neurological disorders. Addressing these concerns is vital to ensuring the broader acceptance and adoption of exosome-based therapeutics.",
        "The convergence of exosome nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and advanced bioengineering heralds an era of unprecedented innovation in neurological health. By enabling targeted, efficient, and minimally invasive treatments, exosomes are not merely addressing unmet therapeutic needs—they are redefining what is possible in medicine. Looking to the future, the integration of AI-driven predictive models, patient-specific exosome platforms, and multi-modal approaches promises to accelerate the development of precision therapies. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, exosomes have the potential to slow disease progression, enhance quality of life, and extend survival rates. For psychiatric disorders, they offer groundbreaking avenues to address neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction, laying the foundation for transformative treatment paradigms.",
        "The future of exosome-based therapies lies in fostering collaboration among multidisciplinary researchers, clinicians, regulators, and industry stakeholders. Investment in translational research, robust clinical trials, and scalable manufacturing pipelines is essential to unlock the full potential of this technology. Furthermore, the establishment of regulatory clarity and a patient-centric approach will be critical to ensuring the successful clinical implementation of exosome therapies.",
        "In conclusion, exosome nanotechnology represents a transformative force in the battle against neurological disorders. By redefining drug delivery paradigms, uniting therapeutic and diagnostic applications, and overcoming long-standing barriers to CNS treatment, exosomes have positioned themselves at the forefront of modern medicine. Their impact on neurological health is not just promising—it is revolutionary, offering a new era of hope for patients and clinicians alike.",

        "Neurodegenerative disorder constitutes a substantial and growing global healthcare challenge, which entails the deterioration of neurons in a stepwise manner, resulting in dementia, motor, and other functional impairments (Lamptey et al., 2022). Such adverse conditions like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Huntington’s disease (HD), as well as others, are quite detrimental to people and society. However, they have different ways of development and manifestation. Some lead to memory and cognitive impairment whereas others affect movements, speaking, and breathing. Some of these diseases have familial cases linked to causative genes, but many cases are sporadic and etiologically unknown (Pasko et al., 2022). The initial inflammatory response protects and repairs the affected brain tissue in many neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). However, if the insult persists or the inflammation doesn’t subside, it can lead to a chronic inflammatory state, which is a major aspect in the progression of these conditions (Kwon and Koh, 2020).",
        "CNS is a unique system with a regulated immune response compared to the peripheral immune system. Research indicates that a robust inflammatory response in the peripheral system, triggered by factors such as systemic exposure to lipopolysaccharides or viral infections, can result in the infiltration of immune cells from the periphery to the CNS (Sharma et al., 2021). From there, this infiltration prompts neuroinflammation and nerve cell destruction. Initially, the immune response starts with microglia activation, whereby pro-inflammatory messengers are released by microglia into the Blood-brain barrier (BBB), which weakens. Therefore, T-cells and macrophages from the peripheral immune system migrate into the CNS (Ronaldson and Davis, 2020). Importantly, these peripheral immune cells share functional characteristics with microglia, including the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), which enables their activation by aggregated proteins or pathogen-related molecular patterns. Therefore, the enhanced permeability of the BBB increases the likelihood of peripheral macrophage involvement in CNS inflammation. Acute neuroinflammatory reaction benefits CNS since it triggers an innate immune response that limits damage. Chronic inflammation is evidenced by continuous microglial activation that leads to the production of inflammatory molecules. This increases oxidative and nitrosative stress levels (Sochocka et al., 2017). It sustains the inflammation cycle, thereby extending the duration of inflammation, which is detrimental to NDs. Neuroinflammation and microglia activation are central events leading to neurodegeneration. For example, in AD, the activated microglia are characterized by increased levels of IL-1 and exist near amyloid beta plaque and neurofibrillary tangles (Zhang et al., 2021). On the contrary, in patients with ALS, they are found in the areas of motor neuron degeneration. The abnormal phosphorylation of the microglial activated by IL-1 results in the increase of tau proteins (Li et al., 2003). This review seeks to examine the work of neuroinflammation in NDs. Experimental studies have provided evidence for neuroinflammation as a core pathophysiological process in many CNS diseases over the last few decades. Prevention of neuroinflammation is an important goal in treating these conditions. However, the exact pathways of neuroinflammation have not yet been fully clarified.",
        "Inflammation is a normal part of the body’s defense system against injury or infection. Inflammation within the nervous system or neuroinflammation is a complex phenomenon with both protective and detrimental effects in various neurological diseases. Initially serving as a natural defense mechanism during acute events such as infections, injuries, or trauma, inflammation helps contain the damage, clear debris, and initiate the healing process (Chen et al., 2018). However, in chronic conditions, sustained neuroinflammation can be detrimental, perpetuating a cycle of neuronal damage and degeneration. Chronic neuro-inflammation is characterized by excessive activation of glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes. These cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and ROS, which can worsen neuronal damage and lead to progressive neural deterioration seen in diseases such as AD, PD, HD, and MS (Gąssowska-Dobrowolska et al., 2023).",
        "This disruption allows peripheral immune cells to infiltrate the CNS, thereby perpetuating inflammation and neuronal damage. Moreover, factors such as gut microbiome imbalances and the effects of aging add complexity to the interaction between inflammation and neurodegenerative processes (Jain et al., 2023).",
        "Understanding the intricate balance of neuroinflammation is essential for developing targeted treatments aimed at modulating the immune response to effectively prevent and treat neurological diseases.",
        "Neuroinflammation denotes the innate and adaptive responses to harmful factors such as infections, ischemia, stress, and trauma (Gorji, 2022). Within the context of neuroinflammation, it is hypothesized that four distinct features function as defining hallmarks: elevated cytokine release, microglial cell activation, migration of peripheral immune cells, and localized tissue damage (Konsman, 2022). The response is triggered by microglia, astrocytes, and immune cells (monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes) releasing inflammatory mediators like cytokines, histamines, and ROS (DiSabato et al., 2016). Neuroinflammation initially serves as a defensive reaction, but now studies have proven that prolonged or excessive inflammation is a chief contributor to the development of various neurological disorders, especially degenerative diseases (Kwon and Koh, 2020). Diverse approaches to neuroinflammation triggers are listed below.",
        "Microglia, being a resident immune cell of the CNS, represents up to 20% of the glial population. Microglia are normally activated when the CNS is infected or injured and they move toward the site of infection (Qin et al., 2023). They are also responsible for destroying infected cells and releasing different types of cytotoxins that help in fighting invasive agents. On the other hand, if microglia become hyperactivated, the released substances may prove to be toxic to their neighboring normal tissues (Gao et al., 2023). Microglia can either activate nerve growth or induce neurotoxicity depending on their state of activation. As summarized in Figure 1, in accordance with the classification of macrophages, microglia are commonly grouped into M1 microglia which are classically stimulated and alternatively activated M2 microglia (Guo et al., 2022). TLRs and the gamma interferon signaling pathway induce the production of the inflammatory M1 subtype, characterized by the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and NF-kappaB and chemokines (Chen et al., 2023). Additionally, M1 microglia expresses NADPH oxidases and matrix metalloproteinases-12 (Yang H. et al., 2020). In contrast, the neuroprotective M2 subtype promotes the expression of Arg-1, secretion of growth factors, and the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β (Radandish et al., 2021). This distinction between M1 and M2 microglia underscores the intricate regulatory roles these cells play in neuroinflammation and neuroprotection within the CNS.",
        "It summarizes how neuroinflammation unfolds via the activation of microglia, astrocytes, and peripheral immune cells in neurological disorders. It visualizes the complex interplay between these cells, illustrating their roles in releasing inflammatory signals, causing a cascade of inflammatory responses, and collectively affecting neuronal health. It highlights the intricate network of interactions driving neuroinflammation, offering insight into the mechanisms underlying disease progression and potential targets for therapeutic intervention (Paul et al., 2021).",
        "Glucagon-like peptide 1 Receptor (GLP-1R) is emerging as an anti-inflammatory agent. Activated GLP-1 reduces microglia-induced neuroinflammation by shifting from M1 to M2 subtypes, both in vitro and in vivo, and inhibits the generation of reactive astrocytes (Diz-Chaves et al., 2022). Under physiological conditions, microglia engage in a diverse range of activities that enable them to detect and evaluate inflammatory signals in their environment, promote synaptic plasticity and neuronal function, and remove cellular debris through phagocytosis (Shao et al., 2022). These activities are crucial for maintaining overall brain health and function. Microglia can become hyperactive in pathological states and assume significant roles in neuroinflammation, and the development of CNS disorders including acute injuries such as stroke and head trauma as well as AD, PD, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (Dhaiban et al., 2021). Microglial activation emphasizes the versatile and dynamic nature of this response in the CNS during either a chronic or an acute challenge. To minimize neuroinflammation, it is essential to inhibit this abnormal microglial activation, which could serve as a new treatment approach for various CNS disorders.",
        "Astrocytes are star-like cells, a subtype of glial cells situated in the brain. In the initial stages of research into the heterogeneity of astrocyte responses, two distinct types of reactive astrocytes were identified: inflammatory/neurotoxic astrocytes, referred to as “A1” astrocytes, and neuroprotective astrocytes, referred to as “A2” astrocytes (Reid and Kuipers, 2021). The JAK/STAT3 pathway, NF-κB pathway, MAPK pathway and calcineurin pathway are all involved in initiating and regulating astrocyte activity (Giovannoni and Quintana, 2020). While NF-κB, Calcineurin pathway, and MAPK pathway play a significant role in controlling reactive astrocytes, they appear to modulate rather than initiate this process. They play multifaceted roles in neuroinflammation through numerous processes that affect the pathophysiology of NDs (Ben Haim et al., 2015). Astrocytes are integral to maintaining homeostasis of the CNS and respond dynamically to injury or disease. During neuroinflammation, astrocytes become reactive, a state characterized by morphological changes and upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (Hol and Pekny, 2015). In their reactive state, astrocytes can produce and release a range of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines, that influence the behavior of the surrounding neurons and immune cells. This can be protective, promoting the clearance of pathogens and debris and facilitating repair processes (Ding et al., 2021).",
        "Astrocytes have been found to increase the expression of transmembrane receptors for IL-17 and TrkB in response to neuroinflammation. Upon binding of IL-17 to its receptors, the recruitment of NFκB activator 1 may occur, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Kwon and Koh, 2020). However, persistent, or dysregulated astrocyte activation can also contribute to chronic inflammation. Neurodegenerative processes are often characterized by the ongoing astrocytic release of proinflammatory factors that exacerbate neuronal damage. Moreover, astrocytes regulate the blood-brain barrier, and during neuroinflammation, their processes can alter BBB permeability, potentially permitting unwanted immune cells and neurotoxic substances to enter the brain parenchyma (Zang et al., 2022). Astrocytes are crucial in the process of myelination by releasing substances that encourage the development of oligodendrocytes and the formation of myelin. Moreover, these cells ensure the provision of energy and essential nutrients to the oligodendrocytes by maintaining metabolic regulation. Additionally, astrocytes protect both oligodendrocytes and myelin by maintaining the integrity of the BBB (Hu et al., 2023).",
        "Astrocytes also affect neurodegeneration through their roles in CNS metabolism and neurotransmitter homeostasis. In neurodegenerative conditions, astrocytic dysfunction can disrupt the metabolic support of neurons, aggravate excitotoxicity by limiting glutamate uptake, and alter synaptic function, all of which exacerbate neuronal loss and cognitive decline (Satarker et al., 2022). Additionally, astrocytes interact with other glial cells such as microglia, potentially escalating neuroinflammatory responses and influencing disease progression. Their capability for phagocytosis, which is essential for cleaning up myelin debris and dead cells, can also become maladaptive, leading to sustained inflammation and the inhibition of regenerative processes (Sun et al., 2023).",
        "Peripheral immune cells such as Neutrophils, Monocytes, NK cells, Dendritic cells, T-cells, and even B-cells play crucial roles in the immune response (Kanashiro et al., 2020). In immune response, neutrophils engulf microbes around infected areas via phagocytosis. Neutrophil migration into CNS has been noted under certain pathological conditions, including neurodegeneration (Turner and Sharp, 2016). These studies suggest that these neutrophils facilitate the breakdown of the BBB through the release of free radicals, proteolytic enzymes, and matrix metalloproteinases (Guo et al., 2021). Secondly, post-neutrophil activation and BBB damage lead to the release of neutrophil extracellular traps into the extracellular space, which further impairs the integrity of the BBB (Zang et al., 2022). Such structures are complex webs formed from neutrophil degranulation. Neutrophilic migration to the cortex and hippocampus releases IL-17 that causes cytotoxicity and BBB disruption. This in turn attracts more neutrophils to the site and intensifies the damage (Spiteri et al., 2022). Monocytes are a type of white blood cell found in the CNS and it’s differentiated into monocyte-derived macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Ochocka and Kaminska, 2021). Monocyte-derived macrophages enter the CNS through a compromised or intact BBB. These infiltrating blood-borne monocytes have a crucial role in demyelination processes within the CNS and contribute to the secretion of neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory factors that regulate neuropathic events.",
        "Monocyte-derived macrophages contribute toward reduced acute and chronic microglia-mediated inflammation. In pathological conditions, there is migration of NK cells toward the CNS by chemokines (Rivas-Fuentes et al., 2021). The CX3C chemokine ligand 1 produced by neuroinflammation is an essential factor in guiding the CX3CR1 positive NK cell to the brain (Maghazachi, 2013). In neuroinflammation, NK cells engage with glial cells affecting it and affecting the physiology of CNS by getting rid of glial cells and releasing the IFN-γ (Cabeza-Cabrerizo et al., 2021). Dendritic cells express MHCII and CD11c in CNS and this expression is used to identify the site of dendritic cells in the brain (Kennedy and Silver, 2015). The release of chemokines and adhesion molecules enables peripheral dendritic cells to migrate to the meninges or choroid plexus, where they can recognize antigens and present them to T-cells, leading to T-cell activation. It is important to note that the number of B-cells in the CSF increases substantially in CNS inflammation. In addition, B-cells significantly increase their number in the brain parenchyma and perivascular space (Spiteri et al., 2022). This draws attention to the role played by peripheral immunoglobulin cells such as dendritic cells and B–cells in the sophisticated immune reactions occurring in inflamed CNS.",
        "Cytokines are very important messengers between the immune systems which includes innate and adaptive immunity. Several cells in the CNS can synthesize cytokines such as glial cells, blood components, and peripheral tissues (Seif et al., 2017). The effects of cytokines are mediated through ligands binding to receptors and triggering either JAK-STAT or MAPK signaling pathways. Cytokines can identify such cells and as a result, trigger the migration of further components of immunity and the production of more cytokines (Kempuraj et al., 2017). Cytokine expression is generally low in the peripheral tissue and the CNS. Nevertheless, in response to immunological challenges, peripheral cytokines, and peripheral immune cells, for instance, T cells, cross a protective BBB through various active transport mechanisms. Besides, peripheral cytokines diffuse across the BBB to influence the CNS. In addition, microglia and brain mast cells also secrete cytokines to participate largely in neuroinflammation (Lotfi et al., 2019). Studies have shown that inflammatory cytokines released during neuroinflammation are important in the leukocyte-mediated process. IL-6, IL-23, IL-1β, IFNγ, TNF, and Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) are key cytokines in the neuroinflammation process (Hamilton, 2020). This implies that all cells within the CNS are endogenous IL1β and IL6 producers, contributing toward inflammation. IL-23 is detected through T cells which promotes pathogenic activity. The action of GM-CSF allows inflammatory monocyte-derived cells to cause damage to tissues (Paul et al., 2021).",
        "Neurodegenerative diseases associated with neuroinflammation encompass a category of diseases that affect the spinal cord and the brain resulting in progressive degeneration of neural tissue and mortality (Sobue et al., 2023). In these diseases, there is a release of immune cells into the CNS causing inflammation and resulting in the degeneration of the neural tissues. Each of these diseases has its own unique set of symptoms and progression, but they all share the common thread of neuroinflammation, which plays a key role in their pathophysiology.",
        "Alzheimer’s disease stands as the most prevalent cause of dementia, marked by progressive neurodegeneration. The estimated global count of dementia patients is projected to reach 139 million by 2050 (Mohandas et al., 2009). AD is marked by a continuous degenerative process, initially presenting with memory impairment, and subsequently leading to cognitive decline that can affect behavior, language, visuospatial orientation, and ultimately the motor system. As shown in Figure 2, the neuropathological characteristics of AD include extracellular Aβ(amyloid beta) plaques and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau (p-τ) forming neurofibrillary tangles, accompanied by synaptic and neuronal loss (Sobue et al., 2023). Neuroinflammation in AD occurs when glial cells, mainly microglia and astrocytes, get activated. Such an activation prompts the release of inflammatory factors which are mainly cytokines and chemokines which in turn surround the senile plaques and damaged neurons in the brain (Clayton et al., 2017).",
        "The inflammatory signaling pathway involved in AD is depicted in the figure. It involves the activation of microglia and astrocytes, leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines. This activation also triggers the release of amyloid beta, a protein that is crucial for the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles and proinflammatory cytokines contribute to neuronal dysfunction, a key characteristic of AD (Gómez-Benito et al., 2020; Pajares et al., 2020).",
        "Investigations show clear evidence of microglial inflammation at the brain level among humans with AD, which is been visualized in vivo via PET imaging. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are detected at higher levels of the blood serum and postmortem brain tissues among the AD patient and specifically, Aβ can be used to activate the brain’s immune cells. Microglia under activation produce certain products that promote neuronal survival and assist in the removal of waste products by stimulating receptors found on triggering receptors expressed in myeloid cells 2, thereby facilitating the degradation of Aβ oligomers (McQuade and Blurton-Jones, 2019). Beta-amyloid oligomers possess a tendency to agglomerate into plaques, which triggers the activation of microglia. However, if these immune cells fail to effectively remove Aβ, they become chronically activated and intensify the aggregation process. This persistent activation results in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic substances, which collectively contribute to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity (McQuade and Blurton-Jones, 2019). Mutations in TREM2 and CD33 genes have been discovered to cause a high risk of AD (Griciuc et al., 2019). AD brains experience chronic inflammation due to neuronal loss and involve multiple cell types and molecules (Onyango et al., 2021). These factors combine to make a crucial contribution to the commencement and course of this disease.",
        "Parkinson’s disease follows AD as the most known neurodegenerative condition. It is suffered by more than one in a hundred people who are 65 years old or more. By 2030, the incidence is estimated to double (Gómez-Benito et al., 2020). It is a complex, progressive neurodegenerative disease whereby the number of dopamine-producing cells within the substantia nigra (SN) are irreversibly lost. The deposition of the α – synuclein, a synaptic protein plays an important role in PD, forming aggregates in the form of oligomers or fibrils (Pajares et al., 2020). Aggregates α – synuclein forms clusters and interacts with TLRs, stimulating the activation of microglial cells. Such activation sets off a series of actions, for instance, the synthesis and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These pro-inflammatory cytokines are overexpressed resulting in the cells’ apoptosis causing the progression of PD (Lull and Block, 2010). However, excessive stimulation of microglia can cause serious, deleterious neurotoxic effects as a result of excessive synthesis of toxic compounds such as superoxide, nitric oxide, and TNF-α (Stefanis, 2012). The overexpression of α-syn or duplication in the SNCA gene leads to the buildup of α-synuclein fibrils, major components of Lewy bodies and neurites (Marogianni et al., 2020). In PD, Lewy bodies & α-synuclein-containing neurites cause dopaminergic neuron death, while α-synuclein pathology activates microglia via TLR interaction. This triggers inflammatory responses, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and NF-κB pathway activation (Figure 3).",
        "The intricate relationship between the gut and brain axes in PD is delineated by the schematic signaling pathway, with a focus on the inflammatory cascade triggered by dysbiosis at the gut lumen and BBB. Dysbiosis leads to an imbalance in gut microbiota composition, which in turn fosters the release of inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines breach the BBB and infiltrate the brain, where they exert their detrimental effects on dopaminergic neurons. The figure highlights the crucial role of dysbiosis-induced inflammation in contributing to the neurodegenerative characteristic of PD, emphasizing the potential therapeutic targets within the gut-brain axis for mitigating disease progression (Stefanis, 2012; Mey et al., 2023).",
        "Adaptive immunity is also associated with neuroinflammation in PD. The SN of individuals with PD is invaded by both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells with CD 8 + T cells being significantly elevated. Cd8 + T-cells may hold the key in early-stage PD and may perhaps come before any detectable pathological α -synuclein in the SN (Ghasemi et al., 2017). In the initial stages of PD, infiltration is observed in the SN, which tends to slow down the progression of the disease. While there have been attempts to measure the number of CD4 + T cells in the blood of PD patients, the results remain controversial. Several studies have found a substantial decrease in CD4 + T cells in PD patients. However, the counting of Treg cells in the blood of PD patients yields inconsistent results, with studies using a non-specific marker of CD4 + CD25 + to identify Treg cells (Ghasemi et al., 2017). Studies have linked gut microbiota imbalance to the development of PD, where dysbiosis increases gut permeability, enabling harmful substances to trigger inflammation. Activation of immune cells by microbial products releases inflammatory molecules that damage dopaminergic neurons through neuroinflammation, facilitated by the vagus nerve (Zhang X. et al., 2023).",
        "Multiple sclerosis is a chronic immune-mediated disease characterized by demyelination of the CNS (Ghasemi et al., 2017). It affects approximately 2.8 million people worldwide, with a higher incidence in females (Walton et al., 2020). Neuroinflammation in MS is caused by oxidative stress, energy deficits, ion imbalance, mitochondrial damage, and inadequate regeneration processes (Papiri et al., 2023). The disease process includes neuroinflammation, where immune cells infiltrate the CNS, attack myelin sheath, and create demyelinating lesions, which are key in MS pathology and linked to initial neurological symptoms. Axonal transection and chronic demyelination cause permanent damage, ultimately leading to neuron loss and brain atrophy, which signify neurodegeneration (Mey et al., 2023). The disease can manifest in several forms, with relapsing remission being the most common. Although immunomodulatory therapies can temper inflammatory attacks, treatment options for the progressive neurodegenerative phase remain limited, underlining the urgent need for neuroprotective strategies and early interventions to prevent irreversible neurological decline.",
        "HD is a genetic disorder that leads to the progressive degeneration of neurons. It is caused by a repeat mutation in the huntingtin gene (Kim et al., 2021). HD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective loss of neurons in the striatum, which results in motor and cognitive impairments and often culminates in death 10–15 years after the onset of symptoms (Jia et al., 2022) (Figure 4). The huntingtin protein in the N-terminal region contains an expansion of glutamine repeats (>36 glutamines), which is believed to be the cause of HD. However, the exact mechanism of neuronal death in HD remains unclear. Several mechanisms, including inflammation, may work together to contribute to the development of HD. Inflammation response alterations are observable even before the appearance of classical HD symptoms. Gaining insight into the impact of inflammation on HD would aid in the development of new treatment strategies for the disease (Jia et al., 2022). Neuroinflammation in HD is stimulated by glial cell activation, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory molecules. Post-mortem investigations have shown increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in various brain regions in individuals with HD (Jia et al., 2022). In HD, neuroinflammation is an early event, evident even before classical symptoms arise, and is a crucial aspect of disease pathogenesis. This inflammatory response includes the activation of microglia and astrocytes, which, under healthy conditions, act in support of neurons (Palpagama et al., 2019). However, in HD, these glial cells, when expressing the mutant huntingtin protein, not only lose their protective abilities but also contribute to neurodegeneration through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that damage neurons (Wilton and Stevens, 2020). Although neuroinflammation often has detrimental effects, including exacerbating neuronal death, it can sometimes be beneficial by aiding in the clearance of cell debris (Harry and Kraft, 2008). Comprehending neuroinflammation’s dual function in HD is vital for devising therapies that specifically regulate immune reactions, to alleviate or treat the disease.",
        "An illustrated summary of the brain regions impacted by major neurodegenerative disorders (Zahid et al., 2019).",
        "ALS is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons. It affects approximately 1.75–3 out of every 100,000 individuals annually (Masrori and Van Damme, 2020). This leads to muscle wasting, weakness, and eventually, paralysis. In the neurodegenerative process of ALS, certain proteins, such as TDP-43, mislocalize and aggregate in cells, contributing to neuronal cell death. ALS is a disease characterized by upper and lower motor neuron loss with a signature feature of cytoplasmic aggregates containing TDP-43, which are detected in nearly all patients (Mejzini et al., 2019). The disease can manifest due to both genetic and sporadic factors, with genetic forms being linked to mutations in specific genes, such as TARDBP, FUS, SOD1 and C9orf72 (Mejzini et al., 2019). Inflammation in ALS involves both reactive microglia and astrocytes. Mutant superoxide dismutase 1 released from motor neurons triggers microglial and astrocytic activation, contributing to the inflammatory process (You et al., 2023). Dendritic cells, T cells, microglia, and macrophages produce cytokines and chemokines that promote inflammation. The extent of microglial activation correlates with clinical deficits in ALS (Zhang and An, 2007). Furthermore, neuroinflammation plays a critical role in ALS progression, with activated microglia and astrocytes releasing inflammatory cytokines that can exacerbate motor neuron damage (Mortada et al., 2021). These inflammatory processes not only contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in ALS but may also drive further neurotoxicity. The interaction between neurodegenerative processes and neuroinflammation creates a complex cycle that accelerates ALS progression (Mortada et al., 2021). Despite the growing understanding of these mechanisms, translating this knowledge into effective therapies remains a significant challenge in the battle against this devastating disease.",
        "Therapeutic approaches for NDs associated with neuroinflammation are diverse and continually evolving. The primary goals of these therapies are to control symptoms, slow disease progression, and promote quality of life for patients. Some common therapeutic approaches include:",
        "Currently, there are no cures for neurodegenerative disorders, and treatments only offer minimal relief for symptoms. However, significant progress has been made in studying the role of neuroinflammation in these conditions, leading to the development of new therapies targeting this critical pathway (Mortada et al., 2021). In other words, a phase II, double-blind, randomized study showed that weekly subcutaneous injections of TNFα(Etanercept) in a tiny number of mild to moderate AD dementia patients had no significant results as compared with placebo (Holbrook et al., 2021).",
        "NLRP3 inflammasome is an important protein complex that activates in response to certain signals such as those involving disturbance of homeostasis-altering molecule patterns, pathogen-related molecular patterns, and danger-associated molecular patterns. Numerous proteins linked to diseases can trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome, including Fibrillar β-amyloid. This protein’s phagocytosis leads to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through the damage of lysosomes and the release of cathepsin B in AD (Holbrook et al., 2021). Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by tau monomers and oligomers has been noted to impact tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in AD. Additionally, aggregated α-synuclein has been shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in PD. In contrast, mutant SOD1 functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in ALS (Zhang W. et al., 2023). Suppressing the activation of IL-1β which is controlled by NLRP3 inflammasome, protects transgenic models of AD by effectively stopping the subsequent production of IL-1β, which plays a pivotal role in triggering inflammatory reactions in the brain (Zahid et al., 2019). Inzomelid compounds have been specifically developed to inhibit NLRP3 and have progressed to Phase I clinical trials, showcasing the potential of directly targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in a clinical setting (Han and Le, 2023). The use of MCC950 (NLRP3 inflammasome Inhibitor) was effective during preclinical conditions where it was tested in the various MS mice models (Sharma et al., 2023). Finally, several animal models of AD, ALS, and HD demonstrate inhibition of pathology and disease progression through the use of C5a inhibitors (Chang et al., 2017). Currently, researchers are investigating the possible anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating functions of such molecules as GM-CSF. The regulatory microglial proliferation is promoted by the GM-CSF-driven effects on dendritic cells. A group of patients treated with 127 amino acids synthetic GM-CSF leukine(Sargramostim) compared to control groups showed an improvement in cognitive function and memory (Chang et al., 2017). Sargramostim has also proven to be safe and tolerable in phase 2 trials for all AD patients. In addition, investigations into the immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects of Sargramostim are going on. Preclinical and phase I trials revealed a significant improvement in motor disability in PD as well as protection of dopaminergic neurons through Treg induction (Saleh et al., 2022). However, GM-CSF has been controversial in treating ALS with mixed clinical findings showing that GM-CSF might not be important to ALS patients or at least not slow down the disease process (Mortada et al., 2021). Other drugs targeting PPAR-γ and GLP-1 have also been described for their neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory actions besides GM-CSF (Zhang Z. et al., 2023). Modern research suggests that molecules might relieve AD and PD symptoms, by restoring Akt-1 and mTOR, and insulin Pathways in the brain. The use of GLP-1 agonist drugs in a preliminary clinical trial has revealed some improvement in pathophysiology but not sufficient for conclusive evidence (Tong et al., 2016). The ability of PPAR-γ agonists to reduce neuroinflammation, Aβ-42, phosphorylated tau, and synaptophysin, with resulting improvement in spatial memory, as well as motor function, has been demonstrated in AD mouse models (Chang et al., 2017). Two PPAR-γ agonist compounds, T3D-959 and Pioglitazone, have been tested to be safe and tolerable in phase II clinical trials involving patients. Cognition and insulin metabolism have remarkably been improved in AD patients through T3D-959 (Machado et al., 2019). In preclinical studies, it has been shown that pioglitazone effectively reduces neuroinflammation and microglial proliferation in multiple PD models. However, these findings need to be confirmed in clinical trials (Machado et al., 2019).",
        "Anti-inflammatory therapy is a critical aspect of managing NDs, including AD, PD, and ALS. In these diseases, inflammation plays a central and multifaceted role in disease progression (Jung et al., 2019). Consequently, therapeutic efforts have focused on developing drugs that can suppress this inflammatory response. Several approaches have been explored, such as kinase inhibitors, immunotherapy, and repurposing existing medications. Kinase inhibitors target signaling pathways involved in inflammation, while non-kinase anti-inflammatory drugs comprise conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and more targeted therapies that aim to intercept specific aspects of the inflammatory cascade (Zarrin et al., 2021). Therapeutic strategies for these diseases may involve the use of drugs that inhibit the activity of proinflammatory cytokines or the cellular responses they provoke. For instance, NSAIDs can inhibit COX-1 and COX-2, which are involved in the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (Ahmadi et al., 2022). Other targeted therapies may include antibodies or receptor antagonists that specifically neutralize or inhibit cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6. These therapies aim to reduce neuroinflammation, which accelerates neurodegenerative pathology (Turner et al., 2014).",
        "However, the development of anti-inflammatory therapies for NDs is complex due to several factors, including the need to cross the BBB, potential side effects, and the precise timing required to intervene without disrupting the natural beneficial roles of inflammation, such as tissue repair and pathogen defense. Therefore, extensive research is needed to optimize these treatments and identify appropriate targets and treatment windows to provide therapeutic benefits.",
        "Toll-like receptors are vital receptors in innate immunity, detecting pathogens or damage-related patterns, and triggering immune responses. Their presence spans between immune and non-immune cells, recognizing specific ligands and activating signaling pathways leading to inflammatory responses (Duan et al., 2022). Their evolutionary conservation underscores their importance in immunity. Dysregulation of TLRs has been implicated in various diseases. TLR2 plays a significant role in NDs by contributing to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In the context of PD, TLR2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of the condition. An increase in neuronal TLR2 expression correlates with the disease stage, and studies have shown that TLR2 may contribute to the pathology by inhibiting autophagy and promoting the accumulation of α-syn, a protein involved in the formation of Lewy bodies characteristic of PD (Gorecki et al., 2021). Furthermore, in models of PD, TLR2 deficient mice showed reduced accumulation of α-syn and ameliorated motor deficits. Neuronal TLR2 has also been shown to mediate neuron-to-neuron transmission of α-syn, implicating it in the propagation of synucleinopathies (Mazzotta et al., 2023). In ALS, increased levels of TLR2 and TLR4 have been found in the spinal cord of the patient’s postmortem. Its expression, mostly by microglia/macrophages, suggests its role in glia-mediated neuroinflammation and possibly neurodegeneration (Zhang W. et al., 2023). Overall, TLR2 is a key player in the neuroinflammatory response across various NDs, and targeting TLR2 could potentially have therapeutic benefits in these conditions.",
        "TLR4 is a critical component of the immune system and is recognized for its role in mediating the response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns; however, it also has a notable impact on the pathophysiology of NDs (Aboudounya and Heads, 2021). TLR4 is expressed in microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, and other cell types within the CNS. In neurodegenerative disorders, aberrant activation of TLR4 can contribute to chronic neuroinflammation, a common underlying feature of such diseases. TLR4 has been implicated in the response of amyloid-beta plaques to AD. The binding of Aβ to TLR4 can activate microglia, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to neuronal damage and AD progression (Wu et al., 2022). Similarly, in ALS, the upregulation of TLR4, particularly in glial cells, is associated with enhanced inflammation and neurodegeneration (Fiebich et al., 2018). Experimental models have revealed that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 can ameliorate some disease characteristics and extend survival. Although in PD the involvement of TLR4 is less well compared to in AD and ALS, TLR4-mediated neuroinflammation can exacerbate the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that modulation of TLR4 activity might offer therapeutic potential (Conte et al., 2023). Furthermore, in HD, TLR4 activation contributes to an inflammatory environment that facilitates neuronal dysfunction and death.",
        "Overall, TLR4 participates in the cascade of immune responses that result in the production of neurotoxic substances, perpetuating neuronal loss and CNS damage, which are characteristic of NDs (Griffioen et al., 2018). Thus, modulation of TLR4 activity represents a potential therapeutic approach to mitigate neuroinflammation and modify the course of these disorders. However, the precise mechanisms by which TLR4 contributes to the pathogenesis of different NDs and the successful translation of TLR4-targeting strategies into effective treatments require further investigation (Zhou et al., 2020).",
        "The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the development and progression of NDs through the gut-brain axis, which is a communication system between the gut and the brain (Jain et al., 2023). The gut microbiota is comprised of an extensive array of microorganisms that possess the ability to influence cognitive functioning by transmitting microbial metabolites to the brain via the gut-brain axis or the nervous system. An imbalance in gut microbiota, particularly a surge in detrimental bacteria and a decline in helpful bacteria has been connected to NDs like AD, PD, and HD (Kandpal et al., 2022). It is essential to understand the role of gut microbiota in these diseases to develop novel treatments, including antibiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, aimed at maintaining healthy gut microbiota and potentially improving outcomes for NDs (Khatoon et al., 2023). Research indicates that changes in the gut microbial composition can result in changes in gut permeability, chronic systemic inflammation, and increased production of amyloid and tau proteins, which are hallmark features of AD, leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Kowalski and Mulak, 2019). For example, a decrease in beneficial bacterial populations like Bifidobacteria, known for their anti-inflammatory properties, has been observed in AD patients, alongside an increase in pro-inflammatory bacterial species (Abdelhamid et al., 2022). Several studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of modulating the gut microbiota in AD. Strategies such as the administration of probiotics and prebiotics have been explored to restore a balanced gut microbiota, alleviate inflammation, and potentially enhance cognitive function in AD patients (Ansari et al., 2023).",
        "The increasing interest in the role of gut microbiota in PD is underpinned by mounting evidence suggesting its involvement in the condition’s pathophysiology through the gut-brain axis. Studies have revealed that gut microbiota can impact motor deficits and neuroinflammation, both characteristic symptoms of PD. Specific changes in the gut microbiota’s composition have been linked to the disease and its clinical manifestations (Shen et al., 2021). One hypothesis proposes that misfolded α-synuclein, a protein central to PD pathology, may originate in the gut and migrate to the brain via the vagus nerve. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms preceding motor symptoms in many PD patients (Klann et al., 2021). Microbial metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids produced by gut bacteria, exhibit neuroprotective effects and impact the immune system, potentially relevant in PD. Animal studies have demonstrated that microbiota transplantation can transfer behavioral phenotypes associated with PD, suggesting a potential role of gut bacteria in modulating neurodegenerative processes (Cenit et al., 2017). Dysbiosis, or imbalance, of the gut microbiota, has been strongly associated with oxidative stress-mediated NDs. Certain strains of probiotics, including Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, which are derived from the gut microbiota, possess the capability to produce antioxidants, vitamins, and bioactive molecules. This ability aids in the maintenance of redox homeostasis and helps prevent diseases that are associated with oxidative stress (Wang et al., 2022). Recognizing the role of gut microbiota in these illnesses is important for devising new therapies, including antibiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation to preserve a balanced gut microbiota and potentially enhance outcomes for NDs.",
        "Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are fundamental functional abnormalities that are closely linked to the pathophysiology of ADs. Recent, placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted within the past few years have explored the potential benefits of antioxidant-based interventions in patients with ADs. Resveratrol, carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and melatonin supplements are examples of substances that have been administered and investigated in these trials (Salehi et al., 2018). There are so many studies that indicate that resveratrol one of the powerful non-flavonoid polyphenols that has been known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties has managed to lower Aβ peptides toxicity and aggregation in the hippocampus, a part of the brain that is involved in AD patients (Li et al., 2020). Resveratrol also increases neurogenesis, protects the BBB, and stops hippocampal destruction by blocking the accumulation of Aβ1–42 in the hippocampus.",
        "Some studies have indicated that supplementation with carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin E might improve working memory in old age (Salehi et al., 2018). Melatonin and its effects on sleep have also been explored in clinical trials for AD, with notable findings related to changes in sleep patterns, although direct cognitive or clinical improvements have yet to be firmly established, likely due to the short-term treatment periods (Meng and Wu, 2023).",
        "Moving beyond AD, antioxidants in PD patients, especially omega 3/6, fatty acids, and vitamin supplements have been examined. These nutritional strategies comprise omega-3, omega-6, and traditional antioxidant vitamin formulations. Furthermore, new antioxidants like BN-82451 have been shown to enhance motility function and hinder neurodegeneration in mice models of HD (Salehi et al., 2018). In studies involving rodents, vitamin C and alpha-lipoic acid have displayed beneficial effects on locomotor symptoms and survival rates. Coenzyme Q10, which functions as a component of the mitochondrial membrane and a free radical scavenger, has demonstrated therapeutic potential in HD models. (Blyufer et al., 2021).",
        "Riluzole is the only FDA-approved drug for treating ALS. Riluzole mitigates the generation of ROS by enhancing glutathione production, a pathway closely associated with mitochondria-driven apoptosis (Cho and Shukla, 2020). Recent placebo-randomized clinical trials have explored the use of Edaravone in ALS patients. Edaravone, recognized as the first free radical scavenger, offers potential benefits in modulating oxidative damage across various diseases, particularly neurodegenerative conditions (Sever et al., 2022).",
        "In the context of ALS, novel compounds such as WN1316, an acylaminoimidazole derivative, have exhibited the ability to slow disease progression in advanced ALS mouse models. In HD, dietary flavonoid rutin was evaluated in a rat model, demonstrating potential therapeutic effects in this context (Khan et al., 2020).",
        "Nanomedicine is a branch of medicine based on integrating nanotechnology which shows a huge potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. Nanomedicine offers a unique opportunity to administer drugs with selective targets in the brain via drug-loaded Nanoparticles(NPs) (Yusuf et al., 2023). The NPs can wrap around hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs to increase their solubility and stability. More so, some of the inorganic or polymeric NPs developed can scavenge ROS and sequester iron thus offering a potential approach for mitigating iron overload-induced injuries and oxidative stress (Xu et al., 2022). Furthermore, nanomedicine has shown promise in modulating apoptotic pathways, both intrinsic and extrinsic and reducing the burden of Aβ-peptides, a critical initiator of AD. Exosomes, a type of NP, have been investigated as a reliable nanomedicine strategy because of their capability to traverse biological barriers and move to organs without blood supply (Chen et al., 2021). In a previous study, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes effectively restored the activity of genes linked to the adaptability of synapses and decreased the expression of Aβ in individuals with AD. Furthermore, the results indicated that mice subjected to this treatment demonstrated marked enhancements in cognitive abilities, alleviation of neuron and astrocyte damage, and improved brain glucose metabolism. Current treatments for AD involve using nanostructure-based delivery systems, which fall into four main categories: metallic/non-metallic NPs, organic NPs, lipid vesicles, and emulsion-based systems (Mir Najib Ullah et al., 2023). Gold NPs are optimal for crossing the BBB and have neuroprotective properties, making them effective in treating AD by inhibiting Aβ aggregation when combined with glutathione. Cerium-NPs also have neuroprotective potential and antioxidant effects, and when combined with triphenylphosphonium, they can prevent neuronal death and have an anti-Alzheimer effect (Mir Najib Ullah et al., 2023). Nanostructured lipid carriers are a promising delivery method for targeting drugs to the brain, with a disorganized inner lipid matrix of solid and liquid lipids. However, their physical instability and safety profile limit their use, which can be addressed by optimizing temperature, storage conditions, and pH levels (Mir Najib Ullah et al., 2023). Curcumin-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers are effective in treating oxidative stress conditions in AD by increasing curcumin bioavailability in the brain and reducing Aβ hallmarks (Ege, 2021). The use of indomethacin-containing lipid-core nanocapsules has been shown to reduce the harmful consequences caused by Aβ1-42 in patients with AD (Bernardi et al., 2012).",
        "Nanophytomedicines for PD is a type of therapeutic agent that utilizes nanoparticles to deliver phytochemicals, such as those found in Mucuna pruriens, Ginkgo biloba, Turmeric, Green tea, and Ginseng, to the brain (Burns et al., 2023). These treatments aim to improve the efficacy and penetration of phytochemicals across the BBB, which is a major challenge in treating neurological diseases. In vitro studies often involve cell models to test the effectiveness of nanoplatforms and phytomedicines against PD on various molecular pathways implicated in the disease. For example, in one study, turmeric-initiated biocompatible gold nanoparticles increased cell viability in MPP + -treated PC-12 cells, a model for dopaminergic neurons (Burns et al., 2023). These nanoparticles exhibited antioxidative properties by scavenging free radicals and increasing antioxidant defense enzymes, thereby helping to balance or inhibit ROS generation at oxidative stress.",
        "Vitro research has delved into the encapsulation of phytochemicals with nanoparticles to maximize their neuroprotective potential. A variety of NPs, such as gold, chitosan, and graphene oxide, have been utilized for this goal. Therapeutic agents, including curcumin, puerarin, ginkgolide B, and resveratrol, have exhibited the capacity to mitigate toxic effects on neuronal cells. Among these, curcumin is particularly effective in reducing α-synuclein aggregates, restoring cellular morphology, decreasing levels of ROS, and minimizing apoptosis (Burns et al., 2023).",
        "Phytochemical encapsulation has been shown to enhance their bioavailability and neuroprotective effects, as compared to unencapsulated phytochemicals. Research indicates that encapsulation improves the blood-brain barrier permeability of phytomedicines, which is crucial for delivering therapeutic agents to the brain (Yang B. et al., 2020).",
        "Although nanomedicine has shown promising results in enhancing the efficacy of medicines, reducing dosage requirements, and minimizing side effects in treating NDs, it has also been found to trigger inflammation, apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, and oxidative stress, which may pose acute or long-term health risks (Fakhri et al., 2022). Therefore, it is essential to increase our understanding of the mechanism of toxicity and conduct further studies on NP-induced toxicity to ensure the safe use of nanomedicine in humans.",
        "Genetic therapy for NDs employs various techniques to modify or replace genes associated with these conditions, to address the underlying genetic causes of diseases such as AD, PD, and HD. This approach encompasses gene editing, replacement, or silencing strategies designed to either slow or potentially reverse disease progression. Recent works show the enrichment of rare variants in genes typically linked to early-onset, family degenerative diseases in populations affected by non-familial cases of the disease, which probably would imply a moderate effect on the risk of the disease (Dilliott et al., 2021). For instance, some rare variants associated with late-onset sporadic AD have been associated in patients with APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2; SNCA, PARK2, LRRK2, and VPS35 have been associated with both early and late-onset sporadic PD; SOD1, FUS and DNASC7 patients having both familial and sporadic ALS (Boros et al., 2022). One promising therapeutic avenue encompasses antisense oligonucleotides, the short nucleotide sequences, which can modulate gene expression, as well as splicing. Indeed, studies targeting SOD1 and C9orf72 mutations have demonstrated efficacy against preclinical models of ALS, and clinical studies using intrathecal administration of antisense oligonucleotides for these genes are ongoing (Sharma et al., 2017). Viral vectors are commonly utilized in gene therapy to facilitate the delivery of genetic material into cells, particularly in the treatment of NDs. These vectors have been engineered from viruses that possess the natural capability to infect and transfer their genomes into host cells (Rittiner et al., 2020). For instance, studies have shown that intracerebral administration of AAV2-NGF is well-tolerated and provides evidence of its therapeutic impact on cognitive decline in patients with AD-related dementia (Chen et al., 2020). In addition, a clinical trial has demonstrated the effectiveness of a lentiviral vector in delivering larger DNA payloads for PD. The study demonstrated that ProSavin, a gene therapy using lentiviral vectors to restore dopamine production, led to improvements in motor behavior and displayed safety in all patients with advanced PD (Chen et al., 2020). Non-viral vectors, despite their safety limitations, offer potential solutions. Exploring innovative vectors, such as nanoparticles and liposomes, is essential. Non-viral delivery vectors are categorized into lipid-based and polymeric vectors (Kanvinde et al., 2022). Another potential approach for transgene delivery involves gene silencing. RNA interference is a biological mechanism that involves the utilization of small interfering RNAs to decrease the synthesis of proteins by degrading their corresponding messenger RNAs. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that synthetic siRNAs can be administered to humans to specifically downregulate targeted genes or proteins, and are generally well-tolerated, as evidenced by studies such as NCT01559077 and NCT01437059 (Chen et al., 2020). While research on this field is ongoing and seems promising it remains mostly experimental for many neurodegenerative conditions.",
        "Stem cells are unique cell types with the ability to multiply extensively, regenerate, differentiate into various specialized cell types, and contribute to the regeneration of body tissues. It has a self-renewal capability and has also shown an ability to differentiate into diverse specialized cells (Biehl and Russell, 2009). These include embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and neural stem cells. Stem cell therapy has emerged to be a potential area of research and treatment for NDs (Sivandzade and Cucullo, 2021). For a thorough grasp of how stem cell technology can be used to tackle NDs, we must know how different stem cell characteristics can interplay with the disease mechanisms (Figure 5). Currently, concerning AD and other similar neurodegenerative disorders, the main treatment strategies are based on adjusting neurotransmission activity, including acetylcholinesterase inhibition as an attempt to increase cholinergic efficacy (Hung and Fu, 2017). However, these treatments only provide temporary relief. Stem cell therapies can be used on the cholinergic system to produce an enriching environment. Studies have shown encouraging outcomes, such as intrathecal injection of human umbilical cord-derived MSCs into AD mouse models (Hernández and García, 2021). The use of this method was marked by a decrease in markers of glial activity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the mouse brain. The mice also showed cognitive enhancements in some areas which included learning and memory.",

        "In another study, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were transplanted from mice with normal TREM2 function into mice with a defective TREM2 gene. This innovative approach resulted in the transplanted cells effectively reconstituting the blood system and integrating into the recipients’ brains, assuming the appearance and function of microglia (Deming et al., 2018). MSCs have shown encouraging outcomes in reducing symptoms in a mouse model of PD. This effect may be due to the secretion of neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, and nerve growth factor, by mesenchymal stem cells (Palanisamy et al., 2023). These factors protect dopamine neurons from apoptosis and stimulate neurogenesis by releasing mitotic and proangiogenic substances. Dopamine progenitor cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells have yielded similar results in a primate PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. These cells survived, matured, and functioned as midbrain dopamine neurons for an extended period without the formation of brain tumors. With higher risk management compared to MSCs-based therapies, clinical studies on human embryonic stem cell/induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cell products have produced good results and have been carried out in countries such as Australia, China, and Japan (Liu and Cheung, 2020). These acts showed that motor neurons had integrated and formed neural circuits in the host. However, moral and religious considerations about the use of fetal tissues are still important matters that must not be ignored as well as the possible risks such as the growth of the graft and the non-neuronal cells in the graft. One study that involved 11 ALS patients was conducted in Spain, and the results demonstrated growth in motor neuron counts following MSC transplantation, as well as an associated reduction in ubiquitin accumulation in the motor neurons. Currently, stem cell-based therapies are being considered as a potential solution for addressing the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD. Human pluripotent stem cells are viewed as a promising therapeutic approach, as they have the potential to differentiate into the necessary cell types for transplantation (Cha et al., 2023). While fetal cell transplantation has shown promise in preclinical and clinical studies, the use of human fetal cells has raised significant ethical and practical concerns. As a result, researchers are focusing on the use of human pluripotent stem cells as a less controversial source of cells for transplantation. However, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed, such as cell survival, integration into the host brain, immunological compatibility, and the risk of tumor formation (Cha et al., 2023). Researchers are actively working to overcome these challenges and refine the use of human pluripotent stem cells for cell replacement therapy.",
        "Nanostructured lipid carriers are a developing method for effective drug delivery, consisting of an unorganized inner lipid structure with solid and liquid lipids. These carriers are used to deliver drugs to the brain for AD treatment, particularly in situations involving microglial activation. Nevertheless, their main limitations are their physical instability and safety concerns, which can be improved by optimizing temperature, storage conditions, and pH levels.",
        "Over the past decade, extensive studies have focused on the role of neuroinflammation in neuronal degeneration. Accumulated evidence strongly supports the idea that neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in both initiating and advancing the process of neurodegeneration and the subsequent loss of neurons in NDs. Furthermore, peripheral inflammation exacerbates neuroinflammatory pathways by activating various components, including glial cells, neurons, complement system, oxidative stress, and cytokines while increasing BBB permeability. Moreover, Suppression of neuroinflammation can alleviate the symptoms associated with NDs and limit the extent of neurodegeneration. Despite emerging therapeutic therapies that provide potentially effective treatment of NDs, a great deal has to be accomplished, and recent interest in preclinical studies and the first translations of some therapies into clinics has paved the way for further development in this direction.",

    "title": "LRP1 is a neuronal receptor for alpha-synuclein uptake and spread. neuronal toxicity are the key pathological features of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Studies have shown that pathological species of alpha-Syn and tau can spread in a prion-like manner between neurons, although these two proteins have distinct pathological roles and contribute to different neurodegenerative diseases. It is reported that the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) regulates the spread of tau proteins; however, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of alpha-Syn uptake and spread, and whether it is also regulated by LRP1, remain poorly understood. METHODS: We established LRP1 knockout (LRP1-KO) human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) isogenic lines using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and generated iPSC-derived neurons (iPSNs) to test the role of LRP1 in alpha-Syn uptake. We treated the iPSNs with fluorescently labeled alpha-Syn protein and measured the internalization of alpha-Syn using flow cytometry. Three forms of alpha-Syn species were tested: monomers, oligomers, and pre-formed fibrils (PFFs). To examine whether the lysine residues of alpha-Syn are involved in LRP1-mediated uptake, we capped the amines of lysines on alpha-Syn with sulfo-NHS acetate and then measured the internalization. We also tested whether the N-terminus of alpha-Syn is critical for LRP1-mediated internalization. Lastly, we investigated the role of Lrp1 in regulating alpha-Syn spread with a neuronal Lrp1 conditional knockout (Lrp1-nKO) mouse model. We generated adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) that allowed for distinguishing the alpha-Syn expression versus spread and injected them into the hippocampus of six-month-old Lrp1-nKO mice and the littermate wild type (WT) controls. The spread of alpha-Syn was evaluated three months after the injection. RESULTS: We found that the uptake of both monomeric and oligomeric alpha-Syn was significantly reduced in iPSNs with LRP1-KO compared with the WT controls. The uptake of alpha-Syn PFFs was also inhibited in LRP1-KO iPSNs, albeit to a much lesser extent compared to alpha-Syn monomers and oligomers. The blocking of lysine residues on alpha-Syn effectively decreased the uptake of alpha-Syn in iPSNs and the N-terminus of alpha-Syn was critical for LRP1-mediated alpha-Syn uptake. Finally, in the Lrp1-nKO mice, the spread of alpha-Syn was significantly reduced compared with the WT littermates. CONCLUSIONS: We identified LRP1 as a key regulator of alpha-Syn neuronal uptake, as well as an important mediator of alpha-Syn spread in the brain. This study provides new knowledge on the physiological and pathological role of LRP1 in alpha-Syn trafficking and pathology, offering insight for the treatment of synucleinopathies. 32224, USA. 32224, USA. 32224, USA.

        "The α-synuclein (α-Syn) is a 140-residue protein encoded by the SNCA gene that is abundantly expressed in the nervous system, predominantly in neurons [1, 2]. The α-Syn protein is enriched at presynaptic terminals where it functions to sustain normal soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-complex structure [3], thus playing important roles in synaptic processes, such as vesicle trafficking/recycling and neurotransmitter release [4–7]. It has been shown that α-Syn protein can be secreted into the extracellular space including brain interstitial fluid (ISF), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma, although the exact mechanism of α-Syn secretion is not well understood [8–11]. Importantly, these secreted soluble α-Syn can be taken up by different cells. Particularly, the oligomeric α-Syn species appear to be prone to uptake and spread from cell-to-cell in a prion-like manner, leading to the templated misfolding of the native forms of α-Syn and formation of α-Syn aggregates throughout the brain, which are the defining pathological features of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy body (DLB) [12–19]. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms of α-Syn uptake and spread remains poorly understood.",
        "The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a transmembrane receptor that belongs to the LDLR family [20]. LRP1 mediates and regulates the endocytosis of  > 30 ligands, including apolipoprotein E (APOE) and amyloid-β (Aβ) [21–27], thus playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [28]. A recent study also identified LRP1 as a key regulator for the uptake and spread of microtubule-associated protein tau [29]. Although tau and α-Syn have key differences in their pathological roles, they do share similarity in cell-to-cell transmission and pathological spread [30]. Tau interacts with LRP1 through lysine residues in the microtubule-binding repeat region [29]. Notably, α-Syn has a similar high content (10%) of lysines as tau. These common characteristics between tau and α-Syn suggest that their uptake and spread might be regulated by the common multiple-functional receptor LRP1.",
        "Here in this study, we tested the role of LRP1 in mediating α-Syn uptake and spread using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived neurons (iPSNs) and a conditional transgenic mouse model. In iPSNs, the monomeric and oligomeric α-Syn uptake was significantly reduced when LRP1 gene was knocked out (LRP1-KO) using the CRISPR/Cas9 strategy. We further confirmed that the α-Syn N-terminal domain interacted with LRP1 through lysine residues. Lastly, we constructed adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to express human α-Syn in neurons and visualized the α-Syn spread in mouse brains. We found that the spreading of α-Syn was reduced in mouse brain with neuronal Lrp1 deletion. Altogether, our results suggest that LRP1 is a key regulator for neuronal α-Syn uptake and spread, providing insight into the mechanisms of α-Syn pathogenesis.",

        "To explore the role of LPR1 in α-Syn uptake, we generated LRP1-KO human iPSCs using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique. Two LRP1-KO iPSC clones were obtained and the LRP1 deletion was validated via Sanger DNA sequencing in each clone (Fig. S1b). Karyotyping in each iPSC clones revealed the preservation of normal number and appearance of chromosomes (Fig. S2a). We further confirmed that the LRP1-KO iPSCs and their parental wild type (WT) iPSCs expressed pluripotent stem cell-specific markers, including Nanog and TRA-1–60 (Fig. S2b). The parental and isogenic iPSC lines were then differentiated into NPCs (Fig. 1a) and we confirmed that all the NPCs from the three lines were positive for neural precursor marker (Nestin) by immunostaining (Fig. 1b). We then differentiated the NPCs into neurons by culturing the cells in neuronal differentiation medium (Fig. 1a). After 14 days of culture, both WT and LRP1-KO cells exhibited a typical neuronal morphology and expressed the neuronal marker (Tuj1), suggesting the successful differentiation of NPCs into neurons (iPSNs) (Fig. 1c).

Three hours after the tau treatment, we harvested the iPSNs and measured the endocytosis of tau proteins by flow cytometry. We confirmed that the amount of internalized tau proteins was reduced by ~ 90% in LRP1-KO iPSNs compared to WT cells (Fig. 1f and g), consistent with what has been reported previously. Together, these data indicate that our strategy of deleting LRP1 in human iPSNs was successful and tau uptake was inhibited by LRP1 deletion in these cells.",
        "To test whether the uptake of α-Syn is through a similar mechanism as tau in neurons, we treated the iPSNs with fluorescently labeled monomeric α-Syn and measured the cellular α-Syn signal by flow cytometry after 3 h of treatment at a concentration of 100 nM. We found that, similar to tau, LRP1-deficiency significantly reduced the cellular uptake of α-Syn (more than 75% reduction) in the iPSNs and consistent findings were observed from two different clones of LRP1-KO iPSNs (Fig. 2a, b, and c). To further confirm that LRP1-KO specifically impacts α-Syn and tau internalization, we treated the iPSNs with fluorescently labeled transferrin and we did not observe any reduction of transferrin uptake in the LRP1-KO iPSNs, as expected (Fig. 2d, e). Next, we tested whether the RAP, a known LRP1 binding antagonist [35], could compete with the α-Syn for neuronal uptake by LRP1. We treated the iPSNs with 100 nM of α-Syn together with different concentrations of RAP ranging from 1.5625 nM to 100 nM. We found that RAP strongly suppressed the neuronal uptake of α-Syn in a dose-dependent manner, whereas transferrin internalization was not affected (Fig. 2f). Together, these results suggest that LRP1 is a key endocytic receptor for monomeric α-Syn in neurons.Fig. 2LRP1 regulates α-Syn uptake in iPSNs. a and b, α-Syn uptake in WT and LRP1-KO iPSNs measured by flow cytometry (100 nM, 3 h of treatment). c Representative images of WT or LRP1-KO iPSNs after α-Syn uptake.

        "Additionally, we tested if LRP1 also mediates oligomeric and fibrillar α-Syn uptake. We treated the iPSNs with 100 nM (monomer equivalent) of fluorescently labeled α-Syn oligomers and sonicated α-Syn PFFs. The structure of α-Syn oligomers and PFFs were confirmed under electron microscopy (EM) (Fig. 2g). We found that LRP1-KO also effectively inhibited the uptake of α-Syn oligomers (~ 50% reduction) (Fig. 2h). However, unlike tau fibrils [29], LRP1-KO only had a mild inhibitory effect on the uptake of α-Syn PFFs (~ 5–10% reduction) (Fig. 2h). These findings indicate that LRP1 may be the primary receptor for the uptake of soluble α-Syn, including monomer and oligomer; and the internalization of aggregated α-Syn may be mediated through a different or multiple mechanisms.",
        "LRP1 contains ligand-binding domains with cysteine-rich complement-type repeats [36]. The aspartic acid residues in each repeat can form acidic pocket responsible for docking the lysine residues on ligands [37]. Monomeric α-Syn is composed of three domains: a lipid binding N-terminus domain (aa 1–60), a hydrophobic non-amyloid component (NAC) domain (aa 61–95), and a negatively charged C-terminus domain (aa 96–140) [2]. α-Syn has a high lysine content (15 lysines out of 140 aa, ~ 10%) with most (eleven) lysines located in the N-terminus, one lysine in NAC, and three in C-terminus (Fig. 3a). To examine whether the lysine residues of α-Syn were involved in LRP1-medicated α-Syn uptake, we capped the amines of lysines on α-Syn with sulfo-NHS acetate and then measured the internalization of α-Syn in the iPSNs. We found that the blocking of lysine residues on α-Syn effectively decreased the uptake of α-Syn in the iPSNs (~ 50% reduction) (Fig. 3b), indicating that lysine residues of α-Syn are critical for LRP1-mediated α-Syn uptake.Fig. 3LRP1 regulates α-Syn uptake via lysine residues in the N-terminus of α-Syn. a Schematic diagram of α-Syn domains highlighting the lysine residues (K). b Uptake of α-Syn and lysine-capped α-Syn in WT iPSNs. c, Uptake of α-Syn-488, N-α-Syn-488 and ΔN-α-Syn-488 in WT and LRP1-KO iPSNs. d Uptake of α-Syn-488 in the presence of excessive non-labeled α-Syn N-terminus (N-α-Syn) or α-Syn lacking N-terminus (ΔN-α-Syn) fragments.

        "We next sought to determine whether LRP1 regulates α-Syn uptake through the recognition of the lysine-rich N-terminus of α-Syn. We employed the α-Syn protein fragments containing only the N-terminus (N-α-Syn) or lacking the N-terminus (ΔN-α-Syn) of full-length α-Syn (Fig. 3a). We then labeled the N-α-Syn and ΔN-α-Syn fragments with fluorescence and examined their endocytosis in iPSNs. We found that LRP1-KO effectively inhibited the uptake of N-α-Syn, to a similar extent as the full-length α-Syn but had no effect on ΔN-α-Syn uptake (Fig. 3c). To further support this finding, we tested whether N-α-Syn or ΔN-α-Syn protein fragment could compete for the uptake of the full-length α-Syn. We treated the iPSNs with fluorescently labeled full-length α-Syn (100 nM), and the five-fold molar excess of non-labeled N-α-Syn or ΔN-α-Syn fragments (500 nM). After 3 h of treatment, we found that the addition of N-α-Syn significantly inhibited the uptake of full-length α-Syn, whereas ΔN-α-Syn had no effect (Fig. 3d). Taken together, these data indicate that LRP1 regulates the uptake α-Syn via lysine residues and N-terminus of α-Syn is critical for LRP1-mediated α-Syn uptake.",
        "Next, we tested whether Lrp1 was also critical for the spread of α-Syn in neurons in vivo using a mouse model. We utilized an AAV approach that allowed us to visualize the α-Syn spread between hippocampus and cortex. The AAV contained dual synapsin promoters that allowed efficient co-expression of GFP and h-α-Syn in neurons (AAV-synapsin-GFP-synapsin-h-α-Synuclein) (Fig. 4a). Neurons that were transduced with the virus could produce GFP and h-α-Syn as two separate proteins; whereas neurons that received h-α-Syn through cell-to-cell spreading would have only h-α-Syn but not GFP protein based on the design of the AAV construct (Fig. 4a). To investigate the role of Lrp1 in α-Syn spread in animals, we used the conditional neuronal Lrp1 knockout mice [38] by crossing Lrp1flox/flox mice with CaMKII-Cre mice to generate Lrp1-nKO (Lrp1flox/flox; Cre+/−) and WT littermate controls (Lrp1flox/flox; Cre−/−). It has been reported that the deletion of Lrp1 driven by CaMKII-Cre was significant in the cortex and hippocampus after 6 months of age [39]. Therefore, we performed stereotactic injection of the AAVs into the right hippocampus of these mice at 6 months of age. Three months after the injection, the mice were euthanized for the evaluation of the h-α-Syn spreading (Fig. 4a). We first confirmed that endogenous Lrp1 protein level was significantly reduced in the Lrp1-nKO mice compared to WT controls measured by Western blotting (Fig. 4b, c). We observed that the GFP signal was exclusively expressed in the hippocampus but not in other brain regions (Fig. 4d), suggesting that only the neurons in this region were transduced by the AAVs as designed (Fig. 4e). Within the hippocampus, both GFP and h-α-Syn signal showed no significant differences between Lrp1-nKO and WT mice, indicating equivalent transduction of AAVs between the two groups (Fig. 4e, f and g). Interestingly, in the cortex above hippocampus, we found neurons that had only h-α-Syn but not GFP signals, suggesting that these neurons received h-α-Syn from hippocampus. The quantification of these h-α-Syn signals in the cortex revealed significant reduction in the Lrp1-nKO mice compared to WT controls (Fig. 4h, i), indicating that Lrp1 deletion suppresses the spread of α-Syn in mouse brain.Fig. 4Neuronal Lrp1 knockout reduces α-Syn spread in vivo. a Schematic drawing for the stereotactic injection of AAV-synapsin-GFP-synapsin-h-α-Synuclein into the neuronal Lrp1 knockout (Lrp1-nKO) mice and wild type (WT) littermate controls, and the experimental workflow. b and c, Western blotting showing the endogenous Lrp1 protein in the cortex of WT (n = 6) and Lrp1-nKO mice (n = 6). d Representative sections showing GFP and h-α-Syn signals in mouse brains.

        "In this study, we investigated the role of LRP1 in α-Syn uptake and spread. We found that LRP1-deficiency significantly reduced neuronal α-Syn and tau uptake using LRP1-KO iPSNs generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 technique. Importantly, we also confirmed that LRP1 mediates α-Syn spread in mouse brains using a transgenic mouse model deleting the Lrp1 gene in neurons. Our findings support the hypothesis that LRP1 is a key regulator for both α-Syn and tau uptake and spread, providing potential therapeutic insight targeting the relevant diseases with α-Syn and tau pathogenesis.",
        "The spread of conformationally distinct pathological protein aggregates between anatomically connected brain regions is a common feature of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including tauopathies and synucleinopathies [30, 40]. Various molecular mechanisms related to the transmission of tau and α-Syn pathology have been reported, including the receptor-mediated endocytosis [29, 41, 42], exosomal transport [43–45], tunneling nanotubes transport [46–48], etc. Among these distinct mechanisms, the LRP1-mediated cellular uptake and spread is shown as a common mechanism for the cell-to-cell transmission of both tau [29, 42] and α-Syn (from this study). As a cell surface receptor, LRP1 regulates the endocytosis of a long list of ligands through direct interaction. We showed that LRP1 interacts with the N-terminus of α-Syn through lysine residues, similar to how LRP1 interacts with tau [29]. We observed that neuronal LRP1 is a key regulator for the endocytosis of monomeric and oligomeric α-Syn. However, different from tau [29], our study shows that the uptake of fibrillar form of α-Syn is less dependent on LRP1 in neurons. It has been reported that in the disease-associated, aggregated state of α-Syn, the N-terminal residues (37 through 97), adopts a β-sheet structure [49]. The finding may suggest that when forming the fibrils, the N-terminus of α-Syn is less exposed therefore the interaction between α-Syn and LRP1 might be limited. A recent study showed that the lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) is a receptor for α-Syn PFFs which mediates the endocytosis and transmission of α-Syn PFFs between neurons [41]. Notably, LAG3 specifically binds to α-Syn PFFs but not monomers. These findings raise the possibility that different forms of α-Syn might be recognized by distinct receptors. Although the role of the uptake and spread of soluble α-Syn monomers is still poorly understood, it is well-documented that the α-Syn oligomers are neurotoxic and are the major α-Syn species serving as the “seeds”, leading to the α-Syn aggregates [12–14, 50, 51]. Therefore, future studies could focus on identifying therapeutic strategies to disrupt the uptake and spread of oligomeric α-Syn species via LRP1-related pathway.",
        "LRP1 is widely expressed in a variety of cell types including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, macrophages, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells. In our study, we demonstrated the role of neuronal LRP1 in mediating tau and α-Syn uptake in neurons. However, whether other cell types, such as astrocyte and microglia, can also take up and spread tau and α-Syn via LRP1-mediated mechanism needs further investigation.",
        "The ε4 allele of the APOE gene (APOE4) is a strong genetic risk factor for Lewy body dementia (LBD) [52, 53]. APOE4 has also been implicated in the progression of cognitive impairment or motor dysfunction within PD [54–61]. Recently, we reported that the presence of APOE4 gene allele exacerbates α-Syn seeding in a large AD cohort and a small cohort of LBD cases [62]. These findings indicate that APOE4 may potentially accelerate α-Syn aggregation and spreading during the disease [63]. In fact, LRP1 is the major metabolic receptor for APOE in the brain [25]. LRP1 mediates the transport of cholesterol and phospholipids into CNS neurons through binding with APOE to support synaptic integrity and plasticity. Therefore, it is possible that APOE4 affects α-Syn aggregation and spreading via LRP1-related mechanisms. Additionally, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), another APOE receptor, have also been shown to be involved in both tau and α-Syn endocytosis [64, 65]. It has been reported that HSPGs bind to α-Syn fibrils and facilitate their endocytosis [64]. LRP1 is known to work in conjunction with HSPGs. For example, LRP1 and HSPGs cooperatively mediate cellular Aβ uptake [66]. How LRP1, HSPGs, and APOE together affect the uptake and spread of tau and α-Syn needs to be further investigated in proper model systems.",
        "In summary, our study defines LPR1 as a key receptor for α-Syn uptake and spread in neurons, presenting a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of synucleinopathies.",

        "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, with an incidence rate of 61.21 and 37.55 per 100,000 people in males and females over 40, respectively [1]. The determinants of this disease continue to be investigated; however, its pathophysiology appears to be multifactorial, with various genetic components [2,3,4] and environmental factors, such as chemical exposure, increasing one’s risk of acquiring the disease [5]. The disease is classically characterized by the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the basal ganglia, but the neurodegeneration extends beyond this structure, causing symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremors, and rigidity [6,7]. The aggregation of α-synuclein in neurons during the development of PD has been implicated as a critical cell death mechanism, although the exact role such aggregates contribute to its pathogenesis remains to be fully elucidated [8,9,10,11]. A crosstalk may exist between the activation of microglia and the overaccumulation or improper folding of α-synuclein. The neurodegenerative cascade may initiate with the migration of microglia to the site of aggregation, where they phagocytose the α-synuclein and induce an inflammatory immune response with downstream effects [12,13].",
        "Inflammatory processes play a major role in the development of PD pathology and its symptoms. Indeed, a high concentration of glutathione peroxidase in glial cells surrounding DA neurons suggests a protective response to oxidative stress [4]. In contrast, higher levels of microglia in older mice are associated with significant neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra [14]. Microglia are key mediators in neuroinflammation, so this finding offered new insight into the role of inflammation in PD [15]. Activated microglia release a flood of cytokines and pro-inflammatory molecules such as IL-1, TNF-α, nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2, and superoxide, all of which can have wide-ranging and damaging downstream effects [16]. Upon the deeper investigation of these cytokines, scientists note that inhibiting inducible nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme responsible for NO production, in rat models of PD induces a significant reduction in neurotoxicity, as shown by the increased integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway and decreased microglial count when compared to control rats [17]. Similarly, NADPH-oxidase participates in the development of neurotoxicity in rat PD models [18]. Aside from microglia, T cells circumvent the blood–brain barrier, infiltrating the brains of PD patients along with splenocytes [19,20]. Indeed, the increased propagation of microglia closely accompanies infiltrating T cells, suggesting that microglia act as the antigen-presenting cells to the T cells after they have crossed the blood–brain barrier [21].",
        "A genetic basis may also mediate the aberrant inflammation in the development of PD. Mice with leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) knock-down display an inhibited microglial inflammatory response when compared to control mice [22]. On the other hand, mice with DJ-1 knock-down astrocytes exhibit significantly more NO production and demonstrate apoptotic behavior, indicating that the gene plays an important role in mediating the inflammatory response [23]. Other genes associated with inflammation and neurotoxicity include PINK1, Parkin, and others not mentioned in this review [24,25,26]. Any attempt to regulate the inflammatory mechanisms in PD should recognize the complexity and multifactorial nature of neuroinflammation.",
        "The aim of this review is to explore the most recent research on the topic of neuroinflammation, which seeks to understand the role of stem cell therapy as a potential therapeutic mediator of the inflammatory damage caused during the natural progression of PD. As later sections will discuss, current therapies can often exacerbate neuroinflammation, and thus finding a treatment that can sequester inflammation and halt the progression of PD would be a major development in the management of the disease.",
        "In the basal ganglia, there are two motor pathways: the direct pathway and the indirect pathway. The direct pathway is excitatory for movement, and involves the striatum inhibiting the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and thus attenuating the inhibitory effect of the GPi on the thalamus. The thalamus is excitatory to the motor cortex, initiating movement. Contrarily, the indirect pathway is inhibitory for movement. The striatum inhibits the globus pallidus externus (GPe), thus attenuating the inhibitory effect of the GPe on the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The STN then excites the GPi, which inhibits the thalamus. The excitatory thalamic signaling to the motor cortex is lost, resulting in the inhibition of movement.",
        "Both the indirect and direct pathways can be impacted by dopamine neurotransmission. Dopamine is an endogenous neurotransmitter, critical for the movement mediated by the basal ganglia. Dopamine is a catecholamine and is derived from L-DOPA via the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase, which itself is derived from L-tyrosine via the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. The substantia nigra pars compacta, located in the midbrain, releases dopamine onto the striatum via the nigrostriatal pathway. Dopamine binds to the D1 and D2 receptors in the striatum; subsequent D1 signaling stimulates the direct (excitatory) pathway, and D2 signaling inhibits the indirect (inhibitory) pathway. Ultimately, this signaling encourages movement initiation.",
        "As noted above, PD presents with the degeneration of DA neurons in the pars compacta, which severely affects nigrostriatal signaling. To ameliorate the motor symptoms of PD, such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, exogenous therapy is utilized. Unfortunately, dopamine cannot cross the blood–brain barrier. Thus, a dopamine precursor, L-DOPA, is administered as the prodrug levodopa, which is converted in the central nervous system to dopamine via DOPA decarboxylase. Of note, levodopa is co-administered with carbidopa, which inhibits DOPA decarboxylase activity in the peripheral tissues, with the goal of increasing levodopa’s bioavailability in the brain. Another therapeutic option is deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS was originally used to localize the target of a resection, but now subcortical neurostimulation is utilized as the first-line surgical treatment of movement disorders [27,28]. DBS stimulation, commonly in the STN or GPi, can modulate signaling within the basal ganglia, thalamus, and motor cortex to improve the motor dysregulation seen in PD.",
        "Inflammation in the setting of PD contributes to the neurodegenerative process and has both acute and chronic phases. As PD worsens, reactive microglia increasingly localize in the substantia nigra, putamen, hippocampus, and cortex [29,30,31,32,33]. As chronic neuroinflammation progresses, microglia lose their reparatory M2 phenotype, and preferentially differentiate to their inflammatory M1 phenotype [34,35]. IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine local to the CNS, released by neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia [36]. IL-6 concentrations are positively correlated with motor scores in PD patients, as measured using the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) [37]. PD patients with fatigue have significantly increased serum levels of IL-6 compared to PD patients without fatigue, as measured with the Parkinson’s Disease Fatigue Scale. Fatigued patients were reported to have worsened signs and symptoms of PD and increased functional dependence [38]. PD patients with higher IL-6 concentrations at baseline were seen to have worsened depression scores two years later [39]. There is a negative correlation between IL-6 levels and scores on the Activities of Daily Living scale, indicating that patients with worsened PD have greater IL-6 concentrations [40]. Interestingly, the literature indicates microglia and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 are involved in both neurodegeneration (typically in chronic settings) and neuronal survival (typically in acute settings) [33,35,41].",
        "Unfortunately, L-DOPA and DBS therapy may worsen neuroinflammation. It is almost ironic that chronic L-DOPA therapy may precede L-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID) [42]. After L-DOPA administration, there is excessive dopamine that saturates vesicles, resulting in a plethora of free cytosolic dopamine that is degraded by monoamine oxidase, leading to an accumulation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species [43,44]. L-DOPA in the setting of PD leads to aberrant D1 signaling in the striatum, with the subsequent hyperactivation of cAMP and PKA [45]. In LID rat models, glucocorticoid treatment reduced abnormal involuntary movements [46], demonstrating L-DOPA’s role in the neuroinflammation seen to worsen Parkinsonism dyskinesia. In the same model, glucocorticoids also normalized the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, in the striatum. Additionally, the direct administration of IL-1 receptor antagonists to the striatum reduced abnormal involuntary movements [46]. Hepcidin, an acute phase reactant synthesized in the liver, is upregulated by IL-6 in settings of inflammation and is responsible for decreasing iron absorption through the destruction of ferroportin and the reduction in iron release from macrophages. Pro-hepcidin serum concentrations were significantly higher in PD patients treated with DBS and pharmacological therapy than in PD patients treated with pharmacological therapy only and in control patients [47,48].",
        "Figure 1 demonstrates the aforementioned contribution of levodopa–carbidopa and deep brain stimulation to neuroinflammation.",
        "While most existing therapies for PD focus on restoring DA neuron loss or using DBS to restore basal ganglia pathways, evolving evidence for PD as an inflammatory disease prompts the use of anti-inflammatory therapies to ameliorate PD progression [49,50]. Several studies in clinical and pre-clinical populations have demonstrated a reduced PD risk and attenuated striatal DA neuron loss using anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, and NSAIDs [51]. Focusing on immune cell proliferation, other groups have designed dendritic cell (DC) vaccines to modulate the typically inflammatory immune response to α-synuclein. In PD, DCs phagocytose toxic α-synuclein buildup to present to lymphocytes in the nearby cervical lymph nodes. T cells respond to the toxic α-synuclein and induce a pro-inflammatory environment [52,53] composed of M1 microglial and A1 astrocytic differentiation and inflammatory cytokines [54,55]. Using primed DCs, differentiation can be swayed towards anti-inflammatory M2 microglia, A2 astrocytic, and Th2 CD4+ T-cell phenotypes [54]. In mice, locomotor function is improved after sensitizing DCs to α-synuclein [56]. Decreased blood DCs are correlated with worse motor impairment, further linking the potential for DC vaccines in modulating PD prognosis [57]. Antibodies also demonstrate similarly successful immunomodulation in animal models of PD [58,59,60]. The administration of anti- α-synuclein antibodies prompts microglial clearance in mouse models of PD, reduces neuronal and glial protein accumulation, and translates to improved functionality [61]. In clinical studies, the administration of α-synuclein monoclonal antibodies, BIIB054 and PRX002, has also shown encouraging results [62,63,64]. Thus, anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals may be important therapies to consider in treating PD, either alone or in combination with other PD therapeutics.",
        "Another promising route for inducing anti-inflammatory responses in PD may use stem cells. Many of the therapeutic effects of stem cells arise from their inherent secreted anti-inflammatory signals among other cell survival molecules, deemed the bystander effects [65]. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), for example, demonstrate anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and regenerative capabilities [66,67]. ESC–MSCs and iPSC–MSCs can inhibit lymphocyte and natural killer cell proliferation, also showing promise for immunoregulatory cell-based therapies [68,69,70,71]. As noted above, exosomes show promise for PD therapies [66]. MSC-derived exosomes have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neurotrophic properties, ultimately leading to functional recovery in animal models of PD [72,73]. An appealing feature of stem cell treatments includes their ability to be modified prior to implantation, for instance, to promote anti-inflammatory actions. A pathway of interest includes interferon-γ signaling via the aforementioned gene, LRRK2. LRRK2 G2019S is the most common genetic mutation associated with inherited PD. In PD patient-derived iPSCs possessing LRRK2 G2019S, IFN-γ signaling increases immunomodulated neuronal damage [74]. MSCs are initially activated by IFN-γ but then exert anti-inflammatory properties [75]. Thus, MSCs may effectively modulate this pathological signaling.",
        "Furthermore, recognizing the underlying DA neuron loss in PD, it is logical to develop treatments that may reestablish these neuronal populations and connections. Cell-based therapies, however, show mixed results in PD, suggesting that additional anti-inflammatory enhancements of the cells may improve their viability. The use of grafts to restore DA neurons shows mixed results, with some reports demonstrating survival, innervation, and improved functionality, and others showing no clinical benefit [76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84]. The studies demonstrating the therapeutic value of stem cells for PD, however, prompt further investigation [85,86]. For instance, exosomes from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) reduce apoptosis and encourage proliferation in an in vitro PD cell culture. In rats, hucMSC treatment shows a similar prevention of DA neuron loss and recovered DA levels [66]. To modulate the altered DA signaling, GABAergic cells from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) can also be targeted. MGE cells show potential to migrate and differentiate into GABAergic neurons, restoring function to mouse models treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a selective neurotoxin of DA neurons to mimic PD [87]. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in rat models of PD can project long distances in the rodent brain to mitigate symptoms, offering hopeful clinical translation [88]. Even closer to the goal of clinical application, human parthenogenetic embryonic stem cell (hPESC)-derived DA neurons improve mobility in monkey models of PD [89]. Additionally, in monkey 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) models recreating PD, human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) improve movement and demonstrate ample neurite formation. Whether grafted from PD or control donors, iPSCs survive, make connections, and lead to functional recovery in monkeys [90]. There is still room for improvement in stem cell PD treatments, as full recovery is not typically achieved in animal models [91,92,93].",
        "A comprehensive list of pre-clinical anti-inflammatory stem cell studies for PD, along with the cell types, dosages, and findings, is outlined in Table 1. The studies were completed in rodent models in vivo (6-OHDA or MPTP technique) or in vitro (A53T α-synuclein overexpressing cells).",
        "While already anti-inflammatory by nature, stem cell treatments may be further enhanced in clinical effectivity and viability by modulating these cells to express additional anti-inflammation properties. The potential for MSCs to impact cell signaling can also be applied to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in promoting DA neurorepair [101]. In patients with a LRRK2 mutation, the neurodegenerative phenotype may arise from altered Wnt signaling. This alteration increases the inhibitory phosphorylation of β-catenin using GSK-3β [102]. Normally, Wnt signaling functions to upregulate β-catenin, and to promote the transcription of genes associated with cellular survival, proliferation, and differentiation [103]. Wnt signaling can be stimulated in PD treatment models using chemical Wnt activators to induce the differentiation of iPSCs to midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons [86,104]. Further enhancing the stimulation of iPSCs into mDA neurons can be carried out through the co-activation of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways. The overexpression of Wnt3a or Wnt5a has been shown to significantly promote ESC differentiation to DA neurons. Compared to the activation of Wnt signaling with only FGF2/FGF8/Shh, adding Wnt5a overexpression enhanced DA neuron production 4-fold [105]. Wnt3a is a component of the canonical route of mDA neurogenesis, and when overexpressed, prevents differentiation from reaching its full potential. However, when Wnt3a is administered first to an undifferentiated cell line to promote proliferation, followed by a “wash-out” phase and then exposure to Wnt5a to promote cell cycle exit and Nurr+ differentiation, a large rise in Tyrosine Hydroxylase + (TH+) DA neurons is seen [105,106]. The neuroregenerative signaling associated with Wnt/β-catenin is further established in MPTP-induced PD mice models. Transplanting neural stem cells (NSCs) to host substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) results in a differentiation of 30% of NSCs to the astrocyte phenotype, allowing the host microenvironment of SNpc to enhance DA neuronal plasticity [97,107,108]. Furthermore, it should be noted that through the antagonism of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in MPTP mice, the therapeutic effects of the transplanted NSCs were abolished [107,108]. In line with previously discussed benefits of anti-inflammatory modulators [65], NSC-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling downregulates microglia and reduces inflammatory mRNA species, including Tnf and Tnfrsf1a, Il1, Nos2, Nfkb, and phagocyte oxidase Cybb (gp91phox) [97]. The potential for unique therapeutic effects from NSC grafts may be realized considering the growing findings of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in PD [109,110]. The use of cell therapies to amplify anti-inflammatory effects is a promising direction for future PD therapies given the immense neuroinflammation and dopaminergic cell death contributing to the disease’s pathophysiology.",
        "Neurotrophic factors may demonstrate protective properties in the setting of stem cell therapy and neurodegenerative disease. Of particular interest, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) nurtures the survival of dopaminergic neurons commonly affected in PD [111]. GDNF signaling is complicated, but importantly, it binds to GDNF family receptor 1α, which subsequently binds to RET, promoting neuronal survival and plasticity [112]. Murine and primate dopaminergic neurons were spared from 6-OHDA- and MPTP-induced cell death upon treatment with GDNF [113,114,115]. Due to the success in animal models, seven human clinical trials have been completed; GDNF was administered, often via putamen infusion, and UPDRS III scores were measured [116,117,118,119,120,121,122]. The results were unfortunately ambivalent; some patients had dramatic improvements in motor function, but in the three studies with placebo control groups, there were no significant differences compared to the treatment group. Neurotrophic factors are a worthy consideration in the treatment of PD through interactions with stem cells.",
        "Exercise and physical therapy are critical strategies known to facilitate endogenous and exogenous stem cells in inducing an anti-inflammatory response, which thus offer potential benefits alongside concomitant stem cell therapy for PD [123,124,125,126,127,128].",
        "Physical therapy and exercise training are significantly implicated in anti-inflammatory activity independent of age [129,130] or overall health status [131]. Physical activity shows benefits in many chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease [132,133], cancer [134,135], and neuroinflammatory diseases [136]. Even exercise surrogates, such as whole-body vibration training, are shown to attenuate inflammation and mobilize stem cell populations associated with vascular health [137]. Further, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the anti-inflammatory role of exercise when controlling for variables such as type, intensity, and volume of exercise, suggesting the mechanism is related to an induction of antioxidant indicators [138]. In mouse models, exercise is implicated in stem cell driven anti-inflammatory effects through changes to the epigenome and transcriptome of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, diminishing the proliferative yield of inflammatory immune cells [139]. Importantly, this finding is subsequently noted in adult populations independent of BMI [140]. The effects on neuroinflammation are mediated through the downregulation of microglia via the direct inhibition or suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines released from a number of cell types [141]. Exercise in both animal models and PD patients has shown promise for lessening the neuroinflammatory processes associated with PD. A rat model receiving unilateral striatal injections of 6-OHDA to induce PD demonstrates that treadmill exercise downregulates the activation of microglia, astrocytes, and oxidative species, and indicates that regular exercise may preserve dopamine levels in PD [142]. This mechanism of reduced neuroinflammation is further elucidated in MPTP-induced mice, in which treadmill exercise downregulates the expression of Toll-like receptor 2 and its downstream molecules, resulting in reduced inflammatory markers, such as TNF-α, NF-κB, IL-1β, and NADPH oxidase, while enhancing plasma dopamine levels and dopamine transporter expression [143]. Moderate exercise also demonstrates reduced levels of TNF-α in patients with PD [144]. Treadmill activity in 6-OHDA rats is also seen to enhance the expression of BDNF, SERCA II, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, all of which decrease neuroinflammation and promote an antioxidant or regenerative response [145].",
        "In addition to neuroinflammatory modulation, exercise has been shown to enhance the viability of endogenous NSCs. Physical exercise is shown in a number of rodent models to trigger the proliferation of endogenous NSCs [146,147,148]. Moderate exercise in mouse models with inflammation-induced hippocampal suppression specifically restores neurogenesis in the dentate area of the hippocampus [149]. Exercise also induces the release of a number of the neurotrophic factors described above, with GDNF concentrations particularly increasing in 6-OHDA rats, MPTP mice, and MPTP monkeys to promote endogenous cell survival for vulnerable dopaminergic neurons [150]. Further, MPTP mouse models placed on an exercise regimen show improved neurogenesis in the subventricular zone, subgranular zone, substantia nigra, and striatum [151]. These effects have been replicated, to a moderate extent, in studies on human PD patients. In these patients, intensive exercise elevates serum BDNF by 16%, enhancing the overall proliferative capacity of endogenous NSCs [152].",
        "Exogenous stem cells also show significant benefits pertaining to exercise therapy. For instance, exercise in mouse models undergoing bone marrow transplantation results in enhanced stem cell survival and recipient blood cell reconstitution [153]. Additionally, physical therapy is proven to be a key aspect linked to inflammation and survival rates in cancer patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [154]. Transplanted exogenous GABAergic neural progenitor cells result in neuropathic pain reduction when coupled with intensive locomotor training [155]. When taken together, exercise therapy is, therefore, a promising field for future research into PD with potential to sequester inflammation-associated cell death and promotes both an endogenous and exogenous stem cell response.",
        "Dietary consumption has recently taken a prominent role in research into neuroinflammation and PD, in which food intake, supplementation, and the gut microbiome may have significant therapeutic potential for decreasing inflammation and enhancing stem cell survival and proliferation.",
        "Amassing evidence indicates the role of diet in suppressing neuroinflammation. The ketogenic diet, consisting of high fats, low proteins, and low carbohydrates, has garnered interest for potential roles in neuroprotection and the inflammatory response. In MPTP-induced mice, the ketogenic diet is shown to be both neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory, alleviating motor dysfunction and inhibiting microglial activation, thereby reducing proinflammatory cytokines in the substantia nigra [156]. This underlying effect is likely attributed, in part, to the elevation of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate, which has been shown to be neuroprotective for dopaminergic models and involved in the downregulation of microglial-induced neuroinflammation [157], having been documented as blocking the NLRP3-inflammasome [158]. Such ketone bodies have also been shown to reduce oxygen-free radicals of the mitochondrial respiration chain in DA neurons, further sequestering PD-associated inflammation [159,160]. Pilot studies in PD patients demonstrate an early confirmation of the role of ketosis in enhancing cognitive performance, though have failed to impact motor function [161]. A number of other dietary patterns and supplementations implicate a role for diet in the neuroinflammation and protection of neural stem cells. For instance, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation in PD patients show reduced inflammation (as measured by C-Reactive Protein) and enhanced total antioxidant response, thereby promoting neuron survival [162]. Polyphenols found in green tea have been studied within PD models, with potential mechanisms that include preventing α-synuclein aggregation (restoring the normal differentiation and apoptotic suppression of endogenous precursor cells associated with the protein) [163,164], increasing tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine levels [165], and sequestering iron (known to trigger oxidative stress, α-synuclein aggregation, inflammation, and neurodegeneration) [166,167]. Resveratrol, a stilbene produced by various fruits and vegetables, is shown to mitigate neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra of PD-induced rats through the downregulation of TNF-α and COX-2 [168].",
        "Additionally, dietary patterns have been implicated in the endogenous stem cell response. For example, intermittent fasting may possess utility in the management of PD, in which mouse models subjected to alternate day fasting prove to be more resistant to the MPTP induction of PD, potentially indicating a neuroprotective effect on existing DA neurons or the enhanced proliferation of precursor cells [169]. Generally, dietary restriction appears to stimulate endogenous stem cell neurogenesis and enhance synaptic plasticity [170], which could represent an important mechanism for resisting injury associated with PD. It is important to note that diets high in antioxidants may also benefit exogenous stem cell survival. For instance, the survival of grafted fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue is increased when a Sprague Dawley rat model of PD is given a diet of 2% blueberries, a fruit high in antioxidants. Therefore, these adjunctive diet regimens can ultimately be applied to human grafting as a PD combination treatment to promote overall stem cell viability [171].",
        "However, diet can also have negative implications for neuroinflammation and PD. Wistar rat models on a high-fat diet for 25 weeks to model obesity demonstrate decreased tyrosine hydroxylase and increased microglial activity, TNF-α, oxidative stress and astrogliosis [172]. Similarly, a mouse model on a similar diet yields a loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra [173]. Nevertheless, given the easily implicated and accessible benefits of certain dietary adjustments, this may be a promising initiative to lessen neuroinflammation and the symptoms of PD.",
        "In recent years, the gastrointestinal microbiome has been found to be increasingly connected with inflammatory processes and the central nervous system. The neurodegeneration association with PD is associated with a shift in the gut microbiome towards a pro-inflammatory environment with bacteria that produce endotoxins (such as LPS) and participate in methanogenesis [174,175]. While the precise mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood, it is known that there exists bidirectional communication between the enteric and central nervous systems, known as the gut–brain axis, which allows for brain lesions to arise from the gut microbiome [176]. As further evidence of this peripheral inflammation infiltrating the brain, recent experimental mouse models show that glial activation is associated with the infiltration of peripheral adaptive immune cells [177], with Th17 lymphocytes invading the substantia nigra and enhancing DA neuron death [178]. Thus, treatment directed towards improving the microbiome, or intake that disrupts it, could have profound implications for PD. For instance, antibiotic and antifungal exposure is shown to increase the risk of PD through microbiome dysbiosis [179]. Meanwhile, a recent case report describes a fecal microbiota transplantation to relieve intractable constipation, an important symptom of PD, which resulted not only in unobstructed defecation but also a nearly two-month reprieve from tremors in the lower extremities [180]. In MPTP-induced mice, such a procedure exhibits neuroprotection through the inhibition of glial cells and neural inflammation [181]. Additionally, smoking and coffee consumption contribute to a reduced risk of PD development over the life course through their impact on the gut microbiome [182]. Probiotics have become important to PD research to mitigate peripheral inflammation, with studies in patients resulting in improved bowel symptoms and improved disease states according to the MDS-UPDRS [183,184,185,186,187]. Overall, diet represents an important approach in mediating inflammation to promote neural stem cell survival and proliferation, while simultaneously opening newfound research avenues related to modulating gut dysbiosis toward the sequestration of peripheral, as well as central, inflammation.",
        "This review summarizes current and experimental treatments for PD, with a focus on stem cell therapies that address the neurotoxicity and inflammation that is prevalent throughout the disease’s progression. The neuroinflammation seen in the disease is the product of the crosstalk between local and peripheral inflammatory pathways, which play a critical and interwoven role in its pathophysiology. Current gold standard treatments, such as levodopa–carbidopa and DBS, can exacerbate inflammation, so patients may benefit from anti-inflammatory cell-based treatments, such as the transplantation of human stem cells or stem-cell-derived DA neurons. Aside from their anti-inflammatory properties, these treatments benefit from their inherent versatility, in some cases allowing them to both downregulate inflammation and simultaneously promote regeneration. Combining existing therapies with emerging stem cell treatments and lifestyle modifications that promote the stem cell-meditated sequestration of neuroinflammation appears to be a promising new direction that warrants further investigation.",

        "Several cellular and molecular hallmarks of aging have been\ndescribed1, many of which\nmay apply to neurons and other CNS cell types. These include genomic instability,\ntelomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, disabled\nmacroautophagy, dysregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, stem cell\nexhaustion, altered intercellular communication, chronic inflammation, dysbiosis and\ncellular senescence. Which of those hallmarks are drivers rather than markers of age\nremains an important question in the field.",
        "The term senescence was first coined in the context of replicative senescence\nmore than 60 years ago by Leonard Hayflick and Paul Moorhead. This landmark study\nrevealed that human fibroblasts have a finite capacity for cellular replication\nin vitro2 due\nto progressive telomere erosion3.\nOver the following years, studies have revealed cellular senescence as a more\ncomplex biological process that is multifactorial and dynamic. Cellular senescence\nis characterised by a permanent state of cell cycle arrest and the secretion of a\nplethora of pro-inflammatory secretory molecules, known as a senescence-associated\nsecretary phenotype (SASP)4. The\nSASP secretome is composed of cytokines including chemokines, proteases and growth\nfactors5. Interestingly,\nthere is considerable overlap in the secretory profile of senescent cells with that\nof activated immune cells in the CNS6,7, suggesting an\ninteraction between senescence and neuroinflammation. Importantly, the secretion of\nSASP factors can trigger senescence in neighbouring healthy cells6,8,\nwhich may be a driver of aging and age-related pathologies. Other common cellular\nand molecular features of senescence include activation of tumour suppressor\npathways (p16/retinoblastoma, p53/p21), resistance to apoptosis, changes in\nmorphology and lysosomal activity, as well as a myriad of epigenetic alterations\n(Figure 1)5,9.\nWhilst cellular senescence plays an essential biological role to protect cells\nagainst toxic stress; for example, during embryogenesis, following cell\ntransformation in cancer or in response to tissue damage, a persistent senescence\nsignature can have deleterious effects in the body and has been linked to\ninflammation, aging and disease10.",
        "While cellular senescence is considered one of the hallmarks of\naging1, many of the other\nhallmarks of aging are also shared with those of cellular senescence (Figure 1) suggesting that those processes are closely\nconnected. For example, several pathways associated with mitochondrial dysfunction\nhave been identified in aging and senescence, as reviewed by Miwa et al11. However, there are also several\ndistinctions between cellular senescence and aging raising important questions such\nas, what is the specific relationship of aging with senescence and vice versa and\nhow are those two features interlinked. For example, senescent cells can arise\nduring embryonic development12,13, while many cells in the aged\nbrain are not senescent but still express certain age-related hallmarks, this\nsuggests that senescence and aging can occur independently in some cases.\nFurthermore, cells that are aging often gradually lose proliferative function while\ncells that become senescent typically arrest from cell cycle permanently.",
        "The accumulation of senescent cells with age and disease has been documented\nin many tissues, including the brain8. An early link between cellular senescence and aging in the\ncentral nervous system (CNS) was suggested by the detection and build-up of\nlipofuscin pigments in the aging rodent brain14. Lipofuscin is an intracellular pigment produced by\noxidative alterations of macromolecules, including lysosomal products15. It is particularly associated\nwith senescence in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons. Recent reports have\ndetermined that numerous cell types in the aging brain including neurons,\nastrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, ependymal cells, smooth\nmuscle cells and endothelial cells can exhibit molecular and transcriptomic\nsignatures of senescence16–18. The involvement of senescent\ncells in neurodegenerative diseases has gained strong interest from findings that\nthe clearance of these cells in mouse models of neurodegeneration can modulate\naspects of disease-associated pathologies19–23,\nsuggesting that cellular senescence may contribute to neurodegenerative dysfunction.\nTherapeutic efforts are now being pursued to assess the potential benefit of\nclearing senescence cells in AD patients using senolytics (SToMP-AD clinical\ntrial)24. However, the\ncell types in the CNS that directly contribute to aging and neurodegeneration, which\nof the various cell types becomes senescent first, as well as the mechanisms by\nwhich they may influence disease progression are not well understood.",
        "Several reports have demonstrated that post-mitotic neurons can acquire\nsenescent characteristics in aging and neurodegenerative states. In this review, we\nwill discuss the evidence supporting neuronal senescence and a potential pathogenic\nlink to neurodegenerative disease. We will focus particularly on modelling neuronal\nsenescence in pluripotent stem cell models and on defining a panel of cellular and\nmolecular hallmarks for the reliable identification of senescent neurons.",
        "A key challenge studying neuronal senescence is the identification of\ncellular and molecular hallmarks that accurately detect senescence. The term\nsenescence is not easily defined, as there is no single gene that reliably\ncaptures the senescent phenotype. As a result, there are numerous markers and\nsignalling pathways associated with senescence which need to be analysed in\ncombination to identify senescent cells in vitro and in\nvivo. To add to this, senescent features within and across cell\ntypes are inherently heterogeneous and different neuronal or glial cell types do\nnot necessarily share the same senescence profile. Some biomarkers of cellular\nsenescence are also expressed in cell types with an inflammatory or stress\nresponse independent of senescence. Collectively, this makes it difficult to\ndetermine if senescent mechanisms are shared across cell types, disease state\nand/or method to induce senescence. Current approaches to measure neuronal\nsenescence therefore entail a plethora of assays to be conducted to identify\nsenescent cells which makes this process highly involved and time consuming (See\nTable 1). A subset of phenotypes\ncommonly associated with cellular senescence have been reported in both aged\nneurons and neurons in neurodegenerative disorders including; activation of\ntumor suppressor pathways, DNA damage response, loss of heterochromatin, loss of\nproteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal abnormalities and SASP (Figure 1, black).",
        "While the accurate identification of senescent cells remains a\nchallenge, the development of eigengene networks and modules has enabled more\nreliable detection of senescent cells in transcriptomic datasets25. Eigengene networks describe\nthe relationship between modules that contain groups of interlinked\ngenes26. These modules\nare defined as eigengenes26\nand are especially valuable in datasets with a low signal to noise ratio. Using\nthis approach, senescent cells can be detected by the expression of genes across\neigengene modules, where each module contains a unique collection of genes\nassociated with senescence25.\nHowever, the composition of modules are highly variable across studies making\ninterpretations and comparisons challenging. To create more consistency in the\ndetection of senescence cells in transcriptomic datasets, a universal senescent\nmodule (SenMayo) consisting of 125 senescence genes, has recently been developed\nfrom existing datasets of aged tissues, including the mouse brain17. The authors demonstrate the\nresponsiveness of the SenMayo gene set in detecting senescence cells across\nmultiple tissues/species and after senescent cell clearance. Of interest, the\npre-frontal cortex and dorsal hippocampal brain regions and microglia were\nidentified to be significantly enriched for senescence/SASP genes in aged mouse\nbrain tissue using the SenMayo module. Therefore, it is currently unclear if\nSenMayo is predictive or suitable to identify neuronal senescence. Another\nrecent study has identified the activation of Senescence Gene (SnG) networks in\nmultiple cell types, including neurons16. Whilst these approaches can identify putative\nsenescent neurons, additional orthogonal validation studies should be performed\nto support the findings.",
        "Following the identification of lipofuscin pigments in the aging rodent\nbrain14, it was not\nuntil much later that the direct co-localisation of senescence markers in\nneurons was documented. These studies identified neuronal senescence in cultured\nprimary CA3 hippocampal36 and\ncerebellar granule neurons from embryonic rodents33, as well as in the hippocampus of aged\nrodent brains36. However, it\nshould be noted that these follow-up studies heavily relied on histochemical\ndetection of SA-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, which has\nbeen criticised as an unreliable biomarker for neuronal senescence when used in\nisolation. It is well known that enhanced expression of SA-β-gal can\noccur during early stages of neuronal development39 and in some brain regions of young\nmice40. This suggests\nthat changes in lysosomal activity based on SA-β-gal expression can arise\nin the absence of bona fide cellular senescence. Nonetheless, subsequent studies\nhave been able to expand on these findings, demonstrating elevation of\nSA-β-gal activity, in addition to other senescence phenotypes, including\nincreased lipofuscin, oxidative stress, γH2AX (indicative of a DNA damage\nresponse), p21 and two SASP factors; IL-6 and MCP-1, in the cortex of aged mice\nand after prolonged culture of primary rodent cortical neurons30,31,34. Importantly,\nin one of these studies, Moreno-Blas et al confirmed that both neurons and\nastrocytes from embryonic rodent cortex cultured in vitro\ndisplay features of cellular senescence, indicated by co-labelling of TUJ1 and\nGFAP with key senescent markers; p21, yH2AX, LaminA/C31. This establishment of neuronal\nsenescence is in part attributed to disturbances in autophagy31, as has been described in\nprimary fibroblasts41.",
        "Progeroid murine models are a valuable tool to investigate the basic\nmechanisms of aging including neuronal senescence. A commonly used model to\nstudy senescence in the brain is the Ercc1−/Δ progeroid\nmouse model, which accumulates endogenous DNA damage due to a deficiency in the\nErcc1-XPF DNA repair endonuclease complex42. The accumulation of DNA damage in\nErcc1−/Δ mice promotes cellular senescence to arise\nat a much faster rate, by 4 months of age they show equivalent accumulation of\nsenescent cells to naturally aged 2.5-year old mice29,42. Ercc1−/Δ mice have an average\nlifespan up to 7 months43. In\nterms of neuronal aging, Ercc1−/Δ mice have\nproportionally smaller brain and spinal cord tissue as a consequence of their\nreduced body size at birth to those from wild-type (WT) mice43,44, as well as an elevation of the senescence markers,\np16INK4A and SA-β-gal, in brain tissue29. Interestingly, in-depth analysis of the\nspinal cord of Ercc1 deficient mice, shows degeneration of motor neurons, along\nwith age-dependent motor abnormalities, astrocytosis and microgliosis43. In addition, targeted\ndeletion of Ercc1 in nigral dopaminergic neurons in mice results in the\ndegeneration of striatal processes and loss of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA)\nneurons45. Whether\ndegeneration of spinal motor or dopaminergic neurons in this mouse model is a\ndirect result of neuronal senescence or a consequence of the defective DNA\ndamage response still needs to be investigated. These findings indicate that\ndeficiency in DNA repair due to a partial loss of Ercc1 functionality can cause\nphenotypes of cellular senescence and accelerate biological age but can also\nalter embryonic development, suggesting that Ercc1 may play an essential role in\nboth aging and development.",
        "An alternative human progeroid syndrome that has been associated with\naging and senescence is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). HGPS is a\nrare genetic condition that leads to the expression of progerin, a truncated,\ntoxic form of Lamin A. HGPS patients have an average lifespan of less than 20\nyears46 and suffer\nfrom a broad range of age-related symptoms in several organ systems. However,\nthey do not display any obvious defects in their cognitive abilities, and the\nbrain appears largely spared from any pathology, a finding that is likely\nexplained by the very low levels of Lamin A expression in the CNS. However,\nmouse models involving forced expression of progerin in the CNS have suggested\nthat progerin may be associated with neuronal senescence. For example, in the\nstudy by Machiela et al., forced expression of progerin in a mouse model of\nHuntington’s disease (HD) triggered expression of the senescence marker\np16INK4A in neurons47. However, another study reported that progerin\nover-expression in hippocampal and cortical neurons resulted in changes in\nnuclear morphology but no obvious other age-related phenotypes48.",
        "Studies of post-mortem tissue have suggested that human neurons can\nbecome senescent in aging and neurodegenerative disease states, but accurate\ndetection of senescent cells has been difficult to date. More recently, Dehkordi\net al., utilised a novel transcriptomic eigengene approach, discussed\npreviously, to more precisely profile both the proportion and identity of\nsenescent cells in the brain of AD patients based on three independent eigengene\nmodules defined as i) cell cycle arrest, ii) stress response and iii)\ninflammatory response25.\nInterestingly, the authors identified that the majority (>97%) of\nsenescent cells in the pre-frontal cortex, across two independent transcriptomic\ndatasets are excitatory neurons, whilst other cell types such as astrocytes,\nendothelial cells and pericytes display an inflammatory profile independent of\nsenescence. It is worth noting that this finding has been replicated in a\nparallel study focused on the same brain region in sporadic and familial AD\npatients6.\nInterestingly, Dekhordi et al reported that most of the identified senescent\nneurons contained tau neurofibrillary tangles, a classical hallmark of AD\npathology25. This\nfinding is based on previous work by the same group in AD transgenic models\nshowing a close association of tau pathology and neuronal senescence20. Interestingly, much earlier\nstudies reported that terminally differentiated neurons in AD brains containing\nneurofibrillary tangles, show abnormal enhanced expression of the cell cycle\nregulator p1649,50. These studies present a first of a kind\nin-human effort and may enable the assessment of other brain regions and/or\ndisease contexts using similar approaches to expand our understanding of the\nsenescent cell types involved in neurodegeneration.",
        "Of interest, another study examining senescence features in a\ntau-dependent mouse model of neurodegeneration found that astrocytes and\nmicroglia show evidence of cellular senescence19. A caveat in this study is the\nidentification of senescent cells using a p16INK4A-reporter despite\nother reports suggesting that tau-dependent neuronal senescence in the human\nbrain is most associated with an increase in p19INK4D\nexpression25. We\nspeculate that the difference in senescent cell types identified between these\nstudies may reflect species heterogeneity, disease severity, the methodology to\ndetect senescence cells and the diversity of senescence markers expressed by\nsenescence cells. For example, a recent report has shown that p21- and\np16-expressing senescent cells are found in distinct cell populations across\naged tissues51 or\nalternatively there may be a temporal component to senescence with p21 initiated\nprior to other cell cycle-dependent genes such as CDKN2A or CDKN2D. These\ndiscrepancies highlight the importance of developing consistent and rigorous\nquantitative methods to measure senescence within the brain that enable the\nfield to distinguish between technical variation in readouts versus biological\ndifferences.",
        "In vitro models of human neurons provide a complimentary\nsystem to study cellular senescence. These are particularly valuable as they can be\ngenerated from specific patients and can be used to explore cellular and molecular\npathological events that may represent early stages of neurological disease onset.\nOne approach to model neuronal senescence is the direct conversion of fibroblasts or\nother aged somatic cell into induced neurons (iNs), which by-passes the pluripotent\nstage and thereby preserves several disease- and age-associated signatures52–54. Indeed, studies of adult individuals and of primary\ntauopathy patient-derived neurons have demonstrated that the isoform (4R) of Tau,\nparticularly critical to disease, can be readily detected in iNs but is typically\nnot observed in iPSC-derived neurons55. In addition, features of cellular senescence have been\nidentified in iNs derived from both sporadic and familial AD patients6. Furthermore, the iNs showed\nsensitivity to senolytic treatment and the enhanced expression of the senescence\nmarker p16 in vitro was correlated to p16 expression in a cohort of\npatient AD brains6. However,\nwhether the full biological process of aging is conserved after iN reprogramming and\nto what extent the retained aging signatures reflect neuronal aging versus aging of\nthe somatic donor cell remains to be fully determined. For example, a recent study\nsuggests that iNs reprogrammed from fibroblasts retain both the donor fibroblast and\nneuronal aging signatures56.\nFurthermore, whilst progress has been made in direct reprogramming technologies, the\napproach still has challenges such as the relatively moderate yield of induced\nneurons, and difficulties in maintaining iNs for extended in vitro\nperiods. One potential solution to improve yield may be the reprogramming of\nfibroblasts into iNs in a 3D environment57. An alternative approach to model neuronal senescence is\nthe directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) into neurons.\nSince the inception of pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines either derived from\nblastocyst stage embryos58 or via\ntranscription factor-based reprogramming from embryonic/adult somatic\ncells59, there has been\nsignificant efforts to generate defined, high-purity neuronal cultures from hPSC. In\nfact, many robust protocols are available for generating a broad range of neuronal\nsubtypes including cortical, dopaminergic or spinal motor neurons among\nothers60–63. However, regardless of the donor age,\ninduced PSCs (iPSCs) and their progeny resemble an embryonic age that is\nindistinguishable from that of their embryonic stem cell-based counterpart64. In essence, donor somatic cells\nundergo cellular rejuvenation by an erasure of their age-associated signatures,\nincluding markers of cellular senescence (Figure\n2)37,64–66. Directed differentiation of hPSCs gives rise to\nembryonic-stage human neurons that progressively mature and age at a pace that\nfollows a human specific clock of development55. For example, the transcriptional profile of directly\nreprogrammed neurons can be segregated from that of PSC-derived neurons by the\nactivation of p16, p21 and several other age-associated markers55. As a consequence, various methods are being\nexplored to introduce aging phenotypes (including senescence) into human PSC-derived\nneurons (see Table 2), to enable more rapid,\neffective and reliable modelling of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases. However,\nwhether the senescence-induced neurons reflect the full biological process of aging,\nor if bona fide cellular senescence can be induced in PSC-derived neurons, will be\ndiscussed below.",
        "Spontaneous emergence of senescent cells has been observed upon in\nvitro culture of hPSC-derived lineages. For example, prolonged culture\nof human cortical organoids has been reported to elicit cellular and metabolic\nstress which can impair cell-type specification67 but also lead to the development of senescence-related\nfeatures28. Aged cortical\norganoids exhibit enhanced SA-β-gal lysosomal activity, as well as elevated\nexpression of factors known to regulate cell cycle arrest (p21/p16) and SASP (IL-8,\nIL-1α, IL-1β) typically by 10 weeks28. Significant up-regulation of multiple\nsenescence-associated genes (ELMOD1, SLC9A7, TAP1, CCND3, LRP10) across 3\nindependent scRNAseq datasets of cortical organoids have also been noted28,68–70.\nSimilarly, cultured cortical neurons (>10weeks) display increased\nSA-β-gal and p16, with a notable reduction in telomere fluorescence intensity\nand neurite diameter28. However,\nin all those instances, it could be argued that prolonged culture leads to\nstress-induced expression of senescence markers rather than modelling physiological\naging or senescence.",
        "In recent years, there has been a significant advancements in the\ntransplantation of hPSC-derived neuronal subtypes61,62,71–74 which may offer a more physiologically relevant model to\nstudy aging or senescence. One concern is the relatively immature age of the\nengrafted neurons (even at study endpoints), which could potentially be overcome by\nthe generation and transplantation of iN-derived organoids that retain\nage-associated signatures, but this strategy has not yet been demonstrated.",
        "An alternative approach to accelerate cellular age in hPSC-derived lineages\nis to manipulate genes associated with premature aging syndromes, such as\nHutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Forced expression of progerin has been\nsuggested to trigger neuronal senescence in a mouse model of Huntington’s\ndisease but results have been inconsistent across studies (discussed above). In\nhPSC-derived populations, over-expression of progerin has been shown to induce\nmultiple age-related phenotypes in fibroblasts, mDA neurons and striatal neurons\n(Table 2)37,47.\nHowever, in contrast to fibroblasts, progerin treatment in iPSC-derived mDA and\nstriatal neurons did not robustly upregulate the senescence marker SA-β-gal\nand heterochromatin markers (HP1γ, H3K9me3), and Lap2α were unchanged,\ndemonstrating a distinct cell-type specific response to progerin37. However, progerin-induced aging-like\nphenotypes in iPSC-derived dopamine neurons resulted in some dopamine-specific\nage-related phenotypes including accumulation of neuromelanin and progressive loss\nof tyrosine hydroxylase expression in grafted neurons, as well as a pronounced\ndendrite degeneration phenotype in vitro37. These characteristics were exacerbated in\ndopamine neurons derived from two genetic PD iPSC models. While the progerin\napproach can model several aspects of neuronal aging, it does not capture the full\nrange of age-related phenotypes. Furthermore, it requires ectopic expression of\nprogerin in neurons given the low endogenous levels of Lamin A. Accordingly,\nprogerin-based models may represent a pathological form of aging rather than simply\naccelerating the physiological aging process. Investigation into other premature\naging candidates, such as ERCC1 (discussed above), that specifically cause\naccelerated senescence, may be particularly relevant, though the complete loss of\nERCC1 triggers neuronal death rather than senescence75.",
        "Another gene shown to be involved in the process of aging is the longevity\ngene Klotho. Klotho (KL) is readily detectable in many tissues of the body\n(including several brain cell types) and expression levels progressively decline\nwith advancing age76–78. Expression of Klotho in the CNS\nis most prominent in the choroid plexus, with lower expression in Purkinje neurons\nof the cerebellum, cortical neurons, spinal motor neurons, hippocampal neurons,\ndopaminergic neurons and oligodendrocytes78,79. The relevance of\nKlotho in brain aging has been studied using klotho-deficient mice which rapidly\ndevelop cognitive deficits and exhibit selective loss of dopaminergic\nneurons80. Dopaminergic\nneuron loss is thought to be a result of increased oxidative stress80. In addition, KL deficient mice\nhave significantly fewer Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum, decreased\noligodendrocyte number and reduced anterior horn spinal MNs, and show a reduced\nlifespan77. Cellular\nsenescence is yet to be reported in Klotho-deficient mice. A recent report has\ninvestigated the impact of perturbing Klotho expression in hPSC-derived cortical\nneurons. Interestingly, transcriptional repression of Klotho in cortical neurons\naccelerated culture-induced neuronal senescence via upregulation of p21 and\np16INK4A in both 2D neurons and organoids28. Conversely, up-regulation of this gene\nattenuated cellular senescence in cortical neurons.",
        "Another approach to study neuronal senescence is to investigate genetic\nvariants associated with neurodegenerative disease. SATB1, a master transcriptional\nregulator, has recently been identified as a risk factor for Parkinson’s\ndisease (PD)81,82. Interestingly, post-mortem studies of PD\nbrains have noted a reduction in SATB1 activity within brain regions associated with\nPD pathology83. Genetic deletion\nof SATB1 in human embryonic stem cell-derived DA neurons, but not cortical neurons,\ncan induce a cellular senescence transcriptional program via a p21-dependent\nmechanism. These neurons display a host of common hallmarks that are central to\ncellular senescence (see Table 2) and show\nsensitivity to a diverse panel of senolytic compounds32. Importantly, the senescent phenotype can be\nmostly reversed by inhibition of p21 in SATB1KO neurons32. The cell type specific response\nto loss of SATB1 raise the question whether subtypes of neurons are more vulnerable\nto senescence and which of the genes that regulate neuronal senescence are specific\nto a given neuronal subtype. It also remains to be explored if induction of cellular\nsenescence by loss of SATB1 can accelerate the presentation of disease phenotypes in\nPD DA neurons.",
        "Several pharmacological treatments that elicit senescence phenotypes have\nbeen explored in hPSC-derived neurons. The prolonged exposure of hPSCs to BIBR1532,\nan inhibitor of telomerase catalytic activity, during both the pluripotent stage\nprior to differentiation and maintained during dopamine neuron differentiation,\nresult in neurons with an increased percentage of critically short telomeres. Those\nneurons derived from BIBR1532 treated cultures also show other age-related features,\nsuch as increased DNA damage, a reduced number and length of dendrites and increased\nmitochondrial ROS38. Several of\nthese aging phenotypes are observed during cellular senescence but additional\nprofiling of markers central to cellular senescence, such as SA-β-gal,\np16/p21/p53 and SASP, will be required to address whether telomere attrition in\nhPSCs by inhibition of telomerase catalytic activity results in neurons that exhibit\nbona fide senescence. Interestingly, the same BIBR1532 treatment paradigm led to\npremature loss of TH expression in vitro similar to the findings\nfollowing progerin overexpression in grafted dopamine neurons.",
        "A recent drug screen on neonatal fibroblasts has identified a series of\nsmall molecules that can induce senescence features without causing significant DNA\ndamage35. From these\ncandidates, the authors identified that the combination of SBI-0206965 (autophagy\ninhibitor), Lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor) and O151 (DNA glycosylase-1\ninhibitor), named SLO, effectively enhanced neuronal senescence. Specifically,\nSLO-treated neurons elicited SA-β-gal with a loss of H3K9Me3, HP1γ and\nLap2β expression. Further assessment revealed disrupted proteostasis with\nmore extensive protein aggregation and mitochondrial defects, but no changes in\nLamp2A. These phenotypes were validated in both cortical and motor neurons.\nSLO-treated cortical neurons had a high overlap of age-related transcripts with iNs\nderived from aged fibroblasts and with aged cortex, as well as up-regulation of\ngenes involved in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome. They further tested the\ninfluence of senescence on disease-related phenotypes in motor neurons (MNs) from\nTARDP mutant ALS and isogenic iPSCs. SLO treatment accelerated ALS-specific\nneurodegeneration in TARDP MNs, most strikingly by inducing increased levels of\nphosphorylation of TDP43, but also protein aggregation and axonal\ndegeneration35.",
        "Another means to induce aging is to manipulate the epigenetic status of the\ncell. As we age, the epigenetic landscape changes in the human body as a consequence\nof dsDNA breaks, which causes chromatin modifying proteins to relocate to the site\nof these breaks as a part of the DNA repair machinery5. This results in a loss of epigenetic\ninformation which appears to accelerate aging. A novel reversible method to\nmanipulate this process, defined as ICE (inducible changes to the epigenome), has\nrecently been investigated in a mouse model to accelerate hallmarks of aging,\nincluding senescence, which leads to an advancement of the DNA methylation clock\namong other phenotypes84. While\nthis approach has yet to be applied for hPSC-derived neurons, it is an exciting\navenue for further investigation.",
        "Of interest, a recently established transcriptional method to score cellular\naging (RNAge) has confirmed that several of the paradigms (SATB1 loss, progerin\nover-expression and chemical induction of senescence – SLO) discussed in the\nreview increased cellular age in hPSC-derived neurons56.",
        "While the primary focus of this review is neuronal senescence in aging and\nneurodegenerative disease, there are other cell types of the CNS that can be derived\nfrom iPSCs and have been shown to express features of cellular senescence in aged\nand neurodegenerative states23,85,86. However, distinguishing senescence-associated glia from\nother primed and reactive inflammatory states remains a challenge for the field, as\nreviewed by Ng et al.,7.\nNonetheless, it will be important to determine which of these senescent cell types\nare drivers of neurodegenerative disease and which play the most critical role in\nneurodegeneration.",
        "Each of the strategies to trigger age-related markers or senescence in\nhPSC-derived neurons caused a unique subset of hallmarks that are associated with\ncellular senescence (Figure 2). However, the\nheterogeneity in cellular phenotypes is not surprising given the high phenotypic\ndiversity present in other senescent cell types and given the distinct methods to\ninduce and measure senescence16,87,88. Furthermore, it also seems likely that neuronal subtype\ncontributes to whether a given senescence marker is induced or not. These findings\nhighlight the complexity and intricacies of cellular senescence, and it remains to\nbe determined if any of these approaches can reproducibly model the full biological\nprocess of senescence in a manner that reflects age-related senescence in human\nneurons. It is possible that each inducer only mimics aspects of the process and\nthat a combination of methods will be required to induce a more complete set of\nneuronal senescence markers. All of those efforts in hPSC-derived neurons will\ncomplement the use of directly reprogrammed iNs that retain age-related senescence\nfeatures but present challenges in recreating the full scale and diversity of\nneuronal and glial cell types available using hPSC-based approaches.",
        "More broadly, the relatively immature state of neuronal subtypes derived\nfrom hPSC is now widely recognized as a challenge for the study of age-related\ndiseases. We have discussed some of the preliminary efforts to induce neuronal\nsenescence in patient-derived iPSCs which can advance the appearance of some\ndisease-related phenotypes in PD and ALS35,37,38. However, this field is still at its infancy\nand many open question remain such as: is cellular senescence a cause or consequence\nof neurodegenerative disease and how does it relate to disease progression, can\nsenescence spread from neuron to neuron or across other cell types in the CNS and\nhow does senescence impact neuronal function and age-related synaptic changes (see\nFigure 3 for hypothetical mechanisms of how\nneuronal senescence could be implicated in disease). Finally, it will be important\nto determine whether senescence is reversible, and to assess the therapeutic\npotential of senolytic drugs in modulating neuronal senescence, and if the\nelimination of senescent cells, including senescent neurons, will be the most\nbeneficial approach.",
        "In this review, we have highlighted a panel of senescence-related markers\nthat can be used to identify senescence neurons. However, we recommend that future\nstudies will have to standardize those readouts and to systematically compare the\nsame readouts across the many induced aging paradigms. Furthermore, it will be\nimportant to move beyond this framework and to include analyses of neuronal function\nthat may arise in response to cellular senescence – such as modifications to\nneuronal activity, the status of synaptic protein(s) and potentially adverse cell to\ncell interactions via SASP. Finally, it will be critical to apply strategies for\ncontrolled manipulation of the epigenetic landscape in altering senescence induction\nand the functional consequences thereof.",
        "Cellular senescence in neurodegenerative disease is an emerging field, but\nthere are still many challenges that hamper progress. Lacking in the field is a\nclear definition of senescence at the cellular, molecular, transcriptional and\nepigenetic level in both the mouse and human brain. Efforts to achieve this goal at\nsingle cell resolution are currently underway, particularly to identify conserved or\nunique senescence signatures across cell types and identify biomarkers with improved\nspecificity across human age. Several initiatives have been established to address\nthe challenges associated with cellular senescence including the NIH SenNet\nconsortium89.\nTranscriptomic/proteomic atlases are also being developed to stratify senescence\ngenes across multiple healthy human tissues and for various senescence\ninducers16,87,88.\nOne of these reports identified three novel SASP genes (GDF15, STC1, SERPINS) which\nsignificantly correlate with age of human plasma and overlap with several aging\nmarkers90. Expansion of\nthese atlases to encompass neurons and various neuronal subtypes (and other known\nsenescent CNS cell types) and to cross-compare those data with data from\niPSC-derived neurons are needed.",
        "Epigenetic clocks have been developed as a tool to predict biological age\nbased on changes in DNA methylation from embryogenesis to old age. These clocks can\nbe applied across multiple tissues, including the brain91–93 and tailored to capture DNA-methylation based, age-related\nchanges in iPSC and iPSC-derived neurons94. The recent development of a universal mammalian clock from\nthe Horvath group identified clock loci associated with genes linked to cellular\nsenescence, such as ERCC1 and BDNF95–97,\npresenting a novel tool to study the link of age- and senescence-related\nchanges.",
        "Of relevance to modelling neuronal senescence in vitro, it\nwill be important to assess if the senescent profile of neurons from human brain\ntissues are comparable to in vitro, patient-derived iPSC neurons. A\nconvergence of approaches and methods will be required to eventually disentangle\nphenotypic diversity of senescent states that arise depending on the neuronal cell\ntypes studied and the strategies used to trigger senescence-like states in\nhPSC-derived lineages. Such efforts will be critical to harness the full potential\nof those approaches in modelling late onset neurological disorder.",

        "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that results from progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. This loss is associated with characteristic motor dysfunction, including bradykinesia, rigidity, and rest tremor. The molecular hallmark of PD is the presence of Lewy bodies (LBs) composed of the alpha-synuclein (α-syn) protein in the substantia nigra and cortical regions of the brain (Dauer & Przedborski, 2003). Treatment with the dopamine precursor levodopa can improve symptoms, but does not prevent DA neuron destruction (Kim et al., 2002). Although no cure is currently available, cell-based therapy (CBT) (in which cellular material, usually intact, living cells such as T cells capable of fighting cancer via cell-mediated immunity, is injected into the patient during immunotherapy) is considered one of the most promising methods for eradicating PD (Sonntag et al., 2018). Currently, stem cells are among the best cell sources for CBT.",
        "Pioneering studies on the application of CBT in rodent models provided invaluable information on neuronal survival, migration, and post-grafting integration (Kim et al., 2013). Nevertheless, clinical translation of CBT for PD requires further investigation and evaluation in different species. Experiments in NHP models are ideally suited for such exceptional and invasive brain therapy (Didier et al., 2016).",
        "Stem cells have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into multiple cellular lineages, offering an enormous pool of resources for therapeutic applications such as autologous stem cell transplants (Drouin-Ouellet, 2014). Using stem cells to treat neurodegenerative diseases has become an area of intense interest. Current clinical applications of stem cells have targeted Alzheimer’s disease (Kwak et al., 2018), PD (Parmar, 2018), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Robinson, 2018), and multiple sclerosis (Shirani & Stuve, 2018), and are predicted to increase in coming years. Furthermore, SCT has been proposed to counteract the characteristic massive loss in DA neurons observed in PD (Chiu & Hall, 2006).",
        "Since the first clinical trials in the late 1980s using fetal midbrain tissue to replace lost DA neurons, hundreds of patients worldwide have been subjected to neural fetal tissue grafting, with many showing long-term graft survival, good clinical outcomes, and physiological release of dopamine over decades (Barker et al., 2017). Furthermore, the derivation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (Thomson et al., 1998) provided a new scalable cell source for stem cell therapy (SCT), which may potentially replace fetal tissue. However, the road to clinical application of these cells has proven to be long, involving a number of key steps such as gaining control over cell subtype differentiation, producing safe and efficacious cells, adhering to good manufacturing regulations, scaling-up production processes, and obtaining regulatory approval of the final cell products.",
        "Although CBT is the most promising treatment for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, animal experiments remain limited. NHPs exhibit great similarity to humans in regard to genetics, brain/cognitive function and development, organs, metabolism, and drug susceptibility (Zhang et al., 2014). Therefore, experimental results from NHP-based studies are critical and convincing.",
        "Since the early 1980s, scientists have relied on NHP models to assess the potential benefits of CBT for PD (Cowen, 1986). Compared to rodents, PD-relevant behavioral outcomes, such as fine motor skills, can be easily tested in NHPs (Camus et al., 2015). Clinically relevant behavioral parameters are critical for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic strategies, such as the choice of intracerebral grafting targets (Bentlage et al., 1999; Kauhausen et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2010). NHPs and humans show similar organization of the neo-striatum, with the caudate nucleus and putamen clearly delineated by white matter tracts of the internal capsule (Howson et al., 2019). In contrast, in rodents, the transecting white matter tracts of the internal capsule are broken into bundles (pencils of Willis) that perforate the entire striatum without presenting a distinct physical barrier for cell distribution (Coizet et al., 2017). Thus, NHP models have facilitated CBT progress toward clinical application.",
        "Humans and NHPs possess similar behavioral elements, physiology, anatomy, biochemistry, organ mechanisms, and immune functions (Vierboom et al., 2012). Therefore, NHP models enable the translation of therapy-focused research from small animals to humans. In particular, NHP models of human disease provide exceptional opportunities to advance SCT by addressing pertinent translational concerns associated with this research, including the application of autologous/allogeneic-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cellular products, immune responsivity, clinical delivery techniques, and evaluation of candidate cell line profiles following transplantation (Wang et al., 2017; Wei et al., 2016). Furthermore, NHP models offer unique possibilities to evaluate the complexity of the biochemical, physiological, behavioral, and imaging end points relevant to current human conditions (Koprich et al., 2017).",
        "Given the ethical concerns, expense of specialized equipment, and necessity of highly trained staff, the value of using NHPs must be carefully assessed. Well-designed and less resource-demanding studies in small animal models, such as rodents, are essential for ultimately translating NHP model research into human patient therapy. Each disease-specific research community should focus on developing relevant NHP models that advance the translation of stem cell research and therapy.",
        "In this review, we discuss the role of NHP models in developing SCT for PD, stem cell types that can be used for transplantation, and value of NHP studies in translating these therapies for clinical application.",
        "The most commonly used neurotoxins for generating models of PD are 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).",
        "6-OHDA models",
        "As a neurotoxic compound, 6-OHDA induces cell death via oxidative stress after uptake by the catecholamine transport system (Zhou & Cheng, 2019). 6-OHDA is commonly used in rodents as they are much less sensitive to MPTP compared with humans and NHPs. Although many researchers have reported that 6-OHDA can cause cell death in vivo (Bernstein et al., 2011; Tobón-Velasco et al., 2013), several studies have found no markers of cell death upon treatment with this compound (Kostrzewa, 2000), suggesting possible phenotype loss. In the application of 6-OHDA for PD model development, the severity of the resulting disease depends on the number, size, and location (e.g., striatum, substantia nigra, or medial forebrain bundle) of 6-OHDA injections (Emborg, 2004). Eslamboli et al. (2003) applied nine striatal injections of 6-OHDA to model PD in common marmoset monkeys; however, due to the spontaneous recovery of symptoms 10 weeks after surgery, Eslamboli et al. (2005) developed a new model using 18 unilateral intrastriatal injections.",
        "One drawback of the above model is the numerous intracerebral needle passages necessary for appropriate 6-OHDA distribution to decrease the extent of spontaneous recovery (Santana et al., 2015). As with other stereotaxic procedures, this model requires surgical settings and trained personnel to perform brain surgery and provide recovery care.",
        "Administration of MPTP is a classic method for generating PD due to the selective toxicity of this chemical toward DA neurons (Jiang & Dickson, 2018; Lei et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015a; Su et al., 2015). It is historically important in animal models of PD and provides utility to test certain CBT parameters. After crossing the blood-brain barrier, MPTP is transformed by monoamine oxidase B into its active metabolite, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+), which is then carried by dopamine transporters into DA neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), where the compound blocks mitochondrial complex I activity (Huang et al., 2018). Although it has limitations, MPTP treatment is the current standard in NHPs. The discovery of this mechanism of action in the 1990s paved the way for subsequent studies exploring mitochondrial function in PD and provided a prominent animal model of the disease (Emborg, 2017).",
        "Paraquat is an important member of the bipyridylium family of broad-spectrum herbicides and is commonly used to control pests in important crops such as soybeans, sorghum, sugar cane, cotton, and corn. It interferes with photosynthetic electron transport and reduces oxygen to superoxide free radicals, leading to membrane rupture and leaf desiccation (Sarwar et al., 2015). Many countries have already banned paraquat due to its acute pulmonary and cutaneous toxicity or established restricted-use measures, such as limited concentrations of the active ingredient in formulated products and manipulation by licensed mixers and ground applicators only (Kuo & Yu, 1991). In experimental models, paraquat has been linked to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, and aggregation of α-syn proteins in DA neurons ((Kuter et al., 2007,  2010). However, the mechanism used by paraquat to access DA neurons is not yet fully understood (Vaccari et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017).",
        "As a mitochondrial toxin, rotenone can produce dose-dependent systemic toxicity and mortality (Sanders & Greenamyre, 2013). Following delivery of this compound (via osmotic minipump), a proportion of animals becomes parkinsonian, with different degrees of nigrostriatal lesions (Perier et al., 2003). Furthermore, rotenone (2–3 mg/kg/day) is reported to elicit selective nigrostriatal degeneration, generally without nonspecific lesions (Trigo et al., 2018). For example, Cicchetti et al. (2010) found that rotenone caused severe digestive issues, with an enlarged stomach full of undigested food, following systemic application. Although it was not recognized as such, this may have been the first indication that rotenone can reproduce the lesser-known gastrointestinal symptoms of PD, such as gastroparesis (Johnson et al., 2018). Indeed, Bové & Perier (2012) reported that rotenone accurately recapitulates the pathological and functional features of parkinsonian gastrointestinal impairment.",
        "Although the reasons for the discrepancies between research results are uncertain, recent refinements of the rotenone model have made it more reproducible and reduced the number of nonspecific toxicities. Smirnova et al. (2016) demonstrated that withdrawal of rotenone led to counter-regulation of mir-7 and the ASS1, CTH, and SHTM2 genes, suggesting a possible role of these genes in direct cellular responses to this toxicant and the suitability of the model at addressing the processes of resilience and recovery in neurotoxicology and PD. Furthermore, Cimdins et al. (2019) used rotenone, as a potent complex I-specific mitochondrial inhibitor, to determine the neuroprotective effects of APP and sAPPα in vitro, in neuronal cell lines over-expressing APP, and in a retinal neuronal rotenone toxicity mouse model in vivo. Overall, it is difficult to effectively model all aspects of a complex, age-related human disease such as PD in rats. Even genetically accurate models of PD have met limited success in replicating key behavioral and pathological features of the disease. Nevertheless, a great deal has been learned–and remains to be discovered–about the pathogenic mechanisms of PD using rotenone models of the disease.",
        "Genetic NHP PD models have been generated previously by intracerebral injection of viral vectors encoding mutant α-syn or administration of LB extracts (Marmion & Kordower, 2018). Nigral overexpression of human wild type or mutant A53T α-syn, induced by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, has been shown to induce PD-like motor symptoms, significant nigral DA cell loss, and α-syn aggregates in common marmoset monkeys (Eslamboli et al., 2007; Kirik et al., 2003). AAV and lentiviral vectors encoding A53T α-syn have also been used in cynomolgus (Koprich et al., 2016) and rhesus monkeys (Yang et al., 2015). In both studies, expression of A53T α-syn led to nigral cell loss and α-syn accumulation and aggregation, though without behavioral changes. Furthermore, while AAV-induced overexpression of A53T α-syn and parkin, another PD-implicated protein, in cynomolgus monkeys led to a decrease in striatal DA markers and α-syn accumulation and phosphorylation, no PD motor symptoms were observed (Recasens et al., 2014). Notably, nigral injection of AAV expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock down α-syn in vervet monkeys induced a region-specific decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive nigral cell number and striatal innervation compared to animals that received scrambled shRNA, although no behavioral changes were reported (Collier et al., 2016). Intracerebral inoculation with α-syn fibrils has been extensively used in rodents, but not yet in monkeys (Luk et al., 2012; Paumier et al., 2015). On the other hand, cadaveric Lewy body extracts have been injected into the striatum and nigra of cynomolgus monkeys with and without previous treatment with MPTP (Recasens et al., 2014), which induced a variable decrease in striatal and nigral DA markers and an increase in α-syn expression, but no PD motor symptoms. It should be noted that, with the exception of AAV-mediated α-syn studies in marmosets, all investigations on genetically produced models have been performed using only a few subjects. Therefore, further characterization and validation of such models is necessary before they can be used as robust testing platforms for SCT.",
        "Transgenic NHP models induced by injection of NHP oocytes with lentiviral vectors encoding PD-relevant proteins with mutations of interest have emerged in recent years. For example, transgenic rhesus monkeys overexpressing mutant A53T α-syn have been reported (Niu et al., 2015), with some behavioral deficits observed at 1.5–2.5 years of age. New technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9-genomic editing also present an opportunity to generate NHP models with PD-associated mutations expressed at physiological levels, which may help clarify the mechanism of disease onset, including the development of motor and non-motor symptoms (Handschel et al., 2011; Luol et al., 2016). These novel NHP models may provide clues to better understand α-syn-related disorders and enable the development of SCT to treat them.",
        "Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have attracted considerable attention as an alternative source for the generation of DA neurons. Handschel et al. (2011) described a technique for culturing ESCs in the absence of artificial scaffolds, which generated mineralized micromasses. This technique made it possible for ESCs to proliferate, which is a prerequisite for CBT. Due to their pluripotency and highly proliferative properties, ESCs can give rise to any type of cell in the body, including DA neurons (Thomson et al., 1998), which can be produced in sufficient numbers for transplantation therapy. ESCs are associated with the risk of tumorigenesis due to genomic instability in culture (Zhao et al., 2015), even if the cells appear to fully differentiate into DA neurons in vitro before transplantation (Luk et al., 2012). Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2C) directs the differentiation of mouse ESC-derived neural precursors into neurons (Skerjanc & Wilton, 2000). Furthermore, MEF2C confines hESCs to the neuronal lineage, which can be used to generate neurons and avoid tumor formation for use in SCT (Eslamboli et al., 2005). Human and rodent ESC-derived DA neurons have been shown to survive transplantation into the striatum of parkinsonian NHPs and generate a degree of functional recovery (Hayashi et al., 2013).",
        "Nevertheless, studies have shown that the survival of ESC-derived DA neurons post transplantation is relatively low. Li et al. (2017) demonstrated that hESCs differentiated into DA neurons when co-cultured with PA6 cells, with almost 92% of hESC colonies containing cells positive for TH, a critical catecholaminergic enzyme, after three weeks of differentiation.",
        "Two potential drawbacks may limit the therapeutic application of ESCs. First, the generation of hESCs requires fertilized eggs from donors and the destruction of early embryos, which raises a plethora of ethical and legal concerns. Second, hESC-derived grafts are allogeneic to recipient patients, thus making immuno-suppressive regimens necessary (Leng & Tian, 2016). Despite these limitations, hESCs are currently the “gold standard” of SCT for PD, and hESC-derived midbrain DA (mDA) neurons are currently being developed for clinical trials in the USA and Europe (Kern et al., 2018; Weick et al., 2011). Chinese scientists have also initiated clinical trials of ESC-based therapy for PD (Cyranoski, 2017).",
        "iPSCs are adult somatic cells that are converted into pluripotent cells via the introduction of specific transcription factors found in normal PSCs. The cells can be differentiated into most somatic cell types and are self-renewable (Zhang et al., 2019). As recently as five years ago, direct therapeutic treatment of PD through transplantation of iPSCs was not feasible. Transplantation faced many problems such as low efficiency, virus requirements, and teratoma development (Li et al., 2015b). Attempts to use xenogeneic materials resulted in contamination by animal-source pathogens, which can cause an immune response after transplantation in humans (Bergstrom et al., 2011). However, researchers have since developed a xeno-free medium alongside a feeder-free culture system and cre-mediated excision of reprogramming factors to obtain transgene-free iPSCs with improved efficiency (0.15%–0.3%) (Lu et al., 2014). Although more testing is needed, especially in animal models, these results suggest that iPSCs are more viable than previously thought from an efficacy standpoint (Li et al., 2015b).",
        "Recent progress in clinical treatment shows promise in animal models of PD. For example, Han et al. (2015) found that human iPSCs transplanted into 6-OHDA-induced parkinsonian rats improved functional “rotational asymmetry” defects several weeks after transplantation. In another study, iPSC-derived DA neurons were transplanted into parkinsonian cynomolgus monkeys and survived for two years over the length of the study; in addition, the transplanted DA neurons reinnervated the host brains, grew into the putamen, and showed long-term viability (Hallett et al., 2015). Although the results were only positive for one of the three tested monkeys, the study demonstrated that iPSC-derived DA neurons can be used for transplantation with long-term improvement in motor function without immunosuppression (Hallett et al., 2015).",
        "Kikuchi et al. (2017) transplanted neurons derived from iPSCs into NHP brains and found that symptoms improved significantly after two years of tracking the monkeys. Morizane et al. (2017) also transplanted grafted DA neurons induced by cynomolgus iPSCs into allogeneic NHP PD models. Different from Kikuchi et al. (2017), who used FK506 (immune inhibitor) to reduce immune rejection, Morizane et al. (2017) used major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched allogeneic neural cell grafting in the brain, which is considered a less immune-responsive tissue, using iPSCs derived from MHC homozygous cynomolgus macaques. Furthermore, immunohistological analyses revealed that MHC-matching reduced the immune response by suppressing the accumulation of microglia (Iba-1+) and lymphocytes (CD45+) in the grafts (Morizane et al., 2017). These studies have made great contributions to cell transplantation.",
        "Therapeutic stem cell studies have often utilized multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) rather than ESCs, the use of which poses ethical concerns. Bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, and adult adipose-derived stromal tissue have been used as sources of MSCs for autologous grafts (Fallahi et al., 2007; Park et al., 2015).",
        "Using human umbilical MSCs, Wang et al. (2011) showed the potential of this approach for PD treatment. Specifically, human MSCs isolated from Wharton’s jelly of the umbilical cord were induced to transform into DA neurons in vitro through stepwise culturing in neuron-conditioned medium, resulting in a 12.7% success rate, as characterized by positive staining for TH and dopamine released into the culture medium. When these cells were transplanted into the striatum of parkinsonian rats (induced by unilateral striatal lesioning with 6-OHDA), the transplantation partially corrected lesion-induced amphetamine-induced rotation, with the cells showing viability for at least four months. Furthermore, Wang (2011) also found MSCs showed protective effects on progressive DA neural loss in vitro and in vivo. Treatment decreased MG-132-induced DA neuronal loss with a significant reduction in caspase-3 activity. Subsequently, application of hMSCs in MG-132-treated rats dramatically reduced the decline in the number of TH-immunoreactive cells, with an almost 50% increase in the survival of these cells in the substantia nigra (Wang et al., 2011). Furthermore, hMSC treatment significantly decreased OX-6 immunoreactivity and caspase-3 activity (Park et al., 2015). While MSC transplantation may be effective in modulating the immune response in neurodegenerative diseases, it is highly unlikely that MSC-derived neurons will ever be used for cell replacement therapy (Xu et al., 2012). Treatment with MSCs suppresses autoimmunity and restores salivary gland secretory function in both mouse models and Sjogren syndrome patients (Xu et al., 2012). MSC treatment directs T cells toward Treg and Th2, while suppressing Th17 and Tfh responses, and can alleviate disease symptoms (Xu et al., 2012). Collectively, the immunological regulatory functions of MSCs play an important role in Sjogren syndrome pathogenesis, and allogeneic MSC treatment may provide a novel, effective, and safe therapy for patients with this syndrome.",
        "Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent cells capable of differentiating into both neurons and glial cells. By using a monkey model, a group reported that the engrafted newborn neurons could functionally integrate into the host neuronal network, and this had proved that transplantation of NSCs may be a valid way for curing brain injuries (Wang et al., 2017; Wei et al., 2017). There are two ways to obtain human NSCs (hNSCs), i.e., directly from the brain (Abe et al., 2016) and differentiated from other cells, including stem (Kim et al., 2004) and somatic cells (Ai et al., 2016). Bjugstad et al. (2005) transplanted hNSCs into the caudate and substantia nigra of MPTP-induced PD monkeys and concluded that hNSCs may be beneficial for maintaining a normal environment. Their research group also analyzed the differentiation and migration ratio of hNSCs transplanted into the body (Bjugstad et al., 2008; Kern et al., 2011). These studies provide an important basis for the clinical application of hNSCs.",
        "Recent studies have indicated that certain NSCs persist in the adult nervous system and are capable of regenerating new neurons (Bacigaluppi et al., 2016; L'episcopo et al., 2018). Compared with pluripotent stem cells, multipotent NSCs exhibit higher cellular survival rates and lower risk of teratoma formation (Pardal & Barneo, 2012). In addition to the fetal isolation of NSCs, these cells can be obtained from areas of the adult brain, including the subventricular zone, subgranular zone, and hippocampus (Wang et al., 2012). Acquisition of NSCs from non-fetal sources avoids the ethical issues associated with the use of ESCs. Because NSCs can self-renew and differentiate into many types of neurons, including those that are dysfunctional in neurodegenerative diseases, their potential use in the treatment of patients with PD is promising (Choi et al., 2017).",
        "NHPs are similar to humans in size, behavior, physiology, biochemistry, and immune functions (Vierboom et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014). Due to their many advantages, NHP models of PD can compensate for the deficiencies in SCT clinical trials of PD and provide vital information unavailable from rodent models, such as cellular migration, survival, and differentiation after transplantation, choice of target sites, and timelines of recovery (Vermilyea & Emborg, 2018). To date, however, all NHP-based studies on CBT for PD have been performed in neurotoxin-induced PD models. Validating state-of-the-art, recently available genetic models are anticipated to facilitate the development of SCT for PD and its clinical translation.",
        "Different types of stem cells, including ESCs, NSCs, MSCs, and iPSCs, can be used for specific cellular therapeutic approaches. Multiple factors can differentiate these cells into DA neurons, which can be used to replace damaged neurons in PD patients. Methods for inducing differentiation depend upon the type of stem cell. Furthermore, risks such as tumor formation remain after transferring DA cells into PD patients. ESCs and iPSCs have advantages over the other two stem cell types. For example, ESCs remain highly proliferative in vivo and can survive and generate DA neurons after transplantation. In turn, iPSCs can generate unlimited, PD patient-specific cells, and produce a degree of functional host recovery after transplantation (Morizane et al., 2017).",
        "Graft distribution could also benefit from NHP-based studies and noninvasive imaging approaches. For example, Silvestrini et al. (2015) used real-time intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor cell transplantation into a swine and cadaveric human head for possible application in the human brain. Furthermore, Malloy et al. (2017) used an MRI-compatible delivery system to monitor the distribution of cells pre-labeled with a contrast agent into the basal ganglia of a baboon. These new MRI-based imaging methods can increase the safety and accuracy of grafting procedures and facilitate the evaluation of different target sites.",
        "In addition to the challenges mentioned above, many questions remain to be answered in order to improve effective SCT for PD. For example, the influence of cell preparation and storage on engraftment, method of transplantation, choice of target sites, and timelines of recovery are basic parameters that still require evaluation in NHP models to improve SCT for PD and its translation into clinical treatment.",
        "The authors declare that they have no competing interests.",

        "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, age-related and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1–2% of people over 65. As mean population ages and life expectancies increase globally, the incidence of PD is projected to double by 2030. Two classical hallmarks of PD are the degeneration of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic (DA) neurons, and the presence of Lewy bodies in CNS and PNS subregions. Despite decades of research our understanding of the pathophysiology and the diagnosis of PD remains limited, while no disease-modifying therapies presently exist. Current dopamine-replacement strategies and surgical interventions can provide symptomatic relief. However, these symptomatic treatments do not arrest or reverse the underlying pathology, their effectiveness wanes with time, and they typically produce disabling side effects (Poewe et al., 2017). As such, there is an urgent clinical need to better understand and diagnose PD, and to develop novel disease-modifying therapies for PD.",
        "A promising disease-modifying therapy involves the replacement of lost SN DA neurons with stem cell-derived replicas (Stoker et al.; Parmar et al., 2020). Such neurons, particularly when derived from PD patients, can also be used to model and investigate the human pathology, and/or to evaluate novel therapies/drugs in PD. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that epigenetic disturbances and dysregulated microRNA expression occur in PD. Such changes may contribute to the underlying pathophysiology, and could serve as PD biomarkers or even provide novel pharmacological targets (Hegarty et al., 2016; Singh and Sen, 2017; Stoker et al.; van Heesbeen and Smidt). This special issue aimed to publish high-quality articles covering the use of stem cells, epigenetics, and/or microRNA to better understand and diagnose PD, and to ultimately advance research with the potential to produce novel treatments for PD. In this regard, we have gathered six articles which describe the emergence of circulating microRNAs as PD biomarkers, using epigenetics to understand and model PD pathogenesis, and the promise of stem cell-based therapies to treat PD patients.",
        "Chronologically, the first article “Circulating miRNAs as Diagnostic Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease” by Roser et al. discusses the applicability of different body fluids as sources for microRNA biomarkers, highlights technical considerations for microRNA analyses, and then gives an overview of the current evidence on circulating microRNAs as biomarker candidates for PD patients. This mini-review provides a rich resource of information for those aiming to mine the human miRNAome to uncover novel, accessible and reliable diagnostics, or even prognostics, for PD. Indeed, in 2019 Yang et al. published their research article on “Elevated Plasma microRNA-105-5p Level in Patients With Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease: A Potential Disease Biomarker.” In this study, the authors used a combined bioinformatics and biomarker discovery approach to identify and characterize a novel miRNA biomarker of PD. Specifically they used existing miRNA (GSE16658) (Martins et al., 2011) and mRNA expression data (GSE6613) (Scherzer et al., 2007) from PD patients to construct a PD-specific microRNA-mRNA expression network of differentially expressed microRNA-RNA. This approach revealed that miR-105-5p may be a putative biomarker for PD. Yang et al. then experimentally validated that miR-105-5p is elevated in the plasma of idiopathic PD patients, compared to healthy controls and non-PD neurological disorder controls. Moreover, they demonstrated that the miR-105-5p microRNA biomarker was unaffected by L-DOPA, and dopamine receptor agonists, treatments in idiopathic PD patients. Thus, in a clinical setting this microRNA biomarker seems unaffected by a patient's medication status, and can distinguish idiopathic PD from other neurological disorders. Taken together, these two articles demonstrate the utility and promise of circulating microRNAs as PD biomarkers.",
        "Next in 2019, van Heesbeen and Smidt published the review article “Entanglement of Genetics and Epigenetics in Parkinson's Disease,” in which the authors point out important difficulties in untangling the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that may underlie PD progression. Despite this, they describe a number of solid examples which demonstrate independent roles for epigenetic mechanisms, such as age-related epigenetic drift, in PD. In particular, van Heesbeen and Smidt review multiple lines of evidence showing epigenetic (dys)regulation of the SNCA gene, one of the hallmark PD genes. Finally, the authors discuss several mechanisms that may affect local and global epigenetics in PD neurons, including inflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and DNA repair mechanisms, and hypothesize how characterizing the PD epigenome may lead to future therapeutic targets. Complimentary to this review, a mini-review by De Boni and Wüllner entitled “Epigenetic Analysis in Human Neurons: Considerations for Disease Modeling in PD” explores how using humanized disease models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived DA neurons from PD patients, can facilitate the study of epigenetic alterations in PD. They highlight the current advantages and limitations of these models, such as whether the epigenetic (age-associated) landscape of human in vitro neurons compare to the affected neurons in PD patients. In this review, In this review, De Boni and Wüllner demonstrate how human neuronal PD model systems are being used to characterize epigenetic modifications in PD, for example by correlating epigenetic changes to gene expression alterations, and how these insights may inform the development of novel PD therapeutics in the future. Taken together, these two articles comprehensively review the recent progresses toward understanding the contribution of epigenetics to PD pathogenesis.",
        "In 2020, the original research article by Precious et al. entitled “Dopaminergic Progenitors Derived From Epiblast Stem Cells Function Similarly to Primary VM-Derived Progenitors When Transplanted Into a Parkinson's Disease Model” compared stem cell sources for DA transplants. To do this they employed an allograft system where the DA progenitor cells derived from two cell sources, mouse epiblast stem cells, and primary fetal mouse ventral mesencephalon (VM) tissue, were transplanted into the striatum of 6-OHDA lesioned mice pre-treated with L-DOPA, a widely-used PD rodent model. Precious et al. then assessed standard behavioral tests for functional improvements, such as drug-induced rotations, a number of motor tests and drug-induced abnormal involuntary movements. Following these behavioral analyses, the authors reported no significant differences in the functional restoration ability between the gold standard primary VM-derived DA transplants, compared to the pluripotent stem cell-derived DA transplants. This is an important finding for the stem cell neurotransplantation field in PD, as pluripotent stem cell sources have many benefits over primary fetal tissue, such as supply, scalability, consistency, and suitability for good manufacturing practices. Finally, the promise of stem cell-based therapies for PD was comprehensively reviewed in the article “Emerging Treatment Approaches for Parkinson's Disease” by Stoker et al.. In addition to discussing these regenerative cell-based therapies in great detail, this review also explores how gene therapies are being designed to treat the DA aspects of PD, whilst limiting adverse effects, as well as novel approaches to reduce α-synuclein pathology. This mini-review offers an optimistic perspective on the future of PD therapy, by describing how a number of exciting treatments have yielded promising results in pre-clinical and early clinical trials. Indeed, Stoker et al. provided an appropriate conclusion to this special issue when they wrote “it now seems likely that the landscape for the management of PD will change dramatically in the short to medium term future.”",
        "As a whole, this special issue represents the current state-of-the-art in our understanding of the role of stem cells, epigenetics, and microRNAs in PD. We would like to thank all the authors for their valuable participation in this Research Topic, and we hope that it becomes a major reference point and resource for those working in the PD field.",

Key issues are the development of therapies that can stop or reverse the disease progression, identification of dependable biomarkers, and better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of PD. RhoA-ROCK signals appear to have an important role in PD symptoms, making it a possible approach for PD treatment strategies. Activation of RhoA-ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase) appears to stimulate various PD risk factors including aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn), dysregulation of autophagy, and activation of apoptosis. This manuscript reviews current updates about the biology and function of the RhoA-ROCK pathway and discusses the possible role of this signaling pathway in causing the pathogenesis of PD.

        "As the world’s second deadliest health condition, stroke-related healthcare costs - including acute treatment and prolonged recovery processes - create considerable financial pressures on both individuals and healthcare systems (GBD, 2019 Stroke Collaborators, 2021). Approximately 87% of stroke is ischemic stroke and 13% is hemorrhagic stroke (Virani et al., 2020). Current therapeutic options for the acute phase of ischemic stroke include pharmacological thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. However, due to time window limitations, many patients are unable to receive timely treatment, and only 2%–10% of patients worldwide are eligible for these therapies (Mokin et al., 2019; Hacke et al., 2008). Thus, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for ischemic stroke remains imperative.",
        "Although timely reperfusion is essential for the restoration of neurological function, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) impedes the recovery process following ischemic stroke. CIRI leads to cellular excitotoxicity, Ca2+ overload, autophagy, and aberrant immune responses and so on (Zhou et al., 2018; Campbell et al., 2019). At the same time, CIRI also causes morphological changes in neurons, such as dendritic and axonal retraction and loss of synapses and dendritic spines (Brown and Murphy, 2008). A series of damages to brain can lead to patients experiencing impaired or even loss of normal function. Therefore, how to treat CIRI has been a hot spot in research. Currently, the drugs used to treat CIRI mainly include anti-free radical damage drugs (Takase et al., 2018), anti-inflammatory drugs (Xu et al., 2018), Ca2+ antagonists (Carlson et al., 2020), excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists (Margaill et al., 1996), and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (Fan et al., 2020).",
        "TCM, renowned for its multi-component and multi-target approaches with minimal side effects, has been utilized for centuries in China and other countries to treat ischemic stroke, with Chuanxiong—a widely used and ancient medicinal herb from Sichuan—first documented in the “Shen Nong’s Canon of Materia Medica (Chen et al., 2018). Chuanxiong has been used to protect against ischemic injury, enhance immunity, and treat menstrual cramps and diabetes (Wang J. et al., 2022). In clinical treatment, Chuanxiong has also been made into a variety of Chinese medicines, including ligustrazine injection, Xuefu Zhuyu Granules and Chuanxiong Chatiao San, etc (Shao et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019). Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), one of the components of Chuanxiong, effectively penetrates blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Tsai and Liang, 2001), thereby being widely utilized in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) exerts neuroprotective effects by inhibiting calcium-ion overload (Yu et al., 2019), inhibition of inflammatory response (Shah et al., 2019), promotion of BBB repair (Gong et al., 2019), enhancement of synaptic plasticity (Lin et al., 2021), and inducing recovery of neurovascular units (Feng et al., 2023). Cellular experiments have demonstrated that TMP reduces neuronal death induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) (Shao et al., 2017), and its efficacy has been validated in clinical trials (Ni et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2012).",
        "Ischemic-hypoxic injury in the CNS activates the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, where ROCK, as the primary downstream effector of RhoA, is critical in cytoskeletal regulation (Lang et al., 1996; Matsui et al., 1996; Nakagawa et al., 1996; Wang Q. et al., 2022). ROCK participates in multiple processes such as cytoskeletal regulation and cell survival by phosphorylating LIM kinase (LIMK) (Mulherkar and Tolias, 2020), which subsequently phosphorylates cofilin, thereby modulating F-actin homeostasis and inducing cytoskeletal remodeling that leads to dendritic contraction and the loss of dendritic spines (Jahani et al., 2018; Allen et al., 2010). TMP can inhibit the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway and alleviate damage to brain microvascular endothelial cells (Yang et al., 2017). Leveraging mRNA sequencing analysis, this study further explores the neuroprotective effects of TMP in CIRI, thereby providing theoretical foundation for the application of TMP.",
        "We utilized Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 64) sourced from an AAALAC-accredited supplier (Hubei Bainter Laboratory Animal Technology Co., China). Ethical oversight was maintained through formal review (Approval ID: WP20230166) by Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University. After acclimatizing the rats for 3 days, they were divided into the sham, model, and TMP groups. To allow the drug concentration to build up, the rats in TMP group were injected with TMP (40 mg/kg) for 3 days before the surgery. The specific experimental steps were: after anesthetizing the rats with 3% pentobarbital sodium, the skin was prepared and sterilized. A 1.5–2 cm notch was cut in the neck of the rats. After separating the muscle, the common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed. The proximal CCA and external carotid artery (ECA) were ligated separately. A thin thread was left in the CCA to facilitate subsequent fixation of filament. Transient focal ischemia was induced via intraluminal filament technique. After temporary occlusion of the CCA with a 40 g vascular clamp, a 4–0 nylon suture (diameter 0.23 ± 0.02 mm) coated with poly-L-lysine was introduced through a micro-incision (0.4 mm) and navigated 20.5 ± 0.3 mm into the internal carotid artery to achieve MCAO. For sham group, no filament was inserted. 90 min later, the filament was removed. The Longa scale was performed by an uninformed researcher (Longa et al., 1989). Subjects meeting predefined inclusion criteria (neurological deficit scores 1–3 on the 5-point Garcia scale) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal assessment, while those scoring at scale extremes (0 = no deficit; 4 = maximal impairment) were systematically eliminated to ensure cohort homogeneity. The experimental steps are shown in Figure 1.",
        "Experimental protocol, and TMP. (A) TMP was injected intraperitoneally 3 days before MCAO/R surgery and 14 days after it. Behavioral test was conducted at postoperative days (POD) 3, 7, and 14. The Morris water maze (MWM) was tested from POD14 to POD19. Tissue analysis and mRNA sequencing were performed on day 20. (B) Chemical structural formula of TMP.",
        "Behavioral changes in different groups were assessed using the mNSS and the MWM test (n = 10). The mNSS was performed on postoperative days 3, 7, and 14. The mNSS, totaling 18 points, was assessed from sensory, motor, balance, and reflexes (Bieber et al., 2019).",
        "The MWM was performed on postoperative days 14–19. The water was dyed black with ink to track the rat’s movement. An animal video tracking was used to record the rats’ swimming trajectories, speeds, arrival times at the platform, and the number of times they traversed the platform. MWM test was divided into a 5-day spatial learning period and a platform-free exploration period on the last day. During the spatial learning period, the platform was placed in one quadrant. The rats were placed in the water from four positions. If the rats did not find the platform within 60 s, the rats were instructed to stand on the platform to ensure that all rats had the same time for spatial observation and learning. On the sixth day, the platform was removed and the rats were placed in the water for 60 s to end the experiment.",
        "Following induction of deep anesthesia using sodium pentobarbital (n = 5), cardiac perfusion was performed transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Excised cerebral tissues underwent 24-hour post-fixation in the same fixative at 4°C before being processed for paraffin embedding. Using a rotary microtome, consecutive 5 μm coronal sections were obtained and mounted on adhesive-coated slides. After standard dewaxing and rehydration procedures, adjacent sections were alternately processed for HE and Nissl staining to assess cytoarchitectural integrity. A systematic random sampling approach was implemented for microscopic analysis, with four non-overlapping fields (400 × magnification) examined in peri-lesional regions per animal across three anatomically matched sections. Brightfield imaging was conducted utilizing a BX53 light microscope (Olympus) equipped with a DP74 digital camera system. To maintain objectivity, experimental groups were coded prior to analysis, and quantitative assessments were performed by two independent investigators unaware of treatment conditions.",
        "Following standard paraffin section preparation as previously described, apoptotic cells were identified using TUNEL assay system. Nuclear visualization was achieved through DAPI fluorescent labeling. For quantitative analysis, a systematic random sampling strategy was employed, wherein four non-overlapping microscopic fields (400 × magnification) within peri-infarct regions were captured per animal using a BX53 fluorescence microscope (Olympus) equipped with appropriate filter sets for DAPI (excitation/emission: 358/461 nm) and TUNEL detection. Three anatomically matched coronal sections were analyzed for each experimental subject. To ensure unbiased data collection, all image acquisition and analysis procedures were conducted by investigators blinded to experimental conditions, with sample identification codes maintained by an independent researcher until completion of quantitative assessments.",
        "To detect the impact of TMP on the cerebral gene expression, we took the tissues of the ischemic penumbra from rats in the sham, model and TMP groups (n = 3) respectively. After RNA extraction using the Trizol method, the concentration and integrity of the RNA were assessed. Library preparation was performed using the Library Prep Kit (BGI-Shenzhen, China). The library was amplified to obtain DNA nanoballs (DNBs). The sequencing data underwent filtering and quality control with SOAPnuke (v2.2.1) (Li et al., 2008), ensuring only high-quality reads were retained for further analysis. For alignment against the reference genome, we employed HISAT2 to accurately map the cleaned reads (Kim et al., 2015). To assess gene expression, clean reads were aligned to a database of reference coding genes utilizing Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Gene expression quantification was then conducted using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). Ultimately, to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), an analysis was carried out with DESeq2 (v1.34.0), applying a threshold of a q-value below 0.05 for stringent statistical significance (Love et al., 2014). To gain deeper insights into the functions and pathways of DEGs regulated by TMP in CIRI, we employed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis.",
        "Following deep anesthesia induction with sodium pentobarbital (n = 3 Sprague-Dawley rats), cerebral tissues from peri-infarct regions were harvested after transcardial perfusion with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Tissue specimens (50 mg) were processed through mechanical homogenization using RIPA extraction buffer. Protein quantification was subsequently performed via BCA protein assay kit prior to SDS-PAGE separation. Based on the predicted molecular weights of target proteins, protein extracts were resolved on discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Epizyme Biomedical, Shanghai, China) under reducing conditions. Electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Bands were blocked for 1 h. Subsequently, the strips were incubated with primary antibodies: anti-RhoA protein (RhoA; 1:1,000; Proteintech), anti-ROCK2 protein (ROCK2; 1:1,000; Abmart), anti-phosphorylated LIMK1 protein (Phospho-LIMK1; 1:1,000; Abmart), anti-phosphorylated Cofilin protein (Phospho-Cofilin; 1:1,000; Abmart), anti-PSD95 protein (PSD95; 1:2000; Proteintech), anti-MAP2 protein (MAP2; 1:2000; Affinity), and anti-β actin protein (β actin; 1:4,000.

        "Paraffin sections were prepared as above. After antigen repair with EDTA antigen repair solution, the sections were blocked with blocking buffer (n = 5). Specific primary antibodies were added overnight. After washing the sections, specific secondary antibody was added in the dark. In the end, sections were stained with DAPI. The primary antibodies were: anti-RhoA protein (RhoA; 1:800; Proteintech), anti-ROCK2 protein (ROCK2; 1:200; Abmart), anti-phosphorylated LIMK protein (Phospho-LIMK1; 1:500; Abmart), anti-phosphorylated Cofilin protein (Phospho-Cofilin; 1:500; Abmart), anti-PSD95 protein (PSD95; 1:800; Proteintech), and anti-MAP2 protein (MAP2; 1:200; Affinity).For quantitative histological analysis, a systematic random sampling approach was implemented in peri-infarct cortical regions. Four non-overlapping microscopic fields (400 × magnification) were captured per animal using an Olympus BX53 imaging system equipped with a DP74 digital camera (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Three anatomically matched coronal sections, spaced at 200 μm intervals to ensure independent sampling, were analyzed for each experimental subject.

        "Following deep anesthesia induction via intraperitoneal administration of sodium pentobarbital (n = 5), cubic tissue blocks (1 mm3) from peri-infarct cortical regions were dissected and immersion-fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde. Following fixation with 1% osmium tetroxide, tissue specimens underwent sequential ethanol dehydration and subsequent embedding in Epon 812 epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were obtained using a diamond knife-equipped ultramicrotome, followed by dual staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for electron density enhancement. Ultrastructural examination was performed using a Hitachi HT7800 TEM. A systematic random sampling protocol was implemented, wherein four non-overlapping fields (15,000 × magnification) within the ischemic penumbra were captured per animal across three anatomically matched tissue planes spaced at 200 µm intervals.

The blood on the surface of the tissues was quickly rinsed off with double-distilled water (ddH2O), and the tissues were subsequently cut into 100 μm thin slices. The sections were dehydrated and sealed with a resin sealer after completing the subsequent staining. Dendritic length and dendritic spine density were analyzed separately using Sholl analysis in ImageJ software.",
        "The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0. mNSS and the escape latency data were tested using two-way ANOVA, and the rest of the data were tested using one-way ANOVA. Statistical significance was established at P values below the 0.05 threshold.",
        "To evaluate the impact of TMP on behavioral changes, we implemented the mNSS and MWM tests. After performing the mNSS on days 3, 7, and 14, we found that the rats in the sham group had mNSS of 0, indicating no neurological deficits. On days 7 and 14, the mNSS scores of rats in the TMP group were significantly lower than those in the model group (Figure 2A; P < 0.01). It suggests although TMP could not completely eliminate the neurological impairments, it was effective in improving the neurological functions over time.",

        "From days 14 to day 19, we conducted MWM tests. The results showed no significant difference in swimming speed between different groups, which eliminated any potential bias caused by differences in motor ability (Figure 2B). The escape latency time gradually decreased in all groups as training progressed. Starting from the second day, the TMP group showed a shorter escape latency time than model group (Figure 2D; P < 0.01), and this difference became more significant as time went on (Figure 2D; P < 0.001). After completing the 5-day learning period, we conducted the spatial exploration test to measure the time rats spent in the correct quadrant, the number of times they crossed the platform. The TMP group crossed the platform significantly more times than the model group (Figure 2E; P < 0.001), and they also spent significantly more time in the correct quadrant than model group (Figure 2F; P < 0.001).",
        "To evaluate the impact of TMP on neurons in peri-infarct area, we performed HE, Nissl and TUNEL staining to assess neuronal damage. The results of HE staining showed the peri-infarct tissues in the sham group were structurally intact, uniformly arranged and clearly outlined, with bluish-purple nuclei and light red cytoplasm. In the model group, the cells exhibited obvious defects and disordered arrangement. Some cells were swollen, and the nuclei were solidified in the model group. Although necrotic cells were still present in the TMP group, the overall number of surviving cells were more, and edema was reduced (Figure 3A).",

Whereas the model and TMP groups had shallow staining, nuclear consolidation or fragmentation, and some Nissl bodies disappeared (Figure 3B). Further counting of surviving neurons revealed that there were significantly more surviving neurons in the TMP group than in the model group (Figure 3D; P < 0.001).",
        "TUNEL staining specifically shows broken DNA, therefore it is used to detect cell death. Red color after staining indicates positive cells, and blue color indicates nuclei. There are no positive cells were observed in the sham group, and positive cells were seen in both the model and TMP groups (Figure 3C). Statistical analysis showed that the number of positive cells in the TMP group was significantly less than that in the model group (Figure 3E; P < 0.001). These results suggested that TMP promoted the repair of neurons.",
        "After TMP intervention, we extracted RNA from the peri-infarct area from sham, model and TMP groups for mRNA sequencing. We filtered the top 100 DEGs by P-value from smallest to largest (Figure 4A) and found that RhoA and ROCK2 were up-regulated in the model group compared to the sham group, but TMP intervention resulted in significant down-regulation of RhoA and ROCK. This indicates that RhoA and ROCK2 may be the pathogenic genes of CIRI and the target genes of TMP intervention. Additionally, we found 391 DEGs between model and TMP groups, including 172 upregulated genes and 219 downregulated genes (Figure 4B).",

Based on the results of the GO functional enrichment analysis, it is evident that most of the results are related to neuroplasticity.

        "The incidence of stroke continues to rise annually, impacting up to one in five individuals in some high-income countries and nearly half of the population in low-income countries (Hilkens et al., 2024). t-PA remains the only therapeutic agent for acute ischemic stroke. However, its efficacy is limited by a narrow therapeutic window, underscoring the urgent need for more effective treatments with fewer side effects (Fonarow et al., 2014). Therapeutic interventions during the subacute phase not only promotes functional recovery, but also reduces the risk of stroke recurrence. Implementing effective secondary prevention strategies in patients experiencing a first stroke or transient ischemic attack could potentially reduce the overall stroke burden by up to 25% (Hankey, 2014).",
        "Natural products, especially active compounds derived from TCM, have demonstrated therapeutic effects in various diseases (Zhu et al., 2022). TMP, as a herbal extract, has been utilized for over two millennia in treating numerous ailments. TMP has shown efficacy in managing conditions such as stroke (Chen and Chen, 1992), coronary heart disease (Zhang et al., 2016), diabetes mellitus (Yang et al., 2011), cancer (Chen et al., 2013), and kidney injury (Gong et al., 2013). TMP can effectively cross BBB, making it a valuable agent in treating CNS disorders. Clinically, TMP has been employed in the management of CIRI for nearly 5 decades. In the past 2 decades, research on TMP’s effects on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) has gained significant attention. Ding et al. demonstrated that TMP could reduce oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neuronal death (Ding et al., 2019). Similarly, Gong et al. found that TMP enhances neural function recovery post-CIRI by restoring BBB integrity and function of the BBB (Gong et al., 2019). Our study corroborates these findings, showing that TMP promotes neurological function recovery as well as neuronal repair following CIRI in rats.",
        "To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TMP’s ameliorative effects on CIRI, we conducted mRNA sequencing on the peri-infarct tissues. DEGs analysis revealed significant upregulation of RhoA, ROCK2 and downstream genes such as LIMK1 and Cofilin1 in the model group compared to the sham group. TMP intervention markedly downregulated these genes. Heatmap and volcano plot analyses indicated distinct clustering patterns of RhoA/ROCK pathway-related genes between the model and TMP-treated groups. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis highlighted the significant association of RhoA and ROCK with neuroplasticity. Additionally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) linked the RhoA/ROCK pathway to various biological processes. Specifically, RhoA influences cytoskeletal remodeling and postsynaptic membrane stability through ROCK activation, which subsequently phosphorylates and regulates downstream effectors like LIMK and Cofilin. Under pharmacological stimulation (e.g., cocaine and amphetamine), RhoA/ROCK signaling impacts synaptic connection formation, synaptic transmission efficiency, and neuronal excitability (Lepack et al., 2020; Ferreira et al., 2024). Moreover, it modulates calcium signaling’s regulatory effects on synaptic plasticity by adjusting the coupling efficiency of calcium ion transport proteins with the actin cytoskeleton (Zonouzi et al., 2011). KEGG pathway analysis further indicated a significant association between TMP intervention and the Ras signaling pathway. GSEA results also connected the RhoA/ROCK pathway with multiple other pathways. RhoA activation of ROCK1/2 inhibits cofilin’s depolymerization activity via LIMK phosphorylation, affecting actin stability. This regulation is crucial in cocaine addiction-related signaling and may influence synaptic transmission and dendritic spine morphology remodeling through CREB and dopamine receptor pathways (Tropea et al., 2022; Tropea et al., 2024). Additionally, sphingolipid and ether lipid metabolism play vital roles in cell membrane structure and signaling, interacting with RhoA/ROCK-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling (Incontro et al., 2025). The upregulation of steroid hormone and retinol metabolism may further activate the RhoA pathway, synergizing with neuronal synaptic adaptations (Lee et al., 2024; Carazo et al., 2021). Notably, the downregulation of the phagosome pathway suggests reduced immune stress following TMP intervention, aiding in maintaining neuronal function homeostasis and enhancing plasticity (Martinelli et al., 2021). Combined with the results of differential gene screening, GO analysis, and KEGG analysis, we proposed that RhoA and ROCK2 may be the pathogenic genes of CIRI, and TMP may promote nerve regeneration in CIRI rats through the RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway.",
        "RhoA/ROCK pathway is implicated in various diseases, including ovarian cancer (Wei et al., 2021), chronic headache (Jing et al., 2019), traumatic brain injury (Mulherkar and Tolias, 2020), Parkinson’s disease (Iyer et al., 2021), stroke (Lu et al., 2023)and other neurological disorders. Numerous studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway promotes neuroregeneration. For instance, Ding et al. demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide facilitates the phenotypic conversion of astrocytes to the A2 phenotype post-CIRI by inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, thereby enhancing neurological recovery (Ding et al., 2024). Similarly, Yuan et al. reported that Xueshuantong injection promotes neuroregeneration by activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and inhibiting RhoA/ROCK pathway, thereby enhancing synaptic plasticity after focal CIRI in rats (Yuan et al., 2022).",
        "To further investigate TMP’s neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects via the inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK pathway, we employed lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as an agonist to activate this pathway (Sawada et al., 2002). Western blot and immunofluorescence staining analyses revealed that TMP downregulated the expression of RhoA, ROCK, P-LIMK, and P-Cofilin. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining analyses revealed that TMP downregulated the expression of RhoA, ROCK, phosphorylated LIMK (P-LIMK), and phosphorylated Cofilin (P-Cofilin) (Yang et al., 2017). Conversely, the addition of LPA attenuated TMP’s inhibitory effect on the RhoA/ROCK pathway, consistent with other studies (Li et al., 2022). Conversely, the addition of LPA attenuated TMP’s inhibitory effect on the RhoA/ROCK pathway, consistent with other studies (Levy et al., 2015), and MAP2, a dendritic plasticity-related protein sensitive to ischemia, were both upregulated by TMP treatment (Li et al., 1998). This upregulation was accompanied by enhanced synaptic and dendritic morphology regeneration. However, these effects were diminished upon LPA addition. The findings cumulatively indicate that TMP exerts its neuroprotective effects against CIRI primarily through modulation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling cascade. While our data support the involvement of the RhoA/ROCK2 pathway in TMP’s neuroprotection, whether TMP directly binds to RhoA/ROCK or their upstream regulators (e.g., GEFs like p115‐RhoGEF or LARG) remains unclear. Future studies employing biophysical assays (e.g., SPR) and genetic manipulation (e.g., GEF‐knockout models) are needed to identify the direct target. Additionally, the crosstalk between TMP and parallel pathways (e.g., MAPK/NF‐κB) warrants investigation to fully elucidate its mechanism.",
        "Our findings indicate that TMP exerts neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects in CIRI by inhibiting the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. By downregulating key components of this pathway, TMP promotes synaptic and dendritic plasticity, thereby facilitating neurological recovery. These insights not only enhance our understanding of TMP’s therapeutic mechanisms but also highlight the RhoA/ROCK pathway as a promising target for developing novel treatments for CIRI and related neurological disorders.",
