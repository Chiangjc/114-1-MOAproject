        "A protective effect of vegan diets on health outcomes has been observed in previous studies, but its impact on diabetes is still debated. The aim of this review is to assess the relationship between vegan diets and the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) along with its effect on glycemic control and diabetes-related complications.

        "Interest in vegan diets is increasing around the world: it is estimated that the number of vegans in the US grew by 600% from nearly 4 million in 2014 to 19.6 million in 2017 [1]. Ideological, environmental, ethical, political or religious arguments are the most important reasons for this rapid growth.",
        "An association between a vegan diet and a reduced risk of total cancer incidence has been demonstrated in large prospective cohort studies [2], but its impact in diabetes mellitus (DM) is still under debate. As diet and lifestyle are the fundamental pillars of DM prevention and therapy and plant-based diets (PBD) are considered an example of healthful eating patterns and are recommended for individuals with DM [3], we may also expect some beneficial effects in the case of the vegan diet.",
        "The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of all observational and intervention studies that describe the relationship between vegan diets and the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D), along with its effect on glycemic control and T2D-related complications.",
        "Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta–Analyses) statement [4] we systematically conducted electronic searches in Pubmed and Cochrane library databases including all studies published in English language until 23 May 2020. Additional manual searches using the reference lists of identified articles, reviews and meta–analyses were also performed. The search strategy included the following keywords used in all fields or in combination as MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms: “veganism”/”vegan diet”/”vegans”/”vegan dietary pattern”/”plant–based diet”/”plant–based dietary pattern” and “diabetes”/”diabetes mellitus”/”type 2 diabetes”/”type 2 diabetes mellitus”.",
        "We considered all observational (i.e., cross–sectional or prospective cohort studies) and randomized controlled studies based on the PICO framework (P—population: presumably healthy adults in case of observational studies or individuals with T2D ≥ 18 years in case of randomized controlled studies; I—intervention: vegan or plant–based diet, defined as a dietary pattern that omit all the animal–derived products; C—comparisons: omnivorous diet, defined as a consumption of all types of foods, including meat, meat products and poultry; O—outcomes: prevalence or incidence of T2D in case of observational studies, glycemic control—fasting glucose and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and risk factors for diabetes related complications—Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, microalbuminuria or other parameters of renal function, electrochemical skin conductance or other parameters of nerve function in case of randomized controlled studies. Studies were excluded if there was no vegan intervention (e.g., flexitarian, pesco-vegetarian, lacto-ovo-vegetarian); intervention < 4 week; no omnivorous control; were not conducted in humans or in individuals with T2D (e.g., prediabetes or type 1 diabetes); were conducted in children, adolescents, pregnant or breastfeeding women. When multiple articles for a single study were present, we considered the most recent publication, eventually completed with data from the previous reports. Three investigators (Daniela Pollakova, Davide Lauro and Claudio Tubili) independently reviewed and extracted relevant data. All discrepancies were resolved by consensus.",
        "The included studies were independently assessed by three reviewers (Daniela Pollakova, Davide Lauro and Claudio Tubili) for methodological quality using elements of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies [5] and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool [6] in the case of randomized controlled studies. In the NIH, possible sources of bias (e.g., selection, information, performance, attrition, measurement/detection), confounding, reporting and other factors were assessed through 14 items. Studies were rated as good (low risk of bias), fair (study susceptible to some bias) and poor (significant risk of bias) quality. In randomized controlled studies, an assessment of the risk of bias was carried out across 5 domains (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting). Studies were identified as being of low risk if proper methods were taken to reduce bias (1 point), of high risk if improper methods creating bias were taken (0 point) or of unclear risk if insufficient information was provided to determine the bias level (0.5 point). A total possible score of 5 points could be obtained; studies scoring 5.0–4.5 were considered as being of low risk, 4.0–3.5 points as of moderate risk and <3.5 points as of high risk of bias. All disagreements were discussed and resolved.",
        "The initial search identified 898 results (Pubmed = 824, Cochrane Library = 66, other sources = 8) and after the application of inclusion/exclusion criteria, a final sample of 15 articles (7 observational and 8 randomized controlled studies) were included for this review (Figure 1).",
        "The main characteristics of the included observational studies reporting the effects of vegan or plant-based dietary patterns on risk for T2D (prevalence or incidence) are summarized in Table 1. Of the seven studies, five were classified as prospective cohort studies [7,8,9,10,11] and two as cross-sectional studies [12,13]. The study quality assessment for each observational study reported a good quality in four studies [9,10,11,13] and a fair quality in three studies [7,8,12]. No study was rated of poor quality.",
        "Out of the seven observational studies, two cross-sectional studies reported the prevalence of T2D among vegans [12,13]. In the Adventist Health study-2 [12] that included more than 60,000 subjects (22,434 men and 38,469 women) from US and Canada and aged 30 years or older, the prevalence of T2D was higher among nonvegetarians (7,6%) than in the various types of vegetarianism (semi-vegetarians 6,1%; pesco-vegetarians 4,8%; lacto-ovo-vegetarians 3,2%; vegans 2,9%) and among these, the lowest prevalence of T2D was seen in vegans (2,6x lower than in omnivores). It is worth noting that the difference in the mean BMI between vegans and omnivores was more than 5 units (23.6 kg/m2 vs. 28.8 kg/m2, respectively), but also after adjustment for BMI and others variables (age, sex, ethnicity, education, income, physical activity, television watching, sleep habits, alcohol use), vegans had a lower risk of T2D than nonvegetarians (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.40–0.66). Different results were observed in India’s third National Family Health Survey [13]. In this cross-sectional study of 156,317 participants (56,742 men and 99,574 women) aged 20–49 years, no significantly different prevalence of T2D between vegans (n = 2560) and omnivores (n = 99,372) was observed (1.0% vs. 1.2%, respectively) and the difference between the mean BMI was also low (20.5 kg/m2 in vegans vs. 20.7 kg/m2 in omnivores).",
        "From the seven observational studies, five prospective cohort studies evaluated the incidence rate of T2D among vegans [7,11] or people that consumed a PBD [8,9,10].",
        "In the population of the Adventist Health Study-2 [7] that included more than 40,000 participants (15,200 men and 26,187 women) free of DM at baseline, cases of T2D developed in 0.54% of vegans (n = 3545), respective to 2.12% of omnivores (n = 17,695) after 2 years. The vegan diet was resulted as protective for the development of T2D, respective to non-vegetarians in both non-Black (White non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Asian, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander or American Indian) and Black (African American, West Indian/Caribbean, African or other Black) participants (OR 0.429, 95% CI 0.249–0.740 and OR 0.381, 95% CI 0.236–0.617, respectively) after adjustment for age, sex, education, income, television watching, physical activity, sleep, alcohol use, smoking and BMI.",
        "Slightly different results were observed in the EPIC–Oxford cohort study of 45,314 UK adults (10,737 men and 34,577 women) aged 20–90 years. Over a mean follow-up of 17.6 years, the percentage of incident T2D cases among 1781 vegans was lower than in 22,796 omnivores (1.45% vs. 3.83%, respectively), and after adjustment for age, education, socio-economic status, physical activity, ethnicity, smoke and alcohol intake, the hazard ratio for developing T2D in vegans was significantly lower than in regular meat eaters (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36–0.79). However, when the analysis was further adjusted for BMI, the significance was lost (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.66–1.48). It is important to notice that authors have evaluated regular meat eaters (defined as subjects who consumed ≥ 50 g of meat per day) and low meat eaters (consumption of <50 g of meat per day) separately, using regular meat eaters as a reference group but not a whole sample of omnivores.",
        "In the ATTICA Cohort Study [9], the dietary habits of 1485 Greek adults (726 men and 759 women) aged 18–89 years and free of DM and any cardiovascular disease at baseline were evaluated. After 10 years of follow up, a crude T2D incidence rate of 12.9% was observed. Using the a posteriori method for assessing the most healthful dietary pattern and after stratification by age-group, as well as after adjustment for sex, family history of DM, waist circumference and smoking status, it was observed that the consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, bread, rusk and pasta (all food groups “allowed” to be consumed by vegans) reduced the 10-year T2D risk by 40%, but only in the 45–55 years age group at baseline with marginal statistical significance (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.34–1.07). When the analysis was additionally adjusted for the percentage of calories from carbohydrates and for total energy intake, statistical significance was lost completely (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34–1.13 and OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.35–1.49, respectively), indicating a partially mediating effect of carbohydrates and the importance of the total amount of assumed calories. Not all studies dichotomously classified dietary patterns as vegan or plant-based and omnivorous. Several studies investigated the variation in the degree of having a plant-based versus animal-based diet.",
        "The impact of PBD, and its healthy and unhealthy version, on T2D incidence was studied on the sample of more than 200,000 participants (40,539 men and 160,188 women) aged 25–75 years, recruited in three US cohort studies: Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study 2 and Health Professionals Follow-up Study [8]. All participants were free of any chronic disease at baseline and were followed for more than 20 years. In these studies, there was 16,162 incident cases of T2D in 4,102,369 person–years of follow-up. Authors created an overall “Plant-based Diet Index” (PDI)—the more plant foods were consumed, a higher score was obtained, while the consumption of animal foods lowered the score. The PDI was then divided in deciles. After adjustment for BMI, age, smoking status, physical activity, alcohol intake, multivitamin use, family history of DM, margarine and energy intake, baseline hypertension and baseline hypercholesterolemia, it was observed that subjects with the highest decile of PDI compared to those in the lowest one had a reduction of about 20% in the risk of T2D (HR for extreme deciles 0.80, 95% CI 0.74–0.87). Then, healthful and unhealthful versions of PDI were created (hPDI and uPDI, respectively) with the same modalities; for instance, vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains or vegetable oils were considered healthy PDI; on the other hand, refined grains, fruit juices, sweetened beverages, potatoes, desserts, etc. were calculated as unhealthy PDI. Evaluating the difference between the highest and the lowest decile of hPDI, there was a further 34% reduction in T2D disease (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.61–0.72). On the contrary, the difference in uPDI resulted in the increased risk of about 16% (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08–1.25).",
        "Additionally, in the Rotterdam Study (RS) [10], a prospective population-based cohort study, the continuous PDI was constructed (range 0–92) in a population of 6798 participants (2808 men and 3990 women), with an age of 62.7 ± 7.8 years. Food-frequency questionnaires at baseline of three RS groups (RS-I-1: 1989–1993, RS-II-1: 2000–2001, RSIII-1: 2006–2008) were collected. After a median follow-up of 7.3 years and withdrawal of 28 subjects, during 54,024 person–years of follow-up, amongst 6670 subjects, 642 incident cases of T2D were documented. After adjustment for energy intake, sex, age, RS sub-cohort, smoking status, educational level, physical activity, dietary supplement use and family history of DM, a higher score on the PDI was associated with a lower diabetes incidence (per 10 units higher score on index HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73–0.92) and also after adjustment for BMI, the significance was maintained (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79–0.99).",
        "Eight randomized controlled studies evaluating the impact of vegan or PBD on glycemic control and diabetes-related complications in T2D patients met all inclusion criteria. The main characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 2. The risk of bias assessment for each study reported a high risk of bias in three studies [14,15,16] and a moderate risk in five [17,18,19,20,21] studies. No study was rated to have a low risk of bias, mainly due to impossible double-blinding in dietary intervention trials.",
        "All included studies reported a reduction between −0.3% [17] to −1.4 % [14] of HbA1c levels after vegan diet, and in five studies, this reduction reached statistical significance [15,18,19,20,21]. On the other hand, in control groups, six studies reported a reduction in HbA1c levels [14,15,16,17,20,21] (three reached the statistical significance [15,20,21]) that varied from −0.14% [16] to −1.0% [14]. Bunner et al. [19] reported no change from baseline and Mishra et al. [18] described the increase by 0.1% and only in two studies [18,20], the mean between-group difference of changes from baseline to final values was significant (Table 3).",
        "Not all studies reported the effect of the vegan diet on fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Out of six studies evaluating this variable [14,15,16,19,20,21], only Nicholson et al. [14] reported a significant difference between groups assessing the intervention mean created by averaging the six biweekly measures with a reduction of 28% from baseline to the intervention mean in the vegan group, compared to a 12% decrease in the control group. Barnard et al. [16] reported a significant decline only in the intervention group. In other studies, the reduction, although not significant, was observed in both the intervention and the control groups, except for the study of Lee et al. [20] where the values of fasting plasma glucose remained unchanged in the control group (Supplementary Table S1).",
        "Five studies reported the BMI measurement as an outcome [16,18,19,20,21] and all of them noticed its significant reduction after the vegan diet that varied from −0.4 kg/m2 [20] to −2.4 kg/m2 [19]. On the other hand, in control groups, four studies reported a reduction in BMI [16,19,20,21] (two of them [16,21] reached significance) that varied from −0.1 kg/m2 [20] to −1.5 kg/m2 [21] and Mishra et al. [18] reported no change from baseline. Only in two studies [18,19] was the mean between-group difference of changes from baseline to final values significant.",
        "As regards the waist circumference, three studies evaluated this outcome [16,17,20], and all of them reported its significant reduction in the intervention group that varied from −3.1 cm [20] to −4.7 cm [17]. In the control groups, Barnard et al. [16] reported a significant reduction by −1.8 cm, Lee et al. [20] a not significant reduction by −0.8 cm and Ferdowsian et al. [17] described a not significant increase by 0.8 cm. Two studies [17,20] reported a significant mean between-group difference.",
        "All studies reported the evaluation of systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure. In the intervention groups, the changes in SBP varied from −11.5 mmHg [19] to +1.0 mmHg [20], but only in the study of Mishra et al. [18] did this change reach significance. Generally, five studies reported the reduction [14,15,18,19,21], two studies reported no variation [16,17] and only Lee et al. [20] reported the increase in SBP. In the control groups, six studies [14,15,18,19,20,21] reported the reduction and two studies [16,17] the increase in SBP from baseline to final analysis that varied from −18.9 mmHg [14] to +5.7 mmHg [17], but only in two studies [17,18] did this difference reach statistical significance and Ferdowsian et al. [17] alone reported a significant mean between-group difference. As for the DBP, in the intervention groups, only Lee et al. [20] reported a not significant increase in DBP by +1.1 mmHg. In the other studies, its reduction was described, that varied from −5.8 mmHg [14] to −0.4 mmHg [17], and in four studies [15,16,18,19] these changes were significant. In the control groups, only Ferdowsian et al. [17] reported a significant increase in DBP by +5.1 mmHg; in the other studies, the described DBP variation was between −10.6 mmHg [14] to −1.4 mmHg [20] and three of them were significant [15,16,18]. Again, only Ferdowsian et al. [17] reported a significant mean between-group difference in DBP values.",
        "All studies except Lee et al. [20] reported changes in total cholesterol, and all of them noticed its reduction after both the intervention and the control diet, omitting the control group in the study of Bunner et al. [19] (increase by 2.2 mg/dL), and this reduction varied from −24.32 mg/dL [14] to −9.8 mg/dL [17] after the vegan diet (four reached statistical significance [15,16,17,18]) and from −24.32 mg/dL [14] to −1.3 mg/dL [18] in the control groups (three were significant [15,16,21]). Only Mishra et al. [18] noticed a significant in-between group difference of changes from baseline to final values.",
        "All studies reported the evaluation of HDL cholesterol. In the intervention groups, the changes from baseline to final values varied from −7.72 mg/dL [14] to + 2.2 mg/dL [20] and in five studies, these changes reached the significance [14,17,18,19,21]. Generally, six studies reported the reduction [14,16,17,18,19,21] and two studies [15,20] reported the increase in HDL cholesterol. Additionally, in the control groups, six studies [14,15,16,17,19,21] described its reduction (from −2.4 mg/dL [19] to −0.4 mg/dL [17]), in two studies [18,20] HDL cholesterol increased (by + 0.5 mg/dL [20] and + 0.7 mg/dL [18]) and none of these changes were statistically significant. Regarding the mean in-between group difference, only in the studies of Ferdowsian et al. [17] and Mishra et al. [18] did HDL cholesterol values reach statistical significance.",
        "On the other hand, not all studies evaluated changes in LDL cholesterol [16,17,18,19,20,21]. Only Bunner et al. [19] reported its slight increase in the control group by 0.4 mg/dL; in other studies, a reduction was observed in both intervention (varying from −13.5 mg/dL [16] to −2.8 mg/dL [20]) and control groups (from −12.7 mg/dL [21] to −1.0 mg/dL [20]). In intervention groups, the statistical significance was reached in three studies [16,18,21] and in control groups in two studies [16,21], with the mean in-between group difference significant in the study of Mishra et al. [18].",
        "Relatively uneven results were observed assessing triglyceride levels; all studies reported changes from baseline to final values, expressed in mg/dL. Only Wheeler et al. [15] reported the change as the Area Under Curve (AUC). In the intervention groups, four studies noticed a reduction [14,15,16,17] (varying from −33.9 mg/dL [16] to −4.4 mg/dL [17]) and four an increase [18,19,20,21] (from + 4.7 mg/dL [19] to + 20.8 mg/dL [21]) in triglyceride levels, and only in two studies were these changes significant [16,18]. In the control groups, six studies reported a decrease [14,15,16,18,20,21] (from −38.93 mg/dL [14] to −2.9 mg/dL [18]) and two studies an increase (by + 3.5 mg/dL [17] and + 21.9 mg/dL [19]) in this variable, and significance was only observed in the study of Barnard et al. [21]. Only in the study of Mishra et al. [18] was the mean in-between group statistical significance reached, although Lee et al. [20] observed a marginal significance.",
        "It is worth saying that in the study of Ferdowsian et al. [17] and Mishra et al. [18], not all participants, in whom the cardiometabolic risk factors mentioned above were measured, had DM.",
        "Evaluating renal function, four studies reported diverse outcomes: Nicholson et al. [14] and Barnard et al. [16] evaluated the 24 h microalbuminuria. A decrease was observed in the intervention groups from 434.3 mg/24 h to 155.2 mg/24 h and from 33 mg/24 h to 20.2 mg/24 h in the study of Nicholson et al. [14] and in the study of Barnard et al. [16], respectively. Conversely, an increase (from 82.9 mg/24 h to 169.2 mg/24 h in the study of Nicholson et al. [14] and from 55 mg/24 h to 69.5 mg/24 h in the study of Barnard et al. [16]) was noticed in the control groups; however, none of these changes reached statistical significance (for a wide range of baseline values in the study of Nicholson et al. [14]), but the mean in-between group difference was resulted as marginally significant in the study of Barnard et al. [16]. Additionally, in the study of Barnard et al. [21], the 24 h albuminuria was assessed, but the authors expressed this outcome as median mg/dL. Differently from previous studies, a significant increase in albuminuria was observed in the intervention group, while in the control group values, dropped insignificantly, with a significant mean in-between group difference. Wheeler et al. [15] measured other parameters: Albumin Excretion Rate (AER), Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and Renal Plasma Flow (RPF). However, there were not any significant differences in the change from baseline to 6 weeks or between the intervention and the control groups.",
        "Changes in clinical outcomes from baseline to final values by group assignment are summarized in Supplementary Tables S2–S10.",
        "Finally, Bunner et al. [19] evaluated the impact of the vegan diet on pain in chronic diabetic neuropathy. Different questionnaires or scales assessing the painful and sensory symptoms, as well as the electrochemical skin conductance as a measure of sudomotor nerve function were chosen as outcomes. From all these parameters, the foot conductance and two questionnaires (Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire and Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument-questionnaire) reached the statistically significant mean in-between group difference in favor of the 20-week intervention diet.",
        "Lower DM prevalence among vegetarians compared to omnivores has been observed for decades, but it was well documented only recently, in particular through population studies of Seventh-Day Adventists. This religious movement originated in the United States and promotes a healthy lifestyle through the adherence to the vegetarianism with the avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, illegal drugs and caffeine-containing beverages. The rate of vegetarianism (including pesco-vegetarians and semi-vegetarians) in the Adventist Health study-2 was high; about fifty per cent and 4.48% of them were following vegan diets [12]: the prevalence of T2D in subjects aged 30 years or older was 2.6 × higher among nonvegetarians than in vegans. Different results were observed in an Indian population [13], where no significant reduction in DM prevalence among vegans was observed. There are some explanations: as an affiliation with veganism was self-reported, it is possible that the term “veganism” in the Indian context was not interpreted correctly. Indian vegans may include butter, ghee (a type of clarified butter derived from cow’s milk that contains fewer dairy proteins, but similar fat content than regular butter) or honey in their diet. Another important factor is the consumption of refined (white) rice: it is well documented that its higher consumption increases the rate of T2D [22]. Second, many Indian vegans do not practice this lifestyle due to personal health, environmental sustainability or political reasons. Third, there was no information reported regarding the type of DM. As the population was quite young (aged 20–49 years), we can presume that a number of participants who reported the presence of DM was affected by type 1 diabetes, which incidence is not correlated with the diet.",
        "Neither in the study of Tonstad et al. [7] evaluating the incidence of DM in the same cohort of Adventist Health study-2, the type of diabetes was not specified, but we presume that the most of new cases was T2D since the mean age of subjects that reported DM was 62.5 years. Beside the vegan diet, also the lacto-ovo-vegetarian and semi-vegetarian (flexitarian) diets were protective against DM compared to non-vegetarians in non-Black participants (OR 0.684, 95% CI 0.542–0.862, OR 0.501, 95% CI 0.303–0.827, respectively). The semi-vegetarian diet was defined as a consumption of any type of meat one or more times per month, but less than once a week—we may equate it with a classic Mediterranean diet. Among Black subjects, only vegan and lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets were associated with a decreased risk of DM.",
        "The major limitations of the included observational studies are that the diet assessments were self-reported and that in cross-sectional studies, the dietary habits may not be maintained in time. Nowadays, many individuals define themselves “vegans”, although they may include little animal product in their diet, especially after following the strict diet for a longer time [1]. Another point is that vegans may consume some foods that we do not consider healthy, such as chips, sweetened beverages or white rice. Obviously, the studies that dichotomously classified dietary patterns as vegan, various types of vegetarianism or omnivorous [7,11,12,13], may lead to a misclassification. On the contrary, several studies [8,10] investigated the variation in the degree of having a plant-based versus animal-based diet, considering the quality of plant foods consumed may not have this problem [8].",
        "All randomized controlled studies reported the reduction in HbA1c levels after the vegan diet, although the duration of the intervention varied from 6 to 74 weeks. Besides the length of follow-up, there are many other factors that make it difficult to compare the results among studies: duration of disease, medication regimens, baseline HbA1c value, changes in medication during the intervention, baseline BMI, etc. It is worth noting that much of the effect of the intervention diets on glycemia appears to be mediated by weight reduction. Even more arduous is the comparison between the vegan and the omnivorous groups, as control diets in the included studies were not always neutral in energy balance and the approaches were different. In the vegan groups, mostly no restrictions in portion sizes, energy or carbohydrate intakes were placed; on the contrary, in some control groups, calorie-restricted diets were prescribed. These limitations are conclusive not only for the glycemic control parameters, but also for other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, etc.). We can presume that for some patients with T2D, the vegan diet may be an efficient way to lose weight and maintain glycemic control.",
        "Besides the randomized controlled studies included in this systematic review, a recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies has also confirmed that the intake of plant-based proteins is significantly associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality (pooled effect size 0.88, 95% CI 0.80–0.96) [23].",
        "Despite the fact that the vegan diet is high in carbohydrates, all clinical trials included in this review have demonstrated its effect on glucose lowering, which is even stronger than that seen in other hypocaloric conventional diets recommended for people with DM [16,20]. This effect may be attributed to higher fiber content.",
        "Dietary fibers lower the postprandial glucose response by well-known mechanisms such as the reduction in gastric emptying and consequent slower starch digestion and glucose absorption. Additionally, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) plays an important role; besides a slower gastric emptying action, it improves glucose uptake and disposal in peripheral, especially in insulin-dependent tissues. GLP-1 reduces glucose production from the liver through the inhibition of glucagon secretion [24]. Some prospective cohort studies suggest that only cereal but not fruit or vegetable fiber intake is associated with reduced long-term risk for T2D [25,26].",
        "Another important factor by which we may explain the benefits of the vegan diet on different cardiometabolic risk factors is the lower fat content. It has been demonstrated that fat-rich diets lead to an increased intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) concentration through the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes downregulation in skeletal muscle [27]. Excessive IMCL storage has a cytotoxic effect on mitochondria through reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and increased metabolic stress which promotes the insulin resistance [28]. In fact, Goff et al. [29] have noticed a significantly minor content of IMCLs in the soleus muscle among 21 vegans compared to 25 omnivores, while IMCL contents in other muscle types were not significant (tibialis and gastrocnemius). Surprisingly, insulin sensitivity, expressed through the HOMA index (%S) was similar in both groups, albeit the fasting glucose level was significantly lower and beta-cell function (HOMA %B) significantly higher in vegans. Moreover, beyond the quantity, the type of fat consumed also has to be considered and it has to be stated that the connection between IMCLs and insulin sensitivity is not an absolute cause–effect relationship.",
        "The improvement of insulin sensitivity was observed in correlation with lower serum ferritin levels several years ago [30], and later, it was well documented that the consumption of meat, especially red and processed, favors the development of T2D across increased insulin resistance [31]. As the vegan diet is absent of heme iron, we may suppose an enhancement of insulin sensitivity in vegans.",
        "It is well known that vegans are at risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as proteins, vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D, iron, zinc or omega-3, if not well planned [32].",
        "Many clinical studies have demonstrated that plant-based proteins have lower anabolic capacity compared to animal proteins due to their lower digestibility and higher limiting essential amino acid content (such as lysine in cereals or sulfur amino acids in legumes), which are more likely directed toward oxidation rather than being used for muscle protein synthesis. On the other hand, prospective cohort studies suggest that the difference in the anabolic effects of plant versus animal-based proteins could be reduced with an adequate protein intake (1.0–1.2 g of proteins/kg of body weight) or by blending different plant-based protein sources (e.g., cereals with legumes), which could mitigate sarcopenia, a common condition in elderly, especially in those with diabetes [33].",
        "It is essential that all vegans get enough vitamin B12, as this micronutrient is generally found only in animal-sourced foods and its deficiency prevalence among vegans is high [34]. Nevertheless, vitamin B12 supplementation or the consumption of fortified foods among vegans is common, and often, its deficiency is not significantly higher than in omnivores [35]. An increased attention should be paid in subjects taking metformin, the first line pharmacotherapy in T2D, as it may lower B12 status [36].",
        "Calcium and vitamin D are crucial for maintaining healthy bones and preventing osteoporosis, although the other nutrients listed above may also play a role. Vegans may be at higher risk of lower bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures due to an inadequate intake of these nutrients. Iguacel et al. [37] has confirmed the significantly lower total body BMD (mean difference—MD −0.059, 95% CI −0.106 to −0.012), lumbar spine BMD (MD −0.070, 95% CI −0.116 to −0.025) and femoral neck BMD (MD −0.055, 95% −0.090 to −0.021), as well as the significantly higher fracture risk (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.439, 95% CI 1.047–1.977) in vegans than in omnivores. As DM is associated with increased fracture risk [38], it is strongly recommended to encompass adequate calcium and vitamin D intake through diet or supplementation, as well as screen diabetic patients who follow a vegan diet for osteoporosis.",
        "We can conclude that many large observational studies have demonstrated that the vegan diet is associated with lower T2D prevalence or incidence, although in some cohorts, it is not possible to distinguish if the beneficial effects derive from the vegan diet alone or from the overall healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, the results of randomized controlled studies performed in T2D patients have indicated its antihyperglycemic effect, even in the long-term.",
        "Moreover, clinical trials with vegan diet in pre-diabetes and T2D people, in which the quantity of simple and complex carbohydrates and the quality of the nutrients taken will be evaluated, should be conducted. In this way, some unevenness of results obtained in the different reported clinical trials could be clarified and an appropriate vegan diet for pre-diabetic and T2D individuals could be created to be used as a nutraceutical intervention.",
        "Finally, the vegan diet may be considered an acceptable and safe alternative to Western diets and seems to be comparable to other recommended healthful eating models (e.g., vegetarian, Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), etc.), but it must be stated that it has been considered to be a therapeutic diet with adverse effects associated with the long-term exclusion of some nutrients. Appropriate nutritional planning and surveillance conducted by dietitians and nutritionists trained in a vegan diet are recommended, as vegans are more likely to require vitamin B12 (especially who take metformin), vitamin D, calcium and iron supplementation, as well as a sufficient amount of protein. This is important, particularly in specific groups of diabetic patients such as frail elderly, adolescents, and pregnant and breastfeeding women.",
        "Larger randomized controlled studies are necessary to confirm the effectiveness and safety of the vegan diet for diabetic patients.",

        "Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a 30 or 31 amino acid long peptide hormone mainly secreted by 3 tissues in the human body: enteroendocrine L cells in the distal intestine, alpha cells in the pancreas, and the central nervous system (1). Through its interaction with the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), GLP-1 participates in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. In addition, glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) can be combined with GLP-1Rs, playing the same role as GLP-1. A variety of GLP-1RAs and analogues, such as exendin-4 and liraglutide, has been used successfully in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (2). At present, the therapeutic application and potential value of GLP-1RAs in diseases other than diabetes has become a research hotspot. Interestingly, GLP-1RAs have been reported to activate the metabolism of brown fat and increase the energy expenditure in rodents through exercise activities independent of the sympathetic nervous system pathway (3). Liraglutide has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for long-term weight management (4). Moreover, GLP-1RAs have been shown to exert many beneficial effects on vascular endothelial cells. For instance, GLP-1RAs were demonstrated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events (5) by decreasing the blood pressure (6), improving microvascular function, and reducing inflammation (7). Further, GLP-1RAs play a neuroprotective effect by stimulating the differentiation of nerve cells and inhibiting neuroinflammation (8), while they were also reported to inhibit liver inflammation (9). These findings indicated that in addition to playing a role in the treatment of diabetes, GLP-1RAs can also be used in the treatment of other diseases, such as certain neurological diseases, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and diseases related to metabolic disorders. Many studies on the correlation between the function of GLP-1RAs and the development and progression of tumors are also underway. Related studies (10) have found that GLP-1RAs can inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK/MAPK pathways, thereby inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer; however, whether GLP-1RAs increase the risk of pancreatitis remains controversial (11). We here attempted to systematically review the mechanisms of action and therapeutic value of GLP-1RAs.",
        "Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is the second incretin identified in 1983. The first identified incretin was a gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) with the activity of inhibiting the secretion of gastric acid, which was isolated from porcine small intestines (12). Briefly, GLP-1 exists in the human body in two active forms, GLP-1 (7-36 amide) and GLP-1 (7-37), with the proportion of GLP-1 (7-36 amide) being higher (8, 9). The half-life of natural GLP-1 is very short. Depending on the species, the half-life is approximately 1 to 2 min (13). There are two reasons for this: (1) after its recognition by dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4), GLP-1 is cleaved into GLP-1(9-36) amide, which is in a low affinity; (2) kidney clearance. Glucagon like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a member of the B family of G protein-coupled receptors. In the pancreas, the interaction of GLP-1 and GLP-1R is known to mainly act through the cAMP-PKA pathway. More specifically, the interaction of GLP-1 and GLP-1R activates adenylate cyclase (AC), which stimulates the conversion of ATP to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), thereby increasing the concentration of cAMP. In turn, cAMP further activates protein kinase A (PKA) and Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 4 (RAPGEF4, also known as EPAC2) (14). The activated PKA can close the ATP-dependent K+ channel and depolarize the cell membrane, while also activate the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel, causing a Ca2+ inflow and the generation of action potentials (15). In addition, PKA can also promote Ca2+ release by activating inositol triphosphate (IP3). The activated EPAC2 can further activate Ras protein 1 and phospholipase C, which activate the IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG) pathways and promote the release of Ca2+ (16). All these pathways eventually lead to an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, thereby promoting the mitochondrial synthesis of ATP, and the release of insulin particles into the blood through exocytosis. Apart from the pancreas, GLP-1R is also widely distributed in various tissues of the body including the lungs, kidneys, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, and skin and vagus nerves (17). This distribution breadth of GLP-1R further highlights the diversity and importance of its biological functions.",
        "Glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are emerging glucose control drugs, which are widely used in the treatment of T2MD in recent years. Due to the wide distribution of GLP-1R, GLP-1RAs also have a wide range of pharmacological effects. At present, existing GLP-1RAs mainly include 2 types: polypeptide and non-polypeptide (18). Based on similarities in their amino acid sequence, peptide agonists are mainly divided into GLP-1 and derivatives and exendin-4 and derivatives. Common GLP-1RAs are listed in Table 1. In addition to lowering the levels of blood glucose, as shown in Figure 1, GLP-1RAs have also been shown to have a positive effect on multiple human tissues. Liraglutide, which has been approved for reducing the risk of T2MD, has also been found to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with established CVDs (19). Accordingly, the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association recommend it as a second-line drug after metformin, suitable for patients with known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (20). Moreover, liraglutide was reported to reduce the abnormal proliferation of hyperglycaemia-induced vascular smooth muscle cells by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT and ERK 1/2 signaling pathways (21). Due to the metabolic regulatory function of GLP-1RAs, they have also been considered for the treatment of other diseases such as obesity, liver disease and other metabolic dysfunction diseases (22).",

        "In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mice (23), liraglutide was shown to inhibit the MKK4/JNK signaling pathway, thereby improving the hypoadiponectinemia-induced inflammatory stress. In addition, GLP-1RAs (24) have also been found to play an active role in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Besides, the protective and therapeutic effects of GLP-1RAs on the central nervous system have now been confirmed by several studies (25, 26). In particular, they have been reported to stimulate nerve differentiation, enhance synaptic plasticity, promote nerve cell survival, and prevent and treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), stroke and other neurological diseases by regulating the expression of some key enzymes and the release of certain neurotransmitters (27). In addition, a number of studies have also shown that GLP-1RAs has a positive effect on the treatment of certain tumors (10).",
        "Autoradiography of human tissue sections with 125I-labelled GLP-1 (7-36 amide) revealed a high content of GLP-1R in the central nervous system suggesting its potentially important role in the nervous system (28). More specifically, GLP-1R is widely expressed in the periphery of the central nervous system, including the hippocampus, neocortex, hypothalamus, spinal cord and cerebellum (29). In recent years, a variety of mechanisms for the beneficial effects of GLP-1RAs on the brain have been discovered, including the reduction of neuroinflammation and increase of signal transduction in surviving cells. In addition, they have been shown to enhance synaptic transmission and counteract learning deficits (30, 31). A recent study found that exendin-4 could improve the reference memory ability of adult rats (32). The use of GLP-1RAs could promote the proliferation of adult rodent neural stem cells, indicating their role in promoting brain regeneration (33, 34). The therapeutic effect of GLP-1RAs on neurological diseases has been confirmed by several studies.",
        "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease, with unclear aetiology and pathogenesis. Approximately 6-8% of people over the age of 65 suffer from AD; this risk is known to increase with age, and is more common in women (1.5 times compared with men) (35). A study has suggested that the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits triggers a series of pathological processes, such as inflammation, tau angle formation, synaptic dysfunction, and cell death, which lead to neurodegenerative behavior and eventually to the development of dementia (36). According to some researchers, the abnormal accumulation of Aβ and tau protein is the cause of AD (37, 38). However, some studies have indicated that these are manifestations and not the cause of the disease (39, 40). The main pathological features of AD include the deposition of insoluble Aβ that forms senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal apoptosis (40). Neurofibrillary tangles have been found in the amygdala, hippocampal structure, parahippocampal gyrus, and temporal cortex of patients with AD, whereas senile plaques have been shown to be distributed throughout the combined neocortex and striatum (41). Interestingly, AD has been associated with a dysfunction in insulin signaling in the brain. A Rotterdam study has shown that the risk of AD in patients with T2MD is increased by 2-fold (42). Moreover, insulin resistance(IR) has also been reported in the brain of patients with AD. Due to IR, the brain cannot use glucose, thus leading to inflammation and the deposition of plaques and tangles (43).",
        "In an AD mouse model, GLP-1RAs were demonstrated to reduce the levels of AD pathological markers, including oligomeric antibodies and antibody plaque load, reduce the activation of microglia, and improve memory behavior (35, 44, 45). Furthermore, GLP-1RAs were found to protect hippocampal neurons from cell necrosis caused by glutamate, Fe2+ and hypoxia. Calcium is also known to play an important role in neuronal plasticity and neurodegenerative diseases. In a study using cultured rat hippocampal neurons, pre-treatment of nerve cells with GLP-1 resulted in a weakened Ca2+ response to glutamate and weakened membrane depolarization (46). Whole-cell patch clamp analysis showed that glutamate-induced currents and voltage-dependent calcium channel currents were significantly reduced in GLP-1-pre-treated neurons. Pre-treatment of neurons with GLP-1 significantly reduced the susceptibility of glutamate-induced neuronal death. A basic study suggested that semaglutide protects neurons from Aβ toxicity potentially through the enhancement of autophagy and the inhibition of apoptosis (47). Zhou et al. found that the protective effect of dulaglutide on learning and memory impairment might be the result of reducing the hyperphosphorylation of tau and neurofilament proteins in a PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway-dependent manner (48). Two types of GLP-1RAs, liraglutide and exenatide, were found to be antagonistic to the neurodegeneration and AD progression even in mice without diabetes (35, 49). McClean et al. (35) showed that systemic administration of liraglutide in AD transgenic mice for 8 weeks could prevent memory impairment, neuronal loss, and deterioration of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. In addition, according to the numbers of activated microglia, liraglutide could significantly reduce both the deposition of amyloid plaques and inflammation (50). Similarly, in rats injected with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the hippocampus, pre-treatment with liraglutide significantly protected from the mAbs-induced damage of spatial memory and long-term potentiation (51). Importantly, liraglutide was not only shown to have a preventive effect, but also reversed some of the key pathological features of late AD in mice (52). Another GLP-1 analogue, exenatide, has also shown promising results against neurodegenerative diseases in a pre-clinical study (53). Conclusively, GLP-1RAs have great research potential in the field of AD treatment.",
        "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system and the second most common neurodegenerative disease after AD (54). It mainly affects the motor nervous system, and is associated with the loss of Lewy bodies and substantia nigra dopamine neurons (55). The Lewy body is a neuron inclusion body, mainly composed of α-synuclein (56). Dopamine, which acts as a neurotransmitter, is known to play a key role in movement control. However, the reason behind the loss of these dopamine-producing nerve cells remains unclear (57). The most obvious symptoms of PD in the early stages are tremor, limb stiffness, decreased motor function and abnormal gait. Cognitive and behavioral problems might also manifest. In the late stages of PD, the key molecular pathogenic mechanisms include the misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired protein clearance (related to inefficient ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal systems), neuroinflammation and oxidative stress (57). To date, no therapeutic approach has been shown to either completely cure PD or delay, stop, and reverse the degeneration and death of dopaminergic neurons (58). Therefore, effective neuroprotective therapies are continuously being pursued. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that GLP-1 analogues can cross the blood-brain barrier, protect dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and rescue motor activity and cognitive functions in PD animal models (59–61). These findings have strongly supported the hypothesis that the use of GLP-1RAs might be a novel effective treatment for PD.",
        "Disturbance of insulin signaling in diabetic patients might lead to the abnormal expression of αSyn, damage to mitochondrial function, increase in mitochondrial oxidative stress, and down-regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which in turn could promote the occurrence and development of PD (62). Surprisingly, GLP-1RAs, such as liraglutide, lixisenatide, and semaglutide, have showed outstandingly neuroprotective effects on animal models of PD (63, 64). Bertilsson et al. found that intraperitoneal injection of exendin-4 increased the number of BrdU-positive progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (33), indicating that exendin-4 could compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the PD model by promoting the formation of substantia nigra neurons. Similarly, in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model, GLP-1 analogues were reported to protect the brain from MPTP-induced pathological effects, such as movement disorders, increased levels of α-synuclein, chronic inflammation in the brain, loss of dopaminergic neurons, oxidative stress, and expression of growth factors (65). The novel GLP-1RA geniposide was found to up-regulate the expression of β-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), whereas reduce the activity of caspase 3, thereby protecting dopaminergic neurons in a MPTP mouse model of PD (66). Inflammation is increasingly recognized as a key factor in the pathogenesis of PD (67). Therefore, the regulation of the activity of microglia is believed to play a key role in the neuroinflammation of PD. Positron emission tomography of patients with early PD showed a significant increase in the activation of microglia (68), which might lead to neuron loss in PD and AD (69).",
        "Injection of exendin-4 into rodents after endotoxin and mTP toxin-induced damage to the substantia nigra striatum could prevent the toxin-induced activation of microglia and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (70). Mitochondrial function interference or mitochondrial damage is also one of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of PD (71). Interestingly, GLP-1RAs have also been shown to exert multiple effects on mitochondria. For example, saxagliptin protected the mitochondrial function in PD rat models by up-regulating complex I and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (72), while long-term use of exendin-4 in rodents promoted the function of hippocampal nerves, and improved motor function and behavior (73). Moreover, GLP-1RAs were shown to protect neurons and induce beneficial changes in neuroplasticity in laboratory models of several neurological diseases, including PD (31). In a pre-clinical trial, patients with moderate PD who received subcutaneous injection of 2 mg exenatide once a week had an advantage of 3.5 points in the mds-updrs exercise scale over the placebo group (74). Zhang et al. found that semaglutide could reverse the decrease in the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, alleviate inflammation, and increase autophagy, thus protecting dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra and striatum (75). Another study showed that the incidence of PD diagnosed with T2DM varies greatly depending on the administered diabetes treatment. Compared with other oral hypoglycemic agents, the prevalence of PD when using DPP4 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs was shown to be 36-60% lower (76). These results indicated that GLP-1RAs might play a useful role in the future treatment of PD.",
        "Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability worldwide. Strokes are mainly divided into hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes caused by blood vessel obstruction. Strokes are mostly caused by arterial occlusion, which in turn leads to cerebral ischemia, brain damage, and then nerve damage and disability. Typical symptoms of stroke include sudden unilateral weakness, numbness or loss of vision, diplopia, changes in speech, ataxia, and non-orthogonal vertigo (77). Atypical symptoms include isolated vertigo, blindness in both eyes, amnesia, agnosia, dysarthria, dysphagia, stridor, headache, hemiplegia, confusion, and changes in consciousness (77). The pathological mechanism of stroke mainly includes the apoptosis of neurons in the cerebral cortex and striatum. As neurological and medical complications after stroke are not properly predicted, prevented, or dealt with, they are considered to constitute the main cause of the high morbidity and mortality associated with strokes (78). In addition, T2DM is associated with an increased risk of stroke and mortality after stroke (79). Interestingly, GLP-1RA antidiabetic drugs have shown a distinct effect in reducing the incidence of stroke and enhancing neuroprotection in both pre-clinical and clinical studies (80, 81).",
        "A pre-clinical study showed that exendin-4 had a remarkable neuroprotective effect, improving the neurological deficit caused by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice, and reducing neuronal loss and microglial inflammation (82). Acute administration of exendin-4 at the beginning of the stroke or 1 h later was reported to have a significant effect; however, this neuroprotective effect disappeared after 3 h. The neuroprotective effect of exendin-4 was found to be independent of the glucose-increasing effect, whereas related to increasing the levels of cAMP and reducing oxidative stress and the inflammatory response (83). Relevant studies have found that exendin-4 could mediate the neuroprotective effect on γ-aminobutyric acid neurons in the piriform cortex and striatum and play a neuroprotective role in a cAMP/PKA- and PI3K/AKT-dependent manner after stroke (84, 85). Sato et al. found that intraperitoneal injection of liraglutide 2.5 h after stroke induced neuroprotection in rats, which was related to the up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (86). A study on the protective mechanism of liraglutide on cortical neurons after ischemia suggested that liraglutide probably reversed the ischemia-induced apoptosis by activating the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways (87). Another study on the effect of dulaglutide on stroke showed that dulaglutide reduced the incidence of stroke in middle-aged and elderly people with T2MD and other cardiovascular risk factors, but it cannot reduce the severity of stroke (88). A trial of reperfusion therapy for ischemic stroke indicated that semaglutide, which has a strong GLP-1R-mediated neuroprotective effect, could reduce the infarct size in acute ischemic stroke in non-diabetic rats (89). In addition, the activation of GLP-1R was shown to promote synaptic plasticity and axonal growth (30), and stimulate adult neurogenesis (90). These findings might lay the foundation for the potential regenerative treatment of patients with chronic stroke.",
        "Pain is an unpleasant subjective and emotional experience related to actual or potential tissue damage (91). Pain can be divided into acute and chronic pain (92). Compared with acute pain, chronic pain is known to be much more harmful to the human body (93). Continuous pain can induce more serious pathological reactions in the human body, and even cause shock or death. Therefore, the treatment of chronic pain is even more important. Clinically, treatment drugs for chronic pain are mainly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics, opioid analgesics, and auxiliary drugs: such as antidepressants and anxiety drugs (94). However, the adverse reactions caused by these drugs often limit their application. In particular, long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause gastric mucosal damage as they can inhibit mitochondrially encoded cytochrome C oxidase I (MT-CO1, also known as COX-1) and block its protective effect on gastric mucosa. Therefore, the use of NSAIDs is usually associated with damage to the gastrointestinal tract and other systems during treatment, and thus need to be used with caution (95). In recent years, there have been numerous crises caused by the abuse of opioids. The nervous system can quickly develop tolerance to the drug. Overuse of opioids might lead to serious consequences, such as respiratory depression, addiction, and even death (96, 97). Studies found that intrathecal injection of GLP-1RAs effectively reduced formalin-induced peripheral nerve injury, as well as cancer- and diabetes-induced pain without causing serious adverse reactions. Moreover, it was also reported that long-term injection of geniposide and exenatide did not induce nociceptive tolerance (98, 99). Hence, GLP-1RAs (98) appear to be potential alternatives for the treatment of chronic pain due to their effect in reducing pain while not affecting acute injury. Previous experiments have found that exendin-4 could reduce the pain-induced neuro-inflammatory response through the GLP-1R pathway, thereby promoting the recovery of cognitive function in mice (100). Likewise, the anti-dipeptidyl peptidase-IV GLP-1RA ROSE-010 was shown to effectively relieve the intestinal pain induced by irritable bowel syndrome (101). However, there have been relatively few studies on the mechanism of GLP-1RAs in the treatment of chronic pain.",
        "Surprisingly, a recent study found that liraglutide blocked the lipopolysaccharide-induced visceral allodynia in a NO-dependent manner. It was suggested that this was achieved by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reducing the increase in intestinal permeability (102). As shown in Figure 2, following stimulation of GLP-1R by exenatide on microglia, the cAMP/PKA/p38β/CREB signal transduction pathway is activated, promoting the expression of IL-10. Subsequently, the IL-10 receptor/STAT3 signaling pathway in microglia is autocrinally activated, thereby promoting the expression and release of β-endorphin, the latter acts on μ-opioid receptors on neurons to produce analgesic and neuroprotective effects (103–105).",
        "Spinal microglia GLP-1R/IL-10/β-endorphin analgesic pathway. IL-10 stimulates the GLP-1R activation-induced microglial expression of β-endorphin and neuropathic spinal cord anti-allergic response in an autocrine manner. The figure is modified from Ref 103.",
        "The various aforementioned GLP-1RAs are peptides that are easily hydrolyzed by proteases, thus making their oral use basically ineffective. Therefore, discovering a small molecule GLP-1RA that could be orally administered is a current but extremely challenging research hotspot. Interestingly, W-24 (106), a non-peptide GLP-1RA, has been reported to inhibit inflammatory pain by stimulating the spinal cord GLP-1R for the release of analgesic β-endorphin. Moreover, as a small molecule drug, it could increase the confidence of in-depth research to find oral GLP-1RAs in the treatment of chronic pain.",
        "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main cause of premature death among Chinese individuals (107). In the cardiovascular system, GLP-1R is known to exist not only on cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, but also in the autonomic nervous system, Figure 3 suggests that GLP-1R may have direct and indirect effects on the heart and blood vessels. Moreover, it has been reported that GLP-1RAs increase the heart rate to a certain extent. However, this effect is soon weakened, not affecting the normal heart rate (108). The cardioprotective effects of GLP-1RAs include anti-inflammatory actions, reduction of myocardial ischemia injury, modifications in the synthesis and secretion of lipids, and improvement of endothelial dysfunction (109). A cardiovascular prognosis evaluation trial of semaglutide in the treatment of T2DM reported that administration of semaglutide reduced the cardiovascular prognostic risk (110). Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying the effects of GLP-1RAs in the cardiovascular system remain unclear. Many studies have shown that GLP-1RAs can treat certain CVDs, such as atherosclerosis and hypertension, and the suggested mechanism involves more than blood glucose control (111, 112). Therefore, the benefits of GLP-1 and GLP-1-based therapies for the cardiovascular system have attracted increased attention from clinicians.",
        "The effect of GLP-1RAs on the cardiovascular system. GLP-1RAs have direct and indirect effects on the cardiovascular system. Endocrine factors can ameliorate the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.",
        "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a fibrolipopathic formation on the arterial wall and a main cause of death worldwide. In particular, superimposed thrombosis is responsible for the most devastating consequences of AS, such as heart attacks and strokes. Elevated levels of plasma cholesterol constitute the most important factor in the development of AS (113). Briefly, the development of atherosclerotic lesions requires the action of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which carries cholesterol through the blood (114). Over time, AS plaques form fibrous caps and accumulate calcium salts. Advanced AS plaques can often invade the arterial lumen, obstruct blood flow and cause tissue ischemia. In addition, following the collapse of an aneurysm, its contents are released in the blood flow, inducing thrombosis; the formed thrombus then blocks the lumen, also inducing tissue ischemia; usually with a more rapid onset (115). Inflammation is also known to be a key factor in the development of AS: the aggregation of white blood cells, mainly macrophages, is a significant feature of AS from its initial to its late stage (116).",
        "A number of studies has found that semaglutide and liraglutide could reduce the levels of blood lipids and blood pressure (BP), hence contributing to the reduction of atherosclerosis and CVDs (117–119). Moreover, GLP-1RAs were reported to inhibit the development of AS in animal models. The anti-AS effects of GLP-1RAs include the regulation of inflammation (109), reduction of intima-media thickening (120), improvement of blood lipid profile (121), and regulation of endothelial dysfunction (122); however, the specific mechanism remains unclear.",
        "As mentioned, GLP-1RAs can reduce the content of systemic inflammation markers. Importantly, controlling inflammation is believed to contribute in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (123). In one study, liraglutide and semaglutide were reported to mitigate the development of plaque lesions by changing the inflammatory pathway in a mouse model of AS (124). Besides, GLP-1RAs might be driven by anti-inflammatory mechanisms to inhibit the formation of macrophage foam cells and thus slow down the pathological processes of AS (125, 126). Liraglutide was found to directly affect the formation of atherosclerotic lesions by tilting the macrophage population to the M-Φ-2 phenotype that is conducive to decomposition (127). Although this was demonstrated in animal experiments, GLP-1 was shown to exert acute anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects on humans under specific conditions. Interestingly, these effects were found to not be simply regulated through the control of the levels of insulin (123). A number of studies has found that liraglutide prevented these AS effects of ox-LDL by preventing the inhibitory effect of the p53 protein on kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) of human aortic endothelial cells (114, 128). Of note, KLF2 has been shown to play an important role in protecting vascular endothelial cells from ox-LDL and oscillatory shear damage. As such, this finding provides a new option for preventing the development of AS. Another GLP-1 analogue, lixisenatide, was reported to prevent the acuteness of cardiovascular events in apolipoprotein E−/−insulin receptor substrate 2+/− (APOE−/−irs2+/−) mice by reducing the size of AS plaques, increasing plaque stability, and promoting the conversion of macrophages to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype (129). In addition, liraglutide could also induce the cell cycle arrest of vascular smooth muscle cells through the AMPK pathway, thereby delaying the formation of AS (130). Although there is no GLP-1RA approved for the treatment of AS, these findings could provide novel approaches for the treatment of AS.",
        "Hypertension poses an increasingly serious public health problem worldwide. Hypertension can be divided into primary and secondary hypertension. Secondary hypertension is usually associated with an earlier age of onset, no family history, and a clear cause, such as renal or endocrine disorders, or iatrogenic triggers, such as the use of oral contraceptives (131). However, 90-95% of cases of hypertension are essential hypertension. Essential hypertension mostly occurs in middle-aged and elderly people, and is the result of the combination of lifestyle and genetic factors (132). Hypertension is the most common preventable risk factor for CVDs (including coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral artery disease), chronic kidney disease, and cognitive impairment, and also the main single factor for deaths and disability worldwide (133). The pathophysiological mechanism of hypertension is very complicated. The human body has a complex mechanism for maintaining the levels of blood pressure, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, natriuretic peptides, endothelial-sympathetic nervous system, and the immune system (134). Genetic factors are also implicated in the development of hypertension. For instance, the pathogenesis of essential hypertension involves multiple genes; certain allelic variants of several genes have been associated with an increased risk of essential hypertension, and almost all cases are known to be related to a familial history of hypertension (135). Finally, vasoactive substances produced by vascular endothelial cells are also important factors in the regulation of blood pressure.",
        "A meta-analysis conducted by Wang et al. (136) showed that GLP-1RAa have the effect of lowering blood pressure. In particular, they found that the activation of GLP-1R promoted the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and lowered blood pressure. In animal experiments, the GLP-1RA liraglutide was found to stimulate the secretion of ANP by increasing the levels of Epac2, which is a downstream target of GLP-1R signaling in cardiomyocytes (132), However, this finding seemed to contradict the results of clinical studies in which no increase was observed in the levels of ANP in healthy people and patients with T2MD. A study of patients with T2MD and congestive heart failure found that their levels of ANP were increased, whereas blood pressure was decreased, indicating that the GLP-1R-ANP axis is only active in patients with congestive heart failure (123). Despite the controversies about the expression of GLP-1R in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, studies have shown that GLP-1RAs have anti-proliferative effects on these cells, and also reduced oxidative stress and increased the production of nitric oxide (NO) (137, 138). These effects have been confirmed in animal experiments, but not in humans, and the specific mechanism remains unknown. Nonetheless, these findings have already suggested the protective effect of GLP-1RAs on hypertension and atherosclerosis.",
        "Interestingly, GLP-1RAs not only exert a protective effect on the nervous and cardiovascular systems, but also exhibit a regulatory effect on metabolism. Figure 4 illustrates the potential pathways of the function of GLP-1RAs against multiple diseases. For instance, GLP-1RAs can improve the levels of insulin, regulate the levels of sex hormone, improve the blood lipid profile, increase the levels of adiponectin, regulate autophagy, inhibit the production of liver glucose, reduce the liver fat content, as well as reduce the levels of plasma liver enzymes and liver steatosis. They can also be used to prevent and treat endocrine disorders or metabolic diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (135).",
        "GLP-1RAs are involved in a variety of disease pathways. GLP-1RAs can activate several signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, p-AMPKα/NOX2/JNK1/2, Wnt/β-catenin, Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin, NF-κB/RANKL, and MKK4/JNK pathways thus exerting a therapeutic effect in different diseases.",
        "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is mainly manifested as sparse ovulation or non-ovulation, high levels of androgens, ovarian polycystic changes, obesity, and infertility, is the most common endocrine and metabolic disorder in women of childbearing age (139). When accompanied by metabolic disorders, such as IR and dyslipidaemia, it can lead to hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. In addition, skin problems such as hirsutism and androgenic alopecia cowing to the excessive levels of androgens might also occur (140–143). Although the pathogenesis of PCOS has not been fully elucidated, recent studies have indicated that excess levels of androgens might be the main pathogenic causative factor of PCOS (144–146). Patients with PCOS are frequently characterized by other symptoms, such as obesity and IR (147).",
        "In women with PCOS, high concentrations of leptin have been reported to inhibit the expression of aromatase mRNA in granulosa cells, while the hyperandrogenic follicular environment in GCs was found to significantly reduce the expression of P450arom, which can convert androgens into estrogen, further increasing the levels of androgens and ultimately promoting follicular atresia (148–150). The high levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) are the main manifestation of obesity. Briefly, FFAs can reduce the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 by activating the serine/threonine kinase, thereby aggravating IR (151). Moreover IR in PCOS was shown to destroy the effect of gonadotropins, enhance the sensitivity of follicular membrane cells to the luteinizing hormone, and increase the expression of P450c17 and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, leading to increased production of androgen (152). Concomitantly, the increased levels of insulin reduce the binding of liver sex hormone binding globulin SHBG to testosterone, leading to hyperandrogenism (153). Increased evidence have suggested that higher levels of androgen might cause follicular dysplasia, which is the main cause of insufficiency of ovulation (154).",
        "Related studies have indicated a causal relationship between IR and all clinical symptoms of PCOS, with weight loss being shown to improve the reproductive function, hyperandrogenism and metabolism of women with PCOS (155, 156). Accordingly, GLP-1RAs have been increasingly used in the treatment of PCOS because of their ability to reduce weight and improve IR (155–159). Surprisingly, most studies have shown that GLP-1RAs not only can reduce the weight of patients with PCOS, but also have a positive effect on the levels of androgens (160, 161). However, there have been few studies on the potential mechanism of the action of GLP-1RAs in the treatment of PCOS. Some studies have suggested that the proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells (GCs) are the root causes of follicular development and atresia, with forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) playing an important role in promoting PCOS follicular atresia and GCs apoptosis (162, 163). The GLP-1/GLP-1R axis was demonstrated to enhance the activity of PCOS ovarian granulosa cells by partially modifying the FoxO1 phosphorylation sites, thereby promoting oocyte maturation (164). In addition, liraglutide was found to repair the cognitive impairment in a rat model of PCOS by inhibiting the overexpression of the Notch signaling pathway (165). Therefore, GLP-1RAs appear to have a beneficial role in the treatment of POCS; however, the specific mechanism of action needs to be studied in depth (166).",
        "Obesity, as a chronic recurrent disease, is known to increase the risk of developing T2MD, hypertension, dyslipidemias, CVDs, NAFLD, and other diseases, leading to a poor quality of life and increased mortality (167). Obesity is considered to be related to increased appetite, changes in the levels of gastrointestinal hormones, increased fat mass, and disorders of satiety and satiation mechanisms (168). A recent trial on the treatment effect of semaglutide in people with obesity reported the significant effects of the long-acting GLP-1RA semaglutide on body weight and related phenotypes (169). Besides, it was found that semaglutide could regulate food preference, as well as reduce food intake and weight without reducing energy consumption (170).",
        "A randomized controlled trial found that GLP-1 mimics, such as exenatide and liraglutide, had a significant weight loss effect on obese/overweight patients without diabetes (171). Likewise, once a week administration of efpeglenatide, a long acting GLP-1RA, significantly reduced the body weight in obese patients (172). Interestingly, supplementation of metformin with 1.5 mg dulaglutide per week in the treatment of T2MD in obese patients with severe impairment of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was reported to bring lasting benefits in the control of glucose metabolism and body weight (173). Moreover, there was no difference in weight changes between exenatide and abiglutide, and both were shown to exhibit remarkable weight loss effects (174). The GLP-1RAs-associated weight loss is thought to be achieved through a variety of mechanisms, including the delayed gastric emptying, increased satiety, increased resting energy expenditure, as well as the direct influence of the appetite center of the brain (175).",
        "As GLP-1Rs are expressed in multiple brain regions, and GLP-1RAs such as liraglutide and lixisenatide can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, liraglutide and exendin-4 can be vagus-dependent or independent in the suppression of the food intake (176). Semaglutide is considered to control energy intake and reduce body weight probably by activating at discrete sites in the hypothalamus to reduce food craving, or by delaying the gastric emptying to affect appetite (119, 177, 178). In addition, GLP-1RAs could adjust the levels of the satiety signal in the arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus, thereby increasing satiety and reducing caloric intake (179). Various studies have found that GLP-1RAs can play a role in controlling obesity through a variety of signaling pathways (180, 181). For example, they have been shown to activate the Wnt signaling pathway to promote adipocyte differentiation; while they could also rely on SIRT1 to mediate lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in adipose tissues. When GLP-1RAs act on the gastrointestinal tract, they could extend the gastric emptying time. However, inhibiting gastric emptying mainly plays a role in reducing postprandial hyperglycaemia, and hence might not be the main mechanism of weight loss (176). In addition, GLP-1RAs could also increase energy consumption. Under the regulation of AMPK in the ventral medial hypothalamus, they could promote the conversion of visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown adipose tissue (BAT), promoting thermogenesis of BAT and thus energy consumption (182). Finally, most patients could develop a tolerance mechanism to reduce or eliminate the GLP-1RAs-induced adverse reactions (182), thus allowing their use as drugs of choice for the treatment of obesity.",
        "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic stress liver injury closely related to IR and genetic variations. It is also known to be closely related to the T2MD metabolic syndrome, and the morbidity and mortality of CVDs (183, 184). About 10%-25% of patients with NAFLD will develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which increases the risk of liver cirrhosis or liver cancer (185). A number of studies has suggested that IR might be the main mechanism of NAFLD (185, 186). Moreover, the increased morbidity and mortality in patients with NASH is known to be closely related to the severity of liver fibrosis. It has been shown that an increased percentage of fat, adipose tissue dysfunction, and IR lead to increased levels of FFAs and carbohydrates. These conditions of excessive lipid toxicity and metabolic load eventually lead to the accumulation of liver lipids, cell damage, inflammation, and fibrosis (187, 188).",
        "A prospective study found (189) that 1 year after bariatric surgery, NASH was eliminated in 85% of patients, indicating that weight loss was closely related to the histological improvement of fatty liver. Oxidative stress also seems to be an important pathophysiological mechanism of NAFLD (190).",
        "As mentioned above, GLP-1RAs possess multiple biological effects, such as lowering the levels of blood glucose and blood lipids, reducing body weight, and protecting the cardiovascular system. A previous study of liraglutide on mice fed a diet lacking methionine and choline also found that GLP-1RAs not only could improve IR, but also reduce harmful ceramide/nerve sheath types, and reduce NAFLD inflammation and fibrosis (191). Liraglutide could also improve hepatic steatosis and ballooning degeneration in patients with NASH (192). A 72-week, double-blind phase 2 trial showed that once-daily administration of semaglutide had a significant therapeutic effect on NASH (193). Long term use of beinaglutide, a recombinant human GLP-1(7-36) acid, was demonstrated to reduce the body weight and improve steatosis (194). Several studies found that GLP-1RAs might have direct effects on adipogenesis, lipotoxicity, fatty acid oxidation, cytokines related to hepatitis and fibrosis, and intestinal microbiota (193, 195). Therefore, GLP-1RAs are of great significance in the treatment of NAFLD.",
        "As mentioned, GLP-1RAs can treat NAFLD through multiple mechanisms. Adiponectin was reported to reduce NAFLD inflammation through the AMPK-JNK/ErK1/2-NFκB/ROS signaling pathway, also exhibiting insulin sensitization and liver protection (196). A recent report covered that tirzepatide increased adiponectin levels and significantly decreased Nash related biomarkers, which was beneficial to improve NAFLD (197). In NAFLD mice, liraglutide could improve the hypoadiponectinemia-induced inflammatory stress by inhibiting the MKK4/JNK signaling pathway, inhibit liver adipogenesis by activating AMPK, and induce autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway, hence improving the levels of liver lipids (23, 198). Further studies have shown that the SIRT1/HSF1/HSP pathway plays an important role in the exenatide-induced reduction of lipid-induced liver endoplasmic reticulum stress (199, 200). Concomitantly, autophagy was reported to also reduce the hepatocyte apoptosis caused by steatosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress, possibly through the GLP-1RA-stimulated GLP-1R-mediated activation of the EB transcription factor of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, thus reducing the accumulation of liver lipids (201). Therefore, GLP-1RAs appear to serve as novel candidates for the treatment of NAFLD.",
        "To date, a large number of epidemiological investigations have confirmed that the occurrence of endometrial cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer is positively correlated with T2MD (202, 203). In addition, hyperinsulinemia in diabetic patients seems to be the main reason for an increased risk of cancer (204). Figure 5 illustrates the effect of diabetes on the tumor cell microenvironment and intracellular signaling transduction. The high levels of insulin have been shown to reduce the levels of the Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein, which can tightly bind to IGFs, resulting in excessive free IGF-1 in cells and tissues. In turn, the levels of IGF-1 have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cancer (204, 205). Therefore, patients with T2MD are more likely to suffer from several malignancies compared with healthy individuals. However, selecting the right drug for the treatment of diabetic patients with malignancies is a difficult clinical decision. As mentioned, GLP-1RAs are increasingly used in the treatment of T2MD owing to their following advantages: lowering of the levels of blood glucose, reducing body weight, improving the function of islet, and exerting potential cardiovascular benefits (206). Whether GLP-1RAs could also affect the occurrence and development of tumors has been the focus of attention only in recent years.",
        "The effect of diabetes on tumor cell microenvironment and intracellular signaling transduction. Diabetic patients can increase their levels of insulin and stimulate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MAPK, and Jak/Stat signaling pathways in different ways, thereby inhibiting cancer cell apoptosis and promoting the spread, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Solid arrows indicate strong affinity for the receptor, and dashed arrows represent weak affinity for the receptor. The figure is modified from Ref 204.",
        "A meta-analysis of clinical studies indicated that treatment with GLP-1RAs of obese patients with T2MD did not increase the risk of breast tumors, nor did it increase the risk of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and overall tumor neoplasia (207–209). Furthermore, Gier et al. found that the use of GLP-1RAs in diabetic patients might not increase the risk of new thyroid tumors in patients with T2MD (208). Related studies have found that GLP-1RAs could limit the growth of prostate cancer by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK/MAPK pathways, while could also limit the growth of pancreatic and prostate cancer cells by inhibiting the NF-kB pathway (210–212). Similarly, GLP-1RAs were also demonstrated to exert an inhibitory effect on the growth of breast and cervical cancer, implying the potential application of GLP-1RAs for the treatment of these cancer (10). Zhang et al. reported for the first time that liraglutide exhibited significant anti-proliferation and pro-apoptotic effects on gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic cancer cells resistant to a variety of drugs, by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway and downstream ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) (213, 214).",
        "Likewise, Wenjing et al. found that exendin-4 could reduce the resistance of prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide by targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, while combined use of exendin-4 and enzalutamide could significantly inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells (210). Therefore, a combination of GLP-1RAs with anticancer drugs could indirectly inhibit the migration, invasion, and growth of tumors by increasing the chemosensitivity of cancer cells. Interestingly, this approach seems to be more effective for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer (210, 215).",
        "Liraglutide and exenatide were reported to induce apoptosis and autophagy through the AMPK signaling pathway, inhibiting the progression of endometrial cancer (216, 217). In addition, exenatide was shown to activate GLP-1R and inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway to inhibit the growth, migration, and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, and promote cell apoptosis, thereby producing anticancer effects on diabetic patients with ovarian cancer (218). Besides, exenatide-4 has been found to inhibit the survival, migration, proliferation, and invasion of glioma cells in a GLP-1R/SIRT3 pathway dependent manner (219). The continuous in-depth research on the effects of GLP-1RAs on the occurrence and development of cancer in recent years have highlighted the increased potential for their use in the clinical treatment of cancer.",
        "Unfortunately, the occurrence of some adverse events has caused deep concern about the long-term safety of GLP-1RAs. A population-based matched case (220) controlled study found that the treatment of patient with T2MD with exenatide might increase the chance of hospitalization for acute pancreatitis. In addition, Knapen (221) also found that the use of incretin drugs could increase the risk of pancreatic cancer by 1.7 times. However, because of the limited statistical power, insufficient follow-up time, and confusion about the severity of the disease, the researchers could not effectively conclude whether a direct relationship existed between the use of exenatide and the occurrence of acute pancreatitis. On the contrary, a systematic review on mortality, as well as cardiovascular and kidney statuses in patients with T2DM treated with GLP-1RAs concluded that there was no increase in the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, or pancreatic cancer (222). Cao (11) conducted a meta-analysis of 7 cardiovascular follow-up test results and discovered that the use of GLP-RAs was not correlated with the increased risk of pancreatic cancer. In contrast, they considered that obesity might be a risk factor for the development of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer (223). Through rigorous scientific experiments, Zhao et al. showed that the activation of GLP-1R by liraglutide led to an anti-tumor effect on human pancreatic cancer via the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway (224). In addition, a large-scale clinical study demonstrated that GLP-1 analogues could reduce the mortality of patients with prostate cancer and diabetes (19). Conclusively, with regard to patients with pancreatic cancer and diabetes, GLP-1RAs have the potential to treat pancreatic cancer while also controlling the levels of blood glucose (210, 224). A study on whether and how the activation of GLP-1R affects proliferation and apoptosis of human pancreatic cancer cells has demonstrated that GLP-1RAs might activate cAMP in a GLP-1R-dependent manner, subsequently inhibiting the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, hence inhibiting the growth of transplanted tumors in vivo, as well as inducing apoptosis and inhibiting the proliferation of a human pancreatic cancer cell line in vitro (\n225). All the aforementioned results have suggested that GLP-1RAs are safe and beneficial for the treatment of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.",
        "To date, no clear clinical evidence has been found to suggest the tumorigenic effect of GLP-1RAs (226), whereas plenty of studies have indicated that GLP-1RAs can inhibit the growth of ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer (227, 228). However, our understanding of the function of GLP-1RAs is not complete, and further research, including long-term and large clinical trials are warranted to properly evaluate the causal relationship between GLP-1RAs and the development and progression of various cancers.",
        "Overall, GLP-1RAs are considered novel blood glucose lowering drugs used in the treatment of T2MD (229), owing to their advantages of lowering blood pressure, lowering the levels of fasting blood glucose, lowering HbA1c, inducing weight loss, and being associated with a low incidence of hypoglycemia. In addition, GLP-1RAs are valuable in the treatment and prevention of diseases of the nervous and cardiovascular system, endocrine disorders, or metabolic diseases due to their neuroprotective, cardiovascular protective, and metabolic regulatory effects. However, there are still many controversies regarding the tolerability and adverse reactions of GLP-1RAs in the treatment of diabetes. Almost all diseases and drug treatments are inevitably associated with side effects, such as nausea and vomiting. Surprisingly though, a second-generation GLP-1RA conjugate composed of vitamin B12 and exendin-4 was reported to reduce the adverse reactions, exhibiting improved tolerance (230). Another imminent problem is that the GLP-1RAs that are currently used in the clinical setting are biological macromolecular peptide preparations, such as exenatide and liraglutide, with high production costs that limit their clinical application (231). One obvious advantage of the small molecule agonists in the replacement of peptide GLP-1 analogues is that they could be administered orally, thus avoiding the discomfort of subcutaneous injections and increasing the compliance of patients. Nowadays, LY3502790 and PF-06882961 (231–233), a class of oral non-peptide small molecule GLP-1RAs with preferable efficacy and anti-diabetes potential, are at the stage of pre-clinical research. Such developments are expected to greatly increase the confidence of patients regarding the improved efficiency and tolerance of GLP-1RAs. Therefore, we believe that the discovery of low-cost oral GLP-1RA analogues or synergists and the continuous elucidation of the possible mechanism of action of GLP-1 are of great significance for the expansion of the field of disease treatment.",
        "GLP-1RA is a new type of drug for the treatment of T2MD. Recent studies have found that GLP-1RAs have therapeutic effects on neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic diseases. More and more studies are looking for oral GLP-1RA analogs or synergists to enhance its therapeutic effect. This article systematically summarizes the extra-pancreatic effects of GLP-1RAs, and discusses the therapeutic effects and possible mechanisms of GLP-1RAs on various diseases. We believe that this article is of great significance to the research field and can provide ideas and directions for follow-up research.",

Recent cardiovascular outcome trials have demonstrated that agents in two antidiabetic classes (SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists) reduce major adverse cardiovascular events. However, there is strong evidence that an older and now generically available medication, the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone, can retard the atherosclerotic process (PERISCOPE and Chicago) and reduce cardiovascular events in large randomized prospective cardiovascular outcome trials (IRIS and PROactive). Pioglitazone is a potent insulin sensitizer, preserves beta-cell function, causes durable reduction in HbA1c, corrects multiple components of metabolic syndrome and improves nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Adverse effects (weight gain, fluid retention, fractures) must be considered, but are diminished with lower doses and are arguably outweighed by these multiple benefits. With healthcare expenses attributable to diabetes increasing rapidly, this cost-effective drug requires reconsideration in the therapeutic armamentarium for the disease.

        "Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a progressive disease that has been occurring with rapidly increasing morbidity because of the ageing of the population (1). With the progression of aortic valve stenosis (AVS), the extent of cardiac damage gradually increased from left ventricle to right ventricle (2). Although mortality did not increase when AVS was asymptomatic, the 2-year mortality was more than 50% for patients with symptomatic stenosis (3, 4). Emerging evidence has indicated that CAVD was an active and regulable pathological process in which the risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, were similar to those of other cardiovascular diseases (5, 6). However, lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin, simvastatin and ezetimibe, or rosuvastatin did not prevent the progression of CAVD (7–9). There are currently no effective pharmacotherapies to retard or reverse the progression of CAVD. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are the only effective treatments for end-stage CAVD.",
        "Patients with diabetes were at increased risk of developing various cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, peripheral artery diseases, and CAVD (10). According to large-scale retrospective observations worldwide, the prevalence of diabetes in CAVD ranged from 11.4% to 31.6%, and increased by almost 50% in the recent decade (11–14). It was worth noting that the prevalence of diabetes in CAVD undergoing TAVR or SAVR also increased rapidly in recent years (13–16). Diabetes stood as a major risk factor for developing hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and ageing (17), which were all associated with the initiation of CAVD (\nFigure 1\n) (18). The combination of diabetes with these cardio-renal and metabolic comorbidities accelerated the progression of CAVD and increased the subsequent needs for aortic valve replacement (AVR). The underlying mechanism of diabetes and its comorbidities involved endothelial dysfunction, immune cell infiltration, oxidative stress, lipid retention, as well as subsequent osteogenic and myofibroblastic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) and eventual calcification (18, 19). Once fibrosis and calcification of the aortic valve initiated, the majority of patients developed AVS progressively (20).",
        "Risk factor and time course of diabetes concomitant to calcific aortic valve disease. Shown is the relationship among disease stage, risk factor, molecular link, valve anatomy, stage of cardiac damage, and the age of the patient. The morbidity of aortic valve stenosis (dashed line) increased rapidly with age. Once in symptomatic stenosis, the mortality of aortic valve stenosis (solid line) increased rapidly.

        "Diabetes was generally considered as an adverse factor in patients with cardiovascular diseases needing surgical or invasive interventions. The impact of diabetes on AVR manifested with various complications, such as CAD, acute kidney injury (AKI), heart failure, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). However, clinical data regarding the impact of diabetes on outcomes of patients undergoing AVR have exhibited inconsistent results. The short-term mortality after SAVR was significantly lower in diabetes according to the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database, while another Spanish study found no difference in short-term mortality between diabetes and non-diabetes patients (14, 21). Diabetes was found as a risk factor for mid-term mortality after TAVR in a meta-analysis including 64 studies (22). However, according to the VARC-2 criteria, diabetic patients did not have increased mid-term mortality after TAVR compared with non-diabetic patients (23). There is currently no article that has summarized the influence of diabetes on clinical outcomes after AVR.",
        "In this review, we present the prevalence of diabetes in CAVD. Then, we discuss the underlying mechanisms of diabetes and its comorbidities in CAVD. Most importantly, we discuss the controversies of clinical outcomes in diabetic patients undergoing TAVR or SAVR. Finally, we summarize updated knowledge about the influence of diabetes on the deterioration of bioprosthetic aortic valve (BAV).",
        "With the ageing of the population, the incidence rate of diabetes concomitant to AVS has increased rapidly by years (\nTable 1\n). The CURRENT AS registry, enrolling 3,815 consecutive patients with CAVD in Japan between 2003 and 2011, showed that 11.4% of patients had concomitant diabetes (11). The multi-central, prospective, observational PRIMID AS study, conducted in 10 hospitals in the United Kingdom between 2012 and 2014, showed that 14.4% of patients with moderate to severe AVS had concomitant diabetes (12). Another study, performed in the Swedish population-based cohort study, showed that the prevalence of diabetes was 15.8% in severe AVS (24). In recent decades, the incidence of AVR increased rapidly in CAVD with diabetes. A retrospective analysis of patients with SAVR between 1987 and 2016 in Netherlands revealed that the prevalence of diabetes has increased from 7.8% to 17.9% over three decades (15). Likewise, the retrospective data from Spanish cohorts (2001–2015) showed that the prevalence of diabetes increased significantly from 16.7% to 23.5% in patients undergoing SAVR (14). The MedPAR file, reporting trends in demographic characteristics associated with isolated AVR in the United States, showed that the prevalence of diabetes increased from 19.7% to 31.6% between 2009 and 2015 in the SAVR cohort and increased from 34.2% to 36.8% between 2012 and 2015 in the TAVR cohort (13). According to the data from the National Inpatient Sample between 2012 and 2017, hospitalizations of diabetes undergoing TAVR increased from 0.97 to 7.68/100,000 adults (16). In the Danish nationwide registers, the prevalence of diabetes undergoing TAVR significantly increased from 14.2% in 2008–2010 to 19.4% in 2017–2018 (25). Overall, with the increased prevalence of diabetes undergoing AVR in recent years, the influences of diabetes on clinical outcomes after TAVR or SAVR have been getting more and more attention.",

        "Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia and manifested by various cardiovascular diseases. Recent research has found that a hyperglycemia-simulating environment attenuated experimentally induced osteogenic differentiation of cultured human VICs (26). To further mimic the events of aortic valve tissue in diabetic conditions, chronic hyperglycemia was assessed in valvular endothelial cells (VECs) and VICs via a gelatin methacrylate 3-dimension model (27). The gene expressions of MCP-1 and IL-1β were increased both in VECs and VICs after high-glucose treatment for 14 days, exhibiting changes of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and inflammation (27). However, in another dynamic three-dimension aortic valve leaflet model using a software-governed bioreactor system with controlled pulsatile flow, hyperglycemia did not exhibit any impact on fibrosis or calcification on the aortic valve (28). In vivo, LDLR-/-ApoB100/100 mice fed with diabetogenic diet had higher incidence of aortic valve incrassation and stenosis in comparison with normal chow (29). This controversial relationship between hyperglycemia and VIC osteogenesis indicated that there were other complicated mechanisms of diabetes on developing CAVD beyond sole hyperglycemia. Exposure to hyperglycemia in diabetes rapidly accelerated circulating advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation (30). Extracellular AGEs modified global tissue structure and function by binding to the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) (31). In a study on 76 patients undergoing AVR, both the plasma and valvular levels of AGEs were increased in patients with diabetes (32). Overexpression of valvular AGEs was associated with increased mean transvalvular pressure gradient, and overexpression of plasma AGEs was associated with aortic valve area and max transvalvular pressure gradient (32). In an animal model of CAVD, RAGE deficiency attenuated morphometric infiltration, calcification, and AGE accumulation in the aortic valve (33). In vivo, the knockdown of RAGE in high-cholesterol diet-fed ApoE-/- mice attenuated the expression of RUNX2 mRNA via NF-κB/ATF4/CHOP pathway (\nFigure 2\n Panel 5) (34).",
        "Pathway and molecular link between diabetes and calcific aortic valve disease. Pathological mechanism of initiation and progression of CAVD in diabetes was shown as crosstalk of various pathways. Different stimuli induced EndMT and broke the endothelial barrier, resulting in infiltration of lipoproteins and immune cells. This infiltration was accompanied by the overproduction of ROS via dysregulation of eNOS, and accumulation of NOX and MitoROS. Oxidative stress could promote the formation of OxLDL and OxPL, which induced osteogenic differentiation of VICs, and eventual bone formation. Apoptosis of VICs and subsequent diffuse calcification were induced by infiltrated macrophages, T lymphocytes and mast cells via direct interaction, activation of Ang II, and secretion TGFβ, TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6. Increased circulating AGEs induced the pro-osteogenic reprogramming via RAGE/NF-κB/ATF4/CHOP pathway. Diffuse calcification accounted for approximately 83% of all calcification deposits, while bone formation accounted for the other 17%. LDL, low-density lipoprotein; Lp(a), lipoprotein (a); EndMT, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition; ROS, reactive oxygen species; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; NOX, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, MitoROS, mitochondria-generated ROS; OxLDL, oxidized LDL; OxPL, oxidized phospholipids; Ang, angiotensin.",
        "Hypertension was the most common complication of diabetes, and 40–60% patients with diabetes would develop abnormal blood pressure or hypertension sooner or later (35). Patients with diabetes developed increased arterial resistance caused by vascular remodeling and increased circulating volume caused by hyperglycemia, both of which elevated blood pressure (36). Approximately 70% of the patients with AVS had concomitant hypertension (37). In a large-scale clinical observation involving a 5.4-million population without known valvular heart disease, long-term exposure to elevated blood pressure (median follow-up of 9.2 years) was associated with an increased risk of AVS (38). Specifically, each 20-mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure was associated with a 41% higher risk of AVS (38). VECs were the first cells to be affected by hemodynamic changes. There were pieces of evidence finding that hypertension could accelerate the progression of CAVD by hemodynamic flow disturbance, which could cause mechanical damage to the VECs, especially on the aortic side (39, 40). Under exposure to circulating stimulants, VECs could differentiate into mesenchymal valve progenitor cells, a precursor of VICs, in a process called endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) (19). A relatively high rate of EndMT led to a destruction of the endothelial barrier due to the loss of adherent junction (\nFigure 2\n Panel 1) (41). Lymphocyte and macrophage infiltrated into the aortic valve through a destroyed endothelial layer and secreted various procalcific and proinflammatory cytokines (42). TGFβ and IL-1β would in turn stimulate the EndMT of VECs (43, 44). When those pathological factors constantly existed in the aortic valve, endothelial-derived VICs could differentiate into the osteoblastic phenotype (19). Once the osteogenesis has been launched, RUNX2 served as the marker of calcification. The current hypotheses suggested that the activation of RUNX2 involved activated STAT3 or STAT5, which, due to activating inflammatory signaling, translocated into the nucleus and bound onto STAT binding sites in the promoter region of RUNX2, leading to the recruitment of additional transcription factors, co-transcription factors, and chromatin remodelers (45, 46).",
        "Abnormal lipids metabolism was one of the major comorbidities in diabetes, which has been recognized as a hallmark in the early stage of CAVD and could be detected long before calcium deposits by PET-CT (47). A genome-wide meta-analysis of 11.6 million variants in 10 cohorts, involving 653,867 European ancestry participants, supported a causal contribution of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), apolipoprotein B, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to AVS (48). In the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, which included 188,577 participants, the odds ratio for developing AVS per unit increase in lipid parameter was 1.52 for LDL (49), indicating that LDL-lowering medication might be effective in prevention of CAVD. However, three large-scale randomized clinical trials (RCT) failed to illustrate any significant benefit of LDL-lowering medication with statins on the prevention of AVS (7–9), indicating that further studies were needed to seek the association of other lipid indexes and CAVD. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoted the transformation of LDL to oxidized LDL (OxLDL) and the transformation of Lp(a) to oxidized phospholipids (OxPL), which have been proven to facilitate the osteogenic differentiation of VIC in vitro study (\nFigure 2\n Panel 2) (50, 51). OxLDL increased the expression of cell adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, which consequently promoted RUNX2 expression and calcific remodeling in the aortic valve (52, 53). Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid (LysoPA), the decomposition production of OxPL catalyzed by autotaxin, was overexpressed in calcified leaflets in comparison with normal leaflets (54). Further study has shown that OxPL and LysoPA could accelerate the osteogenic differentiation of VICs by binding to LysoPA receptor 1 (LPAR1), levels of which were also increased in calcified leaflets (55). Inhibition of LPAR1 decelerated the progression of AVS and calcium deposits in the aortic valve (56). LPAR1 could instigate a pro-calcific gene program in VICs via RhoA/NF-κB/BMP2 activation (56).",
        "As one of the major complications of diabetes, approximately 30–40% of patients with diabetes developed diabetic nephropathy eventually (57), which progressively caused CKD and was associated with increased mortality (58). The prevalence of CAVD ranged from 28% to 85% in patients with CKD (59). Even in stage 2 and 3 CKD, >30% of the patients were found to have detectable aortic and/or mitral valve calcification (60). Moreover, functional AVS was found in 9.5% of patients with CKD in comparison with 3.5% of the general population (61). Even when taking account of age, race, sex, diabetes, and hypertension, patients with CKD had a 1.2- to 1.3-fold increased risk of CAVD (61). Multiple mediators in CKD, including hyperphosphatemia, calcium–phosphate product, parathyroid hormone, and systematic inflammation, have been identified as risk factors of calcium deposition in the aortic valve (62). By conducting single-cell RNA sequencing with aortic valve leaflets excised from CAVD patients, VICs (72.64%) accounted for a major proportion among all cell types, followed by monocytic cells (19.52%), lymphocytes (6.23%), VECs (1.28%), and mast cells (0.33%) (63). Immunohistochemistry staining showed chronic immune cells infiltration on calcified valve leaflets, involving CD68+ macrophages, CD3+ T lymphocytes, and mast cells, while only few unactivated immune cells were exhibited in healthy valve leaflets (\nFigure 2\n Panel 4) (64, 65). Monocytes and macrophages activated the RUNX2 overexpression in VICs through secretion of TGFβ, TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 (66). Moreover, the release of extracellular vesicles from macrophages induced diffuse calcification due to the release of apoptotic bodies by VIC apoptosis (67). Likewise, the infiltrated CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes in diseased aortic valve induced apoptosis of VICs by direct interaction (68). The bulk of mast cells have been activated to degranulate and release chymase and cathepsin G in the calcified aortic valve, which both could convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II (69). Notably, exposure of VICs to angiotensin II promoted the expression of RUNX2, by binding to the angiotensin II receptor 1 (70). Accordingly, exposure of ApoE-/- mice to high-dose angiotensin II contributed to myofibroblastic differentiation of VICs and eventual aortic valve leaflet thickening (71).",
        "Ageing was a powerful independent risk factor for degenerative aortic valve disease. Diabetes was closely associated with ageing and was a major risk factor for ageing-associated cardiovascular diseases (72). Aortic valve calcification used to be viewed as a degenerative process, where calcification was thought to be the consequence of physiological ageing (5). Interestingly, a renewed characterization of the ageing aortic valve has emerged in recent years. Many prior studies that examined “healthy” elderly valves actually involved valve leaflets with calcification (73, 74), meaning that those data could not be used to define the characteristics of a normal, ageing valve. That was because the majority of samples in these references had come from individuals over 60 years old, and approaches and techniques have significantly evolved. Furthermore, while CAVD was considered a disease of old people, recent demographics showed that CAVD could be detected in the twenties, especially in those suffering from bicuspid aortic valve (75). Thus, diabetes-related pathological ageing probably participated more in the onset and development of CAVD compared with physiological ageing. Accelerated oxidative stress was a common factor in ageing and diabetes (76). Three major sources of ROS were uncoupled nitric oxide synthases (NOS), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX), and mitochondria-generated ROS (MitoROS) (77). Exposure of VECs to exogenous TNFα and H2O2 promoted endothelial NOS (eNOS) uncoupling, leading to increases in endogenous superoxide and H2O2 levels, which could promote ECM remodeling and calcium deposition in aortic valve (\nFigure 2\n Panel 3) (78). Recent evidence has demonstrated that isoform specific NOX-derived ROS might be involved in the development of CAVD. Intense NOX2 accumulation was found in VIC osteogenesis and in calcified regions of aortic valve leaflets (79). In hypercholesteremic mice, the mRNA level of NOX2 was increased in harvested valve leaflets, while no change was observed for NOX4 (80). Mitochondrion was a critical organelle responsible for both ROS production via end product from oxidative phosphorylation and ROS elimination via mitochondrial superoxide dismutase-mediated dismutation of superoxide (81). Loss of mitochondria was found in aortic valve leaflets excised from patients with CAVD and LDLR-/- mice fed with high-cholesterol chow (82). In cultured human VICs, treatment with Lp(a) promoted VIC osteogenic differentiation accompanied by MitoROS production (83). Our recent study revealed that both β-glycerophosphate acid and TGFβ treatment stimulated MitoROS production and RUNX2 expression in VICs, which was accompanied by decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction (82).",
        "Apart from direct effects of diabetes (e.g., hyperglycemia, AGEs/RAGE pathway, oxidative stress, EndMT, and inflammation), there were multifactorial interactions between those diabetic complications (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CKD, ageing), which participated jointly in the initiation and progression of CAVD. Hypertension-induced hemodynamic shear stress on the aortic side induced endothelial dysfunction and hampered barrier function, which exacerbated lipid deposition in an aortic valve under a hyperlipidemic condition (84). CKD caused hypertension through an interplay of factors, including water–sodium retention, renin–angiotensin system overactivation, and endothelial dysfunction (85), which were common pathological factors of CAVD. Hyperglycemia represented a key cellular stress in the kidney by altering cellular metabolism in endothelial cells and podocytes (86). Thereafter, increased oxidative stress and activation of inflammatory pathways caused progressive kidney function decline and fibrosis (86). Hyperlipidemia was associated with low-grade systemic inflammation, which might lead to insulin resistance, insulin deficiency, and consequent hyperglycemia (87). As two of the subsets of metabolic syndrome, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia jointly promoted CAVD via oxidative stress and chronic inflammation (84).",
        "TAVR was a percutaneous treatment option for symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis, especially among patients at high surgical risk (88). The prevalence of diabetes was up to a third of cases in TAVR patients (89–91). However, the association between diabetes and outcomes after TAVR procedure remained controversial (\nTable 2\n). Some studies described similar rates of complications (90, 92), while others reported higher (89, 91) or even lower 1-year mortality rates (93, 94). This controversy was represented in mortality risk prediction scores, which were based on data from surgical patients. STS-PROM score included diabetes as a risk factor (95). However, logistic EuroSCORE did not include diabetes as a risk factor (96), whereas EuroSCORE II only included insulin-treated diabetes (97). EuroSCORE II was the most accurate risk score with slight underestimation of actual mortality, whereas STS-PROM score and logistic EuroSCORE overestimated observed mortality (98). A meta-analysis including 64 studies with a total of 38,686 patients found that diabetes was associated with increased 1-year mortality after TAVR (22). Moreover, although insulin-treated diabetes was not associated with adverse outcome compared with orally treated diabetes, elevated HbA1c levels might be associated with increased mortality during long-term follow-up (99). Stress hyperglycemia ratio has recently been recognized as an accurate biomarker that represented true hyperglycemia status (100). In a prospective single-center study with a median follow-up of 3.9 years, stress hyperglycemia ratio was linearly associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients undergoing TAVR (101). However, according to the VARC-2 criteria, there were no significant differences of 30-day and 2-year mortality in patients undergoing TAVR between diabetes and non-diabetes (23, 99). Moreover, in a propensity matched analysis of multicentral registry including data from >12,000 patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR, diabetes was not associated with worse outcomes within the first year after TAVR, which underscored the safety of TAVR treatment in diabetes patients (98). Similarly, according to the data from the Spanish cohorts, diabetic patients undergoing TAVR did not exhibit increased in-hospital mortality compared with non‐diabetic patients (94). Further study has found some relationship between diabetes and TAVR in a specific cohort. An observational study of all consecutive patients treated with a transfemoral TAVR in a single-center cohort revealed that male patients with diabetes had significantly higher 3-year mortality compared with males without diabetes and there was no difference in 3-year mortality for female patients with and without diabetes, indicating gender-dependent association between diabetes and mortality after TAVR (102). Nevertheless, another observational study demonstrated that no influences of diabetes presence on the risk of 30-day and 1-year mortality after adjustment for age and gender (103). Anyway, in a post-hoc analysis of the PARTNER trial, diabetic patients were noted to have decreased 1-year mortality when treated with TAVR compared to SAVR (93). Overall, the short-term mortality after TAVR was not significant between diabetes and non-diabetes, while the mid-term mortality remained controversial. Taken together, these observations might tend to favor a transcatheter approach when either approach would be a reasonable option, particularly in those with diabetes. There is a need for RCT and large cohorts with long-term follow-up of diabetes vs. non-diabetes in patients undergoing TAVR (\nFigure 3\n).",

        "The risk factors of CAVD, including diabetes, hypertension, and CKD, were more involved in the disease development in patients with tricuspid aortic valves than those with bicuspid aortic valves (104). In asymptomatic moderate-to-severe AVS, patients with tricuspid aortic valves were older and had higher proportion of diabetes, compared with bicuspid aortic valves (104). However, the in-hospital mortality did not differ between transfemoral and transapical access in diabetes undergoing TAVR (105). Transfemoral access was associated with a higher incidence of vascular complications and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) implantation than transapical access (105). Especially, transfemoral access for TAVR was associated with higher mortality, acute stroke, AKI, hemodialysis, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in complicated diabetes with diabetes-related complications than in non-complicated diabetes (105). Although balloon pre-dilatation was not associated with device success or any post-procedural complications in TAVR procedure, there was less diabetes in pre-dilatation group (106). There were overall comparable outcomes between balloon-expandable and self-expanding valve for TAVR (107). In a subgroup analysis of in-hospital mortality, there was no significant difference concerning the type of valve in diabetes (108).",
        "The “abnormality” in in-hospital and short-term mortality in diabetes after TAVR might be attributed to diabetes-related obesity. The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and cardiovascular risk prediction was recognized as an “obesity paradox”. On the one hand, obesity has long been established as a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (109). On the other hand, increased BMI was found as a protective factor in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery or intervention (110, 111). Similarly, in comparison with normal-weight patients, patients who were overweight or had obesity had a lower incidence of 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality, and long-term mortality after TAVR (112). Obesity was one of the most common concomitant statuses in patients with diabetes. In patients undergoing TAVR, increased BMI was associated with increased rate of diabetes at baseline (113). However, obesity has been identified as an independent risk factor for vascular complications, PPI, and AKI in patients undergoing TAVR (114, 115). The association between obesity and other post-TAVR complications, including cerebrovascular events, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and myocardial infarction, has received emerging research attention. Therefore, the nuanced influence of obesity on TAVR outcomes necessitated deeper exploration, particularly considering the unique physiological and metabolic profiles inherent to individuals with obesity.",
        "CAD and CAVD were frequently concomitant due to similar risk factors, such as diabetes. About 25% of TAVR recipients have undergone PCI before TAVR in real-world TAVR registries (116). However, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at the time of SAVR has been considered the gold standard in such patients (117). More and more studies pointed to TAVR+PCI as an alternative method (118). Patients with prior CABG had higher rate of diabetes (119), which might be due to higher rate of three-vessel CAD and higher SYNTAX score in diabetes. As for prior PCI, diabetes was associated with increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (120). However, in stable CAD with diabetes, completeness of PCI either staged or concomitantly with TAVR was similar to undergoing TAVR without PCI concerning the all-cause death and MACE (121). As for acute coronary syndrome after TAVR, the concomitance with diabetes was associated with a higher rate of early mortality among patients undergoing urgent or emergent PCI (122, 123).",
        "Adjusted multivariate Cox regression analyses found that AKI was associated with increased risk of long-term mortality after TAVR (23). A meta-analysis of 64 studies showed that diabetes was associated with increased AKI after TAVR (22). Similarly, based on the data from 410 patients undergoing TAVR, kidney function improvement after TAVR was lower in diabetes than that in non-diabetes (124, 125). Among patients with end-stage renal disease, diabetes was one of the predictors of dialysis and readmission after TAVR (126–128). Diabetes was known to be a cause and prognostic factor for patients on dialysis. The influence of diabetes on kidney function after TAVR was mainly dependent on the baseline glomerular filtration rate and prior blood glucose control. Concomitance with diabetic nephropathy, especially with end-stage renal disease, might be associated with worse outcome after TAVR in diabetic patients.",
        "In TAVR, early findings showed that heart-failure-related death and sudden cardiac death accounted for approximately a third of total deaths and two-thirds of cardiac related deaths (129, 130). Among TAVRs with a newer-generation device including the self-expandable Evolut R/Pro/Pro+ valve and balloon-expandable SAPIEN S3/ULTRA valve, advanced heart-failure-related deaths accounted for 11.6% of total deaths and sudden cardiac death accounted for 7.5% of total deaths (131). Diabetes was independently associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in TAVR (131). The several possible mechanisms were silent myocardial ischemia, QT interval prolongation, diabetic cardiomyopathy, increased arrhythmogenic potential, and hypercoagulability (132). Patients with diabetes were at an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure at 1-year after TAVR (133, 134). Most of the patients obtained myocardial recovery after TAVR due to decreased cardiac afterload. However, post-TAVR left ventricular ejection fraction recovery was impaired in patients with diabetes (135, 136). Diabetes was associated with elevated left ventricular filling pressure and prior right ventricular dysfunction (137, 138), resulting in more severe heart failure symptoms and more loop diuretic therapy after TAVR (139). These residual myocardial injuries might explain the inferior manifestation of heart failure. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms might include changes in vascular homeostasis with diminished nitric oxide and increased ROS levels due to prolonged hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia, which activated pro-inflammatory pathways that resulted in the progression of atherothrombosis and dysfunction of the myocardium (140). Moreover, diabetes was associated with chronic and new-onset heart failure through neurohormonal dysregulation inducing cardiac fibrosis and decreasing cardiac efficiency (133).",
        "Post-procedural stroke was a devastating complication after TAVR and was associated with decreased long-term survival and reduced quality of life (141, 142). The national SWENTRY registry identified diabetes as one of the pre-disposing factors for stroke after TAVR (143). Up to 70% of the stroke was presented with clinically silent stroke or peri-procedural silent brain infarcts, which might be due to subclinical leaflet thrombosis (144). Meta-regression found that diabetes was associated with increased risk of silent brain infarcts (145). In prospective RETORIC trial, diabetes was an independent predictor of event of subclinical leaflet thrombosis (146). This should not seem surprising, as diabetes was independently linked to a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease, thereby reducing the insult threshold required for an ischemic event.",
        "Intraventricular conduction abnormalities, particularly high-degree atrioventricular block, requiring PPI were one of the major complications after TAVR procedure (147). New-onset left bundle branch block and diabetes independently predicted high-degree atrioventricular block requiring PPI after TAVR and helped to identify patients at risk (148–150). Moreover, post-TAVR PPI was associated with hospitalization of heart failure and myocardial infarction (150). However, there was still a literature finding diabetes as a negative predictor of PPI following TAVR (151). This contradictory result might be affected by confounders not included in the multivariate analysis, such as size of implanted valve and diabetic status.",
        "Previous work has reported that approximately one-third of patients developed an acute inflammatory response within 48 hours after TAVR (152). Therein, severe SIRS developed in approximately 6% of patients undergoing TAVR (153). This SIRS was manifested with significantly elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 or IL-8) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The occurrence of SIRS was shown to be a strong predictor of mortality in patients undergoing TAVR (153, 154). Previous study found that the presence of diabetes, increased baseline high sensitivity CRP, and low baseline Th2 cell counts were multivariate predictors of death after TAVR (155). Another study found elevated fasting glucose and CRP level as predictors of increased all-cause mortality after TAVR (156). As mentioned above, diabetes was associated with systematic inflammation in patients with CAVD. Plasma proteomics analysis of the biomarker cohort revealed that IL‐1 receptors, GDF15, and cathepsin D were significantly elevated and that pathways related to inflammatory response were enriched in diabetic CAVD patients (157). Overall, the chronic systemic inflammation status in diabetes would be activated to some extent in TAVR procedure, and the evocative severe SIRS was associated with the mortality.",
        "In order to prevent postoperative thrombosis and delay artificial valve dysfunction, dual antiplatelet therapy was routinely required after TAVR procedure. Long-term bleeding after TAVR was associated with an increased risk of subsequent mortality (158). Previous study found that patients with high bleeding risk after TAVR were more frequently presented with diabetes compared with those with lower bleeding risk (159). Moreover, there were some research studies finding that patients with diabetes had a higher risk of major bleedings compared with those without diabetes after TAVR (91, 160, 161). Nevertheless, there was another research finding no significant differences in major bleeding after TAVR between diabetes and non-diabetes (22). Baseline diabetes was not associated with baseline platelet reactivity levels in TAVR procedure (162). Similarly, there were biases against the role of diabetes on bleeding in other cardiovascular diseases (163). At present, there are no differences in the antiplatelet therapy strategy following TAVR between diabetes and non-diabetes. The absolute benefits of antiplatelet therapy were largely counterbalanced by the bleeding hazard.",
        "In recent decades, the incidence of bioprosthetic SAVR increased significantly in those with diabetes, which might partly be attributed to an increased prevalence of CAVD and an increased proportion of diseased patients diagnosed as such with ageing of population (14, 164). According to a retrospective study from Spanish cohorts, in‐hospital mortality was significantly lower in diabetes undergoing bioprosthetic SAVR than non-diabetes, which might be multifactorial (\nTable 3\n) (14). The impact of diabetes on short-term mortality after SAVR still remained controversial; diabetes has been found to be significantly and consistently associated to higher in-hospital mortality in a huge Spanish population after MACE, and there was no difference in 30-day mortality between diabetes and non-diabetes (21). However, the impact of diabetes on mid-term and long-term mortality after SAVR was consistent in several clinical studies. Long-term (5-year and 10-year) mortality was significantly higher in diabetes after SAVR compared with non-diabetes (19.4% vs. 12.9% and 30.3% vs. 23.5%) (165). A post-hoc analysis of the PARTNER trial, stratified according to the diabetes status of patients randomly assigned to undergo SAVR, revealed a 1-year mortality rate of 27.4% in diabetes and 23.7% in non-diabetes (93). This association was stronger among insulin-treated diabetes. In-hospital and long-term mortality rates were higher in the subgroup of insulin-treated diabetes compared with the subgroup of non-insulin treated diabetes (165). Insulin-treated diabetes had more comorbidities than non-insulin-treated diabetes and was prone to more revascularization procedures (166). Therefore, the results of mortality after SAVR in diabetes were partially dependent on the baseline diabetic status. Overall, the mid-term and long-term mortality rates after SAVR were higher in patients with diabetes than non-diabetes, while the short-term mortality remained controversial. There is a need for RCT and large cohorts with long-term follow-up of diabetes vs. non-diabetes in patients undergoing SAVR (\nFigure 4\n).",

        "Obesity was more prevalent in diabetes undergoing SAVR, which might have contributed to the decrease in in‐hospital mortality (167). The obesity paradox also indeed existed within the realm of SAVR. Post-SAVR complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, reoperation rates, AKI, new renal failure, requirement of dialysis, and postoperative bleeding were either more frequent in patients with higher BMI or equivalent to their normal BMI counterparts (168, 169). Therefore, the role of obesity in SAVR was disputable, regarding the integrated consideration of mortality and postoperative complications. As obesity was a worldwide problem and surgical techniques were advancing, identification of the underlying causes of the obesity paradox was essential to providing optimal care for patients of all body sizes undergoing SAVR.",
        "Recent retrospective studies revealed that concomitant SAVR and CABG were associated with a significantly higher in-hospital mortality, while there was no additional mid-term or long-term survival risk compared with isolated SAVR (170–172). In patients undergoing concomitant SAVR and CABG, diabetes was associated with 30-day, 180-day, and long-term mortality (170, 173). No RCT focused on the long-term survival of performing a concomitant CABG with SAVR are currently available. Long-term mortality was higher in diabetes vs. non-diabetes, and especially in insulin- vs. non-insulin-treated diabetes regardless of undergoing PCI or CABG (174). Although the long-term mortality was not different in diabetes treated either with PCI or CABG, lower mortality was observed in CABG in the cohort with three-vessel CAD and high SYNTAX score (175). Based on the potential organ-protective and anti-inflammatory effects, a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial for efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist exenatide and restrictive versus liberal oxygen supply in patients undergoing CABG with/without SAVR is in progress (176). The researchers intended to determine whether glucose-lowering medication could improve the outcomes in such high-risk patients.",
        "AKI was another serious complication after SAVR and held increased mortality. Diabetes was significantly associated with the development of AKI after SAVR (177, 178). Insulin-dependent diabetes was one of the predictors for post-SAVR renal failure with hemodialysis (179). Kidney recovery after SAVR was more frequent than AKI, which was associated with improved secondary clinical outcomes (180). Diabetes was a negative predictor of kidney recovery after SAVR (125), indicating less reversible kidney injury in diabetes. Compared with patients undergoing SAVR without hemodialysis, patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis had diabetes more frequently (181). Moreover, concomitance with diabetes was associated with increased 30-day mortality in chronic dialysis patients after SAVR (182). The conclusions in findings might be related to differences in patients’ controlled hyperglycemia, use of medications, and prior glomerular filtration rate, as diabetes was associated with ischemia and kidney injury.",
        "Although SAVR resulted in significant improvements of pre-existing myocardial impairments, concomitance with diabetes exhibited more residual changes in myocardial structure, contractile function, and blood flow (135, 183). It might be due to more cumulative myocardial injuries in diabetes prior to SAVR and persistent systematic diabetic toxicity after replacement. Therefore, diabetes was one of the independent risk factors of rehospitalization for heart failure after SAVR (184). The initiation and development of myocardial structural/functional abnormalities leading to heart failure in diabetes included multiple mechanisms, which remained incompletely elucidated (185). Nevertheless, they encompassed common systemic factors with CAVD, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, excessive production of AGEs, and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (186). Therefore, further studies are needed to explore the potential efficacy of glucose-lowering medications in alleviating both diabetic myocardial and aortic valve injuries.",
        "The concept of patient–prosthetic mismatch (PPM) after SAVR referred to the clinical situation in which a normally functioning prosthetic valve did not allow an adequate cardiac output without an excessive gradient across the aortic valve. The prevalence of moderate PPM ranged from 20% to 70% and that of severe PPM ranged from 2% to 20%, respectively (187). Clinical outcomes of patients with mild and moderate PPM were not significantly different to those without PPM, while severe PPM was associated with increased mid-term and long-term mortality after SAVR (188). Diabetes was one of the predictors of the prevalence of PPM in patients undergoing SAVR (189, 190). Diabetes was associated with the occurrence of mild and moderate PPM but did not have a significant effect on the occurrence of severe PPM (191). As PPM was only marginally associated with survival, it was not related to risk of reoperation after SAVR (192).",
        "SIRS developed in 11% of SAVR patients and was associated with a higher mortality after SAVR (153). Although diabetes was not associated with an increased risk of SIRS, severe SIRS had a greater effect on mortality in diabetes (153). Proteomics analysis of plasma from CAVD with diabetes found that IL-1 receptors, GDF15, and cathepsin D as well as the pathways associated with inflammation were significantly elevated (157). This systemic pro-inflammatory response might account for the worse clinical outcomes in diabetes undergoing SAVR.",
        "According to the latest 10-year outcomes of the NOTION trial, the rate of infective endocarditis was similar for both TAVR and SAVR (7.2% vs. 7.4%) (193). Once endocarditis occurred, the all-cause mortality increased rapidly, especially in the SAVR cohort (194, 195). Among patients with endocarditis, the rate of all-cause 1-year or 5-year mortality was higher in the SAVR group than that in the TAVR group (195). In the analysis of pooled statistics of three large RCT, patients with endocarditis after SAVR had diabetes more frequently at baseline than those without endocarditis (195). However, in the PARTNER 1 and PARTNER 2 trials, concomitance with diabetes was not associated with the occurrence of endocarditis after SAVR (194). The baseline clinical characteristics of patient population in different study, including age, previous CABG, and other valvular heart diseases, were disparate. The difference in those factors might account for the differences observed. Further RCT are needed to elucidate whether concomitance with diabetes is associated with the occurrence of endocarditis after SAVR and related mortality.",
        "Structural valve deterioration (SVD), manifested with leaflet calcification or fibrosis, was one of the pivotal factors limiting the durability of BAV and the prognosis after transcatheter or surgical replacement. Non-structural bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD), defined as any abnormality not intrinsic to the aortic valve, included PPM and paravalvular regurgitation, which occurred at the time of SAVR or TAVR procedure and existed persistently during follow-up, while SVD developed progressively during follow-up. The durability of BAV is becoming a critical problem of TAVR, as this procedure is now considered for younger and lower-risk populations with longer life expectancy (196). In a propensity-matched analysis of intermediate-risk patients (PARTNER 2 and PARTNER 2A), the incidence of SVD at 5 years was 3.9% in TAVR with balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 vs. 3.5% in SAVR (197). In the PARTNER 3 trial, the incidence of SVD at 5 years was 4.2% in TAVR with SAPIEN 3 vs. 3.8% in SAVR among low-risk patients (196). As for self-expanding CoreValve or Evolut, the CoreValve US High Risk Pivotal and SURTAVI trials found a lower rate of SVD in intermediate- or high-risk patients undergoing self-expanding TAVR vs. SAVR at 5 years (1.82% in TAVR vs. 2.67% in SAVR) (198). The only long-term NOTION trial revealed similar results in comparison between TAVR with CoreValve and SAVR (12.5% in TAVR vs. 13.9% in SAVR) (193). The CHOICE trial compared the first or second generations of SAPIEN with CoreValve in high-risk patients and found superior valve hemodynamic performance for self-expanding valves with lower rate of SVD at 5 years (199). The SMART trial also found that the self-expanding valve was superior to the balloon-expandable valve in the aspect of SVD at 1-year among patients with small aortic annulus (200). The superior performance of the self-expanding valve in SVD might be due to the supra-annular design with better hemodynamic properties. Large RCT with long follow-up are thus needed to compare the durability of different TAVR prostheses, especially among low-risk populations.",
        "Although deterioration of BAV has long been considered as a passive degenerative process, emerging studies revealed that active and potentially modifiable mechanisms might also participate in the fibrocalcific process of BAV (201). SVD shared common risk factors and similar pathological process with CAVD. One of the crucial risk factors that have been associated with SVD following TAVR or SAVR was diabetes (197, 198, 201, 202). In the PARTNER 2 trial, diabetes was associated with SVD at 5 years in the SAPIEN 3 TAVR cohort (197). In the prospective study of SVD after SAVR, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses found diabetes as one of the risk factors for deterioration of BAV and all-cause mortality (201). In another retrospective study, diabetes was associated with hemodynamic deterioration of BAV, especially at early years (202). Thus, concomitance with diabetes accelerated the deterioration of BAV and restricted the durability of BAV after TAVR or SAVR. The underlying mechanisms of SVD in diabetic conditions might include inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid retention, endothelial dysfunction, and AGEs/RAGE, which were similar to the molecular mechanisms of CAVD concomitant to diabetes as mentioned above. Diabetes was one of the predictors for the prevalence of PPM (189, 190), which in turn caused BVD after AVR. Bioprosthetic valve endocarditis was often associated with morphologic and hemodynamic valve deterioration and might thus lead to SVD (203). One of the prevalent predisposing conditions of prosthetic valve endocarditis was diabetes (204). The retrospective cohort study, conducted in five German cardiac surgery centers, multivariable analyzed 3,143 patients (73.1%) undergoing surgery for native valve endocarditis and 1,157 patients (26.9%) for prosthetic valve endocarditis (205). Patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis presented with higher proportion of diabetes than native valve endocarditis (205). Transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation was an alternative option in inoperable or high-risk patients with severe SVD (206). Age and diabetes were identified as independent predictors of all-cause 30-day mortality in patients with transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation (207). Currently, most of the clinically available BAVs are fabricated from glutaraldehyde-treated heterogeneous aortic valves or bovine/porcine pericardium (208). Previous studies have indicated superior hemodynamic characteristics in bovine pericardial valves compared to porcine valves (209, 210). Moreover, bovine valves were associated with better survival than porcine valves in diabetes (211). However, to date, no vitro or vivo experiments has specifically investigated the influences of diabetes on different bioprosthetic pericardial valves. Diabetes and its complications jointly participated in the deterioration of BAV, leading to increased long-term mortality and various complications after AVR.",
        "Once SVD developed into bioprosthetic valve failure, the death rate increased rapidly except in cases of transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation or transthoracic reoperation (203). However, there are currently no medications to prevent or reverse the progression of BAV deterioration. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) was a nuclear receptor that participated in various physiological processes as a transcriptional regulator (212). Activation of PPARγ by specific agonists, thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone, has been widely used for lowering glucose via insulin-sensitizing and pancreatic β-cell preserving effects (213). Apart from glucose-lowering effect, PPARγ agonists have also been found to have anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory effects via regulating the expression of related genes (214, 215). Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis found conservation of PPARγ in non-calcified human aortic valve leaflets and activated PPARγ pathway in CD36-positive VECs in hyperlipidemic mice (216). Many vitro and vivo studies have revealed the anti-calcification effect of PPARγ agonists in the degeneration of native aortic valves (30, 80). Moreover, its effect on the deterioration of BAV was assessed in various rat models. In the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, pioglitazone led to an inhibition of BAV deterioration, manifested with a lower expression of chondro-osteogenic genes and calcium deposits (217). In the guide wire injury-induced AVS rats as well as hypercholesterolemic and obese rats, systemic PPARγ activation inhibited inflammation and calcification in heterologous aortic valve conduits and seemed to inhibit functional impairment of the implanted aortic valve (218, 219). Overall, based on the protective effects for CAVD and BAV deterioration in vitro and vivo, PPARγ agonists are currently one of the promising glucose-lowering medications to inhibit deterioration of BAV probably independent of glucose control (\nFigure 5\n).",
        "Glucose-lowering medication option for patients with diabetes and deterioration of bioprosthetic aortic valve based on the efficacy for CAVD and ASCVD. ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; BAV, bioprosthetic aortic valve; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; DPP-4, dipeptidyl peptidase-4; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; SGLT-2, sodium–glucose co-transporter-2.",
        "Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been widely applied to treat diabetes via inhibiting degradation of GLP-1 to regulate insulin secretion (220). DPP-4 was widely expressed in the cardiovascular tissues and participated in the physiopathologic process of various cardiovascular diseases (221). Although multiple large-scale clinical studies have demonstrated statistical non-inferiority but not superiority for the DPP-4 inhibitors in the primary MACE endpoint (222, 223), recent studies have found that DPP-4 inhibitors showed benefits on various cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, CAD, and CAVD (224). In vitro, DPP-4 upregulation by nitric oxide deprivation-dependent NF-κB activation resulted in osteogenic differentiation of VICs (225). In vivo, DPP-4 inhibitors markedly reduced calcification of aortic valve in eNOS-deficient mice and rabbit fed with cholesterol-enriched diet and vitamin D (225, 226). DPP-4 inhibitors suppressed CAVD by alleviating inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification (225–227). Overall, DPP-4 inhibitors might be able to inhibit CAVD independent of glucose control with potential efficacy for deterioration of BAV.",
        "Over the last decade, the results of numerous large cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with diabetes at high cardiovascular risk with novel glucose-lowering medications, such as sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, have substantially offered more available medications, resulting in brand new evidence-based medical therapy for the management of this population (10). Based on the cardiovascular benefits independent of glucose control, SGLT-2 and GLP-1 receptor agonist inhibitors might be the promising medications with potential efficacy for CAVD or even deterioration of BAV. Thus, further experiments and large-scale clinical studies are essential for verification of the effects of glucose-lowering medications on deterioration of BAV.",
        "In recent years, the prevalence of diabetes has increased rapidly in patients with CAVD. Except for individual effects of diabetes (e.g., hyperglycemia, AGEs/RAGE pathway, oxidative stress, EndMT, and inflammation), there were multifactorial interactions between those diabetic complications (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CKD, ageing), which mutually took part in the initiation and development of CAVD. The prevalence of diabetes in patients undergoing TAVR or SAVR has also increased along with the progression of CAVD. However, clinical outcomes and postoperative complications in diabetes after TAVR or SAVR remained controversial. Compared with non-diabetes, the short-term mortality after TAVR was not significant in diabetes, while the mid-term mortality remained disputable. The mid-term and long-term mortality rates after SAVR were higher in patients with diabetes than non-diabetes, while the short-term mortality remained disputable. There were common worse manifestations with CAD, AKI, heart failure, and SIRS in diabetes undergoing TAVR or SAVR, compared with non-diabetes. The role of diabetes-related obesity paradox in TAVR or SAVR remains disputable. There is a need for RCT and large cohorts with long-term follow-up of diabetes vs. non-diabetes in patients undergoing TAVR or SAVR. Moreover, diabetes and its complications also jointly participated in the deterioration of BAV, leading to increased long-term mortality and various postoperative complications after TAVR or SAVR. Based on the efficacy for CAVD and BAV deterioration in vitro and vivo, PPARγ agonists might be the promising glucose-lowering medication to inhibit BAV deterioration independent of glucose control.",

Genetic constituents, high-fat and high-energy dietary habits, and a sedentary lifestyle are three major factors that contribute to high risk of T2D. Several studies have reported gut microbiome dysbiosis as a factor in rapid progression of insulin resistance in T2D that accounts for about 90% of all diabetes cases worldwide. The gut microbiome dysbiosis may reshape intestinal barrier functions and host metabolic and signaling pathways, which are directly or indirectly related to the insulin resistance in T2D. Thousands of the metabolites derived from microbes interact with the epithelial, hepatic and cardiac cell receptors that modulate host physiology. Xenobiotics including dietary components, antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs strongly affect the gut microbial composition and can promote dysbiosis. Any change in the gut microbiota can shift the host metabolism towards increased energy harvest during diabetes and obesity. However, the exact mechanisms behind the dynamics of gut microbes and their impact on host metabolism at the molecular level are yet to be deciphered. We reviewed the published literature for better understanding of the dynamics of gut microbiota, factors that potentially induce gut microbiome dysbiosis and their relation to the progression of T2D. Special emphasis was also given to understand the gut microbiome induced breaching of intestinal barriers and/or tight junctions and their relation to insulin resistance. New Delhi, 110067, India.

        "Obesity is now a leading public health issue worldwide (Blüher 2019). Globally, individuals of all economic statuses and ages are increasingly getting obese, a condition characterized by adverse levels of excess fat storage (James 2018). More than 650 million individuals were obese in 2016, and the incidence of obesity has almost doubled since 1975, as reported by Blüher (2019). This chronic health condition is a dominant cause of global morbidity and mortality because of the high rate of comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, cancer, and psychiatric diseases (Jaacks et al. 2019).",
        "Obesity is increasingly becoming prevalent in low‐ and middle‐income countries that are undergoing rapid dietary transitions and urbanization, as per global trends (Jaacks et al. 2019). The “obesity transition” refers to a shift from undernutrition to overnutrition due to excessive consumption of calorie‐dense foods with low nutrient value and physical inactivity. Systemic gaps in the prevention and management of obesity exist, according to Friedrich (2017), since the global burden of obesity continues to rise even with increased public awareness and advances in medicine. Adding to its complexity of management are the socio‐economic aspects of obesity (Huang et al. 2024). Obesity is gender and income level‐dependent, as discussed by Ameye and Swinnen (2019). The poorer parts of society tend to be more affected by the disease; subsequently, they have limited access to medical services and more healthy food. On the contrary, Seidell and Halberstadt (2015) debate that fighting obesity demands an integrated policy taking into account economic, cultural, and environmental features in addition to biological aspects.",
        "Acknowledgments to the latest advances in nutrition science, microbiology, and neurology, one of the key concepts to grasp obesity has appeared: the gut‐brain axis (GBA) (Zhu et al. 2022). The GBA is well‐defined by Berthoud et al. (2021) as the neuronal, endocrine, and immunological networks of paths participating in bidirectional communication among the CNS and gastrointestinal tract. The regulation of hunger, energy homeostasis, mood, and behavior states that are intensely associated with obesity's pathophysiology is attained by this axis. The gut microbiota, which is an assemblage of polymicrobial microbes found in the gastrointestinal system, is particularly concerned in the GBA. The bacteria modify the host physiology by altering neurochemical transmission, altering the immune response, and producing metabolites, as van Son et al. (2021) contend.",
        "Metabolic inefficiency, augmented intestinal permeability, and systemic inflammation are all pointers of dysbiosis, an imbalance of the gut microbiota composition, Torres‐Fuentes et al. (2017) declare. Moreover, nutritional and microbial signals can modulate the vagus nerve, a key messenger between the gut and brain. As noted by Longo et al. (2023), it transmits signals from the gut to areas of the brain that regulate hunger and mood. Significant is the vagus nerve and blood–brain barrier being affected by microbial metabolites such as bile acids, neurotransmitter precursors (e.g., tryptophan), and short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs) regarding satiety and mood (Song et al. 2022; Bliss and Whiteside 2018).",
        "The gut‐brain axis plays a role in obesity that extends beyond merely modulating metabolism; it also influences mental health. Obesity often accompanies mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, which are brought about by chronic inflammation and disrupted gut signaling (Agustí et al. 2018). Thus, the GBA offers a holistic model for exploring the interplay between obesity and mental well‐being. There is a close correlation between obesity and metabolic health, typically defined by factors such as insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, inflammatory markers, and blood glucose levels (Li, Li, et al. 2025). “Metabolically healthy obesity” was conceived because, much to the contrary, not all individuals who are overweight are metabolically unhealthy. The reality that such individuals still experience greater long‐term health threats, as noted by Gregg and Shaw (2017), suggests that surplus fat is an etiologic change driver in itself. When it comes to managing metabolic health, the gut microbiota reigns supreme. Metabolic disorders linked with obesity may be induced or prevented by alterations in the microbiome, which affect dietary energy extraction, insulin sensitivity, and systemic inflammation (Asadi et al. 2022).",
        "A microbiome profile associated with metabolic outcomes has been proposed by the finding that certain microbial taxa are more prevalent in individuals with obesity, while others are more prevalent in lean individuals (Forte et al. 2020). Metabolic dysregulation is self‐sustained by conditions including leptin and insulin resistance that are compounded by changes in the gut‐brain axis due to obesity, in turn influencing hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis (Wu et al. 2019). Another variable complicating the metabolic scenario is gut dysbiosis that results in low‐grade chronic inflammation, a widespread condition observed with obesity (Solas et al. 2017).",
        "The gut microbiota composition and function is essentially regulated by diet. Based on Barber et al. (2023) and García‐Montero et al. (2021), microbial diversity and anti‐inflammatory signatures are associated with nutrient‐dense, high‐fiber diets such as the Mediterranean diet, while Western diets rich in fats and sugars induce dysbiosis and systemic inflammation. Intestinal permeability alterations and neuroinflammatory mechanisms triggered by food can have effects on metabolic and mental health (Gan et al. 2024). Diet, gut microbiome, and mental health have all been correlated in a number of studies. An unhealthy diet, a lack of balance of gut microbes, and depression symptoms were all associated in one study (Taylor et al. 2020).",
        "Madison and Kiecolt‐Glaser (2019) propose that unhealthy diets fuel inflammatory responses and stress‐induced dysbiosis, both of which are bad for psychological health. Zhou and Foster (2015) expose that psychobiotics, or the amalgamation of prebiotics and probiotics, can efficiently treat mental circumstances by leveraging the microbiota‐gut‐brain axis. Such treatments serve to decrease depressive and anxiety symptoms through the establishment of a balance to microbes as well as boosted production of neuroactive chemicals such as serotonin and gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA). New studies designate that dietary interventions have potential for utility in obesity‐related mental health prevention as well as for the treatment of such disorders when combined with other therapies.",
        "Based on Merlo et al. (2024), the consequences of treatment in the metabolic and mental spaces might be enhanced using individualized diet plans considering each person's unique microbial profile. A multifaceted network of communication involving metabolic and neuropsychological events, the gut‐brain axis bridges the thin relationship between food patterns, obesity, gut flora, and mental well‐being. The prevention of the global obesity pandemic needs to be achieved by an interdisciplinary, multimodal approach due to the multiple determinants of excess calories among others. The advancement of holistic solutions to enhance metabolic well‐being and mental health in individuals affected by obesity rests on our capacity to comprehend how nutrition affects the GBA.",
        "With a focus on how eating habits influence gut microbiota, psychological well‐being, and metabolic well‐being, this review aims to integrate the current understanding of the gut‐brain axis and its role in obesity. Intricate interactions between food, gut bacteria composition, and cognitive factors render obesity a multifactorial disease. Increasing evidence indicates the disruption of metabolic and neurological pathways caused by gut dysbiosis as an etiology of weight gain, insulin resistance, and psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression. We contrast the impact of Western diets rich in processed foods, sweets, and saturated fats on gut microbial diversity and inflammation with Mediterranean or plant‐based diets high in fiber, polyphenols, and probiotics. We also examine how emotional eating and chronic stress are psychological factors contributing to obesity through modifying gut‐brain interaction.",
        "The molecular associations between metabolic illnesses, such as insulin resistance and T2D, and gut dysbiosis, are a significant area of research. Therapeutic diets that can influence metabolic and psychological outcomes, such as prebiotics, probiotics, and fiber‐rich nutrition, are examined. Individualized nutrition through microbiome profiling and integrative treatment models that combine dietary intervention, psychological treatment, and medical management are among the future directions covered in this paper. This review discusses the gut‐brain axis as a viable approach to obesity management by integrating the disciplines of psychology, microbiology, and nutrition science.",
        "Host health is most affected by changing dietary habits; meanwhile, these impact the composition and activity of the gut microbiota. While nutrients play a part in gut flora, dietary habits over time also play a role. Gut dysbiosis, characterized by reduced microbial diversity and elevated levels of pro‐inflammatory bacterial communities, has been linked to a diet ironic in saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, and ultra‐processed foods, as recent evidence suggests (Clemente‐Suárez et al. 2023; Shi 2019).",
        "As per Rizzello et al. (2019), the dysbiotic state is linked with a variety of chronic illnesses, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. Contrary to this, studies by Barber et al. (2023) and Merra et al. (2020) designate that a Mediterranean diet which is high in fruits, legumes, nuts, olive oil, and moderate wine intake can be supportive of microbial diversity in the gut and even beneficial. Individuals who adhere to this diet to the minute have an increased incidence of bacteria that are SCFA producers, as exposed by an investigation done by De Filippis et al. (2016) and Gundogdu and Nalbantoglu (2023).",
        "Both inflammation and metabolic well‐being are aided by SCFA‐producing bacteria. The diet of an individual can affect his or her immune system responses via the mediation of the interaction among his or her gut bacteria and diet. Two mechanisms whereby the Western diet impacts the immune system are raised systemic inflammation and compromised gut barrier integrity, according to García‐Montero et al. (2021). Contrariwise, foods in the Mediterranean diet have an impact on the microbiota. These foods prevent the immune system from getting out of control, and this decreases the risk of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (Nagpal et al. 2019; Picchianti Diamanti et al. 2020).",
        "The role of food habits for overall physiological well‐being as well as the balance of gut microbiota is underscored by this interface(Wang et al. 2025). The gut microbiota is recognized by Bremner et al. (2020) as a central mediator of the connection among diet, stress, and psychological health. The usage of microbiota‐friendly dietary practices, such as the Mediterranean diet, is one potential means to augment health and prevent disease via gut control.",
        "The contemporary Western diet has been interconnected with frequent adverse modifications of the gut microbial community in response to high saturated fat, refined carbohydrate, and fiber intake (Zeng et al. 2024). Such diets have been connected to metabolic and inflammatory disturbances by scientific studies, comprising reductions in microbial diversity and a rise in pro‐inflammatory microbial groups (Rizzello et al. 2019; García‐Montero et al. 2021).",
        "An upsurge in intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation can result in obesity, T2D, and cardiovascular disease (Shi 2019). Contrariwise, the Mediterranean diet, which is characterized by a heavy consumption of beans, nuts, vegetables, whole grains, and olive oil, is recognized to enhance intestinal health. This diet supports varied and balanced microbiota by promoting the dominance of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and decreasing the dominance of harmful pathogens, as found in studies (Merra et al. 2020; Barber et al. 2023).",
        "The fiber and polyphenol content in this diet supports microbial fermentation. This leads to the production of butyrate and other derivatives of saturated fatty acids. These short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are anti‐inflammatory in nature and function to uphold the intestinal barrier in integrity (Figure 1) (De Filippis et al. 2016). Metabolomics and metagenomics investigations have designated that the gut microbiota is affected by the Mediterranean diet in a manner that supports metabolic and immunological well‐being (Barber et al. 2021; Rinott et al. 2022). Figure 1 shows the western diets vs. Mediterranean diets on gut health.",
        "Western diets versus Mediterranean diets on gut health.",
        "The gut‐brain axis is linked to stress and emotional control; this has implications for mental health as well, as indicated by research (Bremner et al. 2020). Chicco et al. (2021) and Picchianti Diamanti et al. (2020) resolute that inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients had fewer symptoms when they stuck to the Mediterranean diet exactly. This suggests that the diet possesses anti‐inflammatory and microbiota‐modulating properties. Another element that safeguards against oxidative stress and chronic illness is the significant quantity of polyphenols, vitamins C and E, and other antioxidants consumed (Gantenbein and Kanaka‐Gantenbein 2021).",
        "Microbiota prejudiced by the Western diet is not just incomplete for the immune system. Dysbiosis associated with this diet, unlike the Mediterranean diet that improves immune control by changing the pattern of microbes, impedes immunological functions and promotes an inflammatory environment (García‐Montero et al. 2021). Intervention investigation has recognized that shifting from a Western diet to a Mediterranean diet substantially alters gut microbial patterns. What this suggests is that altering one's diet can improve one's microbiota and keep it healthy (Nagpal et al. 2019; Garcia‐Mantrana et al. 2018).",
        "The development of the gut microbiome is influenced by prebiotics, which are undigested food ingredients that aid in the growth of good bacteria. Certain dietary fibers like inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) might improve the production of SCFA and encourage microbial diversity, as stated by Xu et al. (2022).",
        "Short‐chain fatty acids like butyrate, acetate, and propionate enhance the intestinal barrier's function and possess systemic anti‐inflammatory properties. Beyond the prebiotic effect, probiotics directly enhance populations of useful microbes; these live microorganisms confer health benefits when administered in adequate ratios. Due to their roles in gut health improvement, regulation of immunological function, and prevention of GI infections, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are among the most investigated probiotics (Table 1) (He and Shi 2017; Liu et al. 2022).",
        "Comparative analysis of Western versus Mediterranean diets on gut health and microbiota modulation.",
        "The action of western and mediterranean diets on digestive health and modulation of microbiota is compared in Table 1. Synbiotics, being a blend of prebiotics and probiotics, can potentially enhance the function and composition of the microbiota more than either of these individually. Through the restoration of eubiosis and the strengthening of metabolic balance, these blends have shown promise in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (Delgado and Tamashiro 2018; Cerdó et al. 2019). Emphasizing the need for specific dietary approaches to change the microbiota for particular health results, recent research proposes categorizing fibers based on their prebiotic potential (Rezende et al. 2021).",
        "Precision nutrition therapies specific to an individual's personalized microbiome and health goals become possible through this approach. An equilibrated microbiota is associated with better metabolic and cardiovascular well‐being, a healthy gut, as well as other systemic compensations of a prebiotic, high‐fiber diet (Li, Zhang, et al. 2025). High fiber enhances insulin sensitivity and decreases LDL cholesterol through a microbial intermediate, based on studies referenced by Oniszczuk et al. (2021) as well as Rivera‐Piza and Lee (2020). Combining second‐generation probiotics, which involve bacterial strains established or naturally set to have augmented functional characteristics, with precise prebiotics could assist individuals suffering from extreme dysbiosis, as per investigation (Fei et al. 2023).",
        "Dietary fibers mark the endocrine and immune systems and ease microbial fermentation, among other activities. Thus, the physiology of the host, microbiota, and nutrition all appear to interrelate in complex manners (Kumar et al. 2020; Ye et al. 2022). Thus, endorsing the intake of fibers, prebiotics, and probiotics ingredients of healthy gut flora is one operative method for sustaining overall health. These consequences contribute to the expanding indication base representing how diet influences the microbiome and how the quality of food influences disease risk and health.",
        "Emotional eating and stress behaviors are two means through which psychological fundamentals are intricate in triggering and perpetuating obesity. According to various studies (Van Strien 2018; Devonport et al. 2019), individuals who consume food when sad, anxious, or stressed consume more calories and energy‐dense food. Individuals will consume comfort foods high in fat and sugar when stressed to a high level; for instance, during the COVID‐19 pandemic (Cheng and Wong 2021; Shen et al. 2020).",
        "Individuals who struggle with managing their emotions or are psychologically vulnerable are likely to resort to this unhealthy coping strategy even more frequently because they do not know how to manage their emotions in a healthy manner (Figure 2) (Frayn et al. 2018; Trigueros et al. 2020). Obesity and mental disorders such as anxiety and depression have a high correlation with each other. Obese individuals tend to experience mood disorders, and individuals who experience anxiety or depression tend to gain weight, which is partly brought about by emotional eating and inactivity (Fulton et al. 2022; Dakanalis et al. 2023). Figure 2 shows the psychological factors in obesity.",
        "Psychological factors in obesity.",
        "Weight management may be further addressed through the vicious cycle that can be perpetuated by the intricate relationship between psychological discomfort, obesity, and mental health issues (Table 2) (Konttinen 2020; Sharafi et al. 2020). The inclusion of psychological support in the prevention and treatment of obesity programs is essential, as these results identify the importance of mental health in achieving long‐term weight loss objectives. Emotional eating, stress, and mental health connections are a few of the psychological aspects leading to obesity, as indicated in Table 2.",
        "The impact of psychological factors on obesity: Emotional eating, stress, and mental health associations.",
        "Emotional eating and other poor eating habits may be caused by stress, a strong psychological factor that influences dietary habits. When individuals succumb to their emotions instead of their physical hunger, they are emotionally eating (Van Strien 2018). This involves consuming large amounts of calorically dense and palatable food. The stress hormone cortisol increases blood glucose, which in turn elevates hunger and the need for high‐calorie, short‐term comfort foods (Figure 3) (Ulrich‐Lai et al. 2015). Figure 3 shows the stress, anxiety, depression, and their impact on dietary choices.",
        "Stress, anxiety, depression and their impact on dietary choices.",
        "A cycle of overeating and stress can form when stressors are long‐lasting and constant. Fears generated by the COVID‐19 pandemic could have led to emotional eating and unhealthy food choices among college students (Cheng and Wong 2021). Similarly, Shen et al. (2020) highlighted the point that how individuals view stress has an influence on their food motivation, with many resorting to comfort food in order to cope. Such eating is strongly related to means of coping with and comforting oneself when emotionally upset; it is not merely about indulging. As per various studies, emotional eating is one of the primary reasons behind people's unhealthy eating habits, particularly those who have abdominal fat.",
        "As per Betancourt‐Núñez et al. (2022), overweight individuals in the abdominal area had greater emotional eating scores and their eating patterns were characterized by excessive sugar and fat consumption. That there is a two‐way interaction between one's mental health and his eating habits is proven here. The inability to properly cope with stress has also been linked with emotional eating. Individuals lacking stress management ability are more likely to indulge in bad eating habits, which are likely to result in obesity and heart conditions in the long term (Errisuriz et al. 2016).",
        "Unhealthy eating appears to be motivated, in significant part, by stressed individuals' inability to manage their emotional reactions in ways that bear little relation to food. Based on a systematic review conducted by Devonport et al. (2019), normal‐weight and overweight individuals also suffer from emotional eating, yet based on weight status, the triggers and consequences of this action differ. Overweight persons are more likely to feel guilty, which contributes to stress eating. Aside from worsening mental health and body image concerns, this emotional response can trigger subsequent illustrations of emotional eating. The amount to which these behaviors are organized is significantly affected by emotional intelligence (EI).",
        "Students' resilience, test anxiety, and compliance with the Mediterranean diet were all positively related to EI, as per a study by Trigueros et al. (2020), which indicates that EI can act as a buffer against eating due to stress. Interferences designed to improve emotional regulation can demonstrate to be a valuable resource in the battle against eating disorders. Personality can influence eating habits when stressed. Investigators Keller and Siegrist exposed that persons who are higher in neuroticism and low in conscientiousness will eat incompetently and indulge in their feelings when hungry (Keller and Siegrist 2015).",
        "Persons with such traits are more likely to use food as a crutch throughout times of stress. Further, social and cultural determinants impact the way the bodies of people respond to stress via food. Emotional eating was predominant in young Saudi women during the outbreak (Al‐Musharaf 2020). The same was associated with lifestyle adjustments, disturbance of routine, and increased psychological discomfort. Drawing from these results, it is evident that therapies need to be population‐based with consideration of respective cultural food settings and stresses facing each group. Lastly, there is a robust association between emotional eating and stress, which influences food options in a way that often leads to better health threats and lower quality diet. Stress management, emotional aptitude, and personality characteristics should be the primary areas of successful rehabilitation to help individuals create more enduring eating habits when they feel emotionally upset.",
        "There is increasing indication that obesity is made worse by mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, which in turn affect mental health. Emotional eating has been recognized by Frayn et al. (2018) and Van Strien (2018) as a critical factor in the intricate interconnection between mood disorders and weight gain. When individuals with depression or anxiety experience variations in appetite, reduced exercise, and sleep problems, it can result in an imbalance of their energy levels and fat accumulation (Konttinen 2020).",
        "New‐fangled studies have exposed the chemical and neurological mechanisms behind this relationship. Fulton et al. (2022) noted that mood disorder and obesity relate to disruption in neuroendocrine function, that is, hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and sustained low‐grade inflammation. Such biochemical changes favoring insulin resistance and fat accumulation form the substrates for metabolic diseases. There are real concerns regarding young people's risk. Lindberg et al. (2020) discovered that, in comparison to their normal‐weight peers, obese children are significantly more likely to indicate feeling anxious and sad.",
        "Wang et al. (2019) validated this, noting that Chinese children who were overweight had a higher incidence of mood issues, suggesting a potential link between early‐onset obesity and emotional health. The psychological cost of being obese can exacerbate symptoms of depression, rendering it a vicious cycle. Depression, obesity, and emotional eating are interconnected in young adults, says Lazarevich et al. (2016). Body dissatisfaction and social stigma increase the moods of these individuals, rendering emotional eating a highly probable maladaptive strategy. Several studies have indicated that the health burden is amplified when anxiety, depression, and obesity coexist. Obese individuals who are also depressed or anxious are more likely to consume medical services and pay more for such services, as indicated by Nigatu et al. (2017). This identifies the importance of treatment modalities that coordinate mental and physical health.",
        "One interesting connection between obesity and mental health disorders is emotional eating. Most of the relationship between depressive symptom severity and obesity in adolescents was explained by emotional eating, as found by Fox et al. (2016). This indicates the significance of preventing and treating obesity among mentally vulnerable individuals through programs that emphasize control over emotions, especially for children; the environment at home matters. As reported by Kanellopoulou et al. (2022), parental status of mental health, eating styles, and childrearing styles have a significant relationship with children's weight and depression. Thus, therapies addressing families can possibly address both issues simultaneously. When occurring together in adults, depression and obesity have a debilitating impact on their quality of life. The quality of life with respect to health in individuals with both diseases was significantly worse than in individuals with one of these conditions only, as seen from research conducted by Nigatu et al. (2016).",
        "The relevance of diagnosing and treating co‐existing mental illness in patients with obesity is emphasized by this double burden. A biopsychosocial strategy involving medications that inhibit neuroendocrine and inflammatory cascades, psychotherapy, nutrition therapy, and stress management has been suggested by Ouakinin et al. (2018) to confront this interlocked epidemic. Public health policies encompassing these initiatives may enhance the prevention and management of obesity among vulnerable groups of mental illness risk.",
        "There is a close link between the composition and role of the gut microbiota, T2D, and metabolic well‐being. T2D is characterized by insulin resistance, and research has associated gut dysbiosis disruption—of populations of microbes with—the condition (Sharma and Tripathi 2019). By changing the gut microbiota conformation, gram‐negative bacteria may release lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the blood, which can disrupt the intestinal barrier (Di Lorenzo et al. 2019). According to Chen et al. (2021) and Sircana et al. (2018), this may cause chronic inflammation, which in turn constrains insulin signaling. Furthermore, dysbiotic changes enhance beta‐cell injury and glucose intolerance by triggering oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. As distinguished by Tangvarasittichai (2015) and Petrick et al. (2020), this further supports the metabolic abnormalities in T2D.",
        "Apart from factors associated with the digestive system, lifestyle habits and diet also have significant roles in upholding metabolic health. Based on studies (Wen and Duffy 2017; Zhang et al. 2021), a healthy fat, fiber, and antioxidant‐rich diet, such as the Mediterranean diet, can induce an enhanced gut microbiota composition, which in turn augments insulin sensitivity and glycemic control. Wang, Lu, et al. (2020) exposed that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and other interferences reverse insulin resistance, showing the therapeutic value of targeting the gut microbiota. The results of this study designate that augmenting gut health using dietary and microbiological interventions may be a means to prevent or manage T2D.",
        "A vital defense mechanism, the intestinal barrier prevents bacteria and their products, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), from crossing into the bloodstream (Ghosh et al. 2020). It consists of epithelial cells, mucus, and tight junction proteins and is crucial to keeping the gut in‐house (Capaldo et al. 2017). Metabolic endotoxemia and low‐grade inflammation are linked with obesity, resulting in insulin resistance and systemic inflammation as a result of enhanced intestinal permeability, referred to at times as “leaky gut” (Ghosh et al. 2020). The mucus layer is the first line of defense against infections, comprised of mucins secreted by goblet cells (Vancamelbeke and Vermeire 2017).",
        "Obesity aggravates metabolic derangement because of the modification of tight junction proteins, which control paracellular permeability (Sánchez de Medina et al. 2014). There is evidence that a diet rich in saturated fats and refined carbohydrates could impact the expression of tight junction proteins and reduce mucus thickness, both reducing the integrity of the intestinal barrier (Lopetuso et al. 2015). As described by Shu et al. (2023), psychological disorders and neuroinflammation may be caused through the gut‐brain axis by bacterial LPS entering circulation, triggering toll‐like receptors (TLRs), and initiating pro‐inflammatory cytokine production. Conversely, fiber‐rich dietary interventions can enhance barrier function through enhanced mucus secretion and tight junction integrity through the production of short‐chain fatty acids (SCFA) (Capaldo et al. 2017). It is, thus, important to understand the integrity of the intestinal barrier in order to realize the two‐way relationship between metabolic and psychological well‐being in obesity.",
        "The human gut microbiota controls host metabolism, immunological functions, and inflammation; it is closely linked to the pathophysiology of T2D (Yin et al. 2025). Recent scientific debates have focused on dysbiosis, a disruption in the balance of gut bacteria, as a potential etiology for insulin resistance (Sharma and Tripathi 2019). Alterations in microbial diversity, particularly decreases in symbiotic bacteria such as \nAkkermansia muciniphila\n, have been associated with compromised gut barrier function and elevated systemic inflammation (Chen et al. 2021).",
        "Inflammatory variations often impair insulin signaling pathways. Increased lipopolysaccharides (LPS), cell wall components of gram‐negative bacteria, have been correlated with dysbiosis, and metabolic endotoxemia has been revealed to induce insulin resistance (Salguero et al. 2019). Further proof of the connotation of dysbiosis with T2D was exposed using experiments on mouse models that had beforehand received translocation of gut microbiota from diabetic individuals (Liaqat et al. 2021). Additionally, oxidative stress has been found to be linked with gut dysbiosis, which further endorses insulin resistance and beta‐cell dysfunction (Tangvarasittichai 2015).",
        "A feedback loop is established by this oxidative environment, which further disrupts the microbiome and sustains metabolic dysfunctions. These explanations propose a possible physiological connection among microbial composition and insulin resistance. The gut‐liver axis, or interaction among the two organs, is another etiological factor for this disease. Irrespective of body mass and insulin resistance, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that frequently comes with T2D has been linked with dysbiosis, that is, a systemic implication of increased microbial variation (Da Silva et al. 2018; Tanase et al. 2020).",
        "Recent clinical studies in human subjects suggest control of gut microbiota to be highly impactful for clinical trials. For instance, Wang, Yang, et al. (2020) report that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from lean donors may reverse the insulin resistance and islet function of patients with metabolic syndrome. However, the safety and efficacy of such treatments over the long term remain to be investigated. Combined, the evidence demonstrates that gut dysbiosis is a cause of T2D, not only a symptom of it. It is important to maintain the health of the gut environment because shifts in microbes may influence glucose metabolism (Sikalidis and Maykish 2020).",
        "Dietary therapies have emerged as non‐pharmacological interventions to improve metabolic and psychological outcomes, considering the relationship between gut microbiota and T2D. Dietary factors significantly impact the gut microbiota, and these, in turn, influence the diversity of microbes, the immune system's functioning, and inflammatory processes (Zhang et al. 2021; Wen and Duffy 2017). There is robust evidence that the high‐fiber, polyphenolic, and omega‐3‐rich Mediterranean diet benefits insulin resistance, mood, and cognitive function.",
        "Parletta et al. (2019) and Jacka et al. (2017) reported that such a dietary lifestyle enhanced metabolic regulation and psychological well‐being by raising gut microbial richness and lowering pro‐inflammatory taxa. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that whole‐diet therapies, rather than individual nutrient supplementation, are most effective in reducing depressive symptoms and glycemic improvement (Opie et al. 2015; Firth et al. 2019).",
        "Oriach et al. (2016) discovered that the microbiome mediates changes in mental health that are related to nutrition. These benefits are likely due to synergistic effects on the gut‐brain axis. Diet may be therapeutic for mental illness, as suggested by the growing field of nutritional psychiatry that often co‐exists with metabolic disorders. Based on new research, there is promise that plant and anti‐inflammatory diets can reduce the mood and metabolic impairments of overweight individuals (Medawar et al. 2019; Adan et al. 2019). Wholistic improvement may also be had through mindfulness‐based eating habits. These interventions enhance physical and mental health by lowering stress and changing dietary habits (Table 3) (Rogers et al. 2017).",
        "The role of gut dysbiosis in metabolic dysfunction and potential dietary interventions.",
        "Overweight or obese individuals with metabolic syndrome or T2D can benefit significantly from them. Table 3 presents data on the potential dietary interventions and the role of gut dysbiosis in metabolic dysfunction. Both eating patterns and the makeup of one's microbiota affect one's mental well‐being. A cycle of viciousness can be sustained when individuals with depression and anxiety alter their diets, resulting in increased consumption of unhealthy foods and poorer metabolic dysfunction (Bremner et al. 2020).",
        "In type 2 diabetics, the optimal outcomes might be achieved with the combination of dietary modification and psychological counseling directed to the axis microbiota‐gut‐brain (Marx et al. 2017, 2021). A personalized diet based on the individual composition of every subject's microbiota and his psychological status is the following step in metabolic treatment. Lastly, in the interest of both metabolic well‐being and mental toughness, nutritional therapies are essential. T2D, as well as associated mental distress, might be optimally managed through attention to gut health through diet.",
        "Diet, gut microbiota, and metabolic and psychiatric complications of obesity are all linked by the gut‐brain axis. Fiber‐rich diets and the Mediterranean diet promote mental health and microbial diversity, but Western diets worsen gut dysbiosis, inflammation, and insulin resistance. There is a vicious cycle in the etiology of obesity in which psychological disturbances, including stress and depression, make poor dietary choices even worse. Metabolic well‐being and psychological functioning can be enhanced by dietary treatments aimed at gut flora, such as prebiotics and probiotics. An effective approach to the treatment of obesity has to be multidisciplinary in outlook, encompassing food habits, gut health, and mental well‐being. In a bid to break the vicious cycle of emotional eating and metabolic impairment, the evidence suggests that nutritional treatments have to be coupled with psychosocial treatments. The long‐term effects of diet on the gut microbiota and mental health of obese individuals should be the focus of future research.",
        "The application of gut microbiota profiling to guide individualized dietary advice is a promising new frontier in the battle against obesity. New findings on the microbiome can help unlock personalized dietary advice that supports metabolic well‐being through microbe balance. In addition, precision nutrition methodologies may be enhanced through the integration of microbiome analysis with artificial intelligence. Treatment for obesity can make a sea change if interdisciplinary teams collaborate to enhance patients' physical health, mental health, and diets. Clinical trials need to investigate synbiotics (probiotics with prebiotics) and psychobiotics (psychiatric interventions that act on the microbiota) to validate their effectiveness. With a view to reducing the metabolic and psychological aspects of the global pandemic of obesity, public health promotion campaigns promoting gut‐friendly diets could be effective. New biomarkers for the early prediction of obesity risk may be discovered through increased research into the gut‐brain axis, permitting proactive treatments. Evidence‐based, holistic treatment protocols for obesity will need cooperation between physicians, psychologists, and nutritionists.",

However, despite causing impressive weight loss, GLP-1 receptor agonists do not normalise insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, and the long-term effects of this class of antidiabetic medication on muscle mass, frailty, and bone density have been poorly studied. Although GLP-1 receptor agonists improve insulin sensitivity secondary to weight loss, the only true direct insulin-sensitising drugs are thiazolidinediones. Because of side-effects associated with type 2 diabetes therapy, these drugs have not gained widespread use. In lieu of the important role of insulin resistance in the cause of type 2 diabetes and in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes, development of potent insulin-sensitising drugs that can be used in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists remains a large unmet need in the management of individuals with type 2 diabetes. for text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. defronzo@uthscsa.edu.

      "abstract": "Background This study aimed to examine the association between branched-chain amino acids/branched-chain α-keto acids (BCAAs/BCKAs) and adipose tissue insulin resistance (Adipo-IR) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods A total of 506 patients with T2DM were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were categorized into two groups based on Adipo-IR levels (non-Adipo-IR: Adipo-IR<7.68; Adipo-IR: Adipo-IR ≥ 7.68). Serum BCAA/BCKA concentrations were measured using ELISA kits. Correlations between BCAAs/BCKAs and Adipo-IR or HOMA-IR were evaluated using Spearman correlation analysis. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the associations of BCKAs with both indices of insulin resistance. Results Median serum BCKA levels were significantly higher in the Adipo-IR group than in the non-Adipo-IR (128.27 vs. 121.16, p < 0.001), while there was no significant difference in median serum BCAA levels between the two groups (2.54 vs. 2.52, p = 0.714). BCKAs were positively correlated with both Adipo-IR and HOMA-IR (both p < 0.01), and the association with Adipo-IR was stronger. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that BCKAs were associated with Adipo-IR regardless of adjustment for influencing factors, with increasing odds ratios across BCKAs quartiles (p for trend < 0.01). However, after adjusting for covariates, the association between BCKAs and HOMA-IR was no longer significant. Conclusions Serum BCKA levels were elevated in T2DM patients with Adipo-IR and were more strongly correlated with Adipo-IR than HOMA-IR. BCKAs may serve as sensitive biomarkers for Adipo-IR. Consequently, we would promote their clinical usage in the early screening of individuals with obesity, insulin resistance and a high risk of T2DM.",

        "Insulin resistance (IR) is characterized by a reduced sensitivity of insulin target organs and impaired regulation of carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism. It is strongly linked to the development of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity and cardiovascular diseases [1–3]. Among the major insulin-responsive tissues, adipose tissue plays a central role in glucose and lipid metabolism [4–6]. Dysregulation of adipose tissue function often results in insulin resistance. While hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp and multistep pancreatic clamp techniques have been used to access adipose tissue IR, these methods are expensive, labor-intensive, and impractical for large-scale use [7, 8]. Recently, the adipose tissue insulin resistance (Adipo-IR) index, calculated as fasting plasma insulin (FINS) multiplied by fasting plasma free fatty acid (FFA), has emerged as a reliable and accessible surrogate marker for adipose tissue IR [9–12]. Previous studies have shown that Adipo-IR were correlated with dysglycemia and increased progressively with the development of T2DM [13, 14].",
        "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), comprising valine, leucine, and isoleucine, are essential nutrients for humans. BCAAs are metabolized into branched-chain α-ketoacids (BCKAs) through the action of BCAA transaminase [15]. Studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of BCAAs and BCKAs are associated with metabolic disorders, including T2DM, obesity and metabolic syndrome [16–21].In particular, increased plasma BCKAs have been proposed as superior biomarkers for diabetes compared to BCAAs [17, 22]. Considering the established link between elevated BCAAs/BCKAs and metabolic diseases, as well as the critical role of adipose tissue insulin resistance in these conditions, we hypothesized that adipose tissue may also play a significant role in the catabolic pathways related to BCAAs. However, the relationship between BCAAs/BCKAs and Adipo-IR in T2DM remains unclear. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the association between serum BCAAs/BCKAs and Adipo-IR in patients diagnosed with T2DM. By elucidating the relationship of BCAAs/ BCKAs and Adipo-IR, our research aimed to facilitate their application for the early detection of patients with metabolic disorders as well as provide novel strategies to reduce the risk of adipose tissue insulin resistance.",

        "Several important conclusions could be drawn from this study. First, among patients with T2DM, circulating BCKAs levels were significantly higher in patients with Adipo-IR compared to those without Adipo-IR. Second, Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed that BCKAs, rather than BCAAs, were positively associated with both Adipo-IR and HOMA-IR in T2DM patients. Third, BCKAs showed a stronger correlation with Adipo-IR compared to HOMA-IR, as demonstrated by multivariable regression analysis.",
        "Adipo-IR is increasingly recognized as a simple and reliable plasma index for assessing adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. While Adipo-IR was highly correlated with HOMA-IR, which was commonly used to assess systemic IR [28–30], there were notable differences between HOMA-IR and Adipo-IR. Studies have shown that Adipo-IR may be served as an earlier biomarker for metabolic disorders compared to HOMA-IR [31–33]. For instance, Adipo-IR has been found to have a stronger association with the development of prediabetes than HOMA-IR [34], highlighting the unique role of adipose tissue in glucose dysregulation. In contrast, HOMA-IR has been more closely linked to systemic metabolic changes, such as a decrease in basal metabolic rate [31]. These distinctions underscored the specific metabolic roles of adipose tissue in diseases like T2DM.",
        "The role of BCAA catabolism and its connection to IR in patients with obesity and T2DM have been studied for decades. However, there was limited evidence linking BCAA metabolism to IR in specific tissues, particularly adipose tissue. Recent studies have begun to emphasize the importance of adipose tissue in BCAA catabolism [35, 36]. For example, Ma et al. [36] demonstrated that knocking out the Bcat2 gene in adipose tissue, especially in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), could prevent obesity induced by a high-fat diet in mice. Disruption of BCAA catabolism in adipose tissue promoted the browning of iWAT, while supplementation with BCKAs reversed this browning effect. In our study, we found that serum BCKAs levels were significantly higher in T2DM patients with Adipo-IR than those without Adipo-IR. These findings collectively suggested that adipose tissue plays a critical role in the regulation of BCAA catabolism.",
        "BCKAs, including α-ketoisocaproate (α-KIC, derived from leucine), α-keto-β-methylvalerate (α-KMV, derived from isoleucine) and α-ketoisovalerate (α-KIV, derived from valine), are products of the first step in the catabolism of BCAAs via branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT) [37]. BCKAs play a critical role in metabolic disorders such as obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and T2DM [22, 38, 39]. Elevated levels of circulating BCKAs have been implicated not only as biomarkers but also as potential causative factors of IR and other cardiometabolic disorders [40–42]. In a study by Grenier-Larouche et al. [39], BCKAs were shown to be more reliable markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH in subjects with severe obesity compared to BCAAs. Our study supported these findings by demonstrating a positive correlation between BCKAs and both HOMA-IR and Adipo-IR in T2DM patients.",
        "Interestingly, recent studies in adults have suggested that elevated serum BCKAs were more closely associated with insulin resistance and were better predictors of T2DM development compared to BCAAs [40]. Similarly, the isoleucine metabolite α-KMV was identified as a strong predictor of impaired fasting glucose in a large cohort study from TwinsUK [43, 44]. Our study aligns with these findings, as we also observed a positive association between BCKAs and Adipo-IR in patients with T2DM. Moreover, BCKAs rather than BCAAs were found to be an independent influencing factor for Adipo-IR in this population. A potential explanation for elevated BCKAs in T2DM patients with Adipo-IR may be related to decreased activity of branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) in adipose tissue. This enzyme is responsible for the second step in BCAA metabolism: the oxidative decarboxylation of BCKAs. A reduction in BCKD activity could lead to an accumulation of BCKAs, ultimately resulting in elevated serum levels of BCKAs and a stronger association with adipose tissue insulin resistance [45].",
        "One of the key strengths of our study was that it was among the first to investigate the specific association between BCKAs and Adipo-IR in patients with T2DM. Our findings indicated a stronger correlation between BCKAs and Adipo-IR compared to HOMA-IR, reinforcing the critical role that adipose tissue plays in BCAAs metabolism. This suggested that BCKAs may serve as more sensitive indicators of IR in adipose tissue. Additionally, the upward trend in Adipo-IR across BCKA quartiles, as opposed to BCAA quartiles, further supported the hypothesis that BCKAs were more strongly linked to adipose tissue dysfunction.",
        "However, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the cross-sectional design restricted our ability to establish causality between elevated BCKAs and Adipo-IR. Future longitudinal studies are necessary to confirm the temporal relationship between elevated BCKAs and the development or progression of Adipo-IR, which will provide deeper insights into the potential causal role of BCKAs in IR and related metabolic disorders. Second, the relatively small sample size may limit the generalizability of the results. Future studies with larger, multi-center cohorts are needed to validate these findings. Finally, we measured total serum total BCKAs but did not analyze the relationship between individual BCKA levels and Adipo-IR. Future research could focus on distinguishing the specific contributions of each BCKA to adipose tissue dysfunction.",
        "This study demonstrated that serum BCKA levels were significantly elevated in T2DM patients with Adipo-IR compared to those without Adipo-IR. Additionally, BCKAs showed a stronger correlation with Adipo-IR than with HOMA-IR, suggesting that BCKAs may serve as sensitive biomarkers for adipose tissue IR. These findings emphasize the critical role of adipose tissue in BCAA metabolism and its involvement in metabolic dysfunction in T2DM.",
        "Clinically, BCKAs have the potential to be used as biomarkers to identify individuals at greater risk of adipose tissue insulin resistance, offering opportunities for earlier intervention in managing metabolic disorders in T2DM.",

It is the most common disorder of pancreatic cell function that causes insulin deficiency. Sulfonylurea is a class of oral hypoglycemic drugs. Over the past half century, these drugs, together with the subsequent non-sulfonylureas (glinides), have been the main oral drugs for insulin secretion.

METHODS: The mechanism, characteristics, efficacy and side effects of sulfonylureas and glinides were reviewed in detail. RESULTS: Sulfonylureas and glinides not only stimulated the release of insulin from pancreatic cells, but also had many extrapanular hypoglycemic effect, such as reducing the clearance rate of insulin in liver, reducing the secretion of glucagon, and enhancing the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: Sulfonylureas and glinides are effective first-line drugs for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.

        "Myocardial infarction (MI), caused by\nacute coronary artery occlusion,\nremains the predominant contributor to global cardiovascular mortality.\n,\n This ischemic insult triggers irreversible cardiomyocyte necrosis\ndue to oxygen and nutrient deprivation, while the heart’s minimal\nregenerative capacity exacerbates tissue loss. The ensuing pathological cascade, characterized by inflammatory\ninfiltration, fibroblast activation, and extracellular matrix deposition,\ndrives maladaptive ventricular remodeling and fibrotic scar formation,\nprogressively impairing cardiac output. Central to this process is ischemia-reperfusion injury, where abrupt\nblood flow restoration paradoxically amplifies oxidative stress via\nmitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction,\nfurther accelerating cardiomyocyte apoptosis.\n,\n The\nunderlying pathophysiology centers on acute ischemia-induced oxygen\nand nutrient deprivation, which promotes cardiomyocyte death through\nexacerbated oxidative stress.\n−\n\n To date, no effective drug therapy\nexists for myocardial infarction (MI), making revascularization procedures\nthe first-line treatment.

        "Emerging evidence underscores\nthe critical involvement of pyroptosis,\na lytic, inflammatory form of programmed cell death, in aggravating\nmyocardial injury after MI.\n−\n\n Unlike apoptosis, pyroptosis\nis partially mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to cell membrane\nperforation and robust pro-inflammatory responses.\n,\n In the ischemic myocardium, the pyroptotic cascade is initiated\nthrough hypoxia-induced HIF-1α upregulation, which synergizes\nwith endogenous ROS to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in cardiomyocytes. Upon activation, NLRP3 facilitates the cleavage\nof pro-caspase-1 into active caspase-1, which in turn processes gasdermin\nD (GSDMD) and pro-IL-1β into their mature forms.\n,\n The N-terminal fragment of GSDMD (GSDMD-N) oligomerizes to form\nplasma membrane pores, enabling the release of intracellular damage-associated\nmolecular patterns (DAMPs) and mature IL-1β, thereby amplifying\nlocal inflammation and cardiomyocyte death. This self-perpetuating cycle of pyroptosis and inflammation worsens\ncardiac remodeling and contributes to post-MI heart failure.",
        "Sulfonylurea drugs, particularly the clinically\napproved antidiabetic\nagent glibenclamide (INN), have demonstrated NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitory\nactivity, offering potential for repurposing in myocardial protection.\n,\n Mechanistically, glibenclamide binds to ATP-sensitive potassium\nchannels (K-ATP) to reduce ATP-induced NLRP3 activation, suppressing\ninflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1/GSDMD-N-mediated pyroptosis. However, effective NLRP3 inhibition often requires\nsupratherapeutic doses, increasing risks of severe hypoglycemia due\nto its primary insulinotropic action. Despite this limitation, as\na proof-of-concept therapeutic, glibenclamide has the potential to\nbe a NLRP3-targeted drug for cardiovascular applications. Concurrently, adequate oxygen supply is essential\nfor restoring cardiac function, and combinatorial oxygen therapy may\nsynergistically improve myocardial recovery.",

        "To clarify the stability of MIA, we measured the\nparticle size\ndistribution of MIA under different conditions. The results showed\nthat MIA can be stable for 3 days without significant changes in particle\nsize, and the solution after 3 days is still a relatively uniform\nliquid (Figure \nf).\nThat is, MIA exhibited exceptional stability and maintained its integrity\nin various solvent environments. The responsiveness of MIA to acid\nand H2O2 was then evaluated. Upon exposure to\nH2O2, MIA exhibited a significant decrease in\nabsorbance below 450 nm, indicating the reactivity of surface MnO2 with H2O2. Notably, the addition of\nH2O2 resulted in a substantial increase in the\nabsorbance of INN in solution, confirming the drug release capability\nof MIA in response to H2O2 (Figure \ng).

        "Furthermore, we established that MIA effectively releases its drug\npayload only when it encounters a weakly acidic environment in conjunction\nwith the presence of H2O2 (Figure \ni). During the release of the\ndrug INN, MnO2 can always catalyze the reaction of H2O2 to generate O2. Therefore, we used\nan oxygen electrode to measure the level of O2 in the solution.\nThe results showed that MIA can slowly produce O2 in the\npresence of H2O2.

MIA exhibited a notable inhibitory\neffect on Caspase-1 cleavage, ultimately leading to a significant\nreduction in the expression of IL-1β (Figure \nb, d, and f). IL-1β is a prominent\nmarker of pyroptosis and inflammation. The decreased IL-1β expression\nsuggests that MIA suppresses the activation of the pyroptosis cascade,\nfurther supporting its efficacy in pyroptosis inhibition. Perhaps\none of the most compelling pieces of evidence lies in the significant\nreversal of GSDMD-N expression after MIA treatment (Figure \nc, d, g, h, and Figure S3). GSDMD-N is responsible for forming\nthe membrane pore complexes that lead to the characteristic cell swelling\nand membrane perforation seen in pyroptosis. The increased level of\nGSDMD-N expression under AMI conditions was effectively reversed by\nMIA treatment, indicating its capacity to attenuate the formation\nof membrane pores (Figure S4).",
        "The\ntranscriptome data of mouse hearts after drug administration\nwere used to further clarify the changes in the transcriptional level\nof the mouse hearts after MIA administration. It is clear that after\nMIA administration, the transduction of pyroptosis-related signaling\npathways in mice can be alleviated, the expression of IL-17-related\npro-inflammatory signaling pathways can be reduced, and the expression\nof the nuclear transcription factor HIF-1α can be reduced (Figures S13–S16). At the same time, we\nalso conducted experiments on the H9C2 cell line, and the results\nshowed that MIA can effectively alleviate myocardial hypoxia and reduce\nNLRP3 inflammasome activation. (Figure S2). The consistency of cellular pathways at the cellular and animal\nlevels clarifies the possibility of myocardial repair after myocardial\ninfarction.",
        "The efficacy of MIA in\nrestoring heart function was confirmed through animal experiments,\nas illustrated in Figure \na. In this study, animals were categorized into five groups:\nSham, AMI, MnO2@Alb, INN@Alb, and MnO2@INN@Alb.\nAfter intravenous administration, the drug was mainly distributed\nin the livers of mice. As time went on, the distribution of INN in\nthe heart tissue of mice gradually increased, reaching the highest\ndrug concentration at 12 h (Figure S11).\nAfter 30 days of treatment, comprehensive evaluations were conducted\nincluding echocardiography and histological assessments. Echocardiography\nresults (Figure \nb,\nc, and Figure S5) demonstrated that MIA\nsignificantly improved heart function. Specifically, MIA effectively\nrestored key parameters such as the ejection fraction (EF) and fractional\nshortening (FS). Additionally, MIA had a notable impact on reducing\nthe left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESd). Although MIA did\nnot exhibit a significant effect on left ventricular end-diastolic\ndiameter (LVEDd), the overall improvement in these parameters indicates\nthe positive impact of MIA on heart function (Figure \nd–g).",

        "To further investigate whether MIA had a remodeling\neffect on cardiac\nfunction, histological (H&E) staining was performed on the hearts\npost-MIA treatment. These analyses revealed that MIA effectively restored\nthe shape and function of the left ventricle (Figure \na). MIA treatment notably reduced the area\nof cardiac apoptotic regions and the levels of inflammatory cell infiltration.\nThese findings were further corroborated by TUNEL staining results,\nwhich demonstrated that MIA significantly reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis\nand the extent of apoptotic areas (Figure \nb, Figure S6).\nHeart sections were stained for Cx43, a critical protein involved\nin electrical coupling and cell-to-cell communication in cardiac tissue.\nThe results illustrated that MIA treatment promoted the expression\nof connexin Cx43 (Figure \nc, Figure S7). Simultaneously,\nMIA significantly inhibited the expression levels of wheat germ agglutinin\n(EGA, green fluorescence in Figure \nc), indicating that MIA can indeed enhance cardiac\nfunction and restore pathological damage.",

        "Myocardial\ninfarction (MI) often results in a cascade of detrimental events including\ncardiomyocyte apoptosis and the formation of significant fibrosis\nin the necrotic region of the heart. To ascertain MIA’s potential\nto effectively reverse fibrosis while addressing cardiomyocyte hypoxia\nand inhibiting pyroptosis, comprehensive pathological assessments\nwere performed. Using Sirius red staining, we observed that MIA significantly\nreduced the levels of fibrosis in the cardiac tissue (Figure \na, d). Furthermore, Masson\nstaining was conducted on heart sections, confirming MIA’s\nability to decrease fibrosis and the accumulation of collagen fibers\n(Figure \nb, e). Collagen\nimmunofluorescence staining on cardiac sections further demonstrated\na significant reduction in cardiac type I collagen levels following\nMIA administration (Figure \nc, f, and Figure S8).",

        "Collectively, these findings illustrate that MIA\ncan effectively\nreverse cardiomyocyte hypoxia, inhibit pyroptosis, reduce cardiomyocyte\napoptosis, and importantly mitigate the occurrence of fibrosis. This\ncomprehensive approach contributes to the improvement of cardiac function\nand the recovery of myocardial tissue following a MI. MIA’s\nability to address multiple aspects of post-MI pathology makes it\na promising candidate for the treatment of this condition and underscores\nits potential to enhance cardiac performance and overall patient outcomes.",
        "The use of MIA in\nthe treatment of myocardial infarction in rats not only effectively\nimproved their cardiac function but also showed no signs of obvious\ntoxicity and immune cell infiltration in the myocardium, as observed\nin H&E sections. Building upon these findings, the study proceeded\nto evaluate the in vivo safety of MIA, providing further evidence\nof its biocompatibility and safety. Following intravenous injection\nof MIA, there were no significant changes observed in the main organs\nof the rat, including the brain, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys\n(Figure S9). This lack of observable organ\ntoxicity underscores the biocompatibility of MIA.",
        "Moreover,\nall biochemical blood indicators remained within the normal range\n(Figure \na–f).\nThese results confirm that, at the studied dose, MIA did not induce\nsevere systemic toxicity in the experimental animals. Furthermore,\nMIA does not induce a rapid decrease in blood sugar after administration,\nand there is no risk of hypoglycemia after administration (Figure S10). This is a critical finding, as it\nsuggests that MIA holds potential for safe and effective use in clinical\nsettings, where patient safety is of utmost importance. These results\nprovide a solid foundation for further exploration of MIA as a therapeutic\nstrategy for myocardial infarction.",

        "Our study demonstrates that the MIA nanoparticle\nprovides a synergistic\ndual-mechanism therapy for myocardial infarction by simultaneously\naddressing two critical pathological processes. First, the MnO2 component catalytically converts accumulated H2O2 into oxygen, effectively mitigating cardiomyocyte hypoxia. Second, the incorporated INN potently inhibits\nNLRP3 inflammasome activation, thereby suppressing oxidative-stress-induced\npyroptosis in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. This coordinated intervention\nnot only restores cardiomyocyte function but also significantly reduces\nboth acute tissue damage (76% decrease in infarct size) and subsequent\nfibrotic remodeling (90% reduction in collagen deposition). The complementary\nactions of oxygen supplementation and pyroptosis inhibition establish\nMIA as a promising therapeutic platform for comprehensive post-AMI\ncardiac repair.",
        "Post-MI oxygen delivery, while critical for\ncardiomyocyte salvage,\nfaces inherent limitations.\n,\n Endogenous oxygen supply\nremains insufficient to meet metabolic demands in infarcted regions,\noften yielding subtherapeutic tissue pO2 (<30 mmHg)\ndue to the local H2O2 level and rapid oxygen\ndiffusion.\n,\n Moreover, conventional oxygen\ncarriers (e.g., perfluorocarbons) suffer from short half-lives and\npoor spatial control, risking systemic oxidative stress. While our MnO2-based approach generates\nlocalized oxygen, the duration remains constrained by H2O2 substrate depletion. To overcome these challenges,\nexosome encapsulation offers a transformative strategy, with enhanced\ntarget specificity, prolonged circulation time and decreased payloads\ndegradation. This biohybrid system could\nsynergize oxygen supplementation with pyroptosis inhibition, further\naddressing both supply and stability bottlenecks for comprehensive\nMI therapy.",
        "Research establishes that myocardial hypoxia drives\nexcessive ROS\naccumulation, inducing oxidative damage that culminates in cardiomyocyte\napoptosis/necrosis. Notably, hypoxia and ROS also activate NLRP3-mediated\npyroptosisa key contributor to infarct expansion. While oxygen\nsupplementation remains fundamental to break this vicious cycle, our\nstudy demonstrates that combining it with pyroptosis inhibition yields\nsuperior outcomes. Although glibenclamide shows antipyroptotic effects\nat high doses, we engineered an albumin-emulsified INN formulation\n(INN@Alb) that achieves comparable NLRP3 suppression through enhanced\nsolubility. Intravenous MnO2@INN@Alb administration not\nonly reduced pyroptosis markers, but also improved cardiac function,\nconfirming target engagement. This dual-axis strategy, oxygenation\nto mitigate hypoxia/ROS and targeted inflammasome inhibition, synergistically\noffers a paradigm shift from monotherapeutic approaches.",
        "In\nsummary, our study presents an innovative nanoparticle, MIA,\nwith triple-action capabilities that are responsive to acidity, oxygen-generating,\nand capable of reversing pyroptosis. This nanoparticle primarily consists\nof an INN shell and an MnO2 shell. MnO2 catalyzes\nH2O2 in the infarcted region to generate oxygen\nand effectively targets the infarct area due to its inherent acid-responsive\ncharacteristics. Furthermore, INN encapsulation within the particle\neffectively reverses pyroptosis in cardiomyocytes postinfarction.\nOverall, MIA represents a promising avenue for improving existing\nmyocardial infarction treatments and may provide a novel therapeutic\napproach for patients with acute myocardial infarction in the near\nfuture.",

        "The MSC-treated group had a significantly lower HbA1c at the last follow-up compared to the baseline (MD: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.57, P-value: 0.003< 0.05), their insulin requirement was significantly lower (MD: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.31, P-value: 0.002< 0.05), the level of FBG with MSC transplantation significantly dropped compared to baseline (MD: 1.78, 95% CI: -1.02 to 4.58, P-value: 0.212), the FPG level of the MSC-treated group was significantly lower (MD: -0.77, 95% CI: -2.36 to 0.81, P-value: 0.339 > 0.05), and the fasting C-peptide level of the MSC-treated group was slightly high (MD: -0.02, 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.02, P-value: 0.231 > 0.05).",
        "The transplantation of MSCs has been found to positively impact both types of diabetes mellitus without signs of apparent adverse effects.",
        "Diabetes is a serious and growing health problem worldwide. This is a persistent health condition that arises when the body is incapable of adequately controlling the levels of glucose in the bloodstream. Each year, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) rises. According to the International Diabetes Federation, approximately 4.51 million adults across the globe were diagnosed with diabetes in 2017. Furthermore, it is expected that this figure will escalate to 6.93 million by the year 2045 (1). Diabetes holds two types which vary in their mode of action on the human body. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an immune system infection, and insusceptible assaults result in the obliteration of islet cells, causing islet aggravation related to outright insulin lack. Eventually, several related complications arise, compromising the patient’s quality of life and reducing their durability (2). Around 90% of adults with diabetes are diagnosed with the most common form of diabetes, known as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (3). The leading causes of diabetes are the malfunctioning of islet cells and the body’s reduced sensitivity to insulin (4).",
        "High blood glucose levels in individuals with diabetes are managed through a combination of insulin injections, daily oral hypoglycemic agents, exercise, and diet. However, while these conventional therapeutic approaches aim to regulate insulin levels, they may not always be effective in doing so, which can result in severe hypoglycemia and poor adherence to treatment plans. In fact, only 14% of patients with diabetes in the United States meet the glucose, lipid, and blood pressure control and quitting smoking targets. Despite significant research efforts devoted to understanding the disease process and the experimental therapeutics of diabetes, there is still an urgent need for more effective treatments to prevent or manage this severe metabolic illness (5).",
        "Stem cell-based transplantation has emerged as a promising strategy for treating diabetes in recent years, which offers numerous benefits. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), unlike embryonic stem cells, are not associated with tumorigenic risks or ethical concerns when treating diabetes (6–8). Due to its ease of access and wide availability, MSC transplantation is an appealing option (9); it has low immunogenicity, the ability to self-renew, the potential for multi-differentiation, the secretion of various cytokines, and other biological characteristics. It does not raise any ethical issues (10–12).",
        "In the past decade, MSCs have demonstrated their therapeutic potential in both clinical and preclinical studies for the treatment of diabetes. In vitro studies have proposed that MSCs are capable to self-renew and differentiate into multiple mesenchymal lineages such as adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages. Furthermore, they have low immunogenicity due to the interstitial expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and the lack of MHC class II. MSCs release cytokines, growth factors, and exosomes, which modulate insulin sensitivity and β-cell dysfunction. Earlier studies have recommended that MSCs have the capability to exert antidiabetic effects because several dose administrations of MSCs may help improve hyperglycemia in DM patients.",
        "Recent experimental explorations shed light on the complex mechanisms that highlight the therapeutic effects of MSCs in diabetes management. In STZ diabetic animal models, β-cell dysfunction can be caused by pancreatic microenvironment inflammation. The MSC treatment has been validated to facilitate the proliferation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and incorporate long-term immunomodulatory effects. The secretion of cytokines such as Th2 secreted by Tregs and interleukins (IL-10 and IL-3) pose an anti-inflammatory profile which supports pancreatic β-cell regeneration and function (13).",
        "In addition, MSCs exhibit a response toward inflammatory stimuli by shifting macrophages from pro-inflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes. This is promoted by an overexpression of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1). MSCs may alleviate the systemic inflammation by downregulating the inflammatory cytokines, reducing insulin receptor action, and secreting IL-1Ra in response to IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) signals from diabetic islets. This reaction reduces the synthesis of NLRP3 production in adipose tissue and liver. These findings highlight MSCs’ complex immunomodulatory characteristics and potential as a therapeutic method for controlling type 2 diabetes and its consequences. Conclusively, MSC infusion has been utilized to treat diabetes by reconstructing β cells, enhancing and regulating glucose homeostasis, alleviation of insulin resistance, and lowering/regulating systemic inflammation (14).",
        "The therapeutic potential of bone marrow-obtained mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation in treating T2DM was demonstrated for the first time in a 2009 study conducted by Bhansali et al. (15). The study involved 10 T2DM patients and showed that BM-MSC transplantation developed a significant decline in insulin requirement and improvement in stimulated C-peptide levels. Several subsequent studies have been carried out to validate the safety and effectiveness of using BM-MSCs and placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PD-MSCs) in treating T2DM. These investigations have confirmed the initial results reported in (15) and have provided further evidence of the therapeutic potential of BM-MSCs and PD-MSCs for treating T2DM (16).",
        "A recent investigation demonstrated that patients with T2DM experienced a decrease in HbA1c levels and insulin dose at the 6-month mark following treatment and after receiving a combination of intravenous and intrapancreatic endovascular injection of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) with a 5-day interval. The study also discovered that 41% of the patients became insulin independent, and 29% had 50% or greater reduction in insulin requirement. Nonetheless, these positive outcomes were not sustained over the next 3–6 months as the HbA1c levels and insulin dose reverted to their pre-treatment levels (17).",
        "Multipotent stem cells have been utilized in the treatment of different autoimmune-related disorders, with some commercial products resulting from these treatments (18–21). However, the assessment of the safety and effectiveness of stem cell transplantation for DM is still in its preliminary stages. Clinical trials involving MSCs and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in patients with T1DM have been carried out since 2000 (22–25), yet there is still no strong consensus on their efficacy. To date, no research has been carried out to compare the effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in treating type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) despite earlier studies demonstrating the efficacy of MSCs in both forms of diabetes. Furthermore, a number of studies have been published in the context of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. They examined the impact of stem cell therapy (SCT) on diabetes mellitus, but the absence of several critical components in each of these investigations has led to differences in their findings and has resulted in them being inadequate in providing a complete understanding of previous interventional studies.",
        "Recently, Madani et al. (26) compared the efficacy of MSCs and HSCs in a meta-analysis of SCT research in T1DM. The search period for this paper was limited to September 2019, and it does not include both types of DM to compare the effectiveness of MSCs and HSCs simultaneously. Similarly, a meta-analysis (27) was carried out in 2021 to predict the safety and efficacy profile of transplanting mesenchymal stem cells for treating T1DM and T2DM. However, this meta-analysis did not include four papers (28–31) as their search window was limited to November 2011 to November 2020. The reason of not including these studies is not mentioned. Our meta-analysis includes the recent clinical trial conducted by Zang et al. (32), which involved testing UC-MSCs on Chinese adults with T2DM. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the distinct therapeutic effects of MSCs on diabetes mellitus and its subtypes as well as their safety to lay a speculative foundation for medical assessment and diabetes therapeutic interventions based on trials conducted until November 2023. The outcomes of this research could have the potential to guide in the design of future clinical trials investigating the effectiveness and safety of MSC therapy for DM as well as provide evidence to support the development of clinical guidelines for the use of this therapy.",
        "The studies were included on the following criteria: (1) research studies published in Chinese and English, (2) clinical studies/trials involving MSCs as a treatment regimen for DM, (3) MSCs were used to treat diabetes in all patients, regardless of age, race, sex, extent of disease, or geographical location, and (4) all findings evaluated the treatment of diabetes with MSCs. There were no restrictions on the time, duration, or dosing frequency of MSCs used in the treatments. The treatment’s control group is either placebo or absolutely nothing. The treatment duration and dosage for the placebo was the same as for the MSC group. Finally, these are (5) studies with multiple follow-up timeframes, ranging from 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12 months, which was consistent with the majority of the studies analyzed.",

        "The study looked at two types of outcomes:",
        "1. Primary outcomes: These were variations in insulin requirements, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and C-peptide between baseline and after therapy (3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up).",

        "This analysis utilized mean difference (MD) to compare continuous variables between baseline and follow-ups. MD was selected to compare continuous variables because of its simplicity, interpretability, and compatibility with meta-analysis techniques, representing the absolute difference in means between treatment groups, quantifying the magnitude of difference, and providing a straightforward measure of treatment effect. It is suitable for synthesizing data from diverse studies, focusing on comparing means rather than specific statistical assumptions, and allows to estimate the overall effect. We considered P-value less than 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) as statistically significant. We calculated the heterogeneity of the included studies using the I2 statistic, where values of 25%, 50%, and 75%–100% indicated low, medium, and high heterogeneity, respectively. In instances where significant heterogeneity was detected (I2 > 50% and P< 0.10), we used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis (39). Otherwise, the data were evaluated using a fixed-effects model.",
        "These models offer the flexibility to incorporate prior information and estimate heterogeneity more comprehensively. The decision to utilize fixed-effects or random-effects models in our meta-analysis was indeed based on the observed level of heterogeneity among the included studies. While fixed-effects models assume a common treatment effect across all studies, random-effects models account for both within-study and between-study variability, acknowledging potential differences in treatment effects. Moreover, in case of higher heterogeneity, the Knapp and Hartung adjustment was also applied. This adjustment accounts for potential variability in effect sizes across studies and provides more conservative estimates of the overall effect. We also performed sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of results by testing the impact of different assumptions, models, or inclusion criteria, thus ensuring the reliability and validity of conclusions amidst varying methodological choices and potential biases. The externally standardized residuals, DFFITS values, Cook’s distances, covariances ratios, leave-one-out Tau estimates, Hat values, and weights were plotted. This allows for a comprehensive assessment of the data and helps identify influential data points or outliers. This approach enhances the transparency and reliability of the analysis. In this meta-analysis, we compared the treatment group, i.e., MSCs and the control group (if any) from the selected studies using Jamovi version 2.3 (40), and the results were depicted by forest plots (Tables 2–6). We assessed the heterogeneity and publication bias using several methods, including the Q Cochrane test and I2 statistic, the Cochrane ROB tool, meta-regression analysis, and examination of publication bias using funnel plots, and Begg’s and Egger’s regression tests.",

Some trials, however, were unable to collect enough clinical data, such as body mass, blood pressure, liver and renal function tests, and fasting plasma insulin. The eligible studies involved four types of MSCs: including BM-MSCs, Wharton’s jelly-derived (WJ-MSCs), and UC-MSCs, with various cell doses used. The intervention regimen involved administering MSCs via intravenous or intra-arterial delivery, with doses ranging from (0.88 ± 0.05) × 106 to (1.2 ± 0.3) × 109. The follow-up period varied from =3 to 12 months. Of the eligible studies, six reported data on MSCs and T1DM (28–31, 33–35), and seven reported data on MSCs and T2DM (15–17, 32, 36–38).",

        "Cochran’s Q-test and I2 statistic were applied to measure the heterogeneity of the true outcome of the following parameters: HbA1c, insulin requirement, fasting blood glucose, fasting plasma glucose, and C-peptide with 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. According to the Q-test, the true outcomes had appeared to be heterogeneous significantly for HbA1c with 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up as (Q-test: 12.547, P-value: 0.049< 0.05, tau-square: 0.1184, I2: 58.33%), (Q-test: 58.590, P-value< 0.001, tau-square: 0.0233, I2: 84.84%), (Q-test: 41.073, P-value< 0.001, tau-square: 3.2342, I2: 96.73%), and (Q-test: 25.908, P-value< 0.001, tau-square: 0.3551, I2: 87.33%), respectively (shown in Table 2). Similar results for other parameters can be found in Tables 2–6. The random-effect model was implemented for significance of heterogeneous true outcomes.",

The empirical estimation of publication bias was indicated as non-significant bias at 5% level of significance for HbA1c in all 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up as (Begg and Mazumdar test, P-value: 0.733 > 0.05 and Egger’s regression P-value: 0.568 > 0.05), (Begg and Mazumdar test, P-value: 0.156 > 0.05 and Egger’s regression P-value: 0.091 > 0.05), (Begg and Mazumdar test, P-value: 0.333 > 0.05 and Egger’s regression P-value: 0.007< 0.05), and (Begg and Mazumdar test, P-value: 0.233 > 0.05 and Egger’s regression P-value: 0.001< 0.05), respectively. Similar results for publication bias about the parameters insulin requirement, FPG, FBG, and C-peptide can be found in Tables 3–6.",
        "In the present meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of key methodological decisions on the synthesized effect estimates and associated uncertainty measures. Specifically, we explored the effects of alternative statistical models (e.g., fixed-effects vs. random-effects models), inclusion/exclusion of studies based on specific criteria (e.g., sample size, study quality), and variations in data synthesis techniques. Through this rigorous examination, we aimed to ascertain the robustness of our findings against potential sources of bias and heterogeneity inherent in meta-analytic research. By identifying influential studies, assessing the sensitivity of results to methodological assumptions, and exploring the consistency of conclusions across different analytical approaches, the sensitivity analysis provides valuable insights into the reliability and generalizability of our study findings.",
        "Multiple methods including the externally standardized residuals, DFFITS values, Cook’s distances, covariances ratios, leave-one-out tau estimates, Hat values, and weights were applied and examined in instances that their residuals of fasting plasma glucose fall out of the control limits (Figure 7) due to a previously conducted study (37). After excluding this study, a similar approach was iteratively repeated and excluded (15) to minimize the potential risk of bias. The revised results for FPG are shown in Table 5.

        "To clearly differentiate between potential complications caused by the intervention, the fundamental complications of T1DM and insulin therapy must be identified. Compliance to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, including randomization and the inclusion of a control group, is recommended to facilitate this. However, the majority of clinical trials investigating stem cell transplantation for the treatment of T1DM have been of poor quality, with many lacking a control group or randomization to allow for comparisons of outcomes and adverse events. Consequently, there have been conflicting judgments regarding the side effects of stem cell therapy in these trials. Hypoglycemia was excluded from consideration as an adverse event, as it can happen due to insulin therapy and autoimmune disorders of the thyroid in individuals with T1DM without any intervention.",
        "Minor hypoglycemic episodes were mentioned in three studies (15, 37, 38), but these episodes were not classified as severe. Nausea and vomiting were mentioned in three studies, with (38) not specifying the number of patients affected, while (15) and (30) reported one patient each. Bhansali et al. (15) also reported hemorrhage at the injection puncture site in one patient, a drop in hemoglobin level in two patients, and a self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection in one patient. Mild fever was reported in three out of 22 T2DM patients by Liu et al. (17). There were no serious or persistent adverse reactions or legacy effects observed during the follow-up timespan, indicating that MSCs are reasonably safe in the treatment of DM.",
        "This meta-analysis provides quick insights about MSC transplantation along with their statistical significance (P-value< 0.05) and was associated with improvements in both T1DM and T2DM. The absence of observed adverse effects in the patients suggests that MSC transplantation may be a safe and promising approach to improve glucose metabolism in individuals with T1DM and T2DM. The data confirms the use of MSC transplantation as an effectual diabetes treatment. The significant reduction in fasting blood glucose, plasma blood glucose, and HbA1c levels at baseline suggests that MSC therapy can improve blood glucose regulation in diabetic patients. The use of FBG and PBG as diabetes diagnostic criteria, as well as HbA1c levels as a measure of diabetes control, supports the conclusion that MSC transplantation has a therapeutic effect on blood glucose regulation in DM patients.",
        "The meta-analysis results indicate a slight but non-significant rise in fasting C-peptide levels in the group that received MSC transplantation (P-value > 0.05). The escalation in F-CP level decreased as the duration of follow-up increased. This increase in F-CP indicates an improvement in insulin secretion by the pancreatic islet cells, implying that MSC transplantation has a beneficial effect on insulin secretion. The elevated insulin secretion could be due to either a rise in the number of insulin-secreting cells or an improved performance in the function of the remaining β cells. These findings suggest that MSC transplantation has potential as a treatment for diabetes, but further research with longer follow-up periods is necessary to fully comprehend the underlying mechanisms and ensure its long-term safety and effectiveness.",
        "Our findings revealed a substantial reduction in insulin demands following MSC therapy in patients with diabetes, which was consistent across all included studies with follow-up periods of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. This decrease in insulin requirements was found to be statistically significant (P-value< 0.05). The observed efficacy of MSC therapy in reducing insulin requirements was retained at the end of most follow-up intervals. However, further studies with prolonged follow-up time points and complete data must confirm these findings. The cessation of insulin treatment is a crucial component in enhancing the overall quality of life of individuals with diabetes. In some studies, it was regarded as the primary outcome. A total of three patients in (34), three in (36), two in (28), six in (37), and five in (32) experienced an insulin-free period.",
        "The findings of the meta-analysis indicate a potential improvement in the efficacy of stem cell transplantation for diabetes treatment from 3 to 12 months after transplantation. However, some of the trends were not statistically significant. The results suggest that the MSC transplantation group experienced improvement from 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up periods. However, to ensure the safety and efficacy profiles of SCT for diabetes treatment, long-term follow-up studies are necessary. Thus, there is a need to conduct more studies with extended follow-up periods to obtain a better understanding of the effects of SCT on diabetes. Moreover, further studies that will emphasize on clarifying the different follow-up phases or describing the primary outcomes related to the impact of SCT on diabetes morbidity and mortality are recommended.",
        "According to the analysis, MSCs have been demonstrated as a secure option for stem cell transplantation in diabetes mellitus. The short-term findings indicated that MSCs could help enhance blood glucose regulation; however, additional research is necessary to assess their long-term impacts. Across the 13 studies, no significant adverse reactions or occurrences of hypoglycemic events were detected in subjects who received MSCs treatment. This suggests that MSC transplantation can be regarded as a safe treatment option for DM.",
        "The performance of MSC transplantation in the treatment of diabetes mellitus was analyzed in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The study searched numerous databases and trial registries from their establishment until February 2023. The study utilized a consensus approach to settle disputes, neutral supervision for data extraction, inclusion and exclusion criteria, top-notch impact illustration of original research studies findings on meta-analysis results, and confidence intervals for cumulative facts. Regardless of these advantages, the study had flaws, such as insufficient well-designed clinical trials with control groups, randomization, and blinding. Most of the SCT clinical trials in DM were single arm, leading to inconclusive results. Therefore, standardization and uniformity in the production, culture, and administration of MSCs in clinical trials are needed. In addition, the long-term safety and efficacy of MSC-based therapies have yet to be established, and larger sample sizes, more extended follow-up periods, and well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the benefits and risks of these treatments. It is also suggested that expressing daily insulin levels in units/kg/day instead of just customary units can provide a more standardized and comparable measure of the treatment’s effect. Furthermore, presenting findings in numeric form, rather than just figures, can increase the clarity and comprehensiveness of the results. In conclusion, while MSC transplantation shows promise in treating T1DM and T2DM, further research is necessary to fully understand its safety and efficacy and establish best practices for its use in clinical trials. Furthermore, limitations exist due to the lack of individual-level data required for subgroup analysis, such as age, gender, sickness status, and duration of disease history. The decision of selecting confounding factors was contingent upon data availability. The selection of confounding factors for inclusion in the study was determined subjectively, acknowledging inherent limitations. Complete elimination of potential interference from other factors was not feasible. Therefore, future research endeavors should encompass a broader scope, incorporating additional articles to further elucidate the collective impact of multiple factors on diabetes mellitus. Additionally, constraints in implementing alternative statistical methods such as t-tests, ANOVA, or regression analysis due to the lack of original research data and distribution details of variables pose challenges. However, the inability to conduct detailed subgroup analyses and the reliance on summarized data may limit the depth of insights and generalizability of findings.",

        "Over 90% of diabetes is classified into two main types being Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM. T1DM is defined as an autoimmune disease, resulting in insulin deficiency. T2DM is a metabolic disease caused by acquired endocrine disorders. T2DM is the underlying cause of many complications, among which, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are mainly responsible for the high rates of morbidity and mortality. Atherosclerotic CVD manifest as heart attacks and strokes, is responsible for up to 85 per cent of cardiovascular deaths 1. Atherosclerosis emerges as the “invisible killer” lurking in the cardiovascular system. With the gradual progression of atherosclerotic plaques, atherosclerosis will induce angina pectoris, or cerebral ischemia, leading to severe clinical manifestations such as heart failure, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral infarction and lower limb ischemia and amputation 2.",
        "Multi-country, multi-center long-term cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) confirmed that GLP-1RAs decrease cardiovascular mortality and provide cardiovascular benefits to reduce the incidence of MI or non-fatal stroke 3. For example, in the LEADER trial, when compared with placebo, liraglutide decreased the incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACE) by 13%, cardiovascular death by 22% and all-cause death by 15% among T2DM patients with CVD, on a standard treatment basis 4. In addition, liraglutide provided multiple additional benefits by reducing the incidence of hypoglycemia, lowering HbA1c and functioning through multiple mechanisms to better control multiple causes of MACE, such as blood lipids, BP as well as body weight (BW).",
        "GLP-1 is a gut-derived insulin agonist with the ability to suppress glucagon release and stimulate insulin secretion through targeting α-cells and β-cells, respectively 5. Likewise, GLP-1RAs can lower postprandial glycemia predominantly by slowing gastric emptying and promoting weight loss 6, 7. GLP-1RAs may improve endothelial cell function via anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory properties. Also, anti-proliferative effects on smooth muscle cells and anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages may contribute to the protection against the development and progression of atherosclerosis 8-10. In consideration of the dual roles of GLP-1RAs in hypoglycemic effects and preventing CVD among T2DM patients, we reviewed the cardiovascular effects and molecular mechanisms of GLP-1RAs in CVOTs, animal models and cultured cells, and discuss how these findings transform pharmacotherapies for T2DM, and even expand the indication of this important category of anti-diabetic drugs to CVD patients without diabetes.",
        "GLP-1RAs, consist of short-acting and long-acting agents. Short-acting drugs include exenatide twice daily, lixisenatide once daily and oral semaglutide once daily, while long-acting drugs include liraglutide, semaglutide, exenatide, albiglutide and dulaglutide all being administered once weekly. The primary pharmacodynamic distinctions between long-acting and short-acting GLP-1RAs are that long-acting agonists augment insulin production and suppress glucagon generation to lower postprandial glucose and fasting plasma glucose, while short-acting agonists chiefly lower postprandial glucose by delaying gastric emptying. Long-acting GLP-1RAs also have other benefits including improved gastrointestinal tolerability, moderate plasma drug concentration fluctuations, and more convenient dosage regimens which may improve medication adherence and treatment outcomes 11 (Table 1).",
        "Exendin-4 was originally found in the saliva of the venomous lizards whose synthetic version is exenatide. Exendin-4 inhibits the remodeling in the remote myocardium of rats following acute MI by attenuating β-catenin activation and activating glycogen synthase kinase-3, β-arrestin-2 and protein phosphatase 2A 12. In addition, exendin-4 protects against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats by enhancing antioxidant levels and inhibiting c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/p66 Shc/NADPH oxidase axis 13. GLP-1RAs, such as lixisenatide, not only rely on β-cell function and glucagon suppression, but also assist to lower glucose by other (insulin-independent) mechanisms such as delayed gastric emptying, underlying the clinical utility of GLP-1RAs as adjuvant therapy to basal insulin in longstanding T2DM 14. Further, liraglutide protects against vascular oxidative stress via attenuating eNOS (endothelial NO synthase) s-glutathionylation (a hallmark of eNOS uncoupling) and increasing NO bioavailability 15.",
        "The GLP-1 analogs, semaglutide and liraglutide, delay the progression of atherosclerosis by regulating inflammatory pathways in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (LDLr-/-) and apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice 16. Oral semaglutide reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP), BW and blood glucose levels. Nevertheless, it is associated with increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions 17. Exenatide ameliorates intramyocellular lipid deposition through improving insulin sensitivity and activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway without BW reduction 18. Compared with twice-daily exenatide, dulaglutide treatment reduces glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to a greater extent 19. Taspoglutide prevents apoptosis in vitro, promotes β-cell proliferation, and exerts multiple protective effects of β-cell in Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats 20. Compared with both placebo and liraglutide at 26 weeks, orally bioavailable semaglutide is superior in reducing BW and non-inferior to liraglutide concerning for decreasing HbA1c 21.",
        "Based on the above pharmacological characteristics of categories of GLP-1RAs agents, despite slight adverse gastrointestinal side effects, it is clear that GLP-1RAs agents have efficacy in cardiovascular protection without untoward hypoglycemia.",
        "In the past decade, CVOTs with GLP-1RAs have been conducted with at least seven agents including liraglutide, lixisenatide, exenatide, semaglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide and oral semaglutide (Table 2). In CVOTs, liraglutide, semaglutide and dulaglutide demonstrated appreciable cardiovascular and renal protective effects, among which liraglutide had an appreciable effect on mitigating the risk of cardiovascular death 4, while semaglutide and dulaglutide conferred a risk reduction on non-fatal stroke 22, 23. Moreover, liraglutide also had effects on reducing the incidence of MI in high-risk patients for T2DM, and may improve the clinical outcomes of MI 24.",
        "To date, the REWIND study has demonstrated for the first time that primary cardiovascular prevention strategies can significantly reduce cardiovascular adverse events in patients with T2DM, regardless of whether or not these patients are co-diagnosed with CVD 23. In this regard, dulaglutide is an ideal hypoglycemic drug for patients with T2DM due to its reported utility in primary prevention and secondary prevention. By February 21, 2020, dodecaplatin® (dulaglutide) is the first and only FDA-approved anti-diabetic drug for primary and secondary prevention to alleviate the risk of MACE 25.",
        "All five long-acting GLP-1RAs can reduce glucose levels and BW 4, 22, 23, 26, 27. In SUSTAIN 3, SUSTAIN 7 and SUSTAIN 10, the GLP-1RAs semaglutide reduced HbA1c by up to 1.8%, achieved the glycemic control target of HbA1c in 80% of the intervention group, and reduced BW by up to 6.5 kg, outcomes which were superior to liraglutide, exenatide and dulaglutide 28-30. In the LEAD-5 trial, liraglutide (1.8 mg once daily) reduced HbA1c more than insulin glargine during the treatment period (26 weeks) 31. The results of AWARD-CHN2 showed that the reduction of FPG by dulaglutide was similar to insulin glargine. In addition, post-prandial blood glucose reduction by dulaglutide was superior to insulin glargine. In addition to this, dulaglutide can greatly stabilize and decrease blood glucose levels 32.",
        "The levels of HbA1c, dyslipidemia, BW and BP are several of the risk factors for the progression of atherosclerosis and CVD in patients with T2DM. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that most of GLP-1RAs improve these parameters and thus attenuate the development and progression of atherosclerosis, especially concerning low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels 33. In 2015, a randomized controlled trial showed that taspoglutide can reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglycerides 34. Among new-onset patients with diabetes receiving standard statin therapy, liraglutide together with metformin improved lipid distribution of LDL and C-reactive protein (CRP) in atherosclerosis 35. Studies have also reported that under the conditions of comparable glycemic control, liraglutide (1.2 mg/d) alone was more effective than liraglutide with metformin or metformin alone on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular protection 36.",
        "In the LEAD series of studies, clinical data demonstrated that treatment with liraglutide for 26 weeks can reduce SBP 4. Exenatide improved the BP and blood lipid level of T2DM patients for 7 consecutive years in a DURATION open-extension study 37. In the REWIND study and AWARD5 study, dulaglutide consistently improved BP and lipid levels in patients 23, 38. Mechanistically, GLP-1 can lower BP through a diuretic mechanism, and other effects on the kidneys 39, 40. At another level, GLP-1RAs also improve systemic insulin sensitivity to lower arterial hypertension in T2DM by decreasing the concentration of angiotensin II (Ang II) 41, 42.",
        "There are two main trials (FIGHT and LIVE trials) demonstrating that treatment with liraglutide increased the risk of adverse heart failure-associated outcomes in patients with heart failure and reduced LVEF 43-45. In the LIVE trial, liraglutide treatment resulted in no change in left ventricular systolic function, whereas liraglutide related to an increase in heart rate and more serious cardiac adverse events among chronic heart failure patients with and without type 2 diabetes 45. While in a FIGHT trial, liraglutide reduced HbA1c levels (-0.48; 95% CI -0.92, -0.04; P = 0.033) and triglyceride levels compared with placebo (-33.1 mg/dL; 95% CI -60.7, -5.6; P = 0.019), together with a substantial weight reduction (-4.10 lbs; 95% CI -7.94, -0.25; P = 0.0367) 44. Curiously, LEADER revealed a downward trend in hospitalization rates for heart failure (-13%, P = 0.14) 4.",
        "CKD is clinically characterized by a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria for diabetic nephropathy, which is determined by the pathological changes in the structure and function in the kidney of patients with T2DM. Several recent CVOTs have shown that GLP-1RAs can reduce the decline of estimated GFR (eGFR) and delay the onset of the occurrence of proteinuria in patients with T2DM 4, 22, 26, 46, 47.",
        "In the ELIXA trial, lixisenatide ameliorated macroalbuminuria assessed as a decline in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. An analysis of the ELIXA trial data indicated that short-term GLP-1RAs may also have renal protective effects, analogous to long-acting GLP-1RAs 47. Analysis of the LEADER trial data demonstrated that liraglutide exerted a 22% decline in the morbidity of newly diagnosed or aggravated nephropathy 4. While in SUSTAIN-6, a sharper decline (46%) in macroalbuminuria seems to be entirely due to the semaglutide treatment than a 26% fall in macroalbuminuria by liraglutide 22. The AWARD-7 trial, which was the first clinical trial among moderate-to-severe CKD and T2DM displayed convincing protective effects on eGFR after treatment with GLP-1RAs 46. In addition, the analysis of the EXSCEL trial revealed that a composite end-point of new macroalbuminuria, 40% eGFR decline or renal death was reduced by the addition of exenatide in T2DM 26.",
        "To summarize several meta-analyses of CVOTs conducted with GLP-1RAs, it isconfirmed that based on 43 trials, GLP-1RAs are a class of efficacious agent for reducing MACE (MH-OR 0.87 [0.83, 0.92]), cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (MH-OR 0.89 [0.83, 0.96]) 48. Further, GLP-1RAs significantly reduce the risk of MI and stroke, but have a neutral effect on hospitalization for heart failure upon 5 available CVOTs 49. Meta-analysis of 7 CVOT pooled demonstrated that GLP-1RAs were associated with a similar decrease in MACE regardless of gender 50. From one hundred and thirteen available trials, the safety of GLP-1RAs was confirmed in pancreatitis. Conversely, treatment with GLP-1RAs can increase cholelithiasis mobility 51.",
        "Atherosclerosis with multiple and diverse drivers is a dominant complicating process in T2DM 53. Exposure to western diets pathologically alters the expression of many genes leading to atherosclerosis 16. According to a recent study, GLP-1R is mainly expressed in the macrophage enrichment region of atherosclerotic plaques, which provide us a new perspective on pharmacological modification of GLP-1R upon signal in atherosclerosis 54.",
        "Preclinical studies have shown that large doses of GLP-1RAs can reduce lipid deposition and plaque volume on the aortic surface of hyperglycemic mice via an AMPK-independent action in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemic and hyperlipidemic mice or type 1 diabetic rats 55. GLP-1RAs have direct anti-atherosclerotic effects in euglycemic mice, ApoE-/- mice or Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits in a GLP-1R-dependent manner 56-58. Therefore, these studies demonstrated that GLP-1RAs have an impact on preventing and stabilizing atherosclerotic vascular disease, which may translate into its protective effects against MACE in human subjects 59.",
        "GLP-1RAs suppress the progression of atherosclerosis in ApoE-/-, LDLr-/-, and even in moderate uremia LDLr-/- mice16, 60. This suppression is independent of plasma cholesterol changes and BW reduction through regulating markers of plaque instability and inflammation including those linked to plaque hemorrhage (CD163), matrix turnover (matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, MMP-13), cholesterol metabolism (prostaglandin I2 synthase (PTGIS), ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1)), leukocyte recruitment (C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), osteopontin (OPN), interleukin (IL)-6), and leukocyte rolling, extravasation and adhesion (vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, E-selectin (SELE)) 16. Moreover, GLP-1RAs can alleviate vascular remodeling expressed as neointimal hyperplasia after induced vascular injury. Specifically, GLP-1RAs can suppress vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration via the cAMP/PKA pathway in C57BL/6 mice 61. These findings indicate that GLP-1RAs limit and stabilize the development of atherosclerotic plaques through anti-inflammatory mechanisms and by preventing vascular remodeling 62.",
        "GLP-1RAs attenuate the activation and recruitment of macrophages into the endothelium 63. Treatment with GLP-1RAs can reduce monocyte/macrophage accumulation in the arterial wall by inhibiting the adhesion of monocytes to activated endothelium from the arteries of C57BL/6 mice as well as in ApoE-/- mice 64. GLP-1RAs can also exert anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages as well as regulating macrophage phenotype 65. For example, treatment of murine macrophages with GLP-1RAs in vitro inhibits monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 gene expression and p65 as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression. Moreover, GLP-1RAs can suppress atherosclerosis in T2DM (STZ treated) rats by inhibiting macrophage infiltration and apoptosis 66. The above studies suggest that GLP-1RAs may be a valuable strategy for the treatment of atherosclerosis (Figure 1) (Table 3).",
        "Hypertension and accompanying cardiovascular remodeling are amongst the leading drivers of atherosclerosis and causes of CVD. Endogenous GLP-1R signaling exerts a physiologically relevant effect on BP control, which may be attributable, in part, to its tonic actions on proximal tubule Na/H mediated sodium reabsorption, and the intrarenal renin-angiotensin II system 67. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, GLP-1 treatment mediates renal vasodilation and attenuates renal autoregulatory responses 68. In addition, acute renal infusion with GLP-1 can augment renal blood flow and promote natriuresis and dieresis 69. In summary, GLP-1 or GLP-1RA treatment can make a positive impact on reducing the impact of hypertension in affected patients (Figure 1).",
        "MI and its consequent tissue damage leading to heart failure are mainly responsible for the fatality in patients with T2DM. Evidence indicates that GLP-1RAs can reduce the occurrence of MI 70. Among patients with acute MI undergoing percutaneous interventions, GLP-1 treatment can reduce infarct size, together with improving left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 71. GLP-1RA (such as exendin-4) treatment can reduce the size of MI impacted cardiac volume in rats, inhibit ventricular dilation, myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy in vivo\n72. Mechanically, GLP-1RAs regulate insulin-like growth factor-1/2 and upregulate α-estrogen receptors to exert cardioprotective actions in isoprenaline-induced MI 73. In addition, another report demonstrated the reparative role of GLP-1RAs in MI via modulating sirtulin (SIRT)1/Parkin/mitophagy 74. Interestingly, even in obese swine, GLP-1R activation can improve cardiac function and augment cardiac output after MI 75. Accordingly, it is suggested that GLP-1RAs have properties of alleviating MI and repairing damaged cardiac tissue to improve cardiac function (Figure 1).",
        "Myocardial remodeling has a critical role in heart failure following MI. Disturbances in cardiac calcium metabolism are a hallmark of heart failure. GLP-1RAs prevent post-MI remodeling by having an impact on the extracellular matrix changes rather than dependency on its glycemic control 76. There is another mechanism showing that GLP-1RA treatment regulates Ca2+ levels due to reductions in the ryanodine receptor (RyR)2 phosphorylation and suppression of the activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)-II 77. Moreover, a favorable impact of GLP-1RAs on cardiac remodeling can occur through activation of the eNOS/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/protein kinase G (PKG) nexus 72.",
        "Cardiac hypertrophy leads to heart failure at the later decompensated stage of the disease process, which is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Evidence has recently revealed that GLP-1RAs inhibit cardiac hypertrophy by upregulating GLP-1R expression and activating the AMPK/mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway 78.",
        "Mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and oxidative stress are in part due to methylglyoxal accumulation. Therefore, the attenuation of methylglyoxal-induced mitochondrial abnormalities may suppress the progression of heart failure. In cultured H9c2 cells, GLP-1RAs attenuate the production of mitochondrial and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by methylglyoxal. As a result, GLP-1RAs display suppressive effects on mitochondrial functions and oxidative stress on heart failure 79.",
        "Although GLP-1RAs can play a favorable role in improving heart failure based on pre-clinical studies, whereas some clinical evidence relevantly have reported that GLP-1RAs treatment could be associated with adverse heart failure events, eg. increasing heart rate, reducing LVEF 43-45. Therefore, overall, the benefit of GLP-1RAs for heart failure has been difficult to confirm (Figure 1).",
        "Diabetic cardiomyopathy is an important cardiac complication which is accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy 78. Chronic inflammation results in the loss of cardiomyocytes in diabetic hearts. GLP-1RAs have the potential to inhibit cardiac inflammation via retarding the production of pyroptotic cytokines, caspase-1 and the AMPK-thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) pathway in high-fat diet-fed rats 80. Specifically, GLP-1RAs exert protective effects on exercise-induced cardiomyopathy via increasing autophagy, reducing inflammation-related proteins and ROS generation via restoring the expression of catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) 81.",
        "GLP-1RAs attenuate apoptosis in cardiomyocytes induced by hyperglycemia via inhibiting receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) receptor 82. In H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, GLP-1RAs protect against cell apoptosis and inhibit the expression of tumor protein P53 (p53). GLP-1RAs not only mediate the inhibition of myocardial apoptosis, but also improve cardiac energy metabolism. These studies illustrate that GLP-1RAs may confer protective effects on the progression of cardiomyopathy 83.",
        "GLP-1RA treatment also mitigates experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy by the indirect mechanisms of augmenting glucose oxidation in cardiomyocytes 84. In terms of mechanisms, GLP-1RAs can block C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via attenuating the irreversible electroporation (IRE)-α unfolded protein response (UPR) 85. There is a further action that the reduction of HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) expression gives rise to cardiomyopathy. As a result, GLP-1RAs demonstrate a new therapeutic action in cirrhotic rats with cardiomyopathy through the protective role of HOTAIR via SIRT1 activation 86.",
        "Abnormal autophagy and mitochondrial injury are involved in diabetic cardiomyopathy. The cardioprotective effects of mesenchymal stem cells, GLP-1RAs or pioglitazone may improve mitochondrial function via regulating autophagy and inflammatory signaling 87. Several studies revealed that GLP-1RAs relieve myocardial damage and glucose toxicity by promoting autophagy, which is associated with decreasing mTOR phosphorylation and increasing AMPK phosphorylation 88. Furthermore, a new orally bioavailable GLP-1RA, oral hypoglycemic peptide 2 (OHP2), can confer protective effects on diabetic cardiomyopathy through rescuing cardiac lipotoxicity by inhibiting Rho (the small GTPase) kinase (ROCK)/PPARα pathway 89, 90 (Figure 1).",
        "T2DM is characterized by the presence of chronic fluctuating hyperglycemia, obesity-associated insulin resistance as well as the impaired secretion of insulin and dysfunction of the incretin system. Although endogenous GLP-1 lowers blood glucose levels, it is degraded quickly, which results in loss of its hypoglycemic effects. It follows that long-acting GLP-1RAs have a longer half-life and show prolongation of the glucose-lowering effects 3.",
        "GLP-1RAs can improve β cell function in patients with early T2DM via coordinated regulation of the fate of α and β cells. There is evidence showing that GLP-1RAs can reduce the expression of β cell apoptotic markers Bcl-2-associated x (Bax) and caspase-3 while upregulating Bcl-2 99, 100, as well as protecting against lipotoxic stress via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/forkhead box proteins O1 (FoxO1) pathway 101. GLP-1RAs increase the sensitivity of β cells to glucose and positively reduce insulin resistance to further promote insulin secretion 102. GLP-1RAs stimulate insulin secretion and suppress glucagon secretion, which may modify cardiac energy metabolism in T2DM patients 103. Based on the above mechanisms of β cells, GLP-1RA treatment exerts favorable effects on hyperglycemia (Figure 2).",
        "The cardiovascular phenomenon of endothelial dysfunction involves a series of structural and functional abnormalities, including abnormal secretory capacity and properties of the endothelium and impaired vascular tone, as well as an impaired endothelial barrier function. GLP-1RAs stimulate NO production and eNOS activation, eliciting vasorelaxation in arterial endothelium in vitro\n104. GLP-1RAs make a direct protective impact on the endothelium by the GLP-1R-dependent AMPK/Akt/eNOS pathway 105. GLP-1RAs also promote endothelial barrier integrity via activating protein kinase A (PKA)- and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) 106. Moreover, GLP-1 exerts stabilizing effects on the endothelial contraction and barrier for AGE-treated endothelium via activating GLP-1R/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/PKA and inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways together with RAGE/Rho/ROCK 97, 98. Through the above mechanisms, GLP-1RAs can mediate the function of regulating endothelial-mediated contraction and vasodilation, as well as maintaining the stability of the endothelial barrier.",
        "GLP-1RAs can improve the efficacy of protection against the adhesion of inflammatory cells to the endothelium. Specifically, GLP-1RAs downregulate activation of VCAM‑1, the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) in endothelial cells 57. Further, GLP-1RAs block the adhesion of monocytes to endothelium induced by oxidized LDL via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 5-Kruppel-like factor (KLF)2 signaling pathway to prevent endothelial permeability 107, 108. Likewise, GLP-RAs inhibit platelet aggregation and prevent thrombosis 109. These findings indicate that GLP-1RAs have anti-adhesive and anti-thrombotic properties in the endothelium that may delay the development of atherosclerosis 110.",
        "GLP-1RAs play a key role in regulating the response to inflammation of the endothelium. Specifically, GLP-1RAs block NLRP3 (Nod-like receptor protein 3h) inflammasome via SIRT1 activation 111. GLP-1RAs also suppress the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and free fatty acid-induced cellular ROS in endothelium 112. GLP-1RAs also downregulate the expression of MMPs and tissue inhibitors of MPs (TIMPs) for anti-inflammation 110. Furthermore, noted that GLP-1RAs can increase cholesterol excretion and reduce cholesterol accumulation by promoting the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) in the endothelium. Therefore, treatment with GLP-1RAs shows favorable effects on anti-inflammation through the suppression of these proinflammatory cytokine and inflammatory signal pathways, as well as augmenting cholesterol efflux in the endothelium.",
        "GLP-1RAs can exert not only anti-inflammatory effects in the endothelium, but also anti-apoptotic effects aimed at maintaining endothelial homeostasis. GLP-1RAs ameliorate ROS-induced or hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis through modulating IL-6 production and ER stress-induced by hyperhomocysteinemia, via stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1β/C-X-C motif receptor 7 (CXCR7) -AMPK/p38-MAPK axis 113-115. Hereby, the mechanisms of the anti-apoptotic actions involve not only protein kinase cascades, but also the modulation of miRNA levels. Treatment with GLP-1RAs can regulate several pivotal miRNAs (such as miR-93-5p, miR-181a-5p and miR-34a-5p and miR-26a-5p) to inhibit apoptosis in endothelium 116. These findings collectively support the anti-apoptotic actions of GLP-1RAs as part of their effects on endothelial dysfunction.",
        "Under high glucose conditions, endothelial cells acquire the characteristics of fibroblasts, via endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). EndMT promotes diabetic cardiac fibrosis 117. EndMT relies on activating the Smad2/3-Slug pathway at an early stage 118. GLP-1 treatment protects against EndMT through inhibiting the activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) which can elicit Smad3 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 responses. Moreover, GLP-1RAs can reverse EndMT induced by high glucose and IL-1β via activating the AMPK pathway, which was evidenced by augmenting an endothelium marker expression (CD31), as well as alleviating mesenchymal markers expression (SM22α (sensitive 22 kDa actin-binding protein of the calponin), vimentin and Snail) 119. These results indicate that GLP‑1RAs have therapeutic effects against EndMT, an important process in atherosclerosis and fibrotic diseases.",
        "To summarize these mechanisms and their corresponding efficacy with GLP-1RAs or GLP-1, GLP-1RAs show the endothelial protective properties and thus owe to modulating vascular tone and maintaining endothelial barrier integrity, as well as the anti-adhesive and anti-thrombotic actions. In addition, the inhibition of EndMT, the attenuation of inflammation and apoptosis are also responsible for reversing endothelial dysfunction with GLP-1RA treatment (Figure 2).",
        "VSMC dysfunction can be defined as the occurrence of excessive proliferation, autophagy, fibrosis, senescence, and phenotypic transformation. Accordingly, VSMC dysfunction ultimately aggravates vascular injury and accelerates the development of atherosclerosis. GLP-1RAs suppress hyperglycemia-induced proliferation, migration and apoptosis of VSMCs via suppressing the ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways 10. In terms of proliferation, liraglutide attenuates VSMC proliferation induced by Ang II through eliciting cell cycle arrest and activating AMPK 120. Furthermore, the number of neuron-derived orphan receptor 1 (NOR1) which can modulate VSMC proliferation, is decreased by GLP-1RAs in a dose-dependent manner in mice 121.",
        "VSMC senescence induced by Ang II is another important aspect of VSMC dysfunction. In this regard, GLP-1RAs can provide the protection against VSMC senescence via increasing the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activity 122. In addition, GLP-1RAs inhibit superoxide anion formation and ensuing VSMC senescence through suppressing Rac1 activation via cAMP/PKA pathways 123.",
        "VSMC phenotypic switching is characterized by transformation from a quiescent contractile to an activated synthetic phenotype, promoting proliferation and leading to the formation of the neointima, the pathological vascular compartment critical for the development of atherosclerosis. In rat coronary artery smooth muscle cells, GLP-1RAs can inhibit phenotypic modulation induced by AGEs through blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway 124. Further, GLP-1RAs promote VSMC redifferentiation via AMPK/SIRT1/forkhead box O (FOXO3a) pathways, where the expression of contractile VSMCs markers (SM22α and Calponin) is increased 125. Likewise, GLP-1 inhibits VSMC dedifferentiation by regulating mitochondrial dynamics via enhancing adiponectin (APN) expression, which in turn promotes the phosphorylation of AMPK and SIRT1 in VSMC 126, 127.",
        "Osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs plays an important cytopathological role in arterial calcification. By inhibiting osteoblast differentiation of VSMCs, GLP-1RAs can ameliorate phosphate-induced vascular calcification, which is mediated by the AMPK/mTOR pathway or AMPK/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), as occurs in the osteoblast differentiation of VSMCs 128, 129.",
        "Arterial restenosis and vascular remodeling are a response to vascular injury, usually manifested as neointimal hyperplasia. GLP-1RAs can inhibit neointimal hyperplasia by suppressing VSMC proliferation and migration as mentioned above. GLP-1 treatment can exert the direct action on reversing vascular remodeling by downregulating MMP1 expression via alleviating the ERK1/2/NF-κB pathway in Ang II-induced rat aortic VSMCs 130. Furthermore, GLP-1R activation can prevent arterial restenosis through inhibiting VSMC proliferation and migration via stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) 131.",
        "As a result, GL-1RAs play a role in reversing or improving VSMC dysfunction by suppressing VSMCs proliferation, migration, apoptosis, as well as inhibiting VSMC phenotypic switching, especially inhibiting osteoblastic differentiation. GLP-1RAs have an impact in reversing vascular remodeling and attenuating the progression of VSMC senescence (Figure 2).",
        "Under pathological stress, macrophages contribute to inflammatory responses, which drive insulin resistance and T2DM. In this regard, GLP-1RAs (exendin-4, for example) not only alleviate macrophage infiltration, but also suppress IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α expression. Mechanistically, in macrophages, GLP-1RAs directly ameliorate NF-κB activation, thereby improving insulin resistance 132. In addition, GLP-1RAs and metformin can suppress pro-inflammatory phenotypes of monocyte/macrophages through impacts on the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBP β), together with MAPK and NF-κB 133. As a result, GLP-1RAs can inhibit macrophage‑associated inflammation through the above mechanisms.",
        "The transformation of monocyte/macrophages into foam cells, is the hallmark of atherogenesis. Vascular located monocytes/macrophages engulf oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL), generating foam cells which release a plethora of pro-inflammatory mediators. The process of foam cell formation occurs via the imbalanced influx and efflux of modified lipoproteins. After lipid uptake, acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) catalyzes cholesterol esterification. GLP-1RAs can suppress foam cell formation by activating GLP-1R signaling induced autophagy 134, reducing ACAT1 expression/activity 93, as well as inhibiting the PKA/CD36 pathway to inhibit ox-LDL uptake 135. Although in foam cells, GLP-1RAs also can protect against oxidative stress and steatosis via modulation of AMPK/sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1) 136. Therefore, the reduction of foam cells with GLP-1RAs treatment is speculated to inhibit vascular senescence and delay the progression of atherosclerosis.",
        "The activation of macrophages by GLP-1 also contributes to anti-inflammatory factor secretion and M2 polarization. In this regard, GLP-1 treatment leads to decreased expression of macrophage‑specific markers for M1 (inducible NOS (iNOS), IL‑6 and TNF‑α) and enhances expression level of M2-marker genes, including arginine‑1, macrophage galectin-1 (MGL-1), IL‑10, as well as mannose receptor-1 (MRC-1). Mechanistic evidence has indicated that GLP-1RAs promote bone marrow-derived macrophage polarization into the M2 phenotype via the cAMP-PKA-signal transducers and activators of the transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway 137, 138. It is acknowledged that activation of STAT3 which is crucial to M2 phenotype transformation, while STAT1 activity which is a key determinant for the M1 subtype. Hereby, GLP-1RAs can diminish STAT1 activity 91. By modulating macrophage polarization towards an M2 subtype, GLP-1RAs can inhibit inflammation occurring in the vessel lumen, an action which would alleviate the progression of atherosclerosis (Figure 2).",
        "NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by hyperglycemia can cause endothelial dysfunction in T2DM. GLP-1RAs suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation via attenuating the expression of NLRP3, apoptotic speck containing protein (ASC), and cleaves caspase 1 (p10) 111. Besides, in H9c2 cardiomyocytes, GLP-1RAs also inhibit hypoxia-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activity and TNF-α to attenuate pyroptosis through modulating the SIRT1/NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4)/ROS pathway 139. Whereas, the suppression of NLRP3 can be functioned by GLP-1RAs not only directly but also indirectly.",
        "In addition, the inhibition of NLRP3 activation by GLP-1RAs requires regulation of the mitochondrial pathway. GLP-1RAs augment the mitophagy pathway to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome and ameliorate oxidative stress-induced injury in the liver 140. Hereby, the suppression of inflammatory injury with GLP-1RAs treatment can be eliminated by 3-methyladenine/the mitochondrial kinase (PINK1) siRNA 141. Moreover, what is clinically noteworthy, is that GLP-1RA treatment can reduce intimal hyperplasia after stent implantation by modulating the above pathway 142. Combined with above-mentioned data, GLP-1RAs show a positive impact on the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome (Figure 2).",
        "The development of diabetes and obesity is underpinned by chronic inflammation 143. In this context, GLP-1RAs can inhibit the secretion of IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-γ, thereby regulating the immune microenvironment and preventing diabetes 144. GLP-1RA can inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis in the early phase by regulation of immune cell phenotypes. Particularly, liraglutide attenuates pre-established atherosclerosis throughout the aorta and aortic root in ApoE-/- mice via increasing macrophage polarization into anti-inflammatory macrophages and by reducing the number of pro-inflammatory macrophages 92. By doing so, in atherosclerotic plaques from murine aortas, GLP-1RAs regulate proinflammatory mediators and the phenotype of immune cells.",
        "The immuno-modulatory effects of GLP-1RAs also suggest their potential in T1DM. In non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice which are a murine model of T1DM, GLP-1RAs can improve immune functions and inflammatory responses as well as mitigating against islet cell damage, an action which may be related to the decrease in the expression of miR-19b 145. Similarly, GLP-1RAs exert the potential protection against inflammatory responses in T1DM through decreasing IFN-γ secretion and downregulating PD-1 expression in T cells by attenuating the Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT pathway 146, 147. Thus, GLP-1RAs play an underlying role in immune-regulation in T1DM (Figure 2).",
        "Aging is a crucial component of the pathogenesis of CVD, as reflected by increased oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defense, responses which may be induced by psychosocial stress 122, 148. ROS and inflammation are main mediators of vascular senescence. GLP-1RAs alleviate vascular aging under chronic stress via increasing adiponectin (APN) levels and inhibiting aortic MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression in ApoE-/- mice 96, 149. Excessive autophagy is another cause of vascular aging. GLP-1 treatment can attenuate abnormal autophagy induced by ROS and inflammation through upregulating HDAC6 via the GLP-1R-ERK1/2 pathway 150. ER stress and DNA damage are also responsible for vascular senescence. Regarding this, GLP-1RAs inhibit ER stress and promote protein folding via endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase (ERO1α) in an AMPK-dependent manner, as well as mediating the process of mitochondrial fusion 115, 151. For senescence of VSMCs, GLP-1RAs activate Nrf2 and inhibit Rac1 through cAMP/PKA pathways to prevent Ag II-induced senescence 122, 123. In brief, all of the mechanisms and actions that have protective efficiency on endothelium and VSMCs, can play a role in preventing vascular senescence (Figure 2).",
        "Cardiomyocyte/cardiac fibroblast dysfunction is related to abnormal proliferation, apoptosis, hypertrophy, as well as inflammation and fibrosis, which may be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disorders. Persistent hyperglycemia can mediate hypoxic or ischemic injury, as well as elicit cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction and the NF-κB signaling pathway activation, thus inducing ER stress 152. GLP-1RA can help maintain a balance of energy metabolism in cardiomyocytes through activating PI3K/Akt as well as p38 MAPK pathways as well as activating Nrf-2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), contributing to augmented adenosine triphosphate formation and glucose ingestion by cardiomyocytes 153-155. Based on these pathways, GLP-1RAs improve metabolic disorders to alleviate cardiomyocyte dysfunction.",
        "Apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is usually irreversible, leading to myocardial damage. GLP-1RAs make an impact on anti-apoptosis through multiple pathways. Firstly, the impact is partly due to ameliorating caspase-3 and Bax activity and upregulating Bcl-2 156. Secondly, GLP-1RAs attenuate apoptosis induced by TNF-α by ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction related to activating the GLP-1R/cAMP/PKA and AMPK/SIRT1 pathway 94, 157, 158. Thirdly, GLP-1RAs exert anti-apoptotic actions attributable to the activation of Notch signaling 159. Fourthly, GLP-1 protects cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress and apoptosis in diabetes mellitus, through the mTOR complex1/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) pathway 160. Fifth, GLP-1RAs protect against cardiomyocyte apoptosis under diabetic conditions via activating the leucine zipper motif (APPL1)-AMPK-PPARα axis and the AMPK-TXNIP pathway 80, 161.",
        "Cardiac inflammation, fibrosis and hypertrophy are the main manifestations of myocardial dysfunction. Hyperglycemia-mediated cardiomyocyte damage is associated with inflammation. GLP-1RAs can have effects on inflammation and defending ER stress via suppressing NF-κB in diabetic cardiomyocyte models 152. GLP-1R can also suppress cardiac hypertrophy induced by Ang II through attenuating the Nox4-histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) axis 162. Apart from these actions, GLP-1RAs ameliorate cardiac fibrosis induced by abdominal aortic constriction via interfering with Ang II type 1 receptor signaling 163. Therefore, GLP-1RAs can provide protective effects on the above undesirable physiological phenomena in cardiomyocytes.",
        "GLP-1RAs can modulate intracellular calcium homeostasis to prevent reperfusion injury directly in cardiomyocytes 164. GLP-1RAs also exert anti-arrhythmic effects via reducing calcium leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in ventricular arrhythmia, which has the potential to decrease phosphorylation of the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and alleviate the activity of CaMK-II 77. Moreover, GLP-1R activation counteracts the effects of β-adrenoceptor stimulation on cardiac ventricular excitability and reduces ventricular arrhythmic potential 165. Apart from maintaining calcium channel homeostasis, GLP-1RAs also activate ATP-sensitive potassium channels to attenuate cardiac apoptosis and hypertrophy induced by pressure overload 166.",
        "In addition to regulating cardiomyocyte function, GLP-1RAs also improve the function of cardiac fibroblasts. For example, GLP-1RAs may modulate the CD36-JNK-AP1 pathway by partially down-regulating prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha-1 (P4HA1), and then inhibit ROS production mediated by Ang II type I receptor, thereby ameliorating cardiac fibroblast proliferation and myocardial fibrosis 167, 168. Furthermore, as for cardiac fibroblasts, GLP-1RAs inhibit Ang II and glucose-induced collagen formation via decreasing phospho-NF-κB-p65 and phospho-ERK1/2 expression 169 (Figure 2).",
        "To sum up, GLP-1RAs improve cardiomyocyte/cardiac fibroblast dysfunction by making balancing energy metabolism, and multiple pathways related to AMPK to inhibit cardiac apoptosis. Moreover, the suppression of cardiac inflammation, fibrosis and hypertrophy with GLP-1RA treatment provide a clinically favorable impact on cardiac dysfunction.",
        "In the GLP-1RA family of agents, the results of CVOT have been inconsistent. The baseline characteristics of the study populations, study drugs and study designs may be considered as possible reasons for the variability 170. Furthermore, a real-world retrospective study comparing the compliance of patients receiving different GLP-1RAs for the treatment of hyperglycemic found that even if GLP-1RA weekly preparations were used, there were still differences in compliance 171. Such differences in compliance between GLP-1RA preparations are mainly due to the differences between injection devices 172. Ultimately, the duration of GLP-1RA treatment seems to be the factor that explains the heterogeneity of the clinical studies involving GLP-1RA.",
        "Although some promising observations have been reported in various animal models, the impact of GLP-1RAs on human myocardial function is more heterogeneous. In a randomized controlled study, exenatide administered once a week for 18 months did not change carotid plaque volume or composition 173. Further, while GLP-1RAs have a positive impact on the LVEF, it seems to be inconsistent in most patients with heart failure and effects are quite limited 174. However, it is currently unclear and to what extent the differences observed in CVOT reflect the heterogeneous pharmacological properties of each drug in the GLP-1RA category. In order to enhance the clinical interpretation of these CVOTs, researchers have quantified the absolute treatment effect over time based on the number of treatments required to avoid a MACE, thus revealed the difference between GLP-1RA 175. Also, due to the important role of endothelial dysfunction in CVD, the effects of GLP-1RA on flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in patients remain to be investigated for their contribution to the CVD actions of GLP-1RAs.",
        "Our understanding of the disease mechanisms and molecular targets of drugs has been facilitated by new biotechnology advances, such as RNA sequencing. RNA-seq can also be used as a useful tool to dissect the molecular targets of drugs in CVD 176. Therefore, the use of new technological advances such as single cell RNA-seq can shed new light on the GLP-1RA-dependent and independent effects and targets in animal models and humans 177.",
        "Due to the high expression profile of GLP-1R in pancreatic β-cells, GLP-1 analogs (such as exendin-4) have been modified by different methods (to prolong half-life, maintain receptor binding affinity and reduce renal drug accumulation) for theranostic purposes and serve as excellent templates for future cardiovascular drug development178-184. More importantly, these modified GLP-1 analogues have shown hypoglycemic 185, 186 and cardiovascular protective effects 180, 183 in different animal models. Further exploration of these modified agents in animal models of cardiometabolic diseases will deepen our understanding of the potential cardioprotective mechanisms of GLP-1 and GLP-1RAs and potentially provide future directions for precise therapeutic intervention 180.",
        "GLP-1RAs are a class of agents with pleiotropic activities additional to the lowering of blood glucose. These pleiotropic effects include the reduction of BW and BP, the improvement of lipid metabolism and a spectrum of cardioprotective effects. The current comprehensive management strategy of diabetes has gradually shifted from “hypoglycemic as the focus” to “emphasizing both the control of blood glucose and the improvement of MACE and cardiovascular outcomes” 187, 188. In this regard, GLP-1RAs have shown promising efficacy as to the improvement of hard cardiovascular outcomes with cardiovascular safety.",
        "The ADA standard for the treatment of diabetes updated in 2020 indicated that patients with T2DM diagnosed with CVD or those with CVD risk factors can use GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors with evidence of cardiovascular benefits to reduce cardiovascular risk, regardless of HbA1c levels or individualized HbA1c control objectives 189. This guideline emphasizes the importance of the primary and secondary prevention of CVD with both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors. It remains to be investigated whether cardiovascular protective effects of GLP-1RAs can also be independent of the known effects on glucose metabolism. In the future, more GLP-1RAs will be explored for the improvement of ischemic stroke and cognitive impairment in patients with diabetes 190. More importantly, endocrinologists should work coordinately with cardiologists and pharmacologists to establish GLP-1RA-dependent and independent effects in preparation for precisely commencing therapy with GLP-1RAs in suitable targeted patient categories.",

        "The potential cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1RA. GLP-1RAs have effects on limiting atherosclerosis, controlling hypertension, and delaying the progression of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cardiomyopathy. For a brief description, GLP-1RAs attenuate and stabilize the development of atherosclerotic plaques through anti-inflammatory mechanisms and preventing vascular remodeling, and inhibit activation and recruitment of macrophages in atherosclerosis. For hypertension, GLP-1RAs augment renal blood flow and promote natriuresis and diuresis. For myocardial infarction, GLP-1RAs alleviate and repair MI via SIRT1/Parkin/mitophagy, insulin-like growth factor-1/2 and upregulating α-estrogen receptor. For heart failure, GLP-1RAs remodel calcium circulation disorders, inhibit cardiac hypertrophy by activating the AMPK/ mTOR signaling pathway and attenuate methylglyoxal-induced mitochondrial abnormalities. For cardiomyopathy, GLP-1RAs improve mitochondrial function via regulating autophagy and inflammatory signaling, as well as not only mediate the inhibition of myocardial apoptosis, but also improve cardiac energy metabolism.",

        "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder, characterized by hyperglycemia (increased blood glucose), which results from a lack of, or non-functioning, insulin thereby leaving the glucose in the bloodstream as cells are not able to take it up. The history of diabetes dates back to around 1500 BC, though it was not well understood [1], and 3500 years later, it is still a menace. It is approximated that about 537 million individuals have been diagnosed with diabetes in the year 2021 and this is predicted to increase to about 643 million people by 2030 [2]. About 75% of those living with diabetes are residents in middle- and low-income nations, while about 50% are undiagnosed. About 11.2 million Nigerians are living with DM with the highest and lowest prevalence rates seen in the South-South and North-Western zones, respectively [3].",
        "Over the years, DM has been classified into four categories: Type 1 DM (T1DM), which usually occurs in childhood (also known as juvenile-onset), is caused by a deficiency of insulin as a result of antibodies attacking and destroying the pancreas that produces insulin. Type 2 DM (T2DM) also known as non-insulin dependent, or adult-onset has to do with insulin resistance. Here, insulin is produced, but the body cells are unable to respond to it. It is the most common of the types of DM and it takes up about 90% of all the types. Gestational diabetes is the third type, and this is seen in pregnancy as some sort of insulin resistance develops in mid to late pregnancy. It poses a threat to the fetus as excess glucose can pass through the placenta and affect the baby’s growth and development. The fourth type of DM is the group of other forms, which could result due to genetic defect, diseases of the pancreas, infections, certain surgeries, and drug use [4].",
        "Prolonged hyperglycemia is the cause of several complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease and cancer associated with DM. The higher the amount of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), known as the level of glucose in the blood, the more the risk. High HbA1c can result in serious diseases affecting almost all organs of the body. There are different classifications of complications arising from DM, which include chronic and acute as well as microvascular or macrovascular complications. While chronic complications refer to diseases that build up over time as a result of prolonged hyperglycemia, acute complications are rather sudden and are usually life-threatening. Acute complications include hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypers (very high blood sugar), and hypos (very low blood sugar). Chronic complications include neuropathy (nerve damage), nephropathy (kidney problems), retinopathy (eye problems), stroke/heart attack, foot problems, gum disease, and sexual problems in both men and women (Figure 1). Microvascular complications (Figure 1) include neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy while macrovascular complications (Figure 1) are atherosclerosis of large vessels, which can lead to peripheral arterial disease, cardiovascular disease and stroke [5,6].",
        "The kidney is an important organ in the body responsible for waste removal, body fluids and blood pressure balance, and glycemic control [7]. Glucose homeostasis in the kidney occurs because it produces, releases into circulation, and uses glucose, an important energy source for the renal medulla [8]. The kidneys are made up of millions of tiny blood vessels known as glomeruli, which filter waste from the blood. Under normal conditions, the glomerulus of the kidney filters about 162 to 180 g of glucose per day with almost all the glucose being reabsorbed by sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) [7,8]. About 90% is reabsorbed by SGLT2 which is expressed in the proximal tubule while the SGLT1 transporter in the lower proximal tubule absorbs the other 10% to avoid the passing out of glucose in the urine (glycosuria) [8]. There is, however, a threshold, where the plasma glucose concentration exceeds 180 mg/dL, and the kidney is likely unable to reabsorb all the glucose, leading to the appearance of glucose in the urine.",
        "In hyperglycemic conditions, where there is an excessive blood glucose level, the kidney reabsorbs glucose and adds to the already elevated concentrations thereby contributing to hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) and SGLT2 are upregulated in DM and glucose transport into the cells is significantly increased, suggesting that the kidney contributes to hyperglycemia through gluconeogenesis and enhanced glucose reabsorption. A study conducted by Meyer et al. [9], on the release of glucose by the liver and kidneys in diabetic animals, reported a 300% increase in renal glucose release in diabetic subjects compared to nondiabetic subjects. On the other hand, excess glucose in the blood can cause the glomeruli to be narrow and clogged, thereby blocking the free flow of blood, which can eventually damage the kidney, leading to the leakage of protein albumin out of the glomeruli into the urine. The presence of albumin in the urine is the test carried out to detect early kidney damage as there may not be any symptoms until kidney failure. Consequently, hyperglycemia affects the kidney which in turn results in more hyperglycemia until the kidney is damaged if not controlled in time.",
        "The inflammation and degeneration of peripheral nerves is referred to as neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a collection of nerve disorders manifesting as complications of DM. Nerve damage throughout the body takes time to develop and is sometimes without symptoms in some individuals, while others may experience pain, and numbness in legs, feet, hands and arms. Nerve damage can occur in every organ system. It has been estimated that about 7 out of 10 people with DM have a type of neuropathy [10]. DN has been classified into rapidly reversible, persistent and focal/multifocal neuropathies. The rapidly reversible type is known as hyperglycemic neuropathy [11]. Another classification according to Watkins, classified neuropathies into two distinct types: those that progress as the period of diabetes increases and others that usually recover completely [12]. Autonomic and sensory neuropathies are those that mostly progress while acute, painful neuropathies, radiculopathies and mononeuropathies, although usually presented with severe symptoms, are just for a period as they tend to be reversible [13].",
        "Of all the types of neuropathies, peripheral neuropathy (PN), also known as distal symmetric or sensorimotor neuropathy, characterized by nerve damage in the arms and legs, is the most common. PN causes muscle weakness and loss of reflexes at the ankle, leading to foot deformities, collapse of midfoot, and changes in the way a person walks. As a result of numbness in the foot, blisters, sores, and injury go unnoticed until infected, which may spread to the bone leading to eventual amputation [14].",
        "Hyperglycemia and other metabolic factors such as impaired insulin signaling and hyperlipidemia is known to drive peripheral nerve fiber and microvessel dysfunction which leads to various downstream pathogenic pathways. It has been established that hyperglycemia contributes to oxidative stress via the overactivation of polyol, protein kinase C, and hexosamine pathways, which also occur in the nerves and microvessels. Overall, the pathophysiology of DN remains largely unknown and this is a limiting factor to the development of pathogenetic treatments [13].",
        "The key reason for death and disability among persons living with diabetes is cardiovascular disease (CVD) [15]. The major CVDs linked with T2DM include peripheral artery disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure and ischemic heart disease, all of which can lead to death in no less than 50% of T2DM-affected persons [16]. Hyperglycemia and resistance to insulin are usually the main characteristics of T2DM, which sometimes go with abnormal lipid metabolism. Insulin resistance is implicated in the onset and advancement of CVD and T2DM, and it is linked with an increased risk of CVD events. To reduce the occurrence of CVD, achieving a glycemic control target of less than 7% is important.",
        "Diabetic cardiomyopathy shows changes in the heart functionally and structural changes to the left ventricle. There is an increase in the left ventricular mass compared to normal or non-diabetics which is due to the increased release of cytokines. Another proposed mechanism for the dysfunction of the cardiac system is the increased content of triglycerides in the cardiomyocytes as a result of its increased synthesis in diabetics [17].",
        "It has been established already that there is a link between diabetes and cancer. DM, both types 1 and 2, increases the chance of having some kinds of cancer, and the risk is higher in women than men. There is evidence to suggest that cancer patients with diabetes have an increased risk of mortality and various infection-related morbidities [18]. Diabetes and cancer both have similar factors that exacerbate them such as aging, obesity, unhealthy diet and smoking. Several studies are trying to investigate the link between obesity and breast cancer, but with conflicting results [19].",
        "Nonetheless, insulin is an important hormone that activates many pathways implicated in type 2 diabetes and cancer [20]. When insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and the tyrosine residue of the IR are phosphorylated. IRS then phosphorylates phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) which downstream activates AKT/mTOR network signaling (Figure 2). In the same vein, insulin activates insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) which leads to downstream phosphorylation cascades that activate PI3K/AKT/mTOR-network signaling and RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [21]. Studies have shown that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR-network signaling pathway is frequently activated in basal-type breast cancer [20].",
        "Glucose enters glycolysis and Kreb’s cycle in the mitochondria to generate ATP. The process generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is increased in a hyperglycemic state as excess electrons convert oxygen to superoxide and then to hydrogen peroxide. High levels of ROS are a significant factor in cancer initiation and progression as DNA, proteins, and the lipid bilayer are damaged. Also, ROS has been implicated in breast cancer as pro-oncogenic pathways such as Wnt/beta-catenin, RAS and c-MYC are activated [23].",
        "Lastly, cancer cells are highly glucose-dependent, generating their energy via aerobic glycolysis, a metabolic switch known as the “Warburg effect” as opposed to oxidative phosphorylation. This switch is needed to help the cells adapt to their hypotoxic tumor microenvironment [24]. This glucose-loving property of cancer cells would suggest that drugs that can lower blood glucose should be able to tackle cancer cells so that they are deprived and will therefore eventually die. Several studies are still on-going, while some have reported that metformin can reduce cancer incidence by 30–50% [25] and tends to impede tumor development in T2DM patients [26].",
        "On the other hand, it is interesting to note that immunotherapy, one of many cancer treatments, may cause type 1 diabetes, although this is not common. Activated immune systems may attack beta-cells in the pancreas leading to diabetes [27].",
        "An incretin-based remedy represents a promising and innovative method for managing diabetes for several compelling reasons. Introducing an incretin-based medication would mark a significant advancement as the first antidiabetic agent capable of stimulating insulin secretion without the drawbacks of hypoglycemia or weight gain [28]. Current studies underscore the pivotal role of GLP-1 as the primary hormone with incretin activity, which is regulated by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) enzymes [28]. The recognition that individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often exhibit diminished incretin responses has spurred progress in disease management. GLP-1 inducers like metformin or GLP-1 mimetics like exenatide and liraglutide have shown efficacy in improving glycated hemoglobin levels as standalone therapies or when used with other agents [28]. Notably, these agents are associated with weight reduction or are weight-neutral and carry a low risk of hypoglycemia, enhancing their clinical value. Given the short half-life of GLP-1 (2–3 min), more stable GLP-1 agonists emerge as preferred treatment options [28].",
        "Metformin has traditionally been employed in hyperglycemia control in T2DM patients and is now recommended as a primary treatment alongside lifestyle modifications [29]. Metformin is increasingly combined with newer incretin-based medications, including GLP-1 analogues and DPP-4 inhibitors, which enhance pancreatic beta cell function [30,31]. Interestingly, some reports suggest a direct interplay between metformin and the incretin axis [32]. Studies have shown that metformin acutely increases plasma GLP-1 levels after oral glucose intake while having no significant effect on glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) or peptide YY levels [33,34,35,36]. Metformin’s impact on the gut endocrine system appears to be L-cell specific, primarily affecting GLP-1 secretion [37,38]. Additionally, metformin may inhibit the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, potentially stimulating GLP-1 secretion through TGR5 activation [37,38]. Another proposed mechanism involves metformin inhibiting DPP-4 activity, leading to increased plasma GLP-1 levels [39,40].",
        "Exenatide, a synthetic analogue of exendin-4 derived from the Gila monster, shares a similar embryonic origin with human GLP-1 but is immune to DPP-4 degradation [41,42]. FDA and EMEA approvals for exenatide include use as an add-on therapy to metformin, sulphonylureas, or thiazolidinediones for T2DM treatment [43]. Reported side effects of exenatide include nausea, vomiting, and rare cases of pancreatitis [44].",
        "Liraglutide, another synthetic analogue of human GLP-1, exhibits resistance to DPP-4 degradation and demonstrates safety profiles unaffected by renal or hepatic impairment [33,34]. Despite the benefits of GLP-1 agonists in diabetes management, concerns about severe side effects like pancreatitis, and renal and hepatic impairments have emerged.",
        "GLP-1 functions within the pancreas to lower blood glucose levels through various mechanisms. It works by enhancing insulin synthesis and release, promoting neogenesis and proliferation, and reducing apoptosis of β cells [45]. The process of GLP-1-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells was extensively researched as the principal intracellular signaling pathway mediated by GLP-1r [45].",
        "In this pathway, GLP-1r acts via Gαs to activate adenylate cyclase, leading to increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) [46]. Elevated cAMP levels facilitate protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent intracellular signaling and exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) processes. Activation of these pathways enables GLP-1 to trigger various cellular mechanisms that culminate in insulin release and genetic modifications [47,48,49,50,51]. GLP-1 is demonstrated to operate through PKA and EPAC (cAMP-dependent pathways) to inhibit ATP-regulated potassium channels [52,53,54,55], boost the activity of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) [56,57], and induce the opening of non-specific cation channels (refer to Figure 3) [58,59]. These combined actions promote calcium influx, consequently enhancing calcium-induced insulin secretion. Notably, blocking ATP-regulated potassium channels leads to heightened glucose-induced membrane depolarization, thereby increasing cellular sensitivity to glucose [60]. There is limited evidence suggesting that analogous mechanisms may occur in GLP-1r-expressing neurons in the hippocampus and hypothalamus [61,62,63].",
        "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, also known as GLP-1 receptor agonists or incretin mimetics, are medicines used in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus and sometimes obesity. Examples include exenatide, lixisenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide [64]. Metformin remains the preferred initial treatment for type 2 diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association. However, adding a GLP-1 analog is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to metformin, those whose hemoglobin A1c is more than 1.5% above target, or individuals not achieving their A1c goal within three months, especially those with atherosclerosis, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease [65,66,67]. Additionally, semaglutide and high-dose liraglutide are FDA-approved for obesity treatment and can be prescribed to obese patients with comorbidities. Research suggests that GLP-1 analogs may benefit type 1 diabetes patients by improving hemoglobin A1c levels and promoting weight loss. However, high costs and tolerability issues remain barriers to broader use [68,69,70].",
        "Structurally, GLP-1 agonists can be categorized into two groups: those with a human GLP-1 backbone (including dulaglutide, albiglutide, liraglutide, and semaglutide) and those with an exendin-4 backbone (such as exenatide in its various formulations and lixisenatide) [64].",
        "Tirzepatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor dual agonist. Safety concerns have led to the discontinuation of research on another agent, taspoglutide, during phase III trials [71].",
        "GLP-1 receptor agonists intervene in several molecular and cellular stages of atherogenesis. GLP-1 plays pivotal roles in diminishing reactive oxygen species production, platelet activation, macrophage and monocyte activation, and subsequent accumulation in vascular walls, as well as inhibiting endothelin production, leading to vasodilation. GLP-1 receptor agonists amplify these beneficial actions [72,73]. Additionally, these medications stabilize endothelial cells, reducing plaque hemorrhage and rupture ultimately decelerating atherosclerosis progression [74,75].",
        "The precise mechanisms responsible for the GLP-1 receptor agonists’ renal protective effects are not entirely clear. However, these drugs lower hemoglobin A1c, weight, and blood pressure, thereby modifying the conventional risk factors for chronic kidney disease and the progression of diabetic nephropathy [76]. Furthermore, GLP-1 receptors are present in the cells of renal proximal convoluted tubules and preglomerular vascular smooth muscle, and their direct stimulation inhibits the sodium–hydrogen exchanger 3 at the brush border of proximal convoluted tubular cells. This results in increased natriuresis and consequently reduced blood pressure.",
        "In rat studies, GLP-1 receptor agonists stimulate hypothalamic GLP-1 receptors thereby preventing meal initiation and inducing meal termination [77]. Human studies also demonstrated that patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists experienced reduced energy intake, suppressed appetite, and diminished food cravings. These patients exhibited altered taste preferences, a decreased inclination towards fatty and energy-dense foods, and reduced pleasure in eating [78]. These hypothalamic effects may differ among patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists.",
        "Medicinal plants, also referred to as phytomedicinals, are plants which can be administered as a part or whole, in the form of tea, extract or tinctures, to treat illness. The use of plants as medicine has a long history; for instance, willow (Salix sp.) has been used for medical purposes for 6000 years [79], while the synthetic drug aspirin was created from salicylic acid extracted from willow bark in 1987 [80]. Primary and secondary metabolites are two categories of chemical molecules produced by plants and generally known as phytochemicals. Secondary metabolites have a variety of roles in many aspects of plant life, including competition, protection from disease and damage, and species interaction. Primary metabolites aid in plant development and metabolism. Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines of nucleic acids are examples of primary metabolites. According to Rabikadeh et al. [81], secondary metabolites are substances produced by the cell from the primary metabolic pathways and have been reported to have antifungal, antiviral, and antibiotic properties.",
        "Phytochemicals not only have therapeutic effects but also have additional properties such as promoting health, preventing disease, and supplying nutrients to the body which allow them to be considered as functional foods or nutraceuticals [82]. Foods capable of performing required functions are natural or processed food products, which contain essential nutrients that help the body to prevent, and/or manage the treatment of diseases [83]. Studies have shown that a group of phytochemicals such as organosulfur compounds, including allium compounds and glucosinolates, carotenoids, phytosterols, phytostanols and phenolic compounds (phenolic acids, flavonoids, phytoestrogens) prevent certain chronic diseases, e.g., CVDs, cancer, and diabetes, when consumed [84]. For instance, flavonoids, a subclass of polyphenols, provide health benefits by scavenging free radicals and regenerating other dietary antioxidants and chelate pro-oxidant metals [85]. They are known to prevent CVDs, diabetes, and osteoporosis and treat wound healing [86]. Also, a phytochemical in cruciferous vegetables known as glucosinolates was found to protect against cancer of the stomach, rectum, and colon [87]. The various classes of phytochemicals in medicinal plants have made possible their diverse functions, in addition to therapeutics and functional foods, such as cosmetics, fragrances, supplements, etc.",
        "There is no specific classification of the secondary metabolites of plants but they have been grouped according to their structure as shown in Figure 4. The groups include phenolic compounds, alkaloids, terpenoids, saponins, and carotenoids.",
        "They are the most widely distributed compounds in plants with an -OH group bonded to an aromatic hydrocarbon group [83]. The majority of plant phenolic chemicals are flavonoids; other types include glucosides and aglycones. Tannins are phenolic polymers. Numerous pharmacological effects, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and cytotoxic properties, have been linked to flavonoids. Since they scavenge reactive oxygen species and free radicals, they are well-recognized and referred to as antioxidants [88].",
        "The name is from “alkaline” as they are basic in character. These are naturally occurring substances, having heterocyclic nitrogen atoms and an unpleasant taste. One such is quinine, which has a bitter taste. They are categorized by the nature of the heterocyclic ring present in their structure such as pyrrolidine, pyridine–piperidine, and isoquinoline alkaloids. They are used in neuro-pharmaceuticals in anti-cancer, sedative, anti-microbial roles, and as insecticides [88].",
        "Using isoprene (CH2=C(CH3)-CH=CH2) as their building block, they are components of essential oils that are used in food and cosmetics as flavors and perfumes. The majority of them contain basic carbon skeletons and multicyclic structures with various functional groups. They are divided into six groups: sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, tetraterpenoids, hemiterpenoids, and monoterpenoids. They have hepaticidal, anti-microbial, detoxifying, strengthening, anti-rheumatic, and anti-malarial properties [88,89].",
        "The term “saponin” comes from the stable foam they produce in aqueous solutions, similar to soap. Triterpenoids, steroid alkaloids, and glycosylated steroids are examples of saponin. Most saponins are considered as a component of a plant’s defensive mechanism since they are known to shield plants against insect damage [90]. However, they have been researched and found to be hypocholesterolemic, anti-carcinogenic, hypoglycemic, antifungal, and antiviral [88].",
        "They are fat-soluble pigments which could be yellow, orange or red. They are divided into two major classes: those that have oxygen-free hydrocarbons, like lycopene, beta- and alpha-carotene, and those that have oxygenated hydrocarbons, e.g., xanthophylls. They are known to prevent eye diseases and protect against carcinogens in the breast, liver, colon, brain, cervix, and prostate [83].",
        "The pathogenesis of several human diseases such as CVD, some cancers, and aging are linked to excessive production of oxidants in the body leading to oxidative damage. Antioxidant phytochemicals have been studied and are known to prevent and treat diseases [91]. For instance, the phytochemical class known as polyphenol chelates to pro-oxidant metals and produces and protects dietary antioxidants like vitamin E, and eliminates free radicals. Turmeric’s hydrophobic polyphenol, curcumin, protects the skin from damage by scavenging free radicals and lowering inflammation by blocking NF-ҡB [92]. Chronic inflammation is another component that contributes to the development of chronic diseases including CVD, cancer, and DM. Studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic cell growth effects of curcumin through downregulating survivin and IGF-1 (insulin growth factor) expression, upregulating p53 expression, and lowering tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels, which triggers apoptotic signals [93,94].",
        "As previously noted, there is a connection between inflammation, obesity, and diabetes. According to research, curcumin reduces leukocyte adherence to the endothelium, which reduces vascular inflammation in rats with diabetes. It also reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) by downregulating increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) [95]. Furthermore, other researchers found that curcumin decreased NF-ҡB activation and IL-1β production in the retina of diabetic rats, indicating that curcumin may have therapeutic benefits for diabetic retinopathy [96]. Baicalein, a flavone derived from Scutellaria baicalensis, was found to have an impact on renal inflammatory processes by lowering the expression of TGF-β, iNOS, and NF-ҡB in the kidney, suggesting its effect in diabetic nephropathy [97].",
        "Phytochemicals have been observed to potentially stimulate the GLP-1 receptor on enteroendocrine cells within the gut, initiating a cascade of signal transduction events involving key proteins such as G protein-gustducin, phospholipase C beta 2 (PLCβ2), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R3), and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels [28]. These processes ultimately lead to the depolarization of the enteroendocrine cell membrane by increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels, resulting in the release of GLP-1 [28]. Figure 5 illustrates a schematic representation of the GLP-1-mediated insulin secretion from beta cells.",
        "The plant kingdom presents a significant flair for the discovery of novel medicines to treat various diseases, which include diabetes mellitus (DM). According to a literature search and survey, approximately 400 plants and 700 plant-based recipes have been documented worldwide for managing DM [98]. The mechanisms of action of medicinal plants in diabetes management include the regeneration of β cells and the improvement of insulin secretion from the pancreas, increased glucose uptake by muscles and adipose tissue, decreased gluconeogenesis, and the inhibition of intestinal α-glucosidase [99]. Recent studies have identified GLP-1 modulatory activity in medicinal plants [100,101,102], which holds promise for diabetes management. Table 1 provides an overview of medicinal plants with GLP-1-inducing activity.",
        "Extensive studies have been carried out on some phytochemicals in different diabetic models to understand their mechanism of action (Table 2). One of these is the study of Cicero and Tartagni [114] on the antidiabetic effect of berberine, a phytochemical from Berberis vulgaris root/rhizome. They reported that at 500 mg/kg body weight in rat, berberine increased insulin secretion, induced glycolysis while also increasing the levels of GLP-1 and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4).",
        "Additionally, studies reported that geniposide from Gardenia jasminoides fruit in INS-1 cells, which secrete insulin, improves glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via the activation of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) and prevents oxidative stress-induced neuron death [103,127]. In vitro, GLP-1 binding to its receptor was enhanced by tarralin, another phytochemical found in Artemisia dracunculus leaves, when given to KK-A (gamma) mice at a dose of 500 mg/kg [105].",
        "According to Singh et al. [28], one possible mechanism for GLP-1 induction by phytochemicals involves activating GLP-1R on the gut’s enteroendocrine cells, which activates many signal transducers, including inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R3), G protein α-gustducin, phospholipase C beta 2 (PLCβ2), and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. These actions depolarize the membrane of the enteroendocrine cell membrane by releasing GLP-1 and increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration.",
        "Several flavonoids have been shown to enhance GLP-1 secretion in intestinal cell models and tissues, leading to increased plasma GLP-1 concentrations in animal studies. Most animal experiments indicate improved glucose tolerance alongside elevated plasma GLP-1 levels. Studies using enteroendocrine cell models such as murine GLUTag and human NCI-H716 cells, curcumin, delphinidin 3-rutinoside, ginsenoside metabolite Rg3, hispidulin, and isoquercitrin demonstrated stimulatory effects on GLP-1 secretion (Table 3) [122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130]. Although less recognized, human Caco2 cells were also used to illustrate EGCG-induced GLP-1 secretion (reference [131]). This study also showcased the GLP-1-releasing activity of EGCG in a mouse intestinal tissue segment model.",
        "In animal experiments, single doses of curcumin [122] and the ginsenoside metabolite Rg3 [129] have been reported to induce GLP-1 secretion. Additionally, chronic administration (either orally or intraperitoneally) of apigenin [133], genistein in combination with metformin [136], hispidulin [126], isoquercitrin [130], luteolin [139], myricetin [138], grape seed proanthocyanidins [135], procyanidin [137], and resveratrol [134] has been reported to increase plasma GLP-1 levels. Some compounds, such as isoquercitrin and myricetin, are reported to inhibit the DPP-4 enzyme, which may contribute to their ability to promote GLP-1 levels [130,138]. Flavonoids exhibit diverse protective effects against obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders by targeting various organs, tissues, and cells, as discussed previously. Therefore, the promotion of GLP-1 by flavonoids may partly underlie their health-promoting effects.",
        "Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, found in several plants like goldenseal and barberry, demonstrated GLP-1R agonist activity in studies, leading to enhanced glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in animal and cell culture models [140]. Berberine induces GLP-1 secretion in the intestine by modulating the gut microbiota, potentially alleviating diabetes symptoms. Additionally, berberine decreases mitochondrial stress and cytochrome c relocation out of the mitochondria. The production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) induced by berberine also contributes to GLP-1 secretion from intestinal L-cells [140].",
        "Extensive research has focused on elucidating how GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) counteract the detrimental effects of ER stress [141], oxidative stress [142], and autophagy [143]. These investigations have identified critical targets necessary for β-cell protection. The proteins identified in Table 4 meet specific criteria for β-cell protection elicited by GLP-1RAs: they are activated and/or induced by GLP-1RAs in β-cells, and their inhibition and/or suppression diminish the protective effects of GLP-1RAs against cell death induced by pro-apoptotic stressors. These proteins form part of the GLP-1RA signaling cascade and are interconnected, as illustrated by the IB1/JIP1/JNK3 pathway [144]. Consequently, targeting these proteins with GLP-1RAs represents a promising therapeutic approach for enhancing β-cell mass in type 2 diabetes.",
        "Traditional medicine or the use of herbs/ medicinal plants in the treatment of diseases is an ancient practice. To date, two ancient traditional medicinal systems stand out; Ayurvedic medicine which is a highly recommended form of medicine in India [151], and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) [152]. Recently, Africa has stepped up the game in coming up with evidence-based traditional medicine; however, there are still limitations.",
        "In Ayurvedic medicine, Madhumeha, one of the four types of Prameha is similar clinically to present-day diabetes mellitus. From the name, “madhu” means sweetness and “meha” means urination [151]. Many local Indian medicinal plants have been said to be a success in the management of diabetes such as Fructus corni (Cornus officinalis), Fructus schisandrae, Rhizoma alismatis, Rhizoma dioscoreae, Gymnema sylvestre (gudmar), Momordica charantia (karela), Pterocarpus marsupium (Beejsar/Vijaysar), Rubia cordifolia, Syzygium cumini (jamun), Brassica juncea, Curcuma longa, Ficus glomerate, Acacia arabica (babul), Aegle marmelos (bael), Agrimonia eupatoria (church steeples), Allium cepa (onion), Allium sativum (garlic), Aloe vera (Ghrit kumari), Azadirachta indica (neem), Beta vulgarus (beetroot), Benincasa hispida (ash gourd), Caesalpinia bonducella (fever nut), Citrullus colocynthis (bitter apple), Coccinia indica (ivy gourd), Eucalyptus globulus (eucalyptus), Ficus benghalensis (banyan tree), Hibiscus rosa chinensis (Gurhal/Jaswandi), Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato), Jatropha curcas (purging nut), Mangifera indica (mango), Morus alba (mulberry), Mucuna pruriens (kiwach), Ocimum sanctum (tulsi), Punica granatum (anar), Tinospora cordifolia (giloy), and Trigonella foenum-graecum (methi) [151].",
        "Phytochemicals from some of these plants have been identified through studies to stimulate GLP-1 secretion such as Momordica charantia [110] and Curcuma longa [132] while some have a GLP-1 receptor agonism property. Cornus officinalis is used in Ayurvedic and TCM in the management of vascular complications of DM and many other diseases. Xu et al. reported that a secoiridoid glycoside named Morroniside from the plant activates GLP-1 receptor [153] and Park et al. reported its effect on diabetes-induced alterations [154].",
        "According to TCM general principles, diabetes impairs “qi (energy/life-force)” causing reduced circulatory system function. The spleen, in TCM, is the source of vital energy and blood and it controls its circulation; weakness to the spleen’s qi spirals down to damage kidney endothelial cells and eventually produces renal fibrosis. Therefore, in treating diabetes, qi and circulatory function must be improved; hence, most prescribed formulations are spleen strengtheners (156). One common formula used in TCM in treating diabetes is Rehmannia Six Formula (RF) which contains six herbs; Rehmannia glutinosa, Fructus corni, Dioscorea, Poria cocos, Alisma and Paeonia suffruticosa. Of all the herbs, Fructus corni is the only plant with a compound able to activate the GLP-1 receptor. Also, Tang et al. reported that Wenyujinoside and 28-deglucosylchikusetsusaponin IV could activate GLP-1 receptor for DM treatment [155]. Wenyujinoside is from Curcuma wenyujin [156] while 28-deglucosylchikusetsusaponin IV is from Panax japonicus [157].",
        "Mohammed and Tajuddeen reported that about 82 compounds from 24 different plants across Africa were studied over 5 years (2015–2020). Some of the compounds include quercetin, epicatechin, protocatechuic acid, kolaviron, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and lupeol while some of the plants include Aframomum melegueta (Nigeria), Antidesma madagascariense (Madagascar), Leonotis ocymifolia (Namibia), Myrianthus arboreus (Ghana), and Ziziphus mucronate (South Africa) [158]. Preparation of the plants usually involves boiling fresh leaves or stems in the form of tea, extracting the juice from the leaves to take orally, dried fruit or seed ground into powder to take with pap [158]. Various studies suggested the mechanism of action for these compounds in the management of DM; however, none was reported to be a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Continuing research on local plants with antidiabetic potential, especially to elucidate their mechanism of action, and then advancing from preclinical results to clinical trials with financial support from the relevant industries and the Government would go a long way to help African traditional medicine.",
        "Medicinal plants are being used worldwide, especially by those who consider them the most readily available and the cheapest. However, they are not yet accepted by all, based on several schools of thought, some of which may be true or false. T2DM remains a multifactorial disease which will need a combination of multi-targeted molecules as treatment. The use of medicinal plants would be a better approach in solving this dilemma, especially with further intensive research and policies being put in place to make it more widely accepted and not just seen as an alternative.",
        "Although these phytochemicals have shown potential effects on the glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in experimental models, their specific mechanisms of action and interactions with GLP-1R signaling may differ and warrant additional investigation. Introducing a variety of phytochemical-rich foods into one’s diet could provide advantages for metabolic health; however, further studies are necessary to comprehensively grasp their therapeutic implications for conditions such as diabetes and obesity.",

    "title": "Dietary carbohydrate restriction as the first approach in diabetes management: critical review and evidence base. specific failure of the prevailing low-fat diets to improve obesity, cardiovascular risk, or general health and the persistent reports of some serious side effects of commonly prescribed diabetic medications, in combination with the continued success of low-carbohydrate diets in the treatment of diabetes and metabolic syndrome without significant side effects, point to the need for a reappraisal of dietary guidelines. The benefits of carbohydrate restriction in diabetes are immediate and well documented. Concerns about the efficacy and safety are long term and conjectural rather than data driven. Dietary carbohydrate restriction reliably reduces high blood glucose, does not require weight loss (although is still best for weight loss), and leads to the reduction or elimination of medication. It has never shown side effects comparable with those seen in many drugs. Here we present 12 points of evidence supporting the use of low-carbohydrate diets as the first approach to treating type 2 diabetes and as the most effective adjunct to pharmacology in type 1. They represent the best-documented, least controversial results. The insistence on long-term randomized controlled trials as the only kind of data that will be accepted is without precedent in science. The seriousness of diabetes requires that we evaluate all of the evidence that is available. The 12 points are sufficiently compelling that we feel that the burden of proof rests with those who are opposed. Center, Brooklyn, New York, USA. Electronic address: richard.feinman@downstate.edu.

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing low-fat, Mediterranean, ketogenic, low-carbohydrate, high-protein, vegetarian, intermittent fasting, and DASH diets.

In 2021, there were 612 million cases of CVD globally, accounting for 26.8% of all deaths3 highlighting the urgent need for effective preventive strategies. CVD often strikes acutely, primarily due to blood clots or blockages that restrict blood flow to the heart or brain, resulting in irreversible damage, so prevention is the most cost-effective strategy for reducing its harm.",
        "Epidemiological evidence has established hypertension, diabetes, and obesity as modifiable risk determinants for CVD pathogenesis4. Current clinical guidelines (e.g., American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology) have identified dietary modification as a core strategy for primary prevention and secondary management of CVD4,5. With advancing research on obesity and hypertensive diseases, various dietary patterns have been proposed to prevent or mitigate associated metabolic abnormalities.",
        "Recent advances have validated multiple dietary patterns for reducing the risk of CVD, although their relative effectiveness remains controversial. Although low-fat diets (LFD) have historically been the dominant recommended approach for lipid management, large randomized trials have shown that their impact on CVD outcomes is limited6. In contrast, Mediterranean diet (MED), rich in monounsaturated fats, polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids, demonstrates pleiotropic benefits including systolic blood pressure and anti-inflammatory effects, as evidenced by the landmark PREDIMED trial7.",
        "Similarly, high-protein diets (HPD) and ketogenic diets (KD) show promise for weight loss and insulin sensitivity enhancement8–10 yet KD’s long-term cardiovascular safety remains debated due to potential lipid profile alterations11–14. Moreover, low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) aim to reduce body weight by limiting carbohydrate intake to less than 20%. However, such diets usually increase the intake of saturated fatty acids, which may elevate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and thus their effects on cardiovascular disease deserve further study15.",
        "In contrast, DASH diet, recommended for individuals with hypertension, helps prevent CVD by lowering blood pressure16. Vegetarian diet, by limiting meat consumption and promoting the intake of fruits and vegetables, is effective in reducing obesity incidence17,18. And intermittent fasting (IF) achieves rapid weight loss19.",
        "Despite accumulating evidence, critical knowledge gaps obstruct clinical translation. Existing meta-analyses rely predominantly on pairwise comparisons20 failing to provide cross-modal evaluations of heterogeneous dietary interventions. This limitation prevents personalized recommendations for distinct cardiovascular risk profiles. To address this gap, we conducted the first NMA comparing eight major dietary patterns—LFD, MED, KD, LCD, HPD, Vegetarian, IF, and DASH—against control diets (CD). By quantifying their differential effects on body composition, lipid profiles, glycemic markers, and blood pressure, this study aims to guide precision nutrition strategies for targeted CVD risk management.",

        "As the first comprehensive NMA comparing eight prevalent dietary patterns against customary diets, this study provides novel insights into their differential impacts on CVD biomarkers. CVD remains a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, characterized by acute onset and substantial disease burden. Substantial evidence identifies modifiable metabolic derangements—including obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension—alongside suboptimal lifestyle behaviors as pivotal CVD risk determinants43. The burgeoning popularity of IF for weight management40 has prompted scientific inquiry into whether such dietary strategies could effectively mitigate CVD risk through metabolic optimization. Our findings reveal a nuanced landscape: While no universal dietary solution emerged, customary diets demonstrated inferiority across most outcomes. Notably, KD and HPD showed superior efficacy for weight and BMI reduction, whereas KD and LCD excelled in waist circumference management. Blood pressure control was optimally achieved through DASH and IF interventions. Lipid profile improvements exhibited diet-specific patterns: KD and HPD for TG and TC reduction; LCD and LFD for HDL-C elevation; KD and LCD for LDL-C lowering. Glycemic control was most effectively attained through DASH and LCD regimens.",
        "Obesity, a well-established modifiable risk factor for CVD, exerts its detrimental effects through pathological adipose tissue expansion. This process drives the secretion of pro-inflammatory adipokines that induce insulin resistance, accelerate atherosclerosis, and ultimately potentiate cardiovascular dysfunction. Our NMA identified KD as the optimal intervention for body composition regulation, demonstrating superior efficacy in reducing body weight (MD −10.5 kg), BMI (−3.57 kg/m²), and waist circumference (−5.13 cm) compared to CD. These findings align with recent clinical recommendations by Bellanti et al.44. who advocate very low-calorie KD protocols for obesity management. Another study on gut flora also showed that the KD reduced the abundance of the gut bacterium Lactobacillus murinus ASF361, which encodes bile salt hydrolase (BSH). The reduction of ASF361 or the inhibition of BSH activity increased circulating levels of taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) and taurosugar deoxycholic acid (TUDCA), which in turn reduce energy absorption by inhibiting intestinal carbonic anhydrase 1 expression, leading to weight loss45. Furthermore, the effects of HPD on weight and BMI control have also been demonstrated in several studies, where high-protein diets not only increased satiety but also facilitated the maintenance of fat-free mass, which is closely related to the body’s resting energy expenditure, and high-protein diets increased the body’s resting energy expenditure through the maintenance or increase of fat-free mass, which was effective in reducing body weight46.",
        "Hypertension remains a pivotal modifiable risk factor in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. The DASH diet, specifically designed to combat elevated blood pressure, demonstrates superior antihypertensive efficacy through its dual mechanisms of sodium restriction and nutrient optimization. Our NMA corroborates these established benefits while revealing an unexpected finding: IF exhibits comparable blood pressure-lowering effects (SBP reduction: −5.98 mmHg vs. control). This observation aligns with the systematic evidence synthesis by Chanthawat Patikorn et al.47whose study identified consistent blood pressure improvements across IF interventions. Mechanistically, IF enhances parasympathetic activation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated cholinergic neurotransmission. Elevated BDNF levels potentiate acetylcholine synthesis in vagal neurons, which subsequently binds to muscarinic receptors in the sinoatrial node to reduce heart rate47. Concurrently, acetylcholine induces nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation in peripheral vasculature, collectively contributing to blood pressure normalization48. These neurohumoral modulations position IF as a complementary non-pharmacological strategy to DASH dietary protocols, offering synergistic pathways for cardiovascular risk mitigation.",
        "Glycemic dyslipidemia was associated with many chronic diseases and promotes the development of cardiovascular disease. Our study showed that the HPD and the KD were effective in reducing TG, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies, mainly due to restriction of dietary carbohydrate intake49. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is often considered the “good” cholesterol because of its key protective role in cardiovascular health. The primary function of HDL-C is reverse cholesterol transport, i.e., the transport of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues such as the arterial wall back to the liver for metabolism and elimination, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerosis. Our study showed that LCD diet and LFD diet were optimal in increasing HDL-C, which is consistent with the results of a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of dietary patterns and risk factors for cardiovascular disease by Chio Yokose et al.50. In addition our study showed that the DASH diet and LCD diet were optimal for glycemic reduction, which is not in line with previous reports in the literature, as the meta-analysis by Abolfazl Lari et al. showed no significant effect of the DASH diet on glycemia51which may be due to the fact that only one of the studies on the DASH diet that we included reported on the effect on glycemia, which may be due to publication bias and thus a risk factor for the results. The effect of the LCD diet on glycemic control is in line with previous studies, and in a review by Richard D Feinman et al. 12 points of evidence were given to recommend a low-carbohydrate diet as the first diet for glycemic control52. For TC and LDL-C our study did not find a significant difference between these dietary patterns and the habitual diet, but both were on the trend of improvement.",
        "Traditional nutrition RCTs often focus on single-nutrient interventions (e.g., reducing fat intake or supplementing specific vitamins)53. However, this approach has notable limitations. For instance, the early “cholesterol hypothesis” overemphasized fat restriction to reduce cardiovascular risk, yet ignored that excessive limitation could lead to deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (e.g., vitamins D, E, K)54 and essential fatty acids (e.g., ω−3), ultimately posing adverse health effects. In contrast, dietary pattern highlight the synergistic effects of multiple foods and nutrients. Research indicates that the collective health benefits of dietary patterns significantly exceed the sum of isolated nutrient actions55. Taking Mediterranean diet as an example: Mediterranean diet has been known for its richness in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, olive oil and fish, as well as moderate amounts of dairy and poultry, and limiting red meat and processed foods56. It reduces LDL-C and TG levels while elevating HDL-C, as well as increasing adiponectin concentration and suppresses inflammatory responses. These changes help reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation and arterial stiffness56.",
        "Overall, different dietary patterns may lead to a reduced or increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease by influencing different cardiovascular risk factors. In our study, the KD diet demonstrated superior outcomes on a variety of measures. The KD diet was originally developed for the treatment of epilepsy and is characterized by a very low carbohydrate intake, a high fat intake, and approximately 20% protein57. Despite its effectiveness, this diet has been controversial due to the negative perception of fat and its potential risk for cardiovascular disease. Some studies have shown that the KD diet does not significantly alter lipid levels58whereas others have reported an increase in LDL cholesterol59which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease60 However, randomized controlled trials have also demonstrated that the KD diet reduces LDL cholesterol, cholesterol levels, body weight, and blood pressure46. Furthermore, it may prevent cardiovascular disease by stabilizing the vascular endothelial system8. More research is needed to resolve the current debate surrounding the KD diet. It is critical to seek guidance from a qualified dietitian on how to appropriately implement a KD diet for CVD prevention and weight loss. Of course, in clinical practice it may be necessary to select the most appropriate intervention strategy based on the goals.",
        "This study has several limitations. First, the inclusion criteria did not stratify participants based on age, gender, or disease duration, which may have influenced the effects of the dietary patterns. Second, while a NMA was conducted, the relatively small sample sizes and limited number of included studies may have reduced the statistical power of the results. In addition, the mediating effect of weight change was not assessed, and different dietary patterns may work together to improve cardiovascular risk through metabolic modulation (e.g., ketone body production, fatty acid oxidation) and weight-dependent pathways, which needs to be further elucidated in longitudinal studies combined with biomarker analysis. Lastly, the search was restricted to English-language databases, which may have introduced selection bias and limited the comprehensiveness of the findings.",
        "This paper summarizes and ranks the effects of commonly used dietary patterns on CVD risk factors. The results of the NMA suggest that the KD and LCD are optimal for managing body composition, while the DASH diet and IF are most effective for controlling blood pressure. For dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia, the LCD and HPD may offer better outcomes. All three diets—KD, LCD, and HPD—restrict carbohydrate intake, and this restriction appears to be beneficial in preventing CVD. These findings can guide clinicians in providing dietary recommendations for individuals at high risk of CVD.",

        "Diabetes may have been recognized more than 3000 years ago [1], and the incidence and prevalence of this ancient disease have increased with improvements in living and health standards. Currently, 1 in 11 people has diabetes, which is 4 times more frequent than 30 years ago [2]. In addition to eye, kidney, and foot disease, chronic hyperglycaemia can damage the myocardium, which manifests as diabetic cardiomyopathy. The pathology of diabetic cardiomyopathy includes abnormal carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism, microvascular disease, endothelial dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, myocardial diastolic dysfunction and fibrosis, excessive cardiomyocyte programmed cell death, increased oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and glycotoxicity [3–5]. Adverse responses to abnormal blood glucose lead to structural remodelling and impaired function in the heart. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is known to significantly increase the risk of heart failure and can lead to a preserved or reduced ejection fraction [6].",
        "Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have long been used as drugs to treat diabetes and have recently been shown to improve cardiac function in diabetes. In a randomized controlled trial, dapagliflozin reduced heart failure by 27% in T2DM (type 2 diabetes mellitus) patients with cardiovascular disease. The effectiveness was 35% for empagliflozin and 33% for canagliflozin [7]. This review focuses on the benefits of SGLT2i for cardiomyopathy in diabetes, including the mechanism (Table 1).

        "Therapeutic targets of SGLT2i in basic science trials",
        "The first SGLT inhibitor was dihydrochalcone phlorizin, which is a nonselective SGLT inhibitor extracted from apple tree roots [8]. Dihydrochalcone phlorizin contains a glucose moiety and an aglycone in which two aromatic carbocycles are joined by an alkyl spacer. Later, the aromatic O-glycoside sergliflozin and the aromatic C-glycoside dapagliflozin officially opened the era of selective SGLT inhibitors [9]. The available SGLT2i are functionally similar but differ in selectivity, efficacy, and indication. For example, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin are 2600, 1200, and 150 times more selective for SGLT2 than for SGLT1 [10]. Ipragliflozin and dapagliflozin were approved to treat T1DM (type 1 diabetes mellitus) and T2DM, but most other SGLT2i were approved to treat only T2DM [10]. There are also some obvious differences among them; for example, compared with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, canagliflozin has a stronger inhibitory effect on angiogenesis [11, 12].",
        "The ways in which SGLT2 functions in the heart are not fully understood. SGLT1 is expressed by cardiomyocytes and may be a target of SGLT2i that improves heart failure [13]. Inhibiting SGLT1 with canagliflozin was shown to reduce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity in cardiomyocytes, thereby inhibiting the production of superoxide and decreasing inflammation [13]. SGLT2i may be useful as a first-line treatment for heart failure that is not only mediated by their target receptors. For example, dapagliflozin and canagliflozin were reported to directly inhibit Na+/H+ exchanger-1 (NHE1) and abrogate the increase in cytosolic Na+ in cardiomyocytes. Direct activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by dapagliflozin could reduce lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced myocardial fibrosis. That kind of intermolecular interaction is not dependent on SGLT2i-mediated inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter [14]. Other studies have shown that the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 was a target of SGLT2i and that inhibiting sodium channels ameliorated dysfunctional sodium and calcium homeostasis, improved calcium overload, and decreased the incidence of malignant arrhythmias [15]. Ongoing study of SGLT2i is expected to reveal additional mechanisms of action.",
        "Disorders of glucose and fatty acid metabolism are prominent features of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Under normal conditions, fatty acids are the first-choice energy source and account for 70–90% of the ATP produced by cardiomyocytes. Although each molecule of fatty acid produces more ATP than glucose, complete oxidation requires more oxygen. When the same amount of oxygen is consumed, fatty acids produce less ATP than glucose (2.33 vs. 2.58) [16]. However, compared with the absence of diabetes, oxidative metabolism in cardiomyocytes under diabetic conditions consumes a higher percentage of fatty acids and a lower percentage of glucose [17], and there is an increase in the use of ketone bodies [18]. The presence of diabetes increases oxygen consumption and decreases efficiency in the heart [17].",
        "Evidence of the regulation of glucose uptake and utilization by SGLT2i may provide ideas for further research. The glucose transporter (GLUT) isoforms GLUT4 and GLUT1 are predominant in the heart [19]. The mechanism of action is not known, but data show that SGLT2i benefit myocardial energy metabolism. Empagliflozin has been shown to increase glucose uptake in the human and murine myocardium that was associated with increased GLUT1 expression [20]. Empagliflozin was also reported to increase glycolysis and glucose oxidation rates in the myocardium of db/db mice [21].",
        "The dominant carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase (CPT) isoform in the heart is CPT1b. It is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and catalyses carnitine conjugation of long-chain fatty acids, which facilitates mitochondrial transport and β-oxidation in cardiomyocytes [22]. In a rat diabetes model, CPT1b expression in myocardial tissues was significantly increased compared with that in nondiabetic controls. As previously stated, increased fatty acid utilization increases the oxygen requirements of cardiomyocytes. However, the mRNA and protein expression of CPT1b was reduced by subcutaneous injection of empagliflozin [23], which indicates that SGLT2i improved cardiomyocyte energy metabolism by reducing fatty acid utilization.",
        "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a superfamily of nuclear receptor proteins that act as transcription factors and have at least three isoforms: α, δ and γ. Empagliflozin inhibits the mRNA and protein expression of PPAR-γ in the kidney [24]. Most likely because of the same effect, it decreases the expression of CD36, which is the downstream molecule of PPAR-γ, in cardiac tissue [25] and reduces the uptake and accumulation of fatty acids [26]. When activated, PPAR-α promotes the use of fatty acids and reduces the use of glucose [27]. SGLT2i do not directly decrease PPAR-α mRNA expression in the myocardium [23] but promote PPAR-α mRNA and protein expression in adipose tissue and decrease the concentrations of triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) in plasma [28]. Adiponectin is a peptide that is secreted by adipocytes, and its effects on lipid metabolism are reflected by a negative correlation with serum TG and association with increased utilization of glucose and fatty acids by muscle tissue [29]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that SGLT2i increased adiponectin levels in T2DM [30]. It has been proven that abnormal TC and TG levels are closely related to diabetes [31]. The control of lipid metabolism not only helps to prevent cardiovascular events but also improves left ventricle systolic dysfunction [32, 33].",
        "Fatty acids and glucose are the major fuels in the normal heart. Ketone bodies are a minor energy source. In diabetes patients, insulin resistance decreases glucose transport and availability as an energy source. As a result, cardiomyocytes increase their utilization of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) [18]. SGLT2i have been shown to increase myocardial utilization of ketone bodies to increase ATP production. Verma et al. [21] showed that overall cardiac ATP production was 36% lower in db/db mice than in C57BL/6 J mice and that empagliflozin increased cardiac ATP production by 31% compared with that in untreated db/db mice. Strangely, empagliflozin did not directly improve the efficiency of myocardial ketone body utilization. However, it has been reported that empagliflozin can increase serum ketone concentrations by activating the expression of the ketogenic enzyme HMGCS2 in other tissues [34]. Moreover, the frugal fuel hypothesis suggests that an increase in ketone body concentration is responsible for the increased efficiency of cardiac mitochondrial oxidation in response to empagliflozin [35, 36]. In a subsequent experiment on the perfusion of isolated mouse hearts, researchers found that the addition of β-OHB to the system produced effects similar to those observed in response to empagliflozin. Therefore, we can conclude that empagliflozin increases blood ketone concentrations, thereby increasing overall ketone utilization. This result was subsequently confirmed by a similar study [37].",
        "Aerobic respiration that occurs in the mitochondria of cardiomyocytes provides energy for cardiac contraction. Mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in diabetic cardiomyopathy as a consequence of high glucose, insulin resistance, and obesity. The consequences of these pathological changes include but are not limited to increased mitochondrial fission, autophagy, reduced oxidative phosphorylation and impaired ATP production, the accumulation of metabolic intermediates and reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, apoptosis, and impaired mechanical function in the heart [38–40].",
        "Mitochondria frequently divide and fuse with each other [41]. When cells are subjected to mild stress, mitochondria form an extensive interconnected network. When cells are severely stressed, mitochondria undergo fission and are fragmented [42]. In response to hyperglycaemia, cardiomyocyte mitochondria undergo dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated fission, which, if excessive, can result in fragmentation, ROS production, increased oxidative stress and even cell death [43]. Tanajak et al. [44] studied the inhibitory effect of SGLT2i on excessive mitochondrial fission after cardiac ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in the hearts of obese rats with high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance. Dapagliflozin reversed the impairment in mitochondrial morphology and increased ROS levels. The total myocardial Drp1 protein level did not change significantly, but the myocardial mitochondrial Drp1 level decreased significantly [44]. The myocardial phosphorylation site Drp1 Ser-637 was activated by dapagliflozin, which may have accounted for the reduction in the mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 [45]. These data are consistent with those of Zhou et al. [46], who reported that the upstream signalling molecule of Drp1 was AMPK. Mitochondrial fusion and fission are also associated with mitofusins (MFNs) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1). MFN1 and MFN2 mediate fusion of the mitochondrial outer membrane, OPA1 mediates inner membrane fusion [47], and the absence of any one of the three causes cells to produce different types of fragmented mitochondria [48, 49]. Therefore, MFNs and OPA1 are targets of SGLT2i therapy. Durak et al. [50] reported that dapagliflozin normalized the increase in MFN1, decrease in MFN2, and increase in OPA1 expression in the myocardium of rats with sucrose-induced metabolic syndrome. These results have also been reported for empagliflozin [51] (Fig. 1).Fig. 1SGLT2 inhibitors improve mitochondrial function. SGLT2 inhibitors activate the AMPK/PGC-1α signalling pathway, thereby increasing PGC-1α-regulated NRF-1 expression, which increases mtTFA expression and further promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1α can also inhibit Drp1-induced mitochondrial fission and activate key enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase, in mitochondria, which can increase the efficiency of electron transfer. Activation of AMPK, on the other hand, leads to the recovery of abnormal MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1, reducing mitochondrial fission",

Activation of AMPK, on the other hand, leads to the recovery of abnormal MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1, reducing mitochondrial fission",
        "Mitochondrial biogenesis and the growth and division of preexisting mitochondria are regulated by AMPK, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), and nuclear respiratory factors (NRF)-1 and -2 [52]. AMPK activation was shown to increase the transcription of the PGC-1α gene in rat cell nuclei, which then induced the expression of the transcription factor NRF-1 [53]. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) is a mitochondrial promoter that stimulates transcription. The proximal promoter of the human mtTFA gene is dependent on the activity of the recognition sites of the nuclear respiratory factors NRF-1 and NRF-2 [54]. Activation of PGC-1α, NRF-1, and mtTFA increases the transcription and replication of mitochondrial DNA. PGC-1α can also activate the expression of key enzymes in mitochondria, including cytochrome c oxidase [55]. This will allow the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) to increase the efficiency of electronic transfer. These regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis are inhibited to varying degrees in diabetes. However, empagliflozin reversed the downregulation of PGC-1α, NRF-1, and mtTFA in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of T2DM [51] (Fig. 1).",
        "The transfer of electrons in the ETC generates mitochondrial membrane potential. The reduced activity of ETC complexes in the hearts of diabetes patients is accompanied by a reduction in the mitochondrial respiration rate [56]. The decreases in mitochondrial state 3 respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential in rats with STZ-induced diabetes were reversed by high-dose empagliflozin [51]. Secker et al. [57] found that canagliflozin inhibited the activity of mitochondrial respiratory complex I and promoted complex II activity, and empagliflozin and dapagliflozin increased the activity of complex I. Improvements in mitochondrial function by SGLT2i may be related to a decrease in O-GlcNAcylation. The increase in O-GlcNAcylation secondary to hyperglycaemia leads to a decrease in the activity of ETC complexes I, III, and IV. This change is mainly due to the O-GlcNAcylated subunits that make up the respiratory chain complexes [58]. Dapagliflozin and other SGLT2i may improve the function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by directly reducing O-GlcNAc transferase activity and O-GlcNAcylation [59].",
        "Diabetes is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular events and cause myocardial microvascular complications [60, 61]. Damage to vascular endothelial cells caused by oxidative stress is followed by a series of pathological changes that include vascular inflammation, vasoconstriction, thrombosis and atherosclerosis [62]. Diabetes and glycotoxicity promote coronary atherosclerosis by exacerbating endothelial dysfunction and increasing oxidative stress, blood lipids, and autonomic dysfunction [63].",
        "Vascular inflammation is mediated in part by mitochondrial fission, which is a complex mechanism involving tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Drp-1, NF-κB, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) [64]. Primary cultures of rat aortic endothelial cells transduced with an adenovirus encoding a dominant-negative Drp1K38A mutant showed significant inhibition of TNF-α-induced NF-κB-driven promoter activity and VCAM-1 induction. These factors are responsible for chronic persistent inflammation and atherosclerosis [65]. SGLT2i were reported to improve endothelial function in mice with STZ-induced diabetes by inhibiting abnormal mitochondrial fission and endothelial inflammation [46]. The anti-inflammatory effect of empagliflozin on arterial endothelial cells has been linked to the activation of AMPK and inhibition of Drp1 by the phosphorylation of Ser-637 [66].",
        "Macrophage infiltration and polarization towards the M1 phenotype are key events in the development of atherosclerosis [67]. Macrophages can polarize to two phenotypes: M1 and M2. M1 macrophages exacerbate the inflammatory response, and M2 macrophages are involved in the resolution of inflammation [68]. In a mouse model of diabetes with atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia, empagliflozin decreased the proliferation of plaque-resident macrophages and reduced the size of atherosclerotic plaques [69]. The mechanism involved reducing M1 phenotype polarization and increasing M2 polarization in response to SGLT2i [70].",
        "SGLT2i have also been reported to delay endothelial cell senescence, and the effect may depend on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R). Angiotensin II induces endothelial senescence [71], and Khemais-Benkhiat et al.[72] reported that hyperglycaemia increased the protein expression of ACE and AT1R and increased β-galactosidase, a biomarker of cellular senescence[73], in porcine coronary endothelial cells. Empagliflozin reversed these changes in the presence of hyperglycaemia but did not affect ACE or AT1R in control cells in the absence of hyperglycaemia [72].",
        "Hyperuricaemia is another independent risk factor for diabetes. Uric acid levels increase in the early stages of impaired glucose metabolism, and hyperuricaemia is associated with micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes [74, 75]. Uric acid concentrations higher than physiological levels inhibit NO synthesis, reduce NO activity and induce NF-κB, leading to the induction of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), which mediate inflammation and atherosclerosis [76]. Chino et al. [77] found that the SGLT2i luseogliflozin increased uric acid excretion and that GLUT9 isoform 2 was involved. SGLT2i increased the concentration of glucose in the proximal tubule, which caused GLUT9 isoform 2 and other transporters to reabsorb more glucose and excrete more uric acid. In the collecting ducts, a high concentration of glucose prevents GLUT9 isoform 2 from reabsorbing uric acid (Fig. 2).Fig. 2SGLT2i can improve vasodilatory inflammation by decreasing uric acid levels. In proximal renal tubules, SGLT2i acts on SGLT2, decreasing the reabsorption of Na ions and glucose and increasing glucose concentrations in the lumen, which is exchanged with uric acid by GLUT9 isoform 2. This leads to increased uric acid exclusion. In the collecting duct, high levels of glucose inhibit this exchange and reduce the absorption of uric acid, thereby draining it. Lowering the concentration of uric acid in the blood helps reduce inflammation in the blood vessels",

        "Studies have shown that flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is reduced in young T2DM patients relative to healthy individuals [78], and in coronary arteries, the maximal pharmacologic flow reserve is significantly lower in diabetes patients than in healthy individuals [79]. Dapagliflozin has been shown to improve FMD in patients with T2DM [80], which may depend on the inhibition of COX-2. The increase in ROS production may involve COX-2/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)/E-type prostaglandin receptor 4 (EP4)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)/NADPH oxidase isoform 4 (Nox4) signalling [81]. Increased ROS resulting in vasoconstriction involves the initiation of calcium flux and stimulating pathways leading to the sensitization of contractile elements to calcium [82]. Therefore, this kind of vasoconstriction can be inhibited by selective COX-2 inhibitors. SGLT2i inhibit COX-2 mRNA expression and vasoconstriction [83]. Vasodilation caused by selective COX-2 inhibitors was attenuated in genetically obese Zucker rats because the production of the vasodilator PGE2 promoted by COX-2 in the endothelium was attenuated [84]. COX-2 inhibition can thus improve vasodilation over a limited range (Fig. 3).Fig. 3SGLT2i can improve vasodilatory functions through COX-2. In endothelial cells, SGLT2i inhibit the production of ROS-induced PGH2 by inhibiting COX-2 and reduce the production of PGE2 and TXA2 downstream of PGH2. In vascular smooth muscle, although PGE2 activates EP4 receptors to dilate blood vessels, TAX2 activates TP receptors to cause vasoconstriction. In addition, downstream EP4 can cascade into ERK1/2/NOX4 to produce ROS, which contributes to vasoconstriction and the activation of COX-2. In vascular smooth muscle, COX-2 activates and catalyses AA to produce PGH2, which constricts blood vessels",

        "Voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channels regulate membrane resting potential and vascular tone. The opening of smooth muscle Kv channels results in hyperpolarization and vasodilation [85]. Dapagliflozin activates Kv channels by directly activating protein kinase G (PKG) independent of guanylyl cyclase, resulting in endothelial-independent vascular smooth muscle relaxation [86]. This kind of PKG/Kv channel signalling is effective and feasible [87]. TNF-α levels are elevated in T2DM and may impair insulin signalling and lead to insulin resistance [88]. Uthman et al. [89] reported that dapagliflozin and empagliflozin inhibited TNFα-induced ROS generation in human coronary arterial endothelial cells, and the subsequent decrease in NO consumption was responsible for improved blood vessel dilatation. An increase in L-arginine synthesis may indirectly improve coronary flow reserves by increasing NO synthesis. L-arginine is a substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which converts arginine to NO. An increase in L-arginine synthesis in the kidneys and an increase in NO bioavailability in response to SGLT2i were reported to increase coronary flow velocity reserve in an ob/ob − / − mouse model [90]. SGLT2i may act directly on cardiomyocyte NHE1 to reduce cytosolic Na+. Empagliflozin and canagliflozin significantly decreased coronary perfusion pressure in isolated C57 mouse hearts under constant-flow conditions, which was consistent with the dilation of coronary vessels [91].",
        "The microvascular complications of diabetes include a reduction in the density of arterioles on the surface of the heart and have also been described in animal models of diabetes [92, 93].",
        "Some SGLT2i promote angiogenesis. For example, empagliflozin significantly reduced the loss of CD31 + microvessels and decreased the size of defects in zones of perfusion in diabetes model mice [46]. In the model, empagliflozin activated AMPK via an increased AMP/ATP ratio that then led to the failure of Drp1 recruitment to the mitochondria and weakened mitochondrial fission. The resulting reduction in ROS production alleviated cell senescence and decreased F-actin dissolution into G-actin, which contributed to cardiac microvascular endothelial cell migration and neovascularization.",
        "Unfortunately, some SGLT2i inhibit angiogenesis. For example, canagliflozin inhibited the in vitro proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and the formation of blood vessels in allograft liver tumours [11]. Canagliflozin also inhibited angiogenesis in the lower limbs of mice with diabetes and lower limb ischaemia by inhibiting the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A by bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and reducing the proliferation and migration of mesenchymal stem cells [12].",
        "Myocardial fibrosis occurs in cardiomyopathy associated with diabetes, and it involves the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) [94] and increased myocardial stiffness that interferes with ventricular diastole. Chronic hyperglycaemia is accompanied by the formation of AGEs that are produced by the nonenzymatic combination of glucose and proteins. Activation of the receptor for AGE (RAGE) by AGEs promotes the proliferation, function, and migration of cardiac fibroblasts, which exacerbates myocardial fibrosis and accelerates cardiac ageing [94–96]. AGEs, RAGE and downstream protein kinase C (PKC)-ζ and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) promote tissue fibrosis. Activation of the MAPK subfamily ERK is the most significant event in this process. After being activated, ERK translocates to the nucleus, where it influences transcription factors such as cAMP-response element binding protein, ETS domain-containing protein-1 and Y-box binding protein-1 to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix accumulation [94, 97, 98]. Empagliflozin can inhibit the AGE/RAGE axis in the kidney, and it is believed that evidence in the heart will follow [99].",
        "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) also regulates tissue fibrosis via the SMAD protein, which is an intracellular effector downstream of the TGF-β receptor. Epithelial-myofibroblast transition and collagen expression are promoted by SMAD2 and SMAD3 and inhibited by SMAD7 [100, 101]. A recent study showed that myocardial fibrosis was improved by SGLT2i [102]. In a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, myocardial expression of collagen I and collagen III proteins and connective tissue fraction was increased compared with that in nondiabetic mice and was partially reversed by empagliflozin [102]. TGF-β/SMAD signalling was involved because, compared with that in untreated mice, the expression of TGF-β1, p-Smad2, and p-Smad3 in the heart tissue of mice treated with empagliflozin was significantly reduced (Fig. 4). Other studies have shown that blocking NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) reduced myocardial fibrosis [103]. Interleukin (IL)-1β promotes TGF-β gene expression and promotes fibrosis through the TGF-β pathway. Other reasons involve nonpolymeric NLRP3 protein, but the mechanism is not very clear [104]. The TGF-β pathway is discussed in the pyroptosis section of this review (Fig. 5).Fig. 4Histological data on the improvements in myocardial fibrosis by empagliflozin [102]. SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin played an important role in improving myocardial fibrosis of diabetic mice (genetic type 2 diabetes model) through reducing the expression of relevant signaling molecules and collagen. Compared with diabetic mice without empagliflozin treatment, it significantly reduced the expression of TGF-β1, p-Smad2, p-Smad3, collagen I, and collagen III.

Activation of AMPK by the SGLT2 inhibitor decreases the expression of downstream NLRP3, Caspase-1 and ACS. Therefore, the upregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex is inhibited, which reduces the transformation of procaspase-1 to active caspase-1 and the transformation of proIL-1β and proIL-18 to IL-1β and IL-18, respectively, to inhibit pyroptosis. As a result of the decrease in IL-1β, the activation of IL-1βR is correspondingly decreased, and the expression of TGF-β in the downstream signalling pathway is reduced, resulting in a relative reduction in fibrosis",

        "Diabetes increases the risk of myocardial infarction [60], and the infarct size is larger in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes [105]. SGLT2i have been shown to improve ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction and to alleviate cardiac fibrosis by modulating macrophage polarization. The mechanism is similar to that for atherosclerosis, as previously discussed. Studies have shown that in the postmortem myocardium, IL-10 can indirectly affect fibroblast activation by stimulating M2 macrophage polarization, thereby significantly reducing the level of collagen I, reducing the ratio of collagen I to collagen III in cardiac fibroblasts, and reducing collagen accumulation in the infarcted area of the mouse heart [106]. The increase in collagen I leads to increased fibril width and stiffness [107]. The effect of SGLT2i on this pathway was demonstrated by Lee et al. [108], who found that dapagliflozin induced macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype and inhibited the M1 phenotype by stimulating signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling in mice with myocardial infarction and attenuated the increase in collagen after infarction.",
        "The effect of diabetes on ventricular diastolic dysfunction may be related to a reduction in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and a decrease in PKG activity because of increased nitrosative and oxidative stress and decreased bioavailability of NO [109, 110]. Oxidative and nitrosative stress caused by diabetes are discussed later in this review. PKG phosphorylates N2BA and N2B, the two main cardiac titin isoforms in the human left ventricle, resulting in a decrease in cardiomyofibrillar stiffness [111]. In human myocardial tissue from patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and ZDF obese rats, PKGIα was oxidized and was present as a dimer or polymer in the cardiomyocyte cell membrane. Empagliflozin decreased PKGIα oxidation and translocation of the reduced form into the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes. Empagliflozin restored the damaged NO/soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)/cGMP/PKG pathway in the HFpEF myocardium, significantly increased NO and cGMP concentrations, and increased sGC and PKGIα activity [112], which reduced cardiomyocyte stiffness. These changes were observed macroscopically. Echocardiography after intravenous injection of empagliflozin revealed significantly improved diastolic ventricular function in HFpEF rats and in humans [113].",
        "Oxidative stress results from an imbalance in oxidative and antioxidative activity, and an excess of intermediate oxidative products damages cells. Hyperglycaemia and glucotoxicity result in oxidative stress in diabetes [114, 115], which is associated with lower antioxidant levels and higher oxidant levels than those in the absence of diabetes [116]. Therefore, a decrease in oxidative stress in the myocardium of diabetic patients would be key supporting evidence of their benefit in diabetic cardiomyopathy.",
        "AMPK/Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signalling may confer myocardial protection in diabetes. Oxidative stress and other pathologies uncouple eNOS, which is accompanied by abnormal electron transfer, and increase the production of ROS but not NO [117, 118], causing tissue damage. There is evidence that canagliflozin can activate eNOS in the myocardium and kidney. In an isoprenaline (ISO)-induced oxidative stress model, the phosphorylation of eNOS was significantly inhibited in the heart and kidney and was reversed by canagliflozin [119, 120]. Rescue was blocked by an AMPK inhibitor, which is consistent with the effect of AMPK/Akt signalling on canagliflozin activity. Another study reported that empagliflozin increased eNOS activity in the myocardium of obese mice fed a high-fat diet [121]. This evidence indicates that SGLT2i decrease oxidative stress, ROS and nitrate in tissues. The physiology of NO produced by NOS is well known. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) differs from neurogenic nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and eNOS and is associated with local inflammation [122, 123]. Compared with eNOS and nNOS, iNOS forms more superoxide and causes nitrative stress, which is effective for killing and inhibiting pathogens but also injures cells [124]. In an ISO-induced oxidative stress model, myocardial expression of iNOS was upregulated more than 3 times, but canagliflozin significantly reduced iNOS levels, which also decreased superoxide and nitrate [119]. Nox4 signalling has also been shown to induce iNOS [125]. Increased Nox4 activity has been associated with increased ROS production [126], and in an ISO-induced model of oxidative stress in mice, canagliflozin decreased Nox4 protein expression in the heart and kidney [119, 120].",
        "The nuclear factor erythroid factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase (HO-1) pathway plays an important role in protecting cells when oxidative stress occurs in animal models. The activation of Nrf2 and HO-1 increased the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) and decreased the expression of malondialdehyde (MDA) compared with that in the control group without Nrf2 and HO-1 activation [127–129]. In a T2DM model, lipid hydroperoxide and MDA levels were significantly increased compared with those in the control group, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and SOD were reduced. Empagliflozin could partially reverse the differences between the diabetes and control groups, indicating that oxidative stress was improved [102]. The mechanism of action involved activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. In other studies, canagliflozin had similar effects. Myocardial oxidative stress caused by ISO manifested as increased levels of MDA, advanced protein oxidation products, and myeloperoxidase and decreased levels of catalase, SOD, and GSH in the myocardium and plasma. The responses to ISO were reversed by canagliflozin treatment with a synchronous increase in Nrf2 [119].",
        "Silencing information regulator 2 related enzyme 1 (SIRT1) regulates genes that attenuate oxidative stress in T2DM [130]. SIRT1 could decrease oxidative stress in diabetic cardiomyopathy [131, 132]. SGLT2i activate SIRT1 and its downstream signals [133, 134], which helps to explain how SGLT2i decrease oxidative stress in diabetic cardiomyopathy. The antioxidant effect induced by the activation of SIRT1 in T1DM diabetic cardiomyopathy mainly includes the SIRT1/Nrf2 signalling pathway [131], while in T2DM, it includes the Sirt1/forkhead box class O1 (FOXO1) signalling pathway [132]. Antioxidant activity mediated by SIRT1/FOXO1 was mediated by increased phosphorylation of SIRT1 and decreased acetylation of FOXO1. Deacetylation of FOXO1 by SIRT1 increases the transcription of cell cycle arrest genes, including those encoding antioxidant enzymes such as SOD2 [135].",
        "Diabetes promotes programmed cells in the myocardium [136, 137], which results in decreased cardiac contractility, heart failure, and other complications. In the classic apoptosis pathway, the activation of caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-7 causes membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, the formation of apoptotic bodies, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. The pyroptosis pathway is mediated by caspases-1, -4, -5, and -11, which can cleave the cytosolic protein gasdermin D, and the latter can form large oligomeric pores in the inner layer of the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles to kill the cell [138].",
        "Research on the inhibitory effect of SGLT2i on caspase-3 in the myocardium has begun. Trang et al. [139] showed that the levels of ERK1/2 and the proapoptotic gene Bax, which was promoted by ERK1/2, were increased, the level of pSTAT3, which can upregulate the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, was decreased, and the level of caspase-3 was increased in STZ-induced diabetic rat hearts. However, empagliflozin treatment changes these indicators to varying degrees [139]. Bax promotes mitochondrial outer membrane permeability, which results in the release of proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm to activate the caspase cascade [140]. Bcl-2 prevents the release of cytochrome c, thereby inhibiting the caspase cascade [141]. It is clear that inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway and promotion of the STAT3 pathway by SGLT2i decrease cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In addition, high serum LPS originating from the gut microbiota contributes to myocardial inflammation and cell death in diabetes patients (see below). Koyani et al. [70] reported that empagliflozin reduced the LPS-induced increase in TNF-α levels associated with increased AMPK phosphorylation. TNF-α is known to activate caspase-3 via the caspase-12 cascade to induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis [142]. In animal models of heart I/R injury and hepatorenal syndrome, early administration of SGLT2i was reported to downregulate cleaved caspase-3 [143, 144], which is consistent with our expectations.",
        "Recent studies reported that SGLT2i inhibited caspase-1 and that the mechanism involved a pathway including AMPK/NLRP3/apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) [145–148]. Activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)/NF-κB and an increase in the transcription of inflammasome-related components, including inactive NLRP3, proIL-1β, and proIL-18. The oligomerization of inactive NLRP3, ASC, and procaspase-1 and the formation of an NLRP3-inflammasome complex [149] catalyse the conversion of procaspase-1 to caspase-1 and cause pyroptosis [150, 151]. The mRNA expression of NLRP3, ASC, IL-1β, and caspase-1 in cardiomyocytes did not increase significantly in wild-type mice but did so in the myocardia of type 2 diabetic (BTBR ob/ob) mice [152]. Dapagliflozin was not associated with the expression of NLRP3, ASC, IL-1β, or caspase-1 in normal wild-type mice but did reverse these factors in BTBR mice. Researchers then investigated the detailed mechanism of these changes. LPS increased the mRNA expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 and decreased the P-AMPK/total-AMPK ratio in cardiac fibroblasts in wild-type and BTBR mice. Preincubation of cardiac fibroblasts with dapagliflozin attenuated the changes in the mRNA expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 and the ratio of P-AMPK/total AMPK induced by LPS in wild-type and BTBR mice [152]. This finding suggests that the effectiveness of dapagliflozin was associated with AMPK, which was also reported in Chen et al. [153] (Fig. 5).",
        "Autophagy digests long-lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles to meet the metabolic needs of the cell and the renewal of certain organelles [154, 155]. Autophagy imbalance and disruption occur in diabetes. Acute induction of autophagy may be beneficial, but persistent autophagy induction may be harmful [156, 157].",
        "The effects of SGLT2i on autophagy have been studied in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Empagliflozin has been reported to increase autophagy in the atrial tissue of ZDF rats. This treatment increased the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) II/I ratio and decreased the protein expression of p62 in the atrial tissues of ZDF rats [25]. Li et al. [158] reported that empagliflozin decreased the protein expression of CD36, which was associated with an increase in p-AMPK, which activated the AMPK/Unc-51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1)/Beclin1 pathway, increased Ulk1 and Beclin1 expression, and promoted autophagy. This process in liver cancer cell experiments does not seem to involve mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). However, dapagliflozin decreased p-mTOR/mTOR in rat colitis model cells, suggesting that the inhibition of mTOR by AMPK [159] is involved in AMPK-mediated enhancement of autophagy [160]. The difference might be related to nutritional status in the two models because AMPK activates Ulk1 to promote autophagy during glucose starvation. In the presence of adequate nutrients, high mTOR activity phosphorylates Ulk1 at Ser 757, which disrupts the interaction between Ulk1 and AMPK to prevent Ulk1 activation [161].",
        "SGLT2i do not enhance autophagy unilaterally. Jiang et al. [162] reported that in T1DM or T2DM and myocardial infarction, cardiomyocyte survival benefitted from the inhibition of enhanced autophagy by empagliflozin, which depended on the downregulation of NHE1 and NHE1-related genes that induce autophagy, such as Beclin 1 and autophagy-related protein 5. In fact, the inhibitory effect of SGLT2i on NHE1 has been widely demonstrated [163], but it is not clear whether Beclin1 is a downstream target of NHE1. Deng et al. [164] found that Beclin1 but not NHE1 was targeted by empagliflozin. Empagliflozin was shown to inhibit the increase in autophagy caused by myocardial infarction with acute hyperglycaemia. Empagliflozin can also reverse the increase in the autophagy-related protein LC3II/I and decrease in P62 in cardiomyocytes induced by Tat-beclin1. This difference may be related to the difference in mouse models; the former model is a T2DM model with myocardial infarction, and the latter model is a nondiabetic myocardial infarction model with acute hyperglycaemia. However, these results show that the regulatory effect of empagliflozin on autophagy involves maintaining a balance, rather than unilaterally enhancing or weakening autophagy.",
        "ER stress involves disturbances in Ca2+ or redox balance and the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins that cannot be processed, which initiates an unfolded protein response (UPR) that leads to apoptosis [165]. The UPR involves three transducers: protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activated transcription factor 6 (ATF-6) and inositol-requiring protein-1α (IRE1α). The transducers bind to the ER chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), and as unfolded proteins accumulate, GRP78 leaves the transducer and is involved in processing the accumulated proteins [166]. This leads to the activation of these three sensors and subsequent lethal effects [167]. Currently, the correlation between diabetes and ER stress has been well established [168].",
        "PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) are signalling pathways involved in ER stress. CHOP is a transcription factor that downregulates BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 expression and upregulates Bim, Bak and Bax expression. CHOP also upregulates the expression of the pseudokinase tribbles homologue 3 gene, which was shown to weaken the inhibition of Caspse-9 and Caspase-3 expression by AKT [169–171].",
        "SGLT2i ameliorate ER stress in animal models induced by heart-pressure overload or I/R injury [172, 173]. In these ER stress models induced by heart pressure overload or I/R injury, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin inhibited the increase in p-PERK and its downstream molecules associated with ER stress due to pressure overload by activating SIRT1 and preventing GRP78 detachment [172, 173]. Cell death was also significantly weakened. Dapagliflozin could significantly reduce GRP78, PERK, eIF-2α, ATF-4, and CHOP expression in the myocardium in an ER stress model induced by doxorubicin [174] (Fig. 6). SGLT2i have been shown to inhibit ER stress through similar downstream pathways in various organs. Ipraglifilozin inhibited the increase in GRP78 and PERK and their downstream signalling molecules associated with ectopic lipid deposition in mouse kidneys [175].Fig. 6The SGLT2 inhibitor improves ER stress. SGLT2 inhibitor treatment inhibits the loss of GRP78 from transducers by activating Sirt1, thus inhibiting the development of ER stress. The downstream signalling pathways of PERK, ATF6 and IRE1α can induce the transcription of CHOP. CHOP upregulates the expression of the pseudokinase tribbles homologue 3 gene and weakens the inhibitory effect of AKT on the expression of caspase-9 and caspase-3. On the other hand, CHOP promotes the expression of Bax and Bak and inhibits the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and MCL-1. IRE1α also promotes apoptosis by sequentially activating ASK1 and JNK",

        "The impact of intestinal flora imbalance on extraintestinal organs has received increasing attention in recent years, and the heart is no exception. The damaged intestinal wall can lead to the entry of intestinal bacteria into the circulation, causing inflammatory responses in multiple organs [176]. After entering the circulation, LPS from gram-negative bacteria is recognized by TLRs on the surface of immune cells and induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines [177]. Continuous infusion of low-dose LPS to mimic metabolic endotoxaemia leads to obesity, insulin resistance, T2DM, and atherosclerosis [178]. The metabolism of cholesterol and lipids by the gut microbiota affects the development of atherosclerotic plaques [179], and bacterial metabolites, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), were shown to lead to myocardial fibrosis, abnormal metabolism, impaired endothelial function, and heart failure following the activation of various signalling pathways [180]. These pathological changes are consistent with the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.",
        "Dapagliflozin has been associated with changes in the gut microbiota, the function of extraintestinal blood vessels, and improvements in cardiovascular dysfunction caused by diabetes. Eight weeks of dapagliflozin treatment significantly increased Akkermansia muciniphila in the gut microbiota and improved generalized vascular dysfunction in mice with T2DM [181]. An increase in the abundance of A. muciniphila and improvements in glucose tolerance and blood glucose levels have been confirmed and correlated with induction of Foxp3-positive regulatory T cells [182]. An increase in A. muciniphila was also shown to reduce endotoxaemia and inflammation and prevent atherosclerosis by inducing the expression of tight junction proteins in the gut [183]. In addition, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been shown to thicken the mucin layer and strengthen the intestinal barrier by stimulating the release of IL-22 from lymphocytes, which prevents endotoxins and LPS from entering the body [184, 185]. Luseogliflozin increased the abundance of Syntrophothermus lipocalidus, family Syntrophomonadaceae, Parabacteroidesdistasonis distasonis, and genus Anaerotignum, which produce SCFAs [186]. Empagliflozin has been associated with an increase in the population of SCFA-producing bacteria and improvements in diabetes and cardiovascular function [187]. Roseburia, Eubacterium, and Faecalibacterium species were increased by empagliflozin treatment, and harmful bacteria, including Escherichia and Shigella, were decreased.",
        "SGLT1 is the predominant receptor in the gut compared with SGLT2 [188]. Studies of the dual SGLT1/2 inhibitor canagliflozin and the SGLT1 inhibitor SGL5213 showed that these agents reversed the expansion of Firmicutes and contraction of Bacteroidetes in the gut microbiota of mice with adenine-induced renal failure [189, 190]. Increases in SCFAs such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate in the caecum and decreases in plasma TMAO levels were also found in a renal failure mouse model after treatment. These findings suggest that inhibition of SGLT1 reduces glucose uptake, while unabsorbed glucose temporarily reaches the lower small intestine [191], resulting in an altered glucose load and a possibly altered gut microbiota composition.",
        "The goal of basic research is to support clinical use. We have reviewed animal and clinical trials that evaluated the therapeutic effect of SGLT2i. The results of some animal trials support the performance of clinical trials. Here, we show some representative clinical evidence in response to the results of theoretical research (Table 2).Table 2Effect of SGLT2i in clinical treatmentDrugsTypeObjectFollow-up periodEffect of outcomeMultiple SGLT2iClinical trial77 first heart transplant recipients (37 patients with diabetes)At least 6 months before surgery and 12 months after surgeryReduce myocardial triglyceride accumulation [1]EmpagliflozinRandomized controlled trial97 participants with T2DM and coronary artery disease (CAD)6 monthsReduce LVM indexed to body surface area [2]DapagliflozinRandomized controlled trial66 patients with T2DM and LVH12 monthsReduce absolute LVM [3]DapagliflozinRandomized controlled trial97 patients with T2DM and atherosclerotic disease12 weeksIncrease FMD [4]DapagliflozinRandomized controlled trial16 patients with T2DM and stable coronary artery disease4 weeksIncrease MFR [5]DapagliflozinClinical trial59 patients with T2DM6 weeksImprove vascular remodelling [6]Multiple SGLT2iObservational study583 diabetic AMI patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)The use of SGLT2i started at least 3 months before hospitalizationReduce infarct size after AMI [7]EmpagliflozinClinical trial1549 patients with T2DM104 weeksReduce blood uric acid concentration [8]DapagliflozinClinical trial3119 patients with heart failure12 monthsReduce blood uric acid concentration [9]CanagliflozinClinical trial2313 patients with T2DM26 weeksReduce blood uric acid concentration [10]DapagliflozinRandomized controlled trial44 patients with T2DM12 weeksDid not change the composition of the gut flora [11]Multiple SGLT2iMeta-analysis38,335 patients with type 2 diabetesMedian follow-up duration was 1.8 yearsReduce the risk of AF and AFL [12]Multiple SGLT2iMeta-analysis1831 patients with acute heart failure with and without T2DMRanged from 60 days to 9 monthsReduce the risk of rehospitalization for heart failure and improve KCCQ score [13]Multiple SGLT2iMeta-analysis10978 patients with T2DM with or without chronic heart failureRanged from 14 days to 1 yearReduce NT-proBNP concentrations and improve cardiac diastolic function and LVEF [14]",
        "Effect of SGLT2i in clinical treatment",
        "First, SGLT2i improves myocardial metabolism in diabetic patients. SGLT2i (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin) reduce the expression of PPAR-γ in the hearts of patients. Similar to the mechanism described above, this effect can reduce the accumulation of fatty acids in myocardial cells [192], which is exactly what happened.",
        "Empagliflozin is encouraging in terms of improving ventricular remodelling in diabetic patients. For example, in a clinical randomized controlled trial, the SGLT2i empagliflozin significantly reduced the left ventricular mass relative to body surface area [193]. Similarly, a randomized controlled trial of dapagliflozin demonstrated a significant reduction in left ventricular mass (LVM) in patients with T2DM and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) [194].",
        "In diabetes patients with atherosclerotic disease, endothelial changes occur in the microvasculature and macrovasculature, and 12 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment resulted in a significant increase in FMD [195]. Another study demonstrated that 4 weeks of dapagliflozin increased myocardial flow reserve (MFR) in patients with stable coronary artery disease and T2DM [196]. In addition, clinical studies have confirmed that dapagliflozin can prevent microcirculation remodelling in diabetes patients and can decrease the stiffness of large blood vessels [197]. T2DM patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who had received long-term treatment with SGLT2i before admission had smaller infarct sizes and lower inflammatory markers than those receiving other oral hypoglycaemic agents [198].",
        "The effectiveness of SGLT2i for improving hyperuricaemia has been clinically verified. Dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin have been shown to promote uric acid excretion in patients with or without diabetes [199–201]. This evidence shows that SGLT2i maintain cardiovascular function and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.",
        "The regulation of intestinal flora by SGLT2i is less clear. In a 12 week double-blind randomized trial, significant changes in gut microbiota diversity or composition were not observed in T2DM patients after dapagliflozin treatment [202]. The results may have been influenced by the administration of other drugs, including previous metformin monotherapy. In addition, the doses of dapagliflozin that are appropriate for treating diabetes may not be appropriate for regulating the gut microbiota. Additional studies of the impact of SGLT2i on the human intestinal microbiota are needed.",
        "Several meta-analyses have provided more extensive and persuasive evidence that SGLT2i improve diabetes-induced cardiac insufficiency. T2DM increases the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL), and dapagliflozin significantly reduces AF and AFL [203]. Treatment of patients with AHF with SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of rehospitalization due to heart failure and improved Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores [204]. SGLT2i improved diabetes-associated cardiac structure and function. A meta-analysis showed that SGLT2i partially reduced plasma NT-proBNP concentrations and improved cardiac diastolic function. However, SGLT2i improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) only in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in stage C heart failure [205]. On the other hand, in patients with HFpEF, especially those with stage A-B heart failure, the effect of SGLT2i treatment is not significant.",
        "SGLT2i are safe, well-tolerated drugs. They can improve all glycaemic parameters and have some additional benefits, such as weight and BP reductions, low risk of hypoglycaemia, improvements in β-cell function and insulin sensitivity, and reductions in macrovascular and microvascular events [206]. However, there are still many challenges to be solved in clinical practice. These challenges include but are not limited to decreased blood pressure, urinary and genital tract infections, amputation, ketoacidosis, kidney injury and fracture. Reduced blood pressure in SGLT2i users is understandable, which is caused by insufficient circulating blood volume due to osmotic diuresis. Meta-analyses showed that SGLT2i induced an average reduction in systolic/diastolic BP of 3.62/1.70 mmHg in 24 h ambulatory blood pressure [207]. However, the use of SGLT2i alone was very unlikely to cause postural hypotension. The use of SGLT2i has been reported to increase the risk of urinary and genital tract infections by more than 3 times [208]. The main reason may be related to the increase in urine sugar concentration. As previously mentioned, canagliflozin caused twice the risk of lower limb amputation compared to the control, possibly due to the inhibition of angiogenesis [209]. An increased incidence of ketoacidosis has been reported in SGLT2i users [210]. The prevailing belief is that this outcome is associated with glucose loss, increased hyperglucagonemia, constant or decreased insulin levels, mild infections, and decreased blood volume. This mechanism may induce euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis. The evidence that SGLT2i may cause acute renal injury is available [211], and the associated factors include circulatory failure, increased uric acid in urine, and multiple drug use [212, 213]. However, this treatment is not recognized as an inducer of acute renal injury, and several clinical trials have confirmed that SGLT2i have positive effects on kidney function [214]. In assessing the increased risk of fracture associated with SGLT2i, canagliflozin was directly associated with bone mineral density loss, especially in the hip. Dapagliflozin was associated with fractures unrelated to osteoporosis, mainly due to an increased risk of falls caused by fluctuations in blood pressure and hypoglycaemia caused by the combined use of hypoglycaemic drugs. However, empagliflozin was considered safe [215]. In addition, there are still some unresolved questions. The limited clinic evidence showed that SGLT2i improves the concentration of circulating proteins in plasma, serum or urine that are known to have beneficial effects on the heart [216]. These proteins include insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1, transferrin receptor protein 1, erythropoietin and so on. But the exact target and signalling pathway of SGLT2i in clinic treatment are still not fully understood. The optimal dose of SGLT2i for diabetic cardiomyopathy and whether this dose is consistent with the dose for diabetic treatment still need experimental verification [217, 218].",
        "In light of the current challenges associated with SGLT2i, we reviewed some of the guidelines and provided some insight into future strategies for the use of SGLT2i [218]. The use of SGLT2i is strongly recommended in patients with HFrEF and with or without T2DM, patients with T2DM and coronary heart disease, patients with T2DM were over 50 years old who had risk factors associated with coronary heart disease, and patients with albuminuric renal disease with or without T2DM. The benefits of SGLT2i on these patients have been well documented and reduce the risk of HF hospitalization. Moreover, we may avoid some possible complications by individualized medications and appropriate periodic examinations. For patients with suspected ketoacidosis symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dyspnoea during SGLT2i use, blood and urine ketone body analysis should be performed in time. Patients who use SGLT2i should be advised to pay attention to perineal hygiene. For patients with urinary tract infection during medication use, SGLT2i administration should be paused, and anti-infective therapy should be given. SGLT2i should be discontinued in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. Patients taking SGLT2i and diuretics together need to monitor their blood pressure. Canagliflozin is contraindicated in patients with lower extremity vascular stenosis or with osteoporosis. For renal insufficiency, patients with glomerular filtration rates less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 should be treated with low-dose SGLT2i or not treated with SGLT2i.",
        "In this review, we mainly focused on basic studies to elucidate the pharmacological mechanism of SGLT2i and related signalling pathways or targets for the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Studies have shown that SGLT2i can improve diabetic cardiomyopathy by improving myocardial metabolism, restoring mitochondrial function, improving microcirculatory disorders, reducing myocardial fibrosis, reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting programmed death, regulating autophagy, inhibiting ER stress and regulating the intestinal flora. In addition, we present representative clinical trials demonstrating the beneficial effects of SGLT2i in clinical use. Finally, we briefly discuss the current challenges and possible future strategies for the utilization of SGLT2i.",
        "Our aim was to arouse more attention from readers through this review to further explore the potential mechanisms and targets of SGLT2i in the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy in the clinic and lay a solid foundation for the reasonable use of SGLT2i; SGLT2i can save more patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy. In addition, these findings could help in the development of new drugs for diabetic cardiomyopathy based on relevant signals or therapeutic targets.",

    "title": "The Metformin Paradox. metformin therapy was not as beneficial as a lifestyle modification for delaying the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk of the disease. A key feature in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which appears in the prediabetic phase, is a significant deficiency, compared to healthy controls, in highly flexible poly-cis-unsaturated fatty acyl chains in membrane phospholipids. This deficiency lowers membrane flexibility, which in turn, reduces the amount of all functional Class I glucose transporters, and thereby reduces glucose-mediated ATP production. This leads to an increase in essentially saturated free fatty acid (FFA) levels for fatty-acid-mediated ATP production, which will set up a vicious cycle of raising the levels of essentially saturated FFAs and lowering the level of transmembrane glucose transport. Metformin suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis, which reduces the plasma glucose concentration. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that chronic metformin treatment leads to an additional increase in essentially saturated FFAs, which causes an additional rise in membrane stiffness and hypoxia. So we propose that all these metformin-mediated activities accelerated the onset of type 2 diabetes in the participants of the metformin group in the Diabetes Prevention Program study, compared to the participants of the lifestyle-intervention group in this study. We propose that the biochemical reactions, involved in the fatty-acid-mediated ATP production, play an important part in the increase of the observed essentially saturated FFA concentrations. These statements should also extend to the metformin therapy of individuals with type 2 diabetes. epub@benthamscience.net. Netherlands.",

        "Core tip: To maximize type 2 diabetes care the assessment of unsaturation index, as observed in erythrocytes, is strongly indicated with intervals of three months. The value of unsaturation index is a reliable parameter for controlling the acyl composition of phospholipids as modulators of membrane flexibility. Given the main role of free fatty acids in this process the assessment of free fatty acids instead of triglycerides assessment may be of benefit for monthly monitoring purposes. Counseling of exercise should be an essential element of the type 2 diabetes management plan.",
        "Nine years after Banting et al[1] extracted insulin from a dog’s pancreas, Falta et al[2] introduced the term “insulin resistance” in the medical literature. Based on clinical and biochemical observations, they differentiated hyperglycemia in two distinct types: A form where a relative modest dose of insulin the metabolic disorder completely compensated, referred to as “Insular Diabetes”, and a form where a vast amount of insulin is well tolerated without causing a hypoglyceamia, referred to as “Insulinresistenter Diabetes”. They defined the concept that insulin resistance may be one of the main causes of type 2 diabetes[2]. Five years later Himsworth[3] confirmed the principle of insulin resistance.",
        "Since then, insulin resistance as a term describing the relative ineffectiveness of insulin was commonly used. However, MacBryde[4] wrote already in 1933: “There is as yet no general agreement as to its definition”, but this remark did not come into general acceptance not even after almost 90 years. MacBryde is still a voice crying in the wilderness. A short, incomplete summary proves that MacBryde’s remark is right up to the present day (Table 1)[5-12]. One of the aims of this study is to demonstrate that the recurrent phrase “insulin resistance” is an imaginary reality, i.e. a reality in which everyone believes, and as long as this collective belief exists this imaginary reality exerts power in the world.",
        "Short summary of different definitions of the term: Insulin resistance",
        "From the late 1990s, the advent of the minimal model for estimating the glucose metabolism in man has opened a new chapter to evaluate MacBryde’s remark. The minimal model approach analyses the relationship between the pattern of insulin response and the rate of glucose decline to infer the sensitivity of tissues to insulin. Additionally, the model measures a relevant, less well recognized, factor called glucose effectiveness. This term describes the ability of glucose, per se, independent of changes in insulin concentration, to stimulate its own up-take by a mass action effect and to suppress its own release. Despite the one-compartment optimized minimal model overestimates the net glucose effectiveness, the results of this model as well as the two-compartment minimal model, which use computer modeling of glucose and insulin kinetics after intravenous glucose challenge, indicated that individuals with type 2 diabetes and individuals in the prediabetic phase had significantly lower values of both glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity compared to healthy controls (Table 2)[13-16]. So what this means is that insulin sensitivity (SI) is positively related to glucose effectiveness (SG). Moreover, a prospective study on the development of type 2 diabetes in normoglycaemic offspring of couples, who both had type 2 diabetes, showed significant defects in both SG and SI, i.e., more than 10 years before the development of the disease, participants who developed the disease had lower values, compared to controls, of SI [(3.2 ± 2.4 vs 8.1 ± 6.7) × 10-3·L·min-1·pmol -1 insulin; P < 0.0001] and SG [(1.6 ± 0.9 vs 2.3 ± 1.2) × 10-2·min-1; P < 0.0001][15].",

        "To circumvent the limitations of the one-compartment minimal model, we used SG and SI values of stable isotope-labelled glucose data obtained from the two-compartment minimal model for estimation the relative contribution of SG to the glucose restoration rate during a basal state. In the basal state, healthy individuals have insulin oscillations with a regular 14-min periodicity of amplitude of 1.8 mU/L[17]. Hence, the relative contribution of SG to the glucose restoration rate during the basal state is given by SG/(SG + SI × 10.8)[18]. The calculated data demonstrate that almost the total fractional glucose turnover of type 2 diabetes during the basal state results from the ability of glucose to stimulates its own uptake, i.e., 89.2% (Table 3). The essence of this outcome is the rather limited impact of insulin on the reduction in glucose effectiveness, which already appears in the prediabetic phase. Of note, the reduction in SI is essentially greater than the reduction in SG in type 2 diabetes and its prediabetic phase, independent of the assay methods (Table 2).",

        "The results mentioned in Table 2 touch a fundamental problem: If the insulin-sensitivity regulation system of an individual in his prediabetic or diabetic phase is unable to respond efficiently to an increase in the glucose level, what affects in this person the non-insulin-sensitive regulation system, i.e., the reduction in the ability of glucose, per se, to stimulate its own up-take by a mass action effect and to suppress its own release? The question is: Is there a single, all-encompassing biochemical system between both the reduction in glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity? Up until now, the answer to this fundamental question cannot be found in any textbook, but is given in this review.",
        "Shulman et al[19] resolved in part the questions raised in the previous section by studying muscle glycogen synthesis in subjects with type 2 diabetes and matched controls by means of in vivo carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy[19-21]. They demonstrated that the muscle glycogen synthesis rate in subjects with type 2 diabetes was about 50% of the rate observed in healthy controls. The same group also investigated, under hyperglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic conditions, the pathway: Transmembrane glucose transport into the muscle cell, conversion of intracellular glucose into glucose-6-phosphate, and via two more intermediates to glycogen synthase, which adds glucose to the glycogen polymer. They concluded that the results are consistent with the hypothesis that transmembrane glucose transport is the rate-controlling step in insulin-stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis in patients with type 2 diabetes and the delivery of insulin is not responsible for the insulin resistance. Based on these results, two options arise for explaining the significantly reduced glycogen synthesis rate in subjects with type 2 diabetes relative to healthy controls: First, type 2 diabetes is characterized by a reduction in the amount of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) per cell surface area, or second, a change in the three-dimensional (3D) structure of GLUT4, which affects the amount of transmembrane glucose-transport. Northern blot and slot blot study results of biopsies of skeletal muscles obtained from individuals with type 2 diabetes and age-matched and body-weight-matched healthy controls indicated that there was no significant alteration in the level of GLUT4 mRNA and GLUT4 protein in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared to healthy controls. GLUT1 mRNA and protein concentrations were also not significantly different in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared to control subjects[22,23]. This excludes the first option. To demonstrate the second option plays a pivotal role in the onset of type 2 diabetes, we must enter the area of cell membranes.",
        "Phospholipid bilayers form rapidly and spontaneously when phospholipids are added to water. Mammalian phospholipids contain a 1,2-diacylglycerol backbone that has a phosphate group esterified at carbon atom 3, and generally a saturated fatty acid (FA) esterified at carbon atom 1, and a saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated FA esterified at carbon atom 2. The two acyl chains yield a roughly cylindrical molecule that can easily pack in parallel arrays to form extended sheets of membranes composed of a mosaic of proteins and phospholipids in a fluid phospholipid matrix[24]. The driving force of this aggregation is the weak, noncovalent bond (van der Waals force) between pairs of carbon atoms, lying next to each other in the carbon 1 and the carbon 2 acyl chains. The most structural result obtained from X-ray scattering analyses of oriented bilayers in artificial phospholipid membrane systems is the area (A) per lipid molecule. This area denotes the cross-section of the cylindrical space occupied by a phospholipid. Various studies of fully hydrated, fluid phase, model phosphatidylcholine bilayers have demonstrated that introducing one or more carbon-carbon cis double bonds into saturated acyl chains will increase the cross-section area A (Table 4)[25-28]. The advantage of this type of artificial bilayer model is its flexibility, the ability to bend or to be bent easily without breaking.",

        "Based on the published data, we are able using the Lennard-Jones equation: U = (11.5 × 10-6)/r12 – (5.96 × 10-3) /r6 to estimate roughly the interaction energy between a pair of carbon atoms, which lie next to each other in the phospholipid acyl chains, esterified at the 1- and 2-positions of glycerol (Table 4)[29]. For instance, a comparison of the cross-section area (A) of an artificial bilayer consisting of dimy-ristoylphosphatidylcholine [(C14:0;C14:0)PC; area (A) = 60.6 (Å)2] with the cross-section area (A) of an artificial bilayer consisting of palmitoyl-docosahexaenoic phosphatidylcholine [(C16:0; C22:6)PC; area (A) = 74.8 (Å)2] reveals that the cross-section area (A) of the latter increases by 23.4%, which results in an increase in the interchain carbon-carbon distance of 11.2%, and thereby reduces with 37.6% the interaction energy per pair of acyl chain carbon atoms. In other words, a reduction in carbon-carbon double bonds in phospholipid acyl chains results in a reduction in membrane flexibility[30]. More generally, the flexibility of polyunsaturated phospholipids along the membrane normal (z direction) might soften various mechanical stresses in the membrane[31]. In other words, the number of double bonds (= unsaturation) in the acyl chains of phospholipids influences the physical properties of cellular membranes.",
        "The degree of membrane flexibility is expressed in unsaturation index (UI) (number of carbon-carbon double bonds per 100 acyl chains) of membrane phospholipids, as observed in erythrocytes. For information about the analytical details of the lipid extraction from erythrocytes, the fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography and the calculation of UI see section Supplementary material. The UI is a variable unit; a value on the right of the reference interval (the range of values that is deemed normal for a physiologic measurement in healthy persons) means an acyl composition of phospholipids with an increased number of carbon-carbon double bonds, whereas a value on the left of the reference interval means an acyl composition of phospholipids with a decreased number of carbon-carbon double bonds. Borkman et al[5] demonstrated in the phospholipid fraction of a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy of healthy man that insulin sensitivity was positively correlated with the percentage of arachidonic acid in muscle (r = 0.76, P < 0.01), the total percentage of C20-C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids (r = 0.76, P < 0.01), and the unsaturation index (r = 0.62, P < 0.05).",
        "The consequence of the aforementioned data is that a reduction in UI is associated with a reduction in insulin sensitivity, which suggests that changes in the acyl composition of tissue phospholipid membranes modulates the action of insulin. Borkman et al[5] suggested that if the action of insulin depends on the acyl composition of muscle membranes, it may be due to interactions within membranes specifically involved in the action of insulin, although a more general effect of membranes cannot be excluded. However, not only a reduction in insulin-mediated glucose disposal is a marker of type 2 diabetes, but also a reduction in non-insulin-mediated glucose disposal (Table 2).",
        "It is interesting to note that the experimental results of Min et al[32,33] demonstrated that a key feature of the prediabetic phase, which appears in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and women with gestational diabetes mellitus, is an essential reduction, compared to healthy controls, in the percentage of phospholipid poly-unsaturated acyl chains, including UI (Table 5, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2)[32,33]. Because phospholipid bilayers with an acyl composition of more carbon-carbon double bonds are more flexible than those with less carbon-carbon double bonds (Table 4), a reduction in membrane flexibility is a key factor regarding the increase in the plasma glucose concentration in type 2 diabetes and its prediabetic phase[34,35].",

UI: Unsaturation index; IGT: Impaired glucose tolerance; GDM: Gestational diabetes mellitus; PC: Phosphatidylcholine; PE: Phosphatidylethanolamine; SFA: Saturated fatty acid; MUFA: Mono-unsaturated fatty acid; PUFA: Poly-unsaturated fatty acid.",
        "Variations in the acyl composition of phospholipid membranes can strongly influence the function of proteins embedded therein[36]. The biochemical and physical background of this mechanism is a reduction in UI, which is equivalent to a reduction in carbon-carbon double bonds of membrane phospholipids and results in a reduction of area A of the lipid molecules (Table 4). A reduction in area A translates into increased attractive forces between the mutual phospholipid acyl chains, which forms a redistribution of the lateral pressure in cell membranes. As a consequence, the redistribution induces a cross-sectional contraction of all Class I GLUT proteins, which in turn, causes a reduction in the amount of transmembrane transported glucose (Figure 1). This important hypothesis is in line with observations presented in biophysical and structural studies, which indicate that interactions of membrane proteins with lipid molecules are critical to their folding and stability[37-39]. This is what evolution is all about: Communicate with the environment and react to changes in the most efficient way[40].",

        "The high glucose environment in women with gestational diabetes mellitus disappears after birth, in conjunction with the raised levels of free fatty acids (FFAs). So, the reduction in membrane flexibility is reversible and the restoration of UI will repair the amount of transmembrane glucose-transport. This is a nice example of how science works in unexpected ways. This generally unknown system of glucose regulation through changes in the acyl composition of phospholipids works fully independent of the insulin level and represents a beautiful unification of insulin sensitivity with glucose effectiveness. I will argue later on that this glucose-regulation system is effective in type 2 diabetes.",
        "Several studies published UI values and supported its utility as a crucial parameter for membrane flexibility, even if still not properly considered by the scientific medical community[41]. It is interesting to note that the elegant study of Borkman et al[5] sums up the idea that the acyl composition of skeletal-muscle phospholipids may influence the action of insulin; unfortunately, this idea turns out not to be true. The author’s idea is that in type 2 diabetes a redistribution of the lateral pressure in cell membranes results in a reduction in the cross-sectional area of all class I GLUTs, and thereby reduces the transmembrane glucose-transport.",
        "Membrane flexibility plays an important role in the scientific understanding of the molecular nature of life. Its role is evident in type 2 diabetes for at least three reasons.",
        "It first affects the insertion of GLUTs into a plasma membrane. GLUT1 is a monomeric protein with 12 transmembrane helical segments[42]. The transporter protein traverses the plasma membrane 12 times in a zigzag fashion before initiating the folding, which is essential for creating its final 3D structure. A central channel across the protein communicates the extracellular and intracellular environments. Several amino acid residues of GLUT1, crucial for transport of β-D-glucose, bound a channel segment of approximately 15 Å long and 7 Å wide. In the proposed structure of GLUT3 the 12 transmembrane helices form a right-hand barrel with a central pore, which is shaped like a funnel with dimensions of approximately 5-6 Å by 8 Å at its narrowest point[43]. To get an idea of the dimensions: The dimensions of an orthorhombic bisphenoidal α-glucose crystal are: a = 10.36 Å, b = 14.84 Å, and c = 4.97 Å[44]. One GLUT1 molecule with a mean cross-section area of about 1100 Å2 covers an area of about 17 phospholipid molecules of a phosphatidylcholine bilayer with saturated acyl chains[27]. So the folding mechanism of a GLUT1 molecule requires flexibility of the cell membrane for achieving a correct 3D structure. In contrast, GLUT4 is inserted into membranes of intracellular vesicles, which demands flexibility of the vesicular membrane. After the insulin-stimulated translocation of the intracellular GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, the GLUT4 containing vesicles take part in a fusion process with the plasma membrane. In the final stage of this process, fusion proteins induce bending of the plasma membrane bilayer to drive fusion pore formation. This includes that in type 2 diabetes the transmembrane glucose transport through non-insulin sensitive glucose transporters is being hampered solely by a reduction in the plasma cell membrane flexibility, whereas the transmembrane glucose transport through the insulin sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 is being hampered by a reduction in the flexibility of two membranes, i.e. the vesicular membrane and the plasma membrane[45,46]. For this reason, the reduction in SI is essentially greater than the reduction in SG at type 2 diabetes (Table 2).",
        "Next, membrane flexibility is associated with atherosclerosis, a condition where arteries become narrowed and showed an increase in vascular stiffness[47]. The erythrocyte membrane is compositionally very similar to the vascular endothelium, a thin layer of cells that keeps arteries smooth and allows blood to flow easily[48]. In support of this, the UI of red cell membrane phospholipids of healthy controls was found to be 155.4[49], and the reported UI of cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical cord veins was found to be 148.2 ± 6.3[50]. So we may suggest that the UI is a highly sensitive sensor for cellular membrane functionality, i.e. if the erythrocyte membrane is affected in type 2 diabetes, then the endothelium may also be affected[51,52]. An amazing example of endothelial dysfunction is presented in a Watch WebMD Video, entitled “How atherosclerosis plaque forms”[53]. This video underlines that although the exact causes of atherosclerosis are not yet clear, many scientists think that plaque formation begins with damage of the endothelium. The author’s idea is that individuals with a low UI (increased membrane stiffness) are more prone to develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, compared to healthy controls.",
        "Finally, membrane stiffness induces tissue hypoxia[54]. The minimum lumen of capillary vessels is about 4-9 μm, and the size of erythrocytes is approximately 8 μm. In the case of type 2 diabetes, the reduction in flexibility of both the erythrocyte membrane and the endothelium has a profound impact on the microcirculation[55]. The resulting decrease in blood flow leads to a reduction in oxygen supply of the surrounding tissues. Because the electrons of the respiratory chain are finally donated to molecular oxygen to form H2O, a status of hypoxia results in an accumulation of electrons in the respiratory complexes, which finally results in the production of the negatively charged superoxide radical O2\n• ─ (the dot means a single unpaired electron), and thereby reduces, among other things, ATP synthesis[56]. Life can only exist by the grace of ATP synthesis. The aforementioned reduced ATP synthesis could be the principle reason that type 2 diabetes is linked to lower life expectancy[57]. The paragraph entitled “Energy transport” later on goes into more detail about the influence of type 2 diabetes on the production of ATP.",
        "The adaptation of an integrated bilayer system to an environmental factor such as temperature is referred to as homeoviscous adaptation. Studies with regard to this theme consistently reported that cold acclimation generates an increase in polyunsaturation of cell membranes of aquatic organisms[58,59]. To keep a flexible and effective membrane at low temperatures, aquatic organisms actualize an increased concentration of unsaturated acyl chains in phospholipids relative to those at warmer temperatures (Table 6, Supplementary Table 3)[60]. It is important to note that the homeoviscous adaptation is a reversible process and exists as early as the beginning of the Ordovicium, about 500 to 400 million years ago.",

        "Hanssen et al[61] reported that 10 d of cold acclimation (14-15 ˚C) markedly increased peripheral insulin sensitivity by about 43% in eight type 2 diabetes subjects. Cold acclimation resulted in an enrichment of GLUT4 at sarcolemma, which facilitated the uptake of glucose. The GLUT4 translocation could not be explained by AMPK activation or improved insulin signaling. Presumably, the authors were unaware that cold acclimation generates an increase in polyunsaturation of cell membranes, which increases membrane flexibility and reduces the cross-sectional contraction of the area A of all Class I GLUT proteins.",
        "A telling example of homeoviscous adaptation is a form of evolutionary heat acclimation, which lies hidden in the relationship between the mammal body mass (M, g) and the basal metabolic rate (BMR; mL of O2 per hour) expressed in the allometric equation of the form: BMR = 4.12 × M0.69[62]. This relationship, with an allometric coefficient of 0.69, means that the BMR grows at a slower rate than the body mass, referred to as the slow-down principle[63]. To understand the consequences of the slow-down principle, imagine a multi-celled development of a single-celled, cube-shaped eukaryote, which grows through cell division with a same speed in all three directions of a Cartesian coordinate system. This type of growth creates a generation sequence of cube-shaped eukaryotic cells with a one cell extension in each three dimensions, per new generation (Table 7). Moreover, each unit cell burns continuously food in oxygen and the molecular remains of the food are finally converted into ATP and heat. To maintain an adequate cell temperature, each of the one-unit cells exchanges one metabolic heat unit per time unit with the environment. The first eukaryotic cell thus exchanges with the environment one heat unit per time unit through 6 identical surface planes. The next generation with 8 (23) unit cells and a total of 24 (6 × 22) unit surface planes exchanges 8 (23) heat units per time unit. The subsequent generation with 27 (33) unit cells and a total of 54 (6 × 32) unit surface planes exchanges 27 (33) heat units per time unit, and so on (Table 7).",
        "Thought experiment of multi-celled development of a single-celled, cube-shaped eukaryotic cell, which grows through cell division in a Cartesian coordinate system with the same speed in all three directions, and exchanges with its environment per unit-cell one heat unit per time unit[63]",
        "The important outcome of this model with the growing cube-shaped eukaryotic cells is that the number of heat units to be exchanged per time unit increases by its cube, and the number of unit surface planes increases by its square (Table 7)[63]. This means that the relative rate of heat production must fall as the number of cells gets larger. How did the evolutionary trajectory of live resolve this problem? Well, over evolutionary time, the slower rate of heat production was achieved by a reduction in UI of membrane phospholipids. Hulbert et al[64] reported that the UI of phospholipids from mammalian species significantly decreased as species body size increased whilst the percentage of total unsaturated acyl chains was relatively constant in mammalian species of very different body mass. So the membrane bilayers of small mammals were generally high in docosahexaenoyl (C22:6 n-3) chains and low in oleyl (C18:1 n-9) chains, and the opposite was observed in large mammals[64]. A telling example of body core temperature regulation during the evolution period from mouse to Homo sapiens is the reduction in skeletal muscle percentage of docosahexaenoyl (C22:6 n-3) chains from approximately 30% to 2% in parallel with a body mass increase from approximately 10 g to 85.000 g[64]. Apart from the brain, the phospholipids of heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver tissues showed a significant negative relationship between the body mass of the species and the docosahexaenoate (C22:6 n-3) content of tissue phospholipids. The brain phospholipids from mammals have a high and relatively constant docosahexaenoate content, irrespectively of the body size of the species[65]. Also the mass-specific metabolic rate of birds depends on the relative balance between mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated acyl chains. These data suggest that the biochemical translation of the slow-down principle is a replacement of polyunsaturated acyl chains by monounsaturated acyl chains in membrane phospholipids, which means that the number of unsaturated acyl chains remains the same, whereas their number of carbon-carbon double bonds decreases, with a consequent reduction of the area A of lipid molecules with all the consequences that entails (see previous section). Instead of insulin action, heat production may cause a reduction in the amount of transmembrane glucose-transport.",
        "Today, a human parallel of this evolutionary principle still occurs during a pregnancy, i.e. an increase in maternal mass may generate a reduction in UI of the acyl composition of maternal phospholipids, which in turn, lowers the maternal membrane flexibility, and thereby reduces the maternal transmembrane glucose-transport. In this way, the maternal plasma glucose concentration and insulin level increase during pregnancy without any impaired sensitivity of tissue to the action of insulin[66].",
        "Type 2 diabetes and its prediabetic phase are characterized, among other things, by an increase in the plasma FFA concentration[67,68]. The cause of this phenomenon is a reduction in the transmembrane glucose-transport of all Class 1 GLUTs, which leads to a reduction in the glucose-mediated ATP production. An absolute requirement for ATP production necessitates cells to make a switch from glucose-mediated ATP production to FFA-mediated ATP production – remember that a single cell consumes around 10 million molecules of ATP every second, which means that in the human body the total turnover of ATP is around 60-100 kg/d[56]. So a reduction in glucose-mediated ATP production promotes an increase in the level of essentially saturated FFAs for extra FFA-mediated ATP production, which will set up a vicious cycle of raising the levels of essentially saturated plasma FFAs and lowering the level of transmembrane glucose transport. After all, the released FFA-pool of human white cells showed approximately 110- and 9-fold decreased percentages of docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) and arachidonic acid (C20:4), respectively, compared with the human serum pool. So, the UI of released FFAs from human white fat cells is substantially lower compared with the UI of serum FFAs in healthy controls (85.5 and 191.9, respectively; Supplementary Table 4)[69-71]. Thus, an increased release of FFAs from adipose tissue into the circulation elevates the plasma concentration of saturated fatty acids. This sequence of events forced a shift from unsaturated to saturated acyl chains in phospholipids of both the erythrocyte membrane and the vascular endothelium[68]. I am telling this matter, because I believe the existence of this vicious cycle decreases progressively the UI of plasma FFAs, which may be a root cause of the progressive character of type 2 diabetes.",
        "To understand the relationship between heat production and the onset of type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes, it is time to address briefly the concept of eukaryotic cellular energy transport. Hydrogen is the energy carrier par excellence for the energy saved in our food. After absorption of food, hydrogen is being stripped from the molecular remains of the nutrients, and passed via the citric cycle into the mitochondrial electron-transport chain. Mitochondria are surrounded by a simple outer membrane and a more complex inner membrane. The space between these two membranes is referred to as the intermembrane space and the space surrounded by the inner membrane as the matrix. The four separate protein complexes of the electron-transport chain are located in the inner membrane. The first two complexes separates the electrons from the hydrogen energy-carriers, after which the electrons are finally donated to molecular oxygen, the ultimate electron acceptor in complex IV of the electron-transport chain, to form H2O. In concert with these processes, respiration pushes the remaining protons (H+-ions) across the mitochondrial inner membrane into the intermembrane space, against a concentration gradient. These protons could re-enter the matrix through the inner mitochondrial membrane in two different ways, first via the channel of the ATP synthase protein complex for driving ATP synthesis, and second via the uncoupling protein1 (UCP1) without using energy for any purpose. In the last way, the proton potential energy is released as heat[72]. It is therefore concluded that UCP1 may play a crucial role in thermogenesis.",
        "Experimental data of intracellular temperature mapping, based on a novel fluorescent polymeric thermometer and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, demonstrated clearly the existence of mitochondrial-mediated heat production[73]. This heat production was observed as a proximal local temperature increase. It could be concluded that the local temperature near the mitochondria was higher than the temperature of the rest of the space in the cytosol (aside from the centrosome). Furthermore, this local heat release from mitochondria is accelerated when ATP synthesis is stalled by an uncoupling reagent[74]. Despite incomplete understanding of the uncoupling functions for maintaining energy homeostasis, all these data suggest that, in healthy subjects, a balance exists between the amount of protons, which re-enter the matrix through ATP synthase on the one hand, and the amount of protons, which re-enter the matrix through UCP1 on the other.",
        "The reviewed data strongly support an alternative model with proposed steps in the development of type 2 diabetes, a disease arising as a result of a hypothetical hereditary anomaly (Figure 2)[63]. The author’s hypothesis proposes that the final result of this anomaly, which already appears in the prediabetic phase, is a status of an increased flux, compared to healthy controls, of intermembrane-space protons, which re-enter the matrix via UCP1, and thereby causes hyperthermia in and around the mitochondria[63]. To keep the mitochondrial temperature within the narrow range compatible with live, the slow-down principle enters into force, which results in an appreciable reduction in UI. This process leads to a marked reduction in membrane flexibility, and thereby reduces the transmembrane glucose-transport, which generates a reduction in glucose-mediated heat production. However, the concomitant disadvantage of this sequence of events is also a reduction in glucose-mediated ATP production. To compensate for the extra loss of glucose-mediated ATP, lipolysis increases to raise the levels of circulating, essentially saturated FFAs, which are needed to generate extra ATP energy for sustaining life. The progressive reduction in UI will set up a vicious cycle of raising the levels of essentially saturated plasma FFAs and lowering the level of transmembrane glucose transport. These phenomena represent a blueprint of the presence of type 2 diabetes and its progressive character in human individuals.",
        "Although the results of genome-wide screen for type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes are still under debate, a refined working hypothesis proposes that the primary effect of the involved genes generates an increased flux of mitochondrial intermembrane-space protons through UCP1 into the matrix, which causes an increase of extra heat. This process initiates the slow-down principle. UCP: Uncoupling protein; FFA: Free fatty acid; GLUT: Glucose transporter.",
        "Remember that Kelley et al[75] reported the presence of impaired functional capacity and morphological alterations of mitochondria, which were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of volunteers with type 2 diabetes. A status of long-term heat acclimation may be the cause of the reported reduced activity of NADH oxidation by the respiratory chain, the smaller mean size of mitochondria with a less clearly defined internal membrane structure, and smaller cristae.",
        "We can now explain why the classical research results of laboratory animals mimicking the human type 2 diabetes has not given any indication regarding the onset of human type 2 diabetes[76,77]. All in all, the characteristics of the animal model should mirror the pathophysiology and natural history of type 2. By contrast, no experimental results are given so far based on animal models with type 2 diabetes, caused by a status of long-term heat acclimation.",
        "The proposed steps in the development of type 2 diabetes model improves our knowledge of the metformin-medication effects[63]. The most widely accepted model of the metformin antihyperglycemic action is its suppression of gluconeogenesis with the amino acid alanine as glucogenic substrate, which principally occurs as a consequence of mitochondrial inhibition[78]. In this context it is interesting to note that the type 2 diabetes specific reduction in the transmembrane glucose-transport promotes a significantly increased hepatic efficiency, compared to healthy controls, in converting alanine to glucose[79,80]. The suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis creates a disturbed participation of glucose in the supply of ATP energy to the body and includes, among other things, stimulation of lipolysis. This process increases the amount of circulating, essentially saturated FFAs, referred to as metformin-mediated FFA increase. Besides the increase of essentially saturated FFAs due to the FFA-mediated ATP production (see section: Free fatty acids), the metformin-mediated FFA-increase could also have a deleterious effect on the membrane flexibility, which accelerates the onset of vascular and neurological complications over the long term[81]. The results of two studies are in line with this idea. First, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study results indicated that metformin therapy was not as beneficial as life style modification for delaying the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes, i.e. the DPP study results demonstrated that lifestyle intervention was twice as good as metformin therapy for delaying the development of type 2 diabetes, and at least as effective in older participants as it was in younger participants[82]. Second, the saturated acyl chain percentages in erythrocyte membrane phospholipids of control individuals, people with type 2 diabetes without retinopathy, and people with type 2 diabetes with retinopathy increased within a life-time from 42.0% via 44.2% to 46.9%, respectively, (Table 8, Supplementary Tables 5 and 6)[83]. However, the percentage of the saturated acyl content of membrane phospholipids was almost constant in mammalian species, independent of their body mass, during the last 600 million years of evolution, which means that a constant percentage of membrane saturated acyl chains is important for biological and biochemical processes[62]. Basically, metformin reduces the plasma glucose concentration, but tends towards an increase in the FFA concentration. This side-effect of metformin is not limited to metformin, but also applies to another class of drugs, which are used for lowering the plasma glucose concentration via inhibiting the glucose reabsorption by inhibiting the sodium-glucose co-transporter[84].",
        "Erythrocyte acyl chain composition in phospholipids and unsaturation index of control individuals, people with type 2 diabetes without retinopathy, and people with type 2 diabetes with retinopathy1",
        "1Ex-post calculations performed by the author (see appendix) are based on the original data listed by Koehrer et al[83]. The calculations of the biochemical characteristics are shown in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6. SFA: Saturated fatty acid; MUFA: Mono-unsaturated fatty acid; PUFA: Poly-unsaturated fatty acid; UI: Unsaturation index.",
        "It is worth to note that the patients included in the “diabetic retinopathy” study were treated according to the recommendations of the French High Authority of Health, who published its last recommendations with metformin as the optimal first-line drug, for the optimal management of diabetes, on January 2013 (personal communication, Niyazi Acar)[85].",
        "Although the role of irisin in the conversion of white adipose tissue into brown adipose tissue is still under debate[86], acute exercise training showed direct effects on “browning” of white fat[87]. Hamilton et al[88] demonstrated in excised murine adipose tissue samples lower levels of unsaturated triglycerides in brown adipose tissue compared with white adipose tissue, an observation consistent with previous results[89]. If the gene expression in the corresponding mouse model does not significantly differ from the human conditions[90], burning of human brown adipose tissue, due to physical activities, induces in phospholipids a shift from saturation into unsaturation, which promotes membrane flexibility. Also, muscular exercise increases the blood flow[91], which promotes oxygenation of cells, stimulates the electron flow down of the respiratory chain, and improves the proton (H+) flux through the ATP synthase driving ATP synthesis, which in turn, reduces the need for FFA-mediated ATP production, and thereby increases membrane flexibility. This may be the main cause, why the US DPP study results indicated that the incidence of type 2 diabetes was 58% lower in the lifestyle-intervention group than in the placebo group[82]. Cellular flexibility is a critical factor for modulating blood flow in microcapillaries (see section: Membrane flexibility). So, an increase in both erythrocyte-membrane flexibility and microvascular endothelium flexibility is of unprecedented clinical relevance: It generates a beneficial reduction in microvascular and macrovascular complications,",
        "Structured lifestyle intervention trials (including physical activity, dietary energy restriction and weight loss) demonstrated reductions of 28%-59% in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance[82,92,93]. However, it is important to note that all the exercise sessions in these randomized controlled trials were supervised, a situation that is not often met in daily practice.",
        "This review highlights a deeper scientific understanding of the molecular nature about important factors underlying the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and its prediabetic phase. Work described in this review is designed to communicate some newly discovered fundamental biomolecular processes governing this disease to a broad audience including everyone who is involved in the complex field of this disease, which is one of the today’s greatest unsolved medical mysteries.",
        "The discovery of the existence of yet another blood glucose regulation mechanism is a milestone in the literature about type 2 diabetes. This overlooked transmembrane glucose transport mechanism, still not mentioned in the medical literature, is based on a redistribution of the lateral pressure in cell membranes, due to a reduction in membrane flexibility, which influences the 3D structure of all Class I GLUT proteins. Variations in the number of carbon-carbon double bounds of phospholipid acyl chains of fluid lipid bilayers modulates the GLUT protein pore diameter of the transmembrane glucose transport channel. In short, impaired glucose tolerance, gestational diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes are characterized by an elevated concentration of essentially saturated FFAs, which creates less flexible membranes, narrows the glucose channels of all Class I GLUT proteins, and thereby lowers the amount of transmembrane glucose transport. Martin et al[15] reported that 10 years before the development of type 2 diabetes glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity in normoglycaemic offspring of couples, who both had type 2 diabetes, were 30% and 60%, respectively, lower compared to controls. This fact indicates that a redistribution of the lateral pressure in cell membranes, due to a reduction in membrane flexibility, influences the 3D structure of all Class I GLUT proteins early in live, which is an unprecedented discovery.",
        "A second milestone is the observation that a reduction in UI, compared to a healthy status, is a characteristic of both the prediabetic phase and diabetic phase of type 2 diabetes. In a previous study I offered the clue that a raised leakage of H+-ions via UCP1 induces in and around mitochondria hyperthermia, which will lead to both a reduction in mitochondrial activity and content[94]. The proposed hyperthermia is countered by the slow-down principle already in the prediabetic phase and initiates a status of long-term heat acclimation, which generates a reduction in both insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness, and an increase in the percentage of the saturated acyl content of phospholipids. Both milestones degrades “insulin resistance” into an imaginary reality and requires a U-turn in thinking on some important issues of type 2 diabetes.",
        "The genetic cause of hyperthermia remains incurable until today; however, there is a way forward. Metformin is useful to obtain a rapid reduction in (too) high glucose concentrations. Doctors who prescribe metformin should give clear information to patients about the metformin-mediated FFA increase and therefore point out the necessity of exercise and diet, which will minimize this metformin side effect. They should control the effect of exercise prescription on patients’ wellbeing by the assessment of plasma FFA concentration for monitoring purposes and the assessment of UI for controlling the level of the total percentage saturated acyl chains of membrane phospholipids, as observed in erythrocytes. To prevent or delay the progressive character of type 2 diabetes, exercise is the medication to be preferred, because it improves blood circulation, micro-oxygenation of cells, and thereby reduces membrane stiffness. However, given the high degree of difficulty of structured lifestyle intervention, exercise sessions need counseling, just like with dietary energy restriction[95].",
        "Remember that the complete oxidation of palmitic acid or stearic acid to CO2 and H2O per hydrogen atom more molecules of ATP produces, compared to a complete oxidation of glucose[96], which logically demands less FFA molecules, compared to glucose molecules, for a similar amount of ATP production. However, against the background of the observation that the saturated acyl chain percentages in erythrocyte membrane phospholipids of control individuals, people with type 2 diabetes without retinopathy, and people with type 2 diabetes with retinopathy increased within a life-time, the conclusion is that circulating saturated FFAs play a main role in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.",
        "A detailed working hypothesis proposes that a key feature in the etiology of type 2 diabetes, which appears in the prediabetic phase, is an essentially raise, compared to healthy controls, in the flux of intermembrane-space protons, which re-enter the matrix via UCP1, and thereby causes hyperthermia in and around the mitochondria. The reviewed data highlight the need for studies to find the cause of the essential raise in this proton flux through UCP1, because it will improve the possibilities for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, treatment, and care.",

        "Presently, there are more than 415 million people affected by diabetes mellitus worldwide, according to the International Diabetes Federation, and this figure is projected to rise to over 642 million or more by 2040. Around 90% of diabetic patients in the worldwide are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The cost of health care related to diabetes and its secondary complications continues to expand and is a massive economic burden for afflicted diabetic patients and particularly developing countries (Diabetes Atlas, 7th edition, International Diabetes Federation, 2015). T2DM represents a major global health issue and incidence of diseases increases with various genetic and other associated factors such as age, obesity, stress, diet, ethnicity, lack of exercise and inflammation. The burden of type 2 diabetes and its major complications are rising worldwide [1].",
        "Inflammation has been recognized as a key player in the pathophysiology of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and its secondary complications [2]. Chronic low-grade inflammation and an activation of the various immune reactions are particularly involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-linked insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Activated inflammatory markers are major factors to initiate and develop diabetes-associated complications including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease, etc. [3,4]. Therefore, targeting the inflammation and its signaling pathways may be an active target to prevent/manage diabetes mellitus and its associated complications. Existing therapeutic drugs used for diabetes, which increase various secondary complications including cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, liver injury, dizziness, mental disorders, weight gain, and skin diseases [5].",
        "Natural products and its derived active compounds may be achievable alternatives for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and its complications without any adverse effects. There are a huge number of active medicinal plants and its natural bioactive molecules that have already reported the therapeutic nature against diabetes [6]. Several medicinal plants have been used since ancient times to manage and prevent diabetes and associated conditions [7].",
        "Looking into the list of drugs approved within the last decades demonstrates that plant ingredients are still of importance in drug discovery. Plant compounds have been shown to confer some protection against the pathology of diabetes mellitus through the attenuation of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, this paper intends to review the most salient recent reports on the anti-inflammatory associated diabetes mellitus properties of phytochemicals and the molecular mechanisms underlying these properties.",
        "Insulin resistance or T2DM has been well-defined as a state of universal inflammation condition involving both innate and adaptive immunity [3]. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that various anti-inflammatory agents can improve blood glucose level and pancreatic beta cell function in T2DM [8,9]. Thus, inflammatory associated pathways are one of the principal pathways in the pathogenesis of T2DM and its complications.",
        "T2DM are associated with increased expressions of complete markers of chronic inflammation and the primary molecular link between inflammation and T2DM are macrophage mediators, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Elevated amounts of these pro-inflammatory cytokines have been confirmed in diabetes mellitus [10]. The trend of diabetic patients to have higher amounts of inflammation status has serious consequences that contribute to both microvascular and macrovascular complications [11]. Among both types of complications, macrovascular complications are critical for human life, namely, cardiovascular disease and also around 80% of diabetic patients die from coronary artery diseases and its related complications [12].",
        "Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a key chemokine produced by mainly adipocytes upon recruitment of macrophages and endothelial cells [13]. The augmented release of circulating MCP-1 during adiposity, promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines thereby, it impairs the inflammation associated with type 2 diabetes. Adiponectin is one of the most important anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by white adipose tissue. The level of adiponectin mainly reduces in obesity, and inflammation associated type 2 diabetic conditions; meanwhile, the increased level of adiponectin was observed during type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) [14].",
        "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are playing a central role in innate immunity by their capability to sense pathogens across the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and to notice tissue injury through the danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [15]. Among different types of TLRS, TLRs 1,2,4,5,6, and 11 are plasma membrane proteins, while TLRs 3,7,8 and 9 exist in intracellular compartments. Various factors including microbial constituents provoke the activation of the TLR (excluding for TLR3) signaling through a MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor)-dependent pathway, principal to the activation of the signaling transcription factor NF-κB and the production of inflammatory mediators. These TLR signaling pathways might activate through the production of numerous factors including endogenous HMGB1 (High-Mobility Group Box 1), and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) [15,16].",
        "HMGB1 is also one of the ligands for activation for TLR2 and 4, and it has also been elevated in an experimental diabetic animal model. It was previously recognized as one of the transcription factor regulator, and it was later confirmed as a cytokine produced through cell damage and immune cells like macrophages, thus HMGB1 actively stimulates a NF-κB signaling cascade [17,18].",
        "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which were principally believed as oxidative derivatives, due to from diabetic hyperglycemia conditions, and these are gradually realized as a possible risk factor for pancreatic islet β-cell injury and type 2 diabetes. These AGEs significantly elevated the inflammatory markers as well as oxidative markers in diabetic conditions; meanwhile, it impairs the production and action of insulin [19].",
        "Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have clearly established that adipose tissue, livers, muscles and pancreases are major sites of inflammation of the occurrence of obesity and T2DM [2]. An infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue, liver, muscle and pancreas are seen in obesity and diabetes-induced animal models and in obese human individuals with T2DM. Macrophages are essential for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [20], including TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β and other inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators act in an autocrine and paracrine way to stimulate insulin resistance by interfering with insulin signaling in peripheral tissues through activation of various inflammatory associated pathways such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways [21,22]. These pathways are responsible for promoting the tissue inflammation in obesity and diabetic condition.",
        "At the molecular level, signaling pathway, NF-κB is the inflammation principal switch that controls the synthesis of numerous active proteins series such as IκB, IL-1β, IL-1, and TNF-α for the activation and maintenance of the inflamed state. In obesity condition, it stimulates the NF-κB activation and associated pathways in adipose tissue, livers, and pancreases, thus promoting insulin resistance and T2DM. Researchers have proven that inflammation is not only a marker, but it is also a mediator of disease that was confirmed earlier.",
        "The immune cells’ macrophages can be categorized into two distinct subtypes: the “classically activated macrophages” phenotype, termed M1, which produce major pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and the “alternatively activated macrophages” phenotype, termed M2, which produces major anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 [20]. Furthermore, macrophage infiltration in to adipose tissue and obesity causes a phenotypic switch from the M2 to M1 phenotype, connecting with insulin resistance in animals and humans [23]. The M1 phenotype of macrophages can alter insulin signaling pathways and adipogenesis in adipocytes while M2 macrophages appear to safeguard against obesity-induced insulin resistance [20].",
        "Increased expression/production of TNFα in adipose tissue was observed in obese individuals, and it is playing the vital role in obesity-induced insulin resistance [24]. Previous findings have been confirmed a specific up-regulation of inflammatory genes and an over-production of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in inflamed adipose tissue [2]. Furthermore, improvement in insulin sensitivity induced by weight loss was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory genes [2,25]; hence, inflammation in adipose tissue was considered as a crucial consequence leading to T2DM and its complications.",
        "In the conclusion, previous investigations reveal a complex interaction between cells of innate and adaptive immunity system and the equilibrium among these immune cells turns out to be essential for the homeostasis and control of tissue inflammation in obesity and T2DM (Figure 1).",
        "Several therapeutic interventions are very effective in reducing acute and chronic inflammation and improving diabetes and its complications via indirect or pleiotropic mechanisms. Issues that reduce the inflammation (particularly, key inflammatory markers such as pro-inflammatory mediators TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β and CRP) could offer a vital public health tool to reduce the burden of diabetes and associated complications including cardiovascular diseases in the general population. The probability of regulating innate immunity-related inflammation as an important experimental approach for the management/prevention of T2DM is based on findings that investigated the therapeutic efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents [26].",
        "Nowadays, the key therapeutic agents to treat T2DM and its complications, sulfonylureas, metformin, and insulin-sensitizing glitazones all improve metabolic control and lead to control of various circulating inflammation mediators through innate immunity-related signaling pathways. Sulfonylureas and metformin are main drugs to prevent the T2DM, and sulfonylureas increase insulin production from pancreatic β-cells, while metformin suppresses glucose production in the liver and meanwhile increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues [27]. Glitazones, another anti-diabetic drug, binds to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), beginning a transcriptional activity that leads to improved insulin action through reducing the secretion of inflammatory markers. Consequently, glitazones reduced levels of CRP, PAI-1, TNF-α and other inflammatory markers. These drugs showed better anti-diabetic nature and also have the comparable anti-inflammatory potential [26,28].",
        "Other therapeutic approaches for T2DM that would act as principals in the inflammatory system have been proposed in the form of salicylates, an anti-inflammatory therapeutic that inhibits IκB kinase (IKK), and also lowering the glucose level through improvement of beta cell function [29]. Various well established non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase inhibitors (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) are able to improve glucose-mediated insulin release, glucose tolerance, and reduce the insulin resistance in diabetic patients [30,31].",
        "In clinical studies, treatment with NSAIDs enhanced many biochemical indices such as blood glucose level, glucose uptake, insulin clearance, CRP, lipid profile associated with obesity, and T2DM [32]. Though these findings support the notion that inflammation plays a key role in T2DM and its complications, attenuating inflammation as a strategy for disease prevention in a public health setting will demand a markedly different perspective. In this case, an approach that can be introduced into the population with the minimal side effects and the maximal therapeutic result should be adopted. In this connection, natural products based therapeutic approach would be a better opportunity to treat inflammatory associated chronic diseases like T2DM and its complications, since natural products derived agents are generally safer, lower cost and more highly available in the world.",
        "Natural phyto bioactive compounds are currently more in demand than the synthetic medicines for the treatment of diabetes owing to the rich availability, efficacy and fewer side effects [33,34]. The higher amount of these phyto bioactive compounds rich foods can be consumed on the daily basis that can enhance the antidiabetic activities. It also performed well in various traditional medicines includes Indian Ayurvedic and Chinese traditional medicines and showed enhanced bioactivity of those phyto compounds [35,36]. These phyto bioactive compounds rich extracts either as a single or combination of the multiple extracts showed enhanced anti-diabetic activities. These combination extract therapy aids in multiple actions of those bioactive compounds by single therapies thereby enhance the beneficiary activities, which, in turn, reduces the drug load to the patients. Among the drugs approved for the anti-diabetic activities in the last 10 years, 49% derived from the plant origin. Overall, 1200 phyto bioactive compound rich plants were reported for their better antidiabetic activities, among them 400 phyto bioactive rich plant extracts showed type 2 anti-diabetic activities [34,35,36]. Phyto bioactive compounds include saponin, myrcelin, flavonoids, pectin, and glucosides rich in various parts of the plants showed enhanced antidiabetic activities. The antidiabetic activities of these phytocompounds can be varied based on mechanisms of their actions for lowering the glucose including glucose absorption, target insulin resistance and pancreatic functions.",
        "Phyto bioactive compounds rich in extracts of safflower and Japanese kelp showed higher suppress-glucosidase activity, thereby regulating the glucose absorption in the gut [37,38]. In another study, Inulin, the soluble fiber showed regulation of GLp-1 homeostasis [39]. Further regulation of insulin resistance was reported by various phyto bioactive compounds rich plants such as Dioscorea polysaccharides, blueberry anthocyanins, cinnamon and fenugreek seeds [40,41,42,43]. In addition, several phyto extracts showed combinational effect of these bioactivities and its include chili peppers, bitter melon, ginseng, turmeric and tea extracts [44,45,46,47,48,49]. Therefore, the combinational intake of these foods or synergistic efficacy of these phyto compounds will be a future research area in the diabetic disease models. Even though these phyto compounds showed multiple beneficial effects in various in vitro studies, their extraction method limits their actions in their bioactivity of these compounds. A few of those novel technologies used in the extraction of those bioactive compounds and their roles in the anti-diabetic activity are discussed below.",
        "World Health Organization (WHO) reported that more than 25,000 medicinally valuable plants exist in different countries including in both developing and developed countries. The principal steps to exploit the bioactive phyto-compounds from natural resources are solvent extraction, bioassays, isolation, and characterization, toxicological, preclinical and clinical investigation of bioactive phyto-compound.",
        "We need to establish the different appropriate methods to investigate the biological properties of phyto compounds from the natural products, and these biological assays are required to identify and isolate the bioactive compounds present in the extract. The entire in vitro biological assay is very reliable and a simple method to get to know the biological activities of extracts, and it may differ based on the targeted diseases like anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, anti-inflammation, anti-malarial, anti-microbial and toxicity studies.",
        "Extraction from the natural products is the first step to screen the biological activities of extracts and identify the bioactive compounds for further isolation, identification and characterization. These steps include washing and drying the raw materials, and blending to obtain the powder and using a different solvent system to extract the crude extract to investigate its biological activities [50,51].",
        "Appropriate extraction methods should be used to ensure that potential bioactive constituents are not lost, distorted or destroyed during the preparation of the crude extract from samples [40]. The selection of a suitable solvent system basically depends on the physical nature of the bioactive compound being targeted as various solvent systems are available to extract/identify the bioactive compound from natural products. The hydrophilic compound extraction, mainly of polar solvents including methanol, ethanol or ethyl-acetate, and for lipophilic compounds extraction, dichloromethane or mixtures of dichloromethane/methanol in the ratio of 1:1, was used to identify the compounds [52].",
        "Recently, various modern extraction techniques were used by natural products based researchers, which include solid-phase micro-extraction, supercritical-fluid extraction, pressurized-liquid extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, and surfactant-mediated techniques. These modern extraction techniques have a lot of advantages including the decrease in organic solvent consumption and in sample stability, removal of unwanted samples clean-up and solvent concentration steps before chromatographic separation, improvement in extraction productivity, selectivity, kinetics of extraction. The exhaustive extraction method is also one of the most efficient extraction methods, and it is mostly carried out with different solvent systems of increasing polarity in order to extract the most bioactive components with significant biological properties. Based on the advantages of these modern techniques, researchers have used these techniques to identify the bioactive compounds more efficiently [53].",
        "Effective identification and isolation of bioactive compounds from natural products are mainly subject to the type of solvent used in the extraction methods. The solvent selection will also depend on the polarity of targeted bioactive compounds to be extracted from natural products [54]. Moreover, the molecular similarity between solvent and solute, mass transfer, use of co-solvent method, toxicity nature, ease of solvent evaporation at low temperature, stability, and inability to cause the extract to composite or dissociate. The choice of solvent selection was affected by other factors such as the amount of phytocompounds to be extracted, the frequency of extraction, the variety of phytocompounds to be extracted, ease of successive handling of the crude extracts and cost effectiveness.",
        "Extraction of the bioactive compounds from the anti-diabetic plants showed a crucial step in determining the antidiabetic activity of the phyto extracts with higher yield and greater potency of those extracts. For the higher yield extraction of the compounds, several factors need to be considered in conventional technologies such as the type of sample, solvent, mixture of those solvents [55]. In order to overcome several difficulties in conventional technologies includes higher use of organic solvents and sample degradation, several modern technologies serve as an alternative for the extraction of those bioactive compounds from antidiabetic plants. Those technologies include but are not limited to ultrasound extraction, microwave-assisted extraction and supercritical extraction. These technologies overcome the conventional technologies by reducing organic solvents usages, higher yield and elimination of unwanted compounds from the extract and showed the greater antidiabetic efficiency of those phyto bioactive compounds [53].",
        "Ultra sound extraction technology is one of the most modern technologies frequently used in the extraction of phyto bioactive compounds from antidiabetic plants with enhanced anti-diabetic bioactivities [56]. This technology enhances the extraction yield with many highly stable bioactive compounds from the antidiabetic plants by the enhanced cell penetrating effect of solvents and breaking of the intramolecular forces through high intensity sound waves [56,57]. The main advantage of these techniques is that they can able to extract the maximum bioactive compounds with limited raw material and shorter time. Recently, polysaccharides from mulberry fruits were extracted using ultrasound technology at an extraction time of about 75 min, produced an extraction yield of about 3.13%, and showed higher anti-glycemic activity by stronger α-glucosidase inhibition activity [58]. Similarly, higher extraction yield of total polyphenol was also obtained by ultrasound assisted extraction of guava leaves extract with higher anti-hyperglycemic activity than acarbose [56]. Likewise, the higher extraction yield of α-glucosidase enzyme was also obtained in the guava leaves with maximum antihyperglycemic activities. Similarly anthocyanins extraction yield increases using ultrasound assisted extraction of bilberry, blackberry and mulberry fruits. The extraction yield of those anthocyanins reached a maximum of up to 2800 mg/L. These extracts showed enhanced anti hyperglycemic activity in the diabetic rats [57]. In another study, the antidiabetic activity of the Pterocarpus marsupium Roxb. Heartwood can be enhanced with ultrasound extraction with the higher protection of the phyto bioactive compounds than other conventional methods in alloxan induced antidiabetic rats [59]. From all of these studies, it was confirmed that extraction yield of the phyto bioactive compounds can be enhanced through the ultrasound extraction technologies, and it also opens ways for the researchers to use these non-conventional technologies for the higher extraction of the bioactive compounds from the anti-diabetics plants.",
        "Microwave assisted extraction is another novel technology currently used in the extraction of phyto bioactive compounds from various medicinal plants like ginger, tea, mango, sapotta [60,61,62,63,64,65] and other herbs proven to have antidiabetic activities. The microwave technology is highly used in the extraction of phyto bioactive compounds with lesser degradation of those compounds, higher extraction yield and cost effectiveness than other conventional technologies. Recently, antidiabetic activity of microwave assisted extraction of Solanum nigrum leaves was studied and found that higher extraction yield of Solanum nigrum leaves extract were obtained using microwave assisted extraction with a yield of 64%. The antidiabetic activities of those extracts were found to be dose dependent. Higher and medium doses were found to have a greater antidiabetic effect. In addition, for the extraction of the bioactive compounds, drying using the microwave technology also enhances the extraction yield of the phyto bioactive compounds. Recently, leaves of Aquilaria subintegra and Aquilaria malaccensis were dried using microwaves and were found to increase the yield of bioactive compounds with enhancing antidiabetic activity [66]. In addition to the extraction and antidiabetic study of the phyto bioactive compounds, several phyto bioactive compounds were studied for the effective extraction using microwave assisted extraction technology with higher extraction yield [67,68]. However, their efficacy in various diabetic models is still limited. This will provide a new research scope about the role of microwave technology in extraction and bioactivity against various diabetic models in near future.",
        "Supercritical fluid extraction technology is one of the novel technologies for the extraction of phyto bioactive compounds from the antidiabetic plants [69,70,71,72] with possible application of those ingredients in the developments of the functional foods and pharmaceutical industries. This technology has several advantages over conventional technologies like higher yield, and multiple compounds can be extracted from this technology, and it can ultimately lead to multiple health benefits of those products developed using these extracts. In addition, this technology has several other advantages including the low viscosity of supercritical fluid that leads to multiple extractions, less solvent residue, and faster extraction process [72]. Recently, various non-polar constituents from Toona sinensis leaves were extracted using supercritical fluid extraction technology and found 24 different active compounds. The major compound in those extractions was that of phytol which possesses greater antidiabetic activity along with the prevention of hepatosteatosis [72]. The same research group also checked for the commercial essential oils obtained by a supercritical extraction process showed greater antidiabetic activity owing to the higher non polar constituents. Similarly, bixin, a colored pigment that possesses anti-hyperglycemic activity, was obtained by a supercritical extraction process with higher yield [73]. Several bioactive compounds can also be effectively extracted from the anti-diabetic plants such as ginseng, turmeric, but their active role in the diabetic model of supercritical extracted compounds is still yet to be elucidated.",
        "Overall, modern extraction processes such as ultrasounds, microwaves, and supercritical fluid extraction process can efficiently extract various phyto bioactive compounds with higher extraction yield, faster process, and lesser thermal degradation, possessing multiple benefits in anti-diabetic activity. However, certain modern equipment is cost effective such as the supercritical fluid extraction process, requires much space, and needs to be considered in future. Table 1 illustrates the modern extraction techniques used for the preparation of bioactive compounds from medicinal plants.",
        "Purification of bioactive compounds from crude extracts is an important task, as purified compounds are much more therapeutically effective. Recent modern techniques have created numerous ways for the purification and large-scale production of several bioactive compounds [77]. The plant crude extracts generally occur as a combination of various categories of bioactive compounds with different polarities, hence different levels of chromatographic separations are used to purify the bioactive compounds including Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), Column Chromatography and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). These chromatographic techniques are still used to purify/isolate the bioactive compounds due to various advantages including convenience, and availability of the variety of stationary phases for separation of active phytochemicals [75,76].",
        "Mainly, TLC has been used to the fraction of different components from natural products and this technique shortens the process of isolation and identification of bioactive compound [74]. HPLC is one of the important widely used purification techniques for the isolation of natural products followed by TLC and other chromatographic techniques [78]. Presently, HPLC is gaining popularity among other analytical chromatographic techniques as the key choice for phytocompound fingerprinting. The bioactive molecules are often existing only as a minor component in the crude extract and the determination ability of HPLC is ideally suited to the quick processing of multicomponent natural products based samples on both an analytical and preparative scale [79].",
        "Apart from HPLC, there are other alternative analytical methods employed to identify phytocompounds, among which is the diode array detector (DAD) coupled with a mass spectrometer (MS), liquid chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS and GC/MS) [79,80]. These alternative analytical methods provide abundant useful information for structural elucidation and identification of the bioactive compounds when tandem mass spectrometry (MS) is applied. Thus, the combination of HPLC with MS facilitates prompt and more accurate identification of phytocompounds from natural products sample.",
        "LC-NMR is the combination of chromatographic separation and structural elucidation of an unknown compound and mixture. It is the one of the most powerful and a time saving method to isolate the structures of interested molecules [81]. The current introduction of a pulsed field gradient technique in high resolution NMR, together with a three-dimensional technique enhances application in structure elucidation and molecular weight information. These new hyphenated techniques are valuable in the regions of pharmacokinetics, toxicity studies, drug metabolism and drug discovery process [82].",
        "The isolated and purified phytocompound needs to be structurally determined to analyze the chemical properties of the compound. This process involves accumulating information from a wide range of spectroscopic techniques, including UV-visible spectroscopy, Infra-Red (IR), and NMR, which provides a certain clue regarding the structure of the isolated/purified molecule. Characteristics of the isolated phyto-compound can be analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy and the IR spectroscopy technique has proven to be a precious tool for the characterization and identification of compounds and/or its functional groups (chemical bonds) present in an unidentified mixture of the natural products extract [83]. The identification of functional groups in a compound may be detected using IR by analyzing the different bonds present.",
        "NMR spectroscopy is the most unswerving tool for the elucidation of molecular structures. An NMR microscope defines the number and types of nuclei in an organic molecule, describing the individual chemical environment and their interconnection. Swotting the molecule of interest with NMR spectroscopy permits the determination of differences in the magnetic properties of the various magnetic nuclei present and atoms are present in neighboring groups [84,85].",
        "The chemical substances from living organisms are identified as natural compounds. The primary sources of natural compounds are plants. Plant synthesize diverse groups of natural compounds, commonly referred to as secondary metabolites and their function in plants is now attracting attention because of their use as dyes, glues, oils, waxes, flavoring agents, drugs and perfumes, and they are noticed as potential sources of natural drugs, antibiotics, insecticides and herbicides, etc. [7,86]. Currently, the role of some secondary metabolites as protective dietary elements has become a progressively vital area in human nutrition based research. Evidence affirms that modest long-term intakes can have favorable impacts on the incidence of many chronic inflammatory associated diseases/disorders, including T2DM (Table 2) [7,87].",
        "Based on their biosynthetic origins, plant secondary metabolites can be divided into three major groups such as (i) phenolic compounds; (ii) terpenoids and (iii) nitrogen-containing alkaloids and sulphur-containing compounds. Compared to another group of secondary metabolites, phenolic compounds are largely responsible for beneficial effects on human health [88], and these naturally occurring compounds are found largely in fruits, vegetables, cereals and beverages [89]. The content of the polyphenols in a plant is greatly affected by environmental factors like sun exposure, soil types, rainfall and stress, etc. [90,91]. Phenolics that are not soluble are found in cell walls, while soluble phenolics are present within the plant cell vacuoles (Figure 2) [92]. Phenols are classified into different groups as a function of the number of phenol rings in the structure and their main classes include phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes and lignans.",
        "Two classes of phenolic acids are derivatives of benzoic acid and cinnamic acid. The hydroxybenzoic acid content of edible plants is generally very low, with the exception of certain red fruits, black radishes, and onions. Because these hydroxybenzoic acids, both free and esterified, are found in only a few plants eaten by humans, they have not been extensively studied and are not currently considered to be of great nutritional interest. The hydroxycinnamic acids are more common than are the hydroxybenzoic acids and consist chiefly of p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids. These acids are rarely found in the free form, except in processed food that has undergone freezing, sterilization, or fermentation [93].",
        "Favonoids comprise the most studied group of polyphenols. Flavonoids may be divided into six subclasses: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavanols, anthocyanins and isoflavones based on the variation in the type of heterocycle involved. They are typically found in the form of glycosides and sometimes as acylglycosides, while acylated, methylated and sulfate molecules are less frequent and in lower concentrations. They are water-soluble and accumulate in cell vacuoles [88].",
        "Stilbenes are a subgroup of non-flavonoid polyphenols with two phenyl moieties connected by a two-carbon methylene bridge and are found in low quantities in the human diet. One of these is resveratrol, and the protective effect of this molecule is unlikely at normal nutritional intakes [94].",
        "Lignins fall under the subgroup of non-flavonoid polyphenols. They are diphenolic compounds that contain a 2,3-dibenzylbutane structure that is formed by the dimerization of two cinnamic acid residues. Several lignans, such as secoisolariciresinol, are the richest dietary source of linseed. They are considered to be phytoestrogens [95].",
        "Diabetes has been recognized as an oxidative stress based disorder caused by an imbalance between the cellular production of reactive oxygen species and the counteracting antioxidant mechanisms by body’s natural antioxidants [126]. Studies have suggested that oxidative stress are enacted in systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, impaired secretion of pancreatic β-cells and glucose utilization in peripheral tissues that lead to long-term secondary complications [127]. Growing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests a positive association between reduction in the incidence diabetes and the consumption of a diet rich in phenols [128]. Several biological beneficial properties have been documented for dietary phenols including antioxidant [129], anti-allergic [130], anti-viral [131], anti-microbial [132], anti-proliferative [133], anti-carcinogenic [134], free radical scavenging [135] and regulation of cell cycle arrest [136].",
        "Phenol-rich foods increase plasma antioxidant capacity, and this incidence may be explained by acceptance of electron from reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus forming relatively stable phenoxyl radicals (Clifford). ROS are considered to be a toxic byproduct, pose a threat to cells by causing peroxidation of lipids, oxidation of proteins, and damage to nucleic acids, enzyme inhibition, activation of a programmed cell death (PCD) pathway, and ultimately lead to death of the cells [137]. Phenols, therefore, protect cell constituents against oxidative damage and limit the risk of various degenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress. Likewise, inflammation and stress are both responsible for the pathogenesis of T2DM, suggesting the potential importance of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory alternatives [138]. The phenolic compounds with potent anti-oxidant activity are capable of exhibiting anti-inflammatory activity, with the potential to prevent DM and its complications. The current review is an attempt to provide a description of various plants’ derived phenolic compounds currently used for treatment, and inhibition of inflammatory pathways that are important in diabetic prevention strategies.",
        "Apigenin is a natural flavonoid abundantly present in common fruits and vegetables (Figure 3) [139]. Apigenin as a therapeutic agent for various inflammatory diseases inhibits TNF-α and IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB via ERK1/2 activation. Apigenin attenuates production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α through modulating multiple intracellular signaling pathways in macrophages, which ameliorated hyperglycemic and improved antioxidants via oxidative stress-related signaling [97].",
        "Diosmin is a naturally occurring flavonoid, abundant in the pericarp of various citrus fruits (Figure 4) [140]. Excessive production of free fatty acids (hyperglycaemia) has previously been shown to cause inflammation leading to mitochondrial DNA damage and pancreatic cell malfunctioning [141]. Antioxidant supplementation by diosmin suppressed diabetes induced ROS resulting in deactivation of NF-κB associated pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines such as macrophage chemotactic protein (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and interleukins (IL-1β and 6) [98].",
        "Quercetin is found in a great variety of food, including vegetables, tea, apples, grapevines, berries, broccoli, red onions and capers (Figure 5) [142]. Inflammatory mediators can activate a number of receptors, which subsequently result in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, insulin signaling impairment, endothelial dysfunction and altered vascular flow that lead to diabetic vascular complications [143]. CRP, a marker of systemic inflammation, and markers of endothelial dysfunction have been reported in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients [144]. Quercetin administrations protect against diabetes-induced exaggerated vasoconstriction. These effects resulted from the reduction in serum level of both TNF-α and CRP and inhibition of aortic NF-kβ in both models of diabetes [100].",
        "Kaempferol is a natural flavonol, relatively abundant in grapefruit, tea cruciferous vegetables and some edible berries (Figure 6) [145]. Previous findings showed that antioxidant content of Kaempferol reduced IL-1β, TNF-α [101], and kaempferol was also reported to significantly decrease the fasting blood glucose and improve insulin resistance. Anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic effects of kaempferol are mediated by through AMPK activation [102].",
        "Eriodictyol is a bitter-masking flavanone extracted from lemon, Indian beech and rose hips. Eriodictyol has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties, by significantly lower retinal TNF-α, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and endothelial NOS (eNOS) (Figure 7) [104]. Supplementation with eriodictyol suppressed diabetes with upregulation of mRNA expression of PPARγ2 and adipocyte-specific fatty acid-binding protein as well as the protein levels of PPARγ2 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, eriodictyol reactivated Akt in HepG2 cells with HG-induced insulin resistance [103].",
        "Naringenin is a flavonoid found in fruits including grapefruit, oranges, and tomatoes with robust antioxidant potential (Figure 8) [146]. Naringenin was also found to prevent reactivity in diabetic via upregulation of both 5′ AMPK. Stimulation of innate immunity by high blood glucose, induce inflammation and lead to type 2 diabetes [147]. Naringenin administration upregulates the activation of the AMPK pathway and then increases glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity [106].",
        "Hesperidin is a flavanone glycoside found in citrus fruits, orange, and lemon (Figure 9) [148]. Hesperidin attenuates the diabetic condition through control over hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia by downregulation of free radical generation, and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Reduced oxidative stress by hesperidin due to strong antioxidant capacity was also found to be helpful in the prevention of damage caused by oxygen free radicals of cellular organelles and its related enzymes and development of insulin resistance [108].",
        "Baicalein, a flavonoid, was originally isolated from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis, Scutellaria lateriflora and fruits of Oroxylum indicum (Figure 10) [149]. Baicalein was reported to suppress the activation of NF-κB, and decrease expression of iNOS and TGF-β1, which support its anti-inflammatory property [110]. Baicalein displayed significant improvement in hyperglycemia, glucose tolerance, and insulin levels. Mechanism of its action was by upregulation of AMPK and its related signal pathway, a regulator of metabolic homeostasis involving inflammation and oxidative stress. Activated AMPK could abolish inflammation through the MAPK signaling pathway. Activated AMPK could attenuate insulin resistance by phosphorylating IRS-1, AKT and dephosphorylate ERK, JNK and NF-κB. It also suppresses fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis and increases mitochondrial β-oxidation [111].",
        "Chrysin is a naturally occurring flavonoid and is found in honey, propolis, fruits, vegetables, beverages and medicinal plants such as Passiflora caerulea, Pelargonium peltatum and Tilia tomentosa Moench (Figure 11) [150]. According to Ahad et al. [112], treatment with chrysin reduced the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-6. Consequently, chrysin prevents the development of diabetes through anti-inflammatory effects, specifically targeting the TNF-α pathway.",
        "Catechin is a flavonol, and high concentrations of catechin can be found in grapes, berries, apples, dark chocolate, ginger, tea and cocoa (Figure 12) [151]. Chronic nutrient surplus and excessive energy balance activate stress in adipose tissue leading to stimulation of the innate immunity defense [152], and provoke inflammation to protect the organism against cellular damage and pathogen invasion. Chronic inflammation can aggravate diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis [147]. Catechin effectively suppresses the activation of NF-κB system through inhibition of the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), specifically into the adipose tissue [114,153,154]. The inhibitory effects of Catechin on the oxidative-inflammatory loop contribute to its therapeutic efficacies against diabetes.",
        "Morin, a major active component of traditional medicinal herbs from almond, guajava (common guava) and wine (Figure 13) [155]. A study demonstrates that management of diabetes with morin reduced the elevation of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α via a SphK1/S1P signaling pathway. This activity supports its anti-inflammatory property and possible beneficial effects in diabetes [116]. Subsequently, treatment with morin expressively abridged the blood glucose, glucose metabolic enzymes and improved the production of insulin levels in the diabetes model [117].",
        "Genisteins are mainly isolated from soybeans and other legumes, such as chickpeas, contain small amounts of genistein (Figure 14) [156]. Diabetic retinopathy is affiliate with microglial activation and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α). This inflammatory signal involves the activation of tyrosine kinase and its subsequent events, ERK and p38 MAPK pathways. These effects of diabetes in retinas were reduced by intervention treatment with genistein. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, represses the release of TNF-α and significantly inhibits ERK and P38 phosphorylation in activated microglial cells [118,157,158].",
        "Curcumin is the major active component of turmeric, and it is one of the polyphenol compounds that exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumorigenic, and antimicrobial properties (Figure 15). Hyperglycemia-induced ROS can stimulate NF-κB activation which then causes the increase in vascular adhesion molecule expression (ICAM-1), which plays a central role in diabetic vascular inflammation [159]. Overexpression of their adhesive capability (ICAM-1) is considered as the main event in the development of atherosclerosis associated diabetes [160]. Curcumin supplementation ameliorates diabetic vascular inflammation through the decrease in ROS overproduction and ICAM-1 expressions [120].",
        "Colchicine was originally extracted from the Colchicum autumnale (Colchicaceae) plant and also contained in the corms of Colchicum luteum, and the seeds of Gloriosa superba (Figure 16). Colchicine is traditionally considered the staple therapy for inflammatory diseases such as gout and pericarditis [161]. Elevated infiltration of inflammatory cells in renal tubulointerstitium is commonly seen in diabetic nephropathy patients [162]. Chemokines and adhesion molecules such as monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) expression are increased in diabetes nephropathy. Colchicine supplementation mitigates inflammatory cell infiltration in diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting MCP-1 and ICAM-1 expression [121].",
        "Resveratrol is a type of natural phenol compound, and a high concentration of resveratrol is found in the skin and seeds of grapes, peanuts and ground nuts (Figure 17) [161]. Diabetes is usually associated with inflammation, and an excess level of glucose is shunted via alternative pathways, which, in turn, leads to an increase in TGF-β1 and NF-κB (inflammatory mediators). Upregulation of NF-κB is convoyed by the COX-2 [163] enzyme, and it is responsible for the production of prostaglandins, inflammatory mediators produced by activated macrophages/monocytes as well as microglia in the neuroinflammatory diseases [164]. Administration of resveratrol significantly ameliorated diabetes inflammation [123] by acting as a potent scavenger of ROS, which deters lipid peroxidation, which is induced by oxidative stress [165]. In addition, resveratrol attenuates the activation of immune cells and release of pro-inflammatory mediators through the inhibition of NF-κB, followed by downregulated COX-2 gene expression in the diabetic model [123].",
        "Emodin is a major active component from Aloe vera, kiwi fruits, lettuce and banana. Emodin exerts anti-inflammatory effect via suppressing the activation of NF-κB in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Figure 18) [166]. In addition, Emodin proved to have antidiabetic properties via inhibiting the degradation of IκB, an inhibitory subunit of NF-κB. When added, emodin also downmodulated adhesion molecules like ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 contains NF-κB binding sites in their promoter region in endothelial cells that could reduce the impact of type 2 diabetes [124,125].",
        "Bioavailability is defined as substances obtained from ingested materials that reach circulatory systems for further delivery into designated tissues so that the beneficial compounds are biologically available for exerting healthy functions. The normal routes of dietary phytochemicals thus include ingestion, digestions, and transport across gastrointestinal epithelium prior to circulatory vessels. Phytochemicals are located inside vacuoles and cell walls of plant cells. Most cell wall materials are indigestible by human enzymic systems. Therefore, digestibility of the phytochemicals is of great interest or reveals how the phytochemicals can affect human health and fight or prevent diseases [167].",
        "The processing factors (food texture, e.g., heat, temperature, or pressure application) can impinge on the bioaccessibility (fraction of a compound that is released from the matrix and potentially available for further uptake and absorption) of bioactivity [168]. The elimination of a natural barrier of the cell wall yields a better release of phytocompounds. For example, more phenolic is obtained from tomato juice than those from dried and fresh tomato, indicating that the natural barrier of the cell wall has been eliminated. In contrast, chlorogenic acid is present in fresh products, but it gradually disappears in juice. This could be caused by the different extractability due to different matrices of the products or by chemical changes due to processing and digestion environments [169].",
        "Compounds that are free from cell wall materials show clearer responses during gastrointestinal digestion. Phenolic stability is strongly affected by pH. For example, flavonols and proanthocyanidins remain intact, but they may also be broken down when pH is sufficiently low in the stomach. pH higher than 7.4 is unfavorable for phenolics, and the effects of high pH are worsened by lengthy exposures. This results from oxidation further into diketones and other degradation products. The number of –OH groups in benzene rings of simple phenolics can also be critical clues for phenolic stability [170].",
        "Most absorptive tissues are comprised of epithelial cells that protect the human body from hazardous components in ingested foods. There is no well-established molecular form of absorbed substances in the gastrointestinal tract, i.e., whether they are absorbed intact or as metabolites. The influence of enzyme concentrations, solubility, pH, and time of digestion all play a role and influence bioaccessibility and absorption [171].",
        "For example, the release of carotenoids increases significantly in intestinal digestion where bile extract and pancreatic secretions exist. Consecutive gastrointestinal digestions do not help with higher release of carotenoids. This is more likely due to insufficient emulsifier–water ratios to provide emulsification of carotenoids that are fat-soluble [172].",
        "Phytochemicals bioavailability is strongly dependent on cell wall compositions of the food matrices they originate from, the structural chemistry of the phytochemicals, history of processing, and the individual human gastrointestinal system. This factor greatly alters the structure and profile and thus the potential bioactivity of many plant compounds that are not absorbed in the small intestine. These complexities determine the dietary phytochemicals plan that should be recommended in order to reach biologically-safe active dosages [173].",
        "Inflammation emerges to contribute to the pathogenesis of T2DM and its secondary complications, particularly in cardiovascular disease. Various researchers have investigated the underlying mechanisms that initiate inflammation and link it to insulin resistance and associated complications. These investigations may provide new opportunities for treating type 2 diabetic patients and its complications. Most of the anti-diabetic drugs have the ability to control the glucose level and improve insulin secretion through anti-inflammatory mechanisms, but they have few undesirable effects based on the preclinical and clinical investigations. The current investigations have suggested that natural products derived bioactive compounds act as a therapeutic tool in chronic inflammatory diseases. Mostly, polyphenols appear to be significant metabolic modulators by virtue of their capability to influence various cellular and molecular pathway targets, which have been proven as potential targets for the polyphenolic group of compounds. Nevertheless, clinical use of natural products based active compounds has not yet been investigated properly through intracellular signaling pathways. Further research will be needed to fully explain the cellular and molecular mechanisms of actions of natural products’ derived compounds and their analogues in several physiological processes, in order to yield essential insights into their prophylactic and therapeutic uses.",

However, most anti-diabetic drugs cannot be used in patients with hepatic dysfunction, renal disease, and heart disease, which makes pharmacological therapy of type 2 diabetes complicated. Despite continued introduction of novel agents, the search for an ideal drug that is useful as both a hypoglycemic agent and to reduce diabetes-related complications remains elusive. Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid extract that has shown promise as a hypoglycemic agent in the management of diabetes in animal and human studies. Mechanistic studies have revealed beneficial effects of berberine on diabetes-related complications. Although there have been few clinical reports of the anti-diabetic effects of berberine, little documentation of adverse effects in humans positions it as a potential candidate drug to treat type 2 diabetes. In the present review, the anti-diabetic mechanism of berberine, its effect on diabetes-related complications, and its recent use in human clinical studies is highlighted.

        "Diabetes mellitus (DM) encompasses a group of clinical syndromes caused by genetic, environmental, and other factors, primarily characterized by hyperglycemia. This condition arises from insufficient insulin secretion and/or impaired insulin action, caused by glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism disorders. Diabetes can be categorized into type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), based on differences in pathogenesis, symptoms, complications, and treatment strategies (Table 1). With increasing population aging and lifestyle changes, the prevalence of DM is increasing dramatically worldwide (Diabetesatlas, 2021). Based on projections, the number of individuals with DM will increase to 642.8 million by 2030 and 783.7 million by 2045 (Collaborators, 2023). Patients with DM face a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared with those without DM, and they often experience these complications earlier in life (Heather et al., 2022). In addition, extensive cohort observational studies conducted over the last 30 years have confirmed that 49% of DM-related deaths are due to cardiovascular disease (Chiquette and Chilton, 2002; Tamayo et al., 2023). Patients with T2DM exhibited a considerably increased lifetime risk of various cardiovascular conditions, which may include coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral artery disease (Marx et al., 2023). The rising morbidity associated with DM, coupled with cardiovascular complications resulting from long-term hyperglycemia, leads to disability and mortality among patients. This situation has become a pressing public health issue, posing a serious threat to human health (Lopez-Diez et al., 2021).",
        "List of diabetes classification and its conditions.",
        "Cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells are important structural components of the heart and blood vessels. The mechanisms by which long-term hyperglycemia induces cardiomyopathy in DM include at least three key aspects: 1) hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress promotes the excessive release of reactive oxygen species, which in turn induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis, 2) the oxidative stress may also result in persistent inflammatory damage to blood vessels, thereby increasing the risk of diabetic cardiomyopathy, and 3) hyperglycemia adversely affects protein structure. Studies have shown that hyperglycemia can alter protein structures, leading to the cross-linking of collagen molecules. This alteration impairs the degradation ability of collagen, resulting in increased myocardial fibrosis and infarction (Dal Canto et al., 2023; Stultz and Edelman, 2003). The mechanisms underlying DM-induced chronic hyperglycemia and its associated cardiovascular complications are complex. First, the normal vascular endothelium serves as the body’s natural physical barrier, which can weaken the adhesion of substances such as leukocytes and platelets. However, when endothelial cells are damaged, adhesion molecules become highly expressed, and chemokines are secreted, promoting the adhesion, rolling, and infiltration of leukocytes and platelets into the intimal layer, thus inducing atherosclerosis (Li Y. et al., 2023). Second, high levels of blood glucose are catalyzed by aldose reductase and other enzymes, resulting in the production of fructose and sorbitol, which accumulate outside the endothelial cells. This increase in extracellular osmotic pressure disrupts the internal environment, leading to endothelial cell degeneration, edema, and vascular diseases (Katakami, 2018). In addition, high blood glucose levels damage the inhibitory effect of the renin-angiotensin system, promoting sodium retention, causing insulin resistance (IR), and resulting in hyperinsulinemia. These changes activate the sympathetic nervous system, contributing to hypertension (Jia and Sowers, 2021). Studies have found that the incidence of hypertension in patients with DM is approximately two to six times higher than in those without DM (Lithovius et al., 2020; Wang B. et al., 2022). Chronic hyperglycemia in DM results in a decrease in insulin efficiency in promoting glucose uptake and utilization, alongside a reduction in insulin sensitivity, also known as IR. IR can decrease endothelium-dependent vasodilation response (Fan et al., 2024). The role of vascular endothelium in regulating blood vessel movement is impaired when vascular endothelial dysfunction occurs. Consequently, blood vessel wall elasticity decreases and plaques gradually form on the vessel walls, exacerbating conditions such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, and congestive heart failure. Furthermore, DM is a recognized risk factor for coronary artery disease and is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and mortality among patients (Association, 2019; Baena-Diez et al., 2016). Statistically, the mortality rate from coronary heart disease in patients with T2DM is two to four times higher than that in patients without DM (Benjamin et al., 2019). In terms of treatment, compared with patients with non-DM-related cardiovascular complications, patients with DM-related cardiovascular complications are less likely to opt for surgical interventions. This is primarily because of the limitations posed by anesthesia evaluation and surgical contraindications. Therefore, exploring and identifying suitable drugs for the prevention and treatment of DM and cardiovascular complications (DACC) is essential.",
        "Currently, several drugs are used to treat DACC. For example, statins, antilipids, and antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin and clopidogrel) can delay further narrowing of the coronary arteries. When angina symptoms arise from coronary ischemia, nitrates can be used to dilate the blood vessels and improve symptoms. However, each of these medications has various side effects, which may exacerbate long-term complications associated with chronic conditions such as DACC (Table 2). Metformin is one of the most commonly prescribed medications for DM globally. Studies have shown that metformin causes serious gastrointestinal side effects (Dixon et al., 2023). Statins used to treat DACC are associated with an increased risk of developing T2DM (Laakso and Fernandes Silva, 2023). Table 2 outlines the side effects of other commonly used medications. Therefore, it is crucial to identify effective drugs, have fewer side effects, and can contribute to optimizing treatment plans.",
        "Adverse reactions or side effects of commonly used drugs for diabetes and its cardiovascular complications.",
        "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gained popularity as a treatment method for chronic diseases in recent years. TCM typically includes TCM compound prescriptions, botanical drugs, and individual botanical drugs components. Compared with standard biomedical treatments, patients benefit from TCM’s “holistic concept,” as well as the characteristics of natural products and lower toxicity. Numerous basic studies have explored TCM’s efficacy in treating DACC (Liu et al., 2023; Song Z. et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2022). Studies have confirmed that TCM can be used as a complementary treatment method for patients with DM and coronary heart disease (Wei Y. et al., 2022). Although high-quality clinical studies on TCM for the treatment of DACC remain limited, some key studies have provided valuable and compelling evidence for its application. For instance, the MUST-D study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IV trial, enrolled 716 patients with DM-related coronary heart disease from 97 tertiary hospitals in China (Zhou J. et al., 2023). The study found that the treatment group with Shexiang Baoxin pills was highly effective in reducing the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Compared with the control group, the incidence of MACEs in the Shexiang Baoxin pill treatment group decreased by 45.8%. Moreover, at 24 months, the overall incidence of secondary endpoints (composite outcome of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization due to unstable angina or heart failure, and coronary angioplasty) significantly decreased by 32.3%. In addition, the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events in the Shexiang Baoxin pill group (4.4%) was lower than that in the placebo group (7.7%), demonstrating its safety. TCM has also shown remarkable potential in pre-DM intervention. The FOCUS randomized clinical trial included 885 patients with impaired glucose tolerance, abdominal obesity, or any abnormal index of metabolic syndrome (Ji et al., 2024). The results revealed that the risk of DM in the Jinlida Granule group significantly decreased by 41% and had prominent advantages in improving multiple metabolic indices (waist circumference, body mass index, blood glucose, blood lipids, and insulin resistance index). These results reveal the potential of TCM in pre-DM intervention and the improvement of metabolic disorders, providing solid evidence for the further application of TCM for DM prevention and treatment. Furthermore, regarding the treatment of DM complicated by coronary heart disease, a treatment regimen combining Tongxinluo, Jinlida, and metoprolol also presents promising application prospects. One study indicated that the total effective rate of the combined treatment group was significantly higher than that of the single metoprolol treatment group and surpassed the control group in terms of improving cardiac function indices (such as cardiac stroke volume and left ventricular ejection fraction) and blood glucose control (Yujun et al., 2020). Numerous small-sample clinical trials have demonstrated that TCM plays a crucial role in the treatment of DACC (Lili and Yan, 2025; Zhaolong, 2025). For instance, in a study investigating the impact of Danhu Tongbi Decoction on patients with T2DM complicated by coronary heart disease and angina pectoris, the control group received conventional treatment. In contrast, the observation group received Danhu Tongbi Decoction. The results showed that the observation group showed more significant improvements in glycometabolic and lipid-metabolic indices (including blood glucose and lipid levels). Furthermore, there was a notable enhancement in cardiac function, as measured by the left ventricular ejection fraction, and both the frequency and severity of angina attacks were better alleviated (Lili and Yan, 2025). Another study evaluating the efficacy of naoxintong in treating diabetes mellitus complicated by stroke classified patients into control and treatment groups. In addition to the conventional treatment, the treatment group received naoxintong. After a period of treatment, this group showed more substantial improvements in the neurological deficit score, better blood glucose control, and an increase in the daily activity of living ability scores (Zhaolong, 2025). A large number of small-sample clinical studies are sufficient to confirm the therapeutic value of TCM. These findings established a solid foundation for the promotion and communication of TCM in the international DACC field. To reduce the side effects of standard biomedical treatments and increase their efficacy, some studies have used a combination of TCM and standard biomedical treatments. Wang et al. (Wang H. et al., 2024) selected Jinghong Decoction combined with metformin sustained-release tablets for the syndrome differentiation treatment of T2DM. They found that patients’ symptoms improved significantly and adverse reactions were reduced. In summary, by consolidating research progress on TCM compound prescriptions, botanical drugs, and individual monomers aimed at treating DACC in recent years, we aimed to contribute to the development of new effective prevention and treatment strategies.",
        "TCM compound prescriptions show the characteristics of multiple targets and mechanisms in the treatment of diseases owing to their complex components. In this study, we summarized the mechanisms through which TCM compound prescriptions function in DACC, including reducing inflammation, regulating immunity, modulating gut microbiota, inhibiting islet cell or cardiovascular cell apoptosis, anti-oxidative stress, regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, and other mechanisms (Table 3).",

        "T1DM arises from an autoimmune attack on the pancreas, leading to the destruction of insulin-secreting β-cells. Immune system cells contribute to β-cell death through various mechanisms, including triggering inflammation. Some researchers describe T1DM as a “chronic anti-auto-inflammatory response,” and there is a theory suggesting that pancreatic inflammation may be the most important cause of T1DM (Committee, 2024; Gearty et al., 2022). Once T1DM develops, it can cause inflammation in other parts of the body, which may result from immune response to hyperglycemia (Qi et al., 2022). T2DM has a complex bidirectional relationship with inflammation. T2DM, characterized by IR, can lead to chronic inflammation, which further exacerbates IR, creating a vicious cycle. Chronic and systemic inflammation are the prominent features of T2DM. Excessive cytokines and signaling proteins generated to control inflammation can inadvertently lead to heightened inflammatory responses. In both T1DM and T2DM diabetes, chronic inflammation can lead to DACC such as cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and other cardiovascular diseases (Lorenzo-Almoros et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2023; Poznyak et al., 2020). This underscores the rationale behind targeting inflammation or regulating the immune system as therapeutic strategies for DM. Several TCM compound prescriptions have demonstrated efficacy in addressing these issues. For example, GegenQinlian Decoction, BaihuRenshen Decoction, and Shen-Qi Compound Formula promote glucose absorption and exert hypoglycemic effects in diabetic rats by inhibiting small intestinal inflammation (Xu et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2022; Zhang and Liu, 2024). Jinlida granules and Danggui SiniSan can inhibit islet cell inflammation, enhance islet cell function, and play hypoglycemic roles (Gu et al., 2024; Wu, 2024). The Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi capsule can reduce vascular endothelial inflammation and alleviate DACC (Wang L. et al., 2022). Gelan Xiaoke Pills can enhance the immune function in patients with diabetes, reduce IR, and alleviate diabetes symptoms (Wang M.-C. et al., 2024).",
        "The intestinal flora is often referred to as the “hidden organ” of the human body, that is involved in regulating various biological processes such as energy metabolism and immune inflammatory response, and plays an irreplaceable role in the metabolic health of the body and the occurrence and development of diseases (Drozdz et al., 2021). Under normal physiological conditions, the gut maintains a complete immune barrier. However, this barrier is broken down once hyperglycemia occurs. An imbalance in the intestinal microecology is an important factor that accelerates the occurrence, development, and outcomes of various endocrine and metabolic diseases. Several studies have found that T2DM is often accompanied by intestinal flora disturbances and multiple organ dysfunctions (Mao et al., 2023; Nesci et al., 2023; Zhang and Xie, 2024). The intestinal leakage theory suggests that when the intestinal flora is disturbed, intestinal permeability increases, endotoxin and pro-inflammatory cytokine production increases, energy intake increases, and systemic inflammation and IR are induced (Cristofori et al., 2021; Gonzalez et al., 2019). The “gut-islet axis” is an important endocrine regulation axis of intestinal microecology and intestinal neuroendocrine dialogue with islets. Therefore, it is important to explore functional protective strategies for islet cells within the gut.",
        "Several TCM compound prescriptions, including Gegen Qinlian decoction, Shen Qi compound formula, Coptis saliva root and Ginseng Alph. Wood formula, Tang-ping-san, Qijian mixture, JiangTang San Huang pill, Buyang Huanwu decoction, Chaihu Guizhi Ganjiang decoction, “maccog” TCM tea, Huoxue Jiangtang Decoction and Bupiwei Xieyinhuo Shengyang Decoction can increase the proportion of beneficial bacteria by regulating intestinal flora, and play a role in lowering blood glucose or alleviating diabetes symptoms (Gao et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2023; Huang Q. et al., 2022; Jiang L. et al., 2022; Liu M. et al., 2022; Tawulie et al., 2023; Wang B. et al., 2022; Zhang F. et al., 2024). From the perspective of TCM, the small intestine and the heart are similar to the “gut - spindle.” Long-term dietary changes in patients with pre-DM lead to a structural imbalance of the intestinal flora, which aggravates the changes in metabolic products (mainly trimethylamine oxide, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and lipopolysaccharides) of the flora (Bielka et al., 2022; Bondy, 2023). These substances can enter systemic circulation, damaging the intestinal barrier, and leading to complications such as myocardial fibrosis, vascular inflammation, and other diabetic cardiovascular diseases. This progression can result in poor management of the patient’s condition, uncontrollably and substantially accelerating mortality rates among patients with DM. Therefore, protecting the integrity of the intestinal barrier, improving imbalance of the intestinal flora, and regulating the metabolites of the flora can inhibit inflammatory responses in cardiomyocytes, delaying myocardial fibrosis, and protect cardiomyocytes. Such strategies represent novel auxiliary approaches for the treatment of DACC. Chaihu Guizhi Ganjiang Decoction has been shown to reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic rats by adjusting the absorption of short-chain fatty acids (Li et al., 2024). Bupiwei Xieyinhuo Shengyang Decoction exerts its effect by regulating the metabolites of intestinal flora to lower blood glucose (Yue et al., 2022).",
        "Islet cells form the basis of insulin secretion, and dysfunction in these cells, including the abnormal apoptosis of islet cells caused by various factors, occurs in most patients with DM. Therefore, the development of inhibitors of islet cell apoptosis is considered one of the most effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of DM. According to the TCM theory, jinlidagranules can tonify the spleen and push qi, a fundamental substance or driving force that sustains human life activities in the effect of TCM theory (Gu et al., 2024). Several studies have shown that jinlidagranules exert hypoglycemic effects by inhibiting islet cell apoptosis and enhancing islet function (Gu et al., 2024). Abnormal death of cardiovascular cells, such as cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells, is a major cause of cardiovascular complications in patients with DM. Danggui SiniSan has the functions of nourishing blood and warming the meridian, namely, dispelling cold air in TCM theory (Wu, 2024). Standard biomedical treatment suggests that Danggui SiniSan can promote blood circulation by increasing vital energy, enhancing resistance, and regulating endocrine function. Some studies have shown that it not only enhances islet function by inhibiting islet cell apoptosis, but also protects cardiovascular function (Wu, 2024). Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi capsules can inhibit endothelial cell apoptosis induced by DM, thereby safeguarding cardiovascular function in patients with diabetes (Wang L. et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023).",
        "Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance between oxidation and antioxidant activity, leaning toward oxidative damage. Oxidative stress is mainly involved in DM development through at least three ways: 1) blocking of the insulin action pathway, which leads to IR (Masenga et al., 2023), 2) reducing insulin gene expression, resulting in reduced insulin synthesis and secretion (Hoseini et al., 2022), and 3) promoting islet cell apoptosis (Zhao et al., 2023). Gel XiaokePills can enhance antioxidant capacity and thus reduce IR (Wang J. et al., 2024). In addition, hyperglycemia can induce or aggravate cardiovascular complications in several ways: 1) it directly increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) by aggravating mitochondrial load and the diabetic vascular inflammatory response (Ma X. M. et al., 2023), 2) non-enzyme-catalyzed glycosylation of proteins is enhanced during hyperglycemia. Therefore, the glycosylation of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, inevitably leads to changes in enzyme activity, a decrease in free radical scavenging ability, induction of oxidative stress, and aggravation of DACC (Perrone et al., 2020), 3) hyperglycemia directly induces angiotensin production in muscle cells. Ang II can produce superoxide ions by activating the NADPH/NADH system (Zhang L. et al., 2024). Induction of oxidative stress results in vascular endothelial cell dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases, and 4) it promotes the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (Chen J. W. et al., 2020). Previous studies have shown that the proliferation and migration of these muscle cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (Gong X. et al., 2021; Yan Y. et al., 2021). Recent studies have used TCM to treat different cell types and alleviate DM by affecting the mitochondrial oxidative respiratory chain, showing that oxidative stress has a bidirectional regulatory effect on DACC (Gong X. et al., 2021; Zhang Y. et al., 2024). ShengmaiSan is a combination of three important components that alleviate DM-induced myocardial damage by improving oxidative stress response (Li Y.-Y., 2022). Danhong injection has been reported to improve myocardial function in patients with DM through its anti-oxidative stress properties (Li D. L., 2022).",
        "Abnormal glucose metabolism is a well-known underlying cause of DM. The metabolic abnormalities that lead to DM include reduced glycogen synthesis and increased glycogen breakdown. Sangguadrink directly lower blood sugar levels by promoting liver glycogen synthesis (Cai et al., 2018). There exists a close relationship between glucose and lipid metabolism. When adipose tissue absorbs glucose, fat synthesis diminishes. Simultaneously, the mobilization and decomposition of stored fat are accelerated, resulting in a heightened level of free fatty acids and triglycerides in the bloodstream. Elevated levels of fatty acids can inhibit the synthesis of liver glycogen, promoting the production of more glucose and further aggravating hyperglycemic symptoms. Moreover, high concentrations of free fatty acids and triglycerides in the bloodstream increase the susceptibility of the myocardium to ischemic damage, thus inducing or aggravating DACC (Park, 2021). Lipid metabolism disorders result in fat accumulation in the liver, muscles, and blood vessel walls, affecting the normal role of insulin and resulting in IR, which is more likely to induce or aggravate hyperglycemia (Yan B. F. et al., 2023). Therefore, a research team found that Buyang Huanwu decoction can reduce the symptoms of T2DM in mice on a high-fat diet by improving lipid metabolism (Liu M. et al., 2022). Similar to the results of “maccog,” a kind of TCM tea, can improve the glucolipid metabolism and improve the symptoms of T2DM (Hu et al., 2023). In addition, HuoxueJiangtang decoction could enhance the function of islet β-cells by improving glucose and lipid metabolism (Huang Q. et al., 2022). Danhong injection, a certified Chinese medical product made from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge and Carthamus tinctorius L., is prescribed to patients with coronary heart disease in China and can improve cardiac function and control angina attacks by improving glucolipid metabolism (Li D. L., 2022). The Tianhuang formula can improve the mitochondrial function of adipocytes by regulating glycolipid metabolism and alleviating diabetes symptoms (Luo et al., 2023).",
        "The development and progression of DACC involve multiple genes and signaling pathways (Graczyk et al., 2024; Wang H. et al., 2024). Jinlid granules may mitigate DACC by modulating signal transduction or the TP53 pathway (Fang et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024). Tianhuang formula improves glycolipid metabolism in diabetic mice through the AMPK/MICU1 pathway (Luo et al., 2023). Si wei jiang huang tang san promotes glucose consumption by activating the ERK signaling pathway and inhibiting HIF-1α, so as to alleviate the symptoms of T1DM (Xu et al., 2024). Furthermore, Simiao Wan improved glucose tolerance, serum insulin, high density lipid cholesterol, hepatocyte morphology, and liver glycogen synthesis in T2DM mice by regulating the insulin receptor substrate-1/AKT2/FOXO1/glucose transported type (GLUT) 2 pathway (Xia et al., 2022).",
        "Endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) refers to the process by which endothelial cells lose their original characteristics and transform into mesenchymal cells (myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells) under the action of various stimulus factors. This transformation results in significant changes in their polarity, morphology, and function of endothelial cells. In the context of diabetes, vascular endothelial cells promote fibrosis after EndMT treatment, subsequently becoming more permeable to promote white blood cell and lipid accumulation in the arterial intima, resulting in plaque formation (You et al., 2022). Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi capsules have been shown to inhibit EndMT and prevent or reduce cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes (Wang L. et al., 2022).",
        "In addition, several other TCM prescriptions, such as Cortex mori-polygonatum odoratum tablets, Liuwei Dihuang Pills (Tang), and Banxiaxiexin Decoction, are used to prevent or treat DACC; however, the specific mechanism of this treatment remains unclear (Chen, 2022; Zhang F. et al., 2024; Zhu, 2024). Therefore, elucidating the specific mechanisms of action is essential for future studies.",
        "TCM botanical drugs are composed of plant extracts and are widely used in treatment, healthcare, skincare, and other fields because of their natural and nontoxic characteristics. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that many botanical TCM drugs and their extracts play crucial roles in combatting DACC (Prasopthum et al., 2022; Zhang L. et al., 2024; Zhou G. et al., 2023). TCM botanical drugs extracts from different solvents can prevent and treat DACC via multiple mechanisms (Table 4). These mechanisms mainly include reducing inflammation and regulating the immune system; properly regulating the intestinal flora; inhibiting the apoptosis or death of islet and cardiovascular cells, thereby enhancing their functions; affecting cellular stress, including endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) and oxidative stress; and regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, thereby reducing IR.",

        "Studies have found that propolis alcohol extract and Propolis water extracts can alleviate IR by reducing inflammation and regulating glucose metabolism, thereby alleviating DM symptoms (Guan et al., 2023). Inflammation also plays an important role in DACC (Spinetti et al., 2023). Citrus reticulata Blanco and Lycium Chinense Mill. alcohol extracts can inhibit vascular endothelial and myocardial cell inflammation, thus preventing or easing DACC (Wang Y. et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2022a).",
        "Gut flora also plays an important role in DACC (Alka et al., 2022). Pueraria montana (Lour.) Merr. aqueous extract and Sanghuangporus vaninii (Ljub.) L.W. Zhou and Y.C. Dai, Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge (AAE) alcohol extract, Phellinus baumii Pilát water and alcohol extract, and Dendrobium officinale Kimura and Migo extract, Pueraria montana (Lour.) Merr. water extracts can improve IR and blood sugar levels by regulating intestinal flora (Chen, 2022; Huang Z. R. et al., 2022; Li J. et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021; Yan D. et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2024).",
        "Cell death usually occurs in various forms, such as apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and other forms discovered so far. The death of islets and cardiovascular cells is one of the major contributing factors to DACC. In recent years, TCM botanical drugs have gained popularity as treatment for DACC. The alcohol extract of Lycium chinense Mill. was used to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats (Wen et al., 2022a). The results showed that inhibiting the apoptosis of heart cells is one of the main mechanisms for improving diabetic cardiomyopathy. Cassia obtusifolia L. is commonly used in clinical medicine to treat eye diseases, constipation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and DM. Studies have found that the use of Cassia tora L. seeds in the treatment of DM is mainly related to the inhibition of islet cell apoptosis (Bai et al., 2020). Ferroptosis, a new type of programmed cell death that is iron-dependent and differs from apoptosis, cell necrosis, and autophagy, was first proposed by Dr. Brent R. Stockwell of Columbia University in 2012 (Zeng et al., 2023). Morus alba L. leaves, an herb with high medicinal and economic value, possesses an aqueous extract capable of inhibiting ferroptosis in islet cells (Shi et al., 2023).",
        "The ER plays an important role in protein folding and is highly sensitive to changes in cellular homeostasis. Changes in the environment in which proteins fold can lead to the aggregation of unfolded or misfolded proteins and affect normal cell function (Chen and Zhang, 2023). When the ER is stressed, the unfolded protein response alleviates protein misfolding and restores cell homeostasis through a series of adaptive responses or induces apoptosis if homeostasis cannot be reshaped (Wiseman et al., 2022). ROS production has been confirmed to be closely related to ER stress and the unfolded protein response (Zeeshan et al., 2016). Although ROS are toxic, they can also mediate physiological processes as messenger molecules. The cytoplasm and various organelles, including the ER and mitochondria, produce ROS (Liu X. et al., 2022). Changes in the redox state of the ER can cause ER stress, which in turn induces ROS in the ER and mitochondria. Sustained oxidative and ER stress initiate apoptosis (Sahu et al., 2023). Lycium chinense Mill. attenuated cardiac oxidative stress and protected the myocardium (Wen et al., 2022a). Cynara scolymus L. improves IR in HepG2 cells by inhibiting ER stress (Deng et al., 2023). Astragalus membranaceus Fisch. ex Bunge and Trichosanthes L. aqueous extracts improve DACC through their anti-oxidant effects (Ma et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2022).",
        "Several botanical TCM drugs do not depend on a single mechanism of action to exert their effects. For example, Propolis ethanol extracts and Phellinus baumii Pilát have been shown to reduce IR by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism (Spinetti et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023). Different extraction solvents may exhibit different mechanisms of action. In addition to the antioxidant activity of the alcohol extract, Trichosanthes L. water extract improved the symptoms of type 1 diabetic rats by improving the liver glycogen content (Zhang et al., 2022). Garcinia cambogia Desr. aqueous extracts alleviate diabetes symptoms by improving lipid metabolism (Dong et al., 2023). Water extract of Siraitia grosvenorii (Swingle) C. Jeffrey ex A. M. Lu andand Zhi Y. Zhang promotes Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion, reduces insulin secretion, and has a hypoglycemic function. Hippophae rhamnoides L. is a plant that shares medicinal and dietary roles, has an alcohol extract that inhibits glucose absorption in the small intestine (Zhang et al., 2020). Glucidum lucidum (Leyss. ex Fr.) Karst. a type of fungus that reduces IR by increasing glucose consumption and intracellular triglyceride content in fat cells (Tan et al., 2022). Hypoglycemic effects of Pueraria montana (Lour.) Merr. and Hippophae rhamnoides L. are associated with reduced IR (Liu et al., 2024; Yan C.-Y. et al., 2023).",
        "Natural pharmaceutical chemicals consist of both inorganic and organic components. In TCM, the content of inorganic components such as minerals and metals, is relatively low compared with organic components Alkaloids, saponins, polysaccharides, flavonoids, phenanthrene quinones, phenols, and terpenoids are important organic components. Notably, compounds belonging to the same class can exhibit different mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action of these organic compounds in DACC include: 1) reducing inflammation and regulating immunity; 2) regulating intestinal mass; 3) inhibiting apoptosis or death of islet cells or cardiovascular cells; 4) affecting cellular stress (ER and oxidative stress); 5) regulating glycolipid metabolism and alleviating IR; 6) other mechanisms (affecting cell microenvironment, ion channels, and activation of autophagy) (Table 5).",

        "Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid found in plants such as Coptis Salisb. and Phellodendron Rupr. Clinically, its hydrochloride form, known as berberine hydrochloride, is widely used to treat intestinal infections. With the deepening of pharmacological research, berberine hydrochloride has been reported to have numerous pharmacological effects, including anticancer, antitumor, bactericidal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, and lipid-lowering properties (Song et al., 2020). Early studies have demonstrated that berberine not only shows potential in hypoglycemic studies in animals and humans but also has considerable therapeutic effects in DACC (Coppinger et al., 2024). In addition, studies have shown that berberine can improve diabetic complications without causing substantial side effects (Chang et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2021). Compared with other first-line drugs and treatments, berberine is relatively inexpensive and suitable for long-term management of T2DM and related complications. Numerous studies have shown that berberine can considerably reduce blood sugar in rats by regulating the intestinal flora, alleviating intestinal inflammation, and increasing the absorption and utilization of glucose in the small intestine (Nematollahi et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2020). Furthermore, berberine can improve cardiometabolic status and myocardial inflammation, as well as improve blood sugar levels and protect the myocardium of diabetic patients (Nematollahi et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2020).",
        "Matrine, an alkaloid extracted from the dried roots, plants, and fruits of Sophora flavescens Aiton, has a wide range of physiological activities, including antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-tumor, anti-fibrosis, and protective effects on multiple organs and tissues (Lin et al., 2022). As one of the effective active compounds, matrine increases insulin sensitivity, lowers blood sugar levels, and ameliorates DACC. IR can lead to impaired endothelial function, including barrier dysfunction, impaired nitric oxide (NO) activity, excessive production of ROS, oxidative stress, and inflammatory dysregulation. NO acts through eNOS-regulated biosynthesis, and is a potent vasodilator and an important vascular endothelial protective factor. The PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway is widely present in vascular endothelial cells and plays an important role in the regulation of vasodilation and contraction (Wen et al., 2022b). Activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway enhances eNOS expression and plays a regulatory role in eNOS. Astragaloside IV activates the PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway and promotes eNOS expression to improve myocardial function in diabetic rats (Wu S. et al., 2023). Astragaloside IV can also enhance pancreatic beta cell dysfunction induced by uric acid through the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, anti-apoptotic effects, and activation of autophagy (Jiang Z. et al., 2022). Astragaloside IV can regulate intestinal flora, remove ROS free radicals, and reverse abnormal levels of blood lipids, blood sugar, IR, and antioxidant stress in Kunming mice (Gong P. et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). Anemoside B4, a natural saponin extracted from Pulsatilla chinensis of the goldenseal family, has good efficacy as anti-tumor, anti-inflammation, and neuroprotective effects (Li Y. F. J. et al., 2020). Recent studies have found that Anemoside B4 also plays a role in lowering blood glucose levels by promoting glucose uptake by muscle cells, facilitating the transport and utilization of grape sleeves, enhancing GLUT4 expression, and regulating various mechanisms of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Gong, 2023a; Gong, 2023b; Gong et al., 2023). These studies provided data for the prevention and treatment of DM and its associated cardiovascular complications.",
        "Polysaccharides from botanical drugs in TCM are complex sugars with complex molecular structures that are extracted from botanical drugs. An increasing number of studies have shown that polysaccharides have considerable efficacy in treating cardiovascular complications in diabetes (Zhang et al., 2019). Dendrobium offiHerbalcinale Kimura and Migo polysaccharides may regulate glycogen synthesis and glucose metabolism through the insulin/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, improve sugar metabolic disorder in mice with T2DM, and exert hypoglycemic activity (Liu, 2019). The Lycium Chinense Mill. polysaccharide was derived from the medicine-edible plant Lycium Chinense Mill. LBP also reduces blood sugar levels and improves insulin sensitivity in diabetic mice by regulating gut flora (Ma et al., 2022). The purified RG polysaccharide was extracted from Rehmannia Libosch. ex Fisch. and C.A.Mey. can also lower blood sugar levels by affecting glucose metabolism (Zhou et al., 2015). Coix lacryma L., a TCM, has many health benefits, and Coix lacryma L. polysaccharides are its main active compounds. In a mouse model of DM, Coix lacryma L. polysaccharides were found to reduce blood sugar levels by improving the intestinal flora (Xia et al., 2021). Polysaccharides from Polygonatum sibiricum Redouté have a substantial hypoglycemic effect in T2DM (Chen et al., 2023). Plant polysaccharides not only have significant efficacy in DM but also show good prospects for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Astragalus L. inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis in diabetic mice by improving ER stress, providing strong evidence for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy (Sun et al., 2019).",
        "Flavonoids are a class of natural compounds characterized by a 2-phenylchromogen (flavone) structure. They can be classified into various structural types depending on the degree of oxidation of the central carbon, ring formation, and the junction site of the B ring. These structural types include flavones, isoflavones, flavonols, dihydroflavones, dihydroflavonols, dihydroisoflavones, chalcones, aurones, flavanes, anthocyanidins, anthocyanidins, and biflavones. Flavonoids are widely distributed in nature, and exhibit various biological activities. Many studies have shown that they have high application value in DM and cardiovascular diseases (Hou et al., 2013; Jin and Arroo, 2023).",
        "Mangiferin, a compound derived from mangoes, possesses various pharmacological and nutritional properties. Upregulation of MMP-2 and downregulation of MMP-9 reduce myocardial collagen accumulation, protein expression of IRE1, ASK1, and JNK in cardiomyocytes, and ER stress in cardiomyocytes, thus inhibiting the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy (Hou et al., 2013; Jin and Arroo, 2023). Puerarin, a derivative extracted from TCM, plays an active anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, anti-myocardial hypertrophy, and anti-myocardial fibrosis and is closely related to programmed cell death. Studies have shown that puerarin can improve or prevent cardiomyopathy in diabetic rats by inhibiting ROS production, pyroptosis, and the inflammation of cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells (Bai et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2024). Luteolins are a class of flavonoids widely found in TCM botanical drugs and are natural antioxidants. Chen et al. found that luteolin reduced oxidative stress and myocardial tissue inflammation, thereby improving myocardial function in rats with diabetic cardiomyopathy (Chen, 2023). Flavonoid components of Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb (Rosaceae) alleviates oxidative stress injury through the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK)/PI3K/Akt pathway, reduces the expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines while improving glucose metabolism, and alleviating fatty IR (Guo et al., 2023). Naringin is derived from the Rutaceae plant, Citrus maxima (Burm.) Merr. fruit and is a natural flavonoid compound. Grapefruit is a popular fruit worldwide (Li Y. F. J. et al., 2020). However, it is also a TCM that can serve as both medicine and food in China and has a variety of biological activities, including promoting digestion, anti-inflammatory effects, and relieving hangovers. The total flavonoids in Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack leaves relieve inflammation mediated by free-radical lipid peroxidation, strengthen the pancreatic beta cell secretion index, improve lipid metabolism disorders, and diabetic cardiomyopathy (Sun, 2020).",
        "Phenanthraquinone is a quinone containing compound. Several studies have indicated that tanshinone IIA is the most fat-soluble component of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, which can improve the symptoms of diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis mediated by ER stress (Tao et al., 2019; Wu S. et al., 2023). Tanshinone I is a natural phenanthrene quinone extracted from Salviorrhiza that can regulate glycogen metabolism and improve blood sugar levels and IR in T2DM rats (Wei et al., 2017).",
        "Phenolic compounds are a diverse group of natural compounds commonly found in TCM. Curcumin is a natural polyphenolic compound extracted from ginger plants, which imparts a unique color and flavor to food. In addition, curcumin has significant medicinal value as it can improve human immunity, accelerate body metabolism, and have anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, lipid-lowering, gallbladder, and other biological activities. It has been applied in food, medicine, animal production, and other fields. Studies have shown that curcumin can reduce lipid levels, enhance anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities, activate IR signaling pathways, considerably prevent blood sugar rise in mice, reduce IR, and improve insulin sensitivity (Chen, 2022). Furthermore, curcumin can reduce ferroptosis and associated myocardial damage in diabetic mice via the NRF2-glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway (Wei Z. et al., 2022). Curcumin analogs can also inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway, myocardial inflammation, and improve diabetic cardiomyopathy (Wang M. et al., 2022). Moreover, curcumin inhibits the glycosylation of myocardial proteins in mice induced by a high-fructose diet (Leon-Garcia et al., 2022), improves the cardiomyopathy of diabetic rats induced by STZ combined with a high-fat and high-sugar diet, and activates the silencing information regulator 1(Sirt1)-fork head transcription factor (FoxO1) and PI3K-AKT pathways, alleviating myocardial oxidative stress and inhibiting apoptosis (Ren et al., 2020). C66, a derivative mentioned in the literature, has been shown to ameliorate obesity-related cardiomyopathy induced by a high-fat diet and palmitic acid-stimulated cardiomyocyte injury in H9c2 rats by inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway (Ye et al., 2021). The rose is the dried bud of the Rosaceae family, which has high ornamental, edible, and medicinal value. Rosa rugosa Thunb. polyphenol extract, a polyphenol-rich rose extract, inhibits the activity of α-glucosidase, an enzyme that breaks down complex carbohydrates into absorbable monosaccharides in the small intestine, improving glycogen metabolism and regulating the blood glucose of T2DM rats (Liu et al., 2017). Resveratrol attenuates diabetic cardiac microvascular injury through antioxidative stress (Cai, 2024).",
        "Terpenoids represent the largest group of natural compounds. Volatile oils, resins, rubber, and carotenes are terpenoids, most of which have various physiological activities. Diterpenoids extracted from rock sugar grass can protect islets and alleviate IR (Sun et al., 2020). Euscaphic acid, Tormentic acid, Corosolic acid, Maslinic acid, Oleanolic acid, and Ursolic acid belong to terpenoids and can inhibit alpha glycosidic enzyme activity in vitro and inhibit the absorption of glucose (Chen J. W. et al., 2020). These findings suggest that it may offer promising avenues for treating DM and its related cardiovascular complications.",
        "In addition, based on the principle that structure determines function, the derivatives of these compounds may be used for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and its cardiovascular complications. TPX, derived from the mangiferin derivative 1,3,6,7-tetraallylloxy ketone, can restore the insulin signaling pathway, increase liver glycogen synthesis, and protect against IR caused by glucose metabolism disorders in liver cells (Fan et al., 2023).",
        "The number of people diagnosed with DM is increasing (Collaborators, 2023). The risk of cardiovascular disease in people with DM is approximately 2.5 times that in people without DM, contributing to the impaired life expectancy of patients with DM (Bragg et al., 2017; Bragg et al., 2016). Although numerous standard biomedical drugs are currently being researched for the treatment of DM and related diseases. However, owing to the side effects and toxicity of these drugs (Table 2), it appears that the single use of standard biomedical treatment drugs is not the optimal plan for patients with chronic diseases who need to take them for a long time. As research into DACC advances, the preventive and therapeutic effects of TCM have been increasingly affirmed. TCM compound prescriptions, botanical drugs, and monomer components have been shown to have positive effects on DACC prevention and treatment. The pathogenesis of includes mainly multiple factors (such as intestinal flora disorders, inflammation, oxidative stress, ER stress, and metabolic disorders) induced by impaired islet function, insufficient insulin secretion, or a decreased ability to perceive glucose (Figure 1). Long-term high-sugar stimulation causes inflammation and damages the normal physiological functions of vascular endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. In addition, high sugar levels cause oxidative stress in the myocardium and cardiovascular cells, resulting in cardiovascular damage. Hyperglycemia stimulates the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and collagen synthesis, leading to fibrosis and hardening of the vascular wall, causing blood vessels to lose their elasticity, increasing vascular resistance and pressure, and inducing diabetic cardiovascular disease. Long-term high sugar consumption stimulates intestinal flora disorder, which can destroy the normal metabolism of the body, enhance the oxidative stress response in the body, and through the secretion of harmful bacterial endotoxins, shift to cardiovascular circulation and aggravate cardiovascular system inflammation. This review explores the relevant mechanisms of TCM compound prescriptions, TCM botanical drugs, and active compounds in the prevention and treatment of DACC in recent years. Also, it provides the necessary theoretical basis for the modern development of TCM. An increasing number of studies have suggested that the effect of integrated Chinese and standard biomedical treatments on the treatment of DM yields better outcomes than standard biomedical treatments alone (Gu et al., 2018; Ma K. et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2019). Studies have shown that Liuwei Dihuang Pill (decoction) combined with metformin for the treatment of T2DM may reduce the adverse effects of metformin (Zhao et al., 2019). Gu Yuming (Gu et al., 2018) reported that the common adverse events in the TCM group were gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea/vomiting, bloating, and diarrhea), nervous system symptoms, and hypoglycemia. However, no significant abnormalities in blood, liver, or kidney functions were observed in any of these studies. This may provide ideas for promoting combined treatments for DACC. Therefore, the use of TCM, either independently or in combination with standard biomedical therapies, represents a viable alternative for the prevention and treatment of DACC.",

        "TCM has demonstrated unique advantages in the prevention and treatment of DACC, offering novel therapeutic approaches through its multicomponent, multitarget mechanisms of action. However, the clinical application of TCM for the management of DACC poses substantial challenges. First, the complexity of TCM components and issues related to standardization remain major hurdles. Each TCM botanical drug is a complex mixture of natural compounds that often contain various chemical constituents such as alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and polysaccharides. For instance, ginseng alpha wood contains multiple ginsenosides as well as volatile oils, polysaccharides, and amino acids, which interact synergistically. In compound formulations, the chemical complexity is further amplified, making it difficult to precisely elucidate pharmacological mechanisms. This complexity poses a challenge for quality control and drug development. For instance, when studying the mechanisms of action of a TCM formulation for DM treatment, it is challenging to identify the specific components that exert hypoglycemic effects and how they interact. Standardization issues also hinder the clinical application of TCM. The quality of TCM botanic materials varies considerably due to differences in geographical origin, cultivation environment, harvesting season, and processing methods. For instance, Angelica sinensis from Min County, Gansu Province, China, differs in its active component content from those in other regions. Even within the same region, variations in the climate and other factors can lead to inconsistent quality. In addition, the lack of uniform and precise standards in TCM processing further complicates quality control, because different processing techniques can yield products with varying efficacies. In the process of TCM preparations, the absence of standard quality control systems results in substantial variability in the composition and efficacy of products from different manufacturers, which undermines the accuracy and effectiveness for clinical applications. Second, the safety and adverse effects of TCM cannot be overlooked. Although TCM is often perceived to be natural and safe, this is not always the case. Some TCM herbs contain toxic components such as aconitine in Aconitum species, which can cause severe poisoning if improperly processed or overdosed. Moreover, the adverse effects of TCM may be insidious and delayed, making prompt detection difficult. Hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were the most common adverse effects. For example, long-term use of certain compound formulations containing Astragalus L., Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, and Coptis Salisb. Is associated with liver injury. A case study reported that a patient with diabetes developed abnormal liver function 6 months after using a TCM formulation, which resolved after discontinuation (Pan et al., 2020). Similarly, herbs such as Polygonum multiflorum and Tripterygium wilfordii have been linked to hepatotoxicity, potentially causing irreversible liver damage (Song J. et al., 2023). Mechanistically, certain TCM components such as anthraquinones and alkaloids may induce oxidative stress or directly damage hepatocytes. Chronic use of herbs containing aristolochic acid, such as Aristolochia manshuriensis Kom. and Aristolochia fangchi Y. C. Wu ex L. D. Chow and S. M. Hwang has been associated with nephrotoxicity, potentially leading to chronic renal failure (Omer Mohamed et al., 2020). Aristolochic acid may induce apoptosis and fibrosis in renal tubular epithelial cells. In addition, the combination of TCM with standard biomedical treatments, owing to their complex composition, may lead to drug interactions and increase the risk of adverse effects. For instance, the concurrent use of hypoglycemic herbs, such as Ginseng Alpha Wood and Lycium barbarum Mill. With standard biomedical treatments, antidiabetic drugs may increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia (Ni et al., 2024). This may be attributed to active components such as ginsenosides, which enhance insulin sensitivity or promote glucose utilization. However, current research on TCM safety remains limited and lacks a comprehensive safety evaluation system, making it difficult for clinicians and patients to accurately assess and manage potential risks. Furthermore, most existing studies have been limited to animal experiments or small-scale clinical trials, with a lack of large-scale, high-quality, multicenter, randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms of TCM, conducting high-quality multicenter RCTs, and investigating the synergistic effects and potential risks of combining TCM with standard biomedical treatments to advance the modernization and global recognition of TCM. Modern scientific techniques, such as network pharmacology and metabolomics, should be employed to investigate the active components and multi-target mechanisms of TCM to provide safer and more effective therapeutic options for DACC.",
        "Despite the systematic review of TCM applications in DACC presented in this study, several limitations persist. Mechanistic studies addressing anti-inflammatory and gut microbiota regulation lack depth in molecular biology and cellular signaling pathways, making it difficult to precisely delineate the synergistic actions of complex components. Clinically, the scarcity of high-quality, large-sample, multicenter RCTs limits the reliability and generalizability of these findings. In addition, there is a notably deficiency in studies investigating the combined use of TCM with standard biomedical treatments, failing to provide adequate guidance for clinical practice. Otherwise, the methodological rigor of the studies incorporated in this review calls for careful and critical examination. In the realm of study design standardization, there seem to be several prevalent concerns. A significant number of studies have not adopted standardized approaches for estimating sample sizes. This lack of standardization can potentially lead to underpowered studies, which may in turn impact the general applicability of the findings, particularly when attempting to discern differences in treatment effects across various patient subgroups. Furthermore, the documentation of randomization protocols appears to be somewhat insufficient, and the setup of control groups could be optimized. When assessing the interventions of TCM in the context of DACC, the potential synergistic or antagonistic interactions between conventional therapies and TCM botanical drugs formulations have yet to be comprehensively evaluated. In addition, the over - reliance on subjective patient - reported outcomes raises some questions regarding data reliability. Since these outcomes are susceptible to recall bias and placebo effects, they might not provide the most robust basis for drawing firm conclusions. As for traditional pre - clinical models, there are certain aspects that could be improved. Rodent models exhibit species - specific variations in glucose homeostasis mechanisms and cardiovascular drug metabolism pathways, and traditional in - vitro islet cell models struggle to fully replicate the intricate paracrine signaling networks and three - dimensional niche architecture characteristic of the human pancreatic microenvironment. These gaps require further investigation.",
        "Future research on the use of TCM for the prevention and treatment of DACC is both challenging and promising. Modern separation technologies, such as chromatography-mass spectrometry, should be employed to isolate and identify active TCM components and elucidate their mechanisms of action to establish a solid theoretical foundation for clinical applications. However, large-scale, high-quality, multicenter RCTs are urgently required to validate the efficacy and safety of TCM. Exploring the synergistic effects and potential risks of combining TCM with standard biomedical treatments will enable the development of scientifically sound treatment protocols and offer patients better therapeutic options. Future research should adopt prospective designs and employ validated methods to ensure high - level effectiveness of the studies. Furthermore, leveraging modern scientific techniques, such as network pharmacology and metabolomics, will drive the modernization of TCM and enhance its global recognition and application. This will enable TCM to play a pivotal role in the global prevention and treatment of diabetes, thereby contributing substantially to this field.",
        "In summary, TCM has made remarkable progress in the prevention and treatment of DACC. With the continuous development of biomedicine, science, and technology, the mechanism of action of TCM in the treatment of DACC is expected to improve. More advanced modern bioscience technologies are expected to help researchers identify targets and apply TCM with multiple components, mechanisms, and targets for the prevention and treatment of DACC. In addition, research on the combination of TCM and standard biomedical treatments in the treatment of DACC will be continuously deepened, and basic research and clinical trials of TCM will also achieve a comprehensive transformation. New related technologies may be the primary tool for overcoming the problems associated with the prevention and treatment of various diseases, further promoting the application of TCM in clinical settings.",

    "title": "SGLT2 inhibitors. epidemic proportions over the last few decades worldwide. Although several treatment options are available, only half of the global diabetic population achieves the recommended or individualized glycemic targets. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of antidiabetic agents with a novel insulin-independent action. SGLT2 is a transporter found in the proximal renal tubules, responsible for the reabsorption of most of the glucose filtered by the kidney. Inhibition of SGLT2 lowers the blood glucose level by promoting the urinary excretion of excess glucose. Due to their insulin-independent action, SGLT2 inhibitors can be used with any degree of beta-cell dysfunction or insulin resistance, related to a very low risk of hypoglycemia. In addition to improving glycemic control, SGLT2 inhibitors have been associated with a reduction in weight and blood pressure when used as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors is usually well tolerated; however, they have been associated with an increased incidence of urinary tract and genital infections, although these infections are usually mild and easy to treat. SGLT2 inhibitors are a promising new option in the armamentarium of drugs for patients with T2DM. College at Thomas Jefferson University, 211 South Ninth Street, Ste 600, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.

        "In recent years, tremendous interest has emerged in ketone metabolism due to numerous discoveries showing that ketone bodies not only serve as essential fuel sources but also act as signaling molecules, influencing cellular metabolism, inflammation, cell communication, and bioenergetics across nearly every organ [1]. Increasing evidence suggests that ketones may become a promising therapeutic target for a wide range of diseases, including cancer, obesity, aging, neurodegeneration, inflammatory disorders, diabetes, and heart failure [2,3,4]. While ketone bodies have historically been viewed with fear by clinicians, particularly due to their association with diabetic ketoacidosis and severe illness, the perception of these molecules has evolved significantly. Initially seen as metabolic byproducts, it became clear that ketones are crucial alternative energy substrates, particularly for the brain during periods of starvation or carbohydrate deprivation. Furthermore, the role of ketones has expanded beyond energy provision to include metabolic signaling, with emerging research highlighting their involvement in various tissues, including immune cells in the visceral adipose tissue [5] and intestinal cells [6].",
        "The term “ketone bodies” usually implies three main products of ketogenesis: β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and acetone. Of note, amino acids like lysine and leucine are regarded as strictly ketogenic amino acids, providing carbon units for ketone bodies synthesis in the liver [7,8,9]. BHB is the most abundant ketone body and its levels in circulation change much faster in response to metabolic changes compared to AcAc or acetone [1,10].",
        "Recent data from in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro experiments, as well as clinical trials, suggest that ketones are attractive molecules that may act synergistically with pharmacotherapy and can lead to new strategies to preserve cardiac and beta cell function.",
        "Alterations in cardiac energy metabolism play a central role in the mechanism of heart failure (HF) [11]. In the heart, ketone bodies may play a dual role, providing energy and signaling functions in both healthy and diseased states [12,13]. Basic research strongly conjectures that BHB supports heart function in disease [12,13].",
        "Real-world data show that higher levels of BHB are associated with a higher risk of HF. In the elderly population (70–82 years) from the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) cohort study, increased serum levels of BHB were a predictive marker of HF [14]. The Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease (PREVEND) study enrolled 8592 male and female residents in the city of Groningen (the Netherlands), between the ages of 27 and 75 years, with albuminuria [15]. Analysis of this population revealed sex differences in BHB’s association with HF incidence [16]. During the 8.2-year follow-up period, BHB was a strong predictor of HF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in women, but not in men, with hazard ratios of 2.12 and 4.75 in women against 1.17 and 1.09 in men (for HF and HFrEF, respectively). Higher levels of BHB were predictive for HF independently from the body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, myocardial infarction, dyslipidemia, kidney function, smoking, and alcohol consumption. However, when adjusted for a history of atrial fibrillation, heart rate, and NT-proBN levels, the effect of BHB became non-significant [16]. In another small study, levels of BHB were found to be higher in HF patients compared to healthy counterparts [17]",
        "Studies in HF populations also confirmed a positive correlation between circulating BHB and negative outcomes. In a prospective, single-center, observational study with a total of 152 hospitalized patients with acute HF, BHB predicted 3-month mortality. The hazard ratio was 2.15 even after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, T2D, kidney function, arterial pressure, LDL-cholesterol, and NT-proBNP [18]. Post-analysis of the LIVE trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01472640), which evaluated the effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 analog liraglutide on HF in T2D patients [19], found reduced 9-year mortality in patients with low plasma BHB (<0.059 mM) [20]. BHB predicted both the development of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in AC patients [21]. In a larger study that enrolled 867 HFrEF patients, high BHB predicted a higher incidence of composite events (including death, urgent transplantation, or left ventricular assistance device implantation) during an 8-year observation period [22]. Interestingly, high levels of BHB were also associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes and higher levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) [20,22]. Moreover, high levels of FFAs predicted high BHB levels in a multi-variable analysis [20]. Composite events were more frequent in patients with high FFAs and low BHB than in those with low FFAs and high BHB [22]. These data strongly suggest the absence of a causative connection between elevated BHB and HF.",
        "Data from myocardial infarction (MI) populations confirms the idea that elevated BHB is not detrimental to the heart. In a GIPS-III trial (NCT01217307), blood samples were obtained from 360 non-diabetic patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as 24 h and 4 months after [23]. BHB levels before PCI were significantly higher than 24 h after, and 24 h levels were higher than at the 4-month time point. Moreover, 24 h levels of BHB positively correlated with myocardial infarct size and negatively with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [24]. A smaller study in 59 STEMI patients confirmed a decrease in BHB levels after PCI [25]. These data suggest that an increase in BHB is a consequence of cardiac injury and/or dysfunction, rather than their mediator. Moreover, recent data suggest that increased production of BHB might represent a protective mechanism. For instance, in the EMMY trial (NCT03087773) cohort (476 acute MI patients), high baseline levels of BHB at admission were associated with worse cardiac function at the end of the 26-week follow-up period [26]. However, in the same cohort, an increase in BHB levels during the observational period was associated with an improvement in cardiac parameters [26].",
        "Plausibly, ketonemia in HF and MI patients results from increased ketogenesis in the heart. Early studies demonstrated that in HF patients, a fasting period elicits higher ketonemia than in healthy participants [27]. In a recent comprehensive study, Jiang-Ping Song, Liang Chen, and co-authors demonstrated that, at least in AC, ketonemia is a result of cardiac BHB production [21]. They performed proteomic and metabolomic analyses of heart explants from AC patients and healthy volunteers and discovered that the expression of enzymes involved in BHB synthesis was increased in AC samples. Expression of BHB transporters mediating both uptake and efflux of the compound was also upregulated. It was accompanied by higher plasma levels of BHB in AC patients compared to healthy volunteers [21]. However, definitive results came from 13 AC patients who underwent heart transplantation. In all 13 patients, circulating BHB was drastically decreased after transplantation compared to pre-surgery levels. At the same time, levels of NEFAs (non-esterified fatty acids), serving as a precursor for ketone bodies, remained unchanged in these patients, suggesting that decreased BHB production was not the result of limited substrate supply [21].",
        "Importantly, in all the above-mentioned studies, the increase in serum concentration of BHB in a predominant number of patients remained in the normal range (0.1–0.3 mM), with only a few participants exceeding 0.5 mM. These findings rule out the possibility of ketoacidosis being the mediator of those effects and suggests that BHB acts as a signaling metabolite fine-tuning cardiac function.",
        "Increased levels of BHB also predict a higher incidence of diabetes [28]. The research group of A.V. Ahola-Olli and P. Würtz analyzed a large Finish cohort of 11,896 individuals pooled from four different studies (namely YFS, FINRISK-1997, DILGOM, and NFBC). Participants were younger than 45 years old and diabetes-free. Increased plasma levels of BHB were associated with a higher risk of T2D development during 10 years of follow-up [29]. Of note, the analysis of a Dutch cohort of 3307 participants in the PREVEND study confirmed these results. Interestingly, BHB was associated with higher risk of T2D development independently from age, sex, BMI, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, or renal function. Moreover, T2D incidence increased in a dose-dependent manner when individuals were stratified according to BHB concentration [30]. The METSIM (Metabolic Syndrome in Men) study including 4335 healthy or newly diagnosed diabetic participants found higher BHB levels in patients with high fasting glucose levels [31]. Another pooled study evaluated 1623 clinically healthy individuals aged 30–60 years old from The Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular Disease Study (RISC Study) and The Diabetes Mellitus and Vascular Health Initiative (DMVhi) screening study. In this study, investigators found a statistically significant positive correlation between circulating BHB levels and impaired glucose tolerance [32]. Furthermore, BHB also predicted the development of T2D in obese patients [33].",
        "A study of a small cohort of pregnant women identified plasma metabolites that were able to discriminate healthy pregnant women from those with gestational diabetes. BHB was the most highly upregulated metabolite in the gestational diabetes group both in the second and third trimesters [34]. Moreover, higher levels of BHB in the second trimester and 3 months postpartum predicted the development of T2D during the 2 years of follow-up [34]. Another smaller study demonstrated that BHB levels were able to predict the development of gestational diabetes in obese women [31].",
        "However, like in HF, increased BHB levels are most likely to be a consequence of T2D or even an adaptive response. Despite BHB being positively correlated in two different studies with the risk of T2D development or the presence of hyperglycemia, in the same cohorts, BHB levels correlated positively with better insulin sensitivity [29,35]. More conclusive evidence comes from the study of 369 newly diagnosed drug-naïve T2D patients. In this study, high levels of BHB were associated with better response to the treatment at 3 and 6 months of follow-up [36]. These results are in contradiction with a study of patients receiving metabolic surgery. Higher circulating BHB levels were a negative predictor of response during 3 months of follow-up [37]. Moreover, in this study, plasma BHB levels demonstrated a strong negative correlation with HbAc1 [37]. However, this discrepancy may be explained by the fact that individuals in the non-responder group had a longer duration of diabetes.",
        "Different animal models of HF provide compelling evidence of the therapeutic potential of BHB.",
        "In a two-hit (high-fat diet (HFD) + L-NAME) rat model of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), recapitulating the cardiac dysfunction in diabetes, both circulating and myocardial levels of BHB gradually decreased during the disease course. Moreover, expression of a key enzyme for BHB metabolism—D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1)—was also lower in the heart of HFpEF rats [38]. A Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 inhibitor (iSGLT2), Dapagliflozin (DAPA), restored BHB levels and mitigated diastolic dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, and hypertrophy. These effects were accompanied by restoration of the normal level of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins abundancy [38]. Interestingly, DAPA did not restore BDH1 levels, but in contrast, further decreased it. This may suggest that restoration of BHB levels was due to decreased utilization of BHB, and hence BHB protected the heart not as an energic substrate but as a signaling molecule [1,38]. However, this study did not employ pharmacological or genetic inhibitory approaches to tell correlative and causative effects apart. Effects of HF and DAPA on BHB utilizations remain debatable, as in the transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model higher BHB oxidation was detected in diseased hearts, and DAPA further increased it [39]. Despite being a glucose-lowering drug, DAPA did not decrease glucose utilization in the heart, additionally supporting the hypothesis that the promotion of ketosis is the primary mechanism of iSGLT2’s cardioprotection [39]. And indeed, in a more severe model of HFpEF combining aging, HFD, and desoxycorticosterone pivalate, BHB supplementation in the form of ketone ester and the iSGLT2 Empagliflozin (EMPA) demonstrated the comparable protective effect [40]. Furthermore, in a two-hit model of HFpEF, BHB treatment alone was able to restore normal diastolic function [41].",
        "Recently, our group demonstrated that in a murine model of post-ischemic HF a chow supplemented with BHB mitigated myocardial lesions and cardiac dysfunction [42]. BHB also preserved mitochondrial mass and function. The effect of BHB on mitochondria was found to be underlined by the epigenetic control of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) expression. Importantly, these BHB-controlled epigenetic changes were detected both in the murine model of HF and human heart samples from patients with HF [42]. In contrast to BHB supplementation, the ketogenic diet did not exert protective action in a similar model of HF [43] and impaired cardiac energetic flexibility and efficiency reducing glucose oxidation, even under insulin injection [43]; it also failed to improve heart function in another model combining TAC and myocardial infarction [44]. However, in the same model, cardiomyocyte-specific KO of BDH1 exacerbated HF, demonstrating the instrumental role of BHB utilization under stress conditions [44]. Intriguingly, bioenergetic effects of BHB were similar to those of a ketogenic diet: reduced glucose utilization and higher dependence on fatty acid utilization. However, BHB infusion retarded the progression of tachycardia-induced HF, again highlighting the non-energetic effects of BHB [44].",
        "BHB was demonstrated to elicit immediate protection in the model of cardiac ischemia—reperfusion (I/R) injury. Single intraperitoneal injection of BHB immediately after 45 min ischemia in one study or continuous releases of BHB from an osmotic pump after 30 min ischemia reduced myocardial infarction and improved ejection fraction, as measured after 24 h of reperfusion [25,45]. The protective effect of BHB vanished in Atg7-KO mice, highlighting the pivotal role of autophagy in BHB-mediated cardioprotection. And indeed, the authors demonstrated an increase in autophagosome flux after BHB administration [25,45]. In line with Gambardella’s findings, BHB rescued a decrease in mitochondrial mass after I/R [25]. BHB also mitigated cardiac and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pig model of heart transplantation [46]. In line with the HF results, mice with MI that were fed a ketogenic diet showed worsened cardiac dysfunction compared to MI mice on a control chow diet [47].",
        "BHB also exhibited a therapeutic potential in other models of cardiovascular pathologies. In a recent study, Lan and colleagues demonstrated that the supplementation with 1,3-butanediol (1,3-B), a precursor of BHB, helped reduce aortic calcification in rats with chronic kidney disease and in mice treated with excessive vitamin D3. Moreover, their research revealed that BHB prevents vascular calcification by influencing the NF-KB signaling pathway through HDAC9 modulation [48]. Similarly, in another study, Chakraborty et al. showed that 1,3-B supplementation increased BHB levels and offered protection to mice against hypertension and kidney inflammation. However, they also found that a high-salt diet led to a reduction in BHB levels [49]. In streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus rats, the ketogenic diet improved cardiac function and decreased myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis as compared to the control mice that were fed a normal diet [50]. The latest results may sound contradictory to the absence of the protective effect of the ketogenic diet in models of HF. However, in STZ-model of diabetes, pancreatic beta-cells are destroyed and insulin production vanishes. Hence, the protective effect of the ketogenic diet might be attributed to either BHB production or to reduced carbohydrate intake.",
        "Stimulation of ketogenesis to harness potential BHB cardio protection is an objectionable approach due to the risk of ketoacidosis. Finding relatively safe physiological ways to upregulate intrinsic BHB production is crucial, as fasting or ketogenic diets have many limitations related to compliance and specific dietary requirements in some of the pathologies accompanying HF. This makes a case for utilizing exogenous BHB. The ability of BHB to modulate cardiac function has been demonstrated in healthy young volunteers. Orally delivered ketone ester (releasing BHB in the organism) increased cardiac performance and decreased systemic vascular resistance [51,52]. Intravenous (i.v.) administration of BHB increased heart rate and myocardial blood flow [53].",
        "In a small, acute, but well-designed study, exogenous BHB exerted beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients with HFrEF [54]. The study enrolled 24 patients with LVEF ≤40% and 10 age-matched healthy volunteers. Participants received three different doses of BHB (one supraphysiological and two physiological) via i.v. infusion, and various cardiac function parameters were measured 3 h later. In the treatment arm (all doses), cardiac output, stroke volume, LVEF, heart rate, and oxygen consumption were higher compared to placebo. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and mean pulmonary pressure were lower. In age-matched healthy participants, BHB exerted similar effects. Dynamic measurement of blood levels of BHB and cardiac output demonstrated a strong positive correlation between these parameters in time. BHB infusion increased oxygen consumption and cardiac work proportionally, leaving myocardial external energy efficiency unaltered [54]. This means that coupling between myocardial energy generation and cardiac work was not compromised, despite decreased vascular resistance. This is important for safety considerations. Reduced myocardial external energy efficiency is a powerful clinical predictor for cardiac death in patients with HF [55].",
        "In an elegant study published in 2023, Nigopan Gopalasingam and co-authors from Aarhus University Hospital aimed to delineate the signaling mechanism of BHB [56]. The biological activity of BHB is mediated through different mechanisms, including direct inhibition of histone deacetylase, β-hydroxybutyrylation of proteins, facilitation of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, and stimulation of two plasmalemma receptors—Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2) and Free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3 or GPR41) [1]. The Gopalasingam group focused on HCA2. This G-protein-coupled receptor has two ligands: niacin and BHB [57,58]. In animal studies, stimulation of HCA2 by BHB exerted two effects important for cardiovascular health. First, it downregulated lipolysis in adipocytes, thus reducing their levels in circulation [58]. Moreover, the second HCA2 ligand, niacin, is one of the most effective lipid-modifying drugs [59]. The second effect of HCA2 activation is the attenuation of the L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL) [60]. ICaL plays a critical role in cardiomyocyte contraction. However, its activity is increased in hypertrophic and failing hearts and plausibly facilitates arrhythmogenicity [61]. Additionally, stimulation of HCA2 with niacin triggers the production of vasoactive prostanoids, modifying the course of congestive HF [62,63,64]. Moreover, the BHB effect on the heart could be mediated in an HCA2-independent manner. To distinguish between these signaling mechanisms, researchers compared the effects of BHB and niacin in the presence or absence of aspirin, which blocks prostanoid synthesis [56]. The study was conducted on 28 patients with HHrEF. All patients were monitored with pulmonary artery catheter measurements, echocardiography, and blood samples at baseline and hourly for a 6 h period after drug injection. BHB increased cardiac output and diminished FFA levels both in the presence and absence of aspirin, meaning that BHB effects are independent of prostaglandin/prostacyclin synthesis [56]. Indeed, BHB treatment did not affect the concentration of prostaglandin D2. Interestingly, niacin as well as BHB lowered serum FFA but failed to increase cardiac output [56]. These data strongly suggest that the cardiac effects of BHB are not mediated by HCA2 signaling. This study also possesses clinical value. In addition to cardiac output, BHB ameliorated a number of other cardiac function parameters, including stroke volume, LVEF, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, venous saturation, systolic mitral plane peak excursion velocity, tricuspid annular peak systolic excursion, and oxygen saturation. BHB decreased systemic vascular resistance and slightly, but statistically significantly, reduced mean arterial pressure [56].",
        "Two studies conducted by the same team from Aarhus University in Denmark investigated the effects of a longer oral uptake of BHB [65]. Both studies followed a similar randomized, double-blind crossover design. Twenty-four patients were randomized into two groups that received either ketone ester or isocaloric comparator for 14 days, followed by a 14-day washout period, after which treatment and placebo groups were switched. Participants were analyzed at the end of the 14-day treatment period. One study evaluated non-diabetic HF patients while the second evaluated HF patients with T2D. In nondiabetic HFrEF patients, BHB exerted a marked beneficial effect improving all parameters of cardiac function, including the most important one—stroke volume and LVEF. Systemic vascular resistance was also ameliorated in this cohort [65]. Results in diabetic patients were much more modest. BHB intake improved only cardiac output and average early diastolic velocity and diminished central vascular resistance. Changes in other cardiac parameters were statistically non-significant [66].",
        "The effect of exogenous BHB was also tested in patients with cardiogenic shock KETO-SHOCK1 (NCT04642768) [67]. Half of the patients enrolled in the study had cardiogenic shock due to acute MI. Intravenous infusion of ketone ester for 3 h robustly improved cardiac function compared to the placebo arm [67]. Although the results are promising, the design of the study was not intended to analyze mortality, which is the most important outcome.",
        "The small clinical trials described above make a strong case for exogenous BHB to be considered a promising drug candidate for HF treatment. These short-term human studies are supported by basic research, demonstrating the robust beneficial effect of exogenous BHB long-term treatment in different animal models of HF [42,68,69].",
        "Dyslipidemia plays a highly determining role in cardiovascular health [70]. Being the ligand of HCA2, one may expect BHB to exert an FFA lowering effect, in similarity with the potent action of an HCA2 second ligand—niacin [59]. Indeed, acute studies support this premise. Administration of exogenous BHB decreased FFA in blood in the acute period 1–3 h after infusion [53,54,56]. However, long-term observations yielded the opposite results. In the CANVAS (NCT01032629) and CANVAS-R (NCT01989754) trial cohorts, levels of serum FFA significantly correlated with BHB [71]. In two small studies done in diabetic patients with inhibitors of sodium-glucose transporter 2 (iSGLT2), 1 month of EMPA or 2 weeks of DAPA intake augmented both BHB and FFA levels [72,73]. The discrepancy between acute and long-term studies might be explained by the fact that long-term studies were done in the diabetic population, and T2D is strongly associated with dyslipidemia. This notion could be supported by findings in trials that did not target diabetes specifically. In the PREVEND cohort, high levels of BHB predicted T2D development [30]. A study in HFrEF patients observed simultaneously a strong positive correlation between BHB and FFA and between high levels of BHB and diabetes [22]. Another HF trial demonstrated that high levels of FFA predicted high BHB levels in multi-variable analysis [20]. This data shows that a positive correlation between BHB and diabetes may obscure the FFA-lowering effect of BHB and further research is required.",
        "There is a significant gap in the literature regarding the impact of ketone supplements on blood pressure in humans, particularly in at-risk populations like individuals with hypertension and older adults. Furthermore, additional research is needed to explore the effects of ketone supplements in hypertension [74].",
        "Nielsen et al. (NCT04615754) enrolled 10 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and 10 with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), all having residual pulmonary hypertension. A randomized crossover study was conducted with BHB infusion or placebo. Infusion of BHB raised circulating BHB levels, which resulted in a 27% improvement in cardiac output and a 13% increase in right ventricular systolic velocity. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 18%. No significant difference in response was observed between the PAH and CTEPH groups [75]. In a randomized, double-blinded trial (NCT03452761), 23 participants received either exogenous ketone salt supplementation or placebo two times per day for 6 weeks. Chronic ketone supplementation significantly increased blood ketone levels 30 and 60 min after supplementation and may reduce systolic blood pressure reduction. Another randomized controlled crossover trial (NCT03461068) enrolled 15 participants with obesity. Participants underwent an overnight fast and then consumed either a ketone monoester (KE) drink containing BHB or a taste-matched placebo 30 min prior to performing a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). There were no differences in the area under the curve (AUC) for triglycerides, C-peptides, or insulin following consumption of the KE drink. However, the KE drink led to a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure and an increase in heart rate [76]. A clinical trial (NCT03073356) enrolled patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction. Infusion of BHB resulted in a 40% increase in cardiac output (2 L/min) and an 8% improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. These changes were accompanied by vasodilation, with systemic and pulmonary blood pressures remaining stable [54].",
        "Ketone bodies have long been known to improve the survival of nerve cells, and interestingly, beta cells share significant common genetic and physiological characteristics with neurons [77,78]. Although excessive production of ketones may cause ketoacidosis in diabetic patients, recent studies demonstrate that modest levels of ketones play adaptive and positive roles [79]. Moreover, chronic treatment with BHB improves beta cell function and mitochondrial health in both mice and humans, helps in the recovery from lipotoxic stress, enhances the expression of key genes that are involved in insulin production [80] and might impact viral infection of pancreatic beta cells [81].",
        "In recent years, many studies have been conducted exploring the role of ketone bodies in the progression of diabetes. These studies have used several murine models and cell lines to test the potentially therapeutic effects of ketogenic diets and exogenous ketone supplementation on the development of diabetes and its associated pathologies.",
        "Carbohydrate- and calorie-restricted diets have been successfully used to improve beta cell function and insulin resistance, suggesting that states of ketogenesis may have beneficial effects in T2D [82]. In a study by Zhang et al., mice with T2D were given water treated with 1,3-B. The treatment with medicated water reduced fasting blood glucose levels, improved glucose tolerance, and ameliorated insulin resistance through HCA2 [83].",
        "In a different study, a mouse model of T2D was used to explore the effects of a ketogenic diet on muscle mass and function. The diabetic condition caused a reduction in muscle mass and grip strength, but being placed on a ketogenic diet for 14 weeks ameliorated these effects. Recent studies also demonstrated that following the ketogenic diet intervention, the expression of nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome markers and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-related markers in the muscles of the mice were positively modulated [84]. These findings demonstrate how increasing BHB levels—in this case, by inducing ketosis through feeding mice a ketogenic diet—can improve glucose control and alleviate symptoms of diabetes. Similarly, in a study by Trotta et al., T2D was induced in C57BL6J mice, which caused upregulation of retinal HCA2 receptors, elevation of several retinal ER stress markers, and increased levels of NLRP3 inflammasome activity markers and proinflammatory cytokines. The mice were then treated systematically with intraperitoneal injections of BHB, which resulted in significantly reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and retinal ER stress and NLRP3 activity markers. The investigators concluded that when activated by BHB, HCA2 receptors exert an anti-inflammatory effect on retinal damage induced by diabetes by reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activity and proinflammatory cytokine levels [85]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that BHB improves acute pancreatitis in male Wistar albino rats by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway [86].",
        "The role of the mitochondrial β-oxidation enzyme HADHA in hepatic glucagon response was investigated by Pan and colleagues. Their study found that in high-fat-diet fed mice, HADHA overexpression improved metabolic disorders, and this effect was negated by knockdown of a BHB-producing enzyme. They concluded that BHB is responsible for HADHA’s inhibitory effect on hepatic glucagon response, again highlighting BHB elevation as a promising strategy for treating T2D [87].",
        "Of note, BHB targets the glycogen synthase kinase 3β-controlled nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant response and can diminish podocyte senescence and injury caused by T2D. This effect was observed both in vitro—in podocytes exposed to diabetic milieu—and in vivo—in a murine model of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) [88].",
        "Also, a study by Wan and colleagues examined the role of the BDH1-mediated BHB metabolic pathway in the pathogenesis of DKD. They found that in mouse models of DKD and high glucose HK-2 cells, BDH1 is downregulated. However, induction of BDH1 renal expression reversed fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis in the kidneys of this DKD mouse model, and BDH1 overexpression or BHB treatment protected HK-2 cells from glucotoxicity. These results highlight the potential of ketogenic diets or BHB supplementation as therapeutic approaches to treating DKD progression [89].",
        "Furthermore, Oka et al. explored the role of BHB in the regulation of Trx1, an antioxidant that aids in protecting the heart during the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Their results demonstrated that BHB enhances antioxidant defense in cardiomyocytes through inhibition of HDAC1 and increased stabilization of Trx1, suggesting that increased levels of ketone bodies could protect the hearts of T2D patients against diabetic cardiomyopathy [90].",
        "Interestingly, in mice, the induction of an endogenous ketogenesis deficiency by a whole-body Hmgcs2 deletion shortens the life span, but this effect can be prevented using ketone supplementation with 1,3-B. When aged knockout mice were fed a diet supplemented with 1,3-B, their life spans were extended and mortality rates decreased, thus highlighting the significance of ketone bodies to the process of aging and the metabolic diseases with which it is associated [91].",
        "It has also been shown that BHB offers protective effects in the pancreas and tissues against glutathione (GSH)-deficiency-caused ferroptosis in acute liver failure (ALF) mouse models [92]. Several other studies have concluded that BHB influences pancreatic islet function and hormone regulation. For instance, acute treatment with R-βHB enantiomer of C57BL/6J mouse islets increases insulin secretion and decreases glucagon secretion at physiological glucose levels. This suggests that BHB may contribute to promoting islet cell health and survival [93].",
        "Generally, exogenous ketone supplementation, particularly BHB, may offer therapeutic benefits for T2D by reducing hyperglycemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress [94]. Several clinical trials have been conducted to explore whether the therapeutic benefits of ketogenic diets and exogenous ketone supplementation that have been demonstrated in murine and cell models can also be observed in healthy individuals, as well as patients living with or at risk of diabetes.",
        "In a clinical study with women on long-standing ketosis, Cooper and collaborators found that sustained ketosis can alleviate hyperinsulinemia without diminishing metabolic flexibility, which may provide several benefits in counteracting chronic diseases and biological aging [95].",
        "Moreover, Yu et al. investigated the effects of ketone supplementation on blood BHB, glucose, and insulin levels in a population with obesity and prediabetes. Their studies found that BHB exhibits a glucose-lowering effect without increasing insulin, which points to the potential therapeutic benefits of exogenous ketone supplementation for individuals who have or are at risk of T2D [96].",
        "In young individuals, consumption of a ketone monoester supplement 30 min prior to a glucose tolerance test reduced both glycemic response and insulin sensitivity markers without altering insulin secretion. These results point to the future therapeutic potential of ketone supplements as glucose-lowering agents in the management of metabolic diseases [97].",
        "A recent study investigated whether BHB can suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion: liposaccharide-stimulated leukocytes from overnight-fasted adults at risk for T2D were treated with BHB, and results showed that BHB treatment suppressed secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-16 while increasing secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Ra and IL-10 [98].",
        "The effects of two novel ketone supplements—with slightly different chemical makeups from ketone monoesters—on blood BHB and glucose levels were investigated in healthy individuals. It was found that following ingestion, BHB levels were raised and glucose levels decreased, comparable to that of an already established ketone monoester supplement [99].",
        "Soto-Mota et al. investigated the effects of L-alanine supplementation on the glucose-lowering effect of exogenous ketone supplementation, as L-alanine is a gluconeogenic substrate secreted at higher levels in patients with T2D. The study found that in healthy patients supplemented with both exogenous ketones and L-alanine after 24 h of fasting, the ketosis-induced drop in blood glucose levels was significantly reduced. The authors concluded that the glucose-lowering effect of increased blood BHB levels is partially due to BHB decreasing the availability of L-alanine as a substrate for gluconeogenesis [100].",
        "While the therapeutic benefits of exogenous ketone monoesters on blood glucose levels have been demonstrated, downsides such as unpleasant taste and gastrointestinal discomfort highlight the need for novel supplements. Moreover, BHB also appears to support pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) growth and metastasis by serving as an alternative energy source, with the enzyme HMG-CoA lyase (HMGCL) playing a key role in ketogenesis [101].",
        "These studies demonstrate promise in using ketogenic diets and exogenous ketone supplementation to treat diabetes, but more studies need to be conducted to fully elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effects that have been observed thus far.",
        "iSGLT2s, also known as gliflozins or flozins, are a class of medications that are widely used in the treatment of T2D due to their ability to lower blood glucose levels [102,103,104,105,106].",
        "SGLT2 is predominantly expressed in the renal tubules of the kidneys and is responsible for reabsorbing 90% of glucose. As a result, any excess glucose is eliminated through urine [107,108,109,110,111,112].",
        "Primarily developed as anti-diabetic medication, iSGLT2 recently became a pharmacological blockbuster after the discovery of their diabetes-independent cardioprotective effect [113,114]. The mechanism of cardio protection elicited by iSGLT2s remains elusive. In this section, we will describe animal and human studies analyzing the role of BHB in iSGLT2 protection against cardiovascular disease (CVD).",
        "The iSGLT2s that are FDA-approved for the treatment of T2D patients include canagliflozin (CANA), DAPA, EMPA, and Ertugliflozin (ERTU).",
        "A major effect of iSGLT2s observed in animal studies is the cardiac remodeling effect. In one of the very first rodent model studies by Byrne et al., mice with induced HF treated for 14 days with EMPA were significantly protected from the progressive deterioration of cardiac function characterizing vehicle-treated mice [115]. Further studies investigated potential pathways influencing iSGLT2s’ cardiac remodeling effects in rodents, suggesting mechanisms involving anti-metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects [116], protection from oxidative stress [117], and a possible microbiota involvement [118]. iSGLT2s improved exercise endurance capacity in HF mice, without affecting cardiac functions post-MI [119], and increased lipolysis [120], through a mechanism suggesting the activation of the AMPK pathway [121] and the increase in BHB levels [122].",
        "Due to the pig model’s suitability to elucidate metabolic queries of the human metabolism, there are a few iSGLT2s pig model studies. The findings from these analyses revolve mainly around metabolic alterations following MI and iSGLT2s treatment, with a focus on the cardiac remodeling. Baker et al. investigated the impact of canagliflozin (CANA) on contractile function, substrate utilization, and efficiency before and during regional MI in normal, metabolically healthy pigs, demonstrating a preservation of cardiac contractile function and efficiency during acute regional MI through acute effects on cardiac volume regulation [123]. Moreover, in another study, DAPA decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and alleviated the sympathetic tension in the aorta [124]. Similarly, EMPA improved myocardial energetics and cardiac functions through the shift in myocardial fuel metabolism away from glucose and towards cardiac utilization of ketone bodies, free fatty acids, and branched-chain amino acids [125].",
        "A study conducted by Baartscheer et al. demonstrated a clear effect of EMPA in rabbits, resulting in the improvement of heart arrhythmia, oxidative stress, and heart failure [126]. Another group in a more recent study showed that treatment with DAPA reduces the development of atherosclerotic lesions in a normoglycemic rabbit model, suppressing lipid accumulation, intimal proliferation, and pro-inflammatory marker levels, suggesting beneficial anti-atherosclerotic effects of iSGLT2s [127].",
        "Currently one zebrafish animal model study of iSGLT2s’ cardioprotective effects has been conducted: in this study, Shi et al. examined biomarker changes elicited by EMPA in a model of heart failure. Interestingly, HF was completely reversed in zebrafish embryos exposed to aristolochic acid; finally, EMPA also decreased the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β [128].",
        "Mounting evidence provides incontestable support for SGLT2 inhibitors’ ability to promote ketogenesis. On top of anecdotal reports of euglycemic ketoacidosis caused by iSGLT2 [129,130,131], an increase in physiological concentrations of BHB have been recorded in several clinical trials. In a small trial evaluating the effects of DAPA in prediabetic insulin-resistant individuals, BHB levels were higher in the treatment group compared to the placebo [72]. In a trial on diabetic patients with CVD risk, a 30-day course of EMPA or glimepiride significantly increased BHB levels compared to the sulfonylurea-treated group [73]. The comparison to another anti-diabetic drug rather than a placebo is the great advantage of this study. Such design allows an assessment of whether BHB upregulation is specific for iSGLT2 or results from the glucose lowering effect. Indeed, both treatments decreased levels of glycated albumin during the trial period, suggesting that increased ketogenesis is the unique feature of gliflozin-class medications [73]. Treatment with metformin in another study was not associated with changes in BHB levels, further supporting this notion [24]. In the trial “DAPA Effects on Biomarkers, Symptoms and Functional Status in Patients with HF With Reduced Ejection Fraction” (DEFINE-HF, NCT02653482), metabolic profiling of 234 participants revealed higher BHB levels in the DAPA group [132].",
        "Post-analysis of the multicenter phase 3b randomized controlled trial EMMY (Impact of EMpagliflozin on Cardiac Function and Biomarkers of Heart Failure in Patients with Acute MYocardial Infarction, NCT03087773) revealed strong indirect evidence for the protective role of BHB upon iSGLT2 treatment. The EMMY study evaluated the effect of EMPA on acute MI, and a significant amelioration of cardiac function parameters was observed [133]. A post-analysis demonstrated that EMPA treatment was associated with higher levels of BHB [26]. Moreover, an increase in BHB levels during the study period was associated with better heart function and lower MI markers [26].",
        "iSGLT2s protect against DKD by increasing endogenous ketone body levels, which counteract mTORC1 hyperactivation in damaged proximal tubules [134].",
        "DAPA mitigated oxidative stress and cellular senescence by elevating BHB levels [135,136]. Specifically, in chronic heart failure murine models, DAPA protected against heart failure through macrophage inhibition rather than SGLT2 inhibition [137]. DAPA also had a positive effect on cardiac microvascular dysfunction and endothelial injury during ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) by inhibiting the XO-SERCA2-CaMKII-cofilin pathway. This led to improved endothelial barrier function, reduced apoptosis, and preserved microvascular integrity [138]. Furthermore, DAPA alleviated DKD and modulated gut microbiota over time, with improved gut flora composition and bile acid [139]. DAPA also supports human islet function in a hyperglycemic environment as it increases alpha and beta cell proliferation and reduces apoptosis in xeno-transplanted diabetic mice. It also potentially promotes alpha-to-beta cell transdifferentiation [140].",
        "EMPA elevates circulating and myocardial ketone levels, thus improving cardiac function in non-diabetic mice with acute myocardial dysfunction [141]. EMPA is also able to reduce weight gain and insulin resistance by enhancing energy expenditure, shifting metabolism towards fat utilization, and promoting the browning of adipose tissue in obese mice. Additionally, in a recent study, EMPA mitigated inflammation by polarizing macrophages towards the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype [142]. This drug protected the heart by suppressing autophagic cell death in cardiomyocytes by inhibiting Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1), reducing infarct size and myocardial fibrosis, and improving cardiac function in myocardial infarction models [143]. Furthermore, EMPA improved cardiac function and reduced ferroptosis, fibrosis, apoptosis, and inflammation in doxorubicin-treated mice via NLRP3- and MyD88-related pathways [144]. In diabetic mice, EMPA accelerated atherosclerosis regression by reducing plaque size and enhanced vascular health [116]. Moreover, it prevented diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis in mice, improving metabolic health and muscle mitochondrial morphology regardless of diet type [145]. EMPA reduced hyperuricemia by upregulating the uric acid transporter ABCG2 via AMPK/AKT/CREB signaling pathway, contributing to its therapeutic effects in T2D [146]. It also enhanced cardiac energy by increasing cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP levels, improving cardiac robustness, and aiding recovery from ischemia–reperfusion injury, which may contribute to its heart failure benefits in clinical trials [146]. Li et al. demonstrated that EMPA improved the structure and function of the diabetic heart, reduced oxidative stress, and mitigated myocardial fibrosis in T2D KK-Ay mice by inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad pathway and activating the NRF2/ARE signaling pathway [117]. NRF2 exacerbates DKD by upregulating certain genes, leading to lipid accumulation in renal proximal tubular cells. SGLT2 inhibition with EMPA improved endothelial function and reduced arterial stiffness in aged mice [147]. Another study conducted by Tan et al. demonstrated that EMPA elevates circulating and myocardial ketone levels, thus improving cardiac function in non-diabetic mice with acute myocardial dysfunction [141]. A combination of EMPA and metformin improved islet endothelial function and insulin secretion in diabetic mice, with EMPA showing superior effects and a combination of both drugs yielding the greatest benefit [148].",
        "Ertugliflozin (ERTU) instead enhances left ventricular function and reduces fibrosis in a murine pressure overload model by increasing AMPK signaling and ketone body utilization while decreasing insulin signaling and mTOR pathway activation [149].",
        "iSGLT2s increase the plasma glucagon/insulin ratio, thus enhancing ketone body production in vivo, but this effect does not result from a direct action on human pancreatic islet cells [150]. As mentioned earlier, numerous clinical studies have reported that iSGLT2s elevate BHB levels. For instance, in a clinical trial conducted by Scarr et al., they reported that iSGLT2 increased BHB levels in serum and urine by upregulating ketogenic enzymes in various organs, with a more pronounced effect observed in women [151]. iSGLT2s elevated BHB levels and increased the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), although long-term use in T2D patients showed moderate increases in ketone levels related to cardiometabolic benefits [152,153].",
        "iSGLT2s reduced diabetes-induced metabolic perturbations in kidney biopsies from treated patients by suppressing mTORC1 signaling, particularly affecting glycolysis and TCA cycle pathways [154]. Moreover, they reduce hyperglycemia and offer cardiovascular and kidney benefits potentially mediated by increased ketone levels, which have anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. However, these benefits come with a risk of ketoacidosis, particularly in T1D, highlighting a possible ‘double-edged sword’ effect of the drug class. Hence, they are best used in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents [155,156]. iSGLT2s have shown promising cardiac and renal protective effects, even in non-diabetic patients. They play a role in redox homeostasis and offer potential therapeutic benefits across various diseases, including liver diseases, neural disorders, and cancers [157]. Additionally, iSGLT2s showed potential as anti-aging therapies due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects, impacting pathways like AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α and reducing oxidative stress. Further human studies are needed to explore their role in age-related diseases and inflammation [158].",
        "DAPA not only lowered blood glucose but also enhanced beta cell regeneration in T2D by promoting beta cell self-replication, alpha-to-beta cell conversion, and duct-derived beta cell neogenesis, partially mediated by GLP-1 [159].",
        "EMPA reduced high glucose-induced inflammation and fibrosis in human kidney proximal tubular cells by inhibiting glucose transport and did not affect SGLT1/GLUT2 expression [160]. EMPA also significantly decreased liver fat without affecting myocardial fat [161]. Another study has shown that EMPA improved DKD by reducing mitochondrial fission via the AMPK/SP1/PGAM5 pathway, with effects diminished by AMPK inhibition [162,163]. Kim et al. demonstrated that EMPA exerts cardioprotective effects by mitigating NLRP3 inflammasome activation, increasing cardiac ketone oxidation, and decreasing serum insulin levels in T2D and CVD patients [73].",
        "CANA reduced myocardial NADPH oxidase activity and improved nitric oxide synthase coupling via the SGLT1/AMPK/Rac1 signaling pathway, resulting in significant anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic outcomes in the human myocardium [164]. Moreover, CANA enhanced T cell-mediated cytotoxicity by promoting PD-L1 degradation, thus offering a potential strategy to overcome tumor immune evasion [165].",
        "Matsubayashi and colleagues reported that tofogliflozin, another iSGLT2, significantly increases hepatic insulin clearance, reduces triglyceride levels, and elevates BHB levels, as well as contributes to hyperinsulinemia correction in T2D patients [166].",
        "Interestingly, elevated serum BHB levels could potentially worsen the inflammatory immune response in patients with alopecia areata, with higher levels correlating with the severity of hair loss [167].",
        "Ketone bodies represent natural compounds that our body produces to cope with stress conditions. In addition to their role as glucose-sparing energy carriers, ketones are involved in a variety of molecular signaling functions that may influence a broad range of human diseases [168,169]. Ketones are indeed essential for postnatal heart development; in fact, their deficiency impairs mitochondrial maturation and heart function [170].",
        "In recent years, there has been considerable interest in these molecules as food supplements due to their potential for improved athletic performance and therapeutic glucose-lowering effects in people with diabetes. Of note, exogenous ketone supplements may be of particular interest for individuals living with T1D, by serving as an alternative fuel substrate to reduce the reliance on glucose utilization, sparing endogenous glycogen, and reducing the risk of hypoglycemia in certain situations, such as exercise. Moreover, recent studies raise the intriguing question of whether circulating ketone bodies may directly modulate immune cell function, providing a premise for future investigations into the potential role of these metabolites in other autoimmune diseases.",
        "Specifically, a functional role as a key signaling molecule is increasingly acknowledged for BHB, the most abundant ketone circulating in the human body. Low millimolar concentrations of BHB may improve endothelial function and vascular health by modulating inflammation, senescence, and metabolism [171]. Recently, we and others have reported that BHB attenuates maladaptive chromatin remodeling and mitochondrial dysfunction in postischemic heart failure, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent in cardiovascular health [42]. BHB modulates a number of signaling pathways with implications for several metabolic disease; interestingly, it is an endogenous inhibitor of many NAD+-independent HDACs, potentially having a direct effect on glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function [90,172,173,174,175,176]. A graphical summary of ketone’s protective effects on heart and pancreatic beta cells is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "Considering the tremendous translational potential of ketone bodies in CVD and diabetes, and the bottleneck in efforts to develop potential therapeutics in both fields, especially in elderly people, this area is worthy of attention and might significantly improve the lives of patients living with these diseases.",

        "Ketone bodies are produced in the organism during carbohydrate or general nutrient insufficiency like fasting or ketogenic diet. Among all ketone bodies, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is the most abundant and its levels in circulation are changing much faster. The predominant source of BHB is the liver. Under specific disease conditions, other organs, like kidneys and the heart, could produce substantial amounts of BHB. Inhibitors of Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 (iSGLT2) were reliably demonstrated to promote ketogenesis. In addition to conventional sites of BHB production, iSGLT2 was found to promote ketosis in macrophages and CD8+ T cells. However, the role of unconventional sites of ketosis in whole-body BHB balance remains inconclusive. Exogenous supplementation of BHB is a highly efficient and safe way to increase circulating levels of BHB. In a series of clinical trials exogenous BHB supplementation was demonstrated to exert beneficial action on heart failure and diabetes."

    "title": "Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell and mononuclear cell combination therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled study with 8-year follow-up. mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with mononuclear cells (MCs) in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: T2DM patients were divided into the combination group (Dual MSC + MC, n = 33), the mononuclear cell group (MC-Only, n = 32) and the control group (Control, n = 31). All groups were treated with insulin and metformin. The Dual MSC + MC group additionally received MSC and MC infusion and the MC-Only group additionally received MC infusion. The patients were followed up for 8 years. The primary endpoint was the C-peptide area under the curve (C-p AUC) at 1 year. This study was registered with clinicaltrial.gov (NCT01719640). RESULTS: A total of 97 patients were included and 89 completed the follow-up. The area under the curve of C-peptide of the Dual MSC + MC group and the MC-Only group was significantly increased (50.6% and 32.8%, respectively) at 1 year. After eight years of follow-up, the incidence of macrovascular complications was 13.8% (p = 0.009) in the Dual MSC + MC group and 21.4% (p = 0.061) in the MC-Only group, while it was 44.8% in the Control group. The incidence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was 10.3% (p = 0.0015) in the Dual MSC + MC group, 17.9% (p = 0.015) in the MC-Only group, and 48.3% in the Control group. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of MSC and MC therapy can reduce the incidence of chronic diabetes complications and improves metabolic control with mild side effects in T2DM patients.

      "abstract": "Background To investigate the long-term effects of combining bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with mononuclear cells (MCs) in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods T2DM patients were divided into the combination group (Dual MSC + MC, n = 33), the mononuclear cell group (MC-Only, n = 32) and the control group (Control, n = 31). All groups were treated with insulin and metformin. The Dual MSC + MC group additionally received MSC and MC infusion and the MC-Only group additionally received MC infusion. The patients were followed up for 8 years. The primary endpoint was the C-peptide area under the curve (C-p AUC) at 1 year. This study was registered with clinicaltrial.gov (NCT01719640). Results A total of 97 patients were included and 89 completed the follow-up. The area under the curve of C-peptide of the Dual MSC + MC group and the MC-Only group was significantly increased (50.6% and 32.8%, respectively) at 1 year. After eight years of follow-up, the incidence of macrovascular complications was 13.8% ( p = 0.009) in the Dual MSC + MC group and 21.4% ( p = 0.061) in the MC-Only group, while it was 44.8% in the Control group. The incidence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was 10.3% ( p = 0.0015) in the Dual MSC + MC group, 17.9% ( p = 0.015) in the MC-Only group, and 48.3% in the Control group. Conclusions The combination of MSC and MC therapy can reduce the incidence of chronic diabetes complications and improves metabolic control with mild side effects in T2DM patients.",

        "Diabetes mellitus is a significant chronic disease affecting millions of people worldwide, with the population projected to reach 1.8 billion by 2030. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for 90% of these cases [1] and is associated with chronic complications, including macrovascular and microvascular complications, which remain the main cause of mortality [2]. While conventional hypoglycemic agents barely aim at improving islet function, regenerative approaches such as stem cell therapy has shown great promise [3–5]. Studies have demonstrated the potential of stem cells including tissue repair, regeneration and immunomodulation, with recent clinical trials showing improved metabolic control and islet function in T2DM [3, 6]. However, insulin independence has been scarce among patients, and modifications to cell regimens are necessary. Various cell classes including bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), bone marrow mononuclear cells (MC) and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells have been employed in different studies. Based on our experience [7], the combination of different classes of cells is also feasible. Furthermore, the improvement in chronic diabetes complications by stem cell therapy was only reported in animal experiments [8–10]. Given the promising preliminary findings on the individual effects of MSCs and MCs in treating T2DM, this study aims to explore the long-term impacts of their combined use. By assessing the outcomes over an 8-year period, we seek to determine whether the combination of MSCs and MCs can offer superior benefits in improving metabolic control and reducing chronic complications compared to MCs alone or standard therapy.",
        "Type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed based on the 2008 criteria of American Diabetes Association. The inclusion criteria were age ≥ 40 and ≤ 65 years, body mass index (BMI) ≤ 35 kg/m2, onset age ≥ 35 years, history ≥ 3 and ≤ 15 years, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 7.5 and ≤ 12%, fasting c-peptide ≥ 0.3 and ≤ 2.0 ng/mL, medication with stable doses of exogenous insulin and metformin over the previous 3 months. The rationale for the high limit of BMI and c-peptide level was to mitigate the possibility of marked insulin resistance compromising islet function. The exclusion criteria were evidence of renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl (males) and 1.4 mg/dl (females)), proteinuria > 300 mg/day, diabetic retinopathy, chronic pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, hemorrhagic disease, abdominal aneurysm, chronic systematic inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] > 3.0 mmol/L), liver enzymes > 1.5 × upper limit of normal, severe coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction within the past 6 months or active angina), heart failure stages III ~ IV, poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia, pregnancy or lack of approved contraception, and malignancy.",
        "Patients eligible to initial criteria underwent a 4-month run-in phase of standard medical treatment (SMT), which included insulin injection, metformin (2 g per day, orally), exercise (2–3 km two times a week), and healthy diet as counseled by an endocrinologist. At the end of run-in phase, patients were screened for randomization criteria, which included HbA1c ≥ 7.5 and ≤ 9.5%, insulin daily dose ≤ 1.0 units/day/kg, controlled blood pressure (systolic BP < 140 mmHg or diastolic BP < 90 mmHg) and controlled hyperlipidemia (fasting low density lipoprotein cholesterol > 130 mg/dL; and/or fasting triglycerides > 200 mg/dL). Then, eligible patients were randomized into the Dual MSC + MC group, the MC-Only group and the Control group. BM collection and MSC culture were performed for the Dual MSC + MC group. When the number of MSCs were reached approximately 2 × 106/kg (total numbers varied based on patient body weight), the patients were admitted to the center and underwent BM collection again to harvest mass volume. The MC-Only group only underwent mass BM collection. The two groups were infused intraarterially with MSCs (1 × 106/kg) plus MCs or MCs alone, respectively. The Dual MSC + MC group received another dose of MSCs (1 × 106/kg) intravenously at 1 week. Exogenous insulin and metformin were maintained for all three groups for one year. After 1 year, the patients were referred to primary physicians. Before the 8-year follow-up, the patients were reached by phone and subjected to SMT again for 3 months to achieve stable insulin (fluctuated within 10%) and metformin (2 g per day) doses.",
        "The patients were tested for the infection of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses, and syphilis before the operation. The patient was placed in prone position, and bone marrow was aspired from both posterior superior iliac spine under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine. The syringes were pre-treated with heparin saline to prevent clotting and loss of BM. For MSC culture, 100mL BM was collected. For MC separation, a minimum of 350 ml and a maximum of 380 ml of bone marrow were collected and mixed with 20,000 units of heparin and preservative in a Quadruple Collection Bag (Terumo Medical Corporation, Changchun, China).",
        "The heparinized BM was mixed with an equal volume of low glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (LG-DMEM) and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min. The fat and supernatant were discarded. After resuspended with LG-DMEM, an equal volume of Percoll (1.073 g/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was gently added and centrifuged at 2000 g for 25 min. The mononuclear layer was separated and resuspended with LG-DMEM and plated to 75 cm2 flask in a 37 ℃ humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The medium was renewed every 48–72 h, and nonadherent cells were discarded. After incubation for 5–7days and reaching 80% confluence, cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA, replated at a density of 0.5–1 × 106 cells in flasks and incubated. The cells of passage 5 were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline for infusion. As per standard practice at our center and in accordance with 2006 International Society for Cellular Therapy criteria, we performed cell surface marker analysis (Coulter EPICS XL Flow Cytometer acquisition report) and showed that UC-MSCs were positive for CD29, CD73, CD90, and CD105 and negative for CD34 and CD45. Batch testing for bacteria, mycoplasma, fungi, and endotoxin were performed before release for infusion. The cells can only be infused into the patient when all tests are negative, to prevent the risk of pancreatic injury.",
        "The Quadruple Collection Bag was placed upside down the centrifuge (Beckman, J-26) and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min. The red cells were gravitated into the second bag from the primary bag and then discarded, the buffy coat and some plasma were collected in the third bag, and the remaining plasma and fat discarded with the primary bag. The buffy coat was washed and resuspended in isotonic normal saline in the third bag, which a volume of approximately 500 ml. The bag was centrifuged again at 2000 g for 15 min to separate the resident plasma and fat from the buffy coat. After the procedure the MCs were transported for immediate infusion.",
        "This invasive procedure is performed by a senior surgeon of interventional therapy at the center for all patients. Patients underwent angiography of the celiac axis and splenic artery. In all subjects a large vessel consistent with the dorsal pancreatic artery was identified and confirmed to feed the pancreatic body and tail with digital subtraction angiography. After the artery was cannulated, MSCs and/or MCs, which were dispensed in several 20mL syringes, were infused slowly. Previous studies at our center have confirmed that the procedure was safe [7, 11].",
        "The primary endpoint was the C-peptide area under the curve (C-p AUC) at 1 year. Secondary endpoints included serum insulin AUC, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), exogenous insulin requirement (daily dose per kg), and fasting C-peptide at 1 year as well as the incidence of macrovascular and microvascular complications assessed over an 8-year period. Macrovascular complications included myocardial infarction (MI), angina, stroke and amputation, and microvascular complications included diabetes nephropathy (DN), and diabetes retinopathy (DRP, both non-proliferative DRP and proliferative). Other secondary endpoints included the incidence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and safety.",
        "C-p-AUC and insulin AUC were determined by the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The OGTT was performed at fasting status > 12 h from the last insulin injection at admission, 6 months, 1 year and 8 years. Blood samples for the detection of serum C-p and insulin levels were collected at -10, -5, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min in OGTT. The C-p-AUC and insulin AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal method. Blood samples were collected at fasting status at admission and 3, 6, and 9 months and 1 year post-infusion for FBG (hexokinase method, AU2700, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), HbA1c (high-performance liquid chromatography assay, Variant II, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and C-peptide (chemiluminescent immunoassay, Advia Centaur XP, Siemens, Munich, Germany).",
        "Myocardial infarction (MI), angina, stroke and amputation were recorded based on medical history from primary care and local hospitals. According to the third generic definition of myocardial infarction, MI and angina can be recognized by clinical features, including electrocardiographic findings, elevated values of biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis, and by imaging, or may be defined by pathology. The diagnosis of stroke may be based on: acute onset, focal neurological deficits, and in a few cases, total neurological deficits, symptoms and signs lasting for more than a few hours, and brain CT or MR to exclude cerebral hemorrhage and other lesions with responsible infarct lesions. These were confirmed by physical examination, electrocardiograph and magnetic resonance imaging at the center. Diabetes nephropathy (DN), and diabetes retinopathy (DRP, both non-proliferative DRP and proliferative) were assessed at the center. When microalbuminuria exceeded 30 mg in a 24-hour urine collection (Afinion AS100; Alere Medical Sales Co Ltd, Shanghai, China), the presence of DN was considered. The diagnosis of DN was confirmed in two out of three samples collected over a 3- to 6-month period. DRP was diagnosed using the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy classification scale. An ophthalmologist examined patients’ retinas and photographed, and an independent ophthalmologist reviewed the images and confirmed the diagnosis.",
        "DPN was defined by a neurothesiometer reading > 25 V and/or positive monofilament test in two or more sites in either foot and/or Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument questionnaire score [12]. According to previous studies [7, 11], Safety included amylase level (an indicator for post-intervention pancreatitis), incidence of infectious diseases (such as upper respiratory tract infection), CRP, white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, serum creatinine level and alanine transaminase at 3-month intervals.",
        "Insulin titration was based on targets of fasting blood glucose levels of 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) and 2 h after meals 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L), respectively. The dose of insulin was reduced by 1–2 IU if patients presented clinical findings of hypoglycemia and/or blood glucose levels less than 4.9 mmol/L (90 mg/dL). Metformin doses were maintained unless the patients became insulin-independent. All changes in doses were ordered by the endocrinologist of the team (Z W).",
        "A computer-generated block randomization was used to assign each subject to one of the three groups. Statistical analysis was performed using software GraphPad Prism 9.0. Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Power and sample size considerations assume a 30% increase of C-p-AUC at 1 year post-infusion from an average of 300 ng/mL per 180 min in Chinese patients with T2DM. The ANOVA considered three independent groups with 20 patients per group, providing adequate power to detect this assumed difference (type I error = 0.05 and 90% power). The Chi-square test and two-factor repeated-measures ANOVA were used for three-group numeration data comparison, and three-group repeated-measures comparison, respectively. A value of P < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. For numeration data, per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were used. PP analysis included only those patients who had completed the follow-up schedule of the study. On the other hand, the ITT analysis included all patients who had finished 1-year follow-up, even those who had dropped out of the 8-year follow-up.",

Two patients in both the Dual MSC + MC group and the MC-Only group experienced hemorrhage at puncture site, respectively, which were resolved with local pressure. Two patients in the Dual MSC + MC group experienced fever and chill after intraoperative infusion and venous infusion, respectively, which relieved after symptomatic treatment. No cases of postoperative acute pancreatitis occurred.",
        "Within 1 year, two cases of neutropenia were observed in the Dual MSC + MC group, while none was in the other two groups. There were six, seven and five cases of upper respiratory tract infection in the Dual MSC + MC, MC-Only and Control groups (p > 0.05), respectively. No episodes of severe hypoglycemia were reported within 1 year.",
        "No death event was reported at the 8-year follow-up visit. One case of lung cancer and one case of gastric cancer occurred in the MC-Only group and the Control group, respectively. No patients in the Dual MSC + MC group developed malignancies.",
        "In this study, combined cell therapy was performed based on the rationale that MSCs may alleviate chronic inflammation in the pancreas [13] and promote endogenous regeneration [14], and that MCs may conduce to microenvironmental revascularization [15] and support the role of MSCs. The rational for not setting MSC group was that MC infusion alone was demonstrated to be effective in T2DM in our previous study while the efficacy of intraarterial MSC infusion alone were lack of solid evidence in trials [16]. To the best of our knowledge, few trials have explored combined cell therapy in T2DM.",
        "It is well acknowledged that a large portion of T2DM mortality is relevant to chronic diabetes complications [1]. Recent clinical trials have preliminarily demonstrated that MSC therapy (by intravenous infusion) in T2DM markedly improved metabolic control [3, 17]. However, the effects on chronic diabetes complications in T2DM patients remain unknown [18]. The current study found that autologous bone marrow MSCs plus MCs significantly improved metabolic control and prevented chronic complications. The results showed that the treatment could reduce the risks of both macrovascular and microvascular complications, and DPN. With respect to specific chronic complications, incidence of angina was reduced. Although differences were observed in myocardial infarction, stroke, amputation, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy between groups, these changes were not statistically significant. In a small-scale randomized controlled trial on type 1 DM, the therapy with a combination of umbilical cord MSCs and MCs has shown positive outcomes of prevention of chronic diabetes complications [7]. To date, the available evidence of prevention of chronic diabetes complications largely remains in animal models. Scalinci et al. found that neuroprotective growth factors were significantly increased in DR rats injected with hMSCs [19]. In T2DM rats treated with multiple intravenous MSC infusions, Han et al. showed that DPN symptoms, motor and sensory nerve function were restored [20].",
        "The combined cell therapy improved metabolic control in T2DM patients, including HbA1c, FBG, insulin dose and fasting c-p at 1 year. It was noted that several patients in the Dual MSC + MC group had achieved insulin independence at 1 year, suggestive of a promising prospect of the modified cell regimen. Liu et al. found that treatment with Wharton’s Jelly-derived MSC improved metabolic control and beta cell function in patients with T2DM [3]. Bhansali et al. showed that both BM-MSCs and MCs resulted in sustained reduction in insulin doses, increase in C-peptide response and improvement in insulin sensitivity with MSCs in T2DM [21]. However, insulin independence was rarely seen. Although metabolic control at 8 years was significantly worse than that at 1 year, it was still significantly better than that in the Control group, suggesting that the improved islet function was degenerating in a prolonged manner. The reason for the deterioration may include the persistence of insulin resistance syndrome.",
        "This study monitored intervention-related adverse events and short- and long-term adverse events related to MSC and MC infusion. Intervention-related adverse events, including transient abdominal pain and puncture site bleeding, were mild. The short-term adverse events of MSC infusion were mainly fever and chills, which were presumed to be unrelated to the MSCs but possibly related to the residue of conditioned medium, which might contain allergens and endotoxins. Few studies have described long-term adverse events of stem cell treatment. The long-term outcomes showed that Dual MSC + MC group did not have significantly higher tumor incidence than other groups.",
        "The mechanisms underlying the benefit of combination therapy may include improved islet function and repair of lesioned tissues. It seemed the reduction in the risk of chronic complications could not be fully explained by the improvement in metabolic control [22]. It is accepted that MSCs may exert systemic therapeutic effects on potentially lesioned organs via the anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing properties [23]. Although patients with clinically detectable complications were excluded in the study, as is well known, preclinical impairment to organs occurs in DM patients before diabetes complications were diagnosed [24]. Furthermore, impaired organs may experience regeneration and self-renewal due to the property of inducing and activating organ-specific stem cells by MSCs [25]. Basically, the mechanism of benefit remains unclear and further study is required to verify the speculative explanations provided.",
        "Limitations of this study include the small sample size and the evaluation of complications was done at the 8-year time point, which was not longitudinal.",
        "The results from the 8-year assessment of T2DM patients treated with combined stem cell therapy suggest that the treatment is associated with long-term improved metabolic control and reduced incidence of chronic diabetes complications. Notably, it is safe without severe long-term concerns. These findings support further testing of this treatment in T2DM in a larger scale study. Specific chronic complications can be selected in the design to clarify whether the improvement is universal or organ-specific so as to conduct corresponding fundamental studies.",
