        "The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has made an invaluable contribution to the field of regenerative medicine, paving way for identifying the true potential of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

        "The science around terminal inactivation and deletion of genetic codes of heredity in somatic cells was postulated by the Weismann barrier theory [1]. The somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) demonstration asserted the fact that the genetic code in somatic cells is not discarded, and that reactivation of the same is a possibility through careful manipulations [2]. Developmental biology entered a new dimension of achievement when the discovery of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and their pluripotency was exhibited, and further research identified that on fusion of somatic cells like fibroblasts, and T-lymphocytes with ESCs, reprogramming of the former through expression of genes associated with pluripotency becomes a possibility [3,4]. The findings around SCNT and ESC fusion identified the possibility of reversion in somatic cells indicating the presence of reprogramming factors that bear the potential to act as epigenetic memory erasing factors [5]. The earliest study around generation of pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts was linked to introduction of four crucial transcription factors including octamer binding transcription factor 3/4 (Oct3/4), sex determining region Y—box 2 (SRY-Sox2), Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), and cellular-Myelocytomatosis (c-Myc) (OSKM) [6]. The allogenic trait of ESCs, risk of immune rejection in the recipient along with need for lifetime immunosuppression, and the ethicality around using the same, makes human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) an established candidate for regenerative therapies as they were found to not impact the host immune system [7]. The introduction of the iPSCs technology happened in the year 2006, and since then multiple observational studies have recounted its impact on cardiac diseases, ophthalmic conditions, as well as neurological disorders [8,9,10]. Figure 1 highlights the process of generating iPS cells.",
        "The nuclear reprogramming strategies, without compromising on safety and quality for therapeutic applications, include the integrative or nonintegrative transfer systems using viral or nonviral vectors. The first iPSCs were generated by integrating viral vectors, more popularly the retrovirus wherein the resultant iPSCs exhibited failure in complete expression of endogenous genes of pluripotency [11]. The more efficient viral vector has been documented to be the lentiviral vector (LV), which has recorded a reprogramming efficiency of between 0.1–1% [12,13,14]. To ensure increased safety for therapeutics, nonviral integrative systems have also been worked upon involving use of two plasmids; once encoding for c-Myc, and the other for the four reprogramming factors [15]. However, this system was also shown to have risk of integration, and low reprogramming efficiency. In case of nonintegrative nonviral systems for reprogramming, delivery of pluripotency marker genes has been done using self-replicating vectors, and cytoplasmic RNA. Though easy to work with, the reprogramming efficiency has been found to be lower than LV [16]. Today, research has identified possibility of successful reprogramming using microRNAs (miRNAs) which exhibit improved efficiency, wherein use of c-Myc has been replaced with miR-291-3p, miR-294, and miR-295 to generate homogenous colonies of human iPSCs [17]. The reprogramming methods have been highlighted in Table 1.",
        "There are many assays, including molecular and functional, to evaluate the developmental efficiency of iPSCs. These include alkaline phosphatase staining of pluripotency markers, DNA demethylation, retroviral silencing, and factor independence involving assessment of self-renewal in the absence of dox-inducible trans genes. The functional assays include teratoma formation, chimera development, tetraploid complementation, germline transmission, and in vitro differentiation [14]. Considering the low reprogramming efficiency in iPSCs, many studies have identified blocks in lineage conversion. Reprogramming pathway studies in fibroblasts have identified the repel factor to be involved in mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and BMP receptor signaling [27,28]. Further studies on the refractory fibroblasts indicate negative iPSC generation in spite of prolonged culturing and presence of homogeneous factor expression indicating loss of somatic program, and activation of endogenous pluripotency genes to be the main roadblocks in formation of iPSCs [14]. The other limiting factor has been linked to expression levels of Nanog locus which are activated late in the reprogramming process and thus limit efficiency of conversion [29]. Gene silencing by DNA methylation, involving the pluripotency genes nanog and Oct4 which causes blockage in binding of transcription factors, has also been linked to causing interference in reprogramming [30]. Though the four most popular reprogramming factors have been Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, human iPSCs have also been derived using expression of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Lin28, indicating that pluripotent ground state becomes achievable through activation of different transcription factors [21]. The detailed derivation of iPSC along with the assay has been highlighted in Figure 2.",
        "The therapeutic potential of iPSC towards personalized cell therapy and disease modelling, has extended the functionality beyond laboratory tables as a research tool in murine and human models. Animal studies have identified promising potential of iPSC around treatment of genetic disorders, including sickle cell anemia; disease modelling of complex degenerative conditions like diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and the feasibility to be used in organ transplantation without risk of rejection and need of immunosuppression [14,31]. Few highlights on the therapeutic potential of iPSCs have been summarized in Table 2. The focus of the current review is to highlight and discuss the therapeutic roles of human iPSCs in different conditions and the future.",
        "Pluripotency and self-renewal are unique characteristics of iPSC that make them ideal for disease modelling and regenerative medicine. Their ability to indefinitely differentiate into cells of all the three germ layers makes them an important source for treating injuries as well as diseases. The availability of generating patient-specific iPSC with high efficiency and safety through protocols involving biochemical and epigenetic aspects expands the therapeutic potential of this tool. This can be assessed from the fact that a clinical trial involving iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons have been initiated for Parkinson’s disease after successful in vivo studies involving immunodeficient mice highlighted no risk of tumorigenicity [43]. Further, tissue resident macrophages, which are critical for immunity and derived from human-iPSCs, have been found to be immunologically different and better than the traditional monocyte-derived macrophages. Studies have shown human iPSC macrophages to restrict Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth in vitro by >75%, and were found to be capable of mounting antibacterial response when challenged with pathogens [44]. The greatest niche for iPSCs is the ability to generate the same from different donor categories including the diseased, and healthy making its application in the clinical setting at any stage a feasibility without the ethical issues around the ESCs.",
        "The fundamental use of iPSC in regenerative medicine remains undisputed, but the tumorigenic potential of residual undifferentiated stem cells necessitates the need to devise strategies to remove the same from differentiated cells. Different study reports multiple treatment methodologies for eliminating undifferentiated iPSCs and one such recent publication identified undifferentiated hiPSCs to be sensitive to treatment involving medium supplemented with high concentration of L-alanine [45]. Another study assessed the efficacy of plasma-activated medium (PAM) in eliminating undifferentiated hiSPCs through inducing oxidative stress. This study found PAM to selectively eliminate undifferentiated hiPSCs cocultured with normal human dermal fibroblasts, which were the differentiated cells. Lower expression of oxidative-stress related genes in the undifferentiated hiPSCs were found to be the underlying cause for PAM-selective cell death [46]. A recent study report describes the use of salicylic diamines to remove residual undifferentiated cells from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Salicylic diamines were found to exert their specific cytotoxic activity in the pluripotent stem cells by inhibiting the oxygen consumption rate. Teratoma formation was also found to be abolished in comparison to untreated cells [47].",
        "Non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, have emerged to be one of the leading causes for mortality in developed as well as developing nations. The trigger for myriad heart conditions exists both in genetics and the environment, which makes studying disease etiology in animal models complicated and inefficient. Animal model studies indicate up to 90% failure in new drug clinical trials, highlighting the limitation around prediction of safety and efficacy among humans. The iPSCs-based disease models have been studied for cardiac channelopathies including hereditary long QT syndrome (LQTS), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC); the endothelial cell disease including familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (FPAH); the smooth muscle cell condition including Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), and Marfan syndrome (MFS) [8].",
        "LQTS is an inherited fatal arrhythmia syndrome and around 17 genes have been associated with congenital LQTS, including the three main genes; KCNQ1 (LQT1), KCNH2 (LQT2), and SCN5A (LQT3), together which account for ~75% of clinically definite cases. The current therapeutic intervention includes β-blockers and a surgical procedure named left cardiac sympathetic denervation. Though genetic markers have been defined, the occurrence of variance of unknown significance (VUS) in 1 of 3 patients adds to the dilemma of inconclusive diagnosis. The need for better diagnostic platforms to assess outcome of genetic variants as well as different therapeutics led to the introduction of iPSCs. Many studies have worked to improve the differentiation efficiency, cellular maturation, and lineage specificity, develop new high-throughput assays for cellular phenotyping, and promote clinical implementation of patient-specific genetic models. A study by Wu J.C. et al. [48], utilized patient iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and devised various strategies to reduce heterogeneity. These include derivation of chamber-specific cardiomyocytes, cultivation for extended period, 3-dimensional and mechanical conditioning, rapid electric stimulation, and hormonal stimulation; use of multicellular preparations to reduce intercellular variability; and development of high-throughput cellular phenotyping using optogenetic sensors including genetically coded voltage and calcium indicators. Further, this study also established the utility of iPSC-CMs to distinguish between pathogenic and benign variants to improve diagnosis and management of LQTS using CRISPR genome editing. This study, using iPSC-CMs, also identified factors causative for prolonged QT including upregulation of genes; DLG2, KCNE4, PTRF, and HTR2C and downregulation of CAMKV gene. Thus iPSC-based model platforms aid in developing a better understanding around intractable clinical problems associated with diseases like LQTS.",
        "In case of DCM, characterized by ventricular chamber enlargement, and dilation as well as systolic dysfunction, human derived iPSCs have been used to investigate the excitation-contraction-coupling machinery, response to positive inotropic interventions, and study the proteome profile. This study utilized DCM patient specific-iPSC derived from skin fibroblasts and identified defects in assembly and maintenance of sarcomeric structure in the mutated iPSC-CM, as well as lower response to β-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol, and increased [Ca2+] out and angiotensin-II. This indicates mutated CM from DCM patients to express blunted inotropic response [49]. In case of HCM which is the most common cause of sudden death among the young, iPSC models have been used to identify pathogenesis of the condition. Once such study involving iPSC-CM derived from patients in a maternally inherited HCM family positive for the mitochondrial 16s rRNA gene (MT-RNR2) mutation m.2336T > C identified mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultrastructure defects among the carriers. Further, reduction in levels of mitochondrial proteins, the ATP/ADP ratio, and mitochondrial potential was also found. These lead to increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels, that becomes causative for HCM-specific electrophysiological abnormalities [50]. Recent studies have also generated peripheral blood mononuclear cells-derived iPSC from HCM patient positive for the myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) pathogenic mutation c.3369–3370 insC by the episomal method, which underwent successful differentiation to triblast cells with normal male karyotype, and expression of pluripotent markers indicating its usefulness as a tool to study HCM [51].",
        "The iPSC models around FPAH have identified modification of BMPR2 signaling causing reduced endothelial cell adhesion, migration, survival, as well as angiogenesis. The autosomal dominant BMPR2 disease causing mutation has been found to be only 20% penetrant and the use of iPSC identified increased BIRC3 to be related to improved survival, indicating the potential to use protective modifiers of FPAH for developing treatment strategies in the future [52]. The iPSC model around WBS with haploinsufficiency found deficiency of elastin and the patient-derived smooth muscle cell to be immature and highly proliferative with defects in function and contractile properties. The rescue was done by upregulating elastin signaling and use of anti-proliferative drug rapamycin [53]. In case of MFS, disease pathogenesis investigation using iPSCs identified defects in fibrillin-1 accumulation, degradation of extracellular matrix, abnormal activation of transforming growth factor-β, and cellular apoptosis [54].",
        "The iPSC technology is also largely viewed to promote pre-clinical drug trials and screening over animal models to overcome differences in electrophysiological properties between human and animal cardiomyocytes. Studies have shown patient-derived iPSCs to exhibit higher sensitivity towards cardiotoxic drugs that could be the cause for change in action potential and arrhythmia [55]. Studies which have analyzed the beat characteristics of 3D engineered cardiac tissues have proven the occurrence of physiologically relevant changes in cardiac contraction in response to increasing concentrations of drugs like verapamil (multi-ion channel blocker) and metoprolol (β-adrenergic antagonist) [56].",
        "Thus, iPSC has been successfully used to model and understand pathogenesis of different cardiac diseases, providing insights on pathways around progression as well as for assessment of drug toxicity. These highlight the potential to use iPSC-based models for precision medicine in clinical use.",
        "Theoretically iPSC has the potential to be programmed to form any cell in the human body, and coupled with improvements in reprogramming techniques, this technology has advanced our knowledge on disease pathology, developing precise therapeutics, as well as fuel advances in regenerative medicine [57]. In case of neurodegenerative conditions, and psychiatric disorders, the genetic predisposition and its relation to the disease pathophysiology is complex, and often there is alteration at structural as well as functional levels. In case of schizophrenia, which is aptly termed the “disease of the synapses”, studies have generated iPSC from family members positive for a frameshift mutation in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) and used gene editing to generate isogenic iPS cell lines. This study found depletion of DISC1 protein among the mutation carriers, along with dysregulation of genes associated with synapses and psychiatric disorders in the forebrain. This mutation causes deficit of synaptic vesicles among the iPS-cell derived forebrain neurons. This identification of transcriptional dysregulation in human neurons, highlights a new facet involving synaptic dysregulation in mental disorders [58]. The technology of stem cell therapy has also been used to restore the functionality in many degenerative conditions including that of the retina that leads to loss of vision. Studies have evaluated the use iPSC to overcome challenges posed by use of stem cell therapy. The proposed strategy revolves around transplantation of photoreceptors with or without the retinal pigment epithelium cells for treating retinal degradation, with minimal risk using iPSC [59].",
        "Degenerative disease generally progresses through multiple differentiation stages, and using iPSC models, these pathways of transition can be easily identified to assess cause as well as etiopathology better. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves loss of neurons from the spinal cord and motor cortex causing paralysis and death. The research around advancement of therapeutics, requires supply of human motor neurons positive for the causative genetic mutations that will also aid in understanding the root cause of motor neuron death. One study documented the production of iPS from ALS patient specific-skin fibroblasts from two sisters. Both were identified to be positive for the L144F (Leu144 → Phe) mutation of the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene that is associated with a slowly progressing form of ALS. This study found successful reprogramming to be possible with only four factors; KLF4, SOX2, OCT4, and c-MYC. Further, the severe disability state of the patients used for harvesting in this case did not seem to block the transformation process or efficiency [60]. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome and is a chromosomal instability disorder needing transplantation of hematopoietic grafts from HLA-identical sibling donors. The reduced quality of the hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow of the affected limits the benefit of gene therapy trials. Studies have worked upon formation of genetically corrected FA-specific iPSCs through non-hematopoietic somatic cells reprogramming to generate large number of genetically-stable autologous hematopoietic stem cells for treating bone marrow failure in FA. The reprogramming was done on dermal fibroblasts involving two rounds of infection with mouse-stem-cell-virus-based retrovirus encoding amino-terminal flag-tagged version of the four transcription factors; OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC. A batch of genetically corrected somatic cells using lentiviral vectors encoding FANCA or FANCD2 was also used for reprogramming to overcome the predisposition to apoptosis found in FA cells. The FANCA involved fibroblasts also underwent successful transformation to generate iPSCs. This study also found restoration of the FA pathway as a necessity to generate iPS from somatic cells of FA patients. The persistent FANCA expression in the FA-iPS cells indicated successful generation of genetically corrected FA-iPSCs with functional FA pathway, and disease-free status [61].",
        "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common chronic progressive disorder due to loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The pathophysiology of the disease is complex and research till date lacks complete understanding. Further, sporadic cases are not linked to any genetic variation. Development of patient-specific invitro iPSC models have been attempted to understand disease etiology better. Studies have worked upon generating iPSCs from sporadic cases of PD, which have been successfully reprogrammed to form dopaminergic neurons free of the reprogramming factors. This study utilized doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vectors that were excised with Cre-/lox-recombinase, resulting in generation of iPSC free of programming factors, and which retained all the pluripotent characteristics after removal of transgenes. This removal of promoter and transgene sequences from the vector reduced risk of oncogenic transformation and re-expression of the transduced transcription factors. This study highlighted the possibility of generating stable iPS-cell line in PD for better disease modelling [62]. Another study worked on improving the safety of human and non-human primate iPSC derived dopaminergic neurons for cell transplantation treatment in PD. This study found the protocol of NCAM(+)/CD29(low) sorting to result in enriching ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons from the pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cell populations. Further, these neurons also exhibited increased expression of FOXA2, LMX1A, TH, GIRK2, PITX3, EN1, and NURR1 mRNA. These neurons were also found to bear the potential to restore motor function among the 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats, 16 weeks after transplantation. Further, the primate iPSC-derived neural cell was found to have survived without any immunosuppression after one year of autologous transplant, highlighting the proof-of-concept around feasibility and safety of iPSC-derived transplantation for PD [10].",
        "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition involving destruction of the β-cells of the pancreas wherein transplantation with β-cells as islet tissues or the entire pancreas is suggested as an alternative over the traditional exogenous insulin supplementation. However, these come with risk of rejection, need of immunosuppression, apart from difficulty in the physiological control on blood glucose levels. To circumvent this block, generation of β-cells or islet tissues from human pluripotent stem cells like iPSCs has been attempted. Many studies have generated pancreatic β-like cells which secrete insulin in response to stimuli like potassium chloride [63]. However, co-excretion of glucagon, and somatostatin, apart from releasing unsuitable amounts of insulin; make these clinically inferior. iPSC-derived pancreatic endoderm cells have been shown to retain the potential to differentiate and are functionally comparable with adult β-cells. Further, the shortage of donor islet has been overcome using iPSCs, as pancreatic cells generated from these have been evaluated in clinical trials as a new source for transplantation therapy. The differentiation of iPSCs through mimicking the natural in vivo process was facilitated using a combination of growth factors including Nodal-activin, Wnt, retinoic acid, hedgehog, epidermal and fibroblast growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein, and Notch to activate as well as inhibit the key signaling pathway. This study thus highlighted the possibility of generating patient-specific fully functional pancreatic tissue for transplantation over donor islet for diabetes treatment [64].",
        "These studies highlight the development around iPSCs and transplantation technology for treatment of degenerative diseases as well as use them as disease models. The ability to generate patient-specific iPSC from skin biopsies, increases safety of autologous transplants without risk of immunorejection.",
        "The treatment for blood disorders involves need for mature red blood cells/erythrocytes from the bone marrow or umbilical cord blood, for blood transfusion, and is limited due to incompatibility in blood group and Rh antigens, and risk of infections [65]. Erythropoiesis is a complex process for generation of mature erythrocytes from the precursor erythroblasts that are difficult to culture in vitro, as the entire process occurs in the bone marrow mediated by complex interaction between cellular and extracellular environment involving hormones, cytokines, and growth factors [66]. Further, the fully differentiated red blood cells (RBCs) are not proliferative, and setting up a system for erythropoiesis-like maturation in precursor cells is a challenge. Further, recruitment of donors, need for rare blood group types, as well as safety in sensitive population groups, add to the roadblock [67]. Studies have investigated human pluripotent stem cells, including iPSCs as an alternative source for unlimited supply of functional erythrocytes. Studies have discussed different methods devised for RBC production, including using PSCs by repeating the developmental haematopoiesis; reprogramming somatic cells through transcription factors including OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC, KLF4, NANOG, LIN28; and stimulating the maturation of hematopoietic stem cells isolated from peripheral or umbilical cord blood [67,68]. The advantage of using iPSCs is their ability to differentiate into any cell type, and can be maintained indefinitely, thus becoming a potential source for cell replacement therapies. The potential of iPSc becomes highlighted by the fact that the French National Registry of People with a Rare Blood Phenotype/Genotype claims a single iPSc clone from their database could meet 73% of the needs of sickle cell disease patients [69]. This highlights that a limited number or RBC clones have the potential to supply to the majority needs of alloimmunized patients with rare blood groups.",
        "Studies have also worked on developing iPSC models for blood malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). A study worked on generating iPSC clones from bone marrow and blood of patients by integrating mutational analysis with cell programming to generate different iPSC clones which represent different disease stage as well as spectrum of the diseases including predisposition, low- and high-risk conditions. Additionally, the researchers also utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce as well as correct mutations in the iPSCs. This study found iPSC from AML patients upon differentiation exhibited the leukemic phenotype, and the derived hematopoietic stem cells contained two immunophenotypically distinct cell populations; an adherent and non-adherent fraction, wherein the adherent fraction cells continuously renewed and generated the non-adherent cells. The AML-iPSC thus generated was found to exhibit characteristics of the leukemia stem cell model thus becoming an efficient model for molecular analysis and studying key functional aspects to be utilized for developing better therapeutics [70]. In case of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the BCR-ABL gene fusion is the major disease driver, and treatment involves use of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), causing remission in the vast majority of the cases. Studies have shown the CML-iPSCs to not be affected by TKI even in presence of BCR-ABL expression, indicating absence of dependency in this state of differentiation. The CML-iPSCs factors essential for maintenance of BCR-ABL positive and iPSCs including phosphorylation of AKT, JNK, ERK1/2 remained unchanged while the expression of STAT5 and CRKL was decreased. Further, the hematopoietic cells derived from CML-iPSC regained TKI sensitivity thus facilitating understanding on the disease pathogenesis better [71,72]. In case of MDS, reprogramming to generate iPSCs has been done from patients with del7q mutation, which is the signature for the disease. The iPSCs with the mutation upon hematopoietic differentiation were found to generate low quantities of CD34+/CD45+ myeloid progenitor cells. Further, studying genetically engineered clones as well as the MDS-iPSC-del7q clone from the patient, the researchers functionally mapped MDS phenotype to regions 7q32.3–7q36.1, which is linked to loss of hematopoietic differentiation potential [73]. To highlight the efficiency of iPSC-technology in precision oncology, studies have also created isogenic iPSCs with del7q and mutation SRSF2 P95L, each of these connected to a specific phenotype and drug response [74].",
        "Human iPSC preclinical models also exist for monogenic blood disorders including thalassemia, and hemoglobinopathies for gene and cell therapy. Pilot trial investigations have explored the safety and effectiveness of mobilizing CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells in beta-thalassemia major adults. Further, the CD34+ were transduced with globin lentiviral vector, wherein the vector-encoded beta-chain was found to be expressed at normal hemizygous protein output levels in NSG mice. This trial thus validated an effective protocol for beta-globin gene transfer among thalassemia major CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells [75]. The risk of insertional mutagenesis using hematopoietic stem cells can be overcome through iPSCs which can be cloned and the clones with vector integration in the “safe harbor” sites become possible. The genomic safe harbors (GSHs) ensure that the inserted new genetic material functions as predicted, and do not cause any alterations to the host genome [76]. Studies have shown the use of gene editing tools in case of beta-thalassemia to not be successful in expression of beta-globin in the corrected locus, because of the developmental immaturity of the iPSCs. In such cases, insertion of globin gene copy in the GSH site like AAVS1 has been recommended as an alternative approach [77]. Human iPSC models for gene therapy have also been developed and studied for primary immunodeficiency syndromes, including chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) caused by mutations in genes which code for the phagocyte NADPH oxidase that produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that kill bacteria. Studies have shown genetically corrected CGD-iPSCs from macrophages and neutrophils using CRISPR/Cas9 system in the single intronic mutation of the CYBB gene to exhibit antimicrobial activity through generation of ROS and phagocytosis [78].",
        "Thus, the potential of iPSCs to study etiology of complex diseases which manifest late in life, as well as to identify markers for precision therapeutics, is worth exploring in the arena of clinical biomedical research. Human iPSC-based models are a true success in our understanding of disease pathogenesis away from the animal models.",
        "Organ donations are a key clinical need to treat end-stage organ failure conditions, and in often cases, patients are left to fight the acute shortage for the same. This apart, from identifying HLA-matched donors, handling risk of infections and rejection, as well as life-long immunosuppression, to a great extent damages quality of life for the affected as well as leads to loss of crucial time. Human iPSCs are being evaluated as a potential source for generating organs that can overcome roadblocks of shortage as well as risk of rejection. Studies have explored the possibility of generating a three-dimensional vascularized and functional liver organ from human iPSCs [79,80,81]. Generation of hepatocyte-like cells using iPSC technology has been reviewed to be fundamentally beneficial for treatment of severe liver disease, screening for drug toxicities, in liver transplantation, as well as to facilitate basic research [21]. Liver organogenesis involves delamination of specific hepatic cells from the foregut endodermal sheet to form a liver bud, which is then vascularized. One study prepared hepatic endoderm cells from human iPSCs through direct differentiation, wherein 80% of the treated cells were found to be positive for the cell fate determining hepatic marker; HNF4A. Further, to stimulate early organogenesis, the iPSCs were cocultured with stromal cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and human mesenchymal stem cells, and after 48h of seeding, the human iPSCs were found to be self-organized into three-dimensional cell clusters visible macroscopically. This iPSC-derived liver bud, when further assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarray assay for expression analysis, highlighted the pattern to be similar to human fetal liver cell-derived liver buds. Hemodynamic stimulation to form organ was done by cranial window model, and the iPSC-derived tissue was found to perform liver-specific functions including protein synthesis and human-drug specific metabolism actions. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential to use organ-bud transplantation for organ regeneration [82]. Figure 3 highlights the process of liver development and hepatic differentiation from hiPSCs.",
        "Hepatocytes represent 80% of the liver mass and are the specialized epithelial cells crucial for maintaining homeostasis. The hepatic differentiation involves induction of endoderm differentiation by activin A, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), and such generated hepatocytes have been found to retain features of human liver including lipid and glycogen storage, urea synthesis, etc. Cholangiocytes in the inner space of the bile duct tree have also been generated from the common progenitor hepatoblast, through downregulation of signaling factors including epidermal growth factor (EGF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), Jagged 1, sodium taurocholate, and the generated cholangiocytes have been detected to express mature markers including SOX9 (SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9), OPN (Osteopontin), CK7 (Cytokeratin 7), CK19 (Cytokeratin 19), etc. The kupffer cells are the largest population of resident macrophages in the human body and also facilitate liver regeneration after an ischemic injury. Studies have demonstrated generation of iPSC-derived kupffer cells from macrophage precursors by adding a hepatic stimulus [83,84].",
        "Another study evaluated lung regeneration by endogenous and exogenous stem cell mediated therapeutic approaches. Physiologically the tissue turnover rate in lung is slow and any insult to the regeneration process can lead to development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Bone marrow stem cells, embryonic stem cells, as well as iPSCs have shown excellent regenerative capacity to repair injured lung by generating whole lung in the lab using de-cellularized tissue scaffold and stem cells [85]. Lung organogenesis involves proximodistal patterning, branching morphogenesis, alveolarization, and cellular differentiation [86]. A study by Mou et al. [87], described generation of multipotent lung and airway progenitors from mouse ESCs and patient-specific cystic fibrosis (CF) iPSCs. The definitive endoderm from mouse ESCs were converted to foregut endoderm and then into replicating lung endoderm+Nkx2.1 (earliest marker of lung endoderm), which further transformed to a multipotent embryonic lung progenitor and airway progenitor cells. This study further highlighted that precise timing of the BMP, WNT, FGF signaling pathways are crucial for induction of NKX2.1. This study also utilized the same strategy to develop disease-specific lung progenitor cells from CF-iPSCs to make a model platform to study lung diseases. Further, the disease-specific lung progenitors were also engrafted in immunodeficient mice. One study derived lung progenitor cells with ~80% efficiency from iPSCs which differentiated onto alveolar epithelium both in vitro and in vivo. This study used Activin/BMP-4/bFGF treatment to obtain definitive endoderm from iPSC, which was further exposed to a series of pathway inhibitors (BMP, TGF-β, WNT), followed by longer exposure to FGF-19, KGF, BMP-4 and a small molecule CHIR99021 to mimic Wnt pathway to generate anterior foregut endoderm. The generated lung progenitors were further differentiated to many pulmonary progenitor cells including basal cells, goblet cells, ciliated cells, in vitro as well as in immunodeficient mice [88].",
        "Studies have also utilized iPSC-derived organ models to study pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). One study established a screening strategy to identify drugs that reduce angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) using human ESCs-derived cardiac cells and lung organoids, as the infection occurs due to binding of the virus to ACE2 on the cell membrane. Target analysis revealed treatment with antiandrogenic drugs to reduce ACE2 expression, thus protecting the lung organoids from the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical studies on COVID-19 identified patients with prostate disease, with elevated levels of circulating androgen to pose increased risk for high disease severity [89]. Another study utilized human lung stem-cell based alveolospheres to generate insights on SARS-CoV-2 mediated interferon response and pneumocyte dysfunction. This study described a chemically defined modular alveolosphere culture system for propagation and differentiation of the human alveolar type 2 (AT2) derived from primary lung tissue. The cultured cells were found to express ACE2 and transcriptome analysis of the infected alveolospheres were found to mirror features of the COVID-19 infected human lung, together with the interferon-mediated inflammatory response, loss of surfactant proteins, and apoptosis. Further, infected alveolospheres when treated with low dose interferons, a reduction in viral replication was noted. Thus, human stem-cell based models have also added insight to COVID-19 pathogenesis [90]. In case of use of iPSC three-dimensional model, a study by Huang et al. [91] found the derived AT2 to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 with decreased expression of surfactant proteins, and cell death, exhibiting delayed type I interferon response with multiplicities of infection of 5 and interferon-stimulated genes. Another study assessed inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection using lung and colonic organoids from the gut. The derived iPSCs in three-dimensional, were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In case of immune response, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) signatures were noted after 24 h with multiplicities of infection of 0.1. This study also screened US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved entry inhibitors including imatinib, mycophenolic acid, and quinacrine dihydrochloride; wherein treatment at physiologically relevant levels highlighted inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection both in iPSC-lung organoids and colonoids, indicating that iPSC models also prove to be a valuable source for safe drug screening [92].",
        "Development of organ-specific progenitor cells which progress into the complete three-dimensional organ in a lab highlights the potential of iPSCs in regenerative medicine. Further, the impact of organ-system models to study infection pathology, highlights the wide clinical arena in which iPSC-technology can be used.",
        "The iPSCs have been generated for modelling pathogenesis of many diseases, and one of the most notable additions to the same is cancer, including models for familial cancer syndromes. One such study reports on the successful establishment of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) patient-derived iPSC to study role of p53 in development of osteosarcoma. LFS being a heterogenous cancer condition, osteosarcoma is one of the types wherein relevance of germline p53 mutations have been highly reported. The pre-existing murine LFS models have been insufficient in charting the entire tumor landscape and patient-derived iPSCs in this regard have demonstrated the feasibility to effectively study human cancer syndromes. Studies have found the LFS-derived mesenchymal stem cells to exhibit low expression of targets of p53 including p21 and MDM2; highlighting their ability to retain the defective p53 function from the parental fibroblasts. Further, p53 knockdown was found to cause upregulation of osteogenic markers in LFS osteoblasts, and the possibility to attain osteosarcoma-related phenotypes in LFS iPSC-derived osteoblasts was found. Further, gene expression analysis in LFS-derived osteoblasts was found to correlate with poor patient survival, and decreased time for recurrence. The impaired H19 restoration was also found to repress tumorigenic potential [36]. Another study involving modelling of osteosarcoma from LFS derived-iPSC identified the LFS osteoblasts to recapitulate oncogenic properties of osteosarcoma proving to be an excellent model to study disease pathogenesis [93]. In case of Noonan syndrome (NS) characterized by germline PTPN11 mutations, studies which have derived hiPSCs from hematopoietic cells and which harbor the PTPN11 mutations were found to successfully recapitulate features of NS. The iPSC-derived NS myeloid cells were found to exhibit increased STAT5 signaling and enhanced expression of micro-RNAs viz. miR-223 and miR-15a. Further, reducing miR-223 function was found to normalize myelogenesis, highlighting the role of micro-RNA dysregulation in early oncogenesis [94]. Human iPSC-derived hereditary cancer models have also aided in identifying BRCA1-deleted tumor niche to be the cause for disease progression [95].",
        "The iPSC models around cancer aid in overcoming the hurdles posed by traditional cancer cell line systems, which may lose the characteristics of the original tumor with time, and further harnessing primary cancer cells at different stages of carcinogenesis is not feasible. The established iPSC reprogramming strategies can aid in differentiation of cancer cells to target cell lineages which can aid in studying each of the different stages in cancer progression [96]. The iPSCs developed from primary tumors, as well as cancer cell lines are invaluable tools to study genetic alterations early-on in familial cancer syndromes which is crucial in understand disease pathogenesis. Apart from cancer cell lines, patient-derived xenograft models have also been proven to be efficacious for understanding tumor heterogeneity, genetic alterations, and testing efficacy of cytotoxic drugs. However, the need for successful engraftment, technical challenges, and variable growth rates, are the key limitations. Even in case of animal models, high rate of mortality, and absence of metastasis are the limitations [97,98,99]. Advancements in iPSC models have also led researchers to be able to design autologous iPSC-based vaccine which presents a broad spectrum of tumor antigens to the immune system of the mice, and also found success in eliciting a prophylactic reaction against multiple cancer types. These studies highlight the great promise iPSC-based autologous vaccines present towards cancer prevention as well as therapy [100].",
        "The iPSCs plug the very fundamental requirement for advancing scientific and clinical research by aiding insight into the fundamental growth and regenerative processes that happen early-on in life. They have emerged as an efficient alternative to ESC in clinical settings especially for screening new pharmaceutical compounds. The ability to produce patient-specific iPSCs has made studying disease pathogenesis and experiments around treating and managing inherited disease conditions, a close reality. They provide an unlimited repertoire of highly differentiated cells from focus area, fueling multiple investigations without roadblock on availability. The fact that iPSCs have also demonstrated success in treating few conditions including substantial correction of SCA and FA, highlights their therapeutic potential [101]. With organ engineering, using patient-specific iPSCs, the possibility to produce animal-free meat are also few areas which are being rapidly explored. The areas where iPSCs have proven impact on investigations as well as therapeutics highlights the potential of the instrument in various fields of biomedicine. Research around safe application and minimizing involvement of animal cells is crucial to enhance usability factor among humans. The ability to generate and use iPSCs derived from large animals (e.g., non-human primates, swine, horses, sheep, and canines), being highly similar and homogenous to the human microenvironment, is currently made available along with simultaneous generation of resources for improvement of animal welfare.",
        "Scientific and technological advancements have also aided in designing high throughput drug screening systems based on hiPSC stem cell-derived atrial myocytes for detecting cardiac toxicity in atrial arrhythmias. The platform established by human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes was found to be useful in detecting propensity for drug-induced tachyarrhythmias [102]. The potential of iPSCs have also empowered COVID-19 studies wherein iPSC-derived airway epithelial cells were successfully developed to models consisting of cell types found in human upper airway epithelium. Further, the cells were found to secrete mucus and also exhibited positive for infection with COVID-19. The infected model also exhibited cytokine production at levels similar to a human infected body. This study highlights the significance of upper respiratory airway models in studying respiratory viral infections [103].",
        "Although the impressive prospects of iPSC in clinical settings have been proven, the challenges that need to be realized and worked upon include tumorigenicity, heterogeneity, and immunogenicity. Teratoma formation continues to be serious challenge and a limiting factor in hiPSC transplantation. Though there are multiple elimination methods including cell sorting systems, antibody conjugates, the risk of tumor arising from proliferating progeny still exists. These apart, the reprogramming factors, and occurrence of genetic alterations during in vitro culturing also add to risk of tumorigenicity. Immunogenicity characterized by rejection especially in allograft transplantation deems the need to use immunosuppressants. Heterogeneity has also been reported as a limitation in iPSC which to a great extent is an outcome of genetics and differences in gene expression [104]. Apart from these, studies have also noted variability and reproducibility of results across multiple laboratories as a drawback. Different reprogramming methods, chromosomal instability, can impact the phenotype of the generated iPSC. Further, many protocols described and published today to a great extent result in formation of immature iPSCs and the existing advancements for inducing phenotype-specific maturation has been recorded to involve few months. Further, the need for broad range of iPSCs with respect to disease as well as cohort used for iPSC generation is a need [105].",
        "Induced pluripotent stem cells are also now being investigated in clinical trials for diseases and one such involves the Hirschsprung disease initiated in the year 2020. This case-control involves use of patient-derived iPSCs to develop models of the disease to understand genetic factors contributing to disease pathogenesis [106]. The global distribution of clinical studies indicates United States of America (USA) to be leading in the numbers at 36%, followed by France and China at 15%, and 12% respectively. Further, in case of interventional studies involving re-transplantation of the generated iPSCs into humans, China was found to be leading at 36.7%, while records find USA to have 16.7%. In case of target disease conditions being investigated, ophthalmic diseases ranked highest at 24.4%, followed by non-communicable ailments at 22.1%, cardiovascular diseases at 14.5%, and neurological diseases at 13% [107]. Few clinical trials involving ESCs/iPSCs have been listed in Table 3.",
        "Human iPSCs have become a powerful tool in basic as well as translational and clinical research because of their ability to be maintained indefinitely whilst preserving the genetic makeup of the host. Further, technological advancements which enable genetic manipulation of iPSCs, ensure they become a rich repertoire for cell replacement therapy. Identification of GSH regions further adds to the feasibility to reduce risk of transplantation to a great extent. Their ability to provide cell-specific information, makes studying interaction between genetics, epigenetics, as well as extracellular environment a possibility. Complex relationships involving multiple cell types becomes dissectible with iPSC-models, and their ability to harbor large chromosomal alterations as well as deletions, makes them a favorable model for cancer studies. Though highly researched upon, the technological advancements to decipher the impact of genetic and epigenetic alterations as well as variability in cell clones or colonies is still naïve. Moreover, development of engraftable cell lines need to be devised considering the safety and efficacy aspect.",

        "Cartilage is a semi-rigid, load-bearing, avascular connective tissue, formed solely by cells known as chondrocytes. These cells are loosely embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM) composed predominantly of collagens and, in some cases, elastic fibers, hyaluronan and proteoglycans [1]. Cartilage formation, also known as chondrogenesis, is a dynamic cellular process of a condensed mesenchyme tissue derived from the mesoderm germ layer during embryogenesis. Cartilage represents the fetal precursor tissue for skeletal development. In adults, it persists at almost all joints between bones and in structures that must be deformable as well as strong such as in the respiratory system. Based on the structure and composition of their ECMs, chondrocytes form three different types of cartilage; namely, hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage and elastic cartilage [2].",
        "Cartilage exhibits diverse clinical aspects and relevance to various medical disciplines, including orthopedics, rheumatology, and respiratory medicine. Cartilage defects are associated with various clinical conditions such as osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis, and cartilage dysplasias [1]. Understanding the clinical significance of cartilage is critical for the development of effective therapeutics and interventions in various healthcare settings. Orthopedic surgeries such as joint arthroplasty and cartilage transplantation are the most commonly used therapeutic interventions for cartilage repair or replacement [3]. However, these surgical interventions are invasive or minimally invasive, and their ability to restore normal joint function, alleviate pain, and improve the quality of life for individuals with cartilage-related issues is limited.",
        "Therefore, it is crucial to develop other non-invasive therapeutic approaches with high safety and efficacy. Theoretically and due to their ability to repair injured tissues, adult stem cells can be a good source for developing therapies for a large number of diseases [4]. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) which can be derived from various tissues such as bone marrow, adipose tissu, placenta, umbilical cord blood, and multiple dental tissues, are multipotent cells that have the potential to differentiate into the mesenchymal lineages including osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes, as well as other non-mesenchymal lineages, such as cardiomyocytes, astrocytes, neural cells, and endothelial cells [5, 6]. Therefore, extensive efforts have been spent to develop MSCs-based cell therapies for a broad spectrum of diseases, encompassing cartilage and bone diseases, hematological diseases, inflammatory diseases, and graft-versus-host disease [7]. It is important to note that different transcription factors regulate the differentiation of MSCs to different lineages. Chondrogenic differentiation is determined by members the SOX (sex determining region Y (SRY)-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors SOX9, SOX5, and SOX6 while regulation of osteoblast differentiation involve the transcription factors runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osterix, and β-catenin [8, 9]. Among the different sources of MSCs, bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) are the most commonly used MSCs in regenerative medicine, particularly for cartilage and bone regeneration [10]. Although significant strides have been taken to improve the chondrogenic differentiation from BM-MSCs and other cell sources, several obstacles persist complicating the achievement of consistent and effective chondrocytes required for clinical application [11]. Several factors may lead to the failure of utilizing BM-MSCs for efficient treatment of cartilage diseases including but not limited to the restricted proliferation capabilities in cultures [12], donor variations, and immunogenicity triggered during culture and cryopreservation [13].",
        "These challenges could be addressed by the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. iPSCs are pluripoent cells which have the capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into almost all cell types [14]. The concept of self-renewal is the ability of the cells to undergo infinite cell divisions without differentiation into other cell types, while pluripotency is the ability of the cells to produce specialized cells of the three embryonic layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm [15]. iPSCs can be generated from any type of cells through non-integrating reprogramming method using specific transcription factors known as Yamanaka factors namely, Octamer binding transcription factor 3/4 (OCT3/4), SOX2, Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), and Cellular-Myelocytomatosis c-MYC [15]. Simplicity and reproducibility are the attractive features of the iPSC technology and have attracted the biomedical scientists to generate and differentiate iPSCs from numerous normal and disease-specific cell types for disease modeling and drug screening applications [16]. Syngeneic non-integrated iPSCs and their derivatives have no or minimal immunogenic effect supporting the notion that these cells could be used for cellular therapy without causing harmful immune responses [17]. Therefore, generation of iPSC-derived chondrocytes has become indispensable to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of cartilage-related disorders and represents an important avenue in regenerative medicine. In the following section, we will summarize different strategies developed to differentiate iPSCs into chondrocytes aiming to recapitulate the in vivo microenvironment that support chondrogenesis, and to generate functional and stable iPSC-derived chondrocytes.",
        "Chondrocytes can be differentiated from iPSCs though different intermediate stages, such as iPSC-derived MSCs (iPSC-MSCs), embryoid bodies (EBs) formation, induction of neural crest cells (NCCs), and primitive streak-mesendoderm and mesodermal lineage. iPSC-MSCs are morphologically highly similar to BM-MSCs and their gene expression profiling is also comparable to that of BM-MSCs [18], and exhibit traits that encompass features of both iPSCs and MSCs. iPSC-MSCs show reduced immunogenicity as compared to iPSCs [19], which renders them appropriate for allogeneic transplantation and enables development of off-the-shelf therapies. Moreover, patient-specific iPSC-MSCs open up the potential for developing personalized medicine for autologous transplantation, in vitro disease modeling, and drug screening [20]. These iPSC-MSCs were reported to differentiate into chondrocytes with growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-β3) (Fig. 1A). Another commonly used approach to obtain chondrocytes from iPSCs in vitro is through formation of three-dimensional (3D) aggregates of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) known as embryoid bodies (EBs) (Fig. 1B). The EB has the capacity to generate ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal cells due to its initiation of a process that resembles gastrulation-like events in embryonic development [21]. Several protocols have been developed under this category with slight variations in the number and concentration of growth factors used, the number of days required and whether an additional step such as differentiation of EBs to MSCs or paraxial mesoderm cells, is needed to differentiate iPSCs to chondrocytes [22]. NCCs are a multipotent group of transient embryonic cells in the vertebrate. They are derived from the ectoderm and differentiate to the peripheral nervous system cells and several non-neural cell types including pigment cells, and the cranio-facial cartilage and bones [23]. Taking the advantage of being multipotent, chondrogenic cells could be differentiated from the NCC-derived MSCs [24] (Fig. 1C). Chondrocytes were also reported to be differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) through primitive streak or mesendoderm to mesoderm [25]. Cheng et al. followed this method to differentiate iPSCs to chondrocyte in three short stages using different combination of growth factors in each stage [26] (Fig. 1D). iPSCs can also be differentiated to chondrocytes by co-culture with primary chondrocytes (Fig. 1D). This method is based on the fact that the primary chondrocytes secret paracrine factors which may induce chondrogenic differentiation of the stem cells by closely mimicking the in vivo tissue microenvironment for chondrogenesis [27]. Moreover, co-culture permits crosstalk between the stem cells and the primary chondrocytes influencing chondrocyte development. It facilitates physical contact between different cell types which stabilizes the cellular phenotype and allows for communication of molecular signals involved in chondrogenic differentiation [28].Fig. 1Schematic representation of the current strategies for in vitro differentiation of iPSCs to chondrocytes.

        "The above-mentioned studies showed that cartilage cells differentiated from human iPSCs represent a promising tool for regenerative medicine to treat cartilage-related diseases, however some challenges remain. The variability in the quality and characteristics of different iPSC lines affects the efficiency and consistency of chondrogenic differentiation [29]. Since the suspension culture promotes the chondrogenic differentiation and enables removal of non-chondrocytic cells, Yamashita and colleagues reported that homogenous chondrogenic nodules derived from iPSCs cultivated in suspension culture has the potential to form scaffold-free hyaline cartilage in animal models [30]. How to generate homogenous cartilage cells without formation of hypertrophic chondrocytes which have the potential to trigger the process of initiating endochondral ossification in vivo remains the main challenge. Moreover, iPSCs have the potential to form teratomas, therefore it is crucial to ensure complete elimination of undifferentiated iPSCs from chondrogenic cultures to prevent teratoma formation upon transplantation [31]. Obtaining fully mature chondrocytes from iPSCs with a phenotype comparable to native chondrocytes, is challenging [32]. In addition, undesired development of chondrogenic hypertrophy and fibrocartilage in vitro may require modification of the growth factors cocktail used [33]. Due to bovine xenoproteins, use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in cell culture may induce adverse response in transplant patient upon injection of MSCs [34]. Additionally, there is a risk of infection because of viral and prion contamination [35]. Interestingly, MSC induction in xeno-free conditions may tackle these problems and promote the safety and efficiency of iPSC-MSCs for clinical applications [36].",
        "In the last decade, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR-Cas9) approach has become an efficient and indispensable tool in biomedical research, and has been extensively explored in bone and cartilage research [37, 38]. It has been used to edit genes associated with chondrogenic differentiation to enhance their expression [39] or to modify signaling pathways involved in chondrogenesis [40]. For example, chondrogenesis can be regulated by the expression of SOX9 and Stat3 [39]. Chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs can be promoted by knocking down the RUNX2, a key transcription factor associated with osteoblast differentiation [41]. Genomic editing in iPSC-derived chondrocytes has been also reported in disease modeling. Efficient editing of cartilage related genes enables to investigate in depth the mechanisms underlying cartilage disorders and to identify potential therapeutic agents [42]. An interesting genome editing study showed simultaneous SOX9 activation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) repression in rat BM-MSCs, which promoted chondrocytes differentiation and regeneration of calvarial bone [43]. Various studies have investigated diverse targets for regeneration, paving the way for potential clinical trials in the near future. Genome editing has been employed to boost the regenerative potential of chondrocytes. This may involve editing genes related to ECM production, cell proliferation, or resistance to hypertrophy [41, 44, 45]. Although numerous studies have been reported on the application of genome-edited chondrocytes for in vivo cartilage repair, drug screening, and disease modeling [39, 41, 43], relatively few studies have been conducted specifically on iPSC-derived chondrocytes [40, 46, 47]. It was revealed that mutations in TRPV4 disrupted the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway in iPSC-derived chondrocytes and blocked formation of hypertrophic chondrocytes providing potential targets for drug development for TRPV4-associated skeletal dysplasias [48]. The existing methods for chondrogenic differentiation from iPSCs may generate heterogeneous cell populations. To resolve this problem, a collagen, type II, alpha 1- green fluorescent protein (COL2A1-GFP) knock-in reporter allele generated by CRISPR-Cas9 system was used to purify the cells. The purified chondroprogenitors exhibited enhanced chondrogenic potential in comparison to unselected groups [40].",
        "Transplantation of allogeneic human iPSC-derived cartilage have shown to be more effective than allogeneic BM-MSC-derived cartilage [49]. However, these cartilage cells can trigger immunological reactions [50]. To overcome this issue, it is necessary to reduce the immunological reactions. The β2 microglobulin, a component of MHC class I molecules, was knocked down in monkey iPSCs before their differentiation into chondrocytes. As expected, the allogeneic iPSC-derived cartilage transplanted in osteochondral defects in monkey knee joints showed increased proliferation of natural killer cells and leukocytes surrounding the knocked down PSC-derived cartilage. This indicates the intricate processes in the immune response of the transplanted allogeneic cartilage in osteochondral defects in vivo [47]. These studies highlight the tremendous advantages of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in understanding the pathogenesis, identification of promising drug targets, and development of feasible treatment interventions for cartilage diseases.",
        "iPSC-derived cartilage organoids are 3D cell clusters that are created by differentiation of iPSCs in vitro. To support formation of cartilage organoids and their ability to self-renewal and self-organization, a number of biocompatible materials are used, such as Matrigel and synthetic hydrogels [51]. Cartilage organoid technology has been developed to facilitate drug screening through identification of important signaling pathways, recapitulate joint developmental events during embryogenesis and cartilage regeneration. Li and colleagues showed that long-term culturing of hiPSC-derived multi-tissue organoids (MTOs) in E8 medium results in a spontaneous emergence of hyaline cartilage tissues. Moreover, a transcriptome analysis indicated a strong association between the expression of chondrogenic markers in MTOs and fetal lower limb chondrocytes [52]. Another intriguing research demonstrated that subcutaneous implantation of iPSC-derived cartilage microtissues combined with pre-hypertrophic cartilage organoids in nude mice results in formation of both cartilaginous and bony regions [53]. Similarly, O’Connor and colleagues established osteochondral organoids using murine iPSCs through time-dependent sequential exposure of TGF-β3 and BMP2, to mimic natural bone development through the process of endochondral ossification. The generated organoids showed dual tissues consisting of cartilaginous and calcified bony regions [54]. A recent study showed a sequential differentiation process to produce matrix-rich cartilage spheroids from iPSC-MSCs by inducing NCCs in xeno-free environments. Efficient chondrogenic differentiation was induced by a thienoindazole derivative, TD-198946, a small molecule used to enhance differentiation of various human progenitor cells to chondrocytes. No hypertrophy, fibrotic cartilage formation, or dedifferentiation detected in vivo in the generated cartilage spheroids. These chondrogenic spheroids can serve as building blocks for biofabrication of engineered cartilage tissues, as they have the ability to fuse within a short timeframe of a few days [24]. It is worth mentioning that iPSC-derived cartilage organoids have also been reported to recruit osteogenic precursors for bone repair [55]. A recent study has revealed that allogeneic iPSC-derived cartilage organoids transplanted in the knee joints of a primate model of chondral defects integrated with articular cartilage of the host and prevented further degeneration of the surrounding cartilage [49]. These findings open new horizons for development of complex tissue engineered implants to promote zone-specific functionality by using pre-differentiated organoids as building blocks to establish articular cartilage grafts. Even though the research on iPSC-derived cartilage organoids is still in its infancy and creating fully functional cartilage organoids is still challenging, it is evident that they have demonstrated promising applications in drug screening, disease modeling, regeneration, and repair. It is of note that application of 3D bioprinting technology in development of iPSC-derived cartilage organoids can create more complex cartilage organoids and heighten their structural organization [56].",
        "iPSC-derived chondrocytes have been utilized to recapitulate cartilage injuries and diseases in vitro (Table 1). The pluripotency and unlimited self-renewal capacity of the iPSCs make these cells vitally important for disease modeling, which permit us to investigate the mechanisms of various diseases, screen for potential treatment targets, and test therapeutic agents [57]. iPSC-derived disease models for both monogenic and complex cartilage diseases have been developed with more focus on single gene cartilage disorders [58]. Saitta et al. established an iPSC-based in vitro model of skeletal dysplasia to investigate the initial stages of abnormal cartilage formation. Mutations in the calcium channel gene TRPV4 lead to abnormal chondrogenesis during cartilage growth plate differentiation [59]. Isogenic iPSCs with wild-type or mutant NLRP3 have been generated from patients with neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease. Both in vitro and in vivo chondrogenic differentiation were performed. Furthermore, immunodeficient mice that received mutant cartilaginous pellets in vivo experienced disordered endochondral ossification [60]. In vitro models of familial osteochondritis dissecans (FOCD) was developed using both patient BM-MSCs and iPSCs derived from patient fibroblasts to delineate the pathogenesis of this disease. The results showed that chondrogenic pellets with a high glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content but a poor structural integrity. Moreover, dysregulation of matrix production and assembly was evident. These findings show that how studying FOCD iPSC-derived chondrocytes can reveal insights into disease phenotype and pathogenesis offering a new in vitro model of OA and cartilage degeneration [61]. Esseltine et al. [62] converted fibroblasts from patient with oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) into iPSCs, which provided a useful model for investigation of this disease. In this study, the iPSCs showed mutated Cx43 gene, decreased levels of Cx43 mRNA and protein, resulting in impaired channel function. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of Cx43 changed during the chondrogenic differentiation of ODDD-derived iPSCs. This altered localization may have contributed to the more compact cartilage pellet morphology observed in differentiated ODDD-derived iPSCs. Additionally, other research teams successfully developed iPSC-derived disease models for other genetic and complex multifactorial skeletal disorders including type II collagenopathy, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive (FOP), OA, hand OA, and early-onset finger OA (efOA) [58]. Recently, a novel method was introduced to direct iPSC-derived sclerotome through a sequential transformation in a 3D pellet culture. The generated chondroprogenitors can further be differentiated into articular chondrocytes or, alternatively, transformed into hypertrophic chondrocytes capable of transitioning into osteoblasts. Moreover, distinctive gene expression signatures have been identified at critical developmental stages, highlighting the effectiveness of this system in modeling genetic disorders affecting cartilage and bone [63]. In general, these studies demonstrated that normal chondrogenesis can be recapitulated using an iPSC-derived model, and disease-specific iPSCs exhibit molecular evidence of aberrant chondrogenic developmental processes. These findings may be utilized to develop therapeutic strategies for cartilage-related disorders.Table 1Cartilage-related preclinical studies using iPSC-MSCs and chondrocytesCondition(s)Cell type(s)Intermediate(s)Chondrocyte cultivationApplication(s)ReferencesYeariPSC-derived chondrocytesCartilage diseasesRVR COL2A1-GFP knock-in iPSC line and BJFF.6 iPSC lineMesodermal cellsPellet cultureRegenerative medicineDicks et al.[46]2020Disease modelingHand osteoarthritis (HOA)hiPSCs derived from patient’s dermal fibroblastsEBsMicromass cultureDisease modelingCastro-Viñuelas et al.[104]2020Osteochondral defectsCBMC-derived iPSC linesEBsPellet cultureRegenerative medicineRim et al.[105]2020Osteoarthritis (OA)iPSC line derived from NHEKsMSCsMicromass cultureRegenerative medicineChang et al.[72]2020Achondroplasia (ACH)hiPSCs derived from patient’s dermal fibroblastsMesodermal cellsSuspension cultureDrug discoveryOzaki et al.[106]2020Early-onset finger osteoarthritis (efOA)hiPSCs derived from patient’s dermal fibroblastsEBsPellet cultureDisease modelingRim et al.[107]2021Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) and metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS)iPSCs derived from patients’ dermal fibroblasts and PBMCsMesodermal cellsSuspension cultureDisease modelingPretemer et al.[108]2021Drug discoveryAchondroplasia (ACH)hiPSCs derived from dermal fibroblastsEBsSuspension cultureDrug discoveryKimura et al.[109]2021Chondoral defecthiPSC line (414C2)NCCs, MSCsPellet cultureRegenerative medicineNakamura et al.[64]2021Osteochondral defectCBMC-derived iPSC linesEBsPellet cultureRegenerative medicineLee et al.[110]2021Osteochondral defectMouse gingiva-derived iPSCs–Pellet cultureModeling skeletal developmentZhang et al.[65]2022Disease modelingDrug discoveryGenetic cartilage and bone disordershiPSC linesParaxial mesoderm-derived sclerotomePellet cultureModeling skeletal developmentLamandé et al.[63]2023Disease modelingDrug discoveryArticular cartilage defectCynomolgus monkey iPSC line (1466A1)Mesodermal cellsSuspension cultureRegenerative medicineAbe et al.[49]2023iPSC-derived MSCsIntervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD)hiPSsMSCs–Regenerative medicineSun et al.[79]2021Cartilage defectshiPSCsNCCs, MSCsSpheroid cultureRegenerative medicineZujur et al.[24]20232D: two dimentional; 3D: three dimentional; ACH: achondroplasia; BM-MSCs: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells; CBMC: umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell; COL2A1: collagen, type II, alpha 1; CS: chitosan; EBs: embryoid bodies; efOA: early-onset finger osteoarthritis; FOP: fibrodysplasia ossficans progressive; GFP: green fluorescent protein; hESCs: human embryonic stem cells; hiPSCs: human induced pluripotent stem cells; HOA: hand osteoarthritis; IVDD: intervertebral disc degeneration; MCDS: metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid; MED: multiple epiphyseal dysplasia; MSCs: mesenchymal stem cells; NCC: neural crest cell; NHEK: Normal human epidermal keratinocytes; OA: osteoarthritis; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cell; TD: thanatophoric dysplasia",

        "To overcome some limitations of scaffold-based 3D cell culture method, scaffold-free methods showed promising results as well. Nakumora et al. [64] reported efficient fabrication of unified, self-sufficient, and functional cartilaginous constructs by combining iPSCs and bio-3D printers using a Kenzan needle array technology. This approach may facilitate repairing of articular cartilage defects. Zhang et al. [65] established a rapid and efficient approach, employing a 3D rotary suspension culture system, to directly guide iPSC differentiation toward the chondrogenic mesoderm lineage. Subsequently, the research group introduced a tetracycline-controlled BMP4 gene regulation system for iPSCs, linking transcriptional activation of BMP4 with heightened chondrogenesis using the piggyBac (PB) transposon-based gene delivery system. Kotaka and associates used magnetically-labeled iPSCs and an external magnetic force to evaluate the safety and efficacy of magnetic field-mediated delivery of iPSCs for articular cartilage repair in nude rats. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of this approach for in vivo cartilage repair [66].",
        "Surgical interventions are performed to prevent progressing of focal articular cartilage defects [29], however, no effective drugs are available for treatment of cartilage regeneration. Using human MSCs for screening of compounds that promote chondrogenesis has limitations due to limited expansion of MSC passages, variations between donors and the high cost [67]. The development of the iPSC technology and advancement in genome editing approaches provide crucial tools for drug screening by establishing iPSC-derived chondrocytes. Using human iPSCs, a 96-well screening platform was developed to identify chondrogenesis-inducing agents that can be used separately or combined with other techniques for cartilage regeneration and repair. Due to their ability to promote chondrogenesis in vitro and in vivo, AB235 and NB61, two chimeric ligands of Activin/BMP2, were used and tested separately at two different doses for validation of the 96-well chondrogenic screening format. Strikingly, elevated concentrations of each of these two agents resulted in improved chondrogenic differentiation [68]. Another OA drug screening study was conducted on iPSC-derived or native mouse cartilage samples. The inflammatory environment of OA was induced in these cells by interleukin-1α (IL-1α), and a 96-well plate format was used for screening of OA drug candidates. The high-throughput screening revealed that the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) inhibitor SC514 was the most effective drug candidate to reduce cartilage loss induced by IL-1α [69]. Increased mineralization in the FOP-derived iPSCs has been detected, a phenomenon that could be mitigated by the use of the BMP inhibitor DMH1 [70]. It has been demonstrated that statins could effectively rectify the degraded cartilage observed in both chondrogenically differentiated thanatophoric dysplasia type 1 (TD1)- and achondroplasia (ACH)-specific iPSCs [71]. These studies illustrate the potential of iPSCs to provide a suitable platform to identify novel therapeutic agents for cartilage-related disorders and facilitate development of personalized regenerative medicine.",
        "Chondrocytes derived from iPSCs have demonstrated great promise in a variety of regenerative medicine applications, especially in relation to cartilage regeneration and repair [49, 64, 72]. These cells offer regenerative treatments for diseases such as OA and cartilage injuries (Table 1). They can be combined with biomaterial scaffolds or scaffold-free methods to create engineered cartilage grafts for transplantation [73]. Generation of cartilage tissues from patient-specific iPSCs reduces the risk of immunological rejection, thus this personalized strategy has a potential for treating diseases such as OA [19]. Before their clinical application, preclinical studies of the iPSC-derived chondrocytes are crucial to assess their viability, functionality, and safety [74]. iPSC-MSCs were used to repair cartilage defects in a rabbit model. Macroscopic and histological assessment revealed more cartilage repair in the experimental group as compared to both the control and scaffold implantation group. Furthermore, no teratoma formation detected in all the three groups indicating the safety and potential of iPSC-MSCs for cartilage regeneration [75]. Ko et al. [76] implanted iPSC-derived chondrocytes in osteochondral defects in immunosuppressed rats. The defects exhibited a significantly higher quality of cartilage repair than in the control. In another study, homogenous cartilaginous particles derived from chondrocyte-specific reporter hiPSC lines were transplanted into joint surface defects in immunodeficient rat and immunosuppressed mini-pig models. The neocartilage survived and integrated into native cartilage, and no tumor formation was observed in all the animal models following the transplantation [30]. The potential of MSC-based therapies is attributed to the release of trophic factors via paracrine signaling, with small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) potentially playing a significant role [77]. Zhu et al. [78] investigated the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes derived from synovial membrane MSCs (SM-MSC-Exos) and iPSC-MSCs (iPSC-MSC-Exos) in treatment of OA. The injected exosomes in an OA mouse model showed that iPSC-MSC-Exos exhibit a stronger therapeutic impact on OA compared to SM-MSC-Exos. Similarly, iPSC-MSC-derived sEVs injected in degenerative discs of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) rat models revealed significant improvement in IVDD and senescence of nucleus pulposus cells of the IVD [79]. Given the poliferative capacity of autologous iPSC-MSCs, these cells ensure a consistent and abundant source of therapeutic sEVs, which could introduce a new therapeutic strategy for OA and IVDD treatment [78, 79]. As previousely mentioned, Nejadnik et al. developed an effective method to directly differentiate human iPSCs (hiPSCs) into MSCs and chondrocytes without the need for EBs formation. Transplantation of these cells in OA rat models successfully repaired the osteochondral defects [33]. However, the traces of fibrocartilage and hypertrophic cartilage detected in the generated chondrocytes in vitro and use of FBS in the chondrogenic medium may prevent their clinical application. Use of Xeno-free media and thorough characterization of hiPSC-derived MSCs and chondrocytes will be essential prior to transplantation [33]. An intriguing study has demonestrated that chondrogenic spheroids derived from iPSC-MSCs retain cartilage phenotype in vivo comparable to the chondrogenic-like tissues generated from the same cell spheroids in vitro. In contrast to spheroids obtained from iPSC-MSCs, distinct bone-like tissue formation was evident in BM-MSC spheroids. This may prove the capacity of iPSC-MSC-derived chondrogenic spheroids to form cartilage-like tissues without endochondral ossification for treatment of cartilage defects in vivo [24]. Additionally, due to the ability of chondrogenic spheroids to fuse rapidly within a short timeframe, they can serve as as building blocks for constructing larger cartilage tissues using techniques like the Kenzan bioprinting method [56]. Current focus tends to shift towards investigating immune reactions in the context of allogeneic cartilage transplantation. Abe and colleagues were the first to conduct allogeneic cartilage transplantation into a primate model using major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched iPSC-derived cartilage organoids without the need for immunosuppressive drugs [49]. Remarkably, the transplanted organoids exhibited successful engraftment into chondral defects on the knee joint surface of the primate model, demonstrating survival, integration, and remodeling similar to native cartilage, without any observed immune reactions [49]. The findings of these preclinical studies demonstrate effective and clinically translatable approaches for regenerating cartilage tissue using hiPSC-derived MSCs and chondrocytes, offering potential enhancements in cartilage regeneration outcomes in cartilage diseases.",
        "Over the past decade, iPSCs have shown significant advancements, offering new prospects for personalized cell therapy. Patient-derived iPSCs exhibit a lower risk of rejection compared to allogeneic iPSCs. Therefore, some challenges such as tumorigenicity or immunogenicity must be addressed before the iPSCs can be extensively utilized in clinical therapy. To date, 89 clinical trials referenced under “induced pluripotent stem cells” have been registered on the World Health Organization (WHO)-managed main databases (https://clinicaltrials.gov/, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), https://trialsearch.who.int/). Several studies from the Japan Primary Registries Network (https://rctportal.niph.go.jp/en) can be added to the list since most of their 21 iPSCs trials are not cross-referenced with the WHO’s platforms. Among the total 110 identified clinical trials, 51 trials were registered as interventional and the remaining as observational. Despite the low rejection risk, slow shifting from autologous to allogenic iPSC-derived therapy approach has been crucial due to the time and cost required for characterization and safety testing of each cell line. Furthermore, allogeneic iPSCs approach allow more time for the testing process, and once an approved cell line is established, it can be used to treat multiple patients. Opting for allogeneic cell therapy would result in a readily accessible therapeutic product for interventions [80].",
        "Until recently, pluripotent cell-derived MSCs were not a popular focus in clinical research, with only a small number of studies exploring this area, despite the wide variety of potential tissues that could be produced. Currently, only three clinical trials involving ESC-derived MSCs [81–83], and six iPSC-MSCs clinical trials have been reported (Table 2) [84, 85]. It is important to note that from the six clinical trials, cartilage regeneration through iPSC-MSCs was only addressed in two studies. In 2020, the University of Sydney and Cynata Therapeutics conducted phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of an allogenic MSCs therapy (Cymerus MSCs) for tibiofemoral knee OA [86]. Lately, Cynata Therapeutics has reported that 321 subjects were recruited for the phase 3 SCUlpTOR clinical trial which will start in 2024 for 24 months (Trial ID: ACTRN12620000870954). In the foreseeable future, the phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by the Chinese Nuwacell Biotechnology company will investigate the safety and efficacy of the NCR100 allogenic iPSC-MSCs intra-articular injection for treatment of knee OA (Trial ID: NCT06049342). This is the first Chinese iPSC-derived cell product approved to be used in phase 1 clinical trial following six years of research and development, (https://en.nuwacell.com/news). It is to be noted that a study tried to directly differentiate allogenic iPSCs into chondrocytes without intermediate MSCs differentiation, to treat knee OA as well (Trial ID: jRCTa050190104). The 2020 Japanese interventional trial from Kyoto University was followed by a second observational trial in 2020 for post-treatment evaluation on the subject’s knees (Trial ID: jRCT1050220051).Table 2Cartilage-related clinical trials using iPSC-MSCs and chondrocytesTrial IDTitleRecruitment StatusEstimated number of participantsPhaseCell typeStudy typeConditionStart date (estimated)CountrySponsoriPSC-derived MSCsNCT06049342A phase I, open label, single arm, multiple center, dose escalation clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of human iPSC-derived MSCs (NCR100) injection in the treatment of subjects With KOANot yet recruiting12Phase 1AllogenicInterventionalKOA25.01.2024ChinaNuwacell Biotechnologies Co., Ltdhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/ACTRN12620000870954Evaluating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of stem cell injections in people with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis: a randomised placebo-controlled trial (The SCUlpTOR trial)Recruiting440Phase 3AllogenicInterventionalKOA15.03.2021AustraliaCynata Therapeutics Limitedhttps://anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12620000870954.aspxiPSC-derived chondrocytesJPRN-jRCTa050190104NIPHaA clinical study for treatment of articular cartilage damage in knee joints with allogeneic iPSC-derived cartilage. -TACK-iPSTerminated4N/AAllogeneicInterventionalKOA11.11.2020JapanMatsuda Shuichi, Kyoto University Hospitalhttps://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=JPRN-jRCTa050190104JPRN-jRCT1050220051Evaluation of knee function and safety after treatment of articular cartilage damage in knee joints with allogeneic iPSC-derived cartilageRecruiting4N/AAllogenicObservationalKOA16.06.2022JapanMatsuda Shuichi, Kyoto University Hospitalhttps://jrct.niph.go.jp/en-latest-detail/jRCT1050220051ID: identification number; iPS: induced pluripotent stem; iPSC: induced pluripotent stem cell; KOA: Knee osteoarthritis, N/A: not applicableaThis clinical trial was discontinued",

        "As a concluding remark, there have been no results regarding cartilage regeneration through iPSC-derived cell therapy in these trials so far. The scarcity of iPSC-MSCs and cartilage-oriented clinical trials indicates significant potential for further advancement and enhancement. Hopefully with the extensively growing iPSCs research, cartilage regeneration for condition such as OA will receive greater attention.",
        "Throughout this review, numerous studies have demonstrated the tremendous advantages offered by iPSC-derived chondrocytes for cartilage research. However, there are some limitations associated with iPSC-derived chondrocyte in vitro models. The first limitation is that the iPSC-derived chondrocytes may show an immature phenotype, and it is still challenging to obtain iPSC-derived chondrocytes with full maturation and stability [87]. The second limitation is the possibility to generate diverse cell populations with variation in maturation stages. This heterogeneity might complicate result interpretation and compromise the validity and reproducibility of experimental results [22]. Due to the potential of iPSCs to form teratomas, residual undifferentiated iPSCs in iPSC-derived cartilage grafts may pose a risk of tumor formation in transplantation studies [88]. Another main challenge is the variability in the efficiency of chondrogenic differentiation among different iPSC lines and even among clones of the same line [31]. Moreover, the culture conditions for differentiation of iPSCs to chondrocytes may not fully replicate the complex microenvironment of native cartilage tissue. The artificial culture conditions can influence cellular behavior and might not fully capture the in vivo physiological and mechanical complexity of chondrocytes [18, 24]. Even though patient-derived iPSCs can potentially reduce the immunological rejection [89], the in vitro differentiation and manipulation processes may introduce foreign antigens, raising concerns about the immunogenicity of the generated chondrocytes [19]. In addition, the ability of iPSC-derived chondrocytes to produce a mature and robust ECM may be limited. The structure and organization of the ECM are essential for the functionality and integrity of cartilage tissue. Therefore, ECM defects may affect the utility of in vitro models [90]. Last, but not the least, the robustness of cartilage in vitro models may be affected by the technical aspects of iPSC maintenance, differentiation, and characterization, which may introduce variability [32]. These limitations illuminate the challenges associated with iPSC-derived chondrocyte in vitro models. Improvement and optimization of chondrogenic differentiation protocols may overcome these limitations and ensure reliable and comparable results across various studies.",
        "The potential of iPSC-derived technologies in chondrogenesis, offering significant benefits for OA and other medical conditions, is evident. However, unlocking these benefits encounters hurdles such as limited process understanding, outdated manufacturing techniques, and insufficient automation. Manual manufacturing and quality control processes prove labor-intensive and error prone. To address the anticipated demand for iPSC-derived cells, scalable production methods must be developed to uphold clinical-grade yields and immunomodulatory properties. Moreover, research indicates that human iPSCs might present an epigenetic edge compared to adult stem cells in producing chondrocytes on a large scale without a tendency towards hypertrophy. Ko and his team showcased heightened expression of key chondrogenic markers such as SOX9, COL2A1, and aggrecan (ACAN), alongside decreased levels of hypertrophic markers like COL10A1 and RUNX2 in iPSC-derived chondrocytes when compared to BM-MSC pellets [76].",
        "It is crucial to establish robust protocols for large-scale iPSC production to support tasks like cell banking. Thorough evaluations of iPSC-derived chondrocytes in large-scale production settings are essential for consistent quality outcomes and to tackle the challenge of spontaneous differentiation. Closing the gap between research and clinical application necessitates the development of scaled production technologies spanning from initial seeding to final fill-and-finish stages. Embracing full automation in iPSCs cell therapy manufacturing and quality control is paramount for enhancing both product quality and production efficiency in this rapidly evolving field [91]. A recent study developed hiPSC-derived limb bud mesenchymal cells (ExpLBM cells) with strong chondrogenic potential and stable proliferation. Using a stirred bioreactor, this method outperformed conventional culture plate methods by yielding significant cartilage tissue with just 1 × 106 cells. This produced significant amounts of cartilaginous particles, suggesting a scalable method for cartilage regeneration without immune rejection. This efficient approach requires minimal cell quantities and offers potential scalability through adjustments in medium volume and cell numbers [92]. Another recent study has introduced GelMA microcarriers developed via step emulsification microfluidic devices as a degradable platform for amplifying iPSC-MSCs in scalable bioreactors, while maintaining typical MSC traits and immune-modulatory capabilities. These GelMA microcarriers, manufactured with efficiency and reproducibility in mind, facilitate substantial expansion of iPSC-MSCs (up to 16 times within 8 days) in vertical wheel bioreactors, with a post-digestion viability exceeding 95%. When compared to monolayer culture, iPSC-MSCs expanded on GelMA microcarriers exhibit at least similar, if not superior, immune-modulatory potential. This approach marks a notable progression in producing immune-modulatory iPSC-MSCs, providing scalability, cost-efficiency, and simplified cell retrieval through direct dissolution of microcarriers, thereby minimizing cell wastage [93].",
        "A novel, good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant scalable manufacturing procedure is introduced for the fabrication of iPSC-MSCs, tackling the aforementioned hurdles. By employing xenogeneic-, serum-, and feeder-free conditions, alongside chemically defined maintenance for iPSCs, the process eliminates the necessity for murine feeders and accomplishes mesoderm induction, resulting in heightened performance of MSCs in immunopotency assessments. The manufacturing process comprises three phases: iPSC banking, iPSC expansion and differentiation into MSCs, and MSC expansion and formulation of the final clinical product. Impressively, one vial of iPSCs can yield an average of 3.2 × 1010 MSCs, and the complete iPSC bank has the potential to generate 2.9 × 1015 MSCs, equating to 29 million clinical doses, each containing 1 × 108 MSCs. This method presents a promising resolution to the challenges of supply, scalability, and consistency in iPSC-MSC production, paving the way for their utilization in clinical applications with heightened efficacy and safety. This optimized manufacturing process for iPSC-MSCs has been applied in treating steroid-resistant acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGvHD) in a phase 1 clinical trial but could be similarly employed in the iPSC-MSCs-Chondrocyte approach for chondrogenesis [84].",
        "The aim of automating cell therapy manufacturing is to reduce human intervention, ensuring sterile processes within isolator-like platforms to minimize contamination risks. Despite notable advancements, challenges persist, including difficulties in executing specific biological procedures with robotic assistance, prompting the need for exploring new solutions and standardization. Establishing an automated manufacturing platform requires precise definition of process parameters and configurations through validated standard operating procedures (SOPs). To address these needs, an advanced automated cell manufacturing platform was employed to produce both equine and human iPSC-MSCs via EBs [94]. These iPSC-MSCs were further demonstrated their ability to differentiate into adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages proficiently. The main goal of this study was to develop a simplified and uniform procedure for isolating MSCs from peripheral blood under GMP conditions, ensuring their viability and purity. Compared to existing protocols documented in the literature, this approach offers simplicity, scalability and consistently delivering robust cell purity [94]. Recently, another automatic system was reported to produce iPSC-derived therapies, covering a range of cell types including iPSC-MSCs, iPSC-derived chondrocytes, and extracellular vesicles [95]. iPSC expansion and differentiation into MSCs and chondrocytes take place in plates, while expansion of iPSC-derived MSCs and production of extracellular vesicles utilize microcarriers within stirred tank bioreactors. The system is designed to oversee iPSC expansion, differentiation, and the fill and finish of the products. Furthermore, this platform including a range of quality control assays such as microscopy, cell counting, viability assessment, qPCR, and endotoxin assays, aims to address these challenges by establishing an automated platform for producing cell therapies specifically targeting OA, and serves as an example of how existing automation technology can be customized and improved to enhance scalability and efficiency.",
        "Genomic abnormalities detected during the reprogramming and subsequent expansion of iPSCs raised serious safety concerns [96]. Therefore, several factors including starting cell source, method of delivery, reprogramming factor and cell passage, should be taken into consideration for the generation of iPSCs in order to reduce not only genomic instability [97], but also immunogenicity [98, 99].",
        "The field of iPSC-derived cartilages is rapidly evolving, and several approaches and perspectives have been explored to tackle limitations and enhance the potential applications of these cells in regenerative medicine. Development of new or optimization of the current differentiation protocols to improve the maturation and stability of iPSC-derived chondrocytes is critical [25]. This can be achieved by further research on signaling pathways, culture conditions, and other factors that facilitate the maturation of iPSC-derived chondrocytes. It is significantly important to implement cutting-edge 3D culture systems combined with ink-free bioprinting technique to more closely mimic the in vivo microenvironment of cartilage tissue [56]. Using bioreactors, biomimetic scaffolds, 3D bioprinting and other advanced technologies can improve the functional characteristics of iPSC-derived chondrocytes for cartilage repair. Generation of heterogeneous cell populations remains one of the major challenges in development of efficient cartilage grafts [100]. To eliminate undesired cells and promote the homogeneity of iPSC-derived chondrocyte populations, sustained development of precise genome editing tools is quite essential. Moreover, it is necessary to identify the sources of heterogeneity in iPSC-derived chondrocyte populations to reduce variability and improve reproducibility [101]. Tumorigenicity associated with residual undifferentiated iPSCs can be addressed by advancements in purification methods and genetic modifications to increase the safety of iPSC-derived chondrocytes for clinical applications [102]. Moreover, scalability and cost-effectiveness of the methods used for generation of iPSC-derived chondrocytes should be improved by simplifying the differentiation protocols, optimizing culture conditions, and utilizing automation technologies [95]. Additionally, it is very crucial to enhance the development of in vivo models to investigate the safety and efficacy of iPSC-derived chondrocytes in preclinical studies [103]. Successful preclinical studies should be followed by well-designed clinical trials in patients with cartilage-related disorders. Furthermore, for personalized regenerative medicine, the design of preclinical and clinical trials should focus on the integration of patient-specific iPSCs with advanced gene editing technologies and highly efficient chondrogenic differentiation protocols. These future perspectives reflect the continuous endeavors to harness the full potential of iPSC-derived chondrocytes, opening the door for innovative approaches in cartilage regeneration and repair. Since this field is advancing rapidly, interdisciplinary collaborations and advancement in technologies will play a vital role in shaping the future of iPSC-based cartilage regeneration research.",

The terms precision and personalized medicines are sometimes applied interchangeably. However, there has been a shift from \"personalized medicine\" towards \"precision medicine\". Although personalized medicine emerged from pharmacogenetics, nowadays it covers many fields of healthcare. Accordingly, regenerative medicine and cellular therapy as the new fields of medicine use cell-based products in order to develop personalized treatments. Different sources of stem cells including mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been considered in targeted therapies which could give many advantages. iPSCs as the novel and individual pluripotent stem cells have been introduced as the appropriate candidates for personalized cell therapies. Cellular therapies can provide a personalized approach. Because of person-to-person and population differences in the result of stem cell therapy, individualized cellular therapy must be adjusted according to the patient specific profile, in order to achieve best therapeutic results and outcomes. Several factors should be considered to achieve personalized stem cells therapy such as, recipient factors, donor factors, and the overall body environment in which the stem cells could be active and functional. In addition to these factors, the source of stem cells must be carefully chosen based on functional and physical criteria that lead to optimal outcomes.

        "The distinctive capacity of stem cells to self-renew and differentiate positions them as a cornerstone of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. These properties have enabled breakthroughs in organ-on-a-chip models, organoids, bone grafts, and exosome-based therapies. Recent advances in biomaterial-assisted technologies—such as 3D bioprinting, engineered scaffolds, and spatially controlled microenvironments—are accelerating the clinical translation of stem cell therapies by addressing critical barriers in cell survival, differentiation, and functional integration (Vunjak-Novakovic and Scadden, 2011). However, persistent challenges, including post-implantation teratomas, immune rejection, differentiation variability, and the incomplete functional maturity of derived cells continue to hinder clinical progress. This review focuses on biomaterial-assisted stem cell therapies, emphasizing the innovative use of engineered materials to overcome these limitations. Unlike conventional approaches that adapt stem cells to pre-existing biomaterials, we propose a “bottom-up” design framework where “bottom” refers to the fundamental biological and microenvironmental needs of stem cells (e.g., mechanical cues, biochemical gradients, cell-cell interactions), and “up” represents the development of cell-instructive biomaterials tailored to these requirements. By prioritizing stem cell biology in material design, this strategy addresses key challenges such as differentiation fidelity, functional maturation of embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (ESCs and iPSCs), and the survival of therapeutic populations like endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in hostile microenvironments.",
        "We critically analyze recent advances in biomaterial-driven stem cell culture, differentiation protocols, and clinical applications, highlighting how tailored materials can replicate lineage-specific cues to enhance therapeutic outcomes. This paradigm shift from passive scaffolds to dynamic, cell-instructive platforms offers a transformative roadmap for bridging the gap between laboratory innovation and clinical translation, enabling safer, more effective regenerative therapies.",
        "There are multiple classifications of stem cells based on their origin, differentiation capacity, and function. Here, we summarize the broadest categories of stem cells: Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs), Somatic Stem Cells (SSCs), and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs). Additional coverage is also given to SSCs that are widely used in regenerative medicine research, including Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) and Endothelial Colony-Forming Cells (ECFCs).",
        "Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) are pluripotent cells that arise from the inner cell mass of an embryo at the blastocyst stage of development, 4–7 days post-fertilization. ESCs then differentiate into the endoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, giving rise to all somatic cell types in the body (Thomson et al., 1998; National Academies Press US, 2002). As harvesting human ESCs requires the destruction of the embryo, their use in research and medicine is controversial. Prior to 2009, the United States prohibited federal funding to ESC lines generated before 9 August 2001, effectively curtailing the making of new ESC lines. Although these restrictions have somewhat been lifted [see (Matthews and Morali, 2022) for a recent review of laws in the United States governing embryonic research], the ethical and legal dilemmas of using ESCs have caused researchers to seek alternatives (Snead, 2005).",
        "In 2006, Takahashi et al. identified four transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, that, when expressed in adult somatic cells, allows them to be reprogrammed into a pluripotent state. These cells, called induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs), express ESC markers and have the same capacity for self-renewal and differentiation (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006; Takahashi et al., 2007). This breakthrough revolutionized the field of regenerative medicine, opening new avenues for research and therapeutic applications without the ethical concerns of ESCs or the difficulty of sourcing SSCs.",
        "Although iPSCs are a powerful tool for research [see Section 3], there are still roadblocks to the goal of having autologous, iPSC-derived cells available for patients. Although iPSCs have similar morphology and function to ESCs, they still retain epigenetic “memory” from their original phenotype (Kim et al., 2010). This can cause challenges during differentiation, as iPSCs can be biased towards their original lineage (Polo et al., 2010; Bar-Nur et al., 2011). Due to this, donor viability, tissue of origin, as well as differentiation method can influence the reprogramming of iPSCs. According to Kyttala et al., the epigenetic background of the donor highly affects the reprogramming of the iPSCs. While the iPSCs derived from a single source donor are highly similar to each other, genetic differences between donors influence iPSC gene expression patterns and DNA methylation profiles (Kyttälä et al., 2016).",
        "Furthermore, a major concern with iPSCs is their tumorigenic potential. If differentiation is incomplete or residual pluripotent cells persist, iPSCs can form teratomas—tumors containing multiple tissue types (Griscelli et al., 2012). This poses a significant safety challenge, as uncontrolled cell proliferation and incomplete or heterogeneous differentiation can result in unintended tissue formation, thereby limiting their clinical utility. To address these risks, researchers are actively developing and optimizing protocols to ensure complete and precise differentiation of iPSCs before they are used in research or therapeutic applications (Lin et al., 2024; Singh et al., 2015).",
        "Despite current limitations, iPSCs remain an attractive technology for regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and personalized cell therapy, in hopes to tackle neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer (Cerneckis et al., 2024; Rezza et al., 2014).",
        "Somatic Stem Cells (SSCs), also known as Adult Stem Cells (ASCs) are multi and unipotent stem cells found in the adult body. They reside in specialized environments known as stem cell niches. The stem cell niche is composed of the SSCs and their surrounding stromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM), which provide a combination of mechanical feedback and signaling molecules that maintain the SSCs in a quiescent state. These signals are further influenced by surrounding vasculature, immune cells, and neurons, depending on the SSC lineage (Rezza et al., 2014). The stem cell niche can change to facilitate SSC activation, prompting SSCs to self-renew and differentiate to provide new cells for tissue maintenance and repair (Montagnani et al., 2016; Mannino et al., 2022).",
        "SSCs are found in almost every tissue in the body, including the brain, muscles, fat, bone, intestines, liver, and skin (Brunet et al., 2023). One of the best-characterized SSC is the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), which is found in the bone marrow. HSCs constantly generate new red blood cells, platelets, and immune cells (Bryder et al., 2006). Bone marrow transplants and hematopoietic cells from umbilical cord blood are used as treatments for patients with blood cancer (Author Anonymous, 2023). With the exception of MSCs [see Section 2.3.1], there are currently no other SSCs that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medical use.",
        "Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs), sometimes referred to as Mesenchymal Stem Cells, are plastic-adherent cells that can differentiate into osteoblasts (bone-forming), adipocytes (fat-forming), and chondrocytes (cartilage-forming) in vitro (Mai et al., 2023; Horwitz et al., 2005). However, due to having limited self-renewal, as well as difficulties replicating their differentiation in vivo, there is significant debate as to whether or not they can truly be considered a multipotent stem cell (Singh et al., 2015; Caplan, 2017; Phinney et al., 2023).",
        "MSCs are used in regenerative medicine due to their ability to influence the behavior of other cells. They produce a wide range of extracellular vesicles, growth factors, proteins, cytokines, and chemokines, the total of which are referred to as the MSC secretome (Eleuteri and Fierabracci, 2019). MSCs and their secretome modulate immune responses (Dabrowska et al., 2021) and have been shown to promote wound healing, vascularization, and tissue repair, making them an increasingly popular addition in engineered tissues as well as candidate for clinical treatments (Liu et al., 2023a; An et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Neef et al., 2022; Takeuchi et al., 2021). In December 2024, the first MSC clinical product, Mesoblast’s RYONCIL™, was approved by the FDA to treat Steroid-Refractory Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease. This disease is a serious and sometimes deadly complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants, during which the transplanted cells attack the recipient’s tissues (Justiz Vaillant et al., 2025). During treatment, MSCs are given via infusion to downregulate inflammatory cytokines while promoting anti-inflammatory cytokine and immune cell activity (Commissioner O of the FDA, 2024; Mesoblast, 2025).",
        "In 2004, Ingram et al. discovered putative endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) with robust vascular sprouting ability (Ingram et al., 2004). These cells were previously known by various terms such as late EPCs, large EPCs, and non-hematopoietic EPCs, among others. They are now termed endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs). These multipotent cells can give rise to endothelial cells and have the potential to regenerate blood vessels (Ingram et al., 2004). The ability of ECFCs to form vasculature has applications for treating ischemia after heart attack or stroke. For instance, studies show that when ECFCs are introduced into ischemic tissues, they can contribute to neovascularization, improving blood flow and tissue viability (Liu et al., 2024a), (O'Neill et al., 2018). In xenograft models, where human ECFCs are implanted into immunocompromised mice, they have been shown to integrate into the host vasculature and promote angiogenesis. This integration is crucial for restoring blood supply to ischemic tissues, as seen in models of hindlimb ischemia and myocardial infarction (Bryder et al., 2006; Author Anonymous, 2023; Mai et al., 2023; Viswanathan et al., 2019; Dabrowska et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023a; An et al., 2018).",
        "The therapeutic effects of ECFCs are attributed not only to their ability to differentiate into endothelial cells but also to their secretion of pro-angiogenic factors that stimulate surrounding host cells in ischemic environments through multiple endogenous and exogenous mechanisms that enhance their paracrine activity and therapeutic effects (Caplan, 2017; Deng et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). This paracrine signaling enhances the overall angiogenic response in the ischemic environment.",
        "ECFCs can be derived from a patient’s own peripheral blood, allowing for personalized therapeutic approaches. This method reduces the risk of immune rejection and eliminates the need for immunosuppressive drugs, which are often necessary in allogeneic therapies. There is preclinical evidence that has demonstrated that ECFC administration can enhance vascular stability and promote regeneration of damaged tissues through both direct engraftment and paracrine signaling mechanisms. This highlights their role not only in direct treatment but also in supporting the body’s natural repair processes (Hanjaya-Putra et al., 2013; Hall et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b). However, it is noted that ECFCs from non-healthy patients may exhibit dysfunction (Bui et al., 2022; Hanjaya-Putra et al., 2013; Besnier et al., 2021; Melero-Martin, 2022; Hall et al., 2023) necessitating strategies to enhance their functionality before therapeutic application. Furthermore, the media and extracellular matrix coating used to expand isolated ECFC in vitro can influence their functionality (Hall et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b). Therefore standardized methods for isolating and expanding ECFCs in vitro before transplantation are needed (Bell et al., 2023; Varberg et al., 2018). While challenges such as donor-specific dysfunction and expansion protocol variability remain, the unparalleled regenerative capacity of ECFCs Figure 1. —coupled with emerging bioengineering strategies to optimize their function—positions these cells as transformative agents in vascular repair, warranting continued investment to harness their full therapeutic potential.",

        "Currently, bringing a new drug to the clinical market takes 10–15 years costs approximately $1-2 billion. Much of this time and cost is due to a 90% failure rate during clinical trials (Dowden and Munro, 2019). When looking at failed drugs that initially passed clinical trials, 40% are removed due to low efficacy (Sun et al., 2022); what works on a Petri dish or a mouse may not function similarly for a human being (Tang et al., 2022a; Mozneb et al., 2024). As such, it is paramount to develop more effective preclinical models that capture complex disease behaviors, drug metabolomics, and allow for high-throughput testing. Due to their ability to be passaged almost indefinitely, as well as their ability to differentiate into difficult-to-source cell types, stem cells are now at the forefront of disease modeling.",
        "There are multiple benefits to using iPSC-derived models in disease research. The first is their ability to differentiate into difficult-to-source human cells, such as neurons and cardiomyocytes. In this role, they can act as a positive control against genetically and chemically-induced models of diseases. For example, a 2019 study of Sporadic Alzheimer’s Disease (SAD) used iPSCs generated from donors with SAD and healthy individuals to generate iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells. These were compared with gene-edited cells to study the causes of neural gene network disruption (Meyer et al., 2019). iPSC-derived cells can also be used to overcome limitations in current mouse models for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders (Deng, 2017; Guerreiro and Maciel, 2023). Furthermore, a single iPSC line can be differentiated into several cell types to generate complex in vitro models (e.g., creating a co-culture of both neurons and supporting glial cells) as well as screening multiple cell types for off-target effects in drug research. This makes them suitable for organ-on-a-chip models, which have gained popularity due to their ability to model complex systems and perform high-throughput drug screening in a resource-efficient manner. For instance, iPSCs have been incorporated into chip models of the blood-retinal barrier (ARIK et al., 2021), intestine (Moerkens et al., 2024), heart (Tang et al., 2022a; Mozneb et al., 2024; Ronaldson-Bouchard et al., 2022), and liver (Scheidecker et al., 2024).",
        "Another advantage of iPSCs is their genetic heterogeneity. Factors such as ethnicity, sex, and age impact a patient’s response to medications (Johnson, 2008; Zucker and Prendergast, 2020; Mangoni and Jackson, 2004). For in vitro drug screening, increasing the diversity of iPSC patient-donors provides a more robust method for testing the toxicity and functionality of the treatment. Heterogeneity is also critical when searching for the underlying causes of disease. In addition to using cells from “healthy” donors, it is possible to derive iPSCs from patients diagnosed with sporadic and familial diseases (Jang et al., 2012). As such, researchers can compare genotypes across ranges of disease severity, as well as examine diseases which may have several different mutations that can result in the same clinical presentation, such as in cardiovascular diseases (Kelly and Semsarian, 2009; Saha et al., 2024).",
        "To increase the accessibility of diverse iPSC lines in research, there are currently over a dozen well-established stem cell banks worldwide which encompass thousands of cell lines and diseases (Chen et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2019). These include the European Bank for induced pluripotent Stem Cells (EBiSC), California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics International (FCDI), and the Taiwan Human Disease iPSC Consortium. Additionally, there exist disease-specific iPSC banks which focus on Sickle-Cell Disease (Park et al., 2017), psychiatric disorders (Rademaker et al., 2018), and aging (Dowrey et al., 2025).",
        "However, iPSC heterogeneity can also originate from differentiation protocols and culture conditions. This is illustrated by Le Cann et al.’s comparison of two differentiation methods in an iPSC-derived model of Huntington Disease. Despite starting from the same iPSC line, the iPSC-derived striatal medium spiny neurons showed differences in voltage-dependent activation and inactivation, as well as protein markers, depending on which differentiation protocol was used (Le Cann et al., 2021). Such differences cast doubt on the validity of iPSC disease models, as seen in the high variability found in a meta-analysis of iPSC Cystic Fibrosis models (Darwish et al., 2022). To ameliorate this problem, researchers could include multiple donors or study iPSC-derived cell models alongside native cells.",
        "Another solution is the establishment of robust negative controls to isolate disease-specific phenotypes from confounding genetic and environmental variables. While early iPSC studies relied on unrelated healthy donor lines as controls, this approach introduced significant heterogeneity due to differences in genetic backgrounds, epigenetic memory, and differentiation biases (Yang et al., 2020; Rauth et al., 2021). Modern strategies prioritize isogenic controls—CRISPR-edited lines derived from the same parental iPSC—to create genetically matched pairs differing only in the disease-causing mutation. Recent protocols combining p53 inhibition and pro-survival small molecules achieve >90% homologous recombination efficiency, enabling rapid generation of isogenic pairs with minimal off-target effects (Singh et al., 2024). For example, in cardiac long QT syndrome models, CRISPR-edited iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with KCNQ1/KCNH2 mutations showed prolonged action potential durations compared to unedited controls, establishing a template for drug screening (Doss and Sachinidis, 2019).",
        "Beyond genetic standardization, biomaterial platforms can also enhance control validity by recreating tissue-specific physical niches. Hydrogels provide critical standardization for iPSC-derived Parkinson’s Disease (PD) models by recreating brain-specific microenvironments. For example, hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogels have been used to generate midbrain-mimetic 3D cultures, enabling the differentiation of iPSCs into dopaminergic (DA) neurons with forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain gene expression profiles. These HA scaffolds support organoid development and physiological neurobehavior, offering a biomaterial baseline for comparing healthy and PD-specific phenotypes (Zhu et al., 2025). Similarly, collagen (COLL) hydrogels loaded with glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) enhance the survival and striatal innervation of DA neurons in PD models, providing a functional benchmark for assessing disease-driven connectivity defects (Zhu et al., 2025). These biomaterial frameworks disentangle genetic effects from mechanical confounders, enabling reliable drug screens targeting pathogenic pathways. Finally, emerging best practices validate isogenic controls across multi-omic layers—single-cell transcriptomics to confirm differentiation fidelity, electrophysiological profiling for functional benchmarking, and proteomics to identify off-target editing effects (McTague et al., 2021; Volpato and Webber, 2020). Challenges remain in modeling complex diseases, where residual epigenetic memory in iPSC-derived ‘healthy’ controls may skew results, necessitating validation against primary tissue samples.",
        "Organoids are three dimensional clusters of cells cultured in-vitro that can self-organize and differentiate into functional cell types (Corrò et al., 2020). The most prominent applications of human organoids lie in their ability to serve as sophisticated models for understanding human diseases, discovering and testing new drugs, and ultimately guiding personalized therapeutic strategies (Yang et al., 2020). Their human origin and 3D architecture provide significant advantages over traditional 2D cell cultures and animal models in biomedical research.",
        "Organoid generation techniques rely on cell sources such as pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), adult stem cells (ASCs), or patient-derived tissues, each selected based on the target organ and research objectives (Calà et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2022b). For example, intestinal organoids require Wnt agonists (e.g., R-spondin) and Noggin to maintain crypt-like structures, while lung organoids depend on FGF7/FGF10 for morphogenesis (Tang et al., 2022b; Unagolla and Jayasuriya, 2022). Culture techniques such as the use of bioreactors also enhance scalability and maturation by improving nutrient/oxygen diffusion through constant spinning, enabling long-term cultures (Calà et al., 2023; Gunti et al., 2021).",
        "Advanced platforms like organoid-on-chip integrate microfluidics to simulate dynamic physiological forces (e.g., shear stress) and automate drug screening (Reumann et al., 2023; Lorenzo-Martín et al., 2024a).",
        "A foundational application of organoids in biotechnology lies in genetic engineering, where they serve as dynamic platforms to model human diseases and dissect gene function with unprecedented precision. CRISPR/Cas9 is widely used in organoid research to model diseases and dissect gene function (Gopal et al., 2020). Early application in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) or adult stem cells (ASCs) allows precise introduction of mutations. (e.g., APC or TP53 knockouts in colorectal organoids to mimic tumorigenesis) or correction of disease-causing variants (e.g., CFTR repair in cystic fibrosis models) (Gunti et al., 2021; Artegiani et al., 2020)",
        "Recent advances in organoid technology have revolutionized disease modeling by enabling the study of complex human pathologies in physiologically relevant 3D systems. Figure 2 highlights key models across major organ systems, each offering unique insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic development. Brain organoids can model brain tumor formation and recapitulate neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes such as autism and Parkinson’s disease (Bian et al., 2018; Eichmüller and Knoblich, 2022; Reumann et al., 2023). Gastrointestinal models have illuminated host-microbiome interactions and epithelial barrier dysfunctions in inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer (Günther et al., 2022; Lorenzo-Martín et al., 2024a; Lorenzo-Martín et al., 2024b). Kidney organoids provide platforms for studying polycystic kidney disease and drug-induced nephrotoxicity, leveraging CRISPR-edited iPSCs to model genetic mutations (Romero-Guevara et al., 2020). Pancreatic cancer organoids capture tumor heterogeneity and metastatic potential, enabling studies on epigenetic reprogramming and stromal crosstalk (Chen et al., 2024). Lung organoids model respiratory infections and fibrotic remodeling, while cardiovascular systems replicate structural defects and cardiomyopathies, offering insights into cell-cell communication and drug screening (Vaupel et al., 2021; Pham et al., 2018). These organ-specific models exemplify the transformative potential of organoid technology in bridging molecular mechanisms with tissue-level pathophysiology.",

        "The potential of organoids in regenerative medicine is vast, offering the first step towards bioengineered organs. Organoids can develop into macroscopic structures visible to the eye and, with proper maintenance, can continue to grow. However, one of the key challenges in organoid research is vascularization-the formation of blood vessels within organoids. Without a vascular network, organoids growing past a certain size will develop a necrotic core due to limited nutrient and oxygen diffusion. This maximum size varies depending on the metabolic needs of the particular organoid, but it is generally less than 200 μm in radius (Vilinski-Mazur et al., 2025; Vaupel et al., 2021).",
        "To address these challenges, researchers have implemented various techniques for vascularization. One method uses an “outside in” approach by embedding an already-formed organoid in a hydrogel scaffold that has been seeded with endothelial cells. This allows vessels to grow into the organoid, as seen in Pham et al.'s cerebral organoids, which utilized iPSC-derived endothelial cells seeded in matrigel to reflect the process of vascularization in the fetal brain (Pham et al., 2018). Another approach is to co-culture cell types of interest with endothelial cells which then self-assemble into vessels. Tekebe et al. successfully developed vascularized, functional human liver buds by mixing iPSC-derived hepatic endoderm cells with human umbilical venous endothelial cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (Takebe et al., 2013). Recent research has pushed this concept by directly differentiating endothelial cells alongside the primary organoid cell type, reducing the need for multiple cell sources when designing organoids. Cakir et al. found that over-expressing endothelial transcription factor ETV2 in human embryonic stem cells was sufficient to form vascular-like structures in brain organoids independent of media (Cakir et al., 2019). Skylar-Scott et al. streamlined this process by simultaneously differentiating neural stem cells and vascular endothelial cells from iPSCs using a method known as orthogonally induced differentiation. Here, iPSCs were pre-programmed to express either ETV2 or neuronal transcription factor NGN1 in the presence of doxycycline (Skylar-Scott et al., 2022). However, gene overexpression is not the only method to induce the formation of vascular networks. Homan et al. found that culturing kidney organoids under high fluid flow encouraged the proliferation of endogenous KDR+ endothelial progenitor cells and the formation of vascular networks, while organoids without this environmental cue failed to form vessels (Homan et al., 2019).",
        "Beyond vascularization, organoids hold immense promise for personalized cell therapy and tissue repair. By incorporating bioengineering scaffolds, organoids have an even greater potential for creating complex in vitro tissue structures as an alternative to in vivo studies while still accurately modeling the complex nature of the body (Nwokoye and Abilez, 2024; Yin et al., 2016; Li et al., 2024).",
        "Despite their potential, organoid research faces several limitations. One major hurdle is the scalability and reproducibility - generating consistent organoids remains a challenge due to variability in differentiation efficiency and culture conditions. Additionally, the timeline for organoid development is lengthy. While the initial generation of organoids takes approximately a week, maturation can require at least a month, depending on the cell type (Porciúncula et al., 2021). This extended culture period presents logistical challenges for high-throughput applications and clinical translation.",
        "Personalized medicine tailors medical treatments to the patient, incorporating their genetic profile, lifestyle, and environment. This field leverages advancements in genomics, proteomics, pharmacogenomics, and AI-driven diagnostics to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize side effects (Arjmand et al., 2017; Akhondzadeh, 2014; Quazi, 2022; Molla and Bitew, 2024). While regenerative medicine is often applied in areas like organ regeneration, wound healing, and stem cell-based therapies for injuries or diseases (Murphy and Atala, 2014; Song and Ott, 2011; Duscher et al., 2015), personalized medicine is widely used in targeted cancer therapies, precision drug dosing, and managing chronic conditions based on individual risk factors (Besnier et al., 2021; Melero-Martin, 2022).",
        "Tissue engineering is an evolving field that aims to create functional tissues and organs to address critical needs such as wound healing and organ transplantation. By integrating biomaterials, stem cells, and bioengineering techniques, researchers are attempting to address these shortages. One example is the successful development of artificial skin that aimed to treat burn victims and patients with chronic skin wounds. Elaine Fuchs’ research on epidermal stem cells has provided critical insights into skin regeneration, which has informed the development of bioengineered skin substitutes (Baker, 2009; Gonzales and Fuchs, 2017; Gonzales et al., 2021; Hsu and Fuchs, 2022; Liu et al., 2023b; Yang et al., 2023; Tierney et al., 2024). The understanding of epidermal stem cells, their role in skin regeneration, along with the integration of a bioengineered scaffold, has led to the commercialization of artificial skins such as Integra® and Apligraf® (Gonzalez and Yuen, 2020; Dinh and Veves, 2006).",
        "While bioengineered skin has successfully reached the clinical market, researchers face persistent challenges when attempting to construct larger, more complex organs such as the heart or kidney. Whole organs consist of multicellular, vascularized tissue arranged in specific patterns. While multi-cell patterning and vascularization have been achieved in organoids (see Section 3.1.2), large-scale patterning remains difficult.",
        "One avenue to achieve complex cellular patterning in vitro is 3D bioprinting, which can be used to construct living tissues using bioinks composed of cells, hydrogels, and other biomaterials (Murphy and Atala, 2014). Recent advancements in 3D printing has led to printing of personalized cardiac patches by Noor et al. These patches are personalized using patient derived ECMs and are embedded with iPSCs (Noor et al., 2019). However, 3D printing has limitations. For one, printing a complex and living tissue is complicated and cannot accurately reflect the microenvironment of cells within the body. Additionally, challenges such as biocompatibility and biomaterial stability remain as obstacles to printing fully functional tissues. Despite these limitations, Lee et al. built a complex collagen scaffold that replicated the components of a human heart using a freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) (Lee et al., 2019). These FRESH 3D-bioprinted hearts replicated patient-specific heart anatomies from capillaries to the full organ itself (Lee et al., 2019).",
        "While tissue engineering has made significant improvements in developing functional tissues, including artificial skin and vascularized organoids, the goal of creating fully functional, transplantable organs remains a challenge. The integration of co-culturing methods, bioengineers, scaffolds, and vascularization techniques has laid groundwork for further advancements. Additionally, the emergence of 3D bioprinting as a tool for fabricating patient-specific tissues has opened new possibilities for personalized regenerative medicine.",
        "Recent clinical trials demonstrate the rapid progress in translating stem cell technologies into therapeutic applications, addressing critical challenges in regenerative medicine. High-profile trials in retinal repair, pancreatic islet transplantation, and cardiac regeneration illustrate how stem cell research is moving toward real-world clinical use. One of the most recent advances is BlueRock Therapeutics and its investigational stem cell therapy Bemdaneprocel for Parkinson’s disease. The treatment consists of implanting ESC-derived dopamine-producing neurons directly into the brains of patients. Their positive Phase I results show treatment tolerability, implanted cell survival, and motor function improvements. The therapy is now progressing to Phase III trials to assess efficacy and safety in a sham surgery-controlled study involving 102 patients with moderate Parkinson’s disease (Quazi, 2022; Molla and Bitew, 2024).",
        "A successful example of stem cell therapy for retinal diseases is the Phase I trial conducted by UC Davis Health. They demonstrated that autologous CD34+ stem cells isolated from bone marrow can be safely injected into the eyes of patients with retinitis pigmentosa. Four out of seven participants showed measurable improvements in vision, confirming safety and potential therapeutic benefits (News, 2024). Similarly, BlueRock Therapeutics LP, in collaboration with Opsis Therapeutics and FUJIFILM Cellular Dynamics, is conducting clinical trials on iPSC-derived photoreceptor therapies for retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa and cone-rod dystrophy (Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, 2024). Luxa Biotechnology LLC is also advancing its RPESC-RPE-4W retinal pigment epithelial stem cell therapy for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Early results from Luxa’s Phase 1/2a trial demonstrated significant vision improvements in patients with severe AMD, leading to the FDA granting the therapy Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation (Business Wire, 2025). In contrast, a separate trial funded by the Highway Program for Realization of Regenerative Medicine investigated iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell sheets in a patient with neovascular AMD. At 1 year post-transplantation, imaging confirmed the sheet remained intact. However, the patient’s best-corrected visual acuity showed no change, and cystoid macular edema persisted (Mandai et al., 2017). This highlights key differences in therapeutic approaches and outcomes between the cell suspension therapies and iPSC-derived sheet transplants for AMD subtypes.",
        "An innovative example of progress in pancreatic islet transplantation comes from several clinical trials exploring advanced approaches to treat type 1 diabetes (T1D). The Edmonton Protocol remains foundational, achieving glycemic control and insulin independence in many patients through hepatic portal vein transplantation of donor islets (Cayabyab et al., 2021). Vertex Pharmaceuticals is advancing stem cell-derived islets encapsulated in immune-protective devices, such as PEC-Encap™ and PEC-Direct™, which eliminate the need for immunosuppression while addressing challenges like fibrosis (Goetz and Schork, 2018; Commissioner O, 2024). In preclinical studies, Weill Cornell Medicine demonstrated that adding reprogrammed vascular endothelial cells (R-VECs) to subcutaneous islet transplants significantly improved graft survival and reversed diabetes in mice, laying the groundwork for safer and more durable transplantation methods (WCM Newsroom, 2025). These advancements highlight the potential of pancreatic islet transplantation to improve glycemic control and reduce insulin dependence, though challenges such as limited donor availability and immune rejection persist (Wang et al., 2024a).",
        "In a landmark clinical translation of stem cell therapies, researchers successfully generated patient-derived islets using chemically induced pluripotent stem cells and transplanted them into an abdominal site, achieving functional engraftment in a participant with diabetes. This approach restored exogenous insulin-independent glycemic control, with the patient maintaining stable blood glucose levels and meeting all pre-defined safety and efficacy endpoints at the 1-year follow-up (Wang et al., 2024b). This work highlights the potential of autologous stem cell-derived islet transplantation to provide durable insulin independence while addressing key challenges in cell manufacturing and immune compatibility.",
        "Cardiac regeneration has also seen significant advancements, with preclinical and early-phase trials of iPSC-derived cardiac patches demonstrating graft survival and functional integration in patients with end-stage heart failure (Miyagawa et al., 2022; Tempesta, 2025; European Medical Journal, 2025). These advanced cardiac patches are engineered with conductive materials, such as graphene oxide-modified scaffolds, and rely on promoting maturation and uniforming the conduction of cardiomyocytes to reduce post-transplant arrhythmias (Bois et al., 2025).",
        "Patients have been receiving hPSC-derived products since 2010, with 83 products undergoing testing in 115 clinical trials worldwide as of December 2024. Over 1,200 patients with 34 different conditions have been treated, receiving a cumulative dose of at least 190 billion cells and 200 billion platelets. These therapies have generally been safe and well-tolerated, even with long-term follow-up. The therapeutic landscape is expanding beyond Central Nervous System (CNS) and ocular applications to include immune, cardiac, and endocrine cell therapies, with promising efficacy data emerging for conditions like diabetes, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Challenges remain in designing ethical phase III trials and scaling manufacturing processes while ensuring sustainable pricing models (Kirkeby et al., 2025).",
        "Many biotechnology companies are extensively researching cell-based therapies, positioning them as transformative alternatives to traditional small-molecule treatments due to their ability to target complex biological systems with higher specificity and adaptability (Quazi, 2022; Molla and Bitew, 2024). This shows how the field is moving toward targeted approaches that focus on what cells need to thrive, such as avoiding immune rejection, getting proper blood supply, and maturing into functional tissue. By tackling these challenges, researchers are bringing us closer to translating lab breakthroughs into life-changing clinical treatments.",
        "Stem cell delivery strategies currently rely on two primary approaches: intravenous (i.v.) infusion and direct local administration into target organs. Systemic i. v. delivery offers non-invasive access to widespread tissues but suffers from poor cell survival due to immune clearance, entrapment in off-target organs (e.g., lungs), and limited retention at injury sites (Huerta et al., 2023; Bagno et al., 2022; Leibacher and Henschler, 2016). Local administration (e.g., intra-articular, intramyocardial) improves site-specific engraftment but risks invasive procedural complications, cell leakage, and uneven distribution within damaged tissues (Li et al., 2021a; Terrovitis et al., 2010; Ashammakhi et al., 2019). Both methods face persistent challenges in maintaining therapeutic cell populations and preventing off-target effects, which undermine clinical efficacy.",
        "Emerging backpack technology addresses these limitations by engineering cells with surface-conjugated biomaterials that enhance survival and precision. Backpacks can also incorporate targeting ligands (e.g., peptides binding to upregulated integrins in ischemic tissues) to improve site-specific retention, reducing off-target migration (Li et al., 2021b; Anselmo et al., 2015). By synergizing the scalability of i. v. delivery with the precision of localized administration, backpack-modified stem cells offer a transformative strategy to bridge the gap between preclinical promise and clinical reality.",
        "One interesting approach for targeted drug delivery is cell-mediated therapy, where the surface of living cells are engineered with ligands of interest (e.g., nanoparticles) to improve therapeutic potency (Polak et al., 2015). This engineering approach has been inspired by the mammalian pathogens hemotrophic mycoplasmas, which bind to the erythrocyte surface and can remain in circulation for several weeks. (Chambers and Mitragotri, 2004). The Backpack molecules, also known as “Cellular backpacks”, have shown promising applications especially in treating autoimmune diseases and enhancing tissue repair.",
        "Backpack molecules, pioneered by Dr. Samir Mitragotri, are disc-shaped microparticles engineered to adhere to immune cell surfaces (Kenry et al., 2022; Klyachko et al., 2017). These structures are typically comprised of multiple layers of carefully selected polymers, such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), with a specialized cell-adhesive layer (Kapate et al., 2023). The precise control of size and shape is critical in backpack design, as these parameters must be optimized to effectively trigger cellular responses without impeding normal cell function. This delicate balance allows backpacks to modulate immune cell behavior while maintaining the cell’s ability to navigate through tissues and perform its intended functions (Kapate et al., 2023; Kenry et al., 2022; Brenner et al., 2018).",
        "The defining characteristic of a Backpack molecule lies in its unique attachment mechanism to cells, but equally important is the synergistic relationship between the cell and the biomaterial. This cell-biomaterial complex functions as a unified treatment modality, where the components complement each other’s strengths. In some applications, the cell serves as a “stealth” carrier, effectively hiding the biomaterial and enhancing its biocompatibility (Figure 3), thereby improving circulation time and reducing immune recognition (Raghunathan et al., 2022; Fukuta et al., 2025) Alternatively, when the cell itself is the primary therapeutic agent, the attached biomaterial acts as a guide, leveraging its targeting features to direct the cell to specific tissues or disease sites (Caplan, 2017; Kapate et al., 2023). This symbiotic arrangement allows for more precise and effective treatments, combining the biological functions of cells with the engineered properties of biomaterials to create a versatile and potent therapeutic platform.",

        "Backpack molecules adhere to the cell surface without being internalized, enabling prolonged effects and sustained interactions. To enhance cell-specific adhesion, backpack molecules can be functionalized with a variety of targeting reagents, including antibodies (e.g., anti-CD45), peptides, aptamers, and small molecules [Refer to Table 1\n]. This versatile functionalization allows researchers to tailor backpack molecules for specific cell types or targets, significantly improving their precision and efficacy in various biomedical applications. The non-internalized attachment and the ability to incorporate diverse targeting moieties make backpack molecules a powerful tool in drug delivery (Anselmo et al., 2015), cell therapy, and tissue engineering (Shields et al., 2020), offering new possibilities for targeted interventions at the cellular level (Kapate et al., 2023). As discussed above, the versatility of backpack molecules has led to their application in various biomedical fields, each leveraging the unique cell-surface attachment mechanism to address specific therapeutic challenges. These applications can be broadly categorized into four main areas: targeting immune diseases, enhancing drug delivery, modulating immune responses, and promoting tissue repair.",
        "Backpack molecules, initially designed for immune cells, have expanded to include stem cells for targeted drug delivery. These structures attach to cell membranes, enhancing their therapeutic potential by leveraging their natural homing abilities.",
        "So far, endothelial progenitor stem cells have been used with this technology (Bui et al., 2022), but the potential integration of stem cells could open up new possibilities for treating various diseases, offering a promising frontier in therapeutic applications.",
        "When producing backpack molecules, there are multiple strategies that can be used to incorporate nanomaterials onto the cell surface. These include: adsorption onto cell membrane, internalization, maleimide–thiol covalent coupling, ligand-receptor interactions, covalent coupling, and internalization. The simplest method to create a backpack molecule is adsorption, since it involves a passive interaction between the nanomaterial and the surface of the cell. This method relies on electromagnetic interactions, which are usually mediated via hydrophobic interactions, van Der Waals forces, and hydrogen bonding (Takeuchi et al., 2021; Bell et al., 2023).",
        "Another method that doesn’t require extensive cell modification is by using ligand-receptor interactions. This strategy is advantageous for scaled-up production, as altering the attachment ligand allows the same molecules to attach to multiple cell types. On the other hand, caution must be used when identifying potential receptors. If the ligand is targeted to a widely-produced receptor, it can lead to the undesired accumulation of cells in other organs and promote teratoma formation in the case of stem cells due to their pluripotency (Meyer-Hermann, 2018).",
        "Covalent coupling involves the modification of both particle and cell to promote a stronger binding than either adsorption or ligand-induced binding. One of the most popular examples of this is by using thiol-reactive maleimide groups on the nanomaterial. This mechanism takes advantage of the presence of the thiol groups on the membrane surface of certain cell types (ej. T-Cells, RBS) to form a covalent bond. This thiol-mediated covalent bonding shows prolonged surface retention and avoided particle internalization (Caplan, 2017; Dou et al., 2009). Additionally, the stronger binding provided by covalent bonding limits the detachment and uptake of particles in non-target tissues.",
        "Another technique that has been used to produce Backpack molecules is the internalization of nanoparticles or “Trojan Horse” method (Choi et al., 2012). This technique uses the phagocytic nature of a cell to engulf a foreign nanomaterial. This method leaves the cell membrane unaltered and can potentially protect the nanoparticles from interacting with non-target tissue in-vivo (Anselmo and Mitragotri, 2014).",
        "The application of backpack technology in stem cell engineering faces several key challenges. Foremost is the need to create tailored backpack designs for different stem cell types without compromising their phenotype or essential characteristics. Ensuring the backpacks remain attached during cell differentiation and proliferation is equally crucial. Additionally, developing efficient, scalable production methods for clinical applications remains a significant hurdle.",
        "Looking ahead, the future of backpack technology in stem cell engineering holds exciting possibilities. A primary focus is the development of patient-specific backpack-stem cell combinations, with backpack payloads customized based on individual genetic profiles (Liu et al., 2024a). This approach could significantly advance personalized medicine. Future research could explore potential synergies between backpack-modified stem cells and other therapeutic modalities, such as small molecules or growth factors, which might enhance treatment efficacy (Caplan, 2017; Oduk et al., 2018). Furthermore, the integration of imaging agents into backpacks for real-time cell tracking could revolutionize our ability to monitor stem cell therapies in vivo (Gamage et al., 2021), providing crucial insights into cell behavior and treatment outcomes.",
        "A material designed to interact with biological systems, to evaluate, treat, or even substitute any organ or tissue in a living organism is considered a biomaterial. These types of materials have various applications in medicine and biomedicine (Meyer et al., 2019; Deng, 2017). In cell culture, hydrogel scaffolds are typically utilized as biomaterials and are designed to engage with biological organisms. As such, they are subject to certain standards: (i) Biocompatibility—the material’s ability to minimize immunological rejection and function harmoniously with the host; (ii) Adequate durability related to its intended function; (iii) Bioreabsorption capacity—the ability for the body to metabolize the material; (iv) Biodegradability, which refers to its potential for biological degradation; (v) Mechanical properties that are suitable for the stresses and deformations it may encounter (Hernandez et al., 2018).",
        "Hydrogels can be made of synthetic and natural materials (Zucker and Prendergast, 2020). In stem cell engineering, natural biomaterials are typically preferred for scaffold-cell interactions due to their specific molecular domains and architecture. Natural biomaterials can be either protein-based or polysaccharide-based. Protein-based biomaterials include bioactive molecules that replicate the extracellular environment, such as collagen, fibrin, gelatin, and keratin (Datta et al., 2020). Polysaccharide-based biomaterials are primarily derived from various sources: algae (e.g., alginate), animals (e.g., chitosan, hyaluronic acid), and other natural sources (Benalaya et al., 2024). For simplicity, we refer to “natural” biomaterials as minimally modified biological materials, while “synthetic” includes both artificial and significantly engineered naturally-sourced materials. Examples of natural biomaterials include collagen, fibrin, laminin, and alginate. Synthetic or engineered biomaterials include PEG-based hydrogels, PLLA, PLA, PLGA, PCL, and PVA. Some commercial products like Matrigel and Geltrex may contain both natural and synthetic components.",
        "Biomaterials influence cell behavior by providing mechanical, chemical, biological, and other environmental cues. In the case of stem cells, biomaterials can help maintain an undifferentiated state or push cells towards a specific lineage. One way biomaterials can assist in maintaining stem cell pluripotency in vitro is by mimicking the stem cell niche. For example, culturing human amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (hAFSCs) on soft hydrogels causes them to express higher levels of pluripotency markers (Wang et al., 2015), while growing MSCs on micro-patterned fibronectin restricts cell spreading and prevents spontaneous differentiation (Zhang and Kilian, 2013). With this technology, biomaterials can be used to standardize the secretome of MSCs for use in tissue engineering or for clinical applications [see (Wechsler et al., 2021) for review]. Recent advances highlight topography-guided engineering as a critical regulator: Nguyen et al. demonstrated that mesoscopic collagen architectures (e.g., islands vs. fibrillar networks) direct MSC fate by modulating cytoskeletal tension and YAP/TAZ signaling (Nguyen et al., 2023). Similarly, Xu et al. showed that substrates mimicking blastocyst geometry revert primed iPSCs to a naïve state, enhancing their differentiation plasticity through geometric activation of KLF4 and TFAP2C (Xu et al., 2024).",
        "In cases where differentiation is desired, environmental and mechanical cues provided by biomaterials can encourage stem cells towards specific lineages. For instance, hypoxia-mimicking hydrogels encourage MSCs to differentiate into chondrocytes (Sathy et al., 2019). Culturing iPSCs in soft (0.one to one kPa) 3D hydrogels mimicking pancreatic stiffness enhances pancreatic progenitor differentiation and glucose-responsive insulin secretion, while stiffer matrices bias cells toward non-endodermal fates (Anjum et al., 2016; Karbassi et al., 2020). Growth factors can also be incorporated to differentiate stem cells, as shown by the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs when grown in a bone morphogenetic protein-2 releasing scaffold (Anjum et al., 2016).",
        "Biomaterials are also useful for maturing iPSC-differentiated cells. Maturation is a critical step for using iPSC-derived cells in tissue engineering. It not only causes them to be closer in morphology and function to native cells, but using matured cells also lowers the risk of off-target tissue formation caused by incomplete differentiation. Maturity is especially important for iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, as these cells must be able to beat and respond to electrical signaling to match native heart tissues (Karbassi et al., 2020). To this end, several groups have utilized biomaterials to mature iPSC-cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Asaro et al. developed an electroconductive collagen-MXene (Ti3C2Tx) material that, when combined with an external electric field, resulted in iPSC-CMs with elongated cell morphologies and increased the expression of cx43 (Asaro et al., 2023). For synthetic biomaterials, Chun et al. created a synthetic polymer matrix from different ratios of poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and carboxylated PCL (cPCL). Their iPSC-CMs showed increased contractile ability (Chun et al., 2015). Recently, Iwón et al. used PCL and polyurethane nanofibrous mats to mature iPSC-CMs. Compared to traditional culture on polystyrene plates, the nanofibrous mats caused the iPSC-CMs to have increased CM morphology, gene, and protein expression (Iwoń et al., 2024).",
        "To have the desired impact on cell differentiation and maturation, the biomaterial composition, functionalization, and structure must all be carefully designed. The next sections review commonly-used biomaterials in stem cell engineering, as well as tissue engineering strategies for building complex structures.",
        "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a crucial component of the stem cell niche, as it can directly or indirectly influence the maintenance, proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation of stem cells. Various ECM molecules serve regulatory functions for different types of stem cells, and the ECM’s molecular composition can be precisely adjusted to create the most suitable niche for stem cells across various tissues. Engineered biomaterials that replicate the in vivo characteristics of the stem cell niche offer valuable in vitro tools for exploring the diverse roles played by the ECM and its molecular components in regulating stem cell behavior (Gattazzo et al., 2014).",
        "Significant advancements have been made in vascular tissue engineering and regenerative medicine over the past few decades, particularly with the development of biomaterials derived from ECM proteins. These biomaterials offer mechanical support and biochemical signals that influence vascular cell attachment, phenotype, and behavior. Initially, ECM-derived biomaterials were utilized as two-dimensional (2D) coatings to enhance cell adhesion on tissue culture polystyrene dishes. Subsequent developments have resulted in three-dimensional (3D) ECM-derived biomaterials that exhibit enhanced tunability, allowing them to more accurately mimic the dynamics, composition, and structure of native ECM (Wu et al., 2021).",
        "There are benefits to using a 2D hydrogel coating over a 2D plate culture. For example, their enhanced cell-cell interaction which allows them for more biologically relevant cellular behavior and communication (Caliari and Burdick, 2016). Additionally, hydrogels coatings are able to replicate the physical and biochemical properties of the ECM providing a more physiologically relevant environment for cells, which can influence their attachment, proliferation, and differentiation (Scheidecker et al., 2024; Johnson, 2008). Most common culture methods for stem cells employ 2D techniques using plastic, which fails to replicate in vivo environments.",
        "In comparison, 3D cultures have a significant advantage: they more accurately mimic the complex interactions that occur between cells and between cells and their surrounding environment (matrix) as they would in a living organism. When grown in 3D cultures, stem cells display enhanced viability, differentiation potential, and more accurate tissue-like behavior compared to traditional 2D cultures (Kapałczyńska et al., 2018). These unique characteristics make 3D-cultured stem cells particularly valuable for research and potential therapeutic applications (Ylostalo, 2020). Table 2. presents a comprehensive list of commonly used ECMs, along with their sources (natural or synthetic) and typical cell lines used with each biomaterial.",
        "Summary of some of the most commonly used biomaterials for culturing and co-culturing stem cells across various applications, from cell differentiation to disease modeling. [Refer to glossary for standardized cell line acronyms].",
        "The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a multifaceted role in cellular processes, influencing everything from cell adhesion to survival. In the field of tissue engineering, the application of ECM and ECM-mimicking scaffolds has led to split approaches: scaffold-based and scaffold-free methodologies. Scaffold-free techniques excel in generating consistent cell aggregates, offering significant potential for high-throughput, reproducible drug screening and disease modeling. However, the absence of ECM in these systems can hinder the survival and proliferation of certain cell types.",
        "To address this limitation, tissue engineers employ scaffolds that emulate the native ECM, resulting in organotypic models that demonstrate enhanced reliability in disease modeling. These scaffold-based approaches, while more physiologically relevant, come with trade-offs in terms of reproducibility and throughput compared to their scaffold-free counterparts. This dichotomy in tissue engineering approaches highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing physiological accuracy with experimental efficiency and reproducibility (Valdoz et al., 2021). Figure 4.",
        "Comparison of ECM scaffolds vs. 3D bioprinting: Balancing biomimicry and precision in tissue engineering. ECM scaffolds offer natural cell environments but lack structural control, while 3D bioprinting enables complex architectures but faces material and scalability challenges.",
        "3D bioprinting combines 3D printing principles with biological materials to create living tissue structures. This invention was pioneered by Dr. Hideo Kodama in 1981, though Chuck Hull is credited with filing the first patent for 3D printing in 1984 (RAISE3D, 2024). The first bioprinted cells were human embryonic stem cells in 2013. The concept gained significant attention when 3D printers became more accessible (Faulkner-Jones et al., 2013). Tal Dvir from Tel Aviv University is a notable researcher in the field, having printed a small-scale, cellularized model of the human heart, complete with chambers and major blood vessels, in 2019 (Cellink, 2025).",
        "Scaffold-free methods excel in generating uniform cell aggregates for high-throughput screening but often lack the mechanical and biochemical cues needed for long-term cell viability. Conversely, scaffold-based strategies leverage ECM-mimetic hydrogels to enhance physiological relevance, albeit with trade-offs in reproducibility (Valdoz et al., 2021). Recent advances in 3D bioprinting bridge this gap by enabling precise spatial patterning of stem cell-derived tissues with native-like cell densities and embedded functional architectures. For example, Skylar-Scott et al. (2019) demonstrated organ-specific bioprinting of cardiac patches with >10^8 cells/mL and perfusable vascular channels using sacrificial bioinks (Skylar-Scott et al., 2019), while their following work introduced orthogonal differentiation cues to pattern vascularized organoids within printed constructs (Skylar-Scott et al., 2022). Daly et al. further advanced this by fusing iPSC-derived spheroids in self-healing hydrogels, achieving high-density tissues with heterogeneous zonation (Daly et al., 2021).",
        "Three major approaches to creating 3D bioprinted materials are biomimicry, autonomous self-assembly, and mini-tissue building blocks.",
        "Biomimicry in 3D bioprinting aims to create precise replicas of cellular and extracellular components found in natural tissues or organs. This approach focuses on developing physiologically accurate biomaterials and gradients that closely mimic the native environment. To achieve success, biomimicry requires meticulous replication of biological tissues at the microscale level. This involves accurately reproducing the complex architecture of tissues, including the spatial arrangement of multiple cell types, the composition and structure of the extracellular matrix, and intricate networks of blood vessels and other supporting structures. By faithfully recreating these elements, biomimicry strives to produce functional tissue constructs that closely resemble their natural counterparts in both structure and function (Murphy and Atala, 2014; Ingber et al., 2006).",
        "Autonomous self-assembly draws inspiration from embryonic organ development processesThis approach often employs a ‘scaffold-free’ method, utilizing self-organizing cellular spheroids. This technique relies on harnessing the innate ability of cells to organize into complex structures as occurs during embryogenesis (Steer and Nigam, 2004). Successful implementation requires a deep understanding of the developmental mechanisms governing embryonic tissue formation and organogenesis. For successful self-assembly, bioprinted constructs must carefully control cell signaling, mechanical forces, and nutrient gradients. This approach aims to produce physiologically relevant tissue structures by allowing cells to guide their own organization, leading to functional tissue constructs (Murphy and Atala, 2014; Gonzalez and Yuen, 2020).",
        "Recent advancements in 3D bioprinting have focused on improving printing speed and cell viability. Gao et al. (2024) developed HITS-Bio (High-throughput Integrated Tissue Fabrication System for Bioprinting), a multiarray bioprinting technique that can position multiple spheroids simultaneously, achieving speeds ten times faster than existing methods while maintaining a greater than 90% cell viability (Kim et al., 2024a).",
        "The combination of peptide self-assembly and 3D printing is an important advancement in biomedical engineering (Farsheed et al., 2023; Irukuvarjula et al., 2025; Farsheed et al., 2024). This technology improves the accuracy and efficiency of creating biocompatible structures and opens up new opportunities for developing advanced medical devices and solutions in tissue engineering.",
        "The mini-tissues approach represents a sophisticated method for constructing complex biological structures by utilizing smaller, functional building blocks (Farsheed et al., 2023; Muir et al., 2022; Isik et al., 2023). This technique is grounded in the understanding that organs and tissues are composed of discrete, functional units, such as kidney nephrons. The primary goal is to build larger, more complex constructs through rational design, self-assembly, or a combination of both strategies. Two major approaches are employed 1) organizing many small, self-assembling cellular spheroids into one macro-tissue; 2) designing high-resolution tissue units into functional larger structures. Combinations of these strategies are likely necessary to successfully print 3D biological structures which combine functional, structural, and mechanical components (Gonzalez and Yuen, 2020; Business Wire, 2025). By leveraging the inherent organizational capabilities of cells and precise engineering techniques, the mini-tissues approach offers a promising pathway to creating more physiologically accurate and functionally complex tissue constructs.",
        "To achieve any of the techniques mentioned above, it’s necessary to think about the design of multi-component Bioinks. Multi-component bioinks are engineered to combine the beneficial properties of various biomaterials, enhancing the functionality and printability of 3D bioprinted constructs. They can be either natural or synthetic polymers but can be combined to create a bioink or granular hydrogels that can provide both biocompatibility and mechanical strength (Pan et al., 2021; Muir et al., 2022; Isik et al., 2023).",
        "Another way to create a Multi-component bioinks is to use a decellularized Extracellular Matrix (dECM). dECM-based bioinks are rich in bioactive proteins and factors, reducing the risk of immune rejection and providing a suitable environment for tissue regeneration. This can be translated into promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, closely mimicking the native ECM (Wan et al., 2024).",
        "To develop advanced bioinks for 3D printing complex tissues and organs it is important to incorporate bioactive molecules like growth factors, which are crucial for guiding cell behavior and promoting tissue formation, as well as control their release kinetics. Controlled release of bioactive molecules can be achieved through encapsulation in delivery vehicles such as nanoparticles, microparticles or even Small Extracellular Vesicles (sEVs) (Koons and Mikos, 2019; Kim et al., 2025; Kim G. et al. 2024b; Sjoerdsma et al., 2024). This approach not only preserves the bioactivity of the growth factors but also allows for controlled release over time, which is essential for tissue regeneration.",
        "Another strategy to create Bioinks is delivering growth factors by direct inclusion. Growth factors can be directly mixed with bioinks, although this method requires careful consideration of the printing conditions to maintain their bioactivity. For example, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) has been used in bioinks to stimulate bone growth (Potyondy et al., 2021). The direct inclusion of growth factors can expedite tissue regeneration by providing the necessary biochemical cues to the cells within the printed construct. Similar to growth factors, signaling molecules can be directly incorporated into bioinks to guide cell behavior (Saini et al., 2021). These molecules can include cytokines, chemokines, and other bioactive agents that promote specific cellular responses. The direct inclusion of these molecules ensures that they are uniformly distributed throughout the printed structure, providing a consistent environment for cell growth and differentiation (Saini et al., 2021). Nevertheless, one of the main challenges with direct inclusion is maintaining the bioactivity of the molecules during and after the printing process. Factors like shear stress, temperature, and pH changes during printing can affect the stability of these molecules. Additionally, the release kinetics of directly included molecules can be less controlled compared to encapsulated systems, potentially leading to a burst release that may not be optimal for long-term tissue regeneration.",
        "Recent advances in bioprinting technologies enable direct programming of stem cell-laden bioinks for spatially controlled differentiation, addressing key challenges in tissue complexity and functionality. For instance, the orthogonally induced differentiation (OID) platform uses transcription factor overexpression to bypass media-dependent cues, allowing co-differentiation of hiPSCs into endothelial cells and neurons for vascularized organoids (Skylar-Scott et al., 2022). Another example is the use of photo-crosslinkable ECM bioinks for 3D printing chambered cardiac organoids. These organoids feature a proliferation-first strategy, functional maturation, and perfusable geometry (Kupfer et al., 2020). These technologies overcome traditional limitations in cell density and spatial organization, showing potential for patient-specific models and organ repair. However, challenges remain in scaling cell production and achieving adult-like tissue maturity and size.",
        "4D printing represents a groundbreaking evolution in additive manufacturing, which integrates time into the design and functionality of printed objects as the “fourth” dimension. This technology uses smart materials that can transform their shape, properties, or functionality when exposed to stimuli like temperature, light, pH, or moisture. These transformations are pre-programmed into the material during the printing process, allowing for dynamic, adaptive structures with applications in personalized medicine, soft robotics, architecture, and textiles. However, challenges in material development, design, scalability, and durability must be addressed to fully realize the potential of 4D printing (Terrovitis et al., 2010; Ashammakhi et al., 2019).",
        "Emerging 4D bioprinting techniques, such as granular support baths that guide post-printing tissue maturation (Pramanick et al., 2025), now enable dynamic shape-morphing constructs that recapitulate developmental processes. These innovations address scalability challenges in scaffold-free systems while preserving ECM-like microenvironments, as seen in Brassard et al.’s bioprinted intestinal crypt-villus units. These units self-organize via Wnt/β-catenin gradients (Brassard et al., 2021). Together, these advances highlight a paradigm shift toward biomanufacturing of implantable tissues with clinically relevant cell densities and functionality.",
        "Traditional methods for 3D bioprinting face a trade-off between printability and a suitable cellular environment, compromising conditions necessary for cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and the achievement of high cellular density required for complex tissue engineering. Furthermore, they struggle to reliably reproduce physiological tissue-tissue interactions crucial for organ development (Lam et al., 2023). While stem cell-derived organoids are excellent at reproducing local tissue features, they typically cannot be grown beyond the millimeter scale and lack the architectural features of native organs. Previous bioprinting strategies, such as printing cell-only bioink inside support baths or printing biomaterial-based bioink inside self-healing hydrogels, have not provided the necessary environment for complex self-organization (Farsheed et al., 2024; Kelm et al., 2010).",
        "Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in the bioprinting of high-density stem cell-derived tissues. One notable approach involves the use of spheroid fusion within self-healing hydrogels (Daly et al., 2021). This method allows for the creation of heterogeneous tissue models with high cell densities, which is essential for replicating the complex cellular interactions found in native tissues. Additionally, there have been substantial contributions on the development of techniques for biomanufacturing organ-specific tissues with embedded vascular channels, significantly enhancing the scalability and functionality of bioprinted tissues (Skylar-Scott et al., 2019). Moreover, the potential of organoid bioprinting to recapitulate macro-scale tissue self-organization has been successfully demonstrated which is a critical capability for achieving tissue-specific hierarchies and functionalities (Brassard et al., 2021).",
        "The integration of these advanced bioprinting techniques holds significant promise for the development of functional tissue models with tissue-relevant cell densities. By combining strategies such as orthogonally induced differentiation with novel hydrogel matrices and vascularization techniques (Skylar-Scott et al., 2022), researchers can create complex, vascularized organoids that closely mimic native tissue structures and functions. These advancements not only enhance our understanding of tissue development and disease modeling but also pave the way for the creation of clinically viable implants and therapeutic tissue substitutes. As such, they represent a critical step forward in translating bioprinting technologies into practical medical applications.",
        "Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are nanoscale, lipid bilayer-bound vesicles secreted by cells into the extracellular environment. These vesicles play a pivotal role in intercellular communication by transferring bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and miRNAs between cells. sEVs are generally defined by their size, ranging from 30 to 150 nm in diameter, and their biogenesis, which involves the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that are subsequently released into the extracellular space upon fusion with the plasma membrane. This process differentiates sEVs from larger extracellular vesicle subtypes like microvesicles (100–1,000 nm), which bud directly from the plasma membrane (Gao et al., 2021; Nederveen et al., 2021; Jia et al., 2022). The term “exosomes” is often used interchangeably with sEVs; however, according to the Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV2018) guidelines, “exosomes” specifically refer to vesicles derived from MVB exocytosis. In contrast, “small extracellular vesicles” is a broader term encompassing all EVs within this size range, regardless of biogenesis. Molecular markers such as CD9, CD63, and CD81 are commonly used to identify sEVs and distinguish them from other EV subtypes (Moerkens et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2022a; Mozneb et al., 2024).",
        "The most prominent application of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in personalized medicine is their use as diagnostic markers. The molecular cargo of sEVs, which reflects the physiological or pathological state of their parent cells, makes them invaluable for non-invasive liquid biopsies. These biopsies can identify disease-specific biomarkers, enabling early diagnosis and prognosis. For example, miRNAs and proteins carried by sEVs serve as reliable indicators of tissue health or disease progression (Beetler et al., 2023; Goričar et al., 2021; Maniya et al., 2024).",
        "Beyond diagnostics, sEVs hold great promise as therapeutic delivery systems. Their natural biocompatibility and low immunogenicity compared to synthetic nanoparticles make them ideal carriers for therapeutic agents. sEVs can encapsulate drugs or genetic material and deliver them selectively to target cells, thereby minimizing systemic toxicity and enhancing treatment efficacy (Wang and Pan, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Furthermore, one of the most exciting applications of sEVs in stem cell engineering lies in their tailored therapeutic potential. By isolating and analyzing patient-specific sEV profiles from biological fluids, clinicians can identify unique molecular signatures that guide individualized treatment strategies. This approach enables the design of targeted therapies tailored to a patient’s specific needs and allows for the prediction of treatment responses, further advancing precision medicine (Lee et al., 2023; Carnino et al., 2021; Vinik et al., 2020; Tsering et al., 2024).",
        "sEVs also have the ability to create and modulate stem cell niches.",
        "Therefore, embedding stem cell-derived sEVs (SC-sEVs) into biomaterials can be used to develop scaffolds that closely mimic natural stem cell niches. These biomimetic scaffolds can release sEV cargo in a controlled manner, influencing stem cell differentiation and significantly enhancing tissue regeneration (Wu et al., 2022; Re et al., 2021; Swanson et al., 2020). Additionally, sEVs can be engineered to further expand their functionality within the niche. For instance, SC-sEVs can be designed to modulate immune responses by delivering anti-inflammatory molecules or promoting a reparative phenotype in immune cells, creating an environment conducive to healing and regeneration (Kumar et al., 2024; Karnas et al., 2023).",
        "Moreover, it is becoming increasingly reliable to tailor the cargo of stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (SC-sEVs) to address patient-specific needs (Tan et al., 2024; Crum et al., 2022). This progress paves the way for the development of not only personalized therapies but also highly effective regenerative treatments. However, while this approach holds great promise, it has not yet been widely explored in the context of SC-sEVs compared to other applications, such as cancer therapy (Kim et al., 2025; Qian et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2025; Joo et al., 2023). These customized approaches address unique pathological conditions while minimizing adverse effects, representing a significant step forward in precision medicine and regenerative therapy.",
        "Stem cells, particularly SSCs and iPSCs, are increasingly common in disease modeling and tissue engineering. They model hard-to-access cell varieties, provide a human-based alternative to mouse models for disease research and drug screening, and are used in organoids and tissue constructs. Simultaneously, stem cell based treatments are beginning their journey in the clinical sphere, with hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells assisting in the recovery of patients with blood cancers. As new therapeutic approaches emerge, it becomes increasingly crucial to engineer solutions to the concerns commonly associated with stem cells and stem cell treatments, specifically regarding safety and reproducibility. Safety in the context of tissue engineering means ensuring that iPSC and SSC-derived cells are fully differentiated, meaning they will not form unwanted tissues or teratomas, as well as guaranteeing that the cells are functionally mature. Repeatability, on the other hand, means addressing the effects of cell and donor origin on iPSC differentiation, confronting the variability of stem cell derived models in research, and confirming uniformity in treatments derived from stem cell outputs, such as the secretome of MSCs.",
        "One approach to these problems is to use biomaterials that are specifically tailored to stem cells and their desired applications. As more is learned about stem cell behavior in vivo, it becomes clear that they are heavily influenced by their surrounding environment. Biomaterials can be designed to provide the mechanical, chemical, and biological signals necessary to control stem cell maintenance and differentiation. This review highlights examples of biomaterials pushing stem cells towards a desired fate, increasing the maturity of derived cells, and increasing the uniformity of stem cell secreted factors.",
        "A bottom-up approach to biomaterials, in which biomaterials are designed with cellular needs as the guiding principle, becomes more feasible when taking into account the variety of biomaterials available and their tunability. Biomaterials can be tailored to specific stiffnesses, given functional groups, and combine natural and synthetic materials. They can further be modified to contain chemical and oxygen gradients. In this way, researchers can improve stem cell maintenance and differentiation by deliberately engineering their environmental cues. A biomaterial-based approach to stem cells is also appropriate when considering their use in engineered tissues. Several biomaterials can act as cellular scaffolds, be 3D printed into complex shapes, or be designed to facilitate tissue self-assembly.",
        "Conventionally, biomaterials for stem cell applications often focus on hydrogels. However, other innovative technologies can bridge stem cell engineering with translational medicine. These include using “backpack molecules” to host cells or the use of hydrogels with an external stimuli to facilitate the production of extracellular vesicles. In theory, a combination of these approaches could be used to deliver specific cargoes to promote cellular responses such as vascularization or tissue regeneration.",
        "For the field of regenerative medicine, stem cells represent a vast, untapped reservoir of potential. Although they have shown promise for tissue repair in vitro, few stem cell treatments have reached the clinical setting. The enduring vision of replacing damaged tissues with those grown from a patient’s own cells, or establishing a new route to tissue regeneration, has been hindered by variable stem cell differentiation and the difficulty of replicating complex systems in vitro. To bring stem cell products to patients demands a revolutionary change in the approach to differentiate stem cells and how to incorporate them into engineered tissues. Rather than a top-down approach that focuses on replicating specific tissues, we propose a bottom-up approach that focuses on creating biomaterials that support the differentiation and maturation of stem cells, then applying tissue engineering techniques such as 3D printing or self-assembly to confer structure.",
        "Our bottom-up strategy emphasizes the understanding of the intricate cues that influence stem cell behavior, enabling us to craft biomaterials that offer a tailored and adaptable environment. By incorporating engineered elements like sensitive linkages, peptides, growth factors, among other chemical and mechanical cues to the scaffolds and understanding their interaction with the stem cells, we can specifically design biomaterials to meet their needs, enhancing cell viability and scalability. This tailored strategy enhances the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies by offering a highly controlled and adaptable environment that optimizes cell function, paving the way for their advancement into clinical settings.",

        "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent a significant advancement in biotechnology, offering tremendous potential for cell therapy. iPSCs are created by reprogramming fully differentiated somatic cells into a pluripotent state, allowing them to differentiate into virtually any cell type.\n1\n This technology opens doors for treating various conditions, including as heart failure,\n2\n arthritis,\n3\n Parkinson's disease,\n4\n and spinal cord injury.\n5\n However, despite the promise of iPSC‐based therapies, cryopreservation remains a critical challenge that must be addressed to ensure the safety and efficacy of these treatments.",
        "Cryopreservation is essential for storing and transporting iPSC‐based therapies. The gold standard involves using 5%–10% (v/v) Dimethyl Sulfoxide (Me2SO) as a cryoprotective agent (CPA),\n6\n slow freezing, and storage in vapor‐phase liquid nitrogen. While effective, Me2SO is cytotoxic at temperatures above 0°C, necessitating its removal post‐thaw through centrifugation before administration. This process, common in cell banking, poses significant risks when applied to cell therapies intended for patient use.",
        "Intravenous administration of Me2SO is routine for therapies like Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)‐T cells and hematopoietic stem cell transfusions, but it carries potential risks. Most adverse events are minor, such as nausea and headaches, but rare fatalities have been reported.\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n The situation becomes even more complex with novel iPSC‐based therapies exploring alternative routes of administration, such as direct injections into the heart,\n10\n spine,\n5\n brain,\n11\n and eye.\n12\n Unfortunately, there is limited safety data for Me2SO use in these contexts, and in vitro studies suggest that even low concentrations of Me2SO can significantly reduce cell viability.\n13\n, \n14",
        "Given these risks, clinical and preclinical sponsors often remove Me2SO from the cell product post‐thaw through dilution, centrifugation, supernatant removal, and reconstitution in a saline buffer. This is typically a manual open process performed under aseptic conditions. While this procedure is standard in research settings, it introduces additional challenges, risks, and costs when performed at the point of care in cell therapy applications, which can be overcome by using Me2SO‐free cryopreservation media.",
        "In the US and EU, reconstitution of cell therapies falls outside the scope of GMP and occurs in hospital or treatment center pharmacies.\n15\n, \n16\n Open processing in pharmacy settings carries contamination risks. In the US, over 1000 contamination incidents occurred in compounding pharmacies from 2001 to 2013, some resulting in deaths.\n17",
        "Cell therapies are inherently complex and have high manufacturing failure rates, as high as 13%–25% for patients with hematologic malignancies receiving CAR‐T.\n18\n, \n19\n Simplifying the process by removing post‐thaw processing steps can potentially reduce overall risk of failure, improving product safety and availability.",
        "Cost is another key factor. Manual labor accounts for nearly 50% of the total cost of cell therapies.\n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n In the EU, cost barriers have already led manufacturers like bluebird bio to withdraw cell therapies due to reimbursement challenges.\n23",
        "Automated cell washing instruments exist, like the CliniMACs Prodigy (Miltenyi),\n24\n however they add significant cost such as the instrument itself, maintenance, qualification, validation, training, reagents and consumables which can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.\n25\n Thus, Me2SO‐free cryopreservation of cell therapies reduces risk of contamination due to open processing, reduces labor costs and simplifies the cell therapy administration, and reduces equipment expenditures on automated cell washing solutions.",
        "This mini‐review highlights the significant problem posed by current cryopreservation protocols for iPSC‐based cell therapy candidates, particularly the reliance on Me2SO. While iPSCs hold promise as a scalable and ethical source for off‐the‐shelf therapies, the risks associated with traditional cryopreservation methods threaten to undermine their potential. The issues with Me2SO, including cytotoxicity and the risks associated with its removal, emphasize the urgent need for alternative cryopreservation techniques. Exploring and developing these alternatives is crucial to ensuring the safety, efficacy, and widespread adoption of iPSC‐based therapies across various medical applications.",
        "A comprehensive analysis of iPSC‐based clinical trials, informed by two systematic reviews\n26\n, \n27\n and additional literature, examined 57 clinical trials to understand current cryopreservation practices. Among these trials, 32% (18/57) disclosed the use of Dimethyl Sulfoxide (Me2SO) as a cryoprotectant, and 9% (5/57) reported performing a post‐thaw wash step before administration (JPRN‐JMA‐IIA00384,\n4\n JPRN‐JMA‐IIA00385,\n4\n JPRN‐jRCTa031190228,\n5\n NCT06394232,\n12\n NCT03763136\n2\n). This post‐thaw washing and subsequent culture of the cell product are executed at the point of care, representing significant logistical challenges as they involve post‐processing, complicating the adoption of off‐the‐shelf cell therapies. Notably, 5% (3/57) of trials administered the iPSC‐based cell product fresh, following a culture period of up to 96 h post‐thaw and storage at 4–8°C before administration (JPRN‐JMA‐IIA00384,\n11\n JPRN‐JMA‐IIA00385,\n11\n JPRN‐jRCTa031190228\n5\n).",
        "The reliance on post‐thaw processing at the point of care underscores the current limitations of cryopreservation techniques, as the need for washing indicates potential safety concerns with Me2SO. A safe and effective Me2SO‐free cryopreservation media could eliminate the need for such steps, simplifying the workflow and reducing risks associated with contamination and product damage. However, a significant limitation of this meta‐analysis is that only 22% (13/57) of the clinical trials disclosed their cryopreservation protocols. To gain additional insights, a review of cryopreservation practices in preclinical studies involving iPSC‐based cell therapies was conducted.",
        "An extensive review of preclinical studies focusing on iPSC‐based cell therapies was conducted to explore cryopreservation practices. Using the search terms “iPSC” and “cryopreservation” on PubMed, 74 articles published between 2017 and 2024 were identified, and 12 preclinical studies were selected for analysis based on their use of iPSC‐derived cell therapies with therapeutic intent. The selected studies span various species and disease models, with a significant focus on administering iPSC‐derived cell products directly into the affected organ or tissue, presented in Table 1.",
        "Cryopreservation trends in preclinical iPSC‐based cell therapies.",
        "Note: Summary of preclinical studies on iPSC‐derived cell therapies across various species and disease models. The studies feature diverse administration routes, with the majority (75%, n = 9/12) delivering the cell product directly into the affected organ or tissue.",
        "The review reveals that all preclinical iPSC‐based cell therapy candidates (12/12) used Me2SO as a cryoprotectant. Additionally, 67% (8/12) of the studies employed a uniform freeze rate of 1°C/min, with the remainder not disclosing their freeze rate. Importantly, all studies (12/12) included a post‐thaw wash step to remove Me2SO, which introduces post‐processing at the point of care and represents a barrier to developing off‐the‐shelf cell therapies.",
        "These findings, summarized in Figure 1, highlight the consistent use of Me2SO across both clinical and preclinical studies, despite its associated risks and the logistical challenges of post‐thaw processing. The review underscores the need for innovation in cryopreservation techniques, particularly those that can support the development of off‐the‐shelf iPSC‐based therapies without the drawbacks of current methods. The limited disclosure of cryopreservation protocols in clinical studies further complicates efforts to establish product comparability, especially if preclinical processes are modified during clinical development. The ICH Q5 guideline stresses that any manufacturing changes potentially impacting product quality may require additional preclinical studies,\n39\n reinforcing the importance of early exploration of alternative, Me2SO‐free cryopreservation solutions.",
        "Cryopreservation trends in iPSC‐based preclinical studies. Trends in cryopreservation protocols across 12 preclinical studies involving iPSC‐derived cell products. The figure highlights the consistent use of Me2SO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) as a cryoprotectant and the prevalence of uniform freeze rates and post‐thaw washing procedures.",
        "Research on Me2SO‐free cryopreservation media for cell therapies is ongoing, with no clinical tests yet. Scientists are exploring combinations of FDA‐approved CPAs, including sugars, alcohols, and proteins, showing promising results and, in some cases, outperforming Me2SO. Machine learning has optimized a five‐component Me2SO‐free formulation, improving post‐thaw viability and reducing intracellular ice in iPSCs.\n40\n, \n41",
        "Ultrasonication with microbubbles has transported trehalose inside MSCs, overcoming its inability to penetrate cell membranes. This approach, using trehalose as a potent ice inhibitor, achieved post‐thaw viability comparable to DMSO.\n42",
        "Commercial Me2SO‐free media, like PrimeXV FreezIS DMSO‐free (FujiFilm), have shown safety in preclinical mouse studies.\n43\n Further improvements may come from refining freeze rates and multistep protocols.\n41\n, \n44\n Advancements in this field will require collaboration across disciplines, including formulation science, machine learning, and innovative cryoprotectant delivery techniques.",
        "In conclusion, while iPSC‐based therapies represent a groundbreaking advancement in biotechnology with the potential to revolutionize treatment for numerous diseases, the challenges associated with cryopreservation cannot be overlooked. This review has highlighted the pervasive reliance on Me2SO as a cryoprotectant in both clinical and preclinical studies, alongside the significant risks and logistical challenges it presents, particularly regarding post‐thaw processing. The consistent use of Me2SO, despite its cytotoxicity and the complications of its removal, underscores the critical need for innovative cryopreservation strategies that can eliminate these risks.",
        "The findings emphasize the urgency of developing alternative cryopreservation techniques that can safely and effectively preserve iPSC‐based therapies, enabling their widespread adoption as off‐the‐shelf treatments.",

        "The development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has opened vast opportunities for in vitro modeling of human biology and for cell therapy applications.1–5 Since the first reports of somatic cell reprogramming into mouse and human iPSCs in 2006 and 2007, respectively, iPSCs have been applied to model human development and diseases in vitro, screen drug candidates, and create cell therapies.1–5 Increasing understanding of the mechanisms that govern iPSC induction has shed light on cell fate decisions, accelerating the development of efficient iPSC derivation methods and protocols for iPSC differentiation into somatic cells.6 Modeling human biology with iPSCs and iPSC-derived cells is particularly attractive, given the human origin of iPSCs and the ability to derive patient-specific iPSCs with a disease-relevant genetic background.2 Indeed, iPSC-based cellular models may reveal human-specific phenotypes and molecular mechanisms that do not necessarily manifest in animal models.7–9 Furthermore, ever increasing complexity of iPSC-based cellular models has resulted in the development of sophisticated human-like tissues, such as organoids, that contain multiple cell types, exhibit primitive human tissue-like architecture and enable modeling of higher order cell-cell interactions.10 Various iPSC-derived cellular models can be applied to probe disease mechanisms, evaluate drug activity and toxicity, and develop next-generation cell therapies. Given that iPSCs can be genetically modified and differentiated into otherwise inaccessible cell types, autologous and allogeneic cell therapies are being actively developed using the iPSC technology and hold a great promise to provide new approaches for treating complex diseases.11",
        "In this review, we begin by outlining the historical development of the iPSC technology, including the key discoveries that led to the breakthrough of somatic cell reprogramming to iPSCs in 2006 and 2007.3–5 Subsequently, we summarize the key molecular and cellular events governing iPSC induction as well as the methods for somatic cell reprogramming to iPSCs. We then discuss the versatile applications of iPSCs, including in vitro modeling of human development and diseases, drug discovery, and cell therapy applications.",
        "Today, it is well established that most somatic cells harbor complete genetic information required for the development of an entire organism, whereas phenotypic diversity is achieved by epigenetic mechanisms that define gene expression potential in each cell.12–14 However, prior to such modern understanding of animal development, various hypotheses to explain how immense physiological complexity of an adult animal could emerge were contemplated. Popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, a theory of preformationism posited that animals would grow from miniature versions of themselves; the imagined homunculi were microscopic preformed human beings that would simply grow into their adult versions.15 As pioneering work in embryology accumulated and microscopy power improved, preformationism was gradually replaced by the theory of epigenesis, postulating sequential cell differentiation and organ development from an egg.16,17 Yet, it remained unclear how an egg cell could give rise to the breathtaking phenotypic diversity of somatic cells.",
        "In 1892, the German evolutionary biologist August Weismann (1834–1914) proposed the germ plasm theory, also known as the Weismann barrier, postulating that germ cells alone were used to transmit heritable information, whereas acquisition of somatic cell fate involved irreversible modification of heritable information, enabling phenotypic diversity to emerge.18 The idea of irreversible restriction of a differentiated somatic cell state during development was reiterated by the British developmental biologist Conrad Waddington (1905–1975) in 1957.19 Waddington proposed a model that would become known as the Waddington’s epigenetic landscape, suggesting that cell differentiation resembled a ball rolling downhill towards a more and more restricted and irreversible state.19 However, it remained elusive whether somatic cell differentiation truly required irreversible mutational events to occur or whether it could be achieved by some other means, such as by reversible epigenetic mechanisms.14 A year later, the American geneticist David Nanney (1925–2016) proposed that while the DNA sequence conferred gene expression potential, phenotypic differences in cells sharing the same genome could arise because of gene expression “specificities” regulated by epigenetic systems.20 Indeed, the reversibility of the mechanisms governing somatic cell specification was demonstrated by the British developmental biologist John Gurdon (b. 1933), who performed somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) experiments (Fig. 1a, b).21–25 In 1962, using a model of the Xenopus laevis frog, Gurdon demonstrated that a nucleus isolated from a terminally differentiated somatic cell and transplanted into an enucleated egg harbored all the genetic information required to give rise to germline-competent organisms.21–24 Therefore, the SCNT experiments revealed that genetic information was preserved during differentiation, whereas phenotypic diversity of somatic cells was likely achieved by reversible epigenetic mechanisms. What kind of epigenetic mechanisms could enable such elaborate yet reversible phenotypic diversity? Among the many layers of epigenetic regulation known today, DNA methylation is a prominent example of stable, yet reversible epigenetic memory acquired along the course of cell fate specification.26–29 For a historical review of discovering DNA methylation as a central mechanism of gene expression regulation and maintenance over mitotic divisions, the readers are referred to Tompkins, 2022.14Fig. 1Development of the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. a A timeline of key breakthroughs related to the iPSC technology. b (Top) Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) experiments were pioneered by John Gurdon in the African clawed frog.

Subsequently, Yamanaka and James Thomson independently reprogrammed human fibroblasts into iPSCs in 2007",

        "In 1981, British biologists Martin Evans (b. 1941) and Matthew Kaufman (1942–2013) as well as the American biologist Gail Martin (b. 1944) isolated mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that would serve as a reference point for subsequent somatic cell reprogramming experiments.30,31 Human ESCs were isolated by the American developmental biologist James Thomson (b. 1958) and colleagues in 1998.32 Cell fusion experiments of mouse33 and human34 ESCs with somatic cells revealed the capacity of the resulting heterokaryon for reprogramming to pluripotency, thus reaffirming the notion of cellular plasticity and somatic cell fate reversibility observed by Gurdon (Fig. 1b). Transdifferentiation experiments by ectopic expression of transcriptions factors further revealed the importance of transcription factors in establishing cell fate; for example, overexpression of the C/EBPα/β transcription factors was found to promote B cell reprogramming into macrophages.35–38 With ESCs as a reference point for features of pluripotency and an emerging understanding of how transcription factors orchestrated gene expression, the Japanese stem cell biologist Shinya Yamanaka (b. 1962) together with his postdoctoral fellow Kazutoshi Takahashi designed a series of somatic cell reprogramming experiments that would lead to the breakthrough development of mouse iPSCs in 2006 (Fig. 1c).4 Aiming to induce pluripotency in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), Takahashi and Yamanaka selected 24 potential reprogramming factors that included transcription factors known to be important for the ESC state and other effectors. The reprogramming factors were cloned into retroviral vectors for MEF transduction, whereas MEFs were engineered to carry β-galactosidase and neomycin resistance encoding genes under a pluripotency-specific promoter of the Fbxo15 gene. Screening different combination of the 24 reprogramming factors, Takahashi and Yamanaka narrowed down the list to four transcription factors that were sufficient to induce pluripotency in MEFs: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc (together known as OSKM or Yamanaka factors).4 Remarkably, these mouse iPSCs resembled the biological potency, gene expression, and the epigenetic landscape of ESCs.39 A year later, Yamanaka and Thomson independently demonstrated that human fibroblasts could also be reprogrammed into iPSCs; Yamanaka used the same OSKM factors, whereas Thomson used OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28.3,5 These combinations of reprogramming factors remain widely used today, whereas Gurdon and Yamanaka were awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries. Since 2007, various modifications to the original cocktail of reprogramming factors have been developed. For example, small-molecule assisted somatic cell reprogramming was first reported in 2008,40,41 whereas fully chemical reprogramming of murine fibroblasts using seven small-molecule compounds was achieved in 2013.42",
        "When pluripotent stem cells undergo differentiation into somatic cells, they acquire epigenetic memory and undergo global changes to their chromatin conformation, resulting in inactivation of pluripotency-specific genes and activation of somatic cell-specific genes.43 Reprogramming of somatic cells back to the pluripotency state involves the erasure of many of these somatic cell signatures; therefore, induction of pluripotency has been proposed to partially resemble the a sequence of developmental events in reverse.6,44–46 Broadly, reprogramming occurs in two phases, early and late. During the early phase, somatic genes are silenced, whereas early pluripotency-associated genes are activated; during the late phase, late pluripotency-associated genes are activated. Early events of reprogramming are largely stochastic, presumably owing to the inefficient access of closed chromatin by OSKM and other transcription factors, whereas late events appear to be more deterministic.6 Universal aspects of reprogramming, such as two transcriptional waves, are accompanied by somatic cell type-specific reprogramming trajectories and transient events.47 Overall, reprogramming entails profound remodeling of the chromatin structure and the epigenome as well as changes to almost every aspect of cell biology, including metabolism, cell signaling, intracellular transport, proteostasis, and others.48–52 Given that iPSCs are most often derived from fibroblasts, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) is another critical event that occurs during reprogramming.53",
        "Uncovering the molecular mechanisms of iPSC induction facilitates the development of novel reprogramming approaches and reveals the underlying principles of cell fate transitions and cell fate determination. This knowledge can subsequently be used to design rational strategies for iPSC differentiation towards the desired cell types in an efficient manner. In this section, we focus on the roles of transcription factors as well as chromatin and DNA methylation dynamics in reprogramming.",
        "OSKM and other transcription factors orchestrate somatic cell reprogramming to pluripotency.54,55 Through concerted action, OSKM expel somatic cell-specific transcription factors from somatic enhancers and activate pluripotency enhancers; silencing of somatic cell-specific enhancers is initiated early in reprogramming, whereas activation of pluripotency-specific enhancers occurs later in reprogramming.56,57 Notably, the chromatin and DNA methylation landscape is restrictive early in reprogramming, requiring pioneering activity of the OSKM factors to access closed chromatin and initiate gene expression.58 Oct4, Klf4, and Sox2 target partial motifs in the nucleosome-enriched loci, indicating their pioneering activity,55 whereas Sox2 has even been proposed to be a super pioneer due to its ability to induce DNA demethylation and overcome repressive epigenome.59 Multiple studies have revealed the dynamics of OSKM binding to DNA and their mode of action. For example, Oct4 dynamics exhibit a hierarchical sequence of events, with Oct4 targeting epigenetically primed states and then maintaining stable DNA occupancy for the duration of reprogramming.56 Mutagenesis-based analysis of Oct4 protein domains has revealed dynamic DNA and nucleosome binding kinetics and highlights the importance of stable Oct4 interactions with nucleosomes to maintain chromatin accessibility of pluripotency enhancers.60 Klf4 facilitates topological enhancer-promoter connectivity and organization required for reprogramming to pluripotency,61 whereas Myc targets open promoter regions to facilitate cell cycle progression.6,62,63 Importantly, OSKM closely cooperate with each other to exert global reprogramming of gene expression, which can be illustrated by the concerted action of OSKM to drive MET: Oct4 and Sox2 suppress Snail expression, Klf4 promotes Chd1 expression (encoding E-cadherin), and Myc suppresses the TGFβ signaling axis.64 In addition to OSKM, multiple other transcription factors play important roles in reprogramming downstream of OSKM and can partially substitute certain OSKM factors.65–69 For example, Klf4 and Sox2 can be substituted by their close homologs,6,70 whereas NKX3-1 or a dominant-negative variant of c-Jun can substitute Oct4.67,71 Notably, certain cell types that endogenously express SKM, such as neural progenitor cells, can be reprogrammed into iPSCs with exogenous expression of Oct4 alone.72–74 Overall, transcription factors are the drivers of somatic cell reprogramming to pluripotency that coordinate the rewiring of gene expression as well as the remodeling of chromatin and DNA methylation as discussed next.",
        "Chromatin remodeling represents another layer of dynamic changes that occur during reprogramming.44,75,76 Although pioneer transcription factors can access closed chromatin, the ability of non-pioneer transcription factors to exert gene expression programs requires extensive chromatin remodeling. Given that chromatin becomes progressively restricted during cell differentiation to establish somatic cell-specific gene expression programs,43 decompaction and remodeling of chromatin is essential for induction of pluripotency. Chromatin remodeling often precedes changes in gene expression and is required for establishing pluripotency-supporting spatial organization of DNA regulatory elements as well as for enabling access of transcription factors to DNA during reprogramming.45,77 Chromatin remodeling occurs in waves as loci enriched for somatic genes transition from open to closed early in reprogramming, whereas loci enriched for OSK motifs transition from closed to open late in reprogramming.75,78",
        "Chromatin dynamics are highly influenced by nucleosome remodeling and histone modifications that modulate chromatin compaction and transcription factor accessibility to DNA. Nucleosome remodeling factors, such as the NuRD complex and the histone chaperone CAF-1, exert context-dependent regulation of gene expression in somatic cells and during induction of pluripotency.79,80 For example, CAF-1 is required for maintaining somatic cell identity, whereas suppression of CAF-1 facilitates chromatin opening at enhancer regions and promotes Sox2-mediated activation of pluripotency genes.79 Various histone modifiers are also involved in reprogramming; for example, the histone methyltransferase EZH2 is a positive regulator of reprogramming, presumably required to silence somatic cell-specific genes.81 On the other hand, histone methyltransferase DOT1L is a negative regulator of reprogramming because it maintains permissive chromatin in fibroblast-specific genes associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.81 Changes in global levels of specific histone modifications have also been documented in reprogramming. For example, H3K9 methylation is depleted in iPSCs, and suppression of the H3K9 reader heterochromatin protein Cbx3 promotes fibroblast reprogramming to pluripotency.82,83 Global remodeling of histone modifications can be driven by metabolic reprogramming during the induction of pluripotency. For example, the transcription factor Glis1 targets glycolytic genes to enhance glycolytic flux during reprogramming, leading to increased production of acetyl-CoA and lactate intermediates required for histone acetylation and lactylation at pluripotency genes.84 Given the roles of histone modifiers in chromatin compaction and reprogramming, small-molecule compounds targeting histone modifiers are often used to promote chromatin decompaction during chemical or transcription factor-mediated reprogramming. For example, the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid as well as the Dot1l inhibitor SGC0946 promote somatic cell reprogramming to pluripotency.40,85,86",
        "Given the critical role of DNA methylation in establishing epigenetic memory during cell differentiation, active remodeling of DNA methylation is another essential part of reprogramming. In development, DNA cytosine methylation is orchestrated by de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A/B that guide DNA methylation at regulatory regions, thus modulating transcription factor accessibility and downstream gene expression.87,88 During reprogramming, such somatic cell-specific DNA methylation patterns are reversed by active DNA demethylation mediated by ten-eleven translocation (Tet) enzymes.89–91 Indeed, waves of global DNA demethylation during reprogramming result in the loss of DNA methylation at regulatory regions that become enriched for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an intermediate of Tet-mediated DNA demethylation.92–95 These actions of Tet enzymatic activity not only facilitate pluripotency-specific gene expression, but also drive other events required for reprogramming, including MET.96 Furthermore, Tet enzymes target specific loci to facilitate reprogramming; for example, Tet1 demethylates the endogenous Oct4 locus to reactivate Oct4 expression.97,98 Tet1 can even substitute exogenous Oct4 during reprogramming, indicating a central role for active DNA demethylation in reprogramming to pluripotency.98 Tet enzymes cooperate with pluripotency-specific transcription factors to reactivate pluripotency-specific genes. For example, Nanog physically interacts with Tet1 and Tet2, whereas cooperative binding of Nanog and Tet1 to loci of pluripotency-specific genes primes their expression during reprogramming.97 Tet1 activity is also influenced by exogenous vitamin C, indicating that small-molecule compounds can influence active DNA demethylation and epigenetic remodeling during reprogramming.99 Overall, remodeling of chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation erases somatic cell identity and creates a permissive epigenetic landscape for the pluripotency state during reprogramming.",
        "The dynamics of cell fate transitions at the population level reveal a stochastic and heterogenous nature of iPSC induction.76 Somatic cells transition through a continuum of reprogramming intermediates that bifurcate into intermediates that will successfully complete reprogramming and those that will acquire an alternative fate.100 Most cells do not complete reprogramming, whereas clonal competition leads to the emergence of dominant clones that overtake the culture during reprogramming.101 Clonal competition is also fueled by the heterogeneity of the starting somatic cell population, the extent of which may be dependent on the somatic cell source.101 There is a great interest in isolating rare intermediates that complete reprogramming more efficiently than do other cells, so that molecular mechanisms governing productive reprogramming could be elucidated.102 For example, rare intermediates that exhibit chromatin hyperaccessibility at pluripotency-specific genes and distinct DNA methylation profiles have been isolated based on the presence of pluripotency-specific surface markers.103 We anticipate that improving high-throughput profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility at single cell level will continue to provide new insights into cell fate transitions and reprogramming trajectories during iPSC induction.",
        "Although iPSCs resemble primary ESCs in terms of their cellular characteristics and the potential for differentiation into all lineages, limitations associated with reprogramming and persistent features of somatic cell identity render iPSCs distinct. Reprogramming of various somatic cell types reveals persistence of somatic cell transcriptional, DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility signatures.104–107 Incomplete removal of somatic cell-specific epigenetic signatures as well as aberrant de novo DNA methylation associated with reprogramming can affect the status and the differentiation potential of iPSCs.105,107,108 Adding small-molecule compounds that target chromatin modifiers to the reprogramming cocktail can facilitate the erasure of the residual chromatin signatures and increase the differentiation potential of iPSCs into alternative lineages.108 On the other hand, persistence of somatic cell-specific epigenetic signatures can be exploited to enhance iPSC differentiation into the desired cell type by deriving iPSCs from the same somatic cell type. For example, iPSCs derived from pancreatic beta cells retain open chromatin signatures at loci important for beta cell identity; consequently, beta cells can be differentiated more efficiently from beta cell-derived iPSCs as compared to non-beta-cell-derived iPSCs.104",
        "The cell source used for reprogramming can also influence the heterogeneity and the mutational burden of the resulting iPSCs. iPSCs derived from skin fibroblasts contain common ultraviolet (UV) light-related mutations and exhibit genomic heterogeneity, likely arising from the already heterogenous fibroblast population of the skin.109 On the contrary, iPSCs derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) do not exhibit UV-related damage and may have fewer mutations than do iPSCs derived from skin fibroblasts. Nonetheless, PBMC-derived iPSCs may contain other mutations that are selected for during reprogramming, such as oncogenic mutations in the BCOR gene encoding the BCL-6 corepressor.109 Age-related heteroplasmic variants of mitochondria can also influence the mitochondrial genetic makeup of iPSCs derived from different donors.110 Furthermore, spontaneous mutations that arise in the mitochondrial genome during reprogramming could result in the production of novel immunogenic epitopes; new iPSC-specific mitochondrial DNA mutations have been observed in >70% of iPSC lines.110,111 Overall, iPSCs exhibit increased heterogeneity as compared to ESCs due to persistent somatic cell signatures and mutational burden.112 Such heterogeneity can influence the quality of iPSCs, including their differentiation potential and the immunogenicity of iPSC-derived cellular products, among other features.",
        "Since the groundbreaking experiments of fibroblast reprogramming into iPSCs, various approaches to deliver reprogramming factors into somatic cells and induce pluripotency have been developed.113–115 Viral vectors carrying OSKM expression cassettes are commonly used for reprogramming due to their high efficiency of infection and the capacity to transduce various somatic cell types.3–5,113,115–119 Viral vectors can be classified as either integrating or non-integrating vectors; lentiviral or retroviral delivery of the reprogramming factors leads to their integration into the genome and thus stable expression for iPSC induction.3–5 However, viral vector integration into the genome may result in insertional mutagenesis and undesired transgene reactivation beyond the duration of reprogramming. An alternative approach is to use non-integrating viral vectors, such as adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, or Sendai virus.115,119 Non-integrating viral vectors are gradually cleared from proliferating iPSCs, resulting in reprogramming without permanent OSKM integration or disruption of the genome. OSKM factors can also be delivered using non-viral vectors, such as transposons,120,121 episomal plasmids,122,123 mRNA,124 and others.115 For example, plasmid-based episomal vectors are commonly used to derive iPSCs for clinical development; reprogramming efficiency when using episomal vectors is comparable to that of Sendai virus-mediated reprogramming, but the cost is much lower.122,123,125 Somatic cells can also be reprogrammed into iPSCs without OSKM overexpression. Various combinations of miRNAs can be used to activate the endogenous pluripotency gene networks.126,127 For example, human and mouse iPSCs can be derived by overexpression of miR-200c, miR-302s, and miR-369s.127 Alternatively, pluripotency can be induced using a cocktail of small-molecule compounds that modulate various signaling pathways and epigenetic modifiers.128 Small-molecule-based chemical reprogramming is highly attractive due to its simplicity and potential for scalability.128–130 Combining transcription factors and small-molecule compounds may further accelerate reprogramming.131–133 Overall, the desired method is often selected based on its efficiency, feasibility, safety, and cost.115",
        "It should be noted that new insights into the molecular mechanisms of reprogramming using the methods described above are constantly emerging. For example, chemical reprogramming is associated with distinct cell fate transitions and chromatin accessibility dynamics as compared to transcription factor-mediated reprogramming, but it remains unclear if such differences affect the status of the derived iPSCs.134,135 Furthermore, aberrant Oct4 off-target activity has been linked to changes in gene expression and epigenetic profiles that may alter the iPSC differentiation potential.136 Therefore, newly developed reprogramming methods should be rigorously assessed for their effects on the iPSC status, quality, and differentiation potential.",
        "Development of the iPSC technology has transformed in vitro research and therapeutic development.2,137 iPSCs can proliferate almost indefinitely and be differentiated into the diversity of human cell types, but with reduced ethical constraints as compared to using human ESCs.138,139 As a result, iPSC-derived cells are widely used for modeling human development and diseases, performing high-throughput drug screening, and developing autologous and allogeneic cell therapies, among other applications. In the rest of the review, we discuss the diverse applications of iPSCs, their key advantages, as well as the limitations that remain to be overcome.",
        "Assembling cellular models of human development and diseases in vitro requires access to large quantities of cells that faithfully recapitulate human biology. Although various primary cell types, such as skin, blood, and cancer cells, can be easily isolated from living donors, other cell types, such as brain and heart cells, are largely unavailable. An alternative approach is to use rodent cells; however, animal models exhibit substantial species divergence and may not recapitulate certain human-specific phenotypes.7–9 The iPSC technology can be used to overcome both limitations: iPSCs can be readily differentiated into hard-to-access cell types, whereas their human origin and relevant genetic background enable robust modeling of human biology in vitro.",
        "To date, hundreds of protocols to differentiate iPSCs into various cell types have been developed. This is often achieved by mimicking developmental signaling cues in vitro with relevant proteins and small-molecule compounds or by overexpression of cell fate-determining transcription factors to instruct the desired gene expression programs. Certain cell types, such as neurons or cardiomyocytes, can be differentiated with limited resources and training required in about one week.140,141 Other cell types, such as oligodendrocytes or T cells are more difficult to differentiate and require extensive technical expertise.142–144 For example, differentiation of oligodendrocytes, which arise late in human brain development, involves multiple stages, requires several different media formulations, and can take several months.143–145 Approaches for uncovering key effectors required for efficient cell differentiation include CRISPR/Cas9-based screens, temporal high-throughput profiling of differentiation trajectories, and comprehensive annotation of transcription factor activity, among others.146–149 In-depth understanding of developmental trajectories facilitates rational design of differentiation protocols to derive specific cell types and subtypes. For example, hematopoietic lineage cells can be derived by sequential specification of the mesoderm and the hemogenic endothelium to obtain hematopoietic progenitor cells followed by terminal differentiation of lymphoid and myeloid lineages in the presence of relevant cytokines.150,151 Neural cells can be derived by dual SMAD inhibition that promotes neuroectoderm specification and the emergence of neural progenitor cells (Fig. 2a).152,153 Furthermore, various morphogens can be applied to instruct regional identity of the differentiating neural cells to obtain specialized cell subtypes; for example, inhibition of the WNT signaling pathways specifies forebrain identity of neural cells.153 iPSC differentiation can also be considerably accelerated by ectopic expression of cell fate-determining transcription factors. For example, overexpression of six microglia fate-determining transcription factors facilitates rapid differentiation of iPSCs into microglia in as few as 8 days, as compared to several weeks required for microglia differentiation without the use of transcription factors.154Fig. 2Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cellular models. The iPSC technology can be applied to derive cellular models of varying complexity, ranging from two-dimensional mono-cultures to three-dimensional multicellular assemblies. Various neural cellular models are shown as an example. a Differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from iPSCs is achieved by promoting neuroectoderm specification by dual SMAD inhibition. Subsequently, NPCs can be differentiated into terminal neural lineage cells, such as neurons and astrocytes. b iPSC-derived cells can be maintained in a mono-culture or together with other cell types in a co-culture.

        "Cellular models of varying complexity can be assembled from iPSC-derived cells (Fig. 2b). A particular cell type can be studied in mono-culture experiments to evaluate the cellular response to experimental perturbations and uncover cell autonomous molecular mechanisms and phenotypes. Due to its simplicity, mono-culture is also often used to perform high-throughput screens, such as CRISPR/Cas9-based screens, high-content imaging, and drug screening.155–157 However, the mono-culture environment lacks heterotypic paracrine signaling and cell-cell interactions that are indispensable in vivo. To increase the complexity of iPSC-derived in vitro models, different cell types can be co-cultured together. Co-culture not only enables the study of cell-cell communication, but also promotes cell maturation. For example, co-culturing neurons with astrocytes enhances neuron maturation and survival because astrocytes provide neurotrophic factors required for neuron maintenance.140 Tri-culture of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia further increases the physiological relevance of the in vitro brain model, enabling complex phenotypes to emerge.158,159 Yet, co-culture experiments still lack the three-dimensional (3D) complexity and organization of human tissues. Remarkably, iPSCs have the capacity to self-organize into 3D tissues, known as organoids, if appropriate differentiation conditions are provided (Fig. 2c).10,160–164 Organoids are often comprised of several cell types and partially recapitulate the complexity of human tissues, enabling the study of context-dependent cell function, organogenesis, and organ-specific diseases. The organoid field has grown extensively in recent years, and dozens of protocols have been developed to derive organoids representing major human organs.10,160–164 Importantly, organoids can develop impressive complexity; brain organoids patterned by Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling exhibit human-like topographical specification with neocortical, ganglionic eminence, and hypothalamic regions.165 Kidney organoids contain nephron-like segments, including the Bowman’s capsule, proximal tubules, the loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubules in a continuous arrangement reflective of the human kidney architecture.166 Increasing sophistication of organoid differentiation protocols also enables derivation of organoids resembling specific organ regions. For example, exposure of developing neural organoids to various combinations of patterning morphogens yields cortical,167,168 midbrain,169,170 hippocampal,171 cerebellar,172,173 retinal,174–176 and other specialized brain organoids.177–180 Similarly, fundic and antral gastric organoids recapitulate distinct epithelial lining of the corpus and antrum regions of the stomach, respectively.181,182 Organoid complexity can be further increased by developing multi-lineage organoids or fusing heterotypic organoids to form assembloids (Fig. 2d).183–185 For example, multi-lineage neuromuscular organoids contain both neurons and skeletal muscle cells and thus form functional neuromuscular junctions.186 Similarly, fusing cortical organoids with spinal cord organoids and skeletal muscle spheroids results in the formation of corticofugal projections and innervation of the muscle tissue.187",
        "An alternative platform to self-organizing organoids is the organ-on-a-chip (OoC), a biomimetic assembly of tissue-relevant cell types into a microfluidics device to recapitulate certain aspects of tissue architecture.188–194 OoCs have separate compartments and are constantly perfused, enabling controlled tissue assembly, exposure to shear fluid forces, and separation of culture medium reservoirs. OoCs can be used to model tissue interfaces, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB)195,196 or the airway epithelium,197 where compartment separation is critical. Assembling iPSC-derived neural cells and brain microvascular endothelial-like cells (BMECs) into a BBB-on-a-chip yields a BBB model that exhibits in vivo-like transendothelial electrical resistance and restricted permeability.198 As a result, the BBB-on-a-chip can be perfused with whole human blood at the BMEC interface without inducing toxicity in the neural cell compartment.198 Microfluidics devices can also be designed to incorporate other functional elements, such as valves to support the mechanical function of cardiac tissue. Fabrication of a microfluidics system with valves has been used to establish an iPSC-derived heart-on-a-chip with unidirectional fluid flow and a closed pressure-volume loop.199 Heart-on-a-chip devices can record various parameters of cardiac function, including contractile dynamics, active force, tension, and electrical properties of the engineered tissue.200",
        "iPSC-derived cells and organoids can also be transplanted in vivo to obtain humanized animal models (Fig. 2c).201–205 In this way, the advantages of iPSC-derived cells, including their human origin and donor-specific genetic background, can be combined with the advantages of animal models, such as their physiological complexity, ability to exhibit cognitive phenotypes, and others. For example, transplantation of iPSC-derived microglia into the mouse brain leads to even distribution of microglia in the brain parenchyma, improved maturation, and long-term survival of microglia.206–210 Similarly, blood vessel organoids form perfusable vascular networks upon transplantation, which is challenging to achieve in vitro.211 Overall, iPSC-derived cellular models of varying complexity can be generated to address specific hypotheses of cellular function, cell-cell interactions, and tissue-level activity.",
        "Differentiation of iPSCs into various cellular models, especially in mono-culture, occurs with limited exposure of the differentiating cells to a physiologically-relevant tissue microenvironment and at an accelerated rate as compared to cell differentiation in vivo. As a result, iPSC-derived cells are often immature, which is a significant limitation of the iPSC technology to disease modeling and cell therapy applications. Immature cells lack complete functionality of their in vivo counterparts and thus may not reveal important phenotypes when used for disease modeling or be as efficacious as primary cells when used in cell therapy. For example, immature iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons exhibit fetal-like signatures, whereas expression of gene networks relevant to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) correlates with motor neuron maturation and aging; these observations suggest that immature iPSC-derived neurons may not fully recapitulate ALS pathology.212 Therefore, achieving robust maturation of iPSC-derived cells is an important consideration before downstream applications are pursued.",
        "Somatic cells differentiate and mature in the context of their tissue microenvironment that provides signaling cues, metabolites, and cell-cell contacts required for maturation. Reconstituting a physiologically-relevant environment in vitro can thus promote maturation of iPSC-derived cells. For example, artificial extracellular matrix composed of biomimetic nanofibers enhances cortical neuron morphological and functional maturation.213 Relevant paracrine signaling can also be provided by co-culture experiments, where two or more cell types interact with each other. Co-culture of cardiomyocytes with mesenchymal stem cells promotes myofibril alignment and gap junction formation in cardiomyocytes.214 Such enhanced cardiomyocyte maturation is partially mediated by mesenchymal stem cell secreted extracellular vesicles, highlighting the importance of paracrine cell-cell interactions that would be challenging to replicate using chemically defined cell culture medium alone.214 That cell-cell interactions promote maturation of iPSC-derived cells is also evident in 3D in vitro cellular assemblies, including organoids and OoCs that generally exhibit improved maturation over 2D cellular models. For example, incorporating cardiac fibroblasts into spheroids containing cardiomyocytes and epithelial cells leads to cardiomyocyte-fibroblast coupling via gap junctions as well as enhances sarcomere formation and cardiomyocyte eletrophysiological maturation.215 Similarly, a BBB-on-a-chip exhibits metabolic coupling between neurons and endothelial cells.216 Organoid maturation can be further improved by transplantation in vivo, leading to organoid vascularization, improved nutrient exchange, and exposure to physiologically-relevant systemic factors.217–223 For example, orthotopically transplanted lacrimal gland organoids functionally mature to produce tear-film proteins and resemble primary human tissue.217",
        "Somatic cells are also exposed to tissue-specific mechanical and environmental conditioning, which may be partially recreated in vitro. Application of mechanical stress to iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes by stretching improves their transcriptional and functional maturation.224,225 Incremental pulsatile stretching also promotes maturation of vascular grafts composed of iPSC-derived smooth muscle cells, leading to increased mechanical strength and minimized dilation of the engineered vessels.226 Fluid shear stress enhances ciliogenesis and maturation of multiciliated airway cells, whereas cardiomyocyte maturation can be further improved by electrical field conditioning.197,200,227 Overall, paracrine signaling and mechanical cues can be readily applied to achieve advanced maturation of iPSC-derived cells.",
        "Ultimately, iPSC-derived cells should faithfully recapitulate the cellular biology and function of their in vivo counterparts to serve as rigorous in vitro models of human development and diseases. Large omics datasets generated from primary human tissues can be used for benchmarking of iPSC-derived cells to determine their maturity and resemblance to primary cells. For example, Shin et al. performed spatial similarity mapping of single-cell transcriptomes of iPSC-derived thalamic organoids and primary human brain tissue, which revealed a strong resemblance of thalamic organoids to the primary thalamus.228 Therefore, efforts to generate multi-omics datasets of primary tissues, such as the Human Cell Atlas Project,229,230 can provide highly valuable data for iPSC-based studies and serve as a reference point for molecular profiles of functionally mature cells and tissues.",
        "Given that iPSCs resemble an ESC-like state after reprogramming,39 iPSC differentiation into somatic cells or organoids primarily recapitulates embryonic developmental and fetal-like cell states. Therefore, iPSCs are particularly suitable for modeling early human development. Controlled differentiation of iPSCs recapitulates key events of early embryogenesis, such as epiblast lumenogenesis, bipolar embryonic sac formation, and specification of the primitive streak and primordial germ cells.231–234 iPSC-derived primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) exhibit distinct germline-specific transcriptional programs and can be used to study germline development.232,234 Furthermore, differentiation of iPSCs towards presomitic mesoderm recapitulates human somitogenesis and the phenomenon of the segmentation clock.235 Recently, derivation of post-implantation human embryo models from ESCs has been reported.236 We anticipate that iPSCs will soon be applied to derive such sophisticated embryo models as well.237",
        "Although human iPSCs resemble the post-implantation epiblast, they can also be reprogrammed into naïve iPSCs that resemble the pre-implantation epiblast to study human embryogenesis before blastocyst implantation.238–240 Derivation of naïve human iPSCs from somatic cells was first reported in 2009 and generally requires a combination of transcription factors and small-molecule compounds that modulate various signaling pathways.240–242 Naïve iPSCs can be used to study X chromosome inactivation, dynamics of transposable element regulation, cell fate transitions, extraembryonic lineage differentiation, and other features and events of pre-implantation embryogenesis.240,243,244 Blastoid organoids have been recently developed from naïve iPSCs to study blastocyst development and implantation.245 In addition to naïve iPSCs, trophoblast stem cells can be derived from iPSCs to model placental development.246–248",
        "Differentiation of iPSCs into specific cell types reveals the principles of cell type specification and maturation. For example, profiling of dopaminergic neuron differentiation trajectories by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has indicated an important role for the ASCL1 transcription factor in dopaminergic neuron specification.249 Differentiation of multiple iPSC lines can also be used to conduct population level analyses, such as the quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis.250 In this way, gene regulatory mechanisms that play important roles in development may be uncovered. The organoid platform can be used to study the development of distinct organs. For example, temporal high-throughput profiling of brain organoid differentiation reveals transcriptional and epigenetic regulomes that orchestrate human brain development and regionalization of different brain areas.251,252 Spinal cord organoids recapitulate certain features of neural tube development by undergoing neurulation-like morphogenesis,253 whereas cardiac organoids co-cultured with epicardial-like cells mimic the envelopment of the myocardium by the epicardium that occurs during heart development.254 Finally, assembloids enable modeling of multi-tissue interactions that shape developmental programs through paracrine signaling and cell migration.255 For example, fusing anterior and posterior gut spheroids leads to the emergence of a hepato-biliary-pancreatic anlage-like structure at the interface of the two spheroids in a process that is regulated by retinoic acid signaling.256 Heterotypic brain assembloids, such as cortico-striatal assembloids, recapitulate interneuron migration that occurs during brain development as well as formation of long-range neuronal projections (Fig. 2d).187,257,258 Overall, modeling development with iPSC-derived cells can provide important insights into human-specific developmental programs and inform cell differentiation approaches for other applications as discussed next.",
        "The most common application of iPSC-derived cells is disease modeling.2,259,260 A key advantage of the iPSC technology for modeling human diseases is that iPSCs can be derived from somatic cells of patients afflicted with a particular disease and carrying causal disease mutations or genetic risk factors. Such iPSCs with a disease-relevant genetic background are subsequently differentiated into the affected cell types that can reveal disease-specific phenotypes. For example, neurons differentiated from iPSCs of patients with familial Alzheimer’s disease recapitulate amyloid β pathology, tau phosphorylation, and other phenotypes observed in Alzheimer’s disease patients.261–263 Alternatively, disease-relevant mutations can be introduced by CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing, which enables derivation of isogenic disease models.264 Isogenic cell lines can be generated by correcting disease-causing mutations in patient-derived iPSCs to obtain a wild-type control iPSC line.265 The resulting pair of patient-derived iPSCs and corrected control iPSCs shares the same genetic background except for the disease-causing mutation or genetic risk variant.265,266 For example, astrocytes derived from iPSCs of patients with Alexander’s disease reveal disease-specific phenotypes caused by GFAP mutations, whereas isogenic gene-corrected controls exhibit normal cellular function (Fig. 3a). Similarly, iPSC-derived astrocytes that carry the C variant of the rs11136000 SNP of the CLU gene, a known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, but not isogenic SNP-corrected controls, negatively affect oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) proliferation and myelination.267 Using isogenic cell lines limits confounding individual-to-individual variation and may increase the statistical power of in vitro experiments.268 On the other hand, derivation of iPSCs from large cohorts of patients enables genome-wide association studies (GWAS) combined with phenotypic analysis.269 For example, analysis of iPSC-derived cortical neurons derived from a large cohort of Alzheimer’s disease patients reveals single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with amyloid β production. Similarly, liver organoids derived from multiple donors reveal pleiotropic SNP interactions associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).269,270 These iPSC cohorts can also be used to perform high-content screening to rapidly detect and compare disease-relevant pathology as well as evaluate therapeutic candidates.271 Establishing iPSC biobanks that contain multiple iPSC lines representing different diseases is thus an important goal for advancing iPSC-based disease modeling.Fig. 3Disease modeling with iPSC-derived cells. a Genetic diseases, such as Alexander disease (AxD), can be modeled using patient-derived iPSCs that carry disease-causing mutations.144 A tissue biopsy is first taken from a patient with AxD. Somatic cells are reprogrammed into iPSCs, and the GFAP mutations that cause AxD are corrected by gene editing. Patient-derived iPSCs and isogenic corrected controls are then differentiated into astrocytes that express GFAP at high levels. Co-culture of AxD astrocytes with oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) reveals impaired OPC proliferation and oligodendrocyte (OL) myelination. Transcriptomic analysis indicates increased expression of the CHI3L1 gene, whereas OPC dysfunction can be partially reversed by CHI3L1 protein depletion. These observations in vitro can be further validated in primary human brain tissues as well as and experiments in vivo. b Sporadic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), can be modeled with patient-derived iPSCs that harbor genetic risk factors; alternatively, iPSC-derived cells can be exposed to non-genetic risk factors to induce disease-relevant pathology. For example, exposure of iPSC-derived brain organoids to human serum mimics the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and induces AD-like pathology. Brain organoids exposed to neurotoxic serum factors have increased levels of toxic amyloid peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau as well as exhibit impaired neuronal activity. c Infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, can be modeled by exposing iPSC-derived cells and organoids to viral pathogens. iPSC-based models of viral infection can reveal human-specific tropism, mechanisms of entry, and other features of a particular virus",

        "Given the multitude of disease modeling applications using iPSC-derived cells, the breadth of the relevant research could not be covered in a single review article. In the following sections, we consider several diseases that illustrate both the versatility of the iPSC platform as well as the different advantages and limitations of using iPSC-derived disease models. In particular, we discuss iPSC-based modeling of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases that are poorly recapitulated in animal models, require hard-to-access cell types, and can be age-related; cancer initiation that is difficult to study using primary cancer cell models that have already undergone transformation; and COVID-19 that illustrates rapid repurposing of iPSC-based cellular models to study a novel infectious disease during the height of a pandemic.",
        "Neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders are unique in that their pathogenesis manifests in cognitive changes that can only be studied using animal models that exhibit cognition, whereas in vitro experiments reveal molecular and cellular disease phenotypes only.272,273 However, neurological disorders, especially those that lack clear genetic etiology, cannot be easily recapitulated in animal models due to substantial species divergence and immense complexity of the human brain.274–277 These limitations have inevitably hindered scientific discovery and therapeutic development for neurological disorders. Nonetheless, iPSC-based cellular models can provide important insights into the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, whereas state-of-the-art technologies, such as brain organoid transplantation in vivo and machine learning, pave the way for studying complex cognitive phenotypes.",
        "Neural cells derived from iPSCs of patients with neurological disorders exhibit impaired cellular function.260,278 For example, cellular models of schizophrenia reveal aberrant proliferation and migration of neural progenitor cells, dysfunctional arborization of cortical interneurons, and impaired astrocyte glutamate uptake.279–283 Neural progenitor cells derived from iPSCs of patients with the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit increased proliferation and impaired migration, as well as increased DNA damage and dysregulated chromatin accessibility at the molecular level.284,285 Various assays can be used to assess neuronal network connectivity in cell culture, which is used as a proxy for cognitive dysfunction. Synaptic density can be evaluated by immunostaining, whereas electrophysiology experiments, such as multi-electrode array (MEA)-based assays, can be applied to measure neuronal activity.286–288 Neuronal cultures derived from iPSCs of patients with schizophrenia exhibit decreased synaptic puncta density, defective glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and molecular phenotypes related to synaptic dysfunction.289,290 On the contrary, neuronal cultures derived from iPSCs of patients with ASD exhibit increased synaptic puncta density and neuronal firing rate, indicating neuronal hyperexcitability.291 Recently, MEA has also been combined with machine learning to create simulated environments, where neural cell cultures perform complex tasks and undergo synaptic remodeling—an in vitro assay for learning.292,293 It will be interesting to determine whether neurons derived from iPSCs of patients with neurological disorders exhibit impaired synaptic remodeling in such simulated environments.",
        "Neurological disorders can also be modeled with brain organoids that can reveal dysfunctional cell-cell interactions and complex disease phenotypes.294–297 For example, brain organoids derived from iPSCs of patients with Down syndrome or ASD exhibit dysregulated proliferation of neural progenitor cells and aberrant production of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons.298,299 An important advantage of using brain organoids for the study of neurological disorders is their complex electrophysiological phenotypes that emerge as a result of improved neuronal maturation and 3D configuration.300,301 For example, cortical-ganglionic eminence assembloids derived from iPSCs of patients with Rett syndrome exhibit neuronal hyperexcitability and epileptiform-like activity characteristic of Rett syndrome.302 Finally, transplantation of iPSC-derived cells into the rodent brain allows the evaluation of cell behavior in a complex in vivo environment as well as cognitive dysfunction associated with the disease. For example, glial progenitor cells derived from iPSCs of patients with schizophrenia exhibit impaired astrocytic and oligodendrocytic differentiation, premature cell migration into the cortex, and hypomyelination.303 The chimeric mice also exhibit behavioral deficits, such as excessive anxiety, indicating higher-order neuronal network dysfunction.303 A powerful approach of iPSC-based modeling of neurological disorders is whole brain organoid transplantation in vivo, which not only creates a complex physiological milieu for the transplanted human cells, but also preserves human cell-specific organoid environment.218,220,222,223,304,305 Although neurological disorders have successfully been modeled using brain organoids in vitro, one important limitation of the brain organoid technology is their lack of vascularization, leading to poor nutrient and oxygen exchange, cellular stress, necrosis of the organoid core, and incomplete organoid maturation.306 Remarkably, brain organoid transplantation in vivo promotes robust organoid vascularization by the host vasculature and substantially improves organoid characteristics, including neuron maturation and microglia survival.218,220,222,223,304,305 An in vivo brain organoid model of Timothy syndrome reveals abnormal neuronal morphology and increased frequency of excitatory postsynaptic potentials, whereas a model of ASD indicates microglia activation.220,222 Overall, iPSC-derived cellular models of neurological disorders reveal complex molecular, cellular, and electrophysiological disease-related phenotypes.",
        "A distinct group of neurological disorders are age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, and others.307–310 In addition to various mutations and genetic risk factors, aging is a strong risk factor for such diseases and is tightly linked to their molecular mechanisms of progression.311–313 However, iPSC-derived cells are fetal-like and do not naturally exhibit aging-associated phenotypes.314,315 Somatic cell reprogramming to iPSCs is associated with cellular rejuvenation, causing the loss of aging-associated phenotypes, which are not restored upon iPSC differentiation.316,317 The lack of aging-associated phenotypes is a major limitation of iPSC-derived cells for disease modeling. Nonetheless, various iPSC-based models of neurodegenerative diseases have been developed, and methods to study age-related events or induce aging-associated phenotypes are emerging (Fig. 4).306,314,318,319Fig. 4Modeling aging-associated phenotypes with iPSC-derived cells. One important limitation of using iPSC-derived cells to model human diseases is their fetal-like phenotypes and the lack of aging-associated cellular features. The process of somatic cell reprogramming to iPSCs is associated with a nearly complete erasure of aging-associated epigenetic marks and phenotypes. Therefore, various strategies to induce aging-associated phenotypes in iPSC-derived cells have been developed. a Exposure of iPSC-derived cells to compounds that disrupt cellular homeostasis can be used to induce aging-associated phenotypes, such as mitochondrial stress or cellular senescence. For example, rotenone disrupts electron transfer in mitochondria, leading to an increased production of reactive oxygen species that can cause mitochondrial stress, damage other organelles, and induce cellular senescence. b Aging-associated phenotypes can also be induced by ectopic expression of progerin, a truncated variant of lamin A nuclear lamina protein. Progerin causes the Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a disease that manifests as accelerated aging due to the disruption of the nuclear lamina. Ectopic expression of progerin is sufficient to induce senescence- and aging-associated phenotypes in iPSC-derived neurons and other cells. c Aging-associated phenotypes are preserved if target cells are derived by direct transdifferentiation without an iPSC intermediate. Primary fibroblasts can be transdifferentiated into neurons that exhibit aging-associated phenotypes and epigenetic age signatures of the fibroblast donor, and can thus be used to study age-related dysfunction of neural cells",

        "A small proportion of cases of age-related neurodegenerative diseases are familial in nature and are driven by genetic mutations. Such causal mutations are highly penetrant and manifest in clear molecular and cellular phenotypes of iPSC-derived cells. For example, cortical neurons carrying mutations in the PSEN1 gene exhibit amyloid β pathology characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease262; dopaminergic neurons carrying mutations in the SNCA gene exhibit α-synuclein aggregation characteristic of Parkinson’s disease320; and motor neurons carrying mutations in the TDP-43 gene exhibit TDP-43 aggregation characteristic of ALS.321 However, most cases of neurodegenerative diseases are sporadic and do not have a clear etiology. Various genetic risk factors for sporadic neurodegenerative diseases have been identified through GWAS, and their subtle contributions to disease progression can be modeled with iPSC-derived cells.266,322–324 For example, the E4 variant of the APOE gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.324–326 Accordingly, iPSC-derived APOE4 neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, all exhibit dysregulated cellular homeostasis and function.266,327–331 Non-genetic effectors originating from outside the brain also influence progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Such effectors include the peripheral immune system that has recently been implicated in neurodegeneration as well as environmental factors, such as neurotoxins.332–336 For example, co-culture of iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons with isogenic primary T cells isolated from patients with Parkinson’s disease reveals increased neuronal cell death that is mediated by T cell-secreted IL-17.336 Furthermore, exposure of iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons to a neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) leads to increased expression of genes associated with Parkinson’s disease,334 whereas dopaminergic neurons carrying the A53T mutation in the SNCA gene are more susceptible to environmental pesticides than are normal controls.335 Finally, population level studies using large cohorts of iPSCs derived from patients with sporadic neurodegeneration may facilitate identification of novel biomarkers for patient stratification and reveal subtle genotype-phenotype relationships. Efforts to create disease-specific iPSC biobanks are underway; for example, hundreds of iPSC lines from patients with ALS have been established as part of the Answer ALS project.337,338 Interestingly, motor neurons derived from iPSCs of patients with sporadic ALS cluster into distinct groups based on their heterogenous phenotypes, illustrating the application of iPSC-derived cellular models to improve patient stratification.339",
        "The models described above, however, do not incorporate aging-associated disease phenotypes that play a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the lack of suitable models, it remains poorly defined how aging interacts with other risk factors to drive neurodegeneration. At the molecular level, aging may be associated with epigenetic erosion and DNA damage that derail homeostatic gene expression programs, resulting in suboptimal cellular phenotypes and cellular senescence.340–345 In iPSC-derived cells, aging-associated phenotypes, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, can be induced experimentally to mimic age-related cellular dysfunction (Fig. 4a). For example, iPSC-derived cells can be treated with rotenone that interferes with the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial damage, and disruption of cellular homeostasis.346–349 However, it remains unclear whether disrupting one cellular pathway is sufficient to recapitulate aging or whether it is simply a model of cellular stress.315 An alternative strategy to induce aging-associated phenotypes is based on overexpression of progerin, a truncated variant of a nuclear lamina intermediate filament lamin A.317 Progerin is integral in the pathogenesis of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a disease that causes premature aging.350 Remarkably, overexpression of progerin in iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons induces neurite degeneration, neuromelanin accumulation, and aging-associated gene expression.317 Although progerin overexpression can induce various cellular phenotypes associated with aging, it should be noted that HGPS is a distinct disease that may not necessarily recapitulate normal human aging and may exhibit HGPS-specific phenotypes that are irrelevant to neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, substantial efforts have been made to obtain human brain cell models without erasing aging-associated phenotypes of the somatic cells, from which the neural cells are derived. This aim can be achieved by direct transdifferentation of patient-derived fibroblasts into neurons without an iPSC intermediate (Fig. 4b).351–356 Fibroblasts can be transdifferentiated into neurons by overexpression of miRNAs or neuron fate-determining transcription factors, such as NGN2 and ASCL1, combined with a small-molecule treatment.354 Transdifferentiated neurons retain the epigenetic age and aging-associated phenotypes of the fibroblast donor and can be used to study the impact of aging on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.316 For example, transdifferentiated neurons derived from fibroblasts of elderly patients with Alzheimer’s disease reveal aberrant neuronal phenotypes, such as Warburg-like metabolic transformation, increased post-mitotic senescence, and hypo-mature neuronal identity, that are not observed in fetal-like iPSC-derived neurons.316,357,358 Finally, iPSC-derived cellular models can also be used to study age-related events by mimicking various cell non-autonomous conditions associated with aging. For example, breakdown of the BBB may be caused by aging and is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases, leading to leakage of potentially neurotoxic serum components into the neural tissue.359–363 Mimicking the BBB breakdown by exposure of iPSC-derived brain organoids to human serum induces a rapid onset of Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology, including accumulation of amyloid β and phosphorylated tau as well as impaired neuronal activity (Fig. 3b).364 We anticipate that novel approaches to induce aging-associated phenotypes and model age-related events using iPSC-derived cells will provide new insights into both neurodegenerative and other age-related diseases.",
        "Given their proliferative capacity, primary cancer cells derived from tumor biopsies are the most common cellular models for studying tumor cell biology and the response to therapeutic intervention.365–367 However, primary cancer cells have already undergone transformation, a key event that governs deregulation of cellular homeostasis and leads to cancer initiation.368 The iPSC technology offers a unique opportunity to study how various somatic mutations and other events rewire molecular and cellular programs of normal cells, so that they are transformed into cancer cells.369 For example, iPSC-derived neural stem cells carrying an H3.3K27M mutant histone H3.3 variant associated with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, a type of a juvenile brain tumor, exhibit aberrant gene expression programs that promote neural stem cell proliferation and stemness.370 Similarly, colonic organoids derived from iPSCs of patients carrying mutations in the APC gene associated with familial colorectal cancer exhibit elevated activity of the WNT signaling pathway and higher epithelial cell proliferation as compared to wild-type controls.371 In addition to somatic mutations, environmental factors also play a role in cell transformation. For example, chronic Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with increased incidence of gastric cancer, presumably due to persistent inflammation of the epithelial lining of the stomach.372,373 Injection of H. pylori bacteria into the lumen of iPSC-derived gastric organoids induces a rapid response of epithelial cells, including a twofold increase in cell proliferation.374 Finally, genetic manipulation of iPSCs and their subsequent differentiation into cancer-relevant cell types can be used to establish cancer evolution models that reflect successive acquisition of somatic mutations and clonal expansion of cancer cells. For example, introducing various driver mutations associated with acute myeloid leukemia into iPSCs followed by differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells enables modeling of leukemic transformation from premalignant cell states to transplantable leukemia.375 High-throughput profiling of gene expression across the continuum of leukemogenesis reveals distinct molecular pathways, such as dysregulated inflammatory signaling, that promote tumorigenesis.375 Overall, iPSC-based cellular models can provide important insights into molecular and cellular events governing cancer initiation, which may facilitate patient stratification for early screening and cancer prevention.",
        "Modeling viral infection with iPSC-derived cellular models can reveal unique interactions between viruses and human cells (Fig. 3c).288,376–379 The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has prompted the scientific community to rapidly repurpose experimental platforms, so that SARS-CoV-2 cellular tropism, molecular mechanisms of entry, life cycle, and SARS-CoV-2 targeting therapeutics could be investigated.380–382 Although animal cell lines and models permissive to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified and developed, human iPSC-derived cellular models have the advantage of revealing human-specific SARS-CoV-2 tropism and vulnerabilities.383–387 Therefore, iPSC-based cellular models of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been swiftly applied to study COVID-19, revealing disease-specific phenotypes.388 For example, SARS-CoV-2 infection of iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells cultured at air-liquid interface, a model for respiratory tract infection, induces cytotoxicity and a pro-inflammatory phenotype of AT2 cells.389 Co-culture of iPSC-derived macrophages and lung epithelial cells reveals a protective role of macrophages against the SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells; however, M1 and M2 polarized macrophages exhibit different inflammatory responses.390 Given widespread extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19,391–393 permissiveness of different tissues and organs to SARS-CoV-2 can be evaluated using tissue-specific organoids.388,394 For example, SARS-CoV-2 infects and productively replicates in salivary gland organoids, indicating the potential role for salivary glands as a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2.221 Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 actively replicates in capillary organoids, which may explain SARS-CoV-2-associated viremia.395,396 SARS-CoV-2 infection also induces cytotoxicity in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and cardiospheres, causing myofibrillar disruption, impaired cardiomyocyte beating, and cell death.397–399 Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have also been documented.400–402 SARS-CoV-2 infects iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells, neurons, astrocytes, and brain organoids.403–406 SARS-CoV-2 infection of neural tissues leads to increased tau hyperphosphorylation, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have long-term neurological effects that could contribute to the onset of neurodegeneration.403,407 Interestingly, the susceptibility of iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes to SARS-CoV-2 infection is dependent on the APOE variant; APOE4 cells exhibit increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to APOE3 cells.406 Overall, the iPSC technology has been rapidly adapted to investigate human-specific disease phenotypes of COVID-19, providing vital insights into this life-threatening disease.",
        "Various advantages of iPSC-derived cellular models discussed throughout this review are also applicable to drug development applications.408 Given their human origin, iPSC-derived cells can be used as a preclinical platform to test drug efficacy and toxicity as well as uncover human-specific molecular mechanisms of drug action. Various somatic cell types, including those that are inaccessible from primary sources, can be derived from disease-specific iPSCs that harbor relevant causal mutations or genetic risk variants to assess drug efficacy in the context of a specific genetic background. iPSC-based experiments can also be scaled to perform high-throughput drug screening with thousands of small-molecule candidates. For example, Gu et al. performed a survival screen of 4500 compounds based on the caspase 3/7 activity to identify anti-apoptotic compounds that limited death of endothelial cells derived from iPSCs of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.409 When combined with high-content imaging technologies, drug screening assays can be used to evaluate complex phenotypes, such as changes to cellular morphology or accumulation of disease-associated protein aggregates.271,410,411 Park et al. developed a high-throughput drug screening pipeline to evaluate amyloid β and tau pathology in brain organoids derived from iPSCs of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.271 In particular, the authors used tissue-clearing techniques and high-content imaging to visualize and quantify the burden of amyloid β and phosphorylated tau upon drug treatment.271 Combining iPSC-based drug screening with computational analyses and machine learning can reveal targetable regulatory nodes associated with a specific disease as well as therapeutic candidates for drug repurposing.412 Taubes et al. performed an in silico drug repurposing analysis to identify candidates that could reverse APOE4-associated gene expression signatures in Alzheimer’s disease.413 Having identified bumetanide as a potential candidate, the authors validated its efficacy in iPSC-derived APOE4 neurons.413 Furthermore, Theodoris et al. used machine learning to identify small-molecule compounds that could reverse aberrant gene expression associated with haploinsufficiency for the NOTCH1 gene in calcific aortic disease.414 The authors screened over 1500 predicted candidates using iPSC-derived endothelial cells and identified an inverse agonist of the estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) as a potent hit.414",
        "iPSC-derived cellular models can also be used to evaluate drug toxicity, which is a major cause of drug attrition in therapeutic development.415,416 Although preclinical toxicology is based on animal studies, human-specific drug toxicity may not necessarily manifest in animal models, leading to costly drug withdrawals late in the drug development pipeline. Therefore, the iPSC technology can be used as a complementary platform to assess drug toxicity and its human-specific molecular mechanisms.417–419 For example, drug nephrotoxicity may be evaluated using iPSC-derived podocytes that form the epithelial lining of the kidney glomerulus.420 A microfluidics-based glomerulus-on-a-chip recapitulates adriamycin-induced podocyte injury and albuminuria.421 Similarly, iPSC-derived 3D cardiac tissues recapitulate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, leading to disruption of sarcomeres and cessation of beating.422 Evaluating drug toxicity using patient-specific iPSCs may also facilitate precision medicine-driven patient stratification based on individual patient susceptibility to particular therapeutics. For example, transcriptomic analysis of a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes reveals patient-specific cardiomyocyte susceptibility to oxidative stress associated with decreased expression of the NFE2L2 gene.423 Cardiomyocytes with low NFE2L2 expression are more susceptible to tacrolimus- and rosiglitazone-mediated cardiotoxicity as compared to cardiomyocytes with high NFE2L2 expression.423 Uncovering the mechanisms of drug toxicity can facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate such toxicity. Sharma et al. found that exposure of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to cardiotoxic tyrosine kinase inhibitors leads to compensatory insulin signaling that may be cardioprotective.424 Indeed, adding exogenous insulin or IGF1 improves cardiomyocyte viability in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.424 Finally, drug toxicity can be elicited by unexpected drug distribution or accumulation in certain human tissues. Drug pharmacokinetics can be assessed in barrier-forming organoids, such as choroid plexus organoids that form fluid-filled cysts and exhibit selective permeability to various drugs.425 Drug absorption and metabolism by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family enzymes can be evaluated using iPSC-derived intestinal epithelial cells.426 Humanized animal models can also reveal human tissue-specific drug pharmacokinetics and accumulation; for example, transplantation of iPSC-derived kidney organoids into athymic rats has been used to evaluate organoid exposure to systemically administered drugs.427 Overall, the iPSC technology enables complementary evaluation of drug efficacy and toxicity using human-specific models.",
        "Cell therapy has recently emerged as a promising approach to repair or replace damaged tissue as well as engineer immune responses to a disease, such as cancer.428–433 The success of adoptive chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia and large B cell lymphoma has paved the way for developing novel cell therapies, including those based on the iPSC technology.11,434–436 Although primary cells, such as T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and mesenchymal stem cells, can be isolated from a patient and later used as autologous cell therapy, other cell types, such as neurons, cannot be harvested for transplantation. Furthermore, the quality of primary cells may be compromised by a disease or by germline mutations as well as exhibit unwanted heterogeneity. The iPSC technology can be used to overcome these limitations, given that iPSCs can be genetically engineered, clonally expanded, and differentiated into most somatic cell types.11 Furthermore, iPSC-based cell therapy has fewer ethical constraints as compared to ESC-based cell therapy because iPSCs are derived from somatic cells.437,438 Xenotransplantation experiments serve as a proof of principle that transplanted iPSC-derived cells can mitigate disease-associated tissue dysfunction and restore homeostasis. For example, transplanted human iPSC-derived pancreatic islets secrete insulin and control glycemia in diabetic mice439 and macaques.440 Similarly, human iPSC-derived OPCs rescue myelination in myelin-deficient mice upon transplantation, indicating the potential application of OPC-based cell therapy for treating demyelinating white matter disorders.123,145,441 These examples indicate that the iPSC technology can be used to derive hard-to-access cell types and restore normal tissue physiology upon transplantation. As a result, various clinical trials using iPSC-derived cellular products to treat human diseases have been initiated (Table 1).Table 1Selected interventional clinical trials of iPSC-based cell therapyOrganIndicationCell ProductPhaseStudy TypePrimary OutcomeLocationTrial IDBrainParkinson’s diseaseAllogeneic iPSC-derived dopaminergic progenitor cellsPhase I/IISingle-arm, open-labelSafety & graft expansionJapanJPRN-jRCT2090220384Allogeneic iPSC-derived dopaminergic progenitor cellsPhase IIISingle-arm, open-labelNon-rejection rateJapanJPRN-jRCT2091220385Autologous iPSC-derived dopaminergic progenitor cellsN/SCrossover, non-randomized, single-blindSafetyChinaNCT06145711Chronic ischemic strokeAllogeneic iPSC-derived neural progenitor cellsPhase ISingle-arm, open-labelSafetyChinaNCT06299033Acute ischemic strokeAllogeneic iPSC-derived endothelial progenitor cellsPhase IParallel, randomized, double-blindSafetyChinaNCT05993884Spinal cordSpinal cord injuryAllogeneic iPSC-derived neural progenitor cellsPhase I/IISingle-arm, open-labelSafetyJapanJPRN-jRCTa031190228EyesAge-related macular degenerationAllogeneic iPSC-derived RPE cellsN/SSingle-arm, open-labelSafetyJapanJPRN-UMIN000026003Autologous iPSC-derived RPE cell sheetN/SParallel, non-randomized, open-labelSafetyJapanJPRN-UMIN000011929Autologous iPSC-derived RPEPhase I/IISingle-arm, open-labelSafety & visual acuity changeUnited StatesNCT04339764Autologous iPSC-derived RPEPhase ISingle-arm, open-labelSafetyChinaNCT05445063Retinitis pigmentosaAllogeneic iPSC-derived retinal sheetsPhase ISingle-arm, open-labelSafety & increase in retinal thicknessJapanJPRN-jRCTa050200027RPE-related impairmentAllogeneic iPSC-derived RPE cellsPhase I/IISingle-arm, open-labelReduction of the window defect areaJapanJPRN-jRCTa050200122Bone marrowThrombocytopeniaAutologous iPSC-derived plateletsPhase ISingle arm, open-labelSafetyJapanJPRN-jRCTa050190117Acute myeloid leukemiaAllogeneic iPSC-derived NK cellsPhase ISequential, non-randomized, open-labelSafetyUnited StatesNCT04714372HeartCongenital heart diseaseAutologous iPSC-derived cardiac lineage cellsPhase IParallel, non-randomized, open-labelShort term safety & feasibilityUnited StatesNCT05647213Ischemic cardiomyopathyAllogeneic iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte sheetPhase ISingle-arm, open-labelSafety & improvement in LVEFJapanNCT04696328Heart failureAllogeneic iPSC-derived engineered human myocardiumPhase I/IISingle-arm, open-labelTarget heart wall thickness & heart wall thickening fractionGermanyNCT04396899Allogeneic iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte spheroidsPhase I/IISequential, non-randomized, open-labelSafetyJapanNCT04945018Allogeneic iPSC-derived cardiomyocytesPhase I/IIParallel, randomized, double-blindSafetyChinaNCT03763136Allogeneic iPSC-derived cardiomyocytesPhase IParallel, randomized, double-blindSafetyChinaNCT04982081LungsRespiratory failureAllogeneic iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cellsPhase IParallel, randomized, open-labelAssessment of respiratory dysfunctionAustraliaNCT04537351COVID-19 in patients with hypoxiaAllogeneic iPSC-derived NK cellsPhase ISequential, non-randomized, open-labelSafetyUnited StatesNCT04363346OvariesOvarian cancerAllogeneic iPSC-derived NK cellsPhase ISequential, non-randomized, open-labelSafetyUnited StatesNCT04630769SystemicSystemic lupus erythematosusAllogeneic iPSC-derived CAR NK cellsPhase ISequential, non-randomized, open-labelSafety & recommended phase II regimenUnited StatesNCT06255028B cell cancersAllogeneic iPSC-derived CAR NK cellsPhase ISequential, non-randomized, open-labelSafety & recommended phase II regimenUnited StatesNCT05336409Advanced solid tumorsAllogeneic iPSC-derived CAR T cellsPhase IParallel, non-randomized, open-labelSafetyUnited StatesNCT06241456Advanced solid tumorsAllogeneic iPSC-derived NK cellsPhase IParallel, non-randomized, open-labelSafetyUnited StatesNCT03841110Steroid-resistant acute GvHDAllogeneic iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cellsPhase ISequential, non-randomized, open-labelSafetyAustralia, United KingdomNCT02923375High-risk acute GvHDAllogeneic iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cellsPhase IIParallel, randomized, quadruple-blindOverall response rateUnited States, AustraliaNCT05643638CAR chimeric antigen receptor, COVID-19 coronavirus disease 2019, GvHD graft-versus-host disease, HIV human immunodeficiency virus, iPSCs induced pluripotent stem cells, LVEF left ventricular ejection fraction, N/S not specified, NK natural killer, RPE retinal pigment epithelium",

        "iPSC-based cell therapy can be divided into two categories—autologous and allogeneic (Fig. 5). In autologous cell therapy, iPSCs are derived from the same patient who will receive the cell transplant.442–444 Autologous cell therapy is meant to prevent immune rejection of the transplant by the recipient because the immune system recognizes the transplanted cells as “self” tissue. A tissue biopsy is first collected from the patient who will undergo autologous cell therapy, and the isolated somatic cells are reprogrammed into iPSCs. These iPSCs can then be genetically modified to correct undesired mutations or introduce new gene expression cassettes. For example, if a patient has a monogenic disease that is caused by a germline mutation, gene correction can be performed. After genetic modification, iPSCs are differentiated into the desired cellular product that will be used for transplantation. Extensive quality control of iPSCs and iPSC-derived cells is required to ensure that the cellular product is functional and does not contain any deleterious or tumorigenic mutations. The feasibility of gene correction-based autologous cell therapy has been demonstrated in preclinical animal models. For example, transplantation of hepatocytes derived from gene-corrected iPSCs of a patient with hereditary antithrombin deficiency leads to normalization of antithrombin levels in the plasma of antithrombin-lacking mice, thus mitigating the thrombophilic state.445 Similarly, transplantation of pancreatic beta cells derived from gene-corrected iPSCs of a patient with monogenic Wolfram syndrome restores normal glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice.446 A detailed example of preclinical development of iPSC-based autologous cell therapy for Canavan disease, a monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder, is shown in Fig. 6.Fig. 5Autologous and allogeneic iPSC-based cell therapy. In autologous cell therapy, somatic cells are collected from the patient who will receive the cell transplant. The isolated somatic cells are reprogrammed into iPSCs, which can then be genetically engineered to correct disease-associated mutations or introduce new gene expression vectors. Modified iPSCs are differentiated into the cellular product that will be transplanted into the patient and rigorously evaluated for quality. In allogeneic cell therapy, iPSCs are taken from a biobank and genetically engineered for immune cloaking. The resulting hypoimmunogenic universal donor iPSCs can be further genetically modified to introduce cell therapy-specific gene expression vectors, such as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) expression cassette, and then differentiated into the desired cell type. After rigorous quality assessment, cellular products can be stocked and distributed as off-the-shelf therapeutics for transplantation into multiple recipients. KO, knockout; KI, knockinFig. 6Development of iPSC-based autologous cell therapy. Despite the success of adoptive immune cell therapy, multiple other diseases affect cell types that cannot be easily isolated from patients for genetic engineering and transplantation back into the patient. For example, Canavan disease (CD) is a monogenic autosomal recessive neurological disorder caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene. These mutations disrupt ASPA enzymatic activity, leading to the accumulation of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the brain and causing spongy degeneration. ASPA enzymatic activity can be restored by transplantation of autologous neural progenitor cells (NPCs) that harbor CRISPR/Cas9-corrected ASPA or ectopically express wild-type ASPA delivered by lentiviral (LV) transduction. a A skin biopsy is obtained from a CD patient, and patient-specific iPSCs are derived from the isolated skin fibroblasts. b iPSCs are genetically engineered to restore wild-type ASPA expression and differentiated into NPCs that will be used for transplantation. c To demonstrate the efficacy of iPSC-derived NPC therapy for CD, preclinical experiments using a CD mouse model (Nur7) can be performed. CD mice exhibit characteristic spongy degeneration with vacuolation, myelin defects, and motor dysfunction. In our studies,122,123,441 we transplanted WT-ASPA-NPCs into the corpus callosum (CC), the subcortical region (SC), and the brainstem (BS) by stereotactic injection. We found that WT-ASPA-NPC-transplanted CD mice exhibited increased ASPA activity and reduced NAA levels, increased myelination and reduced vacuolation, and improved motor function.

        "In allogeneic cell therapy, iPSCs derived from a universal donor are used for transplantation, circumventing the lengthy and costly process of iPSC production from each patient who will receive the cell transplant (Fig. 5).447,448 The desired cells can be differentiated, characterized, and stocked in advance, so that the cellular product is available on demand or “off-the-shelf” without the need for in-house manufacturing. However, allogeneic cell therapy poses a risk of immune rejection and graft-versus-host disease, requiring additional “immune cloaking” strategies to evade the host immune system (Fig. 7a).449 Commonly used genetic modifications include knockout of the B2M gene, which encodes a component of human leukocyte antigen (HLA, also known as major histocompatibility complex, MHC) class I molecules, to disrupt foreign antigen presentation to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells; knockout of the CIITA gene to disrupt foreign antigen presentation to CD4+ helper T cells; overexpression of the B2M-HLA-E fusion construct to inhibit the “missing-self” response of NK cells; and overexpression of CD47 to provide the “don’t-eat-me” signal to macrophages.449 A combination of such modifications is often used to evade different immune cell types. For example, Wang et al. engineered hypoimmunogenic universal donor iPSCs by knocking out B2M, CIITA, and PVR (encoding a ligand for NK cell activation) as well as overexpressing B2M-HLA-E.450 Hu et al. also knocked out B2M and CIITA but instead overexpressed CD47, having observed that not only macrophages but also most IL-2 stimulated NK cells present the SIRPα receptor of CD47.451 It should be noted that extensive genetic engineering required for immune cloaking can introduce off-target mutations, whereas prolonged iPSC culture and clonal expansion can lead to accumulation of spontaneous genetic aberrations. In our recent study, we knocked out B2M and CIITA and took advantage of endogenously expressed CD47 in OPCs, our cell type of interest, to evade the NK response.441 Therefore, our approach requires two steps of genetic engineering only, reducing the likelihood of undesired mutational events. Having engineered the universal donor cells, their immune evasive properties can be validated in preclinical models. Universal donor cells and primary immune cells from an unrelated donor can be co-cultured together in vitro or co-injected in vivo to evaluate their survival and persistence (Fig. 7b).Fig. 7Engineering universal donor cells for allogeneic cell therapy. a Universal donor cells are genetically engineered to prevent the host immune response despite their foreign origin. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells recognize foreign cells via their T cell receptor (TCR) that interacts with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules presenting unique antigens. If a foreign antigen is presented by the HLA class I molecules, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells initiate destruction of the encountered cell. Knockout of the β2 microglobulin (B2M) gene is sufficient to disrupt the universal donor cell interaction with CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. However, ablation of HLA class I molecules elicits a “missing-self” response by natural killer (NK) cells, leading to cell lysis. Therefore, B2M knockout is often combined with ectopic expression of HLA-E, which interacts with the inhibitory NK cell receptor NKG2A/CD94 to suppress the missing-self response. Knockout of CIITA disrupts foreign antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells via HLA class II molecules. To prevent macrophage-mediated cell killing, CD47 surface protein can be ectopically expressed in universal donor cells. CD47 interacts with the signal-regulatory protein α (SIRPα) and acts as the “don’t-eat-me” signal to suppress macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. b Hypoimmunogenicity of universal donor cells can be tested by performing in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity assays, in which universal donor cells are mixed with primary immune cells, such as T cells, derived from an unrelated donor. Universal donor cells exhibit increased survival and stable persistence in the presence of primary immune cells of a mismatched donor, indicating successful immune evasion",

        "An alternative approach to prevent immune rejection of allogeneic cell therapy is to establish HLA-homozygous iPSC haplobanks to match the donor-patient genotypes of the main HLA molecules involved in immune rejection.452–455 Several dozens of iPSC lines are sufficient to cover a large proportion of the population by HLA matching. For example, Yoshida et al. established a clinical-grade HLA haplobank of 27 iPSC lines derived from 7 donors, theoretically covering 40% of the Japanese population for HLA-matched iPSCs.455 Overall, allogeneic cell therapy holds great promise to streamline the production pipeline, but the safety concerns, especially those related to immune rejection, remain to be fully addressed.",
        "Compared to pharmacological therapy, cell therapy is extremely complex and poses major safety, quality assurance, and logistical challenges, including those specific to iPSC-based therapeutics.456,457 A major concern is the propensity of iPSCs for teratoma formation; it is critical to ensure that undifferentiated iPSCs and stem cell-like intermediates are completely removed from the cellular product that will be transplanted into the patient to prevent tumor formation.458 Residual iPSCs can be removed from differentiated cell cultures by selective elimination of highly proliferative cells using chemotherapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin,459 or by selective elimination of alkaline phosphatase-positive cells using toxic substrates of alkaline phosphatase.460 Introducing a gene encoding a self-destruction switch can provide an additional safety mechanism to selectively remove transplanted cells if they acquire tumorigenic properties.461 Such self-destruction systems include inducible activation of apoptosis, expression of enzymes that can convert non-toxic substrates into toxic compounds, and expression of surface receptors that can be targeted by infusion of monoclonal antibodies.461 As discussed earlier, iPSCs can also exhibit higher intrinsic genetic heterogeneity as compared to ESCs, and acquire mutations during reprogramming, prolonged culture, and gene editing.111,462,463 Such mutations may confer tumorigenic potential or lead to the emergence of novel immunogenic epitopes. Therefore, genetic analysis may be required at different stages of iPSC preparation to ensure that the cellular product is free of deleterious mutations.",
        "Incomplete maturation of iPSC-derived cells remains a major hurdle in developing efficacious cell therapies. For example, iPSC-derived CAR T cells are often not as functional as CAR T cells derived from primary T cells, which may limit their tumor cell killing ability and persistence.431,464 Various approaches to improve iPSC differentiation and maturation protocols for cell therapy applications are under active investigation. For example, T cells can be differentiated using hematopoietic or thymic organoids that mimic the in vivo environment of the developing T cells.465–467 Challenges associated with efficacy of iPSC-based cell therapy for solid tissues include poor transplant engraftment and limited therapeutic response. Systemic infusion of cellular therapeutics may not be sufficient to establish a solid organ graft or may result in off-target engraftment.456 For example, intrasplenic infusion of iPSC-derived hepatocytes leads to their engraftment into various organs, including the liver, stomach, spleen, and large intestine.468 Engraftment can be controlled by using biomimetic scaffolds to differentiate cells as structured assemblies, followed by their direct transplantation into the recipient organ. Transplantation of iPSC-derived hepatocytes as a cell sheet generated using a supportive membrane promotes successful liver engraftment with no cells detected in other organs.468 Biodegradable scaffolds also promote integration and improve functionality of iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelium patches as compared to epithelial cells cultured and transplanted without a scaffold.469 Similarly, bio-ink polymers with favorable rheological properties support osteogenic differentiation of iPSC-derived mesenchymal stromal cells and promote repair of cranial defects upon transplantation into a mouse model of cranial injury.470 Combination therapy can also improve the efficacy of iPSC-based cell therapy via synergistic mechanisms. For example, a combination therapy of iPSC-derived NK cells and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy synergize to kill tumor cells.471 Similarly, a combination therapy of the neurotrophic factor GDNF and iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons to treat Parkinson’s disease results in brain-wide dopaminergic neuron innervation in a rat model, whereas transplantation of dopaminergic neurons alone is associated with poor long-distance innervation.472",
        "Logistics, reproducibility, and the overall cost of iPSC-based cell therapies should also be considered. Logistical challenges include manufacturing and quality assurance of iPSC-based cell therapies.457 Off-the-shelf iPSC-derived cellular products for allogeneic cell therapy can be generated and distributed in a centralized manner, whereas autologous cell therapies might require hospital-affiliated personnel and facilities to routinely generate cellular products compliant with good manufacturing practices (GMP).473 Reproducibility and consistency of iPSC-derived cellular products can be improved by automating cell culture with liquid-handling robots, whereas large-scale differentiation of iPSCs can be achieved by using bioreactors. Stirred-tank bioreactors enable the scaling of suspension culture as well as monitoring of cell growth and various biophysical parameters, such as pH.474,475 Automation as well as optimization of iPSC derivation, maintenance, and differentiation protocols can also reduce the overall costs of iPSC-based cell therapies. For example, developing growth factor-free media formulations that do not require costly recombinant proteins could make iPSC maintenance more cost-effective.476 Although various challenges remain to be overcome, iPSC-based cell therapy holds great promise to restore tissue homeostasis and function in a way that cannot be achieved with pharmacological therapy.",
        "Since its development less than two decades ago, the iPSC platform has opened new frontiers for scientific discovery and therapeutic development. The study of somatic cell reprogramming has revealed immense complexity of cellular transformation that occurs during the induction of the pluripotent stem cell state and encompasses both deterministic and stochastic elements.6 These mechanisms have shed light on the central role of transcription factors in orchestrating gene expression programs, the importance of epigenetic regulation of cell fate, and the cooperative nature of different effectors of reprogramming. With increasing understanding of reprogramming mechanisms, novel methods for efficient and cost-effective derivation of iPSCs continue to emerge. For example, recent reports of fully chemical iPSC derivation methods hold promise for the development of fully defined, scalable, and rapid somatic cell reprogramming protocols.128–130",
        "As in vitro models of human development, iPSCs and iPSC-derived cells have been used to investigate the principles and mechanisms of cell fate transitions, self-organization, and developmental disorders. Furthermore, iPSC-based cellular models for numerous other diseases, ranging from genetic to sporadic and age-related disorders, enable the study of human-specific disease mechanisms and the testing of potential therapeutic candidates in vitro.2 Sophisticated cellular models, including organs-on-a-chip, organoids, assembloids, and others, can be used to study higher-order tissue architecture, compartmentalization, and long-range interactions in human development and diseases.10,160,163,188,477 These advanced models of human tissues can also be used to evaluate drug efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics, thus serving as an additional preclinical platform for drug screening.408 We anticipate that the complexity and functional maturation of iPSC-derived cells and tissues will continue to improve and will reveal yet unappreciated mechanisms and phenotypes of human biology. For example, emerging methods for brain organoid transplantation and vascularization pave the way for obtaining highly functional and mature human cell-based neural tissues that can integrate into the host circuitry and influence animal behavior.218,220,222 Such models enable the study of neuronal network connectivity and its dysfunction in human-specific neurodevelopmental disorders that are challenging to reproduce in preclinical models.",
        "Finally, the promise of the iPSC-based cell therapy has substantially materialized in the past decade, with numerous preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials being conducted across the spectrum of human diseases (Table 1).11 These efforts are focused on various cancers, for which autologous and allogeneic iPSC-based immune cell therapies are being developed, genetic developmental disorders that require cell transplantation to restore tissue homeostasis, and even sporadic age-related diseases to replace degenerating tissues. Of notable interest are allogeneic cell therapies that utilize universal donor cells engineered to evade immune rejection.448 Universal donor cells can be prepared, characterized, and stocked in advance, considerably simplifying the manufacturing pipeline and reducing the turnaround time. Although important challenges associated with iPSC-based cell therapy remain to be resolved, the technology holds great promise to alleviate human diseases.",
        "The technological advances that evolve alongside the iPSC technology offer new opportunities to define molecular mechanisms of iPSC induction, optimize protocols of iPSC differentiation into somatic cells, develop sophisticated drug screening platforms, and create efficacious cell therapies. We anticipate that improving technologies, such as microscopy tools,478,479 multiomics,480 CRISPR/Cas9-based studies of gene and protein function,481–484 epigenetic engineering,485–488 machine learning algorithms,489–492 and others, will provide new insights into the molecular events that govern somatic cell reprogramming to pluripotency and iPSC differentiation into terminal somatic cell types. The study of human development and diseases using iPSC-based models will benefit from enhanced collaboration, including the development of deeply characterized benchmark iPSC lines493 as well as ethnically diverse iPSC biobanks.494 Automation of iPSC differentiation into somatic cells and organoids will increase reproducibility of in vitro studies required for rigorous high-throughput applications, including drug screening.495 Finally, improving iPSC differentiation and maturation protocols will enable derivation of efficacious cellular products for therapeutic development, whereas production of entire iPSC-derived organs may be possible by chimeric organogenesis.496–498 Overall, the iPSC technology will continue to propel fundamental research and therapeutic development to accelerate scientific discovery and relieve human diseases.",

        "The liver is the largest organ of the human body that is responsible for several functions related to the maintenance of homeostasis. The liver works as an endocrine and exocrine gland covering essential body functions, such as bile production, plasma protein secretion, hormone synthesis, and drug metabolization. Liver functions are maintained by parenchymal cells, cholangiocytes, and hepatocytes, in direct contact with the blood through hepatic sinusoids, which are lined by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Non-parenchymal cells are represented by LSECs and Kupffer cells (KCs), which are resident liver macrophages and stellate cells (Figure 1) [1].",
        "An imbalance of liver function results in a pathological condition known as liver failure due to its fundamental role in the body. The causes can have genetic and/or environmental origin and lead to hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, cancer, metabolic, or autoimmune disorders. While liver transplants are the second most common form of solid organ transplantation, they only meet 10% of the global needs, with liver disease being the fifth-most common cause of death worldwide. Besides the high mortality rates, the lifetime treatment patients with liver insufficiency add to the financial burden of global health care systems [2,3].",
        "Other approaches have been explored to treat liver failure, such as the xenotransplant, bio-artificial liver, and hepatocyte transplantation, due to the low availability of organs and a lifetime treatment of patients with immunosuppressive drugs [4]. Hepatocytes are commonly used because an appropriate number of cells can be isolated from livers that are not suitable for a liver transplantation. However, these treatments do not represent a definitive cure, but are commonly utilized as a temporary solution [5]. The major issue regarding hepatocytes is represented by a low survival and engraftment rate due to a lack of cellular communication between hepatocytes and the non-parenchymal cells. In fact, liver function is maintained by highly orchestrated interactions within the hepatic cellular network [6]. In consideration of these issues, further investigations are essential to ameliorate hepatocyte engraftment, including an optimal cell combination of adult hepatic cells (hepatocytes, LSECs, cholangiocytes, KCs, and stellate cells) to restore liver functionality. Hepatocytes, LSECs, and KCs are characterized by a low proliferation potential in vitro and it is difficult to maintain their phenotype. When considering these characteristics, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent an optimal alternative cell source. The iPSCs can be obtained through the ectopic expression of at least four transcription factors that are relevant for the maintenance of embryonic stem cell (ESCs) identity (f.i. Oct4, Sox-2, Klf4, and c-Myc), inducing pluripotency by reprogramming mature somatic cells [7,8,9]. The obtained iPSCs show an ESC-like phenotype with the potential of differentiating into several cell types, in addition to an unlimited self-renewal capacity. These cells are considered to be the leading candidate for a donor cell source in regenerative medicine [10]. As a result, several methods and transcription factor cocktails have been tested to generate bona fide and clinical grade iPSCs. However, despite this potential, two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures of iPSCs or primary cells are not enough to study cell-cell communications, tissue microenvironments, or replicate organ structures that mimic the in vivo environment. As a result, three-dimensional (3D) cultures were developed with the aim of replicating high cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell–cell interactions [11,12]. They are referred to as organoids, which defines 3D aggregates that contain several cell types capable of self-organization. Organoids can be generated from iPSCs, ESCs or specific adult cells, making them a promising model for basic and translational research. Several attempts have been made to generate liver organoids by different methods, which results in vascularized organoids, cholangiocytes based organoids, and, in recent years, next generation liver models developed on a chip. All of these methods share the use of iPSC derived hepatocytes that are the best characterized from the perspective of differentiation. In this review, we will describe iPSC applications as a tool for differentiating into various liver cell types, including hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, endothelial cells, and KCs. Further, we will explore the advantages in generating self-assemble or matrix-guided 3D organoids to build functional bio-artificial livers that can be useful for disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine approaches for liver diseases.",
        "The use of iPSCs and iPSC-derived differentiated cells have been beneficial for the study of disease biology, in vitro disease modeling, and the development of new drugs, as well as a tool both for screening and toxicity tests. Most importantly, iPSC technology has the potential to be used in clinical applications. Because iPSCs can be differentiated into most cell types, they can be used as a model to study molecular mechanisms underlying disease development in targeted cell types. Such models allow for a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and the comparison between affected and healthy cells.",
        "In this regard, iPSCs are a useful platform for drug discovery and development, thus reducing the high cost of generating new drugs [13]. The iPSCs, with their ability of self-renewal, can represent an unlimited source of cells for drug testing. The iPSC technology also allows for the screening of a library of human cell lines, which may represent the genetic and potentially epigenetic variations covering of a broad spectrum of the population [14], that can be useful both for preclinical drug discovery and the development of personalized medicine [15,16]. Besides their application in drug discovery, they can provide an accurate prediction of drug toxicity in humans being a vital element. For example, iPSCs can be differentiated into different cellular targets having a primary tissue-like phenotype and in an unlimited supply [17]. Variability in individual responses to potential therapeutic agents is another problem in effective drug development. The use of human iPSCs allows for the study of single nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with the ability of an individual to metabolize and clear drugs and toxins.",
        "Personalized medicine that is based on patient-specific iPSC generation, correction and differentiation is expensive and time consuming. On the other hand, cell therapy approaches are limited by immunological rejection. The main immunologic barrier to overcome between two individuals is the HLA. The HLA system is the most polymorphic locus in the human genome with almost 10,000 HLA-I and -II alleles [18]; therefore, matching donor cells and recipients for HLA is an endless task due to the countless possibilities. An alternative strategy is the generation of a bank of HLA homozygous iPSC lines and derived cells that could be transplanted in a short time and with minimal rejection in all individuals [19,20,21]. In studies that were performed in Japan, it was estimated that a database of 24,000 individuals would need to be examined to find at least one homozygous representative for each of the 50 different haplotypes [22]. Indeed, donors who are homozygous for an HLA haplotype could easily be identified from the HLA databases already in use in bone marrow donor records or cord blood banks [23]. In this way, HLA-haplotype banking of iPSCs would overcome the cost and immunological limitation of iPSC-based cell therapy, making iPSCs closer to a clinical application. In Japan, they are already at the stage of preparing iPSCs matches with the Japanese population at the major HLA loci [24]. An alternative approach to overcome immunological barriers is the generation of a “universal” donor iPSC line. Deuse et al. engineered iPSCs by overexpressing the CD47 gene and disrupting two HLA I and II genes. After differentiation into endothelial-like and cardiomyocyte-like cells, immunogenicity tests revealed no cytokines or antibody response when transplanted into allogenic humanized mice [25]. Similar approaches have been achieved for the generation of iPSC-derived HLA-universal platelets lacking HLA class I expression by knocking-out β2-Microglobulin gene [26,27]. Taken together, iPSCs can be considered an attractive tool for developing regenerative medicine applications.",
        "Since the discovery of human iPSCs, several studies have been published demonstrating the achievement of liver-like cells differentiated in vitro (Figure 2). Differentiation protocols aim to resemble, as closely as possible, the early stages of liver development. During embryogenesis and, in particular, after the process of gastrulation, the posterior foregut endoderm gives rise to hepatic progenitor cells or hepatoblasts in a process called “specification”, in which signaling factors, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and Wnt play a key role [28,29]. Liver specification is the result of the convergence of the cardiogenic mesoderm and septum transversum mesenchyme (STM), in which also early endothelial progenitors play a relevant role [30]. At this stage, under the guide of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), hepatoblasts proliferate and enter the STM to form the hepatic diverticulum known as the liver bud [31]. During the liver bud formation, the bi-potent hepatoblasts give rise to hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in a process that is finely regulated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ), Notch, Wnt, BMP, and FGF [32]. After cell commitment, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes gradually acquire a mature phenotype that, alongside other non-parenchymal cells, gives rise to the definitive adult liver structure (Figure 1).",
        "Hepatocytes are the parenchymal cells of the liver that represent 80% of the liver mass. They are specialized epithelial cells that are involved in crucial functions for the maintenance of physiological body homeostasis. Fully mature and functional hepatocytes are significant for basic research purposes and regenerative medicine, but mainly for cytotoxicity testing and drug development. The generation of hepatocytes from iPSCs cells can be obtained through defined culture conditions. Taking into consideration hepatocyte embryogenesis, most of the differentiation protocols combine growth factors and small molecules to replicate the stages of the definitive endoderm, hepatic specification, hepatoblast formation, and finally mature hepatocytes [33,34].",
        "Hepatic differentiation protocols have been developed to first induce endoderm differentiation using Activin A, FGF2, and BMP4. This first step is followed by hepatoblast differentiation, by FGF2 and BMP4, and hepatic maturation with HGF and oncostatin M (OSM) [35,36,37]. The iPSCs-derived hepatocytes obtained with these protocols exhibit similar features to hepatocytes isolated from human livers, such as lipid and glycogen storage, plasma protein secretion, and urea synthesis [38,39,40].",
        "Despite this, most iPSCs-derived hepatocytes are not fully differentiated and maintain some features of fetal or newborn hepatocytes [41,42]. In particular, the drug metabolism and detoxification ability of iPSCs-derived hepatocytes are not comparable to primary hepatocytes due to the lack of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activity. However, this feature is typical for hepatocytes cultured in vitro and it is possible that the liver microenvironment can revert the CYP450 expression and resemble hepatic function [43]. The more recent protocols have relied on the use of decellularized scaffolds or extra cellular matrix components, such as laminins and collagens, to which iPSCs can attach in order to mimic the liver microenvironment during hepatocyte differentiation [44,45,46]. Moreover, other approaches have been explored using 3D scaffolds of synthetic origins, such as hydrogel or other nanofibers scaffolds, resulting in the generation of a more mature phenotype compared to 2D cultures systems, which are able to activate the expression of CYP450 and other mature liver markers [47,48]. Despite the promising results, 3D driven hepatocyte generation is impaired by the poor standardization protocols during scaffold manufacturing. Altogether, the most recent efforts in finding the best protocol for hepatocyte differentiation highlight a strong potential for in vitro studies as a good starting point for future clinical applications [49].",
        "Cholangiocytes are the epithelial cells lining the inner space of the bile duct tree. They are the main player of hepatocyte-derived bile modification through secretion and absorption processing [50]. Although hepatocytes and cholangiocytes derive from a common progenitor, the hepatoblast, cell fate depends on defined factors released from the microenvironment during embryogenesis. Several protocols have been established to differentiate hepatoblast progenitors to functional cholangiocytes by downregulating the signaling for hepatocyte commitment in order to obtain cholangiocytes from iPSCs. The composition of differentiating culture media pushes the commitment to cholangiocytes with epidermal growth factor (EGF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), sodium taurocholate, Jagged1, and TGFβ [51,52,53,54]. Induced-cholangiocytes show mature markers, such as SOX9, OPN, CK7, CK19, CFTR, and they are negative for the hepatocyte marker HNF4a.",
        "Endothelial cells (ECs) are epithelial cells of mesoderm origin that line the inner layers of the blood and lymphatic vessels. Besides the role of being a vessel barrier, ECs are actively implicated in the immune response, inflammation, and transportation processes [55].",
        "Depending on the location, it is possible to distinguish different subtypes of ECs according to their morphology, vasculogenesis, or angiogenesis in relation to organ-specific functions. Morphologically, they can be characterized as continuous, fenestrated or sinusoidal, depending on their function [56]. For example, liver sinusoids display a discontinuous endothelium that allow the exchange of solutes and macromolecules, while the endothelium of large vessels display tight junctions that serve as a barrier [57]. Subtypes of ECs can be distinguished according to their origin whether it be arterial, venous, or lymphatic, with their size determining whether they are macrovascular or microvascular ECs. Several markers have been found to be associated with these subtypes of endothelial cells: venous subtypes express Notch4, ephrin type-B receptor 4, and Coup-transcription factor II, while arterial subtypes express EphrinB2 and Notch1, with lymphatic subtypes expressing podoplanin, prospero homeobox protein 1, and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 [57,58]. Subtypes of ECs can be identified by these unique markers; however, some common markers are shared among all ECs, such as CD31, vWF, CD144, and VEGFR2 [59]. Primary ECs can be obtained from endothelial biopsies or peripheral blood but they are difficult to retrieve and have a limited proliferation potential [60]. Moreover, given their potential therapeutic applications, it has been necessary to generate scalable quantities of ECs. For this purpose, iPSCs are an attractive source for generating ECs based on their self-renewal potential. Several methods have been developed to differentiate iPSCs into ECs and it is possible to summarize them into four approaches: co-culture, embryoid body (EB) formation, and 2D and 3D culture. Each of these methods are based on the evidence that vascular ECs are derived from a common precursor, the angioblast, which differentiates into ECs in the presence of VEGF mediated by TGFβ2 [61]. The co-culture approach involves iPSCs grown on murine bone marrow stromal cells (OP9 cells), but the efficiency of the differentiation process is low, and the use of murine feeder layers is not suitable for translation to the clinic [62,63,64]. The use of the EB formation method is based on the possibility of obtaining all three germ layers from EBs reproducing the process of embryogenesis. Several studies have, in fact, demonstrated that it is possible to obtain the cell of interest by adding specific cytokines to EB medium. For EC differentiation, BMP4 has a crucial role in differentiating iPSCs into mesoderm commitment [65,66,67,68]. To this, it can be added VEGF at different concentrations or different forms, based on the type of ECs to be obtained [69]. For example, high concentrations of VEGF can induce iPSCs to differentiate into arterial subtypes, whereas VEGF-C and angiopoietin 1 can favor lymphatic differentiation [57]. Aside from these cytokines that are commonly used in the EB method, there are others that are involved in differentiation, such as Activin A and bFGF [70]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the suppression of TGFβ pathway during specification and maintenance can increase the yield of ECs, thus promoting the ECs lifespan [71]. Although being an improvement from the co-culture method, the EB method is not the best one for achieving a high yield of ECs. For this reason, 2D and 3D methods have been developed. The 2D approach involves the use of matrixes, such as collagen, matrigel, fibronectin, or gelatin, and a two-step protocol where BMP4, activin A, bFGF, and VEGF are first used to induce mesoderm specification. Subsequently, the resulting cells are treated with Y27632 (inhibitor of associated protein kinase), SB431542 (inhibitor of TGFβ), VEGF, and bFGF to induce the final differentiation step and promote proliferation [72]. Moreover, by modulating the cytokine concentrations, it is possible to guide the differentiation process towards a specific lineage. For example, Palpant et al. demonstrated that by modulating BMP4 and activin A concentrations, it was possible to obtain hemogenic and cardiomiogenic mesodermal precursors [73]. This 2D differentiation method achieved a high yield of mature cells and decreased the time of the overall process. Finally, a 3D protocol was developed to obtain a more efficiently ECs by using different scaffolds, where iPSCs can be differentiated. For example, Zhang et al. used a fibrin scaffold and obtained ECs with a 45% efficiency. In general vessel specificity of iPSCs-derived ECs is difficult to obtain and, therefore, more specific protocols were investigated [74]. Ditadi et al. demonstrated that CD34+CD73medCD184+ cells can become arterial ECs, while, from CD34+CD73+CD184−, venous ECs can be obtained. VEGF-A and NOTCH were identified as specific factors driving arterial specification. Additionally, shear stress or hypoxia can increase the yield of arterial ECs from iPSCs-derived ECs [75].",
        "It has been demonstrated that iPSCs-derived ECs can be used to model cadmium-induced atherosclerosis, in order to study coronary artery disease in the context of diabetes both to investigate endothelium dysfunction during disease or as a tool to induce vascularization and promote survival of islet cells in regenerative medicine approaches [76]. The iPSC-ECs can promote organogenesis by enhancing the functionality of generated tissues. Recently, iPSCs derived brain microvascular ECs were able to support the specification of neuronal cells into spinal cord neural tissue with an “organ on a chip approach” [77]. A similar approach was achieved in the formation of 3D myocardial tissue by combining human iPSCs-derived cardiomyocytes, vascular mural cells, and ECs showing a well-defined structure and functional electromechanical properties [78].",
        "Despite numerous studies published regarding the differentiation of ECs, only one group has achieved the differentiation of iPSC into LSECs. Koui et al. obtained LSEC progenitors after mesoderm induction by inactivating the TGFβ pathway using the inhibitor A83-01 under hypoxic culture condition. After CD31, CD34, and FCGR2 positive enrichment, LSECs express specific markers, such as FLK1, F8, STAB2, and LYVE1, exhibiting a mature endothelial morphology [79]. Recently, the same protocol for LSEC differentiation was confirmed by Danoy et al., who further characterized the generated cells with additional specific markers, including CD144 and STAB1, and a new set of genes overlapping the gene expression profile of primary human LSECs [80]. When considering the contribution of ECs and iPSCs-derived ECs in promoting organogenesis, their role needs to be further investigated to improve these promising approaches.",
        "The Kupffer cells (KCs) are liver resident macrophages and they represent the 10% of the hepatic non-parenchymal cells, while being the largest population of resident macrophages in the body [81]. They adhere to sinusoidal endothelial cells supporting their ability to regulate hepatic function. The KCs can have a tolerogenic function preventing immune responses to immune reactive molecules present in the hepatic sinusoid [82]. However, in the case of inflammatory disease, they can shift to an activation state causing hepatocellular damage [83,84,85]. In an inflammatory state, KCs can release pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and IL-6, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species [86,87]. In co-transplantation experiments, KCs allow liver regeneration after ischemic injury producing VEGF, thus being involved in both structural regeneration and neovascularization [88]. The use of KCs in co-culture studies with hepatocytes or in the generation of liver buds do have their limitations, with the loss of their functionality after isolation and the complexity of maintaining them over long-term [89,90]. To overcome these issues, several protocols have been developed for tissue macrophage differentiation from iPSCs, despite a limited information regarding KC differentiation [91,92,93,94]. The difficulty in generating KCs from iPSCs is derived from their embryonic development. It has been demonstrated that KCs originate from primitive macrophages generated in the yolk sac from early erythroid-myeloid progenitors [95,96,97]. These progenitors under hepatic signals can differentiate into liver-specific macrophages independently of the transcription factor Myb [98,99]. Recently, Tasnim et al. generated iPSCs-derived KCs starting from macrophage precursors and adding a hepatic stimulus [100]. Embryoid bodies were formed and they were cultured in the presence BMP-4, VEGF, SCF, ROCK Inhibitor, M-CSF, and IL-3, with each added at different time points to obtain macrophage precursors [92]. Pre-macrophages were cultured in a human hepatocyte conditioned media, as hepatic stimulus, in order to obtain KC expressing specific markers, such as CLEC-4F, ID1 and ID3, and acquiring phagocytosis properties, typical of KCs, and the ability to secrete IL-6 and TNFα upon stimulation [86]. Thus, this process represents a useful in vitro model for liver bud generation and the study of liver diseases.",
        "In recent years, it has been widely demonstrated the ability to isolate and maintain in culture primary cells of animal and human origin. Two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures were fundamental for cell biologists to study molecular mechanisms and preclinical testing. However, it emerged the importance of studying cell-cell communications, tissue microenvironment, and to replicate organ structures to mimic the in vivo environment. This led to the development of three-dimensional (3D) cultures with high cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-cell interactions [11,12]. They are referred to as organoids, which define the 3D aggregates containing several cell types that are capable of self-organization [101]. Morphologically, organoids show spherical shapes and can be maintained in suspension or embedded in different matrices [102]. The main difference between 2D and 3D cultures are the different exposures to signaling molecules and nutrients. In 2D cultures, the cells are disposed as a monolayer, thus all cells have access to the stimuli. On the other hand, in 3D culture, the cells at the center of the organoid are less exposed to the factors, resembling more the physiological microenvironment and providing a model of in vivo biology. The 3D cultures offer a better approach for drug testing, and they explain the failure of drug screening in 2D culturing system [103]. As such, organoids represent an innovative tool for embryogenesis, disease modeling, toxicology, drug screening, and transplantation purposes. Organoids can be generated from iPSCs, ESCs, or specific adult cells, such as epithelial cells or epithelial and mesenchymal cells, in the presence or absence of matrixes. The first reference to organoids come from a culture obtained from the dissociation of cells derived from iPSCs or ESCs that are capable of self-organization [104]. The first studies on re-aggregation were performed using epithelial cells. Bissel et al. demonstrated that primary cells from mouse mammary glands, embedded in an extracellular matrix (hydrogel) could reorganize into glandular structures [105,106,107]. Several studies subsequently demonstrated that an ECM hydrogel could replicate cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM interactions. Using this method, it was possible to co-culture epithelial cells and fibroblasts and induce the differentiation of several types of gastric cells [108]. Even though the advantages of this new culture method could lead to the development of tissues, the limitation was represented by the short-term culture period. In 2009, Sato et al. developed a 3D system to culture Lgr5+ stem cells that were isolated from mouse intestinal tissue in ECM supplemented with R-spondin1, an LGR4/5/6 ligand that upregulates Wnt signaling, helping the maintenance of stem cell populations [109]. This organoid survived in vitro for more than three months and led to the use of isolated Lgr5+ stem cells as a cellular source for organoid cultures. Consequently, with these results, it was possible to generate human intestinal organoids. Moreover, using R-spondin1 in the culture media of Lgr5+ progenitor cells, established a starting point for the generation of organoids from other organs, such as colon, stomach, and liver [110].",
        "The first attempt of in vitro hepatic structure was reported by Michalopoulos et al., providing the initial information regarding the specific signals that are needed for assembling hepatic tissue in culture. Adult rat hepatocytes were isolated and maintained in roller bottles coated with collagen type I in a medium containing dexamethasone, HGF, and EGF, and, after 18–20 days, the cells organized themselves into a sheet with a typical hepatic configuration. It was demonstrated that HGF and EGF, are essential factors for the development of hepatic tissue and dexamethasone is necessary for hepatocyte maturation. However, the obtained hepatic sheets only survived in culture for a short period of time [111]. Subsequently, a long–term culture of self-renewing organoids was obtained from mice Lgr5+ cells that were isolated from damaged livers in the presence of R-spondin1 [112]. Indeed, only by adding R-spondin1 to the culture medium, cells exhibited self-renewing properties maintaining the ability to expand long-term as adult ductal progenitor cells, and to differentiate into hepatocytes. In recent years, several studies have focused on different methods to obtain liver organoids with the aim of mimicking the hepatic function. These methods can be summarized into four groups: co-culture methods, iPSC-derived organoids, liver on a chip, and bio printing technology.",
        "The first attempt to generate a 3D liver was established by Takebe et al. by co-culturing iPSCs-derived hepatic endoderm like cells with mesenchymal cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Figure 3A and Table 1). They were able to obtain vascularized liver bud organoids that, after transplantation in mice, gave rise to mature hepatocytes [113]. This was a demonstration that the formation of functional vessels could be the trigger to stimulate the maturation of the iPSCs-derived liver buds [114]. Asai et al. showed that paracrine factors secreted by mesenchymal cells and ECs, such as HGF [37,115,116], ANG, A2M, and PLG [117,118,119,120], could induce the formation of liver organoids, with hepatic differentiation and maturation evident once transplanted in immunodeficient mice, with a relevant albumin secretion [121]. It was also highlighted that hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) can interfere with albumin secretion and hepatic differentiation, further confirming the importance of LSECs as the starting point in liver bud organization and regeneration [122]. Other approaches attempted the generation of liver organoids entirely from iPSCs-derived cells (Table 1). Koui et al. differentiated LSECs and hepatic stem cells from iPSCs by modulating TGFβ and Rho signaling pathways, which are known to respectively regulate the proliferation and maturation of LSECs and HSC progenitors [79,123]. Obtained iPSCs, were further shown to have self-renewal properties in 2D culture systems, making this new protocol instrumental for liver modeling in vitro. An alternative approach has recently been described generating hepatobiliary organoids from iPSCs using Activin A, BMP4, BMP2, FGF4, HGF, OSM, and dexamethasone in a 45-day differentiation protocol. The authors developed a three-stage protocol in order to commit first both mesoderm and endoderm and later both hepatic and biliary co-differentiation inducing the maturation of hepatobiliary organoids that, once transplanted in immunodeficient mice, were able to survive up to eight weeks [124]. This model is useful to study liver development and can be applied in regenerative medicine approaches for liver diseases. Pettinato et al. developed an alternative protocol for liver organoid generation starting from human embryoid body formation. Specifically, human adipose microvascular endothelial cells were mixed with iPSCs and cultured in EB plates in a specific medium for hepatic differentiation containing Activin A, TGF-β, FGF4, BMP4, HGF, and Wnt pathway inhibitors. This new protocol led to an elevated hepatic differentiation and persistent albumin secretion in vivo [125].",
        "Besides co-culture protocols, only a few studies have focused on the development of liver buds starting from a homogenous cell population to directly differentiate iPSCs into organoids (Figure 3B). Guan et al. induced iPSCs to form hepatoblast aggregates that, after dissociation and culture in Matrigel gave rise to organoids containing both hepatocyte and cholangiocytes [126]. In brief, they cultured dissociated iPSCs in a medium containing BMP4, FGF2, with inhibitors of the Wnt and the PI3K pathways to induce endoderm differentiation and foregut spheroid generation. The spheroids were further cultured in a low concentration Matrigel scaffold in the presence of FGF10, HGF, OSM, and dexamethasone to induce the formation of 3D structures. Finally, Ouchi et al. initially differentiated iPSCs into foregut spheroids that, in the presence of an hepatocyte specific medium, was able to obtain definitive liver organoids containing all liver cell types and exhibiting a transcriptomic profile comparable to hepatic tissue [127].",
        "Liver organoid technology based on 3D cultures provide models for liver development, tissue biology, and pathology mimicking liver architecture and improving cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions (Table 1). However, the challenge remains to build up on the liver complexity; thus, new technologies, such as microfluidic and liver-on-chips, are rapidly developing [137] (Figure 3C). These methods can be matrix independent or dependent or can be based on 3D bioprinting. The matrix independent technology uses a hanging drop platform, perfusion chambers, or microwell arrays that facilitate 3D spheroid organization and liver specification of EBs or primary cells [138,139,140,141,142]. In matrix dependent 3D culture, several ECM components are used to mimic the native liver microenvironment. The most commonly used ECM matrix are collagen [128], Matrigel [129], and hydrogels [130] to coat microfluidic chips aiming at the formation of 3D aggregates by providing native shear stress forces.",
        "Currently, the 3D printing technology is rapidly developing to facilitate the fabrication of the 3D architecture and especially to study liver diseases and drug screening (Table 1) [131,132,133,134,135]. Generally, gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA) Hydrogels are used as ink where primary hepatic cells are included and printed in transwell or perfused microwells to induce the generation of a 3D liver-on-a-chip. Recently, bio-compatible ink has been developed by using alginate, a calcium chloride solution and pluronic polymer used to print iPSCs-derived parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells to generate 3D liver organoids showing hepatic functions in vitro [136] (Figure 3D). Even though liver-on-a chip techniques offer advantages in generating functional liver organoids, it remains a complex and expensive technique that requires further study.",
        "The self-renewing properties of organoids and the possibility to expand iPSCs and cells differentiated from iPSCs make organoids a promising model for basic and translational research. They have been used for the study of stem cell behavior, liver organogenesis, disease modelling, drug screening, toxicology, and regenerative medicine. Moreover, it is possible to generate biobanks of healthy or diseased human organoids making this technology a significant source for future studies [143].",
        "Currently, liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for liver failure, with organ availability limited and patients needing lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. With the need of alternative approaches, the xenotransplant, bio-artificial liver, and hepatocyte transplantation [4] were developed; however, these treatments do not represent a definitive cure and they are commonly used as a temporary solution while waiting for liver transplantation [5]. As such, the generation of liver organoids can represent a suitable alternative for the treatment of hepatic diseases (Table 2). The first evidence of the applicability of liver organoids goes back to 2013, when Huch et al. generated bile-duct derived organoids, from Lgr5+ stem cells, which differentiated into functional hepatocytes after transplantation into Balb/c nude mice [112,144]. Moreover, after acute liver damage, bile-duct derived organoids differentiated into hepatocytes that are able to engraft and proliferate in the liver of transplanted mice. Finally, using the same differentiation protocol, they were able to generate organoids from A1AT-deficient patients that could be used for disease modeling. Recently, hepatic organoids generated from primary hepatocytes of both mouse and human origin, once transplanted in the damaged liver of immunodeficient mice, engrafted and survived for up to 90 days exhibiting an 80% engraftment [145]. Rashidi et al. generated an organoid from iPSCs-derived hepatocytes that, after transplantation in a polycaprolactone scaffold, a successful engraftment was demonstrated with detectable serum human albumin demonstrated in two murine models of tyrosinemia [146]. Finally, a good manufacturing practice (cGMP) compliant method was established in order to generate iPSCs-derived hepatocytes that, when seeded on a 3D poly-ethylene glycol-diacrylate scaffold were able to fully differentiate into hepatic tissue structures [147]. The transplantation of alginate encapsulated organoids in the peritoneal cavity of immunocompetent mice, were able to survived and secreted human albumin in a short-term experiment, without an immune reaction. These studies can be considered as a proof of concept for the applicability of liver organoids in future clinical approaches.",
        "The use of iPSCs as a tool for drug screening to evaluate their potential, toxicity, and predict the effects of candidate drugs, has been reported extensively [148,149]. However, it is known that the patient’s genetic background can influence the effects of the drugs being tested imparting a different response. iPSCs-derived organoids in 2D culture disposed as a monolayer do not represent the physiological microenvironment, because all cells have access to the stimuli. This can explain the failure of drug screening in some cases where 2D cultures have been used [103]. For this reason, organoids are emerging as an innovative tool for drug screening and toxicology testing. In 3D cultures, cells at the center of the organoid are less exposed to the factors, thus resemble the physiological microenvironment and provide a model of in vivo biology that can also be used for personalized medicine [104]. In this context high throughput screening of small molecule libraries have been used to develop drugs for liver diseases and test possible toxic effects by using iPSCs-derived hepatocytes as a model [150,151,152]. However, it emerged the importance of generating organoids composed of several liver cell types to uncover drug side effects based on the potential role of non-parenchymal cells in hepatotoxicity. For example, KCs have an important role in drug-induced liver injury and, for this reason, hepatocytes were co-cultured with KCs to achieve a more sensitive cellular model [100]. In recent years, liver organoids were also used to test tumor sensitivity to drugs. Broutier et al. established organoids from hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, thus replicating the architecture and expression profile of the parental tumors [153]. These organoids can open opportunities for drug testing, approaches for personalized medicine and can be used for the generation of tumor bio-banks that are useful as screening platforms [154]. Finally, “liver-on-a-chip” can represent a platform for drug development and toxicology tests also allowing for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. Wand et al. generated liver organoids, using a perfusable microcapillary chip, displaying hepatocyte and cholangiocytes. The obtained organoids allowed for the measurement of a dose and time-dependent hepatotoxic effect of acetaminophen supporting the idea that “organ-on-a-chip” can represent a novel and valid platform for drug testing [155]. Even though liver organoids are an evolution of the 2D culture, drug induced liver injury still needs further investigations.",
        "Alongside the application of 3D liver organoids for regenerative medicine and drug discovery purposes, disease modeling constitutes an appealing approach to understand the molecular pathways that are involved in the pathogenesis of liver diseases (Table 3). Animal models of disease still represent the best approach for biomedical research, but the possibility to use patient-derived-iPSC organoids could improve our knowledge regarding the mechanisms that lead to the unique disease phenotype in humans. Moreover, after the discovery of an “easy-to-use” gene editing platform as CRISPR/Cas9, it is possible to introduce or revert specific mutations to replicate the physiopathology in liver organoids [156]. In 2015, two groups modeled cystic fibrosis in cholangiocytes organoids from patient-iPSCs. Mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) impair chloride ion channels that can lead, at the liver level, to the blockage of intrahepatic bile ducts. In these studies, organoids were used which presented non-functional CFTR proteins with the subsequent impairment of chloride channel and inability to cyst formation, resembling the disease phenotype. In this model, the effects of the drug VX809 were tested, demonstrating the functional rescue of the mutated CFTR protein [52,157].",
        "Liver organoids were also generated from iPSCs of patients affected by Alagille syndrome (ALGS), a multi organ disease that is caused by mutations in the JAG1 gene involved in biliary ducts formation. The JAG1 mutated iPSCs did not form tubular structures, impairing organoid generation. Interestingly, the JAG1 gene was disrupted by the CRISPR/Cas9 approach in healthy iPSCs, obtaining a similar impaired phenotype as compared to the ALGS patient-iPSCs [126]. Akbani et al. used patient-specific iPSCs to model citrullinemia type 1, an inherited metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) gene. Liver organoids generated from endodermal EpCAM+ cells resemble the phenotype of the disease defined by hyperammonemia and decreased urea production. By lentiviral vector transduction of ASS1 wild-type gene in specific-patient organoids, the disease phenotype was partially rescued, demonstrating that organoids can be genetically manipulated efficiently [158].",
        "In the context of acquired liver diseases, Nie et al. proposed studying hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection susceptibility in iPSC-derived liver organoids. Despite the fact that several models have been established for HBV infection, they do not resemble all genetic backgrounds [159]. When compared with 2D standard hepatocyte cultures, the self-organized liver organoids proved to be more susceptible to HBV infection. Moreover, the infection led to a down-regulation of specific hepatocyte markers and a high level of transaminases demonstrating a reduced hepatocyte function and altered morphology. Overall, these findings indicate that liver organoids could be used as a good HBV infection model for reproducing the virus life cycle and understand how individual genetic background can affect the pathogenesis of the disease [160].",
        "Liver cancer is the most prevalent malignancy and the incidence has increased in the last years [161]. Hepatic cancer can be distinguished into primary or secondary malignances. Primary hepatic tumors are mainly hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and mixed liver cancer. The main difficulty in finding a cure for these pathologies is due to their heterogenicity. It has been demonstrated that multi-gene mutations mainly cause liver cancer, where often within the same tumor the cancer cells do not show the same mutations [162,163]. On this basis, the development of personalized treatments is essential. Tumor liver organoids, also called tumoroids, can resemble the progression of the malignancy and can be used not only for drug screening, but also to study cancer development and define the precise treatment [164]. Tumoroids can be generated from needle biopsies, from patient-derived xenografts (PDX) or from iPSCs (Table 4). Takai et al. demonstrated that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells isolated by needle biopsy, could be cultured in porous alginate scaffolds. The generation of HCC spheroids mimic numerous features of glandular epithelium, such as the expression of EpCAM. Importantly, EpCAM positive HCC cells showed tumorigenic and metastatic potential in vivo and could be used as a tumor model [165]. The advantage in the use of needle biopsies is represented by the possibility of obtaining samples without a liver resection and they can further facilitate the generation of biobanks of liver tumoroids. The maintenance of tumor cells in vitro, however, does not replicate the microenvironment interactions, especially vascularization, interactions with the stroma, and the immune system [166]. Therefore, murine xenograft models were established to enable the implantation of human cancer cells. After tumor growth, they can be cryopreserved, expanded or used for drug testing. Most HCCs are insensitive to conventional chemotherapy due to the multi gene mutations. Broutier et al., using PDX organoids, performed a drug sensitivity experiment showing that ERK inhibition could have an effect on the progression of hepatic carcinomas [153]. Gu et al. generated a cohort of 65 liver cancers from PDX models and tested a multi-kinase inhibitor that targets FGFR1 and showed a therapeutic effect [167]. This drug was so effective that it was then used as a treatment for patients with advanced HCC [168]. Recently, a dataset of PDX has been developed from 116 HCC containing information regarding the expression profiles and the genetic alterations, which may led to the identification of biomarkers for personalized medicine [169]. PDX organoids can also be used as preclinical models mimicking the structure and the genetics of cholangiocarcinoma tumors. For example, is was demonstrated that cholangiocarcinoma can also be derived from differentiated hepatocytes [170]. Thus, by culturing cholangiocarcinoma organoids, Saito et al. were able to restore some hepatic function [171]. However, all these PDX organoids were generated from immunocompromised mice and are not suitable for immunotherapeutic approaches. To study cancer immunotherapy, it is fundamental to reproduce the human immune system and one strategy is the use of humanized mouse models for the implantation of human liver tumor fragments [172,173]. In a pivotal study, human HCC PDXs were generated in NSG gamma null mice that were repopulated with adoptive chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells [174]. The arising PDX organoids showed the transcriptional, morphological, and immunological characteristics of the primary tumor and CAR T cells directed against a HCC tumor-associated antigen were able to suppress tumor growth [175]. More recently, human HCCs were generated in NSG mice with HLA-matched human immune systems and the organoid models were responsive to immunotherapies [176]. However, the humanized mice should be generated with the same immune system of the corresponding PDX, but the repopulation of the mice with hematopoietic stem cells from cancer patients was not found to be optimal [173]. Nevertheless, this system represents an important step for the development of a personalized and humanized mouse model for liver cancer research. To model cancer, organoids derived from healthy iPSCs or normal tissues can be used, and cancer gene mutations can be induced by CRISPR/Cas9 system. In particular, a recent study has demonstrated that the combination of BAP1 loss-of-function mutation and cholangiocarcinoma mutations (TP53, PTEN, SMAD4, and NF1), induced by CRISPR/Cas9 in normal liver organoids, can affect epithelial tissue organization and cell-to-cell junctions, resulting in the acquisition of malignant features [177]. Therefore, liver cancer organoids can mimic cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM interactions and the drug sensitivity of human cancers and they can be useful for the development of personalized cures.",
        "Liver organoids, an advancement of standard 2D culture system, is an elite platform to understand early steps of liver embryogenesis and a tool to explore applications that range from disease modeling to drug screening, envisioning approaches for regenerative medicine. In contrast to 2D cell culture, organoids contain several cell types that can self-assemble into 3D aggregates replicating cell-cell interactions that allow a selective exposure to signaling molecules and nutrients that mimic the liver environment. The discovery of iPSCs boosted the organoid technology by overcoming issues that are related to short-term availability of primary cells. On the other hand, iPSC differentiation into fully mature and functional liver cells still requires refinement. Liver organoid generation has been achieved with several protocols that involve different cell types at different stage of maturation. Liver organoids vascularized by the presence of endothelial cells in the cell mix show the best results in terms of survival and functionality when transplanted in mice models. Conversely, hepatoblast aggregates display biosynthetic and drug biotransformation properties, like the human liver, but their architecture is not maintained after transplantationTo overcome these problems, other systems generating organoids directly on microwell arrays advanced to methodologies using bioprinters have been applied. The 3D spheroid organization and liver specification has been improved; however, these novel systems are still complex and expensive and, to date, have never been transplanted in vivo to prove their feasibility.",
        "Hepatic diseases are one of the major causes of death in the world and the costs for treatment will increase in the coming years [178]. Currently, the only treatment that is available is liver transplantation, but the lack of organs to be transplanted and the clinical instability of the patients make it difficult in reaching a cure for all patients. Alternative approaches have been explored, such as hepatocyte transplantation; however, this does not represent a definitive cure. To overcome these issues, several studies have focused on the development of mini liver-like structures, from both primary hepatic cells and iPSCs, which can replicate the composition of liver tissue offering a novel approach for disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. Moreover, the use of iPSCs offers innumerable possibilities based on their ability to grow indefinitely in culture, to differentiate into almost all cell types, including both mature differentiated cells and tissue-specific stem cells, offering an alternative to the limited organ supply. In the development of liver diseases treatments, it is also important to replicate the physiological processes, such as vascularization, as well as cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM interactions. Organoids exhibit exclusively, these relevant features. The 3D replication of human tissues offers the opportunity of better understanding the biological systems, thus making organoids a suitable tool for disease modeling. Several strategies have been developed to differentiate iPSCs into hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, endothelial cells, and KCs; however, difficulties have arisen in obtaining fully differentiated cells. Nevertheless, the construction and characterization of organoids have contributed to the maturation of iPSCs-derived liver cells making the picture of liver reconstruction much more feasible. Another advantage in the use of iPSCs for organoid generation is the possibility of using HLA-haplotype iPSCs to overcome the cost and the immunological limitation of iPSC-derived organoid cell therapy. Indeed, one of the major issues of liver transplantation remains the immunosuppressive therapy that HLA-haplotype iPSCs-derived organoids can potentially overcome. However, these cells cannot cover the entire variability present in the immunological population. Nevertheless, the use of universal cells can represent an alternative to HLA-haplotype iPSCs, overcoming the necessity to generate all possible haplotypes rendering them “invisible” to the immune system. However, this strategy still needs to be refined to limit the side effects related to the ability to escape immune surveillance. In recent years, the 3D technology has evolved from the generation of “liver-on-a-chip” to bio printing techniques. These systems could facilitate the maturation of iPSCs-derived liver cells and primary hepatic cells and fill the gap on the development of GMP-compliant organoids that are relevant to clinical applications. Overcoming the challenges in 3D-liver generation may lead to the replication of human physiological processes, confirming the capacity of organoids to adapt and respond over the long-term in the host microenvironment, allowing tissue engineering to become a reality for the cure of liver diseases.",

        "Historically, many key milestones have driven progress in the field of stem cell research [Fig. 1] More than half a century ago, in 1961, the first stem cells were described by Drs. James A. Till and Ernest A. McCulloch at the University of Toronto in Canada [1]. They found that stem cells derived from mouse bone marrow cells had the ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types, and were thus called pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Several decades later, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was cloned by Keith Campbell, Ian Wilmut, and colleagues at the Roslin Institute of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, demonstrating the validity of the somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) [2]. Then, in 1998, the first human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were isolated by James Thomson in the USA [3]. In 2006, induced PSCs (iPSCs) were derived from reprogrammed adult somatic cells with just four basic transcription factors, reduced from 24 factors [4,5]. In 2012, Shinya Yamanaka (Kyoto University, Japan and Gladstone Institutes, USA) and John Gurdon (Gurdon Institute, Cambridge, UK) were co-recipients of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that mature cells could be reprogrammed into a pluripotent state [6]. Researchers have since detected innate adult stem cells within several organs [7–9]. To date, five basic categories of stem cells have been put forward following our systematic review of stem cell research: embryonic stem cells (ESCs), very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs), nuclear transfer stem cells (NTSCs), reprogrammed stem cells (RSCs), and adult stem cells (ASCs) (see Table 1). Only NTSCs have been used to generate a complete organism: monkeys were grown from NTSCs in China in 2018 [10]. On the other hand, ESCs, iPSCs, and adult stem cells have only been used to generate tissues and organs. In recent years, and especially in the last decade, stem cell research has blossomed into an exciting and promising field. Stem cells, especially ESCs and iPSCs have shown great application promise in four major fields: regenerative and transplant medicine [11,12]; disease modeling [13,14]; drug discovery screening [15,16]; and human developmental biology [17] [18],. Thus, the evolution of regenerative medicine continues, from the early first descriptions of stem cells to their expanding clinical applications at present.Fig. 1.The timeline of major scientific advances during the history of stem cell research. Multipotent stem cells were first discovered in 1961, representing the initial breakthrough in stem cell and regenerative medicine. Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1997. The transition from fundamental research, to pre-clinical research, and finally to clinical trials is driven by many discoveries and milestones. Many advances in reprogramming factor combinations, experimental methods, and the elucidation of signaling pathways have recently contributed to the first clinical trials for retinal cell transplants and spinal cord transplants.

        "As iPSC reprogramming technology is still relatively new, challenges remain – especially with respect to cell proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, in this review, we systematically review the following methodological topics: induction of pluripotency by genomic modifications; the construction of novel vectors in combination with reprogramming factors; promotion of iPSC pluripotency with small molecules and genetic signaling pathways; induction and enhancement of reprogramming with microRNAs; induction and enhancement of iPSC pluripotency with chemicals; generation of specific differentiated cell types; and maintenance of iPSC pluripotency and genomic stability. Ultimately, these topics are crucial for maximizing the efficacy of iPSC generation and differentiation in preparation for clinical translation. We also consider advances in cell culture, namely feeder-free culture, xeno-free media, and various biomaterial-augmented techniques. Further, we include discussions of three-dimensional (3D) cellular and bioprinting technologies, PSC resources, and second-generation direct cellular reprogramming in vivo. Finally, long-term stem cell research and clinical goals are considered.",
        "The overall purpose of this article is to provide a synopsis of significant historical and recent research advancements in stem cell and regenerative medicine. Although a detailed presentation of all relevant stem cell data and subtopics would be beyond the scope of this article, we do provide guidance to help readers identify resources for deeper study.",
        "PSCs are characterized by the properties of self-renewal and potency, wherein the former refers to the cell’s ability to proliferate and the latter refers to the cell’s ability to differentiate into specialized cell types derived from one of three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, or mesoderm [19]. Aoi (2016) summarized three in vivo assays to assess the potency of pluripotent stem cells in mouse models [20]. The first model is the teratoma formation assay, which is used to evaluate the spontaneous generation of differentiated tissues from the three germ layers after the transplantation of cells into immunocompromised mice. The second model is the chimera formation assay, which tests whether stem cells contribute to development by injecting these cells into diploid early embryos (2N blastocysts). Chimeras are then bred, and other assay endpoints include when the donor cells have germline transmission capacity, generate functional gametes, and retain chromosomal integrity with functional pluripotency. The third model is the tetraploid (4N) complementation assay, which is used to determine the capacity of the tested pluripotent cells within an entire organism. After injecting cells into 4N embryos (4N blastocysts), the stages of growth are monitored for extra-embryonic lineages as a result of the transplanted stem cells and not the embryo itself.",
        "The five basic stem cell types are ESCs, VSELs, iPSCs, NTSCs, and adult stem cells. Each cell type may be harvested or generated from various sources (see Table 1). The features of each cell types are described as follows:Embryonic Stem Cells. Human ESCs (hESCs) are harvested from early-stage blastocysts (4~5 days postfertilization) by destroying the source blastocyst or by harvesting later stage (3 month gestational age or less) tissues. hESCs are the first stem cells to have been applied in research applications, especially, they are still commonly used in the clinical trials at present (https://clinicaltrials.gov/).Recently, one novel type of pluripotent stem cell - Very Small Embryonic-Like Stem Cells (VSELs) – has shown promise [21]. VSELs were identified in 2006 by Ratajczak et al. [22], and over 20 independent laboratories have since confirmed their existance [21,23–25]. This being said, other groups have questioned their existence [26]. These cells are small and early development stem cells in adult tissues, which express pluripotency markers, and according to their primitive morphology and gene expression profile, are termed VSELs [27]. Regarding its morphology, VSELs are small cells, corresponding to the cells in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, which are about 3 to 5 μm in mice and around 5 to 7 μm in humans (slightly smaller than red blood cells). For gene expression profile, VSELs express some ESCs markers, such as SSEA, nuclear Oct-4A, Nanog, and Rex1 [21]. VSELs also express several markers for migrating primordial germ cells (PGCs), such as Stella and Fragilis [21]. Additionally, VSEL single-cell cDNA libraries shown murine bone marrow-isolated biomarkers such as very small Sca-1+lin-CD45-cells [28]. Thus, the developmental origin of VSELs may be associated with germline deposits in developing organs during embryogenesis [27]. Ratajczak [21] (2019) proposed a VSEL developmental and functional model. According to this model, VSELs originated from primordial germ cells (PGCs) and further differentiated into three potential fates - mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hemangioblasts [two subtypes of hematopoietic stem cells including (HSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)], and tissue-committed stem cells (TCSCs). Thus, VSELs, as a pluripotent stem cell, may hold a potential advantage of being able to differentiate across germ layers in adult animals or human subjects. Such cells may function as an alternative to monopotent tissue-committed stem cells in adults [27]. In addition, VSELs may overcome several problems of ESCs (ethical controversies) and iPSCs (teratoma formation) for future stem cell studies and clinical applications.Nuclear Transfer Stem Cells. Originally discovered in 1996, the somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technique has gradually evolved and can now generate NTSCs. SCNT begins by first implanting a donor nucleus (i.e. nucleus donor) from another fully differentiated somatic cell (e.g. fibroblast) into an enucleated oocyte (i.e. cytoplasmic donor or egg donor with nucleus removed). Then, the new host egg cell triggers the genetic reprogramming of the donor nucleus. Subsequently, numerous mitotic divisions of this single cell in culture develop a blastocyst, which is about 100 cells at early-stage embryo. The end result generates an organism with almost identical DNA to the original organism – a clone of the nuclear donor. Such a nucleus donor cloning is a dominated genotypes and phenotypes, while the cytoplasmic donor or egg donor has some genotypes and phenotypes in this new entire living organism as well. This process can produce both therapeutic and reproductive cloning. In July 1996, Dolly the Sheep was the first successful reproductive clone of a mammal, which was performed in Scotland, United Kingdom [29] [30] [31],., Thus far, some two dozen other species have been cloned [32]. Recently, in January of 2018, Chinese scientists in Shanghai announced the successful use of fetal fibroblasts to clone two female macaque monkeys by SCNT [10], thus creating the first primates to be cloned by SCNT.",

        "Creating cloned primates could revolutionize human disease research [32]. Genetically uniform non-human primates may be useful animal models for primate biology and biomedical research. Such animal models could be used to investigate disease mechanisms and drug targets, obviating the confounding factor of genetic variation, thereby reducing the number of laboratory animals needed [32]. The technology could also be combined with CRISPR-Cas9 genomic-editing to create genetically engineered primate models of human disorders, such as Parkinson disease (PD) and various cancers. Pharmaceutical companies have signaled a high demand for cloned monkeys to use in drug testing [32]. Enthused by the potential of this prospect, the city of Shanghai has prioritized funding for the establishment of an International Primate Research Center that can produce cloned research animals for use internationally [32]. Relative to other stem cell approaches, SCNT is unique in that it can generate an entire living body rather than sheets of cells, tissues, and pieces of organs, which can be created with ESC and iPSC protocols. From the perspective of biophysiological function, SCNT thus has advantages over ESCs and iPSCs for basic research and clinical application.(4).Reprogrammed Stem Cells. Since 2006 when Yamanaka and colleagues first generated iPSCs, reprogramming technologies in general have significantly progressed. This is especially true with respect to direct reprogramming methods in vitro and in vivo to produce specific tissue-lineages by using lineage-restricted transcription factors, RNA signal modifications, and small molecules or chemicals. These direct approaches skips the iPSCs step yielding more precise cells, such as induced neural progenitor cells (iNPCs), which are closer to the target cell lineage, such as neural cells and subsequent motor neurons. Thus, reprogrammed stem cells (RSCs) are derived from by applying any manual laboratory methods to reprogram genetic signals of the primary cells, but they do not include the SCNT technique.",

        "To overcome the ethical and immunogenic challenges associated with hESCs, iPSCs have emerged as a promising alternative. This is because iPSCs are derived from adult somatic tissues, and hiPSC sources, such as blood, skin, and urine, are plentiful. In addition, because hiPSCs can be harvested from individual patients, immune rejection can be avoided when they are transplanted autologously (self-donor). Thus, hiPSCs have extraordinary potential for personalized medicine. A variety of iPSC sources exist. In theory, almost any mature cell type in the human body, including umbilical cord blood cells, bone marrow cells, peripheral blood cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and even cells in urine can be reprogrammed into iPSCs and then be differentiated into tissue-specific cells of desired lineages [33] [34] [35],., To be clear, mature (a.k.a. “adult”) stem cells refer to the differentiated state of the cells themselves, not the maturity (or adult status) of the body from which they were harvested. Umbilical cord blood or bone marrow stem cells are considered “ready-to-use” in that they can be employed directly for transplantation without reprogramming. Adult stem cells will be discussed in more details in the following section. Non-autologous (i.e., non-self) stem cells carry an inherent risk of immune rejection. Easily accessible tissues for autologous stem cell harvesting include skin, hair, and urine. To avoid any further discomfort or risk in patients - especially medically fragile patients who have suffered traumatic medical events such as a heart attack or spinal cord injury (SCI) – urine is a noninvasive stem cell source. Although cells harvested from urine have not yet received substantial research and attention, it is our view that they are a highly promising stem cell source which warrant further research.",
        "Noninvasive, reproducible, simple, and easily accessible mature somatic cell sources and harvesting protocols are needed for development of directed iPSC differentiation for broader clinical use. In addition to these features, urine samples provide an unlimited autologous cell source, and cells obtained from urine samples have robust reprogramming characteristics. Urine is a relatively untapped source of autologous MSCs [36]. A method for obtaining hiPSCs from renal tubular cells present in urine was described by Zhou and colleagues in July 2011, with a more detailed protocol for obtaining exfoliated renal epithelial cells being published by the same group one year later [37]. The latter method, which requires only a 30-ml sample of urine, is simple, relatively fast, cost-effective, and universal (applicable to patients of all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic backgrounds). The total procedure involves just 2 weeks of cell culturing and 3-4 weeks of reprogramming. It produces high iPSC yields with excellent differentiation potential. Urine-derived iPSCs collected from 200 mL clean midstream urine samples via the Sendai virus delivery system showed a normal karyotype and exhibited the potential to differentiate into three germ layers in a teratoma assay [38]. In addition, Zhang and colleagues reported that a subpopulation of cells isolated from urine had progenitor cell features, including cell-surface expression of c-Kit, SSEA4, CD105, CD73, CD91, CD133, and CD44, markers that can be used to distinguish among bladder cell lineages (e.g. urothelial, smooth muscle, endothelial and interstitial) [39]. Thus, these cells could serve as an alternative cell source for urinary tract tissue engineering and reconstruction. Similarly, upper urinary tract cells have been reported to possess expansion and differentiation capabilities for forming urothelial and myogenic cells, which could potentially be used for bladder tissue engineering in patients needing cystoplasty [40]. Unfortunately, neither of these studies used an iPSC stage before differentiation; they collected urothelial and myogenic cells only. Importantly, however, an hiPSC development approach for urine-derived cells was described for stored iPSCs under feeder-free, virus-free, serum-free conditions without use of the oncogene c-Myc [41]. This bank produced 93 hiPSC lines from 20 genetically diverse donors.",
        "Urine samples have been shown to be a good alternative option for harvesting iPSCs to be differentiated into different cell subtypes across various systems. In the cardiovascular system, urine cell-derived functional cardiomyocytes were shown to generate action potentials, both in vitro and in vivo, following differentiation of reprogrammed iPSCs by lentiviral-vector gene transduction [42]. With respect to metabolic diseases, iPSCs were generated from urine cells from one patient with a mitochondrial DNA mutation [43]. In the endocrine system, human urine-derived stem cells facilitated diabetic wound repair by promoting angiogenesis [44]. Additionally, in a neuroendocrine application, cells obtained from the urine of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome (MEN1) were used to generate iPSCs with non-integrated episomal plasmids carrying Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and miR-302-367 without using c-Myc [45] [46],. In the field of psychiatry, an iPSC line derived from a urine sample of a patient with obsessive-compulsive disorder was produced with an integration-free CytoTune®-iPS 2.0 Sendai reprogramming kit [47].",
        "Applications of iPSC technology to the nervous system also exist. Integration-free neural progenitor cells generated by reprogramming of epithelial-like cells from human urine can be differentiated into multiple functional neuronal and glial subtypes in vitro [48]. Recent data obtained in experimental animal models showed that reprogrammed integration-free iPSCs derived from human neural progenitors collected from urine differentiated into neurons and glia within 8 weeks of being transplanted into contused mouse thoracic spinal cords, though the study lacked functional data with respect to SCI recovery and included the oncogene c-Myc in its reprogramming protocol [49].",
        "Recent experiments indicated that urine-derived iPSCs are a promising resource for motor neuron disease modeling and cell therapy development [50,51]. In addition, urine cells from a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (autosomal dominant inherited neurodegenerative disease) were transformed into iPSCs with a SeV delivery system, providing a robust platform for further study of this disease’s pathogenesis and its susceptibility to pharmacotherapy as well as gene therapy [52]. Recently, iPSCs generated from urine-derived cells from a patient with spinal muscular atrophy with an Epi reprogramming vector (c-Myc-free and non-integrating) combined with CRISPR technology were used to correct the disease-causing mutation at the iPSC level, and these cells were then were developed into motor neurons [53]. Such a protocol may eventually lead to gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.",
        "The aforementioned studies have demonstrated that urine samples represent an extremely valuable resource for cells with high reprogramming efficiency. Additional evidence is needed with respect to the efficiency of such cells for producing various subtypes of nervous system cells (e.g., subtypes of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, sensory neurons, and motor neurons). Such cells derived from urine cells would be expected to have a genetic or epigenetic memory of their primary genotype-phenotype, which may prevent the efficacy of transformation. Thus, challenges remain. Physiological functional studies will be critical for bringing urine sample-derived stem cells into clinical practice.(5).Adult Stem Cells. When first discovered, adult stem cells generated significant excitement surround their translational applications, however, questions remain about their clinical utility. Adult stem cells harvested from specific organs, such as the brain, spinal cord, or heart, may offer a novel direction for cell therapy. Characterization of stem cells in adult organs has suggested that their survival, quiescence, and activation depend on precise signals in their microenvironment [54]. They often appear to have the capacity to recognize damaged sites and dying cell types, regenerating only missing cells. Tissue-resident adult stem/progenitor cells are potentially easily accessible sources for cell therapy. These cells have a high self-renewal ability and multilineage differentiation potential to reconstitute damaged tissues without immune rejection. In the other hand, adult stem cells harvested from mature tissues may be reprogrammed into iPSCs, as discussed above. Exogenous biological small molecules may also be used to stimulate endogenous cells in situ to grow and differentiate into specific cell types.",

        "The most important subcategory of adult stem cells is MSCs. In particular, these are the most widely used adult stem cells at present. Although MSCs were isolated initially from bone marrow, other adult tissues sources have also been identified [7]. The major sources of human MSCs are umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, adipose-derived, placental and amniotic fluid, and menstrual blood. Umbilical cord blood, which can only be collected at birth, has several practical considerations, such as banking safety, contamination, and identity and quality issues after long-term storage. There are several standardized operating procedures for obtaining clinically useful cord blood for future use to benefit infant donors [55], such as adhering to informed consent policies, financial disclosures, conflict-of-interest policies, and others [56] [57,58],. Stem cells from bone marrow has been widely studied in vitro and in animal models, but clinical trials have shown only limited effectiveness.",
        "The exciting discovery of adult stem/progenitor cells in the brain and heart [59] has inspired hope that such endogenous stem cells may someday be used to repair tissues damaged in myocardial infarction and stroke. To use these MSCs, they must be identifiable with biomarkers. For example, the International Society for Cellular Therapy recommends identifying hMSCs with immunopositivity for CD105, CD73, and CD90 surface antigens (expressed by ≥95% of such cells), combined with immunonegativity for CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79a or CD19, and human leukocyte antigen–DR isotype (≤2% positivity among hMSCs) [7].",
        "As mentioned above, signal transduction pathway stimulation can improve transformation efficacy for both exogenously and endogenously sourced stem cells. Both ESC and iPSC culture systems can be applied for in vitro generation of desired cells for transplantation into patients. Alternatively, small biomolecules (e.g. growth factors) may be injected into damaged living tissues to promote differentiation of endogenous adult stem cells into desired cell types, such as motor neurons, sensory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes in neural tissue damaged by SCI or stroke. Although this latter method may seem simple in principle, such approaches have not yet been validated outside of animal models for clinical applications. Indeed, further evidence is needed to clarify the relative feasibility and efficacy of these two approaches. It is possible that both approaches may be combined to further optimize outcomes [60].",
        "Here we explore further the promise of second-generation cellular reprogramming by way of direct in vivo approaches, which may overcome critical challenges associates with in vitro systems such as shifting cell arrangements and functions, contamination, and time-intensive processing [61]. The fundamental principles are similar to those in first generation in vitro approaches, except that all protocols are carried out entirely within living animals in native target tissues (e.g. mouse brain, heart). This approach relies on the native microenvironment to produce natural products and obtain in situ recovery of locally degenerated and damaged tissues.",
        "In direct in vivo cellular reprogramming, lineage-restricted transcription factors and microRNAs are used to reprogram resident support cells to generate desired cell types. The reprogramming differs from those used in vitro because it is more universal and encompasses early-stage reprogramming factors, such as OSKM, which are able in theory to differentiate stem cells into any type of cell in the body. Lineage-restricted transcription factors and microRNAs have the potential to reprogram local somatic cells to differentiate into specific types of cells without an intermediary stem/progenitor cell stage. The mechanisms mediating such reprogramming is unclear, but are likely driven by forces involving cellular memory and the native microenvironment.",
        "In vivo somatic cell reprogramming research has made substantial progress recently, especially for cardiomyocyte and neuronal fates. In 2008, Zhou et al. reported on the in vivo reprogramming of pancreatic exocrine cells into beta cells with the transcription factors NGN3, PDX1, and MAFA [62]. The Zhou study paradigm provides a potential blueprint for directing cell reprogramming without reversion to a PSC state. In addition, use of the transcription factors FOXa3, GATA4, HNF1a, and HNF4a generated hepatocyte-like cells directly from myofibroblasts in fibrotic mouse livers and reduced liver fibrosis in vivo [63], suggesting this approach may lead to treatment for chronic liver disease.",
        "In the cardiovascular system, mouse cardiac fibroblasts have been reprogrammed using cardiac developmental transcription factor genes - namely, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 with [64] or without [65] HAND-2. These were transplanted and subsequently induced the development of cardiomyocyte-like cells. These were electrically incorporated into myocardial tissue and used to improve cardiac function in a cardiac injury model. It is hoped that this line of research may lead to clinical protocols to utilize the endogenous bulky pool of fibroblasts within the heart for targeted cell therapy.",
        "In the nervous system, endogenous mouse astrocytes can be converted directly into neurons (neural nuclei protein immunopositive) in situ with transplanted human cells or endogenous mouse cells as starting cells. The neural conversion genes include Ascl1, Brn2a, and Myt1l [66]. In fact, a single transcription factor gene, Ascl1, is sufficient to convert brain astrocytes into functional neurons in vivo [67]. Ascl1 has been used in vivo to reprogram retinal Müller glia toward a neuronal fate [68]. In the adult mouse brain, Sox2 was sufficient to reprogram resident astrocytes into proliferative induced adult neuroblasts, which went on to develop into electrophysiologically mature neurons that functionally integrated into local neural networks in the presence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, noggin, or when the mice were treated with a histone deacetylase inhibitor [60]. Interestingly, Sox2 has also been used to reprogram pericytes in the brain into induced neurons [69]. These results demonstrate that adult astrocytes have the potential for extraordinary plasticity in vivo. Notably, the latter experiment demonstrated the methodological feasibility of both reprogramming and injection to induce endogenous cells to differentiate into a specific type of cell in vivo.",
        "Stem cells can be transformed into specific types of cells via reprogramming and subsequent differentiation. There are three critical aspects of ongoing research into stem cell development and differentiation: differences between iPSCs and ESCs, genetic “memory” of cells/tissues, and direct working systems in vitro or in vivo.",
        "Direct comparisons of neural-differentiation capacity between human iPSCs and ESCs have suggested that human iPSCs generate neuroepithelia and functionally appropriate neuronal types, similar to the outcomes obtained with hESCs under the same conditions [70]. Relative to ESCs, however, iPSCs, were found to be less efficient and to exhibit greater variability, deficiencies that could be improved with culturing technique alterations [70]. Some have found that particular iPSC lines may be epigenetically unique and inclined to generate cells of a certain lineage [70]. Once a cell type has fully matured, such as an adult fibroblast, iPSCs derived from this cell type may carry a genetic \"memory\" of the primary cell type, and it can be difficult to “reprogram away” completely [71]. Epigenetic memory may also be responsible for the lineage-specific bias of some hiPSCs [72]. It remains to be clarified how this genetic memory diverges among different cell types and tissues.",
        "Specific types of desired cells may also be obtained directly in vitro or in vivo without a stem cell reprogramming process. For example, after screening a pool of nineteen candidate genes, the combination of three factors genes, Ascl1, Brn2, and Myt1l, was shown to be sufficient to induce rapid transformation of in vitro mouse ESCs and postnatal fibroblasts into functional neurons, which not only express multiple neuron-specific proteins but also produce action potentials and form functional synapses [73]. Direct in vivo approaches for producing iPSCs are discussed in more detail above.",
        "In 2006, Yamanaka and colleagues made the groundbreaking discovery that only four of the twenty-four previously used pluripotency transcription factors are necessary to reprogram mature mouse fibroblasts into an embryonic stem cell-like state, creating iPSCs (Fig. 1 and 2). These four so-called Yamanaka factors are Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (abbreviated in a group as OSKM). Several years later, Yamanaka’s OSKM formula was used to generate iPSCs from human fibroblasts as well [5,74] [75],. These factors show a remarkable ability to induce pluripotency, enabling cells to develop into any of 220 cell types, at least in theory, by way of reversible epigenetic changes. Recently, Kilens and colleagues introduced a protocol that enables parallel derivation of isogenic primed and naïve human iPSCs [76]. They showed that naïve human iPSCs can be generated directly from somatic cells with OKMS overexpression and defined culture media, in a protocol with a shorter tissue culture time and more extended passages compared to previously published strategies that require priming of PSCs prior to their conversion into naive PSCs [77] [78,79],.Fig. 2.The four key methods for delivering reprogramming factors. Integrating viral systems were the first to be used to deliver transcription factors to generate stem cells, but they have the disadvantage of incorporating their genetic material and contributing to teratoma formation. By avoiding integration, novel methods (non-integrating vectors, self-excising vectors, and non-integrating non-viral vectors) represent iterative improvements upon this initial methodology. Such approaches provide significant advances in the safety and efficacy of iPSCs, which may then be applied for downstream scientific and clinical applications.",

        "Oct4 has been recognized as the most important PSC reprogramming factor, with Nanog and Lin28 being effective substitutes for Klf4 and c-Myc. Notably, the so-called Oct4 complex consists of Oct4 protein in physical association with the reprogramming factor protein products Sox2, Nanog, and Esrrb [62] [80],. A year after the publication of Yamanaka’s OSKM factor publication, Yu and colleagues described a modified four-factor induction protocol employing Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Lin28, which exhibit reprogramming with an efficiency similar to that obtained with the Yamanaka factors [81]. Additionally, due to concerns regarding the possible tumorigenic risk associated with using the proto-oncogenes Klf4 and c-Myc as well as an interest in minimizing the number of factors applied, Feng and colleagues developed a three-factor method, which includes the orphan nuclear receptor gene Esrrb together with Oct4 and Sox2; Feng’s three-factor method was shown to differentiate mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into iPSCs with better proficiency than was obtained with the Yamanaka factors [82]. The factor c-Myc was shown to be dispensable for direct reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts the year prior to the introduction of Feng’s three-factor method [83]. Subsequently, the number of factors required for reprogramming has been reduced to two, including various combinations of Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc [84,85], and then reduced to Oct3/4 alone [86–88].",
        "The use of different transcription factors for reprogramming seems to have differing efficiency for producing specific subtypes of cells in various stages. For example, the OSKM protocol can dedifferentiate early-stage non-terminally differentiated murine B cells into a pluripotent state. Reprogramming of mature late-stage B cells, however, requires supplementary transcriptional factors, such as ectopically expressed CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-alpha (a myeloid transcription factor) or specific knockdown of the B cell transcription factor PAX5 [89].",
        "In early studies, various viral vectors, including retroviruses and lentiviruses, were used for the delivery and transduction of reprogramming factors [4] with a progressive increase in the efficiency of reprogramming [90]. Unfortunately, viral integration of transcription factor genes has the potential to produce consequential genomic alterations, including oncogenic changes in Klf4 and c-Myc, which makes such protocols not amenable to clinical application [90].",
        "The successful clinical applications of iPSCs will require overcoming serious downsides, such as incomplete reprogramming and genomic integration induced genomic alterations [91]. In recent years, iPSC techniques for removing viral vectors with non-integrating reprogramming and maximizing reprogramming efficiency have shown promise. This progress includes the recognition that various molecules, such as constructed non-viral vectors, genetic factors, signaling molecules, small bioactive molecules, microRNAs, and chemicals (described in the following section), can modulate reprogramming efficiency [82].",
        "A critical step for advancing iPSC technology is the establishment of non-viral delivery systems for introducing reprogramming factors into somatic cells. Combined with a piggyBac transposon – a single and non-viral vector plasmid comprised of a removable (eliminated from the genome by Cre) reprogramming cassette of c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4, and Sox2 with the self-biomarker mOrange – has been used to reprogram somatic fibroblasts into iPSCs [92]. Other features of the piggyBac system have been developed that are tremendously valuable for genome-wide screening of new reprogramming factors, including piggyBac transposase-mediated excision [93], high transposition activity, precise excision, and good genomic coverage [94]. In addition, two expression plasmids - one with Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4 complementary DNAs and the other with c-Myc complementary DNA - were introduced into MEFs giving rise to iPSCs without evidence of plasmid genomic integration [95].",
        "In 2015, Schlaeger and colleagues [96] reported a systematic comparison of the three most prominent non-integrating reprogramming methods available for generating hiPSCs: Sendai-viral (SeV) reprogramming, Episomal (Epi) reprogramming, and mRNA transfection. In the SeV reprogramming system [97], SeV particles are employed to transduce target cells with replication-competent RNA molecules encoding the original OSKM set of reprogramming factors (e.g. the Cytotune kit from Life Technologies, now incorporated with Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). In the Epi reprogramming system [98], extended reprogramming factor expression is accomplished by Epstein-Barr virus-derived sequences enabling episomal plasmid DNA replication in dividing cells. Human Epi reprogramming was first developed in the Thomson laboratory [99], and an additional competent Epi technique was applied by Schlaeger with Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Lmyc, and Lin28A combined with knock-down of P53 [98]. In the mRNA reprogramming system [100], cells are transfected with in vitro-transcribed mRNAs encoding the OSKM genes plus Lin28A and green fluorescent protein-encoding mRNAs. Because mRNAs have a very short half-life with transfections lasting some 1-3 hours, hiPSC reprogramming requires long daily transfection procedures [96]. Although all three methods produced high-quality hiPSCs, substantial variance is observed with respect to aneuploidy rate, reprogramming efficiency, reliability, and workload. Reprogramming efficiency and safety for clinical translation remain challenges for these techniques.",
        "Relative to the other systems, SeV reprogramming is highly effective, with a lower workload and no nonappearance of viral sequences in most lines at higher passages. Meanwhile, compared to SeV reprogramming, Epi reprogramming has the advantages of a higher consistency in hiPSC generation from fibroblasts or blood samples [101] and more rapid reprogramming agent elimination. Several groups have employed small molecules [102] or used additional or modified reprogramming factors, such as BCL-XL [103] or OCT4-VP16 [104], to further boost Epi reprogramming efficiency. Schlaeger’s group in particular demonstrated significantly more effective hiPSC colony production with lentiviral (100% success rate), Epi (93%), and SeV (94%) methods compared to mRNA systems (27%, all p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test).",
        "Regarding safety for clinical translation, Schlaeger’s team suggested that Epi reprogramming was particularly well-suited for clinical translation due to it being integration-free, reliable with patient fibroblasts and blood cells, and having a very simple reagent requirement, namely plasmid DNA, which can be produced readily with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) [96]. It has been a challenge to obtain sufficient cGMP levels under general laboratory conditions employing the same plasmids reported in the review (plasmids #27077, #27078, and #27080 from Addgene, Watertown, MA). Though the Schlaeger team has reported some data demonstrating a low-risk level [96], Epi reprogramming remains challenging. This is because of the altered genetic integrity of the resulting hiPSC lines due to the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) cassette of tumor protein p53 (TP53) after cell/tissue bioengineering. In their report, PCR data revealed that O4-shP53 plasmid sequences were reserved in 13/14 higher-passage DNAhigh lines. The TP53 gene is the most commonly mutated gene (>50%) in human cancer, and the TP53 gene plays a vital role in averting cancer development [105]. Therefore, TP53 is categorized as a tumor suppressor gene, but its shRNA in hiPSCs functions as a silencer of TP53 expression during Epi reprogramming. Additionally, p53 plays a significant role in the maintenance of stem cells during development and as a differentiation regulator [106,107]. Indeed, TP53 and its shRNA has been shown to be extremely effective for enhancing cell reprogramming (~100 fold). This being said, it is not well suited for iPSC applications since TP53, and its shRNA in particular, may insert into iPSCs genomes, which may escape apoptosis and cause teratoma formation [108] [109],.",
        "Notably, the major Epi reprogramming reagents provided by Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Stemgent have been upgraded: CTS™ CytoTune™-iPS 2.1 Sendai Reprogramming Kit (ID: A34546) and StemRNA™-NM Reprogramming Kit (ID: 00-0076). Both kits are manufactured according to cGMP principles to enable a seamless transition to the clinic, though the latter’s efficiency requires further improvement. Research groups interested in reprogramming kits must weigh various factors when selecting an appropriate kit. For basic research, and to greatly improve Epi reprogramming efficiency, Addgene plasmids (#27077, #27078, and #27080) may be used together with additional small molecules (reviewed in the following chapter, e.g. cocktail with MEK inhibitor PD0325901, GSK3β inhibitor CHIR99021, TGF-β/Activin/Nodal receptor inhibitor A-83-01, ROCK inhibitor HA-100, and human leukemia inhibitory factor [102]); or other reprogramming factors (such as synthetic factors by fusing the VP16 transactivation domain to Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2, respectively [104]). For translational research, it is prudent to purchase the relatively inexpensive CytoTune iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., ID: A16517) because it allows an easy transition to the upgraded 2.1 version for clinical applications. For clinical application, the CTS™ CytoTune™-iPS 2.1 Sendai Reprogramming Kit (ID: A34546) may be used. Although it has a lower efficiency than the Sendai kits, the StemRNA™-NM Reprogramming Kit (Stemgent, ID: 00-0076) is an appropriate option for basic research involving stem cells and specific mRNAs of interest. Notably, ReproRNA™-OKSGM Kit (Catalog #05930) is a newly launched kit by STEMCELL Technologies. It is described as a non-integrating, self-replicating RNA reprogramming vector for generating iPS cells. This single-stranded RNA replicon vector contains five reprogramming factors: Oct4, Klf-4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Glis1. Although official research reports in NCBI have not yet been published, the company claims several advantages with this kit: a non-viral, non-integrating vector system; a self-replicating vector requiring only a single transfection; the vector contains all reprogramming factors; and comparable fibroblast reprogramming efficiency to Sendai virus.",
        "The combination of transcription factor-induced reprogramming with small-molecule modulation of cell signaling is a promising strategy for promoting iPSC pluripotency. Chemicals and small molecules that target signaling pathways related to cell fate, state, and function can be substituted for traditional reprogramming factors OSKM or can be used to enhance somatic cell reprogramming efficiency [110]. Hou et al. in 2013 [111] revealed the first successful reprogramming of mouse cells into iPSCs by a novel cocktail with seven small molecules (VPA, CHIR99021, E616452, Tranylcypromine, Forskolin, 3-deazaneplanocin A, and TTNPB. Furthermore, Zhao et al. in 2015 [112] promoted a 1000-fold greater efficiency by adding four small molecules (AM580, EPZ004777, SGC0946, and 5-aza-2-deoxycitidine). These mechanistic alternations of cell fate may be associated with metabolic switching from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis for the critical step of iPSCs reprogramming as well as small molecules substituting for Oct4 in human cell reprogramming [113]. Important details and chemical methods for generating iPSCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and pancreatic β cells can be found in Ma’s article (2017) [113] for readers to study in greater detail.",
        "Reprogramming can also be enhanced by induction of DNA demethylation [91]. The peptidylprolyl isomerase PIN1 regulates the induction and maintenance of pluripotency via its modulation of phosphorylation signaling [114]. The competent piggyBac transposon-based approach can produce integration-free iPSCs while satisfying the pluripotency criteria, namely pluripotency gene expression, teratoma formation in immunodeficient host mice, and contribution to chimeras [115]. Thus, teratoma formation confirms iPSC pluripotency and developmental potential, suggesting that the cells are able to produce a desired cell type [116].",
        "The Wnt signaling pathway can also be harnessed to generate iPSCs from mouse fibroblasts. The genomic integration of the retroviruses, particularly with the gene c-Myc, increases the risk of tumorigenesis [117], and thus scientists are researching substances to replace c-Myc. The soluble small molecule Wnt modulates the Wnt signaling pathway, promoting up to a 20-fold increase in efficiency of the c-Myc retrovirus containing the OSKM factors [118]. Pharmacological activation of Wnt signaling with a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibitor has been shown to favor maintenance of pluripotency in human and mouse ESCs [119], and Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been shown to regulate stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in dual dosage-dependent functions [120]. Additionally, the Wnt signaling pathway effector protein TCF3 - which colocalizes with the ESC core transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog - has been shown to modulate the equilibrium between ESC pluripotency and differentiation [121]. RA can inhibit the canonical Wnt pathway and positively modulate Akt/mTOR signaling. Thus, two antagonistic effects of retinoic acid are present in hiPSCs: the resistance to the differentiation of hiPSCs as well as the improvement of the pluripotency state [122].",
        "Signaling pathways mediating induction of a neuronal fate in ESCs can be controlled by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and Wnt signaling [123], with the specific neuron fate being determined by exogenous patterning signals, such as Wnt, BMP, Sonic hedgehog, FGF, and retinoic acid [122]. In response to these signals, ESCs can differentiate into a variety of neural cell types depending upon their position along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes of the body or spinal cord [123].",
        "Signaling pathways can alter PSC states profoundly [124]. Promoting a self-renewing state in mouse ESCs is subject to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and BMP pathway signaling [125]. Self-renewal of hESCs and mouse epiblast-derived stem cells requires transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/activin/nodal signaling [126] and rat iPSCs and human iPSCs can be maintained with LIF in the presence of a TGF-β pathway inhibitor to prevent stem cell differentiation [127].",
        "Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is important for cell cycle progression, proliferation, and differentiation, and also contributes to carcinogenesis. ERK interventions have had seemingly paradoxical effects on stem cells. That is, the activation of ERK signaling has been shown to support maintenance of mouse ESC pluripotency; conversely the inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling with a MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase) inhibitor has also been shown to support self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse ESCs [128]. Additionally, mouse ESCs have been shown to be affected strongly by both MEK and GSK3 signaling [129] and simultaneous inhibition of the MEK and GSK pathways can obviate LIF and BMP requirements in PSC induction. ERK signaling has been shown to activate a shift in pluripotent ESCs from a self-renewal state to a lineage obligated state [130]. Consequently, by hindering lineage fate determination induced by the ERK signaling pathway, ESCs can be maintained in a self-renewing state [131]. The complex, and sometimes seemingly contradictory effects of ERK/MAPK interventions, could indicate a dual role of ERK/MAPK wherein, on one hand, a minimum threshold level may be required for stem cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, suppression of apoptosis, telomere length maintenance, and genomic stability. On the other hand, ERK/MAPK may repress self-renewal of mouse ESCs through downregulation of pluripotency factors and activation of developmental genes [128].",
        "Both hESCs and mouse epiblast-derived stem cells require FGF (Yu and Thomson, 2008). Whereas hESCs require FGF2 for the preservation of an undifferentiated state [132], rat and human iPSCs can proliferate long-term without exogenous FGF2 [127]. In a model of iPSC induction involving oxygen concentration manipulation, FGF2 supplementation was shown to modulate expression of some pluripotency-related genes (e.g. Rex1, Lin28, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog) at the transcriptional, translational, and cellular localization level [133]. However, this short-term induction may be insufficient for achieving true pluripotency.",
        "Stem cells can be reprogrammed with various cocktails of small molecules such as the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid [134,135], vitamin C [136], sodium butyrate [135], and the GSK-3 inhibitor CHiR99021 [127] [137],, among others. Valproic acid has been shown to dedifferentiate neonatal foreskin fibroblasts when used in conjugation with only Oct4 and Sox2; interestingly, valproic acid can be substituted for the proto-oncogene c-Myc to prevent tumor formation [134]. Adding vitamin C to a valproic acid protocol was reported to yield approximately three times more colonies than valproic acid alone [136]. This vitamin C effect may be consequent to its promotion of DNA methylation. Sodium butyrate has been shown to be particularly effective for enhancing expression of the reprogramming factors Ssea1, Sox2, and Nanog, compared with valproic acid, trichostatin, and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AZA) in two pre-iPSC lines [135]. CHIR99021, when administered with Oct4 and Klf4 expression, can induce reprogramming of MEFs. Cotreatment of CHIR99021 with parnate (an inhibitor of lysine-specific demethylase 1) enables reprogramming of human primary keratinocyte transduced with Oct4 and Klf4. These findings suggest that a GSK-3 inhibitor may obviate the need for some transcription factors in both mouse and human cell reprogramming [127]. Together, the studies summarized above validate the principle that signal transduction pathways and transcription factors can be leveraged to reprogram adult, differentiated cells into a pluripotent state.",
        "The process of cell reprogramming involves epigenetic alterations, including histone modification, DNA methylation, and expression of non-coding RNAs – each leading to changes in gene expression and cell fate. The establishment, maintenance, and withdrawal from pluripotency requires precise synchronization of a cell’s molecular apparatus. Considerable progress has been made in decoding several features of this intricate system, particularly with respect to transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers, as described above. In addition, RNA binding proteins mediate posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression that affects the fate of PSCs [138]. Another similar direction of cell reprogramming improvement is the use of microRNAs, which play a critical role in stem cell reprogramming and maintenance [139].",
        "Recently, a novel stem cell culture system was discovered, termed the 5iLAF culture system. It can be used to promote naïve pluripotency in diverse types of human cells from pre-implantation embryos, to primed pluripotent stem cells, to somatic cells [140–142]. Interestingly, experiments combining a human inducible reprogramming system with the 5iLAF naïve induction platform have revealed unique transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics during human fibroblast transition to naïve iPSC. Further, they revealed previously unrecognized modes of gene network activation similar to those found during embryonic development from late embryogenesis to pre-implantation [143]. This data of naïve-induction process dynamics represent the first molecular roadmap during the reprogramming of human somatic cells into a naïve pluripotent state.",
        "Global analysis data have revealed multiple pathways that provide specific regulation of mRNA decay in iPSCs, first by increasing the stability of histone mRNAs, second by stabilizing a large set of zinc finger protein mRNAs, and third by the destabilization of 3’UTR C-rich sequence elements in iPSCs [144]. These mechanisms underscore the importance of posttranscriptional regulation in pluripotent cells. A recently discovered class of small non-coding RNAs called Piwi-interacting RNAs have been reported to play important roles in transposon silencing, transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic modification. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression, modulation of genome stability, and regulation of chromatin status by Piwi-interacting RNAs may offer a new avenue for efficient reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state [145].",
        "The microRNA mir-302, which is highly expressed in hESCs, has also been implicated in reprogramming [146]; and the let7 family of microRNAs has been associated with LIN28’s down-regulation functions that promote reprogramming [147,148]. A screening study of candidate factors that might affect reprogramming efficiency revealed that p53 small interfering RNA and undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1 enhanced the efficiency of iPSC generation from human fibroblasts by up to 100-fold, even when c-Myc was removed from OSKM formulas [108]. Small interfering RNAs or lentiviral short hairpin RNAs against Dnmt1 have also been shown to be sufficient to induce rapid transition of MCV8 and BIV1 cells from a partially reprogrammed state to a pluripotent state [91].",
        "In summary, there are many promising new reprogramming techniques and direct delivery methods, including synthetic mRNAs expressing pluripotency genes. RNA modification of the expression of genes involved in reprogramming leading to the delivery of transcription factors may replace exogenous transcription factors or enhance reprogramming efficiency [33]. Compared with Yamanaka's method, the administration of synthetic mRNAs encoding OSKM can yield a 36-fold increase in reprogramming efficiency [100]. For synthetic mRNA encoding the OSKM factors, the open reading frame (ORF) of the gene of interest is flanked by a 5′ untranslated region (UTR) containing a strong Kozak translational initiation signal, and an alpha-globin 3′ UTR terminating end with an oligo(dT) sequence for addition of the polyA tail. Thus, synthetic RNA has come to be considered a safe and efficient method of transcription factor induction for iPSC generation.",
        "Recently, chemical approaches have been developed for controlling the pluripotency and differentiation of stem cells. The classical targets for these molecules are growth factor receptors or their associated downstream kinases that regulate intracellular signaling pathways during differentiation. For example, a small-molecule antagonist of cell-surface glycosaminoglycans promotes a pluripotent state in mouse ESCs, providing a powerful new alternative to previously existing techniques for controlling stem cell fate [149].",
        "In conventional somatic cell reprogramming without the addition of chemicals, many cells are left in an intermediate partially reprogrammed state. Supplementation of culture media with chemicals was developed to improve the efficiency obtained with reprogramming genes and with induction of the reprogramming process as a whole. The strategic combination of transcription factor transduction and chemical additives may be used to produce novel pluripotent cell types. This direction is currently an exceptionally promising area of study owing to its high efficacy, complete evasion of genomic integration, and minimization of disturbing genetic patterns.",
        "In 2011, the CHALP molecule cocktail was reported by Yu et al. to be effective in reprogramming experiments [102]. The CHALP cocktail includes six small molecules: a GSK3β inhibitor (CHIR99021), a MEK inhibitor (PD0325901), human LIF, TGF-β/activin/nodal receptor inhibitor (A-83-01), bFGF, and a ROCK inhibitor (HA-100). Recently, another cocktail protocol has been described by Di Li in 2016 that it contains cyclic pifithrin-a (a P53 inhibitor), A-83-01, CHIR99021, thiazovivin, NaB, and PD0325901—significantly improvubg the reprogramming efficiency with 170-fold increase in human urine-derived cells (hUCs) [150]. The biological effects of the two cocktail protocols are complex. Combined treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 and LIF promotes ground state pluripotency in Oct4 and Klf4 pre-iPSCs [124]. Notably, PD0325901 augments iPSC production from critically transduced neural progenitor cells, promoting pluripotency and the iPSC state. It also selectively binds and inhibits MEK, which may cause inhibition of phosphorylation and activation of MAPK/ERK and thus inhibits of tumor cell proliferation [102] [151] [152],., PD0325901 promotes the growth of iPSCs while inhibiting the growth of non-iPSCs [153]. A-83-01 favors reprogramming of human epidermal keratinocytes using Oct4 and Klf4 by inhibition of TGF-β (smad2) [102,152]. Cyclic pifithrin-α functions to suppress or silence P53, thus considerably augmenting the reprogramming proficiency of human somatic cells [154]. Thiazovivin is ROCK inhibitor, which intensely increases reprogramming efficiency in the presence of PD, Chir, A-83-01, and hLIF [102]. Sodium butyrate stimulates miR302/367 clusters, histone H3 acetylation, DNA demethylation, and the expression of endogenous pluripotency-associated genes [155] [156],. Thus, each of these chemicals promotes the generation of a pluripotent state.",
        "The pharmacological inhibition of DNA methyltransferases with AZA [91,157] can be used to propel pre-/partial-iPSCs toward fully realized iPSCs [82]. Valproic acid (discussed above) or AZA can also increase the kinetics of reprogramming resulting in faster attainment of fully proficient iPSCs. Valproic acid also empowers effective induction of PSCs without introduction of the oncogene c-Myc [134]. Valproic acid is recognized for its ability to improve reprogramming efficiency by more than 100-fold, as indicated by an Oct4-GFP reporter [84]. Other histone deactylase inhibitors, such as trichostatin A (up to 15-fold increase in efficiency with OSKM) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (∼2-fold increase in efficiency with OSKM), also augment reprogramming efficiency [84]. Another small-molecule combination, BIX-01294 (G9a histone methyltransferase inhibitor) and BayK8644 (L-type calcium channel agonist), enable reprogramming of Oct4/Klf4-transduced MEFs [157]. The glucocorticoid analogue dexamethasone increases the effect of AZA by 2.6-fold during induction of mouse fibroblasts to iPSCs [134].",
        "In summary, bioactive chemicals are being used to enhance reprogramming or even to replace core reprogramming factors. These factors hold exciting potential to significantly advance the field of stem cell and regenerative medicine.",
        "A great variety of factors, including the cell’s genetic makeup (genotypes) and external factors (environmental epigenetics), may produce previously unobtained phenotypes. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modification, can be initiated exogenously to produce enduring variations in gene expression and thus influence phenotype [158]. These modifications may be a driver of chromosomal aberrations, mitochondrial mutations, genetic diversification, and epigenetic variance [159]. They increase biological plasticity that shapes future gene expression in response to changing environments and conditions, including disease development. Similarly, genetic and epigenetic factors can modulate differentiation tendency in PSCs. These principles apply to iPSCs that were reprogrammed from mature cells as well [159].",
        "There may be genetic and epigenetic variations among different iPSC lines [160]. Dissimilarities may be inherited from donor somatic cells or produced during reprogramming or culturing [160]. There is evidence that epigenetic memories or incomplete reprogramming may disturb iPSC differentiation properties [161] [162],. If aspects of the genome associated with iPSC properties are affected, the functional activity of iPSC derivatives may be impaired, a mixed population of differentiated cells may be obtained, there may be residual undifferentiated cells, and there could be an increased risk of tumorigenicity [161] [162],. Thus, reprogramming strategy and culture conditions must be optimized to minimize such variations [163].",
        "Utilization of PSCs in regenerative therapy will require pluripotency with unrestricted self-renewal but without concomitant chromosomal instability [164]. Maintenance of telomere length is crucial for unrestrained self-renewal, pluripotency, and chromosomal stability of PSCs. In addition to telomerase, which plays a key role in telomere maintenance, there are several pathways required for telomere lengthening that are linked to genetic recombination and epigenetic modifications. Telomere reconstruction is an aspect of epigenetic reprogramming that is vital to pluripotency. Understanding telomere reprogramming and maintenance in PSCs has ramifications for aging and tumorigenesis [164]. Telomeres preserve chromosome constancy and cell replicative capability. Telomere length is determined by the balance between telomere elongation and telomere reduction [165]. The reprogramming of differentiated cells induces T-circle and single-stranded C-rich telomeric DNA accumulation, which activates telomere trimming pathways that compensate for telomerase-dependent telomere elongation. Telomeres are longer in PSCs than in somatic cells, and telomere elongation through reprogramming is critical for achieving authentic pluripotency [166]. SIRT1, a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent lysine deacetylases, plays a key role in proficient telomere elongation and genomic stability of iPSCs [167], while telomerase reverse transcriptase is used in somatic cell reprogramming [168].",
        "Experiments have demonstrated that iPSCs and hESCs exhibit similar defense mechanisms and mitochondrial regulation processes to prevent the production of DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species, which confer cells with comparable competencies to sustain genomic integrity [169]. The DNA damage response is critical for maintaining genomic integrity. PSCs derived through more effective reprogramming approaches hold additional hESC-like activated c-Myc signatures as well as DNA damage response signaling [170]. A faithful c-Myc molecular signature could serve as a biomarker of genomic integrity in hiPSCs. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 regulates multiple events in hiPSCs ranging from mitosis regulation, G2/M checkpoint maintenance, apoptosis, maintenance of pluripotency, and genomic stability [171].",
        "Failure to repair double-strand breaks in DNA not only compromises the capability of stem cells to self-renew and differentiate but can lead to genomic instability and eventually disease. Two properties of PSCs in the early reprogramming phase may compromise genomic stability [172]. The first property is that PSCs have a high proliferation rate and a short G1 phase in the cell-cycle [173]. The second is that PSCs profoundly depend on anaerobic glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation [174]. Furthermore, during the cellular reprogramming process, reduced mitochondria activity is insufficient to remove reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by increased cell proliferation, thus resulting in oxidative stress. Consequently, challenges exist during the proliferation and differentiation phases as well.",
        "Relative to somatic cells, ESCs have distinct mechanisms for defending against double-strand breaks and oxidative stress [175]. ESCs represent the point of origin of all cells to develop organism and thus, must protect their genomes from both endogenous and exogenous genotoxic stress. A vigorous DNA repair response to endogenous and exogenous stress is vital to sustain the genomic integrity of ESCs and guarantee accurate differentiation program. However, during reprogramming, iPSCs seem to be susceptible to genotoxic stress. ESCs have specialized mitochondrial features, but fewer and poorly defined mitochondria, when compared with mature cells [175]. Thus, ESCs display hypersensitivity to DNA damage [176]. This being said, ESCs can control intracellular ROS concentrations [177] and they have exclusive mechanisms to uphold a highly error-free form of DNA double-strand breaks repair. However, DNA double-strand breaks response may not be completely processed in all iPSCs throughout reprogramming. DNA single-strand breaks resulting from ROS and other agents can lead to double-strand breaks during replication. Further, DNA double-strand breaks-associated with the DNA damage response may be associated with ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and other gene ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-independent mechanisms. Such mechanisms are imperative in ESCs to preserve high genetic integrity under genotoxic stress [178]. Thus, adequate responses to stress and harm are critical for the maintenance of stem-cell self-renewal, differentiation capacity and genomic stability for stem cells. However, this presents a unique challenge for iPSCs.",
        "Genomic instability of iPSC can occur at any processing stage, causing mutations of the final cell products, which may have implications for clinical transplantation. Recently, in 2017, Yoshihara et al., summarized the genomic instability of iPSCs, thus challenging their potential clinical applications [179]. They found at least three origins for such genomic instability: (a) pre-existing variation, where changes in allele frequencies (~50%) in parental somatic cells may be caused by a cloning step during iPSC generation; (b) reprogramming-induced mutations, whose allele frequencies are 25% and 12.5% after first- or second-cell division, respectively; and (c) passage-induced mutations arise during prolonged culture at low allele frequencies. Thus, genomic instability can pose significant challenges for iPSC integrity.",
        "In 2019, Doss and Sachinidis first proposed the ten minimum quality criteria required for clinical-grade iPSCs and their differentiated products [180]. These include: (1) sterility, cGMP, and freedom from mycoplasma and other endotoxins; (2) expression of pluripotency-associated marks such as Nanog, Oct4, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, and Sox cannot be detected; (3) expression of differentiation markers must be unique to the therapeutic cellular product; (4) normal karyotype and absence of chromosomal aberrations must be present; (5) the absence of undifferentiated iPSC in the final cellular drug product and freedom from tumorigenicity as confirmed by in vivo teratoma assay and whole-genome and exome sequencing, as well as flow cytometry; (6) 100 % purity of the therapeutic cellular product without any contaminating foreign lineage cell types; (7) in vivo data on cell engraftment showing durability and functional improvement in preclinical models; (8) no residual reprogramming transgenes and vectors can be detected by whole-genome or exome sequencing; (9) genotyping in cases of autologous iPSCs can be demonstrated by short tandem repeat analysis; and (10) viability must be present in the context of clinical-grade stem cell products.",
        "Genetic factors may modulate iPSC fate, including whether a desired normal cell phenotype (e.g. neuron or cardiomyocyte) or undesired cell phenotype, such as a non-specific or cancerous type of cell, is obtained. Such influences can be biologically significant in the context of clinical translation of iPSC and and iPSC-derived cell protocols. If transplanted cells develop into undesired cells, such as non-specific normal cells or cancer cells, or migrate to unintended places, there could be serious health consequences. Thus, the maintenance of pluripotency and genomic stability in iPSCs is critical for the safety of downstream clinical applications.",
        "Employing iPSCs in research and clinical applications will require the ability to modify pluripotency and genomic stability. In addition to reprogramming with small molecules, microRNAs, and reprogramming factors, there has been a recent interest in modifying the genomic stability of stem cells to create disease models by combining two advanced technologies: hiPSC generation and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/CRISPR-associated gene (Cas) technologies [181]. The state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing method has revolutionized biomedical research, stem cell biology, and human genetics. It enables gene expression to be modified through CRISPR interference or CRISPR activation by reversibly directing a target endogenous promoter. It provides a means of introducing reporter genes or achieving ectopic expression. With CRISPR/Cas protocols, genetic information can be deleted or inverted by single base-pair changes that introduce a mutation or polymorphism, or even repair a disease-relevant mutation. Parallel differentiation of CRISPR/Cas genetically engineered hiPSCs and wild-type cells (for comparison) provides a basis for phenotypic analysis of disease-specific cellular pathologies. This approach can reduce animal model usage and save time and money, while also improving quality control with respect to reproducibility and stability. A series of CRISPR-Cas9 system experiments demonstrated the role of the jumonji and AT-rich interaction domain-containing 2 genes in self-renewal in hESCs [182]. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was shown to enable scarless introduction or correction of disease-associated variants in hPSCs, thereby combining genome editing and stem cell technologies to construct genotypic “disease-in-a-dish” models [183,184]. Such genome-editing approaches are referred to as scarless because they are applied to genotype-specific disease models using only intended DNA base-pair edits without extra-genomic modification. The genomic stability of stem cells can also be modified with CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to generate new disease models as novel areas of research [183,184]. These methods can be used to establish precision disease models for drug screening, making them highly promising for regenerative medicine.",
        "For clinical translation, culturing iPSCs in feeder-free conditions is of utmost importance [185] (see Table 2). Thompson’s gold-standard self-renewal culture technique calls for placing iPSCs (mouse or human) on a monolayer of feeder-cells, such as primary mitotically inactivated MEFs [3]. Long-term maintenance of hPSC cultures was accomplished using scalable, stable, and cost-effective poly(acrylamide-co-propargyl acrylamide)-coated polystyrene flasks with coupled cRGDfK coating (with modifying two-polymer brush coating [poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) and poly(acrylamide-co-propargyl acrylamide)] [186]. Although Matrigel is a beneficial substitute material for culturing hPSCs [187] [188],, it is derived from a mouse source [189]. Other matrices, such as CellStart [190,191], recombinant proteins [192] [193,194],, and synthetic polymers [195] [196], that do not involve animal-derived products are preferred for use when culturing iPSCs.Table 2Critical comparisons of cell culture, medium, and material for iPSCs growing environmentFeeder-free cell cultureXeno-free mediumBiomaterialsDefinitionPlates, wells, and culture are cell-free with the exception of the desired cell type.Serum-free cultureMaterial, mechanical, or biological technologies for coating plates/wells to promote growth, maintenance, or differentiation [219]Key SubstancesThompson’s inactivated MEFs (gold standard) [3]No animal-derived elements, but contain minimal growth factors [199]Biodegradable polyester-based materials [210] [211], and nano-/microparticles formulated from poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid with FDA approval [212] [213],AdvantagesMEFs secrete vital growth factors including FGF, TGF-β, cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (e.g. activin A, laminin-511, and vitronectin) [320] [321],To avoid contaminating cultures with unknown proteins or zoonotic viruses; to manage appropriate growth factors for forced differentiation or therapy [197]May improve safety, efficiency, and scalability limitations of conventional iPSC derivation by controlling iPSC behavior in vitro and in vivo [261]Other requirementsNeed growth-suppressive (mitotically inactivated) treatments such as mitomycin, γ-irradiation, electric pulses, or chemical fixation [322]Insulin, transferrin, and selenium [199]Low toxicity and biodegradabilityRisksMay contaminate cultures with unknown proteins or zoonotic viruses [322,323]; MEF expression and secretion of growth factors are inconsistent; Anti-proliferation treatments may lead to apoptosis [321,324,325]Potentially disrupt differentiation or therapeutic capacity [197]To identify and characterize biomaterial properties that are compatible, promotable, non-toxic, and degradable for the transplantSolutionsSynthetic culture surfaces such as recombinant human vitronectin-N–coated dishes or biomaterial coating [326]Xeno-free nutrition supplements such as ThermoFisher Scientific N2 (A1370701) and B27 (A3353501)The development of novel biomaterials",
        "Critical comparisons of cell culture, medium, and material for iPSCs growing environment",
        "iPSC culture media should also be well defined, xeno-free, and serum-free, all of which may improve stem cell differentiation capacity [197] (see Table 2). Numerous studies have shown successful stem cell culturing under xeno-free conditions. For instance, use of a growth factor-free, chemically-defined medium was reported to be important for the induction of rostral hypothalamic-like progenitor cells from neuroectoderm-derived mouse ESCs [198]. Meanwhile, PI3K/AKT- and Ras/MAPK-dependent signaling pathways were reported to sustain pluripotency and viability in hiPSCs cultured on Laminin-511 in serum-free medium [199]. Dissociation with serum-free EDTA/PBS has also been reported to produce small cell aggregates with high survival efficiency and cryopreservation in a time-efficient manner [200].",
        "Scalable microcarrier-based manufacturing using xeno-free media and bioreactors can also be used to generate mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) [201]. The inability of two-dimensional planar technology to produce cells of adequate quality and quantity necessitated a shift to serum-free microcarrier cultures, which require optimization of several factors including tissue source, medium formulation, microcarrier type and matrix, and agitation regime. Optimizing these parameters is critical for successful bioreactor-scale production of MSCs for cell therapy [202].",
        "Clinical grade MSC production adhering to cGMP and quality control standards are needed to ensure the delivery of cell therapies that are safe, reproducible, and efficient. Human platelet lysate has been suggested to be the gold standard for human cell propagation, replacing animal serums in a growing spectrum of applications because it has abundant growth factors and cytokines in platelet granules. These can be released naturally by thrombin activation or artificially by frozen/thawed platelet lysis, sonication, or chemical treatment [203,204]. However, human platelet lysate may not be practical for daily laboratory work. There is significant concern over the risk of xenopathogen contamination, which would make hESCs unsafe for regenerative medicine [205]. Xeno-free products are being developed in an effort to obviate this risk [206].",
        "There is ongoing debate regarding whether the surrounding space in stem cell cultures should be static (traditional method) or moving/stirred (novel method). ESCs can be cultivated in stirred microcarrier cultures, which represent a robust scalable pluripotent cell expansion system [207]. Such moving cultures can produce high concentrations of murine ESCs, 10-fold greater per medium volume, and 5-fold greater concentration per surface area, compared to static cultures. Furthermore, xeno-free microcarrier bioreactors have been engineered for stirred-suspension hPSC cultivation [208]. Microcarrier stirred-suspension bioreactors represent an attractive model for scalable hPSC expansion and differentiation. Although the precise mechanisms underlying the benefits of stirred stem cell culturing are not known, it is reasonable to suppose that cells have a distributed supply of nutrition owing to the circulation of medium. Additionally, the physical stimulation may favor growth. A fundamental base for three-dimensional (3D) cell culturing (discussed in a later section) has been developed based on these ideas [207,208]. Ongoing research is testing the proposition that moving cultures should replace static cultures.",
        "Biomaterials—that is, materials that intermingle with biological systems [209] can provide an effective experimental strategy for iPSC research and application (see Table 2). Biomaterial strategies may provide novel approaches to minimizing risks related to residual undifferentiated iPSCs or malignant transformation after transplantation [210] [211] [212] [213],., ,Additionally, these platforms may improve reprogramming efficiency and factor delivery [214] [215],. In addition to genetic factors, signaling molecules, small molecules, microRNAs, and chemicals as discussed above, biomaterials offer a promising approach to increasing reprogramming efficiency and scalability. Upon reprogramming, iPSC growth and differentiation can be improved by using a stem cell niche, that is, an environment that mimics the natural microenvironment of stem cells and thereby modulates stem cell phenotype development, proliferation, and differentiation [216]. A stem cell niche may include defining ECM structures, 3D architecture, chemical and mechanical signals, and cell-to-cell interactions [217,218]. Additionally, biomaterials can govern the kinetics of reprogramming factors via nanoparticle- and microparticle-based systems [219–221], and they can regulate stem cell fate and function [219] [221],. Biomaterials may also be employed to facilitate iPSC transplantation [222] [223] [224],.,",
        "Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel has shown particularly good efficacy in encouraging long-term iPSC expansion with a high growth rate, adequate purity, and fidelity of pluripotency in a fully defined and scalable 3D culture system for human PSC expansion and differentiation [225]. In addition, this hydrogel was shown to support differentiation into cells from all three germ layers as well as teratoma formation following long-term expansion in vitro and in vivo, respectively [226]. The robustness of this system was validated in multiple hESC lines.",
        "Modifiability and reasonable scalability can be achieved with the various biomaterials that are currently available, overcoming to some extent the limitations of traditional substrates without bioactive materials. Of all investigated biomaterials, the synthetic polymer-based expansion platform have proven to be extremely valuable for establishing stem cell culture scalability [227] [228],. Furthermore, combining synthetic substrates with biomolecules, such as growth factors, may encourage iPSC development by enhancing material interface-mediated signaling, which is critical for stem cell self-renewal. For instance, LIF on polyester fiber substrates [229] or surfaces pre-engineered with a growth factor linker [230] presented substantial benefit for ESC expansion in the presence of a small number of growth factors. Recent data have suggested that LIF plays an important role in neuronal development. For example, LIF-dependent induced primitive neural stem cells can be expanded to >100 passages, and with such long-term culturing these cells can differentiate into motor neurons, dopaminergic neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, indicating a high level of plasticity [231]. Alternatively, iPSC self-renewal can be promoted on standard tissue culture grade polystyrene substrates by attaching substrate-induced protein adsorption/cell adhesion without supplementary chemical modifications [232].",
        "Furthermore, mechanical biomaterials, such as matrices, can regulate the differentiation of PSCs. Artificial bioengineered peptides are alternatives to scaffolding ECM components. A genetically engineered ECM protein product, consisting of integrins and cadherins, can provide efficient coating on hydrophobic tissue culture plates, providing a novel approach for iPSC expansion in vitro [233]. The mechanical properties of the underlying matrix promote robust differentiation of hESCs into neurons without neurogenic factors [234]. Moreover, engineered natural and synthetic surfaces with topographical features can be used to augment iPSC adhesion, induce neuronal differentiation, and direct axon growth [235] [236,237],. Cell-to-cell interactions and cell-to-ECM interactions, such as through laminin or collagen, have been shown to influence neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells [238]. Conversely, recombinant human laminin 521 stabilizes hESC pluripotency [239].",
        "To improve the effectiveness of neural-inductive moieties and promote iPSC neurogenesis, biomaterials can be chemically enhanced. For example, synthetic neurotransmitter analogs have been added to promote neuronal-fate differentiation of iPSCs [240] [241],. Promising practical advances include biomaterials that can control the presentation of neuron-inductive growth factors in a sustained fashion. For instance, since a mussel adhesive protein at mussel adhesive pads can promote attachment to virtually any type of organic or inorganic material, the mussel biomimetic approach has been applied to surface modification to yield efficient human neural stem cell differentiation and proliferation [242]. In addition, hybrid-polyester scaffolds with heparinized surfaces support neuronal differentiation of iPSCs [243].",
        "To accomplish large-scale iPSC expansion (billions of cells) for downstream applications, including clinical applications, the aforementioned synthetic substrates could be engineered into microcarrier/suspension bioreactor systems [244]. Moreover, synthetic materials can be customized easily into high-throughput platforms [195] [245],. The use of high-throughput biomaterials/ECM screening technologies [195,246] with computational modeling [247] can empower current and future research.",
        "The development of 3D cell technologies for iPSC protocols has emerged as an exciting new field. For example, 3D ESC spheroids have been shown to produce efficient mesoderm induction in the presence of approximately 1/12th the amount of total growth factors in traditional iPSC cultures [248]. Compared to 2D monolayers, 3D culture systems offer the benefits of native cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions that improve the efficiency of spatial-temporal signals [249] [250], essential for cell proliferation and functioning [251]. Additionally, 3D culture platforms augment the space available for cell proliferating, thus enabling a scaling up of iPSC expansion without triggering the formation of unfavorable clusters and yielding higher cell densities and larger spheroids than 2D systems [252]. Expansion of iPSCs has been proven to be highly efficient in 3D scalable, synthetic platforms [225].",
        "The approaches reviewed above may improve the utility and effectiveness of iPSC growth and directed differentiation into desired functional cell subtypes. Biocompatible chemically demarcated synthetic controllable substrates can serve as next-generation substrates for large-scale iPSC production with cGMP compliance, which is well-suited for real-world clinical applications [253] [254],. Synthetic, scalable, chemical 3D matrices are a highly promising platform for both basic scientific investigation and clinical iPSC applications.",
        "In recent years, 3D bioprinting has attracted attention for its promise in the manufacture of iPSC-derived organ systems. It allows layer-by-layer prearrangement of biomaterials, biochemicals, and living cells with accurate spatial control [255] [256],, thereby mimicking the systemic complexities of physiological or pathological conditions [257] [258],. This technology is based on living cell cultures, biocompatible materials, and supporting instruments, including computer-controlled high-throughput technology. Efforts are well underway to produce 3D functional tissues and organs that can be used for tissue modeling (“organ-on-a-chip”) applications and clinical transplantation [146] [259] [260],., Such developments offer a potential future solution to the insufficient donor tissues and organs available for liver, heart, and vascular transplantation. Organ-on-a-chip platforms are useful for toxicological and pharmacological testing new candidate drugs on target tissues. Biomaterials provide microenvironmental elements for living cells, the backbone for the printed constructs, and protect living cells during printing [261] [262],. The advantages of 3D bioprinting have been fully demonstrated in fugitive/sacrificial and cell-laden hydrogel ink materials [263] and 3D bioprinting platforms are a promising tool for generating functional tissues or organs, which may be used for therapeutic drug screening, tissue morphogenesis research, and establishing physiological stem cell niches in 3D bio-printed iPSC arrays.",
        "The ultimate goals of stem cell technology is application in regenerative medicine, disease modeling, drug screening/discovery, and human developmental biology. Toward these aims, reprogramming technology to generate iPSCs has developed momentously in recent years. In neuroscience, this technology has the potential to treat SCI [264] [265] [266],,, brain injury [267] [268] [269],,, Alzheimer disease [270] [271],, PD [272], and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [273]. It has many advantages, including resolving cell shortages owing to readily accessible cell types (e.g. fibroblasts from biopsied skin or urine samples), being reprogrammed in culture, and personalization for clinical use, thereby obviating or reducing the need for immunosuppressive therapy and any associated risks [274] [275],.",
        "Another outstanding benefit of iPSCs is that some cell subtypes can be reprogrammed directly to generate in vitro disease models of cells compromised or destroyed by disease processes, such as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [273], sudden spinal cord trauma [264] [265] [266],,, and stroke [267] [268] [269],,, as well as models of cells subject to degenerative processes in Alzheimer disease [270] [271], and PD [272]. The iPSCs derived from a variety of genetic disease sources with Mendelian or complex inheritance (i.e. adenosine deaminase deficiency-related severe combined immunodeficiency, Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome, Gaucher disease type III, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, PD, Huntington disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, Down syndrome, and the carrier state of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) have been closely investigated [75] [272],. Such disease-phenotypic iPSC models can be used to recapitulate pathologic mechanisms and to investigate candidate drug, genetic, and cellular replacement therapies [276] [277],.",
        "For example, iPSCs derived from a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were directed to differentiate into replacement motor neurons for cell therapy [273]. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a mostly sporadic disorder (90%), but a few cases (10%) can be autosomal dominant and rarely X-linked or recessive [278]. More than 20 mutated genes have been identified, including SOD1 [279], TDP-43 and C9ORF72 [280].",
        "iPSCs can be differentiated from ALS somatic adult cells such as dermal fibroblasts by reprogramming factors that preserve pluripotency. Further, hiPSC differentiation into active motor neurons has been documented in vitro and in vivo [281,282]. Noticeably, in the asymptomatic SOD1G93A rat model, neural progenitors (NPs) has been successfully identified following injection of hiPSCs into the ventral horns of the lumbar spinal cord [283]. In this model, the potential iPSC-derived NPs survived for 10 days after intrathecal injection, increasing survival by 23 days following systemic intravenous cell infusion , when compared to control PBS injected mice [284]. Additionally, the protective trophic factors such as GDNF, BDNF, NT-3, and TGF-α were secreted in the transplanted cells to protect resident motor neurons and reduce astrogliosis [284]. To evaluate the efficacy of transplanted stem cell engraftment, advanced microscopy techniques such as confocal and two-photon microscopy could also be helpful tools when tracking in vivo models [285].",
        "Importantly, the limitations of these techniques include questions regarding administration route, optimal dose, differentiation state, neuroprotective mechanisms, as well as an appropriate time of cell injection according to disease onset [286]. Since various genes can be mutated in ALS [273], such as SOD1 [279], TDP-43, and C9ORF72 [280], each ALS model represents only a subpopulation of patients with ALS. Thus, future studies need to account for these limitations.",
        "Animal model studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of stem cells. For example, dopamine neurons derived from hESCs have been engrafted efficiently in animal models of PD [272]. hESC-derived retinal pigment epithelium has also been shown to improve vision in models of blindness [287], and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes have been shown to improve cardiac function in a porcine ischemic cardiomyopathy model [288].",
        "The ultimate goal of stem cell research is clinical application in patients. There are several ongoing stem cell clinical trials around the world, including studies targeting bone/cartilage, heart, neural, immune/autoimmune, kidney, lung, liver, gastrointestinal, and metabolic diseases [289] [290],. There is particular interest in hESC- and hiPSC-derived product studies focused on SCI, PD, macular degeneration, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and severe heart failure [289]. With respect to clinical trial phase, the largest portion, 40.6%, of 352 registered clinical trials are phase I/II with 26.0% being phase I, 22.5% phase II, 6.7% phase III, 3.8% phase II/III, and 0.3% being phase IV [290].",
        "The first clinical trial (ID: NCT01217008) to assess the safety of hESC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in SCI therapy was launched by Geron Corporation in 2010 with OPC1 cells, which were the first hPSC type isolated two decades ago by Dr. James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin [3]. The results obtained by Geron were presented at the American Society for Gene and Cell Therapy meeting in 2014 [290]. They showed no serious adverse events one year after transplantation in five participants and magnetic resonance imaging revealed alleviation of spinal cord deterioration in four of the participants. Asterias Biotherapeutic (AST) continued the Geron study from March 2015 to December 2018 (SciStar clinical trial, clinical trial ID: NCT02302157, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02302157). In preclinical safety experiments, cell culture and animal model data identified AST-OPC1 cells as an early-stage oligodendrocyte progenitor population capable of facilitating neurite outgrowth in vitro and myelination in vivo, without adverse sequelae, such as toxicities, allodynia, or tumorigenicity [291]. AST-OPC1 cells improved locomotor function (as indicated by automated TreadScan monitoring) when administered directly into the cervical spinal cord 1 week after SCI in rats; this functional improvement was accompanied by reduced parenchymal cavitation and increased myelinated axon sparing at the injury site [292]. All preclinical safety and efficacy data thus far support commencement of an AST-OPC1 Phase I clinical trial in patients with sensorimotor complete thoracic SCI.",
        "The SCiStar phase I/IIa study exploring a novel and innovative therapeutic approach is underway at nine US hospitals with 35 enrolled participants. It is an AST-OPC1 dose escalation study in SCI officially titled, “A Phase 1/2a Dose Escalation Study of AST-OPC1 in Subjects with Subacute Cervical Spinal Cord Injury”. The initial results (available on the company website at http://asteriasbiotherapeutics.com/) have demonstrated significant efficacy of this therapy for SCI, including improvements in running speed, forelimb stride length, forelimb longitudinal deviation, and rear stride frequency. All participants will have be followed up to 14 years to enable long-term evaluation of the effectiveness and any adverse secondary effects of the therapy.",
        "Taking a momentous step toward regenerative medicine with iPSCs, the first successful transplant of iPSC-derived retinal cells was performed in the eye of a 70-year-old woman suffering from advanced macular degeneration [293]. The patient received a transplant of ~250,000 retinal pigment epithelial cells generated from autologous iPSCs. After testing the tumorigenic potential of patient-28-RPE cells by using immunodeficient mice (nonobese diabetic/Shi-scid/IL2rγnull [NOG] mice), examining whole-genome sequencing for potential mutations, and investigating the integration of plasmid DNA into the host cell genomic DNA, all results demonstrated that transplanted cells were genetically stable. Additionally, there were no serious side effects and no sign of rejection during the 1-year study period in 2016. Recently, in April 2019, Masayo Takahashi and her team updated the 4-year follow-up [294]. The function of the grafted autologous iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelium cell sheet was evaluated by color fundus photography, spectral-domain OCT, fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, and an adaptive optics retinal camera. As a result, the cells have survived for 4 years, support and nourish photoreceptors and choroidal vessels, and display the morphologic characteristics of the retinal pigment epithelium at the transplant site. However, this study was a clinical case study rather than a real clinical trial, and thus, the safety and efficacy of this therapy need to be further investigated.",
        "Another major application field for iPSCs is the large-scale screening of chemical libraries for systemic disease-treating drug discovery. Several iPSCs derived from patients with neurological and psychiatric conditions are currently being investigated for drug screening [295]. An iPSC model of a fully penetrant aggressive form of PD (synuclein alpha triplication, encoding α-synuclein) has been established to identify compounds that reduce α-synuclein levels [296]. Additionally, human dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSCs carrying the most common PD-causing mutation (p.G2019S) in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) have been developed [297]. Importantly, they show increased expression of oxidative stress-response genes and α-synuclein protein. Several mitochondrial response metrics (reactive oxygen species, respiration, proton leakage, and intraneuronal mitochondrial movement) were assessed in iPSC-derived neural cells carrying PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) and LRRK2 mutations (from patients with familial PD), showing pharmacological rescue of mitochondrial deficits [298]. Such cells, originally differentiated from iPSCs that were derived from adult somatic cells, offer an attractive platform for drug and toxicity screening in preclinical trials. Added benefits of these techniques include reducing the use of animals and costs while saving time. For example, a 7-day high-throughput/high-content screening assay protocol for identifying compounds that affect hESC self-renewal and differentiation in 384-well plates has also been developed with some success [299].",
        "Another stem cell research area is neurodevelopmental disorder modeling in hPSCs [300] [301],. In neurodevelopmental disorders, nervous system growth and development are altered in utero and during early postpartum life. Because hPSCs maintain the unique genetic signatures of the individual from whom they were derived, they may be able to recapitulate, to some extent, that individual's characteristic neural development, including impairments in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis that may underlie intellectual disabilities and delayed neurodevelopment [300] [301],. iPSC technology can be used to study neurogenesis [302], that is, the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells into glia and neurons, which are then organized into exquisitely regulated functional networks. For example, bipolar disorder is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by pathological fluctuations in mood between mania and depression. Studies of iPSC lines from patients with bipolar disorder have revealed alterations in calcium signaling, neuronal differentiation, glial lineage specification, and some impairments associated with WNT, Hedgehog, and Nodal pathway signaling [303].",
        "Furthermore, combining stem cell technology with genomic editing tools such as CRISPR may establish an unprecedented modeling system in mammalian neural development and brain organoid research [304]. For instance, Huntington disease, a debilitating heritable condition, occurs because CAG repeats encode for glutamine in the huntingtin gene [305], wherein more repeats are associated with greater severity and an earlier age of onset. Combining organoid and CRISPR gene editing methods may help to elucidate the mechanisms of genetic repeat diseases [304]. In late 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui at The Second International Summit on Human Gene Editing in Hong Kong made an announcement that his team has successfully carried out human germline gene editing by using CRISPR technologies to create gene-edited twins to “prevent” HIV infection [the website of The Second International Summit on Human Gene Editing].",
        "Organ transplantation is considered the final therapy for organ failure, but there is an extreme shortage of organ donors, and transplantation requires donor-recipient matches. Thus, an alternative source of cells and tissues, such as iPSCs, could help to solve these challenges [306]. 3D stem cell structures built with biomaterials and bioprinting technology may enable organ reconstruction in the future [307]. Although complete, functional organs have yet to be reconstructed, parts of organs have been reconstructed, including partial livers [246] [308],, vasculature [309] [310],, bone [311] [312],, and proto-bladders [313] [314],. Organ reconstruction requires two parallel complementary stages: de-cellularization, during which the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and vascular network of the organ must be maintained after washing out and removing waste tissues with biochemical detergents, physical forces (e.g. agitation), and re-cellularization – during which the remnant organ scaffold retaining the full network of blood vessels and cohesive ECM is populated with stem cells or resident cells to regenerate the organ [315]. The goal is to produce an organ with exquisite replication of phenotypic traits and cellular signal transduction to allow functional integration of the regenerated organ. Whole-organ bioengineering for the liver, heart, lungs, and kidneys is highly challenging because of its very high structural and functional complexity. A detailed review of all of the technologies applicable to organ regeneration would be beyond the scope of this work [315] [316] [317],., Thus, only a conceptual overview has been provided.",
        "As described before, stem cell research with has great promise for medical applications. However, there are still challenges regarding technical matters. Besides this, other issues, including ethical dilemmas, need to be addressed. hESCs have been most widely used for basic and clinical research so far and thus have drawn significant attention regarding their ethical use. Such cells are directly taken from human tissues during pregnancy and abortion. Other challenges include immune rejection and depletion of cell resources after exogenous transplanting [318].",
        "To produce NTSCs, SCNT technology also faces challenges of ethical concerns, as well as substantial technology, facility, and finance requirements. SCNT technology first became controversial after Dolly in 1996, due to concerns that it might be applied to human cloning. In 2005, the United Nations declared a ban on “all forms of human cloning inasmuch as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life” [319]. Although human reproductive cloning is associated with serious ethical objections, some hope that the creation of a global governance framework based on knowledge sharing and shared feasibility testing via intergovernmental organizations and stakeholders can maximize benefits to humans while avoiding ethical concerns [319].",
        "iPSCs have noteworthy attributes compared with NTSCs and ESCs, including obviation of ethical issues and lower risks of immune rejection, contamination, and infection, as well as the ability to obtain large quantities for precision and personalized medicine. Despite the challenges that remain for iPSC clinical development, the advantages of iPSCs engender optimism regarding their feasibility and clinical potential. The first successful clinical case study of transplanting iPSC-derived retinal cells represents an advancement in stem cell-based regenerative medicine that avoided ethical concerns.",
        "Recently, in 2018, human germline gene editing without authorization has revived controversy and debate. The Second International Summit on Human Gene Editing in Hong Kong made an announcement that a team successfully carried out the human germline gene editing by using CRISPR technologies to create gene-edited twins to “prevent” HIV infection [the website of The Second International Summit on Human Gene Editing]. This resulted in significant ethical complaints worldwide. Gene editing in human embryos to prevent or correct diseases holds significant potential; however, the current immature status of this technology without strict regulation is dangerous to society. Thus, future research in this field will neeed to account for governmental, society, and scientific approval and permission.",
        "Stem cell technologies represent a breakthrough development in biomedical science. There is optimism that iPSC technologies in particular may provide cures for human diseases because they enable cells from adult tissues to be reprogrammed into an embryonic-like state, thereby avoiding the ethical issues associated with ESCs. The potential applications of iPSCs have been expanded by state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9 genetic alterations, biomaterials, and 3D printing. hiPSCs have the potential to be developed into a wide range of specific subtypes of cells and, when combined with tissue engineering, they can even develop into tissues and organs. hiPSCs and other stem cells may someday be used to deliver personalized therapies.",
        "In selecting an iPSC reprogramming method, it is important to minimize risk while maintaining pluripotency and the ability to direct specific cell fate development. As we have discussed, significant variation exists between reprogramming methods, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, non-integrating, self-excising, and non-viral vectors are more clinically applicable at present than integrating vectors (Fig. 1 and 2). Non-viral vectors enable transcription factor gene delivery without anomalous genetic modifications. Oct4 is the most important reprogramming gene, whereas Klf4 and c-Myc can be replaced with Nanog and Lin28. Of the various genetic factors, signaling molecules, small molecules, microRNAs, and chemicals used to enhance reprogramming efficiency, we favor the CHALP molecule cocktail by Yu’s protocol in 2011 [102] or the most recent 6-small-molecule cocktail by Li’s protocol in 2016 [150]. Harvesting stem cells from urine samples represents an attractive noninvasive means of obtaining cells for reprogramming. Along these same lines, stem cells have now been sustained for long periods of time in a non-differentiating state, after which they can be differentiated in xeno-free media. Similarly, progress has been made regarding high-throughput, scalable expansion and controlled differentiation in a bioreactor culture system for large-scale studies, cell therapy, and industrial applications.",
        "There are numerous technical and scientific challenges that need to be addressed before iPSC technology can be applied in a clinical setting. Beyond the primary concern of patient safety, there remains a need for consistent quality control and streamlined differentiation protocols and biomaterials for the translation of iPSCs into clinical applications [Fig. 1 and 2]. The field of stem cell and regenerative medicine is tremendously exciting and has the potential to someday revolutionize basic and clinical biomedical science.",

        "Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease caused by immune system disorders. Its prevalence is 60.82/100 000 people per year, and the average male-to-female ratio is 1:9 (Refs 1, 2). The main clinical manifestations of SS are dry mouth and eyes caused by the destruction of exocrine glands, such as the salivary and lacrimal glands. Approximately 30–40% of patients also have systemic manifestations, including synovitis, interstitial pneumonia, interstitial nephritis and vasculitis (Refs 1, 3). It is a unique disease known as primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), and when it is secondary to other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), it is called secondary Sjögren's syndrome) (Ref. 2). The risk of lymphoma in patients with pSS is approximately 5–10%. The main types are low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and marginal tissue band types, such as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALT) (Refs 1, 4).",
        "The pathogenesis of SS is complex and has not been fully elucidated (Fig. 1). Known factors include environmental, genetic and infection factors, and cases are characterised by over-activation of innate and adaptive immunity (Refs 1, 2, 5, 6). The interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, especially after infection with Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, coxsackie virus A and enterovirus, can activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as mononuclear macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) (Refs 2, 5, 7, 8). APCs have been shown to interact with T and B cells and stimulate the activation of T and B cells, resulting in T cells differentiating into different cell subsets and the secretion of a large number of inflammatory factors. The T cells can further activate B cells. While secreting a large number of inflammatory factors, B cells can differentiate into plasma cells to produce immunoglobulins (Igs) and autoantibodies (anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies, respectively), thereby causing tissue destruction and a series of various clinical symptoms (Ref. 5). Meanwhile, B cells are surrounded by T cells to form an ectopic germinal centre, which increases the risk of lymphoma in patients with pSS (Refs 5, 7).\nFigure 1.Pathogenesis and cell therapy of SS.

        "Currently, there are no approved drugs for the treatment of pSS, mainly for symptomatic treatment of dry mouth and eyes. Glucocorticoids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are used when systemic involvement occurs (Refs 7, 9). There are also some biological agents, such as B-cell-targeted therapy drugs, including rituximab, belimumab, epratuzumab and baminercept. T cell-targeting drugs include abatacept and alefacept, and cytokine-targeting drugs include infliximab and tofacitinib (Refs 7, 10, 11). Long-term use of glucocorticoids in traditional medicine can cause metabolic abnormalities, such as osteoporosis, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and central obesity, and may also lead to femoral head necrosis and infection. DMARDs have poor curative effects in some patients, have a long onset time and their long-term use increases the risk of infection. Biologics are fast-acting and have potent activity. Currently, biologic agents treat SS mainly in B cells. For example, multiple clinical trials of rituximab for SS have inconsistent results (Refs 12, 13, 14). Belimumab and ianalumab clinical studies have found that they can reduce the ESSDAI score and improve dryness, but there may be local injections of reaction to the wound to increase the chance of infection (Refs 13, 14); therefore, we still need to continue to explore the effectiveness of biological treatment and security. However, these treatments can only control inflammation, and they do not repair tissue damage. Therefore, identifying methods to regulate immune disorders while repairing damaged tissues are imperative.",
        "Cell therapy involves the transplantation of autologous or allogeneic normal or bioengineered cells into the body of a patient to replace damaged cells or achieve a stronger immunomodulatory capacity to cure diseases (Ref. 15). Cell therapy, a form of regenerative medicine that aims to repair damaged cells by reducing inflammation and regulating the immune system, has been widely used in autoimmune and blood system diseases and is gradually becoming a novel therapeutic approach. Cell therapies can be divided into stem- and immune cell therapies according to the cell type, showing prospective applications for various diseases. We have searched for articles related to this topic in the past 20 years through PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang, and other websites in order to review the research progress and prospects of cell therapy in SS (Fig. 1, Table 1).\nTable 1.Research on cell therapy in SSCell typeCell originAnimal/patientResultsReferencesHSCsAuto-SCTpSS complicated with interstitial lung diseaseDry eyes, shortness of breath, ESR, CRP, number and size of pulmonary nodules improvedRef. 19SS patients (Clinical Trials)Clinical symptoms continuously relieved, the overall survival rate was 90%, the progression-free survival rate was 70%Ref. 19SS complicated with MMNo change of SS (no progression MM)Ref. 20No improvement of SS (Relapse of MM, died)Ref. 21SS complicated with MALTDryness and salivary gland function not improved, continuous deterioration of salivary gland function, mild salivary gland fibrosis, lymphoma not relapseRef. 22SS complicated with immunoblastic lymphomaNo improvement of SS (died because of P. carnii pneumonia)Ref. 23MSCsBMMSCsNOD miceThe salivary flow rate, and lymphocyte infiltration in the gland improved, the number of Th17 and Tfh cells decreased, Th2 and Treg cells increasedRef. 26UCMSCsNOD miceThe salivary flow rate, and lymphocyte infiltration in the gland improved, the number of Th17 and Tfh cells decreased, Treg cells increased, the production of IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ downregulate, IL-10, TGF-β upregulateRefs 29, 30, 31LGMSCsNOD miceRef. 32UCMSCspSS patients (Clinical Trials) (NCT00953485)The salivary flow rate, SSDAI and VAS improved, serum antibodies decreasedRef. 26The serum IL-12 level of the patients, and DCs expression of IL-12 mRNA decreasedRef. 30BMMSCsUMMSCsSS patients (Clinical Trials) (NCT00698191)No adverse events were observed in the heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, nervous system, or haematological system after MSCs infusion for 1 month, and the malignant tumour was reported in one SSRef. 33ASCsSS patients (Clinical Trials) (NCT04615455)No results posted (phase 2)MSC-EVsLGMSC-ExosNOD miceThe salivary flow rate improved, the number and area of salivary gland lymphocyte infiltration foci reduced, the number of Th17 cells decreased, Treg cells increased, the expression of IL-17A, IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α decreased, TGF-β and IL-10 increaseRefs 32, 46pSS patients (in vitro)The proportion of plasma cells decreasedRef. 46UCMSC-ExospSS patients (in vitro)The autophagy level of CD4+T cells reduced, the number of Th17 cells decreased, Treg cells increased, the expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α decreased, TGF-β and IL-10 increasedRef. 47iPSCsiPSC-MSCsNOD miceLymphocyte infiltration and serum antibodies decreased, the expression of CD19, CD79a, CD79b, Ighg3, CD4, Fxop3, Icosl, and CD40 downregulated, IL-10 upregulatedRef. 64iPSC-MSC-EVsNOD miceLymphocyte infiltration, serum antibodies and B-cell-related gene expression decreasedRef. 64SGSCshSGSCsRadiation-damaged Wistar ratsThe body weight of the rats in the hSGSC group, the salivary flow rate increased, and the structure of salivary glands showed a compact acicular structure similar to that of the undamaged normal ratsRef. 72Immune cellCD19/BCMA chimeric antigen receptor T cellsPatients with refractory SS (Clinical Trials) (NCT05085431)No results posted (early phase 1)HSCs, haematopoietic stem cells; auto-SCT, autologous stem cell transplantation; pSS, primary Sjögren's syndrome; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; CRP, C-reactive protein; MM, multiple myeloma; MALT, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma; MSCs, mesenchymal stem cells; BMMSCs, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; TNF, tumour necrosis factor; TGF, transforming growth factor; UCMSCs, umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells; LGMSCs, labial gland-derived mesenchymal stem cells; ASCs, allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells; SSDAI, SS disease activity index; VAS, visual analogue scale; MSC-EVs, EVs released by MSCs; iPSCs, induced pluripotent stem cells; SGSCs, salivary gland stem cells.",

        "Stem cells can be classified as totipotent, pluripotent or monopotent based on their differentiation potential. Totipotent stem cells, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs), can become totipotent. They maintain their normal karyotype and pluripotency during the process of infinite proliferation and produce whole organisms. However their clinical application is limited owing to ethical concerns. Pluripotent stem cells, including haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Ref. 15) can proliferate indefinitely and differentiate into specific tissues but cannot produce whole organisms. Monopotent stem cells are organ-specific stem/progenitor cells, including salivary gland stem cells (SGSCs), skin stem cells and muscle stem cells, which are characterised by their differentiation into one or two closely related cell types. Although their differentiation ability is limited, they play a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity as progenitor cells that replenish aged and damaged cells (Ref. 16).",
        "HSCs are primarily found in the bone marrow, peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood, whereas human HSCs are primarily distributed in the bone marrow (approximately 1–5%) compared with its distribution in the peripheral blood (<0.1%). HSC transplantation, which includes autologous HSC transplantation (auto-HSCT) and allogeneic HSC transplantation (allo-HSCT), is a widely used cellular immune therapy (Ref. 17). For auto-HSCT, there are no major histocompatibility complex mismatches. The transplantation process of auto-HSCT is simpler, with fewer transplant-related complications and lower mortality (<1%) than allo-HSCT; however, the disease is prone to relapse (Ref. 17). Allo-HSCT transplantation is a complicated process with complex complications such as immune rejection after the transplantation, among which graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the most severe complication (Ref. 17). Auto-HSCT, used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, eliminates auto-reactive T cells and B cells through radiotherapy and chemotherapy and then infuses the obtained HSCs into the patient, thereby causing CD8+T cells and CD4+T cells to renew and establish new immune tolerance to reset the immune system (Ref. 18).",
        "SS lung involvement can be manifested as interstitial pneumonia, of which lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is the most common pathological type. One patient with pSS and LIP (Ref. 19) was reported; they had poor results after treatment with methylprednisolone, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and pilocarpine. After autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, 18 months of follow-up checks showed that the symptoms of dry eyes and shortness of breath, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein levels and number and size of pulmonary nodules had significantly improved. Choi et al. summarised 101 patients with simple SS treated with autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) (Ref. 19) and found that clinical symptoms were continuously relieved, with an overall survival rate of 90% and a progression-free survival rate of 70%. Patients with SS complicated by haematological diseases show different results after auto-SCT treatment (Refs 20, 21, 22, 23). In one case of SS with multiple myeloma (MM) (Ref. 20), the myeloma and SS were in complete remission. However, 6 months later, the patient had bilateral parotid and submandibular gland (SMG) enlargement with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia. A SMG biopsy confirmed the recurrence of SS, whereas the myeloma remained in complete remission. In another SS patient with MM and hyperamylasemia (Ref. 21), IgG and amylase levels decreased to normal, and plasma cells decreased in the bone marrow. However, 8 months later, IgG and amylase levels were elevated again, progressive anaemia and dry symptoms were significantly aggravated and the patient died. A patient with SS combined with MALT (Ref. 22) was found to have no recurrence of lymphoma but no improvement in dryness, continuous deterioration of salivary gland function and only mild salivary gland fibrosis after 3 years of follow-up. One patient with SS combined with immunoblastic lymphoma (Ref. 23) had complete remission, whereas the SS relapsed, and the patient died 20 months later because of Pneumocystis carnii pneumonia. In patients with pSS complicated by haematological malignant lesions, auto-SCT can improve the disease of the haematological system; however, the improvement in pSS is not apparent.",
        "Before the transplantation of HSCs, different pretreatment schemes should be selected for different patients, such as whole body-radiotherapy or chemotherapy, and chemotherapy drugs, including cyclophosphamide and melphalan. The different schemes have different toxicities and side effects and also have different impacts on patients; therefore, we need to constantly optimise the pretreatment schemes. In addition, infection, recurrence and disease deterioration may occur during the course of treatment; however, pretreatment has certain advantages, such as low immunogenicity, less chance of rejection after transplantation and rebuilding of a new immune system. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms of immune system rebuilding, which may become a new strategy for treating SS.",
        "As pluripotent stem cells, MSCs are widely found in various tissues of the body, such as the bone marrow, umbilical cord, fat, placenta, gingiva and skin (Ref. 24). Unlike HSCs, MSCs exhibit high proliferation, differentiation and immune-regulatory abilities. MSCs have a wide range of immunomodulatory functions (Refs 24, 25, 26, 27, 28). The first is their regulation of innate immunity; MSCs can inhibit the activation and maturation of DCs and mononuclear macrophages, induce the transformation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages and change the natural killer cell (NK) phenotype. Concomitantly, they weaken antigen presentation and pro-inflammatory function, which may be related to the indirect release of inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-inducing gene 6 and IL-1 receptor antagonist. In addition, they regulate adaptive immunity: MSCs inhibit the proliferation of T lymphocytes by upregulating the expression of negative cell cycle regulatory protein p27 and the activity of IDO, by producing NO, PGE2, TGF-β and hepatocyte growth factors. They inhibit the proliferation of CD4+T lymphocytes, downregulate the expression of Thl and Th17 cells and inhibit the secretion of the pro-inflammatory factors interferon-(IFN-)γ and IL-17A. They upregulate Th2 and Treg cells, promote the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β, and regulate the balance between Thl/Th2 and Th17/Treg. The proliferation and cytotoxicity of CD8+T lymphocytes can be inhibited by upregulating NO synthase. MSCs directly or indirectly release IDO through Th cells in the presence of IFN-γ, inhibiting B cell activation, proliferation, plasma cell differentiation, antibody production and chemokine receptor expression.",
        "In animal experiments, bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMMSCs), umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UCMSCs) and labial gland-derived MSCs (LGMSCs) were used to treat non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an SS animal model, and the salivary flow rate of mice was significantly improved, and the number and area of glandular lymphatic infiltrates were reduced (Refs 26, 29, 30, 31, 32). In vitro experiments have shown that BMMSCs (Ref. 26) drive CD4+T cells to differentiate into Tregs and Th2 cells, inhibit Th17 and Tfh differentiation and play an immunomodulatory role in improving salivary gland function in mice. UCMSCs (Refs 29, 30, 31) and LGMSCs (Ref. 32) induce Treg cell differentiation, reduce the number of Th17 and Tfh cells, inhibit the production of IL-6, IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, promote the production of IL-10 and TGF-β, inhibit T cell response and regulate Th17/Treg balance.",
        "In an SS clinical study, Xu et al. (Ref. 26) injected UCMSCs into 24 patients with SS. The results showed that the salivary flow rate significantly increased 1 month after UCMSC transplantation, and serum anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies significantly decreased. The SS disease activity index and visual analogue scale score improved significantly and were not observed before and after the infusion-related side effects. Shi et al. (Ref. 30) injected UCMSCs intravenously (1 × 106/kg body weight) into 10 patients with SS and found that serum IL-12 levels decreased. As DCs mainly secrete IL-12, the IL-12 mRNA also significantly decreased. On the Clinical Trials website, a clinical trial taking place at Copenhagen has been registered; it is a randomised, double-anonymised clinical trial investigating the efficacy of allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in improving tear fluid. The trial is still ongoing. In a study on the safety of MSCs in the treatment of 404 cases of autoimmune disease (Ref. 33), including 72 patients with SS who failed to respond to conventional treatment and were in the high-activity stage, MSCs were derived from the umbilical cord or bone marrow. Steroids and immunosuppressive drugs were administered during the back transfusion. No adverse events were observed in the heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, nervous system or haematological system after MSC infusion for 1 month. In the follow-up study, five patients developed malignant tumours, namely, two SLE, one RA, one SS and one SSc, and the types of malignant tumours were two lung cancers, two colorectal cancers and one bladder cancer. The appearance of malignant tumours is not an adverse event of MSC transplantation, but it is related to the dysfunction of specific effector cells or decreased secretion of TNF-α.",
        "In addition, MSCs can repair damaged tissues owing to their multidirectional differentiation potential. They differentiate into SGECs, acinar cells and vascular endothelial cells (Ref. 34). MSCs can also improve glandular function through their paracrine effects. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a growth factor secreted by the duct cells of salivary glands. It is involved in the growth, regeneration and maintenance of salivary glands and inhibits the apoptosis of salivary epithelial cells. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) promotes the re-epithelialisation of salivary glands. MSCs can effectively repair the salivary glands of NOD mice by increasing the expression levels of EGF and FGF-2 (Ref. 35). Additionally, human BMSCs differentiate into SGECs in a co-culture system, which can express various salivary genes, such as aquaporin 5 (AQP5), E-cadherin and α-amylase. A cell structure similar to that of SGECs, such as tight connections and numerous secretory particles, can be observed by electron microscopy (Ref. 24). In conclusion, MSCs have potential applications in repairing SS gland damage and for providing a new treatment method for SS.",
        "Although MSCs have considerable advantages in immune regulation and tissue repair, are widely available, safe and do not cause immune rejection, they have been extensively studied in SS. Nevertheless, many problems remain, such as infection, malignant tumours (Refs 36, 37), pulmonary capillary interception (Refs 38, 39) and ectopic osteogenesis (Ref. 40). In addition, the heterogeneity of MSCs from different sources, optimised preparation process and high cost of storage and transportation still need to be addressed to lay a good foundation for their clinical application in SS therapy.",
        "Studies have shown that MSCs release extracellular vesicles (EVs), either at rest or under stress. They are divided into exosomes (Exos), microparticles (MPs) and apoptotic bodies based on size (Ref. 25). MSC-EVs are lipid bilayer structures that can fuse with the target cell membrane through receptor–ligand interactions or endocytosis to transfer content and play a role in pathophysiological processes (Refs 25, 41, 42). MSC-EVs contain DNA, mRNA and miRNA, lipids, proteins, cytokines, chemokines and growth factors (Refs 25, 42, 43). MSC-EVs have immunomodulatory and tissue repair effects similar to those of MSCs. As the main components of EVs, Exos can simulate the immunoregulatory and tissue repair effects of MSCs, and their immunoregulatory effects are more potent than those of MPs (Ref. 44). It can quickly pass through capillaries when its size is reduced, has stable properties and a strong information transmission ability and does not decline over time. In addition, Exos can prevent problems caused by MSC treatment, such as ectopic osteogenesis, malignant tumour, pulmonary capillary interception and immune rejection.",
        "MSC-EVs exert immunomodulatory effects by delivering miRNAs and regulatory proteins. In this way, they can inhibit the proliferation and activation of T, B, NK and APCs, promote T cell apoptosis, upregulate Treg cells, promote the expression of IL-10 and TGF-β, downregulate the expression of Th17 cells and inhibit the expression of IL-17A. They can also induce the transformation of M1 macrophages into M2 macrophages. By delivering mRNA and miRNA, MSC-EVs can activate autophagy and/or inhibit cell apoptosis, necrosis and oxidative stress and upregulate EGF, FGF, vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, thereby promoting cell survival, regeneration and repair (Refs 25, 45).",
        "Studies have shown that LGMSC-Exos injected into mice through the tail vein (Refs 32, 46) can significantly improve the salivary flow rate and also the number and area of glandular lymphatic infiltration foci. Its therapeutic effect is similar to that of LGMSCs. Ma et al. (Ref. 47) found in vitro that UCMSC-Exos reduced the autophagy level of CD4+T cells in patients with pSS and also reduced their proliferation and apoptosis. The mechanism of action may be through inhibiting Th17 cell differentiation, inducing Treg cell proliferation, inhibiting the expression of IL-17A, IL-17F (Ref. 47), IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α, promoting the secretion of TGF-β and IL-10 and regulating the imbalance of the Th17/Treg cells. In addition, LGMSC-Exos reduce the expression of PR domain zinc finger protein 1 (PRDM1) by delivering miR125b and inhibiting plasma cell differentiation (Ref. 46), thereby reducing inflammation.",
        "Currently, there are few preclinical studies of MSC-EVs in SS (Ref. 25). EVs carry proteins and RNA from their parent cells, and the content of MSC-EVs varies with changes in donor cells. Indeed, the therapeutic effect depends largely on the donor, culture conditions and tissue source of MSCs (Ref. 45). Previous studies have shown that the content of EVs varies with changes in the parent cells owing to different culture conditions. Moreover, the biological characteristics of MSCs declined with in vitro amplification, and the effect of late-passage MSC-EVs was lower than that of early-passage MSC-EVs (Ref. 48). Thus, the clinical application of MSCs and their EVs from different tissue sources may be hampered by limited scalability and significant differences in biological characteristics owing to donor and culture conditions. The mechanism of action of MSC-EV needs to be explored in the future to provide a basis for the development of new potential cell-free therapies.",
        "Owing to the large size of MSCs, MSC-Exos easily remain in organs such as the spleen, lung and liver during delivery in vivo or are cleared by the blood circulation; to maintain their biological activity and allow controlled release, they need to be engineered (Ref. 49). Engineering modification methods include genetic, surface and tissue engineering. Genetic engineering includes gene modifications via transfection with viral and non-viral vectors (Ref. 50). Surface modification techniques include enzymatic, chemical and non-covalent modifications. Tissue engineering involves encapsulation in biological materials, among which nanocomposites are the most widely used (Refs 51, 52) and have applications in many areas of biomedicine, such as wound healing, bone and cartilage engineering, heart disease and neurological diseases (Ref. 51).",
        "Some studies have found that MSCs modified by genes can enhance their targeting ability and migration efficiency. However, their application is limited because the genomic integration of viral vectors may increase the possibility of tumour occurrence (Ref. 50).",
        "In recent years, there have been studies using transgenic MSCs expressing human soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 2 (Ref. 53), MSCs with hypomethylation agent epigenetic modification (Ref. 54), microcycle plasmid construction transfected (Ref. 55) or hydrogels (Ref. 56) to treat RA; the results showed that the engineered MSCs have a stronger effect on the inhibition of arthritis than simple MSCs. MSCs were modified to overexpress IL-37 and then transplanted into lupus mice, which improved lupus-related symptoms and survival rates (Ref. 57). Studies on SLE mainly used lentivirus transfection with MSCs, which improved the symptoms and survival rate of lupus mice (Ref. 57). You et al. (Ref. 58) found that after treatment of CIA mice with adipose-derived stem cells, MGE surface modification of MSC-Exos promoted the effective aggregation of engineered Exos in inflamed joints and significantly reduced the inflammatory response of the cartilage and synovial membrane. Moreover, the drug concentration of the engineered MSC-Exos was 10 times lower than that of pure MSC-Exos. These studies revealed that, compared with MSCs or MSC-Exos alone, engineered MSCs or MSC-Exos can better inhibit inflammation, increase drug concentration at the damaged site and have a better therapeutic effect. Although engineered MSCs and MSC-Exos have not been studied for the treatment of SS, this therapy is of great significance as a reference for SS.",
        "Somatic cells are differentiated, and mature cells have high specificity. In 2006, Takahashi and Yamanaka (Ref. 59) were the first to use viral vectors to transfer four transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc) to mouse embryos or adult fibroblasts to obtain iPSCs. They are similar to ESCs in expression morphology, growth characteristics and marker genes, and have similar potential for self-renewal and multidirectional differentiation. In addition, they avoid the ethical and immune rejection problems associated with stem cell transplantation. Current studies have confirmed that skin fibroblasts, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), amniotic fluid cells, epidermal keratinocytes, urine cells and other cells can be reprogrammed into iPSCs under specific conditions (Refs 60, 61, 62). iPSCs can be genetically manipulated with high efficiency and reliability. This indicates that an unlimited supply of iPSCs can be generated from a single blood, urine or tissue donor, resulting in large-scale generation of standardised derivatives (Ref. 63).",
        "Currently, MSCs and MSC-EVs derived from iPSCs are mostly used in SS studies. Hai et al. (Ref. 64) injected phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1 × 106 iPSC-MSCs or BM-MSCs into the caudal vein of NOD mice. The results showed that lymphocyte infiltration in the MSCs group decreased significantly; however, there was no significant difference between the iPSC-MSC and BM-MSC groups. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results showed that the serum levels of anti-La and anti-Ro50 significantly decreased. The B cell marker CD19; B/plasma cell markers CD79a, CD79b, and Ighg3; helper T cell marker CD4; Th17 marker IL17; Treg marker Fxop3; Tfh marker induced T cell co-stimulatory factor (Icos) and its ligand Icosl and activated APCs markers CD40 and IL-10 were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The MSC group showed significantly reduced expression of CD19, CD79a, CD79b and Ighg3 in the SMG, whereas the iPSC-MSC group showed more obvious inhibition. The expression of CD4, Fxop3, Icosl and CD40 was downregulated in both the iPSC-MSC and BM-MSC groups, whereas the expression of IL-10 was upregulated, with no difference between the two groups. There was no difference in Icos expression between the MSC and control groups, and IL-17 expression was not detected. In conclusion, iPSC-MSCs were comparable with BM-MSCs. This mechanism may involve exerting immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting T and B cell recruitment and the activation of Tfh and APCs.",
        "The SGECs of patients with SS express and present autoantigens and provide co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD40, CD80 and CD86, to activate T cells. Moreover, they induced initial CD4+ T cell to differentiation into Tfh cells using inducible co-stimulatory molecules (ICOSLG) and IL-6. In a study by Hai et al. (Ref. 64), PBMCs were co-cultured with SGECs, and the mRNA levels of Icos, IL-21, IL-12A and IL-17A were upregulated. The mRNA levels of CD40, CD80, CD86, ICOSLG and IFN-γ in SGECs were also upregulated. After EV treatment of BM-MSCs and iPSC-MSCs, the above factors were significantly inhibited, but IL-10 mRNA levels in PBMC increased. The mRNA levels of Foxp3 in PBMC and those of IL-6, IL-12A and IL-18 in SGECs were not affected, and ICOSLG mRNA expression was not detected. This suggests that Tregs may not mediate the upregulation of IL-10 by EV but may be caused by the inhibition of Tfh differentiation. However, Tfh differentiation in SGECs was influenced by ICOSLG. These data suggest that EVs from BM-MSCs and iPSC-MSCs can inhibit Tfh and Th17 differentiation induced by SGECs and immune cell interactions, as well as the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory factors. In vivo, NOD mice injected with iPSC-MSC-EVs via the tail vein showed significantly decreased lymphocyte infiltration of SMGs, serum anti-La/Ro antibody levels and B-cell-related gene expression. In addition, the inhibitory effect of iPSC-MSC-EVs on the expression of CD3e, CD4, Icos and Icosl and lymphocyte infiltration in the SMG was similar to that of iPSC-MSCs.",
        "Since SS can involve multiple systemic systems, such as the lungs, kidneys and also the cardiovascular system, researchers have been using iPSCs to induce various organoids in recent years, which is of great significance for the study of SS organ involvement. Organoids are not human organs in the true sense but three-dimensional (3D) multicellular structures that can approximate real organs in terms of structure and function. They can also simulate the structure and function of tissues in the body to a great extent and are stable for long-term subcultures. Moreover, compared with animal models, they can better reflect human physiology and disease conditions. Currently, 3D organoids induced by iPSCs include lung, kidney, liver and vascular organoids. Human pulmonary organoids (Ref. 65) were generated from hPSCs with bronchi/bronchiole cell types and structures similar to those of human airways. These cells are surrounded by lung mesenchymal cells and cells expressing alveolar cell markers. Various previous studies have shown that the induction of analogue signals (such as Wnt11, Wnt9b and FGF) in vitro helped generate iPSCs renal organoids (Ref. 66). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed developing podocytes, proximal tubules, distal tubules, collecting tubules and endothelial cells (Ref. 66). Mun et al. successfully established iPSCs liver organoids (Ref. 67). They exhibit self-renewal capabilities and functional activities in protein and lipid metabolism, drug metabolism, regeneration and inflammatory responses. Wimmer et al. (Ref. 68) prepared vascular organoids induced by iPSC-containing endothelial cells and pericytes that assembled into a network of capillaries wrapped in a basement membrane. When transplanted into mice, a vascular tree with stable perfusion is formed.",
        "Although animal models (most commonly mice) have made significant contributions to the understanding of disease mechanism, they have failed to translate during conversion from experimental animal models to human drug trials (Refs 69, 70). Therefore, iPSCs must be induced into organoids for disease modelling. iPSCs have a considerable impact on medical fields such as cell therapy, disease modelling, drug screening and regenerative medicine. Since iPSCs of different tissue origins retain epigenetic information about the donor tissue origin, they can easily differentiate into the cell types of the donor cell origin (Ref. 61). Therefore, before the actual application of iPSCs in clinical practice, many obstacles need to be solved, such as which tissue cells prepared by iPSCs are the most efficient and can be mass-produced. Only in this manner can the real potential of iPSCs be effectively translated into clinical practice to better serve patients.",
        "SGSCs can self-renew and differentiate into specific cell types (Ref. 71). Patients with SS or undergoing radiotherapy of the head and neck have symptoms of dry mouth, and their salivary gland function cannot recover. Although artificial saliva substitutes, salivary tubes and systemic parasympathetic pathological mimics can be used to treat these conditions, these are all palliative approaches. Mouse ESCs can be gradually induced to develop into early salivary glands and mature further after in situ transplantation, demonstrating the feasibility of using functional salivary glands instead of organs. However, this approach is limited by the tumourigenicity of mouse ESCs and the heterogeneity of animal-derived cells. Human adult stem cells have been used as alternatives to construct organoids with specific structures and functions.",
        "In one study by Sui et al. (Ref. 71) isolated human submaxillary gland stem/progenitor cells (hSMGepiS/PCs) for 3D culture to generate organoids that were further induced by FGF-10 in vitro. hSMGepiS/PC-derived spheres were transplanted into the renal capsule of nude mice alone or in combination with the salivary gland mesenchyma of mice on the 12th day of the embryo. hSMGepiS/PC-derived spheres reacted with the embryonic salivary gland mesenchyma of mice and developed into salivary glands with the correct structure and independent secretory function in vivo. This not only confirmed the regenerative potential of hSMGepiS/PCs but also showed that hSMGepiS/PCs responded to the mouse embryonic mesenchymal niche and further differentiated. Jeong et al. (Ref. 72) isolated and cultured tissue-specific stem cells, namely human salivary gland stem cells (hSGSCs), which express stem cell surface antigen markers such as CD44, CD49f, CD90 and CD105, but not HSC markers such as CD34 and CD45. Next, hSGSCs or PBS were injected intravenously into Wistar rats with radiation-induced damage. The body weight of the rats in the hSGSCs group increased significantly compared with that in the PBS group; the salivary flow rate increased two-fold, and the structure of salivary glands showed a compact acicular structure similar to that of the undamaged normal rats, suggesting that hSGSCs can improve the structure and function of rat salivary glands and may have the characteristics of stem cells, which can be used as a cell therapy agent for damaged salivary glands.",
        "Partial functional recovery of the parotid gland (PG) after a certain threshold of radiation therapy indicates the presence of stem or progenitor cells that proliferate and differentiate, allowing for tissue regeneration in response to injury. Serrano Martinez et al. (Ref. 73) isolated PG stem/progenitor cells from the PGs of female C57BL/6 mice and observed elevated expression of CK14 (basal transverse duct marker of the PG), AQP5 (acinar cell marker), CK8 (luminal PG duct marker) and amylase after 3D culture. This indicates that the ability to self-renew, differentiate and expand over a long period supports the stem cell or organoid characteristics. According to in vitro the 3D cultures of stem/progenitor cells, they possess stem cell characteristics. Thus, they can provide a new method for the treatment of SS, promote the development of organoids, provide a basis for subsequent organoid transplantation, disease modelling and drug screening, and lay the foundation for clinical transformation.",
        "In addition to the aforementioned stem cell therapy, research on immune cell therapy for autoimmune diseases continues to emerge. Immunocell therapy includes chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) and adoptive cell therapy. Currently, CAR-T cells are the most studied cells in the field of autoimmune diseases (Refs 74, 75). CAR-T therapy involves the in vitro activation of T cells collected from the peripheral blood of patients to induce the expression of chimeric antigen receptors and their expansion. The modified CAR-T is transfused back into the patient's body to specifically identify and bind the corresponding antigen such that CAR-T cells can activate, proliferate, and kill target cells and continue to restore immune balance. Currently, the strategy for studying autoimmune diseases focuses on CAR-CD8+T cell therapy, CAR-CD4+T cell therapy, and CAR-Treg cell therapy.",
        "At present, there are only a few related studies on SS and many reports on SLE. In studies by Kansal et al. (Ref. 76) and Jin et al. (Ref. 77) on CAR-T therapy for SLE, CAR-T cells targeting CD19+B cells were injected into MRL-lpr lupus mice, and the results showed that the survival time of the CAR-T group was prolonged, in the spleen, bone marrow, and blood were not detected CD19+B cells. Jin et al. (Ref. 77) found that skin symptoms and kidney involvement improved in MRL-lpr lupus mice injected with CAR-T cells before disease onset. Thus, CAR-T therapy can prevent or ameliorate disease, prolong the lifespan of mice, and continue to consume CD19+B cells. In a clinical study, a patient with severe and refractory SLE patient (Ref. 78) who was treated with hydroxychloroquine, high-dose glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, B-cell targeting drugs, and other treatments was not controlled. After CAR-T cell therapy, circulating B cells continued to be completely consumed; C3 and C4 levels increased or even normalised; and anti-dsDNA antibody levels, urinary protein levels, and SLE disease activity index scores decreased. In a clinical trial conducted by Mackensen et al. (Ref. 79), a total of five patients with SLE were recruited. After receiving CAR-CD4+T therapy targeting CD19+B cells, clinical symptoms improved, B cells in the peripheral blood disappeared, CAR-T cell proliferation, and B cell reconstruction were observed, and no traditional drug therapy was required during long-term follow-up. Based on these data, CAR-T therapy targeting CD19+B cells can sustain the deep clearance of B cells in patients with SLE, and the therapeutic effect persists even after B cell reconstruction without serious side effects. Thus, CAR-T cells are primarily used to treat SLE by targeting D19+B cells, resulting in the complete and sustained depletion of B cells that produce autoimmune antibodies. A study on CD19/BCMA CAR-Ts for the treatment of patients with refractory SS retrieved from the Clinical Trials website is still underway, and the results have not been published yet. Despite limited clinical data, the results of CAR-T cell therapy in SLE may become a new scheme for treating SS in the future.",
        "Treg cells (Refs 80, 81, 82, 83, 84) are a type of T cells, accounting for 5–10% of CD4+T cells. Treg cells play an important role in maintaining homoeostasis and regulating autoimmunity, as well as promoting tissue repair and regulating metabolism, which suppress the immune response through various mechanisms, including direct interaction with other immune cells or the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-β. At present, Treg cell therapy has not been studied in SS but has been reported in multiple sclerosis. Fransson et al. (Ref. 85) investigated the therapeutic effect of Treg cells on multiple sclerosis by creating antigen-specific Tregs targeting myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) with CAR and injecting them into experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models with MS. They found that MOG–CAR–Tregs inhibit the proliferation of effector T cells in vitro. Meanwhile, MOG–CAR–Treg reduced the disease symptoms in EAE mice and reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, INF-γ) in brain tissue in vivo.",
        "Although CAR-T cells have been poorly studied in SS, according to the findings in SLE and multiple sclerosis, they can be used as a novel treatment for SS. However, owing to limited clinical data, conducting long-term follow-ups in large clinical trials is imperative to clarify the safety and efficacy, as well as provide a basis for CAR-T therapy of SS and hope for more patients.",
        "For SS cell therapy, HSCs have strong proliferation and differentiation abilities in the primitive stage, and their self-renewal is rapid. MSCs exhibit high proliferation, multidirectional differentiation and immunomodulatory abilities. Small MSC-EVs can quickly pass through capillaries, have stable properties and do not decline over time. The homing ability of the engineered MSCs and MSC-Exos was strong, and their therapeutic effects were optimal. iPSCs have the same potential for self-renewal and multi-differentiation as ESCs while avoiding the ethical and immune rejection problems of ESCs. They can also induce the formation of organoids, such as lungs, kidneys, blood vessels and salivary glands, which have great potential in the construction of disease models, screening of drugs, the study of pathogenesis, treatment and regeneration, and have great potential application value. Preclinical data have demonstrated the safety of CAR-T-cell therapy. However, HSCs differ in terms of stem cell collection, pretreatment, and GVHD after transplantation. MSCs are limited in terms of tissue origin heterogeneity, cell preparation, number of target organs reached and survival time (Ref. 64). However, many problems still need to be solved before MSC-EVs can be used clinically. The culture conditions, mass production, rapid and accurate quantification, characterisation methods, pharmacokinetics and determination of the optimal clinical dose must be improved (Ref. 86). Engineered MSCs and MSC-Exos present difficulties in their preparation, composite side effects and transfection efficiency. iPSCs must solve the problems of donor cells or tissues, low reprogramming efficiency, carrier selection and transcription factor combinations. There are many obstacles to the preparation, mass production and translation of organoids. CAR-T cell therapy must address cell acquisition, gene introduction, amplification, mass production, preservation methods and quality detection (Ref. 87).",

        "Stem cells have raised tremendous expectations among the medical doctors, researchers, patients, and the general public due to their capacity to differentiate into a broad range of cell types. Stem cell researchers are engaged in different endeavors, including treating genetic disorders and generating new stem cell-derived human tissues and biomaterials for use in pharmacy genomics and regenerative medicine. Results obtained from completed and on-going clinical studies indicate huge therapeutic potential of stem cell-based therapy in the treatment of degenerative, autoimmune and genetic disorders 1, 2.",
        "However, clinical application of stem cells raises some ethical and safety concerns. In this review we provide an overview of the most important ethical issues in stem cell research and therapy, as a contribution to the debate about their clinical use in regenerative and transplantation medicine. We describe and discuss ethical challenges regarding human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research, therapeutic potential and clinical translation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and safety issues of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy.",
        "Our hope is that stem cell scientists and clinicians will use the information presented herein as a starting point for more in-depth analysis of ethical and safety issues related to clinical translation of stem cells since controversial regulation and application of stem cell therapy has been falsely celebrated not only in countries with lax medical regulations but also in many developed countries. For instance, in 2016, 351 US businesses engaged in frequently unproven and direct-to-consumer marketing of different stem cell interventions was offered at 570 clinics 3.",
        "hESCs are stem cells derived from the pluripotent inner cell mass of the pre-implantation embryos 4, 5. hESCs express typical pluripotent stem cell markers such as octamer-binding transcription factor 3/4 (OCT3/4), stage specific embryonic antigens 3 and 4 (SSEA-3 and SSEA-4), TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81 and alkaline phosphatase, possess high levels of telomerase activity and show normal karyotype 6, 7. hESCs have capacity to differentiate into cell types of all three germ layers [endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm] under in vitro and in vivo conditions 6, 7. Consequently, hESCs hold great promise in understanding of early human embryology and for developing the cell replacement strategies for the treatment of human diseases (Figure 1).",
        "Nevertheless, the ethical dilemma involving the destruction of a human embryo was and remains a major factor that has slowed down the development of hESC-based clinical therapies.",
        "The fundamental question is: Whether it is morally acceptable to pursue novel therapies for curing illnesses at the expense of destroying an early human embryo? This debate brings out individual opinions so deeply rooted in basic moral beliefs that developing a definitive policy acceptable to everyone seems unlikely. This ethical dilemma is portrayed in different legislation that exists throughout the world regulating hESCs research 8, 9. For example, in many countries including United Kingdom, it is illegal to perform nuclear transfer (NT) for reproductive or therapeutic purposes, while use of hESCs for research is allowed. Other countries retain more extreme stances, as is the case of Italy where there is a prohibition on all hESC-based research. On contrary, it is legal to use supernumerary in vitro fertilization (IVF)-derived embryos for derivation of new hESCs lines and to perform NT for the generation of patient-specific stem cells in the United Kingdom 10-12. United States banned production of any hESCs line that requires the destruction of an embryo and research using hESCs lines is limited on usage of lines created prior to August 9, 2001. Present restrictions have additionally slowed the progress of hESCs technology and provide a significant barrier to the development of cell based clinical therapies. Additionally, the ethical debate surrounding the harvest of hESCs has made research on this topic controversial, and as a result, the majority of studies were focused on animal models 13.",
        "It is important to highlight that beside ethical concerns, safety issues regarding hESC-based therapy are the main problem for their clinical use. The pluripotency of hESCs is a double-edged sword; the same plasticity that permits hESCs to generate hundreds of different cell types also makes them difficult to control after in vivo transplantation 14. When undifferentiated hESCs are transplanted, teratomas, tumors that contain all three germ layers, could develop [Figure 1] 15. Studies have revealed that appearance of teratoma is between 33-100% in hESC-transplanted immunodeficient mice, depending on the implantation site, cell maturation, purity, and implantation techniques 16, 17.",
        "Currently, the only way to ensure that teratoma will not develop after hESC transplantation is to differentiate them in desired and mature cell type before injection and screen them for the presence of undifferentiated cells. When such procedures were rigorously followed, teratomas were not observed in over 200 animals transplanted with hESC-derived cardiomyocytes 18. However, unwanted and uncontrolled differentiation of hESCs was still noticed despite following up of this procedure. Primitive population of nestin+ neuroepithelial cells, that continued to proliferate in the striatum, was noticed in rats with Parkinson disease, 70 days after transplantation of hESC-derived dopamine neurons 19. This raises a cautionary flag and suggests that even committed progenitors can proliferate excessively after transplantation, a problem that may be solved by improving purification methods.",
        "However, despite these safety concerns, recently published data 20 suggest that under controlled conditions, hESC-derived cells could serve as a potentially safe new source in regenerative medicine.",
        "Clinical trial that investigates potential of hESC-based therapy for the treatment of diabetes mellitus is opened and recruitment of patients has begun in 2014 21. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VC-01, an implant containing hESCs derived pancreatic progenitor cells encapsulated by an immune protecting device, which would allow the cells to proliferate and differentiate into mature β-cells in vivo without the possibility of immune rejection 22.",
        "Recently, Song and co-workers 20, reported that subretinal transplantation of hESC-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (hESC-RPE) in four Asian patients: two with dry age-related macular degeneration and two with Stargardt macular dystrophy was safe and well tolerated procedure. Visual acuity improved 9-19 letters in three patients and remained stable [+1 letter] in one patient. During one year follow-up period, serious safety issues related to the transplanted cells such as: adverse proliferation, tumorigenicity, ectopic tissue formation, was not observed. Based on these encouraging results, during the past few years, several clinical trials are investigating therapeutic potential of hESC-RPE in patients with Stargardt macular dystrophy and advanced dry age related macular degeneration (Table 1, left panel) and promising results are expecting in next year.",
        "iPSC are very similar to hESCs in terms of karyotype, phenotype, telomerase activity and capacity for differentiation. However, iPSCs are considered morally superior to hESCs since their generation does not require destruction of embryos 23. Takahashi and Yamanaka demonstrated the first direct reprogramming of mammalian somatic cells 24. Up-regulation of “Yamanaka factors”: sex determining region Y box-containing gene 2 [SOX2], OCT3/4, tumor suppressor Krüppel-like factor 4 [KLF4], and proto-oncogene c-MYC managed to reprogram differentiated somatic cells in the pluripotent state 24.",
        "Since then, iPSCs technology provides a historic opportunity to move away from embryo destruction and opened a new era of personalized medicine. Patient-specific iPSCs may be helpful in drug screening, generating in vitro models of human diseases, and novel reproductive techniques (Figure 2). In vitro, patient-specific iPSCs can differentiate to specific cell types which enable testing of new drugs in patient-specific conditions. Since iPSC-derived cells are generated from somatic cells previously obtained from a patient, there is no risk of immune rejection after their transplantation 25. The development of reproductive technology enables generation of gametes (sperm and eggs) from human iPSCs 26. This technique could be helpful for treating infertility, however, the use of iPSC-derived gametes raises set of ethical concerns related to the potential exploitation of created embryos, human NT, and risk of change natural reproduction including the possibility to derive gametes for same-sex reproduction, as well as in the asexual reproduction 26.",
        "As for hESCs the main safety issue regarding iPSC-based therapy is the risk of teratoma formation which can happened if patient receive iPSC-derived cells that contain undifferentiated iPSC (Figure 2). Uncontrolled proliferation and differentiation of transplanted undifferentiated iPSCs may result in generation of tumors and/or undesired differentiation of iPSCs in broad range of somatic cells 27. Thus, development of more effective methods for generation of purified populations of autologous iPSC-derived differentiated cells remains a challenge for personalized and regenerative medicine 28.",
        "It is important to highlight here that due to the genomic instability of iPSCs 29, even improved protocols for their differentiation, does not guarantee safe clinical application and underlines several differences compared to hESCs 30-32.",
        "Transformation of iPSCs into tumor cells could be a consequence of oncogenic properties of the reprogramming cocktail (use of c-MYC) 33, or insertional mutagenesis induced by the reprogramming with integrating retroviral or lentiviral vectors which disrupts endogenous genes 34. Recently, clinical trial that investigated potential of autologous iPSC-RPE for the treatment of advanced neovascular age-related macular degeneration has been stopped 35. Although transplantation of iPSC-RPE in the first enrolled patient was well tolerated after one year follow-up, study was stopped when it moved on to a possible second patient. Since iPSC, derived from second patient contained mutation, they did not pass a genomic validation step and the team led by Takahashi decided to at least temporarily suspend the trial. However, what remains unclear at this time and what should be explored is whether the mutation in the second patient's iPSC was pre-existing in the patient's fibroblasts or it occurred during the reprogramming process itself.",
        "In order to make the transition of iPSC-based therapy from lab to clinic, recently conducted research studies are focusing on identifying new molecular strategies that can increase cell reprogramming efficiency without causing genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in the iPSCs 36. Several types of non-integrating methods have been developed [use of non-integrating adenoviral vectors, repeated transfection of plasmids, Cre-loxP- mediated recombination,\nPiggyBac-transposition] 37-41.",
        "Unfortunately, there is still insufficient data to argue that these retroviral and lentiviral-free iPSC are safe for clinical application (Figure 2). Accordingly, further in vitro and in vivo, animal, studies are necessary to develop optimized growth and differentiation protocols and reliable safety assays to evaluate the potential of iPSCs and iPSC-derived differentiated cells for clinical application in patients.",
        "Several clinical trials that are going to explore clinical potential of iPSC-derived cells are currently recruiting patients (Table 1, right panel) and scientific and public community curiously expects these results.",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells are adult, fibroblast-like, multipotent cells, most frequently isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AT) and umbilical cord blood (UCB) 42. The International Society for Cellular Therapy formulated minimal criteria for uniform characterization of MSCs such as plastic adherence, potential for differentiation in osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineage, cell surface expression of CD105, CD73, CD90 and the absence of hematopoietic markers CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79α or CD19 and HLA-DR (Figure 3) 43.",
        "These cells can differentiate into a variety of cell types of mesodermal origin and due to their plasticity, some studies 44-46 claim that MSCs can differentiate towards cells of neuro-ectodermal (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) or endodermal (hepatocytes) origin 47. In addition to their differentiation potential, MSCs possess broad spectrum of immuno-modulatory capacities 48. MSCs 'primed' by pro-inflammatory cytokines (interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha) adopt immunosuppressive phenotype, and through cell-to-cell contact (engagement of the inhibitory molecule programmed death 1 with its ligands) or through the production of soluble factors (transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin (IL)-10, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), prostaglandin E2, nitric oxide, indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase and heme-oxygenase-1) modulate the adaptive and innate immune response 42, 49. In addition, MSCs lack the expression of membrane bound molecules involved in immune rejection which enable their allogenic transplantation 50.",
        "Accordingly, the past decade has witnessed an outstanding scientific production focused towards the possible clinical applications of MSCs in the therapy of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), liver disorders and cardiac diseases with very encouraging results (Figure 3) 51-70.",
        "Instantly, there are two routes for the administration of MSCs in IBDs patients: intravenous administration for the systemic control of intestinal inflammation in the therapy of luminal Chron's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and the local administration as a therapeutic approach for patients with perianal fistulazing CD 51-58. Administration of autologous or allogeneic MSCs derived from BM and AT achieved significant clinical efficacy in patients with fistulazing CD by attenuating local immune response and by promoting tissue repair 51-58.",
        "Results obtained in huge number of clinical trials 51-55 indicate that local application of autologous and allogeneic BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs are simple, safe, and beneficial therapy for the treatment of perianal fistulas in CD patients with no adverse effects. On contrary, adverse effects have been reported in three of nine improved clinical trials 56 that investigated therapeutic potential of intravenously injected MSCs.",
        "Study conducted by Duijvestein and coworkers 56 documented that 6 weeks after MSCs treatment, three patients required surgery due to disease worsening. Similar results were noticed in another clinical trial 57. In this study, autologous MSCs, derived from marrow aspirate and propagated for 2-3 weeks with fibrinogen depleted human platelet lysate, were administered to IBD patients. Twelve patients received single MSCs intravenous infusion of 2, 5 or 10 million cells/kg and serious adverse events were seen in seven patients. Aggravation of disease was noticed in five patients while adverse events in other two patients were possibly related to the infusion of MSCs 57.",
        "Moreover, serious side effects were seen in patients with moderate to severe UC that received Multistem (stem cells derived from adult BM and non-embryonic tissue sources) as potentially new therapeutic agent for the treatment of UC 58.",
        "Serious adverse events noticed in some of MSC-treated patients could be explained by the fact that MSCs either suppress or promote inflammation in dependence of inflammatory environment to which they are exposed to 59. When MSCs are transplanted in the tissue with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12, IL-6, IL-17 and IL-23), MSCs adopt an immuno-suppressive phenotype and modify maturation of DCs, promote conversion of macrophages in anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype and suppress proliferation and activation of T lymphocytes, NK and NKT cells. In the presence of low levels of inflammatory cytokines, MSCs adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype and produce inflammatory cytokines that promote neutrophil and T cell activation and enhance immune response and inflammation 59.",
        "Over the past few years, several clinical trials used MSCs to treat patients with liver diseases 60-65. Obtained results demonstrated that MSCs treatment improved liver function in safe and well tolerated manner 60-65. Amer and colleagues demonstrated the safety and short-term therapeutic effect of autologous transplantation of bone marrow MSCs-derived hepatocyte-like cells in patients with end-stage liver failure 61. In patients with liver failure caused by hepatitis B virus infection, autologous transplantation of BM-MSCs provided short-term efficacy in respect to several clinical and biochemical parameters, but long-term outcomes were not markedly improved 62. Recent studies reported that infusion of umbilical cord-derived MSCs was well tolerated in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and in patients suffering from acute on chronic liver failure, resulting in significant improvement of liver function and increased survival rates 64, 65.",
        "Several studies have examined therapeutic potential of autologous and allogeneic MSCs in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (MI) 66-70. In a phase I clinical study 66, 53 patients were randomized to receive either allogeneic MSCs or placebo, 7 to 10 days after MI. An improvement of overall clinical status was noticed 6 months after intravenous infusion of MSCs. Chen and colleagues 67 administered autologous MSCs intra-coronary in patients with subacute MI and observed decreased perfusion defect, improved left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular remodeling 3 months after therapy.",
        "Currently, there are several published or ongoing clinical trials that demonstrated beneficent effects of MSC-based therapy in the treatment of chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. Injection of MSCs attenuated fibrosis, induced neo-angiogenesis, enhanced contractility, and improved the quality of life of patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy 66-70. Additionally, it was reported that intracoronary transplantation of autologous MSCs reduced episodes of tachycardia in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy and implanted cardioverter defibrillator 69. Haack-Sørensen and co-workers performed demonstrated that intra-myocardial injections of autologous MSC significantly improve quality of life, physical limitation and angina stability of patients with chronic coronary artery disease and refractory angina 70.",
        "Despite these promising results, safety issues regarding MSCs-based therapy are still a matter of debate, especially in the long-term follow up. The primary concern is unwanted differentiation of the transplanted MSCs and their potential to suppress anti-tumor immune response and generate new blood vessels that may promote tumor growth and metastasis.",
        "MSCs have a potential to differentiate into undesired tissues, including bone and cartilage. Encapsulated structures were found in the infarcted areas of myocardium after transplantation of MSCs. The structures contained calcifications or ossifications 71. Study conducted by Yoon et colleagues showed that transplantation of unfractionated BM-derived cells into acutely infarcted myocardium may induce development of intra-myocardial calcification 72.",
        "It was recently reported that three women suffering from macular degeneration, within a week of undergoing “adipose tissue stem cell”-based therapy developed complications including vision loss, detached retinas and bleeding and are now totally blind and unlikely to recover 73. The treatment involved combining fat tissue removed from the patients' abdomens with enzymes to obtain “adipose-derived” stem cells. These were mixed with blood plasma containing large numbers of platelets and injected into the women's eyes. Although, usually experimental eye procedures are tested on one eye first so that if something goes wrong the patient is still able to see with the other eye, in this trial both eyes were treated at once which, at the end, resulted with complete blindness in these patients.",
        "These results suggest that local microenvironment in which MSCs engraft contains factors that induce unwanted differentiation of transplanted MSCs in vivo. Therefore, new research studies should be focused in definition of factors and signaling pathways that are responsible for the fate of MSCs after their in vivo administration.",
        "In addition to unwanted differentiation, MSCs may bridge the gap between anti-tumor immune response and neo-angiogenesis in malignant diseases, thus promoting tumor growth and metastasis. After injection, MSCs migrate towards primary tumors 74 where due to their immuno-modulatory characteristics; suppress anti-tumor immune response resulting with an increased tumor growth 75, 76. We showed that injection of human MSCs promotes tumor growth and metastasis in tumor bearing mice, which was accompanied by lower cytotoxic activity of NK and CD8+ T cells and increased presence of immuno-suppressive IL-10 producing T lymphocytes and CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells 77. MSCs promote polarization of immune response towards anti-inflammatory Th2 pathway creating an immunosuppressive environment which enables progression of tumor growth and metastasis 77.",
        "Additionally, MSCs promote metastasis by enhancing generation of new blood vessels. MSCs have the capacity to differentiate into endothelial cells and to create a capillary network 78, 79. Injected MSCs migrate to the metastatic sites 74 and produce pro-angiogenic factors: vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, TGF-β, platelet-derived growth factor, angiopoietin-1, placental growth factor, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, HGF, resulting with neo-vascularization 80.",
        "The creation and clinical use of hESCs have long been the unique focus of stem cell ethics. Current ethical controversies regarding stem cell-based therapy are focused on the unlimited differentiation potential of iPSCs which can be used in human cloning, as a risk for generation of human embryos and human-animal chimeras.",
        "Since undesired differentiation and malignant transformation are major safety issues regarding transplantation of iPSCs and iPSC-derived cells, protocols for differentiation of iPSCs should be optimized in order to ensure the purity of iPSC-derived populations of differentiated cells before their clinical use. Considering the fact that MSCs are frequently and worldwide offered as universal human remedy but may promote tumor growth and metastasis, studies which utilize MSCs should be focused in continuous monitoring and long-term follow-up of MSC-treated animal models in order to determine possible pro-tumorigenic and other detrimental effects of MSC-based therapy.",

        "Potential applications of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSC technology can be potentially utilized in disease modeling, drug discovery, gene therapy, and cell replacement therapy. Genetic mutations can be corrected by gene targeting approaches before or after reprogramming. iPSCs are considered morally superior then ESCs since their generation do not require destruction of embryos. Introduction of the four transcription factors-“Yamanaka factors“ (Oct-4, Sox-2, Klf-4, and c-Myc) leads to reprogramming of a somatic cell to an iPSC which can further differentiate into different types of cells. Two types of methods for the delivery of reprogramming factors into the somatic cells can be used: integrating viral vector systems and non-integrating methods.

MSCs have been applied clinically in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), liver disorders and cardiac diseases with very encouraging results. MSCs possess broad spectrum of immuno-modulatory capacities. Serious adverse events noticed in some of MSC-treated patients could be explained by the fact that MSCs either suppress or promote inflammation in dependence of inflammatory environment to which they are exposed to.

        "One of the main distinguishing features of early mammalian development is the occurrence of a population of developmentally plastic, pluripotent stem cells that give rise to all cells that constitute the mature organism. These specialized cells can be cultured in vitro and are referred to as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [1,2]. ESCs have undergone a great revolution in developmental biology through the generation of genetically engineered mice [3,4,5,6]. Since these in vitro grown ESCs exhibit the potential to generate all lineages of the embryo in vivo and can give rise to any type of somatic cells such as cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, neuronal cells and hepatocytes upon in vitro differentiation, human ESCs gained popularity as a valuable cellular source for the treatment of many degenerative diseases such as ischemic heart failure, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, spinal cord injuries and age-related macular degeneration [5,7]. Starting with an attempt to treat spinal cord injuries in 2010, there have been more than a dozen clinical trials with human ESCs to treat severe ischemic left ventricular dysfunction, age-related macular degeneration, Parkinson’s disease and diabetes, among other degenerative conditions [7,8,9]. However, the human ESC-based clinical trials suffer immensely from the ethical concerns regarding the use of cells of embryonic origin and from failed in vitro fertilized embryos that could result in abnormal development, and from the concerns of immune rejection after transplantation due to the allogenic origin of ESCs [10,11]. The breakthrough discovery in 2016 by Takahashi and Yamanaka enabled the reprogramming of terminally differentiated, lineage restricted adult somatic cells such as skin biopsy derived fibroblasts and peripheral blood derived T lymphocytes directly to a pluripotent state through the forced ectopic expression of the transcriptional factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF, c-MYC, NANOG and LIN28 (Figure 1) [12,13,14,15,16]. These cells, termed as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), exhibit similar gene expression, epigenetic profile and the differentiation potential to give rise to any type of somatic cells as that of ESCs.",
        "The past 12 years following the groundbreaking discovery of iPSCs have witnessed an explosion of knowledge and enormous progress in the arena of development biology, pathophysiology and etiology for a number of diseases and disorders at the cellular level, as well as tremendous hope in the fields of cell-based regenerative medicine, high throughput drug discovery and toxicology platforms [12,17,18]. These iPSCs have been touted as a novel autologous cell source for cell replacement therapy for a number of degenerative diseases such as ischemic heart failure, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes mellitus and age-related macular degeneration due to the fact that the iPSCs can be generated from any individual and that millions or even billions of clinically relevant phenotypic cells such as cardiac or neuronal cells can be derived from iPSCs without the ethical and immune rejection concerns surrounding human ESCs. Clinical trials using human iPSC-derived cellular therapeutic products have been initiated and are currently being evaluated for their efficacy and safety [9,19]. New pharmacological candidates stemming from iPSC-based high throughput screens are in the pipeline [17]. Although the iPSC field has significantly advanced, it still suffers many challenges that need to be critically addressed to transform hope into reality regarding the efficient clinical utility of these cells in regenerative medicine. This review focuses on the current challenges that pose stumbling blocks in the clinical utility of iPSC-based cell products and their applications in biomedical research, drug discovery and predictive safety pharmacology.",
        "The major critical component in delineating the etiology and pathophysiology of any human disease and drug discovery is the requirement of a physiologically relevant experimental model of disease, either in vitro or in vivo or both, that faithfully recapitulates the respective pathophysiology and clinical manifestations. To this end, animal modelling, most frequently with mice, has been the key player in both basic research and pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) as a non-clinical efficacy model [18]. More often, the translation of drug trials to humans from experimental animal models fails due to species differences in biological responses, leading to high failure rates as reflected by the number of new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use every year. Therefore, it is more appealing to use an appropriate human model of diseases in vitro that recapitulates the pathophysiological mechanisms. Human primary cell-based disease modelling would be helpful but will be limited due to insufficient expandable cellular sources from patients, in particular hard to access cells such as cardiomyocytes, neuronal cells, pancreatic beta cells and other clinically relevant cells from organs other than skin and peripheral blood.",
        "The so called “personalized medicine” approach in which each individual patient would receive a tailored treatment is becoming critically important in medicine, pharmacology and toxicology to overcome possible adverse side effects and to minimize the frequency of non-responders. For example, the total number of people required to take a drug in order for only one of them to benefit from its effects ranges from 5–50 for some of the highest-grossing drugs, implying the high frequency of non-responders for certain drugs [20,21]. Even more alarmingly, millions of people are hospitalized annually due to adverse side effects due to their medications, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths per year and highlighting the critical need for precision medicine to eliminate the adverse mortality and morbidity due to side effects of drugs [20,22]. To this end, human iPSC-based disease models (Figure 2) are a promising candidate due to their unlimited supply of clinically relevant phenotypic cells, their human origin, their derivation potential from any individual, easy accessibility and scalability and the considerable advances in understanding the etiology and progression of a diverse array of diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and inherited cardiac diseases. A side-by-side comparison of human iPSC based in vitro and rodent in vivo experimental models will synergistically accelerate elucidating the pathophysiology mechanisms of diseases in basic research, novel drug discovery and safety pharmacology in a unprecedentent manner.",
        "Interestingly, iPSCs share a number of characteristics with cancer cells including indefinite proliferation capacity and the expression of oncogenic markers like c-MYC and metabolic signatures [23]. The generation of iPSCs from human cancer cells represents an opportunity to develop in vitro models of carcinogenesis for specific cancer types such as glioblastoma and gastrointestinal cancer, since the lack of a relevant model to study cancer progression has limited research which is suitable for translation to clinical settings [24,25,26,27]. Interestingly, iPSC disease models of several cancer-prone diseases such as Li–Fraumeni syndrome, Noonan syndrome, myelodysplastic syndromes, and familial adenomatous polyposis appear to be more attractive candidates in the study of cancer initiation and progression [28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. Also, iPSCs from somatic cells could be used to study carcinogenesis via overexpression or silencing of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and tracking the cellular changes and behaviors during cancer initiation and progression [38].",
        "Organs-on-chips are microfluidic cell culture systems seeded with patient specific iPSC-derived phenotypic cells that serve as functional units of human organs with a controlled, dynamic condition that recapitulates the complex tissue architecture and the physio-chemical microenvironment of tissues in the human body. These systems exhibit tissue- and organ-level functions that are not recapitulated in other 2D/3D in vitro cell models [20]. This organ-on-chip technology is being employed to develop more physiologically relevant, cost-effective in vitro models for hit-to-lead and lead optimization that can more reliably predict the efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of drugs in humans [39]. These chips are increasingly used as physiologically relevant pre-clinical disease models for a wide range of different diseases such as Barth syndrome-associated cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, drug-induced kidney glomerular injury, blood–brain barrier function and wound healing in drug discovery and safety pharmacology platforms [20,39,40,41]. Interestingly, the patient specific organs-on-chips made up of iPSCs derived from Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome patients revealed exacerbated inflammation as well as reduced vasoactive function [42,43].",
        "iPSC-based regenerative therapy has been widely touted as a novel means of improving the function of degenerated organs due to ageing such as age-related macular degeneration, genetic predisposition, injury and chemotherapies. The first clinical trial to treat age-related macular generation (AMD) with autologous iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells was launched in 2014 in Japan. The AMD trial with iPSCs will be launched in the US and is expected to commence this year at NIH’s National Eye Institute (NEI). Recently, Fate Therapeutics has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an iPSC trial with an off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell cancer immunotherapy in the US to treat solid tumors. A trial recently announced to commence in Japan aims at implanting cell sheets made of allogeneic human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes on the epicardium of patients with heart disease [9]. These ongoing clinical trials raise tremendous hopes that the iPSC technology will bear fruit in the years to come after its Nobel Prize-winning discovery. It is noteworthy to mention that there are differences in the regulatory approval process regarding iPSC-based cell therapies across different countries. Japan has recently adopted a fast-track approval system in 2014 that allows prospective iPSC-based regenerative treatments to be commercialized as long as the treatments have been proven to be safe and the future retrospective data from the treated patients are hoped to be convincing enough for their clinical efficacy. Although Japan’s fast-track approval system on iPSC-based therapies is critically debated, more countries are expected to follow this fast-track approval path for iPSC-based regenerative cell therapies [44,45].",
        "Since any clinically relevant phenotypic cells such as cardiomyocytes, neuronal cells, hepatocytes, insulin secreting pancreatic beta cells and renal progenitor cells can be derived from patient-specific iPSCs in unlimited quantities for high throughput assays and iPSCs can be derived from any individual patient and healthy subjects, iPSCs have gained a lot of popularity as more reliable in vitro human models of diseases for accelerated drug discovery and personalized precision medicines. Large scale “-omics” analysis of diseased versus normal phenotypic cells reveal the disease-perturbed and drug-affected regulatory networks in comparison to normal ones, thereby serving as a powerful tool for drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry [17,18,46,47,48].",
        "A major bottleneck in the drug development pipeline is the predictive safety pharmacology in which the drug is evaluated for its toxicity and potency. Immortalized cell lines of cancerous origin are the most commonly used for toxicological testing. The inherent deficiencies of chromosomal and genetic aberrations due to countless passages and prolonged culture in vitro make them non-representative of how a normal cell behaves physiologically in vivo. The primary cultures of somatic cells used for toxicological screenings are heterogenous due to large batch to batch variability and hence it is very challenging to produce consistent and reproducible readouts from the toxicological screening. On the other hand, live animal models raise concerns as to the suitability for human physiology investigations for certain conditions, ethical considerations for testing certain drugs and ingredients of cosmetic products, high cost associated with animal experimentation compared to in vitro cultured cells and technical difficulty to automate the in vivo platform. Although iPSCs can also accumulate chromosomal and genetic aberrations over prolonged periods of culture similarly to immortalized cell lines, the possibility to derive iPSCs from non-cancerous tissue origin and healthy controls and the availability of more physiologically relevant phenotypic cells in millions or even in billions for high throughput drug screening makes iPSC-based disease modeling more attractive. A large cohort of iPSC-based disease models with well characterized phenotypes and diverse ethnic origins can be used for high throughput, automatable toxicological screening and potency testing platforms in a cost-effective manner to obtain more physiologically reliable readouts [18,47,49,50,51,52,53,54,55].",
        "The first step in generating iPSCs is the selection of the donor cell type for the reprogramming process. iPSCs have been commonly generated from dermal fibroblasts from punch-skin biopsies, T cells from peripheral blood, renal tubular cells collected from urine samples and keratinocytes isolated from plucked hair [15,16,56,57,58,59,60,61]. Several studies have reported that iPSCs retain some degree of residual epigenetic memory from the somatic cell source from which they are derived and this can lead to their biased differential potential into certain cell types depending on the donor cell source due to the incomplete resetting of the non-CpG methylation patterns during reprogramming [62,63,64,65,66]. However, it has been shown that their residual epigenetic memory diminishes as the cells are passaged in culture over a period of time [67,68]. An important concern on the choice of donor cell type is that some types of donor cells such as skin biopsy-derived dermal fibroblasts and blood cells might carry more mutational burdens and chromosomal abnormalities due to exposure to ultraviolet radiation and high cell turnover rates, especially from older donors [69,70]. The second step in the iPSC generation process is the selection of the optimal method for cellular delivery of the reprogramming factors and the optimal combination of reprogramming factors for the iPSC derivation. The earlier methods of reprogramming made use of the retroviral and lentiviral delivery methods to deliver the reprogramming factors. This raised concerns that these delivery methods would cause insertional inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and/or insertional activation of oncogenes and that the constitutive expression of the reprogramming factors would alter the iPSC characteristics and their differentiation potentials. This necessitated the use of transient, integration-free methods of delivering the reprogramming factors such as viral delivery/transient transfection methods with the use of either Sendai virus, adenovirus, episomal plasmids, minicircle plasmids, mini-intronic plasmids, PiggyBac transposons, synthetic modified mRNAs, or miRNAs [71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78]. Among these, Sendai virus, episomal DNAs and synthetic mRNAs are the commonly used approaches in basic and clinical research to derive integration-free iPSCs due to their relatively high efficiency and relative simplicity. The episomal plasmids and Sendai virus methods have been the preferred methods of choice for deriving clinical grade iPSCs (Figure 1) [70].",
        "Given the huge variability across iPSC lines and their differentiated derivatives in terms of their differentiation potential, epigenetic status, tumorigenic potential, immunogenic potential, maturation characteristics, batch variability and co-occurrence of heterogenous populations of lineage subtypes and/or non-relevant cells as contaminating cell populations, the successful clinical outcome of the cell replacement therapy, in terms of efficacy and safety with these cells, largely and very critically rely on the acceptable quality criteria (Table 1) for these cells prior to the transplantation procedure in the patients. Failure to detect oncogenic mutations in these iPSCs and their derived cellular products is not a guarantor of the non-tumorigenicity aspect of the iPSC-based therapies. Even if known a priori, it may be possible that oncogenic aberrations could evade detection by the current high throughput sequencing methodologies due to sequencing errors and other technical limitations [79]. An important consideration is that the acceptable quality attributes of iPSCs and their differentiated derivatives used for clinical applications should be well defined for the safety and efficacy and this aspect is currently very poorly defined. Directed differentiation protocols and phenotypic selection based on cell surface antigens by magnetic- or flow cytometry-based sorting to yield a pure population of clinically relevant cells and strategies to improve the maturation characteristics and to gauge the magnitude of the maturation status of the cells are critically needed to improve the quality attributes of these cells for more effective cell-based regenerative therapy. A recent novel methodology making use of synthetic microRNA switches to purify the cell populations will help to improve the purity of the cell populations even if the cell surface markers are not available to tag the relevant cells [80]. The development of a consistent and reliable translational model and iPSC-derived clinical cellular products with well-defined cellular characteristics is therefore a vital pre-requisite for high throughput therapeutic applications and cell replacement therapy. Table 1 lists the minimal quality attributes required for clinical grade iPSCs and their differentiated drug products [81,82].",
        "One of the major stumbling blocks in iPSC-based cell replacement therapy is the risk of potential tumorigenicity from undifferentiated iPSCs in the cell population that will be used for cellular transplantation. The key concept is that iPSCs will almost certainly never be used in regenerative medicine if they are not able to cause a teratoma in mice [18,83,84]. iPSCs can form both teratomas and malignant tumors such as neuroblastoma and follicular carcinoma if transplanted in their undifferentiated pluripotent state in vivo [84]. Thus, the potential tumorigenicity risk to human patients from both teratomas and malignant tumors is quite possible if transplanted cells are contaminated with undifferentiated iPSCs. Although improved directed differentiation protocols, purification methods such as flow cytometry-/magnetic bead-based sorting and small chemical molecules that selectively cause cell death of undifferentiated iPSCs can eliminate the potential risk of tumorigenicity from potentially harmful undifferentiated iPSCs, it remains currently unknown whether these methods and tumorigenicity assays prior to transplantation are efficient and adequate enough to eliminate the risk of teratomas and malignant tumors upon transplantation in human subjects. Longer follow-up periods and very sensitive assays with the latest “-omics” approaches tailored to each and every individual patient’s genetic makeup are critically required on this end, along with analysis of cell survival, integration, durability, immune tolerance, cellular behavior, altered metabolism, functional improvements, undesired effects such as the risk of arrhythmogenicity in the case of myocardial infarction models and genetic stability in the target organs or respective tissues in the respective pre-clinical transplantation models [85].",
        "Earlier studies in mice reported that undifferentiated iPSCs were rejected in syngeneic recipients whereas recent studies report that the differentiated cells from iPSCs do not elicit immune rejection in syngeneic settings, implying that the differentiated cells may be less immunogenic compared to undifferentiated iPSCs [86,87,88,89]. However, this could differ between cell types. For example, in humanized mice, the iPSC-derived smooth muscle cells mounted immune rejection while retinal epithelial cells did not [86,87,88,89]. Of note are the recently published results on the first clinical trial with autologous iPSC-derived retinal epithelial cells in a patient with age-related macular degeneration who showed long-term survival of transplanted cells for 25 months without immune suppression [19]. In the event that the allogenic cell therapy requires immunosuppression, there is a growing concern regarding the use of persistent immunosuppression that increases the risk of kidney failure, severe infections and tumors. The risk versus benefit ratio is highly debatable in this case. A universal immune tolerant iPSC line will be ideal to this end. Strategies to enable the allogenic iPSCs to evade both T cell- and natural killer cell-mediated immune responses have been reported [90,91]. A recently reported novel approach in which inactivation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II genes and overexpression of CD47 in iPSCs enabled them to evade immune rejection in fully MHC mismatched allogeneic recipients and the transplanted cells survived long term without the use of immunosuppression [92]. These immune escape approaches have the potential to open the door to allogeneic iPSC-derived cell products without immune rejection concerns and complications.",
        "Despite the potential benefits of autologous iPSC therapies, there are also some limitations and challenges that need to be overcome. First, production of the clinical grade autologous iPSC -derived phenotypic cells requires a high production cost associated with individual patient-specific iPSC derivation by reprogramming along with clinical grade phenotypic cells derivation by differentiation with a stringent quality-controlled system. Second, the production of clinical grade human iPSC-derived clinically relevant phenotypic cells in a quality controlled and robust system, for example cardiomyocytes, can take approximately four months from start to finish. This can be critical since cardiac cell transplantation in chronic myocardial infarction will be less efficient than in subacute conditions [85]. More often, it may not be possible to meet the deadline for effective treatments of some disease conditions such as spinal cord injuries [6]. Therefore, the practical approach to take forward with iPSC-based cell therapy as most expert reviews conclude is the use of allogeneic iPSC-derived cell sources as opposed to autologous iPSCs with the major arguments that: (1) biobanking of a limited number of approved iPSC lines from various human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-homozygous donors that would match the majority of the population will be more efficient to provide large quantities of transplantable cells as an off-the-shelf-product from a quality controlled and rigorously tested production process; (2) regulatory clearance would be easier since any single line of such an iPSC bank could be thoroughly tested to be free of viral contamination, tumorigenicity and genome instability; and (3) the patient could more effectively benefit from the off-the-shelf product more readily in critical subacute conditions such as myocardial infarction and spinal cord injury. According to a recent estimate, it is likely to cost approximately $800,000 to produce a clinical grade autologous iPSC-derived cellular product in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements alone and approximately $10,000 to $20,000 for iPSC line generation for transplantation [93,94]. The allogenic approach can bring down the cost for iPSC-based cell therapy compared to the autologous approach and will also obviate the need for approval of individual patient-derived products by regulatory authorities [85]. On the other hand, if the transplanted cells elicit an immune response, the patients will have to be under life-long immunosuppression. Discontinuation of the immunosuppression in these patients will lead to rejection and clearance of the transplanted cells from their organs. Strategies to enable allogenic iPSC-derived therapeutic cells to evade T cell- and natural killer cell-mediated immune responses simultaneously as mentioned in the previous section would favor the use of allogenic iPSC-based cell therapy [90,91].",
        "One of the critical issues with iPSC-based disease modelling is the respective appropriate control. Earlier, control iPSCs were derived from family-matched, gender-matched healthy control subjects and these iPSCs exhibited a large heterogeneity and confounded the interpretation of the data due to cell line and genetic differences. The isogenic iPSC lines created by gene editing approaches from well characterized pre-existing iPSC lines from healthy control subjects can largely circumvent these cell line variation associated problems. Zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENS), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated (Cas) systems-9 based gene or base editing (whereby cytidine deaminase converts cytidine to uridine without the need for double strand break of DNA) enhance genetic editing efficiently in human ESCs and iPSCs [95]. This isogenic iPSC approach bridges the gap in the derivation of disease model from rare diseases with the disease-associated mutation because of its relative ease of use and high efficiency compared to other conventional tools. However, the major challenge with these gene editing methodologies is possible off-target effects. Off-target effects could be investigated with NextGen sequencing methodologies. Although it has been documented that each ESC line has its own clonal differences, iPSC lines show greater diversity than ESCs due to the residual epigenetic memory, genetic background and the characteristics acquired during reprogramming and differentiation [62,63,96]. Also, some iPSC lines exhibit characteristics of incomplete programming and reduced proliferation and differentiation potentials along with aberrant transcription and DNA methylation [97]. Evidence based criteria need to be formulated to select the completely reprogramed “bonafide” iPSC lines.",
        "The iPSC-based disease models generated for monogenic diseases with early onset of phenotypic variations such as long QT syndrome and spinal muscular atrophy have proved to be more efficient whereas the iPSC models created for monogenic diseases with late-onset of phenotypic changes (Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome), polygenic complex diseases involving association of more than one precipitating genetic mutations and interplay of various combinations of precipitating factors (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders), sporadic diseases for which the genetic causes have not been identified from the family history (sporadic cases of Alzheimer’s disease) and diseases that involve the interaction of more than one phenotypic cells (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) have been more challenging. Most of these disease models failed to recapitulate the disease phenotype due to iPSC’s inherent immaturity problems (i.e., Brugada syndrome) and lack of their respective native environmental cues. On the other hand, the iPSC-based disease modeling for diseases with clear early-onset phenotypic characteristics but with unknown or undefined genetic causes proved to be very powerful in decoding the disease etiology. The approaches aimed at enhancing the maturation of iPSC phenotypes (i.e., 3D iPSC organoid models and the inclusion of a large cohort of patient-specific iPSC lines coupled with the latest gene editing methodologies and NextGen sequencing platforms) will enable us to overcome these challenges associated with the polygenic, sporadic and late-onset disease models.",
        "So far, the vast majority of iPSC-based disease modelling studies performed the comparative evaluation of one or a few patient-derived iPSC lines with their respective family-matched and gender-matched controls (or recently their respective isogenic cell lines created with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing or base editing from healthy controls) and concluded the phenotypic differences observed from these cell lines to be the attributes of the respective disease mutations under study. However, such conclusions are often potentially confounded by other factors such as the genetic background and epigenetic status and the clonal variations of the iPSC lines that can dilute the observed differences during translation to the clinic in the case of complex, polygenic diseases where only disease-associated variants are known and the true causative variants are unknown. In such cases, the small number of patient-derived iPSCs will have limited potential due to large confounder effects and hence a large cohort of disease-relevant iPSC cell lines has to be used to minimize the signal-to-noise ratio. This could be challenging depending on the prevalence of the disease and the availability of patient donor cells, especially for rare diseases where the cost of iPSC derivation and the volume of lab resources required is high. To this end, the growing number of biobanks and iPSC repositories from which many iPSC lines for a particular disease are available will provide the feasibility to perform large scale studies to overcome the signal-to-noise ratio in the phenotypic differences, especially for complex polygenic diseases [70].",
        "One of the critical problems encountered in using patient-specific iPSC derived from clinically relevant phenotypic cells as in vitro disease models for either high throughput drug discovery, safety pharmacology or cell replacement therapy is the fact that the majority of these iPSC-derived phenotypic cells exhibit immature functional characteristics akin to their respective embryonic or fetal phenotypic cells and also contain a heterogenous mixture of varying proportions of phenotypic subtypes at the end of the differentiation protocols. For example, atrial, ventricular and nodal subtypes all occur in the same cell preparation and thereby often complicate the interpretation of experimental results. Therefore, the development of a consistent and reliable disease model with defined cellular characteristics and a homogenous population of the phenotypic cells of interest is a vital pre-requisite for high throughput therapeutic applications [98]. iPSC-based disease modelling has been widely used for early-onset diseases and proved to be successful models for early onset diseases such as long QT syndrome and spinal muscular atrophy [99,100]. However, for late-onset diseases, the disease models failed since the iPSC-derived relevant phenotypic cells lacked the adult maturation characteristics to exhibit the disease phenotype, since these cells exhibit embryonic- or fetal-like characteristics. There have been several approaches to induce the maturation of these primitive iPSC phenotypic cells such as treating the cells with mitochondrial stress inducers and inhibitors of protein degradation such as MG-132 and pyraclostrobin and ectopic overexpression of progerin, a truncated and toxic form of the lamin A protein that causes premature ageing (a condition called Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome), 3D co-culture to enhance paracrine-mediated stimulation of ageing and maturation, improved formulation of cultured/conditioned medium and derivation of iPSCs from adult aged patients [101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108]. Although these approaches induced ageing of the iPSC-derived phenotypic cells to a certain extent, the maturation of these cells was only modest, since the ageing and maturation apparently seem to follow their own distinct trajectories [109,110]. An alternative approach would be the direct conversion of somatic cells such as fibroblasts into clinically relevant phenotypic cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes to preserve the cellular ageing markers and possibly maturation state [111,112].",
        "iPSCs can accumulate chromosomal abnormalities, genetic instability, copy number variants and loss of heterozygosity over a period of time in in vitro culture and expansion since these cells are maintained in culture for prolonged periods of time. Of particular note is that the second patient in the first clinical trial with autologous iPSCs for AMD was not treated due to the concerns regarding the genetic alterations that occurred in the patient-derived iPSCs and the iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells, implying the possible occurrence of genetic instability and aberration in the clinical grade iPSCs and their phenotypic cells [19]. It is noteworthy to highlight that exome sequencing of 140 independent human ESC lines revealed more frequent, cancer-relevant TP53 mutations and the TP53 mutant allelic fraction increased with passage number [113]. Also, an important observation is that the mesenchymal stem cells exhibit mutational burst during prolonged culture periods [114]. Therefore, adequate safety measures such as engineering the therapeutic cells with one of the suicide gene therapy approaches—either the cytosine deaminase/5-flurocytosine or the herpes simplex virus/ganciclovir—need to be devised to eliminate the chromosomally abnormal cells and cells with potential risky genetic alterations, if any, upon transplantation [18,115].",
        "iPSCs have revolutionized personalized regenerative medicine and developmental biology within a short span of time and presented an unprecedented opportunity in deciphering the etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of multitudes of diseases and advanced our knowledge enormously on human physiology at the cellular level. Clinical trials with iPSC-derived phenotypic cells to treat several severely debilitating degenerative diseases and organ injuries are on the way to turn hope into reality and this is just the beginning of a powerful regenerative platform with more encouraging results and optimism so far. However, iPSC-based therapeutic approaches are still in their infancy and several obstacles need to be overcome for effective translation of the true potential of iPSCs into clinical settings with uncompromised patient safety. Technological advances such as next generation sequencing and “-omics” methodologies, gene/base editing, organs-on-chips, microRNA switches, biobanking efforts to enable large cohort iPSC-based studies, automated high throughput drug discovery and toxicological platforms and the incorporation of artificial intelligence [116] in deciphering the trajectories of differentiation pathways, complex gene-regulatory networks and cellular behaviors will greatly propel iPSC-based therapeutic applications in the future.",

        "Our understanding of injectables has changed a lot from the 1990s to today. In the past we were looking for the near‐ideal filler and discovering the advantages of temporary fillers. Nowadays we are looking for injectables that emulate the physiology of regeneration and we are discovering the effects of injectables on skin regeneration [1]. Biomaterial‐based injectables for anti‐aging and rejuvenation purposes have long been used in regenerative and aesthetic medicine. The injection induces a phlogistic response that causes a series of processes, ranging from tissue regeneration to fibrosis [2, 3]. These are aesthetic regenerative scaffolds: injected biomaterials that can predetermine the inflammatory response, inhibiting chronic inflammatory response, reverting fibrosis, and enhancing physiological tissue regeneration. They include calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHA), hyaluronic acid (HA), and poly‐L‐lactic acid (PLLA) dermal fillers [4].",
        "We present the case of a 56‐year‐old woman with Fitzpatrick skin phototype III, who complained of prominent wrinkles, dull facial appearance, and uneven skin texture. She denied smoking habit, reported spending a lot of time outdoors for work purposes and never applying sunscreen. On clinical observation, the patient displayed all the features of hypertrophic photo‐aging (HP) (Figure 1A). HP is characterized by deep wrinkles and a leathery appearance of the skin, primarily affecting skin phototypes III–IV. HP presents clinically with responses such as permanent tan, deep wrinkles, coarseness, leathery skin, that correspond to histological feature as reduced epidermal thickness, reduced CD44 expression, elastosis, reduced amount of elastic fibers, loss of fibrillin‐rich microfibrils (FRMs) at the dermo‐epidermal junction (DEJ), aberrant arrangement of collagen in dermis, reduced intensity of collagen VII [5, 6].",

The patient was injected with cannula 22G 70 mm, 1 syringe per each side, at T0, and a follow‐up visit was scheduled after 4 weeks (T4w).

The optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis conducted on the left and tight cheeks at T0 and T1 revealed an improvement in collagen disposition. Collagen density increased after 4 weeks (Table 1; Figure 2C–F). This experience aims to share our decision‐making paths in the field of injectables. The choice of injectables in the field of facial rejuvenation has to be based on the needs of the patient's skin. In this case, our patient needed the rearrangement of fibrillar collagen fibers of papillary dermis in linear and ordered pattern, the reconstitution of the structure of the skin, and the regeneration of the DEJ. We chose a HA + CaHA‐based injectable to induce fibroblast differentiation, stimulate neocollagenogenesis, and restore plumpness, as supported by clinical results and non‐invasive skin imaging.

Despite many reports describing functional cell differentiation, no studies have succeeded in generating a three-dimensional vascularized organ such as liver. Here we show the generation of vascularized and functional human liver from human iPSCs by transplantation of liver buds created in vitro (iPSC-LBs). Specified hepatic cells (immature endodermal cells destined to track the hepatic cell fate) self-organized into three-dimensional iPSC-LBs by recapitulating organogenetic interactions between endothelial and mesenchymal cells. Immunostaining and gene-expression analyses revealed a resemblance between in vitro grown iPSC-LBs and in vivo liver buds. Human vasculatures in iPSC-LB transplants became functional by connecting to the host vessels within 48 hours. The formation of functional vasculatures stimulated the maturation of iPSC-LBs into tissue resembling the adult liver. Highly metabolic iPSC-derived tissue performed liver-specific functions such as protein production and human-specific drug metabolism without recipient liver replacement. Furthermore, mesenteric transplantation of iPSC-LBs rescued the drug-induced lethal liver failure model. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the generation of a functional human organ from pluripotent stem cells. Although efforts must ensue to translate these techniques to treatments for patients, this proof-of-concept demonstration of organ-bud transplantation provides a promising new approach to study regenerative medicine.

        "Ischemic heart disease (IHD) remains the main risk factor for developing heart failure (HF) and is one of the leading causes of morbidity, hospitalization, and deaths worldwide [50, 88]. As recently outlined in a comprehensive overview [28], the burden of IHD and its progression to HF remains a critical global health issue. The lack of regenerative abilities in the human adult heart results in development of fibrotic scar tissue after myocardial infarction replacing damaged cardiomyocytes. By influencing the tissue stiffness, such a scar prevents the heart from being filled with blood or pumping properly, leading to remodeling and ultimately to heart failure [74, 88]. Impaired coronary blood flow plays a key role in both initiating and sustaining myocardial dysfunction, acting as both a cause and consequence of heart failure progression [27]. Currently, available pharmacological treatments for HF, including angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), β-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, slow the remodeling process but do not provide a treatment of the underlying cause acting more symptomatic than curative options [60]. In advanced stages of HF, the only treatment options available are the implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and heart transplantation. Despite its “bridge-to-transplant” indication, LVAD implantations are a big advancement in the field, leading to an increased survival rate after 1 and 2 years post-implantation [44]. However, adverse events, such as rehospitalization, stroke, and multi-system organ failure, are frequent [23]. The only solution up to date able to revert the critical condition of HF is heart transplantation. However, the shortage of organs as well as the inability of some patients to receive a transplantation [90] make it an unrealistic standard procedure and require alternative methods.",
        "Given cardiomyocytes' (CMs) limited ability to proliferate postnatally and the limitations in the current state of the art in clinical practice, new approaches are needed to replace CM loss. For these reasons, cardiac research has focused on developing different approaches for heart regeneration in recent decades. These approaches can be generally divided into two main categories: cell-free and cell-based methods [26].",
        "The first category includes all methods using small molecules or transcription factors to induce direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes [32, 84], or the methods that induce endogenous cardiomyocyte proliferation and increase their survival. Micro-RNA (miRNA) [2, 13, 17], long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) [51, 89], circular RNA (circRNA) [2, 29], growth factors like VEGF [24, 94] delivered as modified mRNA (modRNA) [94] and extracellular vesicles [6, 20] showed promising results in the field.",
        "On the other hand, cell-based therapies aim to replace cardiomyocyte loss with cardiomyocytes or cardiac progenitors (CPCs) to provide electro-mechanical support, or with cells whose secretome can reverse the remodeling processes of the damaged myocardium such as mesenchymal stem cells (already reviewed here [91]).",
        "Since the isolation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by Thomson and colleagues in 1998 [85] and the establishment of murine-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Yamanaka in 2006 and in 2007 from human fibroblasts [81, 82], cardiovascular researchers started to consider the idea of differentiating pluripotent cells into cardiomyocytes and use those as the best choice for replacement therapy after myocardial infarction. Together with advancement in the protocols to generate CMs populations with high purity [37, 68], the idea of regenerating the heart with this approach became realistic as evidenced by the numerous ongoing clinical trials [15, 43]. The therapy options developed during these years can be divided in two main categories, which are subjects of this review. The first approach is the direct myocardial injection of PSC-derived CMs as single cell suspensions and the second is the delivery of cardiac PSC-derived tissues as cardiospheres or cardiac patches.",
        "The first works describing cardiomyocyte transplantation in healthy and injured hearts [48, 70], revealed the inherent challenges of the method. These limitations, after years of investigations, could be summed as follows:First of all, survival of injected cardiomyocytes in a hostile environment (such as infarcted heart) is meager and affected by many factors. Cardiomyocytes detached from a matrix activate integrin-mediated cell death pathways (also known as anoikis [7]). Moreover, the hypoxic environment is detrimental because of the nutrient starvation and reduced oxygen concentration, ongoing inflammation and associated cytokines and chemokines release activate different cell death pathways such as TNF-alpha-mediated pathway.Immune rejection could occur since the vast majority of the pre-clinical work done so far did not perform autologous iPSC-CMs transplantation, but allo- or xenotransplantations with regimens of high immunosuppression, which will translate in the clinics in lifelong immunosuppression for the patients.In recent years, many studies described the insurgence of arrhythmias upon the engraftment of PSC-CMs, which could be potentially deadly and are now one of the main limitations for the clinical application of this method [14].",

        "The first work aiming at improving PSC-CMs survival after injection was published in 2007 by Laflamme and colleagues [48]. They developed a solution to address the survival and immunological problems of hiPSC-CM therapy. They treated human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) with a so-called “pro-survival cocktail” (Fig. 1). This was reported in different studies [5, 10, 54, 73] (with small variations) to enhance cell survival after transplantation. The pro-survival cocktail, as proposed by Laflamme and colleagues, was composed of: reduced growth factors Matrigel (providing a substrate, which prevents cells from undergoing anoikis), ZVAD (pan-caspase inhibitor, preventing cell death), BCL-XL BH4 (BCL-XL recombinant protein, preventing apoptosis), Cyclosporine A (it prevents an infiltrating immune cell invasion into the myocardium from the host), IGF-1 (pro-survival protein), pinacidil (vasodilator, improving the perfusion of the engrafted cells). The pretreatment of hESC-CMs with the pro-survival cocktail showed, in Laflamme’s study, enhanced survival of the cells after transplantation in the infarcted murine hearts, and an improved heart function with increase in fractional shortening and reduced left-ventricular end-diastolic and left-ventricular end-systolic dimensions.Fig. 1Different approaches to enhance PSC-CMs survival and retention after myocardial injection",
        "Different approaches to enhance PSC-CMs survival and retention after myocardial injection",
        "A different approach was, then, used in 2011 by Joseph Wu’s group. Their study showed how miRNAs could play a critical role in improving cell engraftment [30] (Fig. 1). MiRNAs are 18–25 nucleotide long non-coding RNAs, which have been widely investigated in the last decades as main targets for drug development and disease modeling, because of their pivotal role in, virtually, all biological processes through post-transcriptional repression of gene expression [1, 2, 19, 56, 86]. After screening miRNAs, previously reported for having pro-survival or anti-apoptotic functions, they selected miR-21, miR-24, and miR-221 as candidates to increase survival of CMs. They infected mouse-derived cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) with lentiviruses carrying a combination of the aforementioned miRNAs and could show an improvement in survival of the cells and an improvement in fractional shortening in an infarcted SCID mouse model. However, more studies are needed to prove the long-term efficacy and safety of lentiviral delivery of miRNAs cocktails in the injected cells and myocardium. Moreover, upregulation of miRNA-21 is known to induce fibrosis in the myocardium via exosome transfer requiring more in-depth investigation [86].",
        "Genetic manipulation prior to cell engraftment could be an option to enhance cell survival and integration into the host myocardium, being the rationale for the work published by Zhu and colleagues in 2018 [97]. They generated a cell line overexpressing CCND2 (cyclin D2), a known cell proliferation inducing cyclin, to enhance transplanted CM proliferation during the engraftment (Fig. 1). They could demonstrate that a higher proliferation rate of hiPSC-CMs results in higher engraftment efficiency and higher vascularization in the infarcted mouse hearts. A second study was published by the same group in 2021, investigating the therapeutic efficacy of CCND2 overexpression in hiPSC-CMs, using a large animal model [96]. They demonstrated that cyclin D2 overexpression in hiPSC-CMs was beneficial for the recipient pig hearts improving ejection fraction, preventing post-infarct hypertrophy, and reducing the scar size. They could show that CCND2 overexpression affected not only hiPSC-CMs proliferation but also host CMs and endothelial cells (ECs) proliferation. Mechanistically, they attributed these effects to the modulation of the YAP/TAZ development-related pathway, through miRNAs delivered by extracellular vesicles released by hiPSC-CMs. However, their approach raises some questions about safety since it has been reported that YAP/TAZ pathway is involved in cancer and fibrosis development, increasing the risks associated with its over-activation [25, 36, 63, 92]. While the authors speculate that the shortage of telomeres will eventually lead to a stop in the proliferation rates of the transplanted CMs, more long-term studies are needed to prove the safety of this method.",
        "Again, the same group published a different study in 2020 using genetic manipulation to enhance cell integration and survival after hiPSC-CM transplantation. Here the authors overexpressed the adherens junctions’ component N-Cadherin [55], a protein crucial for maintaining intercalated disks which facilitate the electro-mechanical coupling between cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1). N-cadherin loss results in altered formation of intercalated disks, loss of cell-to-cell interaction, development of dilated cardiomyopathy, and impaired cardiac function [47]. In Lou and colleagues’ study, the lentivirus-mediated overexpression of N-cadherin in hiPSC-CMs before transplantation led to a significant increase in connexin 43 expression, higher engraftment rate, higher vascularization, and smaller infarct size in the engrafted murine hearts. The authors attributed these effects to activating pro-survival and neoangiogenesis pathways. Concerns remain regarding the lentiviral overexpression and the upregulation of connexin 43, leading to higher conduction velocity registered in these cells with possible development of severe arrhythmias that were not further analyzed in this study.",
        "One of the main reasons why hiPSC-CMs do not survive the transplantation is the lack of vascularization in the infarcted area, which could lead to a severe hypoxic injury of the cells. Vascularization is a crucial aspect of cell therapy and tissue engineering with promising results not only in cardiovascular research [3, 8, 24] but also in different fields [57, 83]. As shown by Zangi and colleagues in 2013 and Carlsson and colleagues in 2018, a single injection of VEGF-A modified RNA (modRNA) could improve heart function already after 1-week post-infarct by increasing the vascularization in the infarct area and reducing the development of myocardial fibrosis [8, 94]. ModRNAs are RNAs with modified nucleotides incorporated for better transfection efficiency and stability, showing less toxicity and immunogenicity than other gene delivery methods [38, 39, 46, 59]. Zangi et al. could also demonstrate that the newly formed vessels from the VEGF-A modRNA injected group were more stable and less leaky than the ones formed by VEGF-A DNA (a plasmid carrying the coding sequence of VEGF), and they could show that this effect was due to the higher and shorter release of the protein [94]. In the cell therapy context, a higher vascularization of the injury site could provide sufficient oxygen and nutrients to the PSC-derived cells to survive and integrate into the host heart. With this idea in mind, Ai and colleagues pretreated hiPSC-CMs with a VEGF-A modRNA (Fig. 1), showing highly promising results in neovascularization, leading to better survival of engrafted cells compared to the control group in an infarcted rat model [3]. Moreover, in their study, the modVEGF-treated group elicited improved heart parameters such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening compared with the engraftment of iPSC-CMs not treated with VEGF, 4 weeks post-surgery.",
        "A different approach was employed by Sun and colleagues [80] (Fig. 1), using microvessels isolated from adipose tissue and combining them with ESC-CMs to provide early vascularization of the graft to ultimately improve graft survival. They could prove not only improved survival of the transplanted CMs, but also higher fractional shortening of the injected hearts when compared to CM injection alone and CMs combined with dispersed endothelial cells. Furthermore, they have proven how the engrafted microvessels anastomosed with the host cardiac vasculature.",
        "There is more work investigating co-transplanting CMs with another type of cells. In fact, in 2019, Bargehr and colleagues engrafted both, hESC-CMs and hESC-derived epicardial cells (hiESC-EPI) in infarcted athymic rat hearts, showing, again, improvement in heart function, when compared to the ESC-CMs group only [5]. They could demonstrate that their results were mainly due to paracrine signals from hESC-EPI, which led to a higher proliferation in ESC-CMs and higher grade of vascularization.",
        "The next step was made shortly after by Cheng and colleagues, by co-transplanting hiPSC-CMs and hiPSC-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-EC) both, in mice and non-human primates (NHPs) [10]. They first detected a higher maturity in hiPSC-CM co-cultured with hiPSC-EC, compared to the ones cultured alone. Afterwards, they engrafted hiPSC-CMs alone or in combination with hiPSC-EC in mice and then, in NHPs (in the latter, 28 days post-ischemia–reperfusion injury, as a chronic injury model), showing bigger graft size, improved heart function, and lower arrhythmogenicity in the co-transplantation group as compared to the hiPSC-CM group alone. They attributed these effects to the more extensive neovascularization and higher maturity of the engrafted hiPSC-CMs promoted by the co-transplantation of hiPSC-ECs.",
        "In summary, pro-survival cocktails and genetic manipulations to improve “on-site” revascularization are valid approaches to improve cardiac cell therapy, and a combination of them could probably pave the way toward a clinical application (Fig. 1, Table 1).Table 1How to improve the survival of transplanted hiPSC-CMsRationaleStrategyTreatmentReferencesIncreasing survivalDecreasing apoptosisPro-survival cocktailsAnti-apoptotic/pro-survival chemicalsAnti-apoptotic/pro-survival miRNAs[48][30]Enhancing CM proliferation/Enhancing integrationGenetic manipulationLentiviral overexpression of Cyclin D2Lentiviral overexpression of N-cadherin[97][96][55]Increasing oxygen and nutrients support to the graftsIncreasing vascularizationModVEGF-overexpressionMicrovessels co-transplantationPSC-EC co-transplantation[3][80][10]",

        "A different approach to enhance CMs survival and retention within the host heart is to create a cardiac microenvironment before transplantation. Different groups explored the possibility of using heart-derived cardiospheres, cardiac spheroids, or cardiac patches to improve the survival of the grafts and cardiac performance upon transplantation.",
        "Spheroids are assembled by culturing one or multiple cell lineages that spontaneously aggregate to form adherent populations [18, 62]. In 2015, Gallet et al. performed a series of proof-of-concept experiments, proving that self-assembling cardiospheres derived from minipig hearts were able to remuscularize infarcted pig hearts when infused in coronary arteries, giving benefits in terms of vascularization within the infarct area, decrease in adverse remodeling (less collagen deposition after the ischemic injury), and improvement in heart parameters, such as ejection fraction [21]. Furthermore, they could prove the safety of intracoronary infusion of particles > 45 µm, without obstructing heart vasculature. In 2021, Jun Fujita’s group aimed to use the approach of transplanting cardiac spheroids to increase the survival of the transplanted cells (Fig. 2) [41]. Using cryoinjury as a heart failure model, Fujita and colleagues transplanted cardiac spheroids (composed of a highly pure population of hiPSC-CMs) in immunocompromised rats and pigs, showing larger engraftment size than dispersed CMs and improvement in cardiac function. They observed that after 2 months post-transplantation, both in rats and pigs, the CMs hardly survived in the host hearts. The benefits were, therefore, mechanistically linked to a higher secretion of VEGF from the grafts followed by a higher vascularization. A second study using cardiac spheroids was published in 2024, by the same group [45]. In this study, the authors transplanted two doses of hiPSC-derived cardiac spheroids (hiPSC-CS) for evaluation for later clinical trial (named LAPiS, NCT04945018). They evaluated retention, integration, and maturation, through immunofluorescence staining, demonstrating not only that a higher maturation of the engrafted cells could be achieved faster in cardiac spheroids when compared to other studies using dispersed hiPSC-CMs [52], but also that a lower dose of CMs is sufficient for a clinical setting (probably because of a higher survival and retention of engrafted cells). It is also worth mentioning that this last study was the one that used the highest purity of ventricular CMs (> 99% positive for cTnT), which could explain the higher maturation and lower incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. These two studies paved the way for the use of standardized protocols for hiPSC-CM application that could, in the future, be applied to clinical practice for the treatment of heart failure. However, more studies are needed to investigate in more details different aspects, such as immune rejection and the insurgence of potentially fatal arrhythmias.Fig. 2PSC-derived heart tissues and their application in infarcted hearts",

        "So far, we have discussed methods to improve the myocardial delivery of cells or spheroids injected into the heart /coronary vessels; however, parallel to this, several groups developed a different approach: laboratory-grown heart tissues that can be applied epicardially (cardiac patches, Fig. 2) [93]. Cardiac patches can be composed of cell sheets [22, 75] or cells combined with different types of scaffolds [22, 49, 98, 99]. The first studies in using non-injection-based cell therapy delivery were published in 2002 and 2006 by Zimmermann and colleagues [98, 99]. Mixing neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with collagen I, Matrigel, and medium in a circular mold, they generated contracting engineered heart tissue (EHT, Fig. 2) and transplanted them in non-infarcted [98] (as a proof of concept for feasibility) and infarcted rat hearts [99]. In infarcted rats, they could demonstrate the benefits of cardiac patches in terms of heart performance, but they also showed for the first time the electrical coupling between host and graft and vascularization of the patch. Different works focused on the benefits of the cardiac patches compared to the myocardial injection of dissociated single PSC-CMs, the first one published in 2009 by Hamdi and colleagues [22]. They used two different scaffolds to engraft human myoblasts: one was a fibrin-based scaffold, which was degraded after 9 days and then substituted by a collagen film for the delivery, and one was a collagen sponge (Gelfoam, already used in different context of tissue engineering [66, 67]). They compared the intramyocardially injected myoblasts with the ones which were scaffold-embedded (in a comparable cell density) and applied epicardially, showing for the last a better outcome on heart function, less fibrosis, and higher angiogenesis. Similar results were obtained by Sekine and colleagues in 2011 using neonatal rat cardiomyocyte-derived sheets, obtained by culturing the cells in temperature-sensitive culture dishes and detaching them by cold [75]. They demonstrated that the cell sheets are engrafting more efficiently compared to single cells, translating into a better recovery of the hearts after MI and a better vascularization of the tissue. Similar to the CMs injection, also in the cardiac patch field, an important topic is the vascularization of the transplanted tissue. To achieve a clinically relevant result, the patches used for large mammals and human purposes are expected to be thicker and larger than the ones used for rats and mice, but lacking vasculature, this could affect nutrient and oxygen diffusion to the core of the patch decreasing the survival of the graft [53], creating a necrotic core as already observed in different studies [16, 79]. Different approaches to enhance vascularization within the cardiac patches [53] have been proposed. The first method which has been applied since long time in the field is to mix PSC-CMs with endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Two independent groups reported the advantage of including HUVECs or PSC-EC, necessary to form vessels, and embryonic fibroblasts, necessary to stabilize them [9, 78]. It is notable that the vessels formed in the patches anastomosed with the host when transplanted into rat hearts [78]. Another approach, reported by Noor and colleagues in 2019, is to bioprint a patch with endothelial cells building perfusable vasculature similar to the human host myocardium [65]. Different scaffold-based methods have been reported, describing the use of more porous materials that allow a better diffusion of oxygen, since the size of the pores is important to create an optimal environment for neovasculogenesis [12, 53]. An alternative is to fuse smaller EHTs to increase the tissue size prior to transplantation by creating mesh-like bigger structures (Fig. 2), enhancing the area for oxygen diffusion, method that has already proven itself in remuscularizing animal hearts [69]. The advancements in cardiac patch technology are promising, but still much work is necessary to improve the vascularization of the patches and the standardization of this method.",
        "Cardiac patches represent today one of the leading methods in regenerative cardiology investigated for the treatment of heart failure patients. In recent years, many publications showed the possibility of building bona fide human myocardium, changing cellular and extracellular patch composition. One of the first steps prior to a clinical application of cardiac patches was the confirmation that they engraft long term in myocardial infarction models and contribute to slowing down remodeling and fibrotic processes as demonstrated by Wu group in 2015 [71]. In this study, Riegler and colleagues engrafted engineered heart tissue in a chronic myocardial infarction rat model, without achieving sufficient functional improvement (probably due to the lack of cell integration by gap junction formation between graft and host) but they could demonstrate two important points: first, it was possible to monitor the graft for a maximum of 220 days, showing a better alignment and maturation of the CMs; second, they showed that the scaffold itself had beneficial effects. Another step moving closer to a clinical application was the standardization of patch casting and composition under good manufacturing practice, performed by the Zimmermann group in 2017 [87]. With their standardized composition (equivalent fractions of CMs: non-cardiomyocytes cultured in Matrigel constructs, in serum-free medium, comprising growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2 [FGF-2], insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], transforming growth factor-β1 [TGF-β1], vascular endothelial growth factor 165 [VEGF165]), they could show differentiation characteristics not reported before. The CMs achieved rod shape with well-defined and aligned sarcomeres, with the predominant expression of the ventricular isoform of the myosin light chain (MLC2V), ventricular-like action potential, and a positive force–frequency relationship present only in post-natal hearts. At the end of the study, the authors showed the scalability of their engineered heart myocardium, using custom-made scaffolds to create 15 × 17 mm and 35 × 34 mm patches. Afterward, the same group tested their findings engrafting rhesus EHTs in healthy and infarcted rhesus macaques, which could be detected up to 6 months (endpoint of the study) [34]. In this study, they could show a good dose-dependent enhancement of heart contractility and ejection fraction. On a histological level, they showed vascularization of the EHT at 3 and 6 months, but a relatively immature CM population in the patch, with higher expression of immature isoforms of troponin I and regulatory myosin light chain. These findings and developments are now under investigation in a clinical phase I/II trial (BioVAT-HF, NCT04396899), whose first results are published in the same study [34]. Here, the authors showed the very first human heart treated with cardiac patches, highlighting that the results, in terms of maturation and vascularization, were very similar to the ones observed in monkeys. Regarding the immunological aspects, they could show some infiltration of macrophages and natural killer cells, even though they used quite high immunosuppression levels [34].",
        "A different approach is the one published in 2019 by the Sawa group [40], where they compared major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched CMs sheets with MHC-mismatched CMs sheets transplantation in monkeys’ ischemic hearts. They could demonstrate the benefits for transplantation of both groups in terms of reduction in ventricular dilatation and increase in fractional shortening after 3 and 6 months, showing that in their experimental setting, effects from treatments with grafts of both groups were irrespective of MHC matching. The immunological aspects of this work will be discussed in the next section. These results motivated the authors to establish a protocol to bring the therapy to a clinical trial, which is currently ongoing in phase I [42, 61]. They reported for the first time human engraftment of hiPSC-CM patches, with 3 and 6 months as time points for evaluation of safety and function. The three patients reported had suffered from myocardial infarction in the past and had an ejection fraction ≤ 35% at the time of the surgery. The patients received immunosuppressive treatment for 3 months before it was discontinued. Benefits in reduction of heart volumes and increase in ejection fraction 3 and 6 months post-surgery and enhanced coronary blood flow in two out of three cases were reported. Assuming that after 3 months, the engrafted cells would be cleared out by the immune system, as showed before in monkeys [40], the authors postulated that the benefits observed were mainly due to a better vascularization of the infarcted area, rather than increase in force generation resulting from the graft. On a safety level, patients showed no signs of engraftment arrhythmias (EAs, discussed in the next session) or tumor formation. These first results bring new optimism towards the clinical application of not only cardiac patches but all cardiac, PSC-derived therapies.",
        "The immune surveillance from the host immune system could be one of the main drawbacks for PSC-CM therapies. Most of the work described so far have adopted a common strategy of using high doses of different types of immunosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine A [5, 48, 73], methylprednisolone [3, 73], tacrolimus [3]), or immunocompromised animals were used to avoid rejection in rodents [5, 10, 30, 41]. This translates into an immunosuppressive regimen for the patients if this method is translated into the clinical practice, which is already applied concomitantly in other organ transplantation bearing already known risks [72]. In terms of cost/benefits, the idea of having a lifelong regimen of immunosuppressive drugs for a therapy that has not been yet proven a huge benefit to patients’ hearts does seem questionable. Different studies addressed these concerns. Shiba and colleagues, for instance, generated a monkey iPSC cell line homozygous for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype HT4, injecting, then the differentiated CMs into cynomologus monkeys heterozygous for HT4 to avoid immune rejection [77]. They could demonstrate that in an immunosuppressive regimen, transplanting MHC-mismatched monkeys triggered a severe T lymphocyte response, leading to immune rejection of the engrafted cells. However, when they transplanted iPSC-CMs in MHC-matched monkeys, they showed no intramyocardial immune infiltration after 12 weeks. Still, it is important to mention that the engrafted monkeys were under an immunosuppressive regimen, even if lower doses of drugs were used as compared to other studies. It is notable that in other studies, a higher dose of immunosuppressive drugs was sufficient to avoid immune rejection of the xenografts [10]. Similar work was done by Kashiyama and colleagues, using CMs sheets [40]. As described above, they transplanted MHC-matched and MHC-mismatched CMs sheets in infarcted monkey hearts to evaluate the function and immunogenic response, treating both groups with immunosuppressive drugs, and evaluating the grafts at 3, 4, and 6 months (longer than the previous work from Shiba and colleagues). The CMs sheets survived up to the fourth month but could not be detected after 6 months, in both transplantation groups, showing an immune rejection for both MHC-matched and MHC-mismatched CMs. However, there was a strong infiltration of CD3-positive lymphocytes after 3 months in the MHC-mismatched group only, while in the MHC-matched group, rejection occurred probably through different mechanisms. They also showed that the withdrawal of immunosuppressive drugs after 3 months post-transplantation did not affect the heart function. Therefore, they proposed that after 4 months, different mechanisms are responsible for the rejection of MHC-matched CMs, then CD3-lymphocytes-invasion and MHC-mismatched CM-line could be probably used safely in clinical settings under immunosuppressive therapy for 2 or 3 months [42, 61]. However, more work is needed in this direction to understand the exact mechanisms behind cell graft rejection in the heart. Recently, Lin et al. described long-term engraftment of autologous iPSC-CMs in two monkeys [52]. This elegant study paves the way to autologous manufacturing and engraftment, eliminating the risk of immune rejection and giving a good insight into in vivo maturation of iPSC-derived cells. In fact, in this study, the authors generated two specific cell lines carrying a construct expressing a sodium/iodide symporter (NIS, usually not expressed by cardiomyocytes), which allowed them to trace in vivo the fate of these cells. Based on NIS expression, they could show that after 8 months, the cells underwent maturation: they were not proliferating anymore, they expressed N-cadherin at the intercalated disks, and they lacked expression of the fetal isoform of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC2a), replaced by the adult ventricular isoform MLC2v. However, at this time point, the engrafted cardiomyocytes still expressed slow skeletal troponin I isoform (ssTnI, fetal isoform), and connexin 43 (Cx43) which was not located at the intercalated disks. These signs of incomplete maturation were not present in the second animal, sacrificed after 14 months. No significant differences were observed between host and engrafted cardiomyocytes in this animal, showing a high maturation of the engrafted cells. Moreover, no immune infiltration or rejection of the cells was evident in both monkeys, indicating that autologous cell transplantation could be one of the best options for translating cell therapy into clinical practice. An alternative to autologous transplantation has been shown by Hu et al., investigating the usage of a hypoimmune cell line, generated by knocking down MHC class I and II molecules and overexpressing CD47 [31]. This cell line could escape immune surveillance when transplanted undifferentiated in muscles and differentiated as pancreatic islets in the pancreas of immunocompetent mice. More studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this cell line in the heart. Still, this proof-of-concept work fuels optimism toward the generation of a single cell product that could be used for all patients eliminating the manufacturing problems linked to the generation of an autologous cell line specific for each patient.",
        "In 2014, Murry’s group engrafted hESC-CMs in infarcted NHP for the first time in a dose-finding study to evaluate the integration and vascularization of the grafts. They, then, noted that all the engrafted monkeys presented with arrhythmias which were absent in the monkeys that did not receive the cell treatment (Fig. 3) [11]. The authors described this type of arrhythmias as “premature beats and runs of ventricular tachycardia”, they also noted wide QRS complexes. The authors speculated about the origin of the so-called engraftment arrhythmias (EAs), which were not observed in small animal models. These differences could be attributed to graft size and heart frequency. Bigger heart sizes, such as in monkeys, require a higher number of cells to be transplanted to observe a significant remuscularization effect. The depolarization wave that propagates within the graft could be more substantially slowed by engrafted cells in a bigger graft than a smaller graft, allowing for re-entry mechanisms. On the other hand, the heart frequency of mice and rats are faster, they outpace the slower rates of hiPSC-CMs, not allowing for generation of automaticity (the ability of PSC-CMs to depolarize spontaneously) or re-entry mechanisms. Similar results were obtained by Shiba and colleagues when transplanting monkey hiPSC-CMs in monkeys’ infarcted hearts [77]. Here, they showed sustained ventricular tachycardia in the transplanted group, that peaked at 14 days and declined afterward, probably due to the higher maturation of the cells after this time point. The mechanism underlying EAs remained unclear for many years, until Murry's group first investigated their origin in 2018 [54]. In this study, they engrafted hESC-CMs in primate hearts to study remuscularization and EAs. At first, they generated a myocardial infarction (MI) model that had a bigger size, because in the previous study, MI was very small to appreciate any difference in heart function (left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% versus 65% at baseline) [11]. Once they injected differentiated hESC-CMs, they showed successful engraftment after 4 weeks and 3 months, with improved heart parameters. The engrafted hearts prior to transplantation had an ejection fraction of 39.4 ± 2.1%, whereas after 4 weeks post-engraftment, it increased to 50.0 ± 1.9%. The main finding of this study, however, was the frequency of arrhythmias. They did not show any significant difference in arrhythmias insurgence between injected and control monkeys, but they elegantly demonstrated via electrical mapping, overdrive pacing, and cardio-version studies the different origins of arrhythmia in the two groups. While, in control groups, the arrhythmias were more likely to originate from re-entry mechanisms due to the big infarct sizes, in the cell-treated group, they showed that the insurgence of arrhythmias had an ectopic impulse generation within the ventricle. These findings were confirmed later by Romagnuolo et al. in 2019, using a pig MI model [73]. They performed similar electrophysiological experiments aimed at proving the origin of EAs, showing that the engrafted hiPSC-CMs generated a focal impulse capable of inducing ventricular tachycardia up to 261 bpm ((beats per minute), normal rate of pigs is 90 bpm). They also showed that, after 3 weeks, these arrhythmic events stopped in concomitant with a better cell maturation: higher expression of ventricular isoform of myosin light chain (MLC2v) and switch from fetal troponin I isoform (ssTnI) to the adult cardiac-specific one (cTnI), higher expression and better polarization of connexin 43 (Cx43). This last finding suggests that poor maturation of the cells could lead to spontaneous depolarization and to arrhythmias. Furthermore, in this study, the danger of untreated EAs emerged clearly with one of the tested subjects died because of ventricular tachycardia that degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. For these reasons, it can be assumed that EAs are one of the main obstacles for the translation of hiPSC-CMs cell therapy to humans [14].Fig. 3Proposed EAs treatment options",
        "Proposed EAs treatment options",
        "Interestingly, most of the studies performed with cardiac patches did not show any signs of arrhythmias [35, 40, 71]. This phenomenon could be explained by two different mechanisms. First, the PSC-CMs in the engineered heart tissue display a more mature phenotype compared to the PSC-CM used for myocardial injection. Therefore, it is possible that the cardiac patches have less automaticity properties. The second aspect regards the electrical coupling of the patches with the host heart. In fact, in the latest studies, also shown by Kashiyama et al., the protective mechanism of cardiac patches could derive from a paracrine effect rather than cell integration and electro-mechanical coupling to the host myocardium [40].",
        "Even without a fully clear mechanism on origin of the EAs, the first approach to treat these arrhythmic events was tested by Nakamura et al. in 2021 [64]. This approach was quite intuitive and screened for seven clinically available anti-arrhythmic drugs in a pig MI model to test which one(s) would be able to reduce the beating frequency in the engrafted hearts. They could show that only class III broad-acting amiodarone and funny current/HCN4 channel antagonist ivabradine were promising in controlling the rhythm and rate of EAs, respectively. Furthermore, they were able to show that the two agents are synergistic, acting with different mechanisms with combination of both sufficient to reduce fatal events in the tested subjects (Fig. 3). Interestingly, 4 weeks of treatment with anti-arrhythmic drugs was enough to control EAs until electrical maturation of grafts developed, and later, no EAs occurred in most subjects (5 out of 7 that completed the study). In the remaining two subjects, the EAs could be controlled.",
        "The same strategy was proposed few years later by Selvakumar et al.in 2024. In this study, the Chong group focused on the mechanistic aspect of EAs using a multi-omic approach. First, they divided the infarcted pig subjects into five groups: vehicle, vehicle + anti-arrhythmic drugs (AA, using amiodarone and ivabradine), PSC-CM, PSC-CM + AA, and sham control. Then they evaluated the heart responses to engraftment and AA, demonstrating that PSC-CMs alone were not sufficient to ameliorate the infarct outcome. Still, in combination with AA, they resulted in improved ejection fraction and left ventricle stroke volume. Furthermore, they confirmed that the application of the previously published combination of amiodarone and ivabradine was enough to suppress EAs. The authors were able to identify, among the PSC-CMs, a sub-cluster of CMs presumably responsible for EAs, using a three-gene signature (SIRPA+ CD90− CD200+) and one that, on the contrary, was not linked to EA (SIRPA+ CD90− CD200−). The EA-prone cluster was composed of atrial and pacemaker-like cardiomyocytes, while the second comprised ventricular and trabecular-like CMs (Fig. 3). To validate this finding, they used a differentiation protocol to enrich for the first group and engraft the cells into the pig MI model. This group showed the highest incidence and severity of EAs, with two of three subjects dying due to the EAs and the third being saved only by catheter ablation (CA). This demonstrates that the atrial and pacemaker-like population is likely responsible for the automaticity observed in hiPSC-CMs and EA development [76].",
        "Different solutions have been proposed to overcome the arrhythmia problem as the application of already discussed anti-arrhythmic drugs. In the Selvakumar et al. study, they proposed to have protocols that specifically differentiate the not arrhythmogenic PSC-CMs population, or to use catheter ablation [76]. This procedure aimed to specifically remove the graft foci responsible for EAs with a catheter guided by electroanatomic maps to distinguish the anatomical origin of the EAs (Fig. 3). A different approach could be to improve the electrical maturation of hiPSC-CM before transplantation or in vivo as shown by Cheng et al. in 2023. Using a combination of hiPSC-EC and hiPSC-CMs, they could demonstrate a lower incidence of arrhythmic events compared to hiPSC-CMs alone [10]. The most recent therapeutic option was proposed by Marchiano et al. in 2024 [58] by modulating the expression of specific ion channels and transporters that are important for ion fluxes and responsible for the automaticity properties of PSC-CMs. They knocked out three genes (HCN4, CACNA1H, and SLC8A) responsible for funny currents and phase 4 spontaneous depolarization. Then they knocked in one channel (KCNJ2) accountable for the inward flux of potassium and hyperpolarization of the cell, calling this quadruple-edited cell line MEDUSA (modification of electrophysiological DNA to understand and suppress arrhythmias, Fig. 3). The MEDUSA cell line did not generate EAs when transplanted into pigs, compared with all the other groups which were single knockouts or knock-ins, where EAs were present. Interestingly, as stated by Selvakumar et al. [76], the three knocked-out channels in Marchiano’s study were also highly abundant in the cells with the arrhythmogenic signature (SIRPA+ CD90− CD200+). This gives a different view on the field: when differentiating hPSC to CMs, a highly arrhythmogenic population is generated, which expresses multiple channels responsible for automaticity and EAs. By reducing this population with better-defined differentiation protocols or knocking down the channels responsible for the automaticity, it will be possible to reduce and eventually even eliminate the risk of arrhythmias.",
        "It is well-known that PSC have the ability to generate teratomas when transplanted in immunocompromised subjects, an ability that is also used to test the pluripotency of iPSC lines [95]. This could be a hazard for the health of people receiving PSC-based therapies, as demonstrated also by a case of tumor in a patient in 2009 after neural stem cell therapy [4]. However, development of differentiation strategies with highly pure PSC-CMs, yielding > 95% TnT+ cells, omitted the risk for tumor formation, strongly suggesting that the method is safe. Even if evidence points out to the safety of the method, some groups suggested inserting suicide genes in the cell lines, to eliminate the cells if teratoma formation is present and the same approach could also be used if arrhythmia risk develops [33].",
        "In this review, we discussed how the stem cell therapy field has developed for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. PSC-CMs therapies can remuscularize (at least partially) infarcted hearts. Over the years, scientists developed different strategies, such as the use of pro-survival cocktails, genetic manipulation, co-transplantation strategies, and tissue engineering, to overcome the various challenges they faced to translate this therapy to heart failure patients. Even if more work is needed to unravel the final unknowns, such as the insurgence of EAs and immune rejection mechanisms, we believe the PSC-CM therapy has entered the translation phase into the clinical setting. As testified by the numerous ongoing clinical trials (reviewed elsewhere [43]), we are at a historical moment that can shift the paradigm of heart failure treatment and change patients' lives. Still, a lot of work has to be done not only to understand which are the long-term implications of the therapy, but also to develop differentiation protocols gaining more mature and non-arrhythmogenic cardiomyocytes considering the safety aspects. We can conclude that the perspective of treating patients with PSC-CM is realistic and in the next years, it will be crucial to fully understand its real potential.",

        "Recent advancements in CRISPR technology, including CRISPR-Cas9, base editors, and PE, have demonstrated precise genome correction capabilities. Notably, PE has shown exceptional precision in correcting genetic mutations. Combining PE with iPSC-CMs has emerged as a robust platform for disease modeling and developing innovative treatments for genetic cardiac diseases.",
        "The review finds that PE, when combined with iPSC-CMs, holds significant promise for treating genetic cardiac diseases by addressing their root causes. This approach could revolutionize personalized medicine, offering more effective and precise treatments. Future research should focus on refining these technologies and their clinical applications.",
        "In 2019, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including those caused by genetic and non-genetic factors, accounted for 17.9 million deaths worldwide. Genetic cardiac diseases, characterized by their familial inheritance patterns, lead to critical health issues, including heart failure, fatal arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death [1, 2]. These diseases present significant health risks and impose broad socio-economic and psychological challenges, exacerbating stress, diminishing quality of life, and straining the financial resources of patients and their families. Current treatments primarily focus on symptom management, including both Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) and mechanical assistance devices [3], with heart transplantation being the only curative option in clinical practice. However, the limited availability of donor hearts makes waiting for a transplantation a significant challenge for patients. Given the complexity, difficulty in diagnosis, and limitations of current treatments for these genetic cardiac diseases, there is a demand for the development of precise and innovative therapeutic approaches that can fundamentally address the underlying causes of these disorders.",
        "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-based gene editing represent a revolutionary set of methods that allow for targeted DNA manipulation of cells, plants, and animals, whose genetic change range includes insertions and deletions of varying sizes as well as specific base-pair substitutions [4, 5]. In the past decade, CRISPR-based gene editing tools, including different variant technologies like engineered CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases, base editors (e.g., cytidine and adenine base editors), and prime editors (PE), have been applied in cells, plants, and animals, offering as a result potentially effective treatment options for genetic cardiac diseases [6]. PE stands out for its precision and versatility, providing the potential for correcting a wide range of genetic anomalies with minimal off-target effects [7].",
        "Reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and subsequently differentiating these reprogrammed cells into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) provides a robust “disease-in-a-dish” platform for modeling genetic cardiac diseases and exploring candidate therapeutic treatments such as those involving the screening and testing of small-molecule drugs or gene editing reagents [8, 9]. Combined with PE-mediated genome editing, this cellular reprogramming approach acquires enhanced capabilities for disease modeling as well as opportunities for addressing these genetic cardiac diseases. This review summarizes recent studies on CRISPR-based gene editing tools for directly modeling genetic cardiac diseases and explores their integration with reprogramming technologies. We propose that combining PE with iPSC-CM technologies offers novel perspectives for both the modeling and potentially treatment of genetic cardiac diseases.",
        "Engineered CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) nucleases form a powerful set of genome editing tools that originated from a natural bacterial defense mechanism against phage infections [10]. These CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases consist of a single guide RNA (gRNA)-Cas9 complex. The gRNA-Cas9 complex first recognizes short DNA tracts named protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM) via the PAM-interacting domain of the Cas9 protein. In the case of the prototypic Cas9 nuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes, the PAM reads as NGG where N stand for any nucleotide. Next, the gRNA, formed by linking an invariant trans-activating RNA to a sequence-tailored CRISPR RNA, anneals with specific DNA sequences of typically 20 base pairs (protospacer) complementary to its 5’ end (spacer). Complementarity between RNA spacer and DNA protospacer sequences triggers conformational changes of the two Cas9 nuclease domains (i.e., HNH and RuvC) that ultimately lead to catalytic activation and double-stranded DNA break (DSB) formation 3-bp away from the PAM. Once the DSB is induced, cellular DNA repair mechanisms are activated with, among these, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) [11], homology-directed repair (HDR) [12], and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) [13–16], are being actively exploited for genome editing purposes, e.g., for generating gene knockouts or gene knock-ins. The latter procedures require delivering into target cells DSB-repairing exogenous donor DNA templates encoding the edit(s) of interest.",
        "Beyond genome editing based on engineered CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases, base editing is a technology that permits introducing single base-pair substitutions within a gRNA-defined target site without inducing DSBs and independent of donor DNA usage. Typically, base editor proteins consist of a catalytically disabled version of a Cas9 enzyme that trigger single-stranded DNA breaks, or nicks, rather than intrinsically mutagenic DSBs [17–19]. Fusing these Cas9 nickases to effector moieties in the form of cytidine deaminases and adenosine deaminases, yields cytidine base editors (CBEs) and adenine base editors (ABEs), respectively [20]. Specifically, after gRNA-BE complex target site engagement, DNA denaturation and single-stranded DNA formation, facilitates local deamination by the effector domains. In the case of CBEs, cytosine (C) is deaminated into uracil (U) and via subsequent DNA repair or replication a target C·G base pair is converted into a T·A base pair. ABEs in turn deaminate adenine (A) into inosine (I) with the resulting base pair intermediates being subsequently converted via DNA repair or replication into a G·C base pair. Various CBE and ABE systems have been developed, each of which offering different editing windows and efficiencies [17, 18, 21–23].",
        "PE is an advanced genome editing technology introduced at the end of 2019 [24] that offers increased precision and flexibility over that achieved with BEs and, importantly, with fewer undesired on-target and off-target effects when compared to those resulting from programmable nucleases, RNA-guided or otherwise. It is described as a “search-and-replace” method for precise DNA manipulations, mediating insertions, deletions, and all 12 base-pair conversions requiring in the process neither donor DNA templates nor DSBs [24].",
        "PE1 is the original prime editing system, consisting of a prime editor protein and a prime editing gRNA (pegRNA), which besides the spacer and scaffold sequences of regular gRNAs it has (i) a primer binding site (PBS) that hybridizes with the DNA flap generated after target DNA nicking, (ii) the edit of interest, and (iii) a reverse transcriptase template (RTT). This prime editor is a fusion between the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 H840A nickase and the wild-type reverse transcriptase (RT) from the Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MMLV). An optimized PE2 variant was generated by substituting the wild-type for an engineered MMLV RT variant whose five mutations improve thermostability, RNA–DNA template affinity and DNA synthesis processivity [24]. Similar to the gRNA-Cas9 complex, the pegRNA-prime editor complex binds first to the PAM associated with the intended genomic target site and, after spacer-protospacer hybridization, nicking of the PAM-containing DNA strand by the Cas9.H840A moiety yields a 3’-ended flap that anneals with the PBS of the pegRNA. Subsequently, the annealed product creates a primer for RT-mediated DNA synthesis over the RTT sequence and encoded edit of interest, resulting in a 3' DNA flap that anneals to the complementary genomic DNA. Finally, through endogenous DNA repair mechanisms, the edit of interest is permanently installed at the genomic target site completing the prime editing process [24]. With the further demand for efficient editing, various PE systems have been developed in recent years as shown in Table 1 [25].\nTable 1Overview of representative prime editing systems and their main attributesPink, NLS (Nuclear Localization Signal).

        "Beyond the aforementioned PE2 construct bearing an optimized MMLV RT region for improving the efficiency of reverse transcription [24], further and fast developments are yielding novel PE variants that include PE*, PEmax, and PEΔRnaseH. As previously shown for S. pyogenes Cas9 nucleases [26], prime editing can profit from the addition of nuclear localization signals (NLSs). For instance, PE* has enhanced nuclear localization, hence performance, owing to the addition of two extra NLSs to the both termini of PE2 [27]. PEmax has in turn a codon-optimized RT sequence and two additional mutations in its Cas9.H840A moiety for increased nicking activity [28]. Finally, via the removal of the prime editing-dispensable RNaseH domain, PEΔRNaseH displays a reduced size while maintaining editing efficiency [29, 30], which permits its delivery via carriers with limited cargo capacity, e.g., commonly used adeno-associated viral vectors [31].",
        "In addition to optimizing the construction of PE proteins, adding extra components can further enhance their capabilities. For instance, HyPE2 incorporates the Rad51 DNA-binding domain that is hypothesized to promote DNA/RNA hybrid formation by binding to ssDNA and RNA and, in doing so, enhancing reverse transcription during prime editing. The HyPE2 construct improves PE efficiency by a median of 1.5-fold across various genomic sites and is particularly effective in genomic loci where PE2 demonstrates lower than 1% editing efficiency, achieving significant improvements at up to 34% of target sequences [32].",
        "IN-PE2 enhances prime editing by including dual peptides, NFATC2IP and IGF1, thereby increasing prime editing outcomes across various cell lines and target sites. Velimirovic and co-researchers constructed two constructs, IN-GFP-PE2 and CTRL-GFP-PE2, and found that mESCs possess 1.58 fold higher amounts of IN-GFP-PE2 than of CTRL-GFP-PE2 with degradation occurring at a similar rate. These observations suggested that the two additional peptides increase either transcription or translation of the PE2 enzyme, offering an explanation for the increased activity of IN-PE2 [33]. The PE modality dubbed PE3 builds upon the PE2 system via the addition of a gRNA to direct the induction of another nick on the non-edited strand. This secondary gRNA-directed nick locates at an offset position from the primary nick directed by the pegRNA, enhancing in the process of editing efficiency by promoting the newly edited strand to serve as a template for DNA repair. PE3 and PE3b differ on the location of the additional secondary nick. In particular, in the latter approach, secondary nicking can only take place after edit incorporation as to minizine DSB formation via concomitant nicking of top and bottom DNA strands. Indeed, the PE3 modality can significantly enhance editing efficiency but, typically, it increases the rate of indels due to non-homologous end joining repair of DSBs created by concomitant nicking of top and bottom DNA strands, researchers thus need to consider the balance between editing efficiency and side-effects when selecting specific PE modalities [24]. The PE4 and PE5 systems build on PE2 and PE3 components, respectively, by incorporating a mismatch repair (MMR)-inhibiting protein consisting of a dominant-negative form of the human MLH1 protein (MLH1dn). By temporarily suppressing the cellular MMR pathway, MLH1dn enhances editing efficiency as this pathway tends to resolve mismatches in heteroduplex prime-editing intermediates consisting of edited and unedited strands [28].",
        "Through Phage-Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE) and protein engineering, smaller prime editor variants (516–810 bp coding sequences) were obtained, capable of yielding an editing efficiency improvement of up to 22-fold [34].The PE6 series employs PACE to significantly enhance the compactness of prime editing compared to PEmax and PEΔRnaseH.The PE6a-g variants have improved delivery vehicle compatibilities and editing efficacy in vivo, with one variant achieving a 24-fold improvement in loxP insertion efficiency in the murine brain cortex [34]. The PE7 system incorporates the RNA-binding protein La to enhance the interaction with pegRNAs, improving overall editing outcomes [35]. These diverse prime editors provide various options for achieving heightened genome editing efficiencies in different experimental contexts.",
        "The development of paired or dual prime-editing systems, involving the use of two pegRNAs, represents a pivotal set of technologies offering precise and more versatile prime editing options. Indeed, these systems leverage the strengths of prime editing by incorporating dual pegRNAs that, by working in concert, expand the range of feasible genetic modifications from single base-pair substitutions and small insertions and deletions to larger-scale chromosomal edits. For instance, the Homologous 3′ Extensions Mediated Prime Editor (HOPE) uses paired pegRNAs encoding the same edits on both reverse transcribed DNA strands achieving efficient editing and improved product purity over that obtained with the PE3 system [36]. TwinPE employs two pegRNAs to template the synthesis of complementary DNA flaps on opposing strands of genomic DNA, enabling the programmable replacement or excision of DNA sequences at endogenous sites without double-strand breaks. TwinPE can also be combined with site-specific serine recombinases for targeted integration of large donor DNA into recombinase recognition sequences programmed by dual pegRNAs and, thereby, expand the range of precision exogenous gene insertion strategies. For instance, the combination of TwinPE and BxbI, a serine recombinase, successfully inserted a 5.6 kb DNA sequence into three genomic loci, exhibiting an editing efficiency of 2.5–6.8% [37]. Similarly, by fusing Cas9, reverse transcriptases and large serine integrases, Programmable Addition via Site-specific Targeting Elements (PASTE) achieves targeted gene insertions at efficiencies of ~ 4–5% for large cargos in primary human hepatocytes and T cells [38]. Moreover, GRAND, PRIME-Del, and Bi-PE employ a pair of pegRNAs with reverse transcription templates complementary to each other that are nonhomologous to the target DNA [39–41]. PRIME-Del allows for deletions of up to 10 kb with significantly higher precision and fewer unintended off-target effects than that resulting from using the CRISPR-Cas9 system [40]. PE-Cas9-based deletion and repair (PEDAR) uses dual pegRNAs and a regular Cas9 nuclease fused to a reverse transcriptase for creating large genomic deletions and for replacing DNA fragments (1-10 kb) with an intended exogenous sequence (up to 60 bp). PEDAR was used in a tyrosinemia I mouse model derived by replacing a 19-bp sequence with a ~ 1.3-kb neo-expression cassette at exon 5 of the Fah gene. In particular, Jiang and co-researchers designed two pegRNAs, aimed at deleting the large insertion and inserting the missing 19-bp Fah gene fragment. One week later, they detected a 0.76 ± 0.25% correction rate in PEDAR-treated mice, but no correction in Cas9-treated mice [42]. Additionally, equally building on fusion constructs between Cas9 nucleases and reverse transcriptases, prime editor nuclease-mediated translocation and inversion (PETI) and WT-PE were shown to be capable of generating large genomic deletions and defined chromosomal translocations with efficiencies comparable to that achieve with regular Cas9 nuclease [43, 44].",
        "The continuous innovation in prime editing systems highlights the rapid advancements in the field of gene editing. Each system offers distinct advantages tailored to specific editing requirements, showcasing a remarkable diversity in established and potential applications that can in principle extend to therapeutic gene correction and multiplexing genetic engineering of multicellular organisms.",
        "PE represents a significant advancement in the genome editing field, offering distinct advantages over other CRISPR-based tools (see Table 2). Firstly, unlike CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing, PE achieves DNA editing without creating DSBs, thereby minimizing the risk of undesired outcomes at on-target and off-target sites. Such outcomes include deletions, duplications and translocations at the DNA level and aneuploidy and chromothripsis at the cellular level [25]. Secondly, as it is more flexible, PE is applicable to a broader range of genetic targets and diseases, particularly those requiring multiple edits beyond simple base-pair substitutions [45]. The precision of PE is enhanced by its unique mechanism, which involves the innovative combination of RTT and PBS sequences in a single pegRNA that license specific hybridization steps between RNA and DNA templates. Prime editing offers unprecedented specificity owing to the required multitier complementarity between pegRNA sequences (i.e., spacer, PBS and RTT) and target DNA. These multiple hybridization requirements ensure high-fidelity base incorporation and accurate gene correction [24]. In summary, the versatility, precision, and reduced off-target effects offered by PE enhance the safety and efficacy prospects of these technologies for therapeutic applications.\nTable 2Comparison between CRISPR-Cas9, base editors, and prime editorsGreen DNA represents the target sequences (protospacers) located next to the respective protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sites (now indicated), red and blue sequences represent, respectively, the CRISPR RNA and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (normally fused, not shown here) of the gRNA with the portion hybridizing to the protospacer corresponding to the spacer sequence.

        "PE has effectively corrected small insertions, deletions, and substitutions in various cell types. For correcting point mutation in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene, PE efficiencies ranged from 21% to 38% in HEK293T cells and 22% in myoblasts [46–49]. Introduction of prime editing complexes via high-capacity adenovector particles can further enhance the performance of the editing process [50], including at defective DMD alleles in human myoblasts and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes [51]. Additionally, a﻿ large-scale deletion in the DMD gene, spanning from exon 17 through 55, was successfully achieved using WT-PE [44].",
        "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) delivering chemically-modified pegRNA and prime editor mRNA were used in HAP1 reporter cells to achieve an editing efficiency of 54% [52]. PE-mediated gene editing was successful in iPSC-CMs, achieving notable editing endpoints in cardiomyocytes. For instance, in DMD exon 51–deleted human iPSCs (ΔEx51 iPSCs), PE3-mediated modification of splice donor sites in the dystrophin gene was used to complete a -GT insertion [53]. This approach achieved gene editing efficiencies of up to 54%. After differentiation, the edited ΔEx51 iPSC-CMs were confirmed to have restored dystrophin protein expression when compared to control iPSC-CMs. In the case of the RBM20 R636S mutation, up to 40% correction was observed, releasing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) symptoms [54].",
        "PE has been applied in vivo through viral vector delivery methods. Adenoviral vectors (Advs) delivered PE3 components into a phenylketonuria mouse model yielding up to 11.1% editing efficiencies resulting in 2.0%-6.0% of the wild-type Pah enzyme activity in treated mice [55]. Moreover, Liu and colleagues developed a dual-AAV (adeno-associated viral vector) encoding a split-PE system that retains 75% editing activity of that achieved with the full-length PE construct [56]. These findings underscore the robust capabilities of prime editing for targeted and precise genetic modifications both in vitro and in vivo, opening up new possibilities for treating a wide range of genetic cardiac diseases.",
        "Some mutations of genetic cardiac diseases can lead to arrhythmias such as Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and Short QT Syndrome (SQTS), as well as to structural abnormalities like HCM and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM). These conditions significantly increase the risk of heart failure and even sudden cardiac death. Developing models through reprogramming of human somatic cells into iPSCs and subsequently differentiate the resulting iPSCs into cardiomyocytes is a powerful approach for improving our understanding of the underlying genetic disease-causing mechanisms and, thereby, develop novel therapeutic approaches for these cardiac diseases [57–59]. By introducing a set of defined transcription factors (e.g., the initial “Yamanaka cocktail” Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) into somatic cells, mainly skin fibroblasts or blood cells, triggers cellular reprogramming into iPSCs [60, 61]. These reprogrammed iPSCs possess pluripotency, enabling them to differentiate into any human cell type, including cardiomyocytes [62]. These iPSC-CM models not only aid in investigating cardiac diseases caused by specific genetic mutations, and provide for cellular substrates for drug screening and therapy development. They also overcome the technical and ethical limitations of embryonic stem cell (ESC) use in animal model research and therapeutic development [57, 63].",
        "Patient-derived iPSC-CMs, which carry the genetic information of the donor, exhibit cardiac disease phenotypes, effectively creating disease-in-a-dish systems that enable investigations into the causes of these diseases. For example, the main characteristic of LQTS is a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) [64, 65], that increases the risk of sudden cardiac death. Models of iPSC-CMs from patients with mutations in the NAA10 gene have recreated the LQTS phenotype [66]. Electrophysiological studies have shown prolonged action potential duration (APD) and corrected field potential duration. Researchers have used ICaL blockers to correct the prolonged field potential duration in patient-derived iPSC-CMs, demonstrating their effectiveness as therapeutic models. Similarly, treating iPSC-CMs from patients carrying the KCNQ1/TRPM4 double mutations with verapamil and lidocaine significantly shortened the QT interval [67]. Conversely, SQTS is characterized by an abnormally short QT interval on the ECG, leading to fainting, palpitations, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death [68]. iPSC-CMs carrying the T618I mutation in KCNH2 successfully mimic the clinical manifestations of SQTS, such as shortened action potential duration and abnormally short QT intervals [69].",
        "For cardiac diseases caused by structural abnormalities, tractable patient-derived iPSC-CM models have been developed. HCM is one of the most common genetic cardiac diseases, characterized by abnormal thickening of the left ventricular wall and ventricular septum, leading to heart failure, arrhythmias, and a high risk of sudden death [70]. Patient-derived iPSC-CMs with the MYL2-R58Q mutation were 30% larger than control iPSC-CMs at day 60, exhibited disarray in myofibrils, and had a higher percentage of irregularly beating cells, thereby accurately representing the HCM phenotype with reduced calcium transients [71]. In 2022 and 2023, iPSC-CMs with other HCM mutations like MYBPC3 R326Q [72], TNNT2 Δ160E [73], JPH2 Thr161Lys [74], and RAF1 [75] also exhibited abnormal calcium handling, leading to increased intracellular calcium concentrations. DCM is characterized by left ventricular or biventricular dilation and impaired systolic function, which occurs in the absence of external causes like hypertension, valvular, congenital, or ischemic heart disease [76, 77]. Studies on mutations TNNT2-R173W [78], and TNNT2-R92W [57] have shown that these disruptions interfere with the interactions within the troponin-tropomyosin complex and impair protein kinase A (PKA) binding to sarcomeric microdomains, thereby affecting calcium handling and contractility. Another iPSC-CMs model with mixed DCM/ACM phenotypes carries the PLN p.Arg14del mutation, which exhibit disrupted regulation of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2⁺-ATPase (SERCA2a), impairing calcium handling in cardiomyocytes [79]. Besides successfully replicating cardiac disease phenotypes for hypotheses-driven mechanistic studies, patient-derived iPSC-CM models are also facilitating unbiased high-throughput drug screens using large small-molecule libraries. However, there are some limitations with these models as the maturation status of the obtained iPSC-CMs can significantly hamper definitive conclusions as they normally display gene expression programs of fetal instead of bona fide adult or mature cardiomyocytes. In this regard, longer culture periods, mechanical and electrical stimulation, organoid assemblies, and the use of scaffolds, and exposure to defined small-molecule cocktails have, to different extents, shown to provide for further maturation of iPSC-CMs in vitro. Additionally, challenges include obtaining cells from patients with rare mutations or in determining how specific genetic abnormalities may lead to previously unidentified diseases.",
        "To better establish genotype-phenotype associations, a new approach involves applying gene editing technologies to edit healthy donor-derived iPSCs and, in doing so, create isogenic pairs of mutant and wild-type iPSC-CMs that share the same genetic background. Indeed, unlike patient-derived iPSC-CM models, gene editing allows for the installation of specific mutations within normal, healthy iPSCs. This approach enables the creation of models unrestricted by patient-specific disease conditions, facilitating the construction of genetic mutation-specific disease models, including their isogenic controls, and providing a new platform to study the role and effects of SNPs, structural variants and mutations in specific loci. Recent applications of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have introduced mutations associated with the CACNA1C [80], KCNH2 [81] and hERG genes [82] into healthy donor-derived iPSC-CMs, inducing LQTS1 and LQTS2. These models successfully replicated the LQTS phenotypes, including action potential prolongation and early afterdepolarizations (EADs), without altering the overall genomic expression profile, thereby validating the effectiveness and precision of genome editing techniques. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 has been used to investigate specific mutations in DCM. One study focused on the BAG3 R477H mutation, associated with DCM, and used CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce this mutation into iPSC-CMs derived from healthy donors [83]. This approach allowed researchers to examine the impact of the mutation on cellular structures and functions without the confounding effects of additional genetic variations that might be present in patient-derived cells. Similarly, a mutation TnT-R173W, known to destabilize interactions within the sarcomeric troponin-tropomyosin complex and affect heart contraction mechanics, was studied using CRISPR-Cas9 technology [78]. Gene edited iPSC-CMs derived from healthy donors displayed the same phenotype as that observed in patient-derived iPSC-CM models, offering flexible capabilities to directly study the impact of defined genetic alterations on cardiomyocyte function.",
        "With the rapid advancement of gene editing tools, e.g., CRISPR-Cas9, CBE, ABE, and PE, it has become realistic to treat genetic cardiac diseases in vivo via direct correction or modification of endogenous genes. Indeed, these tools offer a potential therapeutic approach by precisely correcting or altering specific genetic mutations that, as a result, significantly improve cardiac function and prolong life. In patient-derived iPSC-CM models, ABEs have achieved gene correction rates of over 90% for mutations such as RBM20 R634Q and MYH7 R403Q [84], indicating that gene editing is a very promising approach for treating genetic cardiac diseases [54]. The observed successes were extended beyond cellular studies to animal models. A dual-AAV delivered ABE system has demonstrated efficient editing of several mutations associated with HCM, including Lmna c.1621C > T [85], Rbm20 R634Q [54], Myh6 c.1211C > T [86], Myh6 R403Q [87], and MYH7 c.1208G > A (R403Q) [84]. In mouse models, this type of genetic intervention not only achieved high editing efficiency but also resulted in extended lifespans and release of cardiac symptoms, hence effectively correcting simultaneously both the genotype and pathogenic phenotypes.",
        "The integration of PE and cellular reprogramming technologies represents a pivotal achievement in the field of genetic cardiac disease modeling and treatment. This innovative approach combines the high precision of PE in establishing targeted genetic alterations with the versatility of iPSC systems, creating as a consequence powerful platforms for mechanistic research and clinical treatment of these genetic cardiac diseases (see Fig. 1).Fig. 1The integration of cellular reprogramming and prime editing in genetic cardiac disease modeling (left) and treatment (right)",
        "The integration of cellular reprogramming and prime editing in genetic cardiac disease modeling (left) and treatment (right)",
        "Prime editing of healthy donor-derived iPSC-CMs offers a flexible disease modelling approach especially in view of the aforementioned challenges associated with the exclusive use of patient-derived iPSC-CMs. In particular, the incomplete maturation status of iPSC-CMs under most culture conditions, the rare nature of certain genetic diseases, and the difficulty in understanding the disease mechanisms in different genetic backgrounds. For treatment, both ex vivo and in vivo prime editing strategies are possible based on previous studies [84, 85, 87–90]. The former involves harvesting cells from patients, reprogramming them into iPSCs, and then correcting the mutations by prime editing before introducing corrected iPSC-CMs into the patient. This approach not only ensures that the modified cells are free from genetic defects but also reduces the risk of immunological rejection, offering a personalized therapeutic option. In vivo strategies explore the direct application of prime editing within the body of the patient. This approach employs advanced delivery systems to introduce genetic modifications directly in cells from the affected cardiac tissues. Together, these strategies enhance the appeal of using iPSC-CMs in conjunction with prime editing for flexible disease traits modeling and correction.",
        "Prime editing is a powerful gene editing technology, offering higher precision and fewer byproducts like undesired insertions or deletions. However, despite its potential, prime editing applications in genetic cardiac disease treatments remains restricted by several limitations, particularly in the aspects pertaining to the editing efficiency, off-target effects, off-target organ editing, and delivery efficacy.",
        "Previous studies have demonstrated notable editing efficiency of PE in neonatal mice [55], a recent study evaluating editing efficiencies across 54,836 pegRNAs showed an editing efficiency of around 20%, with efficiencies decreasing in primary cells [91]. Additionally, the editing efficiency of PE is influenced by both the target loci and the specific cell types. For instance, the efficiencies of PE-mediated installation of point mutations and small fragment insertions at the HEK3 locus have demonstrated in various cell lines, including HEK293FT cells, K526 cells, U2OS cells, and HeLa cells [24]. Although PE is more precise than CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases, off-target effects at the genome and transcriptome levels will have to be carefully assessed in each individual clinical settings [24]. As aforementioned, it is also crucial that the prime editor and pegRNA operate in an efficient and precise manner at the intended targeted organ. Current delivery systems often lack the precision required to limit action to the target organs, which can lead to uncontrollable effects in other organs. To address this issue, the development of delivery vectors prioritized for heart tissue and the use of heart-specific promoters are promising strategies [92–94]. The delivery efficiency of prime editing components into cells is another factor influencing editing efficiency. The components of PE are larger and more complex than those used in CRISPR-Cas9 and BEs [13, 17, 18, 24]. This complexity makes it difficult to package and deliver these components efficiently, particularly when using commonly used viral vectors, e.g., AAVs which have their packaging size limitations [29, 30, 56, 95]. Alternative viral vectors such as high-capacity adenovectors and baculoviral vectors possess the payload capacity for delivering all PE components in single particles in an efficient manner [50, 96, 97]. Moreover, non-viral delivery methods, such as LNPs and Virus-Like Particles (VLPs), are being explored but generally present lower delivery efficiencies [52, 98].",
        "The integration of iPSC-CM and PE technologies represents a potential approach for genetic cardiac diseases, offering dual advantages of personalized disease modeling and creating therapeutic treatments. In addition, these technologies provide a robust platform for displaying disease mechanisms and drug screening, reflective of patient-specific cardiac phenotypes. Indeed, prime editing enhances disease modeling and treatment by allowing precise genomic modifications without the off-target effects and limitations of CRISPR-Cas9 and BEs.",
        "However, the integration of PE and iPSC-CM technologies is, clearly, not without limitations. Chiefly amongst these, the variability regarding the efficiency and specificity of somatic cell reprogramming and subsequent iPSC differentiation into mature cardiomyocytes potentially affects the consistency and reproducibility of disease models. Moreover, the efficiency and specificity of prime editing can equally greatly vary depending on the target loci and cell types of interest. Importantly, these limitations are being addressed through the development and implementation of novel iPSC differentiation protocols [99], and PE delivery systems that, in in vivo contexts, should ideally display target-organ specificity.",
