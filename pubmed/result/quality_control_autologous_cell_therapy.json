        "Stem cell culture and manufacturing represent the cornerstone of regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and personalized therapies, offering immense opportunities to address a wide range of medical conditions [1, 2, 3]. The ability to cultivate, expand, and differentiate stem cells into functional cell types has propelled this field into the spotlight of biomedical research.",
        "However, the inherent complexity of stem cell cultures—including their sensitivity to environmental conditions, variability in behavior, and dependence on precise handling—underscores the urgent need for rigorous and scalable quality control measures [4, 5]. Maintaining consistent safety and culture quality is critical for both reproducibility and therapeutic success [6, 7].",
        "Despite advances in imaging, sensor technologies, and omics profiling [8, 9, 10], traditional quality control practices remain labor‐intensive, destructive, and poorly scalable [11, 12]. Widely used methods such as semi‐automated microscopy, flow cytometry, and immunostaining offer limited temporal resolution and often fail to provide real‐time, actionable insights during critical stages of culture growth and differentiation [13, 14].",
        "As shown in Figure 1, conventional methods largely rely on fixed time‐point sampling and destructive assays, limiting their utility for large‐scale or dynamic applications. This gap is especially evident in clinical‐grade production, where robust, scalable, and minimally invasive monitoring systems are required [15, 16]. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative enabler in this space, offering capabilities for real‐time data analysis, predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and automated feedback control [17, 18, 19]. By integrating heterogeneous data streams—including high‐resolution imaging, environmental sensor data, and multi‐omics profiles—AI systems can dynamically track critical quality attributes (CQAs), forecast culture trajectories, and proactively guide process interventions [20, 21].",
        "A visual comparison of conventional quality control approaches—based on manual endpoint assays—and AI‐enabled monitoring systems that integrate real‐time imaging, predictive modeling, and feedback control (created using biorender.com).",
        "However, integration of AI into stem cell workflows remains fragmented. Key challenges—such as data heterogeneity, lack of interpretability, and the absence of validated frameworks for regulatory compliance—have limited its widespread adoption and translation beyond proof‐of‐concept studies [22, 23, 24].",
        "Recent developments in large‐scale mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) production for therapeutic applications have further underscored the need for robust quality control and scalable automation strategies to ensure consistency and clinical efficacy [25]. In parallel, scaling cell therapy bioreactors to industrial levels presents significant challenges, necessitating innovative control approaches to manage turbulence, maintain homogeneity, and ensure reproducible cell yields [26].",
        "To address these gaps, this review introduces a structured analytical framework for AI‐driven quality monitoring in stem cell cultures. We systematically explore: (i) CQAs relevant to stem cell applications, (ii) AI technologies enabling real‐time monitoring and predictive control, (iii) practical applications with comparative insights, (iv) integration challenges, and (v) innovative future directions. By synthesizing current technologies and proposing a unified perspective, we aim to provide a roadmap toward scalable, reproducible, and clinically compliant stem cell biomanufacturing (Figure 2) [27, 28].",
        "Conceptual framework for AI‐driven quality monitoring in stem cell cultures, linking critical quality attributes (CQAs) with corresponding AI technologies and control strategies. This framework structures the discussion in the subsequent sections (created using biorender.com).",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details CQAs in stem cell cultures, Section 3 describes AI technologies enabling quality control, Section 4 discusses practical applications and comparative case studies, Section 5 analyzes integration challenges, Section 6 proposes future directions, and Section 7 concludes the review.",
        "CQAs refer to the physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological properties that must be maintained within specific limits to ensure the safety, efficacy, and quality of stem cell‐derived products [6]. Unlike critical process parameters (CPPs), which are operational variables such as pH or oxygen levels, CQAs directly influence cell fate and function [4, 7].",
        "Figure 3 summarizes the major CQAs relevant to stem cell‐derived product manufacturing and highlights corresponding AI‐enabled monitoring strategies. By leveraging diverse AI models—ranging from CNNs for morphological assessment [29], to predictive algorithms for environmental condition control [30], and deep learning tools for tracking genetic integrity [31]—this framework enables earlier, more accurate, and noninvasive quality assessment compared to traditional endpoint assays. These AI‐assisted approaches serve as the foundation for dynamic, real‐time quality monitoring pipelines essential for scalable and robust stem cell biomanufacturing [32].",
        "Key CQAs and their monitoring approaches. AI tools enable earlier, noninvasive, and dynamic tracking compared to traditional static assays (created using biorender.com).",
        "Table 1 outlines the mapping between major CQAs and AI tools used to monitor or control them.",
        "Mapping critical quality attributes to AI monitoring strategies.",
        "AI offers a more scalable, interpretable, and proactive approach compared to traditional endpoint assays, which are often destructive, labor‐intensive, and fail to capture dynamic trends [11, 12].",
        "Cell morphology, viability, and proliferation rate are primary indicators of stem cell quality. Traditional assessment methods—such as manual microscopy and flow cytometry—offer only static snapshots and are highly dependent on human expertise [13, 42]. These techniques are time‐consuming and lack the resolution to detect subtle phenotypic changes [43].",
        "AI‐driven approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable continuous, noninvasive tracking of morphological changes. For instance, Fan et al. [29] demonstrated over 90% accuracy in predicting iPSC colony formation without labeling or destructive sampling.",
        "In addition to morphology, proliferation trends can be inferred in real time via AI‐assisted live‐cell imaging. Padovani et al. [44] applied automated image segmentation to track cell cycle phases, which could be enhanced by AI for real‐time application. While EdU and BrdU incorporation offer precision, AI models analyzing label‐free data—for example, confluency progression—are now being evaluated as viable surrogates [45].",
        "Stem cells are acutely sensitive to their microenvironment, including nutrient availability, gas exchange, pH, and shear forces [46, 47]. Deviation from optimal conditions can significantly impact viability, differentiation, and lineage fidelity [48, 49].",
        "Traditional environmental monitoring relies on offline sampling or threshold‐based control. In contrast, AI‐powered real‐time monitoring systems use predictive models trained on historical sensor data to detect subtle anomalies. For example, Xie et al. [30] implemented a model to predict future oxygen saturation dips hours in advance based on high‐frequency input from dissolved oxygen and lactate sensors.",
        "Reinforcement learning has also been used to dynamically adjust environmental parameters. Komarova et al. [40] showed that gas composition adjustments guided by an RL algorithm improved expansion efficiency of stem cell cultures by 15%.",
        "Maintaining genetic and epigenetic integrity is crucial for the safety and reproducibility of stem cell‐based therapies [50, 51]. Extended passaging often leads to genetic drift, chromosomal abnormalities, and epigenetic reprogramming [52, 53], threatening clinical viability.",
        "Traditional assessments rely on low‐throughput techniques like karyotyping or microarrays. AI enables multi‐omics integration—fusing genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomic data—to model patterns of instability. For example, Smith et al. [31] used deep learning to detect latent instability trajectories by combining RNA‐seq and SNP profiles. Similarly, Shahir et al. [38] proposed graph‐based models for identifying subpopulations with early aberrant gene expression.",
        "The ability of stem cells to commit to target lineages while avoiding off‐target differentiation is central to their therapeutic utility [54, 55]. Monitoring this transition in real time has remained a challenge, as traditional methods rely on endpoint marker expression or immunostaining.",
        "Recent AI approaches have shifted toward trajectory‐based modeling. For instance, Buggenhagen et al. [56] developed a classifier trained on time‐series imaging and gene expression to forecast differentiation outcomes with 88% accuracy. In pancreatic beta cell protocols, SVM classifiers trained on brightfield images have achieved over 90% sensitivity in distinguishing endocrine lineage commitment stages [36]. Seeding strategies critically influence the metabolic profiles and differentiation potential of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into pancreatic progenitors, underlining the importance of precise process controls to maintain desired CQAs [57].",
        "Contamination remains one of the most costly risks in stem cell manufacturing. Detection is traditionally done through visual inspection, microbial assays, or mycoplasma tests [58, 59]. These methods are time‐delayed and reactive.",
        "AI‐based contamination detection uses pattern recognition on both sensor streams (e.g., sudden pH or O2 shifts) and microscopy data. For example, Burnett et al. [32] trained a Random Forest model on 48‐h pH, oxygen, and glucose trends to predict contamination with 93% accuracy—12 to 24 h earlier than manual identification. CNNs applied to time‐lapse imagery can detect subtle visual markers—such as granular debris or disrupted monolayers—indicative of microbial growth [39].",
        "AI has introduced powerful new capabilities to automate, accelerate, and enhance the quality control of stem cell cultures [20]. Rather than simply replacing manual observation, AI technologies enable real‐time, dynamic, and predictive monitoring of critical culture attributes.",
        "Figure 4 outlines how different AI methods are mapped to specific quality monitoring challenges. Rather than an exhaustive listing, this figure aims to contextualize the selection of AI tools based on the type of CQA being assessed.",
        "Mapping of AI tools to critical quality monitoring tasks in stem cell manufacturing. Each technique addresses specific limitations of traditional QC workflows, enhancing scalability, reproducibility, and predictive capacity (created using biorender.com).",
        "Traditional microscopy relies heavily on manual interpretation, which is prone to subjectivity and limited scalability [60]. AI‐driven machine vision, particularly CNNs, enables high‐throughput, objective analysis of stem cell images. CNN‐based classifiers, as illustrated in Figure 5, have achieved over 90% accuracy in identifying morphological indicators of pluripotency, outperforming manual assessments by a margin of 15%–20% in precision and reproducibility [29, 61]. These models detect subtle shifts in morphology—such as changes in colony shape or granularity—that human observers often miss. CNN‐based models, illustrated in Figure 6, enable high‐resolution tracking of morphological shifts during proliferation and differentiation with improved precision and scalability.",

        "Illustration of CNNs enabling automated cell morphology assessment and real‐time tracking of proliferation and differentiation (created using biorender.com).",
        "However, CNNs are highly dependent on training dataset quality. Variations in imaging conditions, microscope settings, or staining methods can significantly impact model performance [39]. Data augmentation and domain adaptation techniques are increasingly employed to mitigate these challenges.",
        "Dynamic behaviors such as proliferation, motility, and colony expansion provide critical insights into culture health. Traditional tracking is labor‐intensive and prone to error. Highly sensitive real‐time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays have been developed to precisely quantify MSCs in vivo, supporting noninvasive monitoring methods necessary for clinical‐grade stem cell manufacturing [62]. AI models applied to time‐lapse microscopy—such as those developed by Schwarz et al. [35]—automate tracking with higher temporal resolution. They reduce manual annotation time by up to 70% and detect early deviations from expected proliferation rates. Despite these advantages, dynamic tracking systems must address drift and identity loss in long‐term imaging. Integrating imaging data with environmental metadata may improve robustness in future implementations.",
        "Limited annotated datasets hinder the training of robust image‐based AI models. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a solution by creating realistic synthetic images to augment datasets. For example, Khanal et al. [34] demonstrated that GAN‐augmented datasets improved CNN classification accuracy by 12% when identifying differentiated versus undifferentiated colonies. GANs help balance rare classes, enhancing the ability to detect rare events such as early apoptosis or off‐target differentiation. Nevertheless, GAN‐generated data risks introducing artifacts if not properly validated. Techniques such as visual Turing tests and biological plausibility metrics are recommended for quality control of synthetic datasets.",
        "Predictive modeling forms the backbone of proactive quality management in stem cell manufacturing. Rather than detecting failures after they occur, AI models forecast CQAs based on historical and real‐time data [63]. Regression models, such as support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regressors, have been widely used to predict continuous variables like confluency, metabolic activity, or differentiation stage. For instance, Xie et al. [64] demonstrated that predictive modeling based on phase‐contrast imaging could anticipate optimal subculture timing with 92% accuracy, reducing unnecessary manipulations and improving batch viability. Classification models, such as SVMs and decision trees, are applied to categorical outcomes. Singh et al. [36] used SVM classifiers on phase contrast microscopic images to predict differentiation status, achieving sensitivities above 90% across multiple lineage markers.",
        "Despite promising results, model overfitting remains a concern—particularly when training data do not capture batch‐to‐batch variability or protocol deviations. Active learning and uncertainty quantification strategies are being explored to mitigate these limitations.",
        "AI models incorporating sequential datasets—spanning multiple days of culture—enable dynamic predictions of culture trajectories. Multistage modeling approaches, as shown by Zhang et al. [65], track changes over time rather than static snapshots, improving the early detection of differentiation failures by 20%–30%. Multitask learning further enhances model utility by simultaneously predicting multiple CQAs (e.g., viability and differentiation stage), reducing computational cost, and improving interpretability [66]. However, managing temporal data increases complexity. Temporal models must address missing data, variable sampling rates, and nonlinear progression trends, which require careful model architecture design.",
        "Real‐time feedback systems leverage AI to create closed‐loop biomanufacturing processes. By continuously monitoring environmental and cellular parameters, they autonomously adjust culture conditions to maintain optimal growth environments.",
        "Early work by Csaszar et al. [41] demonstrated real‐time cytokine feedback to optimize hematopoietic stem cell expansion. More recently, reinforcement learning (RL) models have been used to dynamically optimize gas composition, feeding schedules, and temperature controls, improving yield consistency by up to 18% in test environments [40].",
        "Nevertheless, challenges such as sensor drift, biofouling, and communication lags between sensors and control algorithms must be addressed. Digital twin technologies—virtual models of bioreactor systems updated in real time—are emerging as promising strategies to enhance feedback accuracy and robustness.",
        "A schematic overview of how AI‐driven predictive models integrate real‐time data to forecast CQAs and dynamically guide process interventions is presented in Figure 7.",
        "A step‐by‐step flowchart demonstrating how AI models process historical and real‐time data to forecast CQAs, detect deviations, and optimize stem cell culture conditions dynamically (created using biorender.com).",
        "Multi‐omics analysis—combining genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics—provides a comprehensive view of stem cell culture health [9]. However, the high dimensionality and complexity of multi‐omics data necessitate advanced AI tools for integration and interpretation.",
        "Deep learning models such as autoencoders, graph neural networks, and multi‐view clustering have been successfully applied to fuse omics layers. For instance, Wang et al. [67] integrated transcriptomic and proteomic profiles to predict pluripotency maintenance markers with a 15% improvement in predictive accuracy over single‐omics models.",
        "Despite these successes, challenges include data normalization across modalities, missing value imputation, and biological interpretability of latent features. Graph‐based models such as Cello‐Graph [38] have shown promise by explicitly modeling cell‐cell communication networks.",
        "Scalability remains a bottleneck, particularly as culture systems move toward industrial‐scale manufacturing requiring real‐time multi‐omics surveillance.",

        "A schematic representation of how AI integrates genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data to provide a holistic assessment of stem cell quality and differentiation potential (created using biorender.com).",
        "Interpretability is critical for the clinical translation and regulatory approval of AI‐driven stem cell quality monitoring systems, as it enables researchers to validate and trust the outcomes of these models. Explainable AI (XAI) methods enhance the robustness and reliability of real‐time monitoring by making AI decision‐making transparent, a benefit demonstrated in recent chromatographic protein purification processes, where deep learning interpretability significantly improved process control and operational trust [68]. In stem cell contexts, attention‐based models such as SCEMILA have been employed to identify diagnostically relevant cells in hematological datasets, offering insights into the most influential features driving classification decisions [69]. For image‐based analysis, techniques like Grad‐CAM (Gradient‐weighted Class Activation Mapping) help visualize which regions of stem cell colony images contribute most to AI predictions [70], while in multi‐omics applications, feature attribution approaches such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) rank genetic, proteomic, or metabolic markers based on their importance in outcome predictions. Despite their advantages, these interpretability tools can sometimes come at the cost of reduced model complexity or predictive performance, making it essential to strike a balance between transparency and accuracy, particularly when working with deep learning models applied to high‐dimensional biological data. Figure 9 illustrates XAI enabling transparency.",

        "Key technical, ethical, and operational barriers to AI implementation in stem cell manufacturing are summarized in Table 3, highlighting the need for data standardization, scalable infrastructure, and improved clinical integration strategies.",
        "Summary of key challenges in AI integration for stem cell quality monitoring.",
        "Stem cell culture generates heterogeneous datasets—ranging from high‐resolution microscopy images to real‐time bioreactor sensor outputs to multi‐omics profiles. These datasets differ widely in dimensionality, noise levels, and sampling frequencies [71].",
        "Without standardized data preprocessing and integration protocols, AI models risk overfitting to specific datasets, thereby reducing generalizability across laboratories or production sites. This severely limits regulatory acceptance, where models must demonstrate reproducibility under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions.",
        "Collaborative initiatives, such as open annotated datasets and harmonized data pipelines, are crucial to overcome this barrier [72].",
        "Scaling AI models from benchtop systems to industrial bioreactors presents major operational challenges. The volume and velocity of data—terabytes per day in large facilities—strain both computational infrastructure and model inference speeds.",
        "Real‐time feedback systems, if overwhelmed, can miss critical anomalies or fail to adjust environmental parameters in time, leading to batch losses. Edge computing, federated learning, and hierarchical control systems are emerging as solutions, but adoption remains limited [22].",
        "Furthermore, maintaining model robustness during scale‐up (e.g., in the face of gradient heterogeneity in large bioreactors) requires extensive retraining and validation [15].",
        "AI models trained on patient‐derived stem cells or disease‐specific iPSC lines involve sensitive personal data. Compliance with data protection laws such as GDPR and HIPAA is nonnegotiable but technically challenging, especially in cross‐border collaborations [73, 74].",
        "Beyond privacy, bias in training datasets—such as overrepresentation of certain demographic groups—can propagate into quality predictions or lineage differentiation assessments, raising concerns about fairness and liability [24].",
        "Moreover, informed consent frameworks often do not yet cover the secondary AI uses of biomedical data. Addressing these gaps will be crucial to build public and regulatory trust [75].",
        "Despite technological readiness, AI adoption remains limited in clinical and industrial settings. High upfront costs for infrastructure upgrades, lack of trained personnel, and resistance to changing established protocols are major operational hurdles [23]. Regulatory bodies require clear documentation, validation, and explainability for AI‐driven decision systems under GMP. Currently, there are no universally accepted validation frameworks for AI in stem cell manufacturing. Lack of standards for model robustness, retraining frequency, and performance under adverse conditions further complicates approval pathways [76]. Bridging this gap requires joint efforts from AI researchers, biomanufacturers, and regulatory agencies to establish clear, pragmatic validation pathways [77].",
        "The integration of AI into stem cell quality monitoring has made remarkable progress but remains at a transitional stage. Addressing current challenges through targeted innovations could unlock the full potential of scalable, reproducible, and personalized regenerative therapies.",
        "This section outlines specific, feasible strategies to drive the next generation of AI‐enhanced stem cell manufacturing.",
        "Building fully autonomous stem cell biomanufacturing systems will require the integration of real‐time AI monitoring, adaptive control algorithms, and digital twin technologies. Current AI models rely heavily on labeled datasets, which limits their scalability and adaptability across diverse cultural systems. Self‐supervised learning approaches, capable of extracting meaningful representations from unlabeled data, offer a promising solution to reduce annotation bottlenecks and improve model generalizability for monitoring heterogeneous stem cell environments [78]. In parallel, embed‐ ding reinforcement learning agents into bioreactors could enable continuous optimization of critical parameters such as feeding, oxygenation, and shear stress based on real‐time sensor feedback, reducing the need for manual intervention. Digital twins—real‐time virtual simulations of stem cell cultures updated continuously with sensor and image data—can be used to predict differentiation trajectories, identify early signs of anomalies, and suggest targeted interventions to maintain optimal culture conditions [81]. Several early prototypes of autonomous systems in hematopoietic stem cell culture have already demonstrated feasibility [41]; however, scaling these frameworks to support pluripotent stem cells and lineage‐specific differentiation remains a critical next step.",
        "Data privacy and variability across institutions remain major barriers to AI model generalization. Federated learning frameworks offer a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training across multiple laboratories without the need to share raw data, thereby preserving privacy while still leveraging diverse datasets [79]. To ensure the effectiveness of these frameworks, it is essential to harmonize data collection and preprocessing protocols across participating institutions, which will help improve model convergence and robustness. Pilot federated learning networks for biomedical imaging have already demonstrated the technical feasibility of this approach [82], and extending these frameworks to stem cell culture data represents a natural and necessary progression.",
        "For clinical and GMP‐grade stem cell manufacturing, AI models must offer transparent and interpretable decision‐making processes. Techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature attribution enable models to highlight which morphological or molecular features influence quality assessments, facilitating human validation and easing the path toward regulatory review [69]. In addition, the development of standardized validation pipelines—including consistency checks across production batches, robustness testing against adversarial inputs, and correlation with clinical outcomes—will be crucial for gaining regulatory acceptance. Explainable AI will not only enhance trust among biologists and clinicians but also streamline compliance with regulatory standards.",
        "As AI‐driven stem cell manufacturing moves closer to clinical application, ethical oversight must evolve in parallel. One key area is the evolution of informed consent processes, which should explicitly account for the secondary use of data in AI model development and quality monitoring, thereby anticipating future regulatory requirements [75]. Furthermore, regular audits for demographic and procedural biases in training datasets must become a routine part of AI model quality control to ensure fairness and reliability. Global initiatives, such as the WHO's guidance on ethics and governance of AI in health, offer a foundational framework upon which more specific, domain‐tailored governance models can be built [83].",
        "AI‐driven quality monitoring tools initially developed for stem cell cultures are also highly applicable to complex three‐dimensional systems, including organoids and engineered tissues. Temporal AI models capable of predicting morphogenesis trajectories could allow for earlier detection of off‐target developments, improving the reliability of organoid production. Moreover, integrating multimodal data sources—such as imaging, transcriptomics, and metabolomics—can produce dynamic, high‐resolution fingerprints of organoid quality [80]. Scaling and refining these approaches will significantly accelerate advancements in disease modeling, high‐throughput drug screening, and personalized tissue therapies.",
        "The application of AI in stem cell quality monitoring is transforming the landscape of regenerative medicine—from static, labor‐intensive assessments to dynamic, predictive, and scalable systems. However, meaningful progress requires more than technological capability: it demands critical integration, validation, and a clear roadmap for implementation.",
        "This review provides a structured analytical framework that links CQAs in stem cell cultures to AI‐driven monitoring and control strategies. We critically evaluated key technologies—such as CNNs, generative models, predictive analytics, and explainable AI—and presented comparative benchmarks to demonstrate their practical impact. Through case studies and quantitative insights, we highlighted how AI enables early anomaly detection, improves lineage fidelity, and reduces batch variability.",
        "At the same time, we identified core barriers—including data heterogeneity, ethical constraints, and regulatory uncertainty—that currently limit widespread adoption. We proposed actionable future directions including federated learning, digital twins, self‐supervised models, and standardized validation protocols that can bridge the gap between innovation and clinical translation.",

This Review examines advances in our understanding of what constitutes an effective CAR T-cell product and approaches to improve product quality. Historically, strategies have relied on adjustments in medium composition and selection of less differentiated cell subtypes. Since 2020, the field has been shifting towards reduced-expansion protocols, no-activation protocols, and point-of-care manufacturing. These approaches have the advantage of a rapid turnaround while maintaining a less differentiated and exhausted phenotype. These efforts are leading to ultrarapid production methods and even elimination of ex vivo manipulation with the use of in vivo manufacturing approaches. In this Review, we focus on the advances needed to accelerate CAR T-cell manufacture (including near-patient methods), with an emphasis on improved therapeutic efficacy and rapid turnaround time, and simplified quality control procedures required to fully realise the clinical potential of CAR T-cell therapies. data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. and Tissue Therapeutics, Royal Free Hospital London, NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. and Tissue Therapeutics, Royal Free Hospital London, NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.

        "Fresh leukapheresis exhibits time-sensitive viability decay (24-72-hour transport window)1–3. Current CAR-T production faces a paradoxical dilemma: While up to 33% of lymphoma patients are unable to receive treatment due to leukapheresis failure or rapid disease progression4, the field still critically depends on cells sourced from these same immunocompromised patients for most cryopreservation protocols. These failure rates directly correlate with therapeutic outcomes: B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) sees 15–40% treatment failures, rising to over 50% in B-cell lymphoma5. Intensive preconditioning regimens exacerbate T-cell deterioration. Furthermore, both advancing age and altered physiological conditions contribute to a progressive decline in immune cell quantity and function6. These studies indicate that cell quality impacts cell therapy outcomes. PBMCs cryopreservation demonstrates 20-30-year immune cell preservation7. Thus early storage is critical—driving our cryopreservation optimization.",
        "Frozen PBMCs have a longer useful life and a wider application paradigm in cell therapy. However, with the continuous development of sorting technology, the selection of raw materials for cell therapy is more and more inclined to be treated directly with leukapheresis collection8,9, rather than using PBMCs. Traditional PBMC isolation via density gradient centrifugation (e.g., Ficoll) is susceptible to temperature sensitivity and dilution ratio during processing10, leading to significant cell loss, particularly of monocytes and stromal cells, which are critical for T-cell activation and immune function11,12. Direct cryopreservation of leukapheresis collections can significantly alleviate these bottlenecks, preserving cellular diversity and cell yields. Nevertheless, critical knowledge gaps persist in the systemic evaluation of cryopreserved leukapheresis for industrial applications. Most studies focus solely on T-cell function13, neglecting non-T cell components and their cryotolerance14.",
        "This study demonstrates that the integration of standardized and automated closed production technologies for cryopreserved leukapheresis, when applied as starting materials for cutting-edge CAR-T platforms, constitutes a pivotal advancement toward distributed manufacturing. Implementing these innovations into future CAR-T therapeutic frameworks will not only provide novel raw materials for personalized treatments but also drive the transition of industrialized production toward distributed models, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy and safety.",
        "A systematic search was conducted across PubMed using keywords: \" (“PBMC” OR “peripheral blood mononuclear cells”) AND (“cryopreservation” OR “freezing” OR “long-term storage”), (“leukapheresis” OR “leukopak”) AND (“cryopreservation” OR “freezing”) Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed studies (2010–2024) focusing on cryopreservation protocols, clinical outcomes, or process standardization. The search retrieved 285 studies on cryopreserved PBMCs and 64 studies on cryopreserved leukapheresis products, accounting for only 18.3% of total studies (Fig. 1A). From 2010 to 2024, annual publications on leukapheresis cryopreservation (2–8 papers) remained lower than those on PBMC cryopreservation (16–29 papers) (Fig. 1B). Notably, the surge in PBMC-related publications in 2016 coincided with the rising demand for CAR-T therapies. CiteSpace analysis of 349 publications revealed key research clusters, including “cellbanker”, “flow cytometry”, “biomonitoring”, “T cells”, and “CAR-T cells” (Fig. 1C-1D), highlighting major themes: cell banking, quality control, immune monitoring, T/B cell biology, cell expansion, and cancer therapeutics. Burst keyword analysis (Fig. 1E) demonstrated early focus on myeloid-derived suppressor cells and T cells, with later emphasis on PBMCs and whole blood, reflecting shifting research priorities. As a starting material for CAR-T products, leukapheresis offers advantages by reducing donor phlebotomy frequency and serving as a standardized, traceable raw material for off-the-shelf therapies. However, research on cryopreserved leukapheresis remains inadequate, lacking standardized protocols and post-thaw functional validation. Systematic evaluation of leukapheresis cryopreservation should address subpopulation stability, functionality, and integration with automated platforms to ensure reproducibility.",

        "The figure (Fig. 2) outlines the comprehensive process of developing a standardized cryopreservation protocol for leukapheresis products, followed by a comparability study, and finally, the different manufacturing processes for CAR-T cells. Initially, we embarked on developing the leukapheresis cryopreservation process to establish a standardized protocol for cryopreserved leukapheresis products. The primary objective of cryopreserved leukapheresis is to preserve leukocyte components, with current research focusing on optimizing T-cell quality post-thaw. While leukocyte cryopreservation technology is relatively mature, the critical challenge lies in mitigating the impact of non-target cellular impurities (e.g., residual red blood cells, platelets) in leukapheresis products on post-thaw T-cell viability, recovery, and subsequent CAR-T product quality. To address this, a centrifugation-based strategy was systematically implemented to remove non-cellular impurities. Furthermore, clinical-grade cryoprotectant CS10 (10% DMSO) was selected to minimize erythrocyte volume interference with DMSO concentration, ensuring consistent cryoprotection efficacy.",

The median cell concentration decreased progressively from 5.09–9.71 × 107 cells/ml at initial leukapheresis to 4.06–5.12 × 107 cells/ml pre-cryopreservation and further to 3.49–4.67 × 107 cells/ml post-cryopreservation. Viability remained high throughout, with initial values of 99.2–99.5%, declining slightly to 94.0–96.15% pre-cryopreservation and 90.9–97.0% post-thaw. The CD3 + T lymphocyte proportion showed minimal variation, ranging from 43.82 to 56.31% initially to 41.19–56.45% pre-cryopreservation and 42.01–51.21% post-thaw, indicating no significant loss of T cells during processing. Formulation efficiency was optimized using a closed-system automated platform, reducing processing times to 43–108 min. Cryopreservation parameters included a target cell concentration of ~ 5 × 107 cells/ml to accommodate high-density requirements. Post-thaw viability (90.9–97.0%) and CD3 + purity (42.01–51.21%) confirmed effective cryoprotection and minimal cellular damage. Initial leukapheresis specifications included a leukocyte volume of ~ 1 ml per 1 × 109 cells, hematocrit levels of 5–10%, and residual volume retention (3 ml per 1 × 109 cells) to ensure ≥ 7.5% DMSO concentration in the cryomedium.

        "Our analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in the proportion of major immune cells, specifically lymphocytes, between fresh and cryopreserved leukapheresis products compared to cryopreserved PBMCs. Fresh and cryopreserved leukapheresis products exhibited a higher percentage of lymphocytes (Fresh-LEUK: 68.68 ± 1.78%, Cryo-LEUK: 66.59 ± 2.64%) compared to cryopreserved PBMCs (Cryo-PBMC: 52.20 ± 9.29%, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the proportions of neutrophils and monocytes were similar across all groups, with no statistically significant differences observed.",
        "We further compared three key subsets within the lymphocyte population, including T, B, and NK cells. Our results indicated that there were no significant differences in the proportions of these subsets between the groups (Fig. 3C). The higher lymphocyte count in cryopreserved leukapheresis products was primarily attributed to an increased proportion of T cells, which may be advantageous for T cell-based therapies such as CAR-T. As a critical raw material for CAR-T manufacturing, we investigated the phenotypic and functional characteristics of T cells. The ratios of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, as well as their functional subsets (Tn, TCM, TEM, and Teff), were comparable between thawed leukapheresis products and PBMCs (Fig. 3D and 3E). This suggests that the freezing process did not significantly alter the T cell composition or functional characteristics.",
        "We compared the viability of cells at various stages of CAR-T manufacturing. Post-thaw recovery and T cell sorting resulted in lower viability for both cryopreserved leukapheresis products and PBMCs compared to fresh samples. Specifically, the viability of cryopreserved samples was significantly lower than fresh samples at the pre-separation stage (Fresh-LEUK: 99.04 ± 0.30% vs. Cryo-LEUK: 90.99 ± 0.86%, p < 0.0001; Fresh-LEUK: 99.04 ± 0.30% vs. Cryo-PBMC: 93.47 ± 1.95%, p < 0.01) and post-separation stage (Fresh-LEUK: 98.78 ± 0.17% vs. Cryo-LEUK: 94.06 ± 0.87%, p < 0.001; Fresh-LEUK: 98.78 ± 0.17% vs. Cryo-PBMC: 93.97 ± 1.42%, p < 0.01). However, before transduction, the viability of cryopreserved leukapheresis products was restored to levels comparable to fresh samples (Fresh-LEUK: 93.34 ± 0.78% vs. Cryo-LEUK: 93.88 ± 0.56%, p > 0.05; Fresh-LEUK: 93.34 ± 0.78% vs. Cryo-PBMC: 90.70 ± 1.01%, p > 0.05) (Fig. 3F).",
        "We then focused on the recovery of cryopreserved leukapheresis products versus cryopreserved PBMCs after thawing. No statistically significant difference was observed in the recovery rates between the two groups (Fig. 3G). However, starting with an equivalent amount of leukapheresis material, cryopreserved leukapheresis products significantly preserved a greater number of leukocytes (97.5% ± 4.4%) compared to cryopreserved PBMCs (70.0% ± 6.2%, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3H). Consequently, this led to a higher yield of T cells in cryopreserved leukapheresis products (34.2% ± 8.6%) compared to cryopreserved PBMCs (21.7% ± 8.6%, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3I).",
        "To investigate the feasibility of using cryopreserved leukapheresis as the initial raw material for conventional CAR-T manufacturing with the non-viral vector Piggy Bac transposon system, we compared the cell viability during the culture process (Fig. 4A) and continuous growth (Fig. 4B), finding no statistical difference between cryopreserved and fresh leukapheresis. Simultaneously, we explored the effects of cryopreserved and fresh leukapheresis on cell phenotype, cytotoxicity, and exhausted phenotype during CAR-T manufacturing. The study found no statistical difference in the proportions of Tn, TCM, TEM, and Teff between cryopreserved and fresh raw materials (Fig. 4C). For CAR-T, cryopreserved leukapheresis had no statistical difference from fresh one (Fig. 4C). Through the analysis of exhaustion functional markers (PD1+, LAG3+, and TIM3+) of CD3 + T cells on Day 9, we found no statistical difference between cryopreserved and fresh leukapheresis either (Fig. 4D). Finally, we conducted an assay of cellular cytotoxicity with effector: target (E: T) ratios of 2:1, 4:1, and found no statistical difference in the cytotoxicity effect between the two materials (Fig. 4E). Overall, cryopreserved leukapheresis is comparable to fresh one as the raw material for producing non-viral vector CAR-T.",

        "To explore the extensive applicability of cryopreserved leukapheresis, apart from manufacturing CAR-T with non-viral vectors, we also used classical lentiviral vectors for CAR-T manufacturing.

        "To assess functional viability, sorted T cells from both sources were cultured for 9 days. Cell viability exceeded 85% in all cases (Fig. 5C), and no differences in total T cell expansion were detected (Fig. 5D), indicating equivalent proliferative capacity. For NK/NKT cell evaluation, we employed a cytokine-based kit for NK cell expansion. However, this method concurrently amplified both NK and NKT cells, necessitating subsequent phenotypic analysis to distinguish these populations. Despite this co-expansion, viability (Fig. 5E) and total cellular expansion (Fig. 5F) during culture showed no significant divergence between cryopreserved leukapheresis and PBMCs. Further analysis of NK/NKT-specific expansion (Fig. 5G) and their proportional representation in culture up to Day 11 (Fig. 5H) also revealed comparable outcomes between the two cell sources.",
        "These findings align with prior studies demonstrating that cryopreserved PBMCs and leukapheresis products retain functional equivalence in CAR-T manufacturing and immune cell applications, with no adverse impact on viability, expansion, or therapeutic efficacy. The observed co-amplification of NK and NKT cells highlights the importance of method-specific validation, as cytokine-driven protocols may inadvertently activate overlapping subsets. Overall, our data support the interchangeable use of cryopreserved leukapheresis and PBMCs for scalable cell therapy production.",
        "Traditional CAR-T manufacturing uses a linear “patient-leukapheresis-immediate processing” workflow, creating geographically constrained supply chains vulnerable to cellular viability loss. Mature cryopreserved leukapheresis technology enhances flexibility by enabling centralized cryostorage combined with off-site manufacturing. Our study shows thawed products maintain sufficient viable cells (90% recovery rate, 90–99% T-cell purity) for CAR-T production. This centralized model involves cryopreserving patient materials for shipment to core facilities, genetic modification, and redistribution to clinics—distributing costs and accommodating demand fluctuations15. It facilitates equitable access for remote patients while mitigating disease progression risks associated with manufacturing delays16.",
        "To our knowledge, this study demonstrates that cryopreserved leukapheresis products are compatible with lentiviral transduction, transposon-based systems, and rapid CAR-T manufacturing platforms, underscoring their adaptability for advancing next-generation immunotherapies. The long-term dynamics post-cryopreservation—such as in vivo expansion kinetics and the dynamics of memory subset proportions—require further elucidation through prospective clinical trials. Nevertheless, emerging clinical evidence supports the functional integrity of CAR-T products from frozen immune cells. In a multi-center trial of 115 patients receiving PBMC-derived CAR-T therapy, comparable objective response rates were observed between fresh (72%) and cryopreserved (80%) cohorts, with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.727)17. This suggests that cryopreservation protocols may preserve therapeutic efficacy. Cryopreserved leukapheresis advantages extend beyond supply chain optimization to broader clinical applications through compatibility with diverse CAR-T platforms. Studies have validated adaptability to lentiviral transduction1 (e.g., Kymriah), transposon systems (e.g., Sleeping Beauty), and non-viral gene-editing platforms (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9)18. Cryopreserved cells show comparable therapeutic efficacy to fresh cells—demonstrated in B-cell leukemia trials with similar in vivo expansion, persistence, toxicity profiles, and disease response rates to fresh cells19. Our data reveal no significant differences in lentiviral transduction efficiency between cryopreserved leukapheresis-derived and PBMC-derived T cells. Cryopreserved umbilical cord blood-derived T cells displayed tumor-killing activity equivalent to autologous cells in preclinical models20, supporting universal CAR-T development. These findings establish the cross-platform applicability, overcoming historical limitations of single-process studies.",
        "Ultra-short cycle CAR-T manufacturing (< 3 days), exemplified by platforms like Ultra CAR-T21represents an emerging industry trend. Cryopreserved leukapheresis exhibits particular synergy with such technologies. Conventional ex vivo expansion (7–14 days22 risks cryopreservation-induced metabolic and phenotypic T-cell alterations, whereas fast processes mitigate these effects by minimizing culture duration (e.g., completing transduction/activation within 72 h)23. Integration of non-viral technologies with automated closed systems (e.g., CliniMACS Prodigy) enables sub-3-day production cycles while leveraging cryopreserved leukapheresis samples for on-demand manufacturing. This “Freeze-and-Speed” strategy not only reduces cellular exhaustion risks through rapid thaw-to-manufacture workflows24 but also enhances batch consistency by minimizing manual handling, thereby laying the groundwork for scalable production.",
        "Standardized protocols for cryopreserved leukapheresis (e.g., automated apheresis devices and GMP-compliant cryopreservation) provide technical foundations for large-scale biobanking and mitigate patient-specific limitations. Critically, clinical heterogeneity is addressed through: (1) Industrial validation: Utilizing cryopreserved leukapheresis for CAR-T manufacturing achieves 82.2% release success rate across production batches for patient infusion25. The Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) manufacturing protocol accepts cells cryopreserved within 18 months under quality oversight26; (2) Proactive banking at diagnosis: In DLBCL patients, leukapheresis prior to ASCT therapy yielded significantly increased CD4+/CD8 + ratios (p = 0.04) and reduced absolute counts of CD8 + terminally differentiated T cells (p = 0.05)27, preserving T-cell fitness. This strategy enables cross-population applicability (early/late-stage patients and healthy donors), where healthy donor banking serves future universal CAR-T development. Mechanistic optimization (e.g., cryoprotectant adjustments for memory Treg subsets28) will advance personalized strategies, steering CAR-T therapy from a “one-size-fits-all” toward precision medicine.",
        "Cryopreserved leukapheresis has emerged as a cornerstone for CAR-T therapy scalability and accessibility by resolving supply chain bottlenecks, enabling cross-platform compatibility, synergizing with fast processes, and facilitating biobanking. Future research must address cryopreservation’s epigenetic impacts on immune cells and leverage artificial intelligence to optimize the entire cryopreservation-manufacturing pipeline, ultimately realizing the vision of “one leukapheresis, multiple therapies.”",
        "In conclusion, there are no significant differences in the cell profiles (including differential of leukocyte, lymphocyte subset, and T cell subpopulation, as well as in the culture potency of T-cells and non-T-cells, such as NK and NKT cells, between cryopreserved leukapheresis and PBMCs. However, obtaining T cells from cryopreserved leukapheresis simplifies the process, reduces cell loss, and yields more sorted T cells. The main impact of cryopreserved leukapheresis is lower cell viability after recovery and sorting compared to fresh. Meanwhile, the cell profiles have no significant difference between fresh and cryopreserved leukapheresis. Cryopreserved leukapheresis was used to manufacture CAR-T using different processes with results comparable to fresh leukapheresis.",

    "title": "Advancing Parkinson's disease treatment: cell replacement therapy with neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells. of dopamine neurons from the substantia nigra. There are currently no treatments that can slow or reverse the neurodegeneration. To restore the lost neurons, international groups have initiated clinical trials using human embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to derive dopamine neuron precursors that are used as transplants to replace the lost neurons. Proof-of-principle experiments in the 1980s and 1990s showed that grafts of fetal ventral mesencephalon, which contains the precursors of the substantial nigra, could, under rare circumstances, reverse symptoms of the disease. Improvements in PSC technology and genomics have inspired researchers to design clinical trials using PSC-derived dopamine neuron precursors as cell replacement therapy for PD. We focus here on 4 such first-in-human clinical trials that have begun in the US, Europe, and Japan. We provide an overview of the sources of PSCs and the methods used to generate cells for transplantation. We discuss pros and cons of strategies for allogeneic, immune-matched, and autologous approaches and novel methods for overcoming rejection by the immune system. We consider challenges for safety and efficacy of the cells for durable engraftment, focusing on the genomics-based quality control methods to assure that the cells will not become cancerous. Finally, since clinical trials like these have never been undertaken before, we comment on the value of cooperation among rivals to contribute to advancements that will finally provide relief for the millions suffering from the symptoms of PD.

        "The natural process of growing older involves a gradual deterioration of bodily functions, which significantly increases an organism’s vulnerability to various age-related illnesses, particularly disorders affecting the nervous system. Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among others, have a substantial impact on an individual’s quality of life and pose a significant burden on society [1]. These neurodegenerative diseases share common underlying mechanisms, including protein aggregation, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction, all of which contribute to neuronal loss [2]. Cellular senescence plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative disorders and is considered a potential underlying cause. Senescent cells contribute to the onset and advancement of these diseases through various mechanisms [3]. As a key indicator of aging, cellular senescence is defined by permanent cell cycle arrest and a reduction in cellular functions [4]. This process is not limited to somatic cells, but also encompasses stem cells, including neural stem cells (NSCs). When these cells age, their regenerative capacity -essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and repair- declines [5].",
        "In regenerative medicine, there are three major therapeutic categories known collectively as the “R3” paradigm [6, 7]: (1) Rejuvenation—restoring the functional capacity of existing cells or reversing cellular aging processes; (2) Regeneration—stimulating repair or regrowth of tissues using stem cells or host repair mechanisms; and (3) Replacement—directly substituting lost or damaged cells with functional ones.",
        "The objective of this review is twofold: (1) to critically analyze the processes of cellular senescence that contribute to neurodegenerative disorders, and (2) to discuss cell-based strategies in the R3 context. In recent years, remarkable advancements have been made in the field of regenerative medicine. By integrating R3 concepts, we distinguish how certain approaches focus on rejuvenation, some on regeneration, and others on outright replacement. These strategies aim to counteract the effects of aging and mitigate neurodegeneration by specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms of aging, such as cellular senescence.",
        "This review comprehensively examines the mechanisms of cellular senescence and explores potential R3 strategies. Specifically, it summarizes the role of cellular senescence in neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its contributions to disease onset, progression acceleration, and the hindrance of traditional treatment effectiveness. Additionally, various cell-based strategies, such as stem cell therapy, direct lineage reprogramming, and partial reprogramming, are explored. Their potential benefits and challenges in treating neurodegenerative diseases are evaluated, with a focus on how these strategies may target senescent cells to restore functionality (rejuvenation), enhance endogenous repair (regeneration), or replace lost neurons (replacement). By delving into these underlying mechanisms and investigating innovative therapeutic approaches, we aim to pave the way for more effective treatments that can enhance patients’ quality of life and potentially delay or even reverse the aging process.",
        "In neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, PD, and ALS, various cell types within the brain undergo aging-related changes that play a crucial role in initiating and driving disease progression. Neurons, glial cells (including microglia and astrocytes), and NSCs all exhibit senescence-like phenotypes during both physiological aging and neurodegeneration [8]. These changes contribute to the complex pathogenesis of these disorders (Fig. 1).",
        "Fig. 1Impact of cellular senescence and inflammation on neurodegeneration. This figure depicts the progression of neurodegenerative diseases driven by cellular senescence. Key processes include the activation of senescent markers (p65, p53, p16, p21) in astrocytes, which release senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors (TNFα, iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23) that intensify neuroinflammation. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown leads to neutrophil and leukocyte infiltration, further contributing to inflammation. Microglia activation and the presence of senescent oligodendrocytes result in additional neuronal damage, characterized by Aβ plaque deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and myelin degradation, all of which are hallmarks of neurodegeneration",

        "Neurons, which have limited regenerative capacity, are highly susceptible to aging-related damage. Interestingly, although neurons were traditionally regarded as exempt from senescence due to their post-mitotic nature, recent evidence shows that they can in fact enter senescence in response to multiple stressors such as oxidative stress and DNA damage [9, 10]. For instance, the loss of SATB1, a DNA binding protein associated with PD, has been shown to activate a cellular senescence transcriptional program in dopaminergic neurons, suggesting neuronal senescence as a contributing factor to PD pathology [11]. Senescent neuronal cells accumulate with age and exhibit characteristics such as cell cycle arrest, pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype, and altered proteostasis, which can exacerbate neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, leading to cognitive decline and neuronal degeneration [12, 13]. This neuronal senescence phenomenon has led to increased interest in senolytic therapies specifically targeting neurons. Such therapies aim to selectively eliminate senescent neurons or modulate their harmful effects on neuronal function [14, 15]. Preliminary studies have shown promising results, with senolytic treatments blocking disease progression in mouse models of tau - mediated neurodegeneration by acting on affected neurons and improving outcomes in SARS-CoV-2-induced neuropathology involving neuronal damage [14, 15]. Nonetheless, further research is needed to thoroughly investigate the occurrence of neuronal senescence and evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of senolytic treatments in neurodegenerative diseases [16].",
        "Glia cells, particularly microglia and astrocytes, are crucial components of the central nervous system (CNS) that significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Microglia, the primary immune cells of the CNS, undergo age-related and senescence-driven changes that profoundly impact the onset and progression of these disorders [16]. In PD, for example, reactive microglia have been observed in the substantia nigra and striatum, accompanied by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [17]. These changes in microglial function can lead to chronic neuroinflammation, exacerbating neuronal damage and accelerating disease progression.",
        "Astrocytes, once considered merely supportive cells, are now recognized as active participants in various complex CNS functions. Like microglia, astrocytes also experience age-related changes that can influence the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases [17]. These changes may include alterations in astrocyte morphology, reactivity, and their ability to provide metabolic support to neurons. Astrocytes are also integral to maintaining the integrity and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), forming part of the neurovascular unit along with brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs), pericytes, and neurons [18]. Senescent astrocytes significantly contribute to neurodegenerative processes and linked to cognitive decline [19, 20]. The accumulation of senescent astrocytes in the aging brain, characterized by lamin-B1 reduction and nuclear deformations, may lead to astrocyte dysfunctions and subsequent neurodegeneration [21]. Their ability to support neuronal survival, clear neurotransmitters, and remove toxic protein aggregates, which are essential for maintaining a healthy CNS environment, is reduced [19]. Interestingly, senescent astrocytes display a unique transcriptome distinct from reactive astrocytes, with dysregulated pathways and downregulation of brain-expressed genes involved in neuronal development and differentiation [22, 23]. Contradictory to their normal protective role, senescent astrocytes exhibit impaired astrocytic responses to injury and decreased expression of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation [22]. Targeting senescent astrocytes and their associated pathways presents a promising approach for developing therapies to counter age-related neurodegeneration and improve brain health [24, 25].",
        "The accumulation of senescent cells in the brain, including oligodendrocytes, contributes to age-related pathologies and neurodegeneration [9]. Oligodendrocytes, specialized glial cells in the CNS, are crucial for maintaining neuronal health and function, not just for myelination. Recent evidence shows that oligodendrocyte dysfunction, such as senescence, significantly contributes to neurodegenerative processes. Senescent oligodendrocytes can produce SASPs, fostering chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, which lead to progressive CNS demyelination, microglial inflammation, and further neurodegeneration [26]. Importantly, the finding that deletion of the p21CIP1 pathway ameliorated the disease, while blocking microglial inflammation did not prevent neurodegeneration in demyelinating disorders suggests that senescence, particularly of oligodendrocytes, is a key factor in driving neurodegeneration. This contradicts the traditional view that microglial inflammation is the sole primary driver and highlights the significance of directly targeting senescent oligodendrocytes as potential therapeutic targets [26].",
        "Senescent pericytes also play a significant role in neurodegenerative processes, contributing to brain aging and neurological disorders. Pericytes, located within the neurovascular unit, are crucial for maintaining BBB integrity, regulating cerebral blood flow, and supporting overall brain health [27, 28]. As pericytes become senescent, they exhibit characteristic features such as increased β-galactosidase activity, cell cycle arrest, and enhanced expression of SASP factors [29]. These changes can lead to BBB dysfunction, reduced cerebral blood flow, and impaired clearance of toxic cellular by-products [30]. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of pericyte senescence and its impact on the neurovascular unit is essential for developing targeted therapies to combat neurodegenerative disorders and enhance brain health during aging.",
        "NSCs are pivotal for brain function and maintenance, yet their senescence is closely linked to neurodegenerative processes. Amyloid-β (Aβ), a pathogenic protein associated with AD, has been shown to accelerate cellular senescence in human NSCs [31]. This process involves enhanced expression of senescence-related genes, increased senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, and activation of the DNA damage response [31]. Interestingly, reprogramming of human fibroblasts into induced NSCs (iNSCs) using miR-302a has demonstrated promising results in combating cellular aging and improving cognitive performance in AD models [32]. These miR-302a-hiNSCs showed delayed aging, increased resistance to oxidative stress, and improved cognitive function when implanted into senescence-accelerated mice [32]. This contradicts the notion that all NSCs are susceptible to senescence and suggests that certain reprogramming techniques may offer therapeutic potential.",
        "Senescent endothelial cells significantly influence neurodegenerative processes by contributing to age-related vascular and neurological disorders. The accumulation of these cells can lead to endothelial dysfunction, which is associated with conditions such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ischemic injury [33]. Senescent endothelial cells display a distinct SASP, characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and proteases that disrupt the local microenvironment. Unlike in normal, healthy endothelial cells, the SASP in senescent ones initiates a cascade of events that can lead to tissue dysfunction and further exacerbate the aging process at the local level. This unique secretory behavior of senescent endothelial cells thus becomes a crucial focus when studying the mechanisms underlying age-related pathologies and potential therapeutic interventions [34]. For example, exposure to neurotoxic amyloid β (Aβ1–42) oligomers can induce a senescence phenotype in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) [35]. This finding suggests a direct link between endothelial cell senescence and neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Furthermore, senescent endothelial cells show alterations in morphological and nanomechanical properties, including increased membrane stiffness and changes in adhesion properties, which may contribute to cerebrovascular dysfunction [35].",
        "Cellular senescence poses significant challenges to traditional treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. It involves multiple aspects that complicate the treatment process.",
        "The accumulation of senescent cells, their resistance to apoptosis, and the SASP are major issues. The SASP exacerbates neurodegeneration by creating a pro-inflammatory milieu that affects neighboring healthy cells. This not only leads to chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction but also interferes with treatment efficacy. Senescent cells may respond differently to medications, impair neurogenesis, disrupt the BBB, and exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, senescence-associated epigenetic changes, cellular heterogeneity in affected brain regions, and reduced regenerative capacity of NSCs further compound the challenges in targeted treatment.",
        "In terms of drug delivery and uptake, cellular senescence causes changes in membrane permeability and the function of transport proteins. These cells have reduced membrane permeability, affecting drug uptake and efficacy. Altered endocytic activity in these cells, as seen in the blockage of clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis in senescent human diploid fibroblasts, impacts their ability to internalize drugs [36]. However, this reduced permeability can also be exploited for targeted drug delivery. Muñoz-Espín et al. describes an innovative approach that takes advantage of the high lysosomal β-galactosidase activity in senescent cells to design a drug delivery system using galacto-oligosaccharides [37]. This method allows for preferential release of encapsulated drugs within senescent cells, improving efficacy and reducing side effects in non-senescent cells [37]. Additionally, changes in transport proteins can lead to altered drug distribution within the cell, resulting in suboptimal drug concentrations at the target sites [38]. Studies have shown that replicative senescence in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) leads to changes in the expression of various transporters. Notably, the mRNA level of organic cation transporter 2 decreased rapidly with increasing passage numbers, indicating a significant impact of senescence on transporter expression [39]. Furthermore, the uptake of fluorescent cationic substrates was reduced in SA-β-gal-positive RPTECs compared to SA-β-gal-negative cells, suggesting altered transporter function in senescent cells [39]. Besides, the regulation of drug transporter expression and activity can occur at various levels, including transcription, mRNA stability, translation, and post-translational modification, which may be influenced by the senescence process [40].",
        "Regarding drug-target interaction, the SASP can modify the expression or function of target proteins, interfere with intended drug-target interactions, and contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction, potentially reducing the effectiveness of conventional treatments. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released as part of the SASP can alter signaling pathways, gene expression programs, and even cause conformational changes in drug targets like receptors or enzymes, making it difficult for drugs to bind effectively (41,42, 43). Traditional treatment approaches for neurodegenerative diseases have limitations. These treatments often focus on alleviating symptoms or targeting specific aspects of the disease mechanism rather than addressing cellular senescence, the root cause. For instance, neurotransmitter-enhancing drugs for AD patients only provide symptomatic relief without tackling neuronal senescence issues [3, 44].",
        "Disease heterogeneity is another challenge. Neurodegenerative diseases are highly heterogeneous in affected cell types and underlying molecular mechanisms, and cellular senescence exacerbates this. Different cell types in the brain, such as glial cells, endothelial cells, neural stem cells, and neurons, can exhibit various senescence-like phenotypes and respond differently to treatments and interventions [8]. This heterogeneity is further complicated by the fact that senescent cells may respond differently to genetic and pharmacological interventions, known as senolytics or senomorphics [45]. Recent advancements, such as the machine learning program SenCID, have enabled the identification of six major senescence identities (SIDs) with different baselines, stemness, gene functions, and responses to senolytics [46]. This improved understanding of senescent cell heterogeneity may contribute to the effective treatments.",
        "There is a lack of long-term efficacy in traditional treatments. Many traditional therapies, like those for ALS, have limited long-term benefits. For example, Riluzole, approved in the 1990s, remains one of the few FDA-approved treatments for ALS, offering only modest survival benefits. More recently, edaravone has been approved, but the search for effective therapies targeting disease progression is still desperately needed [47]. This lack of long-term efficacy highlights the need for more innovative treatment strategies that can address the underlying causes of cellular senescence and disease progression.",
        "In this section, we discuss how “R3” approaches (Rejuvenation, Regeneration, and Replacement) can be applied to mitigate cellular senescence and aid in treating neurodegenerative disorders [48–50]. Specifically, we highlight stem cell therapy and cellular reprogramming (direct lineage reprogramming and partial reprogramming) as representative R3 modalities. These strategies aim to mitigate the effects of cellular senescence by (1) rejuvenating existing cells to restore youthful function, (2) regenerating neural tissues through stimulating or transplanting stem cells, or (3) replacing entirely lost neuronal populations with new, functional cells (Fig. 2).",
        "Fig. 2Overview of cell-based strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases. This diagram summarizes cell-based strategies to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Stem cells, including pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and NSCs, may rejuvenate existing cells and regenerate or replace damaged ones by serving as sources for generating neural cell types like neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Non-neuronal cells can also be directly reprogrammed into neurons, bypassing the stem cell stage. Additionally, aged neural cells undergo transient reprogramming to a stem-like state, promoting rejuvenation and potentially reversing age-related damage. These methods aim to produce functional neural cells that could replace or repair damaged cells in neurodegenerative conditions, helping to restore brain function and slow disease progression",

These methods aim to produce functional neural cells that could replace or repair damaged cells in neurodegenerative conditions, helping to restore brain function and slow disease progression",
        "Stem cells are characterized by two key features: self-renewal, which allows them to divide repeatedly; potency, which enables them to differentiate into various specialized cell types 5152, 53. Based on these properties, stem cells are categorized into totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, or unipotent [51, 54]. Most mature human cells are highly differentiated, unable to divide, and are known as “post-mitotic cells” [55]. When these differentiated post-mitotic cells become senescent or die due to natural aging, injury, or disease, their regeneration depends on the activation of local stem cells, which replenishes the tissue with younger, healthy cells [56]. However, in the aging brain or neurodegenerative conditions, local stem cells often lose their regenerative potential [57]. Consequently, stem cell therapy has emerged as a promising R3 approach for treating neurodegenerative conditions [58–61], by using stem cells or stem cell-derived neurons/NSCs to repair or replace damaged and senescent neurons, thereby supporting neural function, regeneration, and rejuvenation (Table 1).",
        "PSCs are a type of stem cell capable of differentiating into any cell type in the body, making them highly valuable for therapeutic applications. PSCs can be derived from various sources, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [62] and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)63, 64 65, 66. ESCs originate from the inner cell mass of blastocysts but raise ethical concerns due to embryos destruction [62]. iPSCs are generated by reprogramming adult somatic cells (e.g., skin fibroblasts) through transcription factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC) [63, 64] or chemical compounds [65, 66] that reset the cells’ developmental clock, sharing many ESC-like properties while avoiding ethical issues. They allow for patient-specific therapies, as they can be created from the patient’s own cells, reducing the risk of immune rejection.",
        "Efficient differentiation from PSCs into neurons is critical for stem cell replacement therapy against neurodegenerative diseases. In this process, PSCs are induced into neuronal progenitors and further specified into specific neuronal subtypes using factors like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and others, tailored to produce dopaminergic (DA) neurons for PD treatment [67–69], cholinergic neurons for AD treatment [70, 71], or motor neurons for ALS treatment [72, 73].",
        "PSC-based therapies can function within the replacement dimension of the R3 paradigm by transplanting PSC-derived specialized neurons that restore lost neural functions and counteract disease progression [74]. In some cases, they may also promote rejuvenation or regeneration via paracrine signaling and local microenvironment modulation.",
        "In 2011 and 2017, pre-clinical studies established proof of concept for dopamine (DA) neurons derived from human ESCs (hESCs) and human induced PSCs (hiPSCs) [75, 76]. Later then, more pre-clinical studies reported that PSC-based therapy can contribute to the treatment of PD [77–85]. In 2018, a clinical trial commenced involving the surgical transplantation of allogeneic hiPSC-derived DAergic neuron precursors into the putamen of individuals with PD [86, 87]. In 2020, a study documented the clinical implantation of patient-derived midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) progenitor cells, differentiated in vitro from autologous iPSCs, in a patient with idiopathic PD [88]. Ongoing clinical trials involving PSCs for PD have shown promise in terms of safety and efficacy [84, 85, 89, 90].",
        "Recent animal model studies have shown potential for PSC-based therapies to reduce pathology and enhance cognitive function [91–95]. Transplanting NSCs derived from mouse adult brains or PSCs into AD rodent models led to the generation of cholinergic neurons, increased synaptic strength, and improved memory performance [96, 97]. Additionally, hiPSC-derived NPCs and cholinergic neurons successfully survived and differentiated into cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the host brain, leading to improved spatial memory [98–100].",
        "Although iPCS is increasingly used in ALS research, the studies published so far have mainly focused on iPSC-based ALS cellular models for disease mechanisms or drug screening [101–103]. Some studies utilizing iPSC-derived NSC transplants in ALS mouse models have demonstrated positive therapeutic effects, including extended lifespan, enhanced neuromuscular function, and neuroprotection [104–108].",
        "Despite the promise, PSC-based therapies face hurdles in aging-related contexts. One significant concern is that aberrant DNA methylation patterns and histone modifications, which may be exacerbated by senescent cellular environments, can lead to improper differentiation of PSCs into desired neuronal subtypes or reduce the functionality of the resulting cells [109]. Furthermore, tumorigenicity remains a critical risk, as PSCs can form teratomas if not carefully monitored. Advanced imaging techniques and biomarkers are being developed to detect early signs of teratoma formation, but the risk persists during pre-clinical and clinical trials [110]. Immune rejection is another hurdle, as PSCs may elicit an immune response. Researchers are exploring modifications to the epigenetic and genetic profiles of PSCs during reprogramming to reduce this risk [111, 112]. Moreover, functional integration into existing neural networks is challenging in an aged or degenerating brain. Studies suggest that applying specific electrical fields can enhance synapse formation between transplanted neurons and native cells [113, 114], but achieving consistent and effective integration remains a challenge within the context of neurodegenerative diseases.",
        "MSCs are multipotent stromal cells derived from various tissues, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord blood [115], and more recently, dental pulp. Bone marrow is the original and most extensively studied source [116], known for its well-characterized MSCs. Adipose tissue provides a more accessible and abundant source [117], with less invasive extraction procedures compared to bone marrow. The umbilical cord is a non-invasive source that yields MSCs with high proliferative capacity and immunomodulatory properties [118], while the placenta and amniotic fluid are rich in MSCs and offer potent regenerative properties in an ethically favorable context [119]. Dental pulp-derived MSCs have shown unique properties and promising results in pre-clinical studies for neurodegenerative diseases [120], demonstrating enhanced neuroprotective and regenerative capabilities compared to MSCs from traditional sources.",
        "MSCs have the capacity to differentiate into a variety of cell types such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and even neurons [121]. They show potential for mitigating senescence and promoting rejuvenation through the secretion of anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic factors, as well as exosomes [122–125]. Recent studies have underscored MSCs’ potential to enhance cognitive function and neuronal health in age-related neurodegenerative diseases [126, 127].",
        "In AD models, MSCs have demonstrated the ability to reduce amyloid-beta plaques, accompanied by improvements in cognitive functions, as observed in pre-clinical studies [128–132]. A Phase I clinical trial led by Kim et al. involved nine patients with mild-to-moderate AD, resulting in stabilization of cognitive decline and enhancement of cognitive function [129, 133, 134].",
        "In the context of PD, MSCs have been utilized to protect and preserve DA neurons. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that MSC transplantation can enhance motor function [135], attributed to their neuroprotective properties and their potential to differentiate into neuron-like cells that can assimilate into existing neural pathways [136]. Moreover, a 2021 Phase I clinical trial studied intravenous infusion of umbilical cord MSCs (UC-MSCs) for PD treatment [137].",
        "MSC therapy may also help mitigate inflammation and demyelination in ALS and MS [138, 139]. In ALS animal models, MSCs have decreased inflammation and promoted remyelination, improving neurological function [140, 141]. These promising animal study results have catalyzed clinical trials assessing MSC therapy’s effects in ALS patients, with early studies indicating safety and therapeutic benefits, including symptom stabilization and improvements in motor abilities and quality of life [142–145].",
        "Despite their promise in aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, several challenges remain. In an aging body, ensuring the long-term safety and consistent efficacy of MSC therapies is of utmost importance. For instance, as cells age, there may be an increased risk of abnormal cellular behaviors, and potential risks such as tumor formation associated with MSC therapies must be carefully addressed [146, 147]. Developing standardized protocols for the isolation, expansion, and administration of MSCs is highly necessary in the context of aging. The aging process can affect the characteristics of MSCs, making it essential to have consistent procedures to ensure reproducibility and efficacy across studies [148, 149]. Moreover, extensive clinical trials designed to meet regulatory standards are needed before MSC-based therapies gain wide clinical acceptance, particularly in complex aging condition like neurodegeneration.",
        "NSCs has gained significant attention over the past few decades as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative disease [150]. They are multipotent cells capable of differentiating into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. NSCs can be obtained for therapeutic purposes through several methods: isolation from fetal or adult brain tissue where NSCs naturally reside [151], differentiation from PSC [152], and direct reprogramming of somatic cells into NSCs by introducing specific TFs or chemical compounds [153].",
        "In the R3 paradigm, NSC-based therapy primarily fosters regeneration and replacement by generating new neurons and glial cells, which helps rejuvenate the brain. Specifically, NSCs replace aged or damaged cells, promote a healthy neural environment, and enhance neurogenesis to counteract the decline linked with aging and neurodegeneration [154–157]. Pre-clinical studies of NSCs-based therapy in animal models have shown promising results, with NSCs promoting neural repair, reducing inflammation, and improving function in conditions like ALS, PD and AD [150].",
        "In mouse models of ALS, implanted human NSCs have been effective in delaying disease onset and progression and increasing survival by producing neurotrophic factors and reducing neural inflammation [158–160]. The FDA approved the first Phase I clinical trial in 2009 for transplanting human spinal cord-derived NSCs into ALS patients, followed by a Phase II trial [161–163]. These trials, which involved transplanting NSCs into the spinal cords of 6 and 18 ALS patients, respectively, did not show serious adverse reactions or accelerated disease progression [164, 165]. Clinical trials have also explored allogeneic NSC transplantation in patients with progressive MS, demonstrating that the procedure is well-tolerated, feasible, and safe, and it helped slow disease progression [162, 166, 167]. However, other trials have noted potential side effects, such as acute neurological deterioration and central pain syndrome [168].",
        "Recent studies reveal NSC secretions can protect PD neurons, improving both motor and non-motor functions and preserved dopaminergic neurons in PD rats [169–171]. In PD animal models, NSC or neural progenitor cell transplants have consistently shown positive therapeutic outcomes [172–174]. In PD mice, NSCs that express dopamine-related markers increased astrocyte and microglia presence and enhanced non-phosphorylated neurofilaments in the motor cortex, improving hyperactivity and gait [175]. In clinical trials, human neural progenitor cells/NSCs were transplanted into the dorsal putamen of eight patients with moderate PD, proving safe without immune or adverse reactions, and most patients showed motor improvements [176, 177]. Another trial involving NSC transplants into the striatum of 21 PD patients showed significant symptom improvement with no side effects, such as tumor formation or immune rejection [178].",
        "NSC transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach for AD, as NSCs can differentiate into cholinergic neurons, thus replacing and improving lost neurons [179]. They also enhance neuronal connectivity and metabolic activity in AD through compensatory mechanisms, preserving cognitive function [180, 181]. NSCs have also been shown to reduce amyloid-beta plaques, either through direct interaction or by modulating the immune response [179].",
        "Despite these promising aspects, several challenges remain. Key issues include ensuring the long-term survival and integration of transplanted cells, preventing tumorigenesis, and understanding the complex interactions between NSCs and host brain tissue [150]. Ongoing advancements in NSC differentiation protocols, delivery methods, and safety measures aim to address these challenges. Overall, NSC therapy provides a comprehensive approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases by supporting rejuvenation and combating senescence.",

        "Summary of stem cell therapy for treating neurodegenerative disease",
        "The underlying mechanisms of stem cell therapy are complex and multifaceted, encompassing neuronal replacement, paracrine mechanisms, immune modulation, neurotrophic support, mitochondrial transfer [183, 184] (Fig. 3).",
        "Fig. 3Potential mechanisms underlying the stem cell therapies. This schematic illustrates how stem cell–based therapies combat neurodegeneration through multiple mechanisms in one integrated approach. Newly grafted or converted neural cells (center) replace or supplement degenerating neurons (upper left), while transplanted stem cells or induced cells also bolster neurogenesis (upper right) by differentiating into neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or interneurons. Moreover, these cells secrete neurotrophic factors (left) that enhance cell survival and plasticity, and release anti-inflammatory mediators (lower left) to modulate immune responses involving peripheral macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes. Finally, healthy mitochondria can be transferred to damaged neurons (lower right), improving energy production and reducing oxidative stress",

Finally, healthy mitochondria can be transferred to damaged neurons (lower right), improving energy production and reducing oxidative stress",
        "One of the primary mechanisms by which stem cell therapy operates is through neuronal replacement (the “replacement” aim of the R3 paradigm) [185–187], thereby addressing the fundamental problem of neuronal loss and aging. In PD, for instance, stem cells can become dopaminergic neurons, integrating into existing neural circuits to restore functions [75, 188–191]. Similarly, hESC-derived neurons can improve motor function in Huntington’s disease models [192].",
        "Stem cell therapies offer regeneration potential by promoting neurogenesis, which is the generation of new neurons from neural stem cells. During neurogenesis, transplanted stem cells migrate to areas like the hippocampus, vital for memory and learning, where they replenish the neuronal population by generating new neurons [193]. Interestingly, stem cell therapy can support the activity of endogenous NSCs, enhancing neurogenesis by creating a favorable environment and secreting factors that promote neural differentiation and growth [132, 193].",
        "Stem cells contribute significantly to neurotrophic support by producing and releasing factors like BDNF and GDNF [108, 182, 194, 195] and other neurotrophic factors [196, 197]. Administration of MSC-overexpressing neurotrophic factors such as GDNF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), BDNF into mouse model of PD [198], AD [199, 200] and ALS [201] resulted in promising in vivo outcomes. This neurotrophic support aligns with the rejuvenation aspect of R3, preserving neurons and delay senescence of both neurons and glial cells, thereby enhancing overall brain health and longevity [202, 203].",
        "Neuroinflammation involves various chronic, pro-inflammatory, immune system-mediated processes, mostly allied with neurodegeneration [204–206]. Stem cells modulate immune responses by dampening neuroinflammation [207]. In a transgenic mouse model of ALS, administration of MSCs could hinder disease progress by downregulating inflammatory inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activation [208] and suppressing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo [208, 209]. This immunomodulatory effect is critical for rejuvenation, as it reduces the burden of the SASP, which is associated with chronic inflammation and contributes to the perpetuation of neurodegenerative processes [210].",
        "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key factor in the progression of many neurodegenerative diseases, and the ability of stem cells to enhance mitochondrial function in damaged neurons represents a significant therapeutic advantage [211–213]. For instance, restoring mitochondrial function in aged NSCs with Piracetam can improve hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo in old mice [214]. In some studies, MSCs have been shown to transfer healthy mitochondria to damaged neurons, which is crucial for restoring cellular energy production and reducing oxidative stress [215, 216]. By improving mitochondrial function, stem cells support the rejuvenation dimension of the R3 paradigm, helping delay cellular senescence and maintain the functional integrity of neurons, thus supporting the overall goal of brain rejuvenation [217, 218].",
        "Direct lineage reprogramming, also known as trans-differentiation, is a transformative process that converts one differentiated cell type directly into another without passing through a pluripotent stem cell stage [219, 220]. In the context of neuroscience, this method involves converting non-neuronal cells directly into neurons [221], offering promising research and therapeutic applications, particularly as regenerative strategies for neurodegenerative diseases [222].",
        "Genetic methods typically involve overexpressing specific TFs or microRNAs to induce neuronal identity. For example, a combination of Ascl1, Brn2, and Myt1l can convert fibroblasts or hepatocytes into functional neurons, known as induced neurons (iNs) [223, 224]. Similarly, Other TF combinations can reprogram fibroblasts and astrocytes into neurons or neural stem cells (NSCs) [225–228]. As for chemical methods, chemical cocktails consisting of Forskolin, CHIR99021, I-BET151, and Wnt/β-catenin agonists efficiently convert mouse fibroblasts to neurons [229]. A cocktail of CHIR99021 and other molecules has been demonstrated to reprogram fibroblasts into NSCs [230, 231]. Human fibroblasts were converted to vGLUT1-positive glutamatergic neurons using a combination of specific chemical compounds [232]. Astrocytes could also be converted to neurons through chemical reprogramming [233–235].",
        "In vitro reprogramming involves converting non-neuronal cells, such as fibroblasts or glial cells, into neurons within a controlled laboratory environment. Different neuronal subtypes, including dopaminergic neurons [226, 236, 237], glutamatergic neurons [238–240] and motor neurons [241], have been generated in vitro. This capability is useful for creating patient-specific neurons for cell replacement therapies. In vivo reprogramming bypass the need for cell delivery by converting local glial cells to neurons within the brain [242, 243]. This process employs TFs or chemical compounds to reprogram cells at the target site. Commonly used TFs for neural reprogramming include NeuroD1, Ascl1, Brn2, and Myt1l, which together convert glial cells into functional neurons [244, 245]. Chemical reprogramming in vivo leverages small molecules that can modulate signaling pathways, epigenetic states, and transcriptional networks to induce cellular reprogramming, especially astrocytes to neurons [246]. A cocktail named FICBY has demonstrated success in transforming astrocytes into neurons in vivo [235].",
        "n line with the R3 paradigm, direct lineage reprogramming supports “Regeneration” or “Replacement” by converting non-neural cells (e.g., glial cells or fibroblasts) into functional neurons. This process allows for neuron regeneration directly at injury sites, promoting repair and restoring function in neurodegenerative diseases while avoiding challenges associated with stem cell transplantation, like cell delivery and integration.",
        "Direct lineage reprogramming avoids the risks of tumorigenesis associated with pluripotency in iPSCs or ESCs [219, 220]. In vivo reprogramming allows conversion within the brain’s intrinsic environment, supporting better integration and functionality [247]. It also reduces the need for cell transplantation, lowering the risk of immune rejection. Additionally, since patient-specific cells can be directly reprogrammed into neurons, this technique holds great potential for creating personalized models of neurological diseases.",
        "Reprogramming can result in incomplete transformation and integration into neural networks, with potential off-target effects [248]. Ensuring the functionality and maturity of reprogrammed neurons in vitro, is challenging, as is their survival post-transplantation. In vivo methods require precise control to avoid aberrant reprogramming, which could lead to tumorigenesis or other adverse effects [222]. Additionally, the efficiency of reprogramming and long-term survival of newly generated neurons are critical issues that need addressing.",
        "Partial reprogramming, which aligns with the rejuvenation aspect of the R3 paradigm, involves the temporary activation of OSKM factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC) to reverse cellular aging effects, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered gene expression [207, 249, 250]. This rejuvenation effect is achieved without pushing the cells into a fully pluripotent state, which would erase their identity and lead to potential risks such as tumorigenesis.",
        "Several studies have demonstrated the potential of partial reprogramming to induce rejuvenation across a variety of tissues in mice including pancreas and muscle [251, 252], to different extents depending on the cell type [253–255]. In a study, mice subjected to periodic activation of OSKM factors exhibited reduced signs of aging, improved tissue regeneration, and better overall health, suggesting that partial reprogramming can be an effective strategy for promoting rejuvenation [256]. Another study demonstrated that partial reprogramming increased the lifespan of older mice by 109% compared to controls [257].",
        "Partial reprogramming has also emerged as a promising approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases [258, 259], with effects observed in the spinal cord [260] and brain regions such as the optic nerve, hippocampus, and striatum [261–264]. Improvements have been noted in neuroblast populations in aged neurogenic niches with whole-body partial reprogramming [265]. Another promising application of partial cell reprogramming in brain is restoration of visual function [262]. When inducible OSK-containing AAV9 was delivered to the retinal ganglion cells of old mice via intravenous delivery, continuous expression of OSK factors led to a partially restored vision [262].",
        "Partially reprogrammed mice apparently exhibited rejuvenation of certain cellular phenotypes, including the reduction of mitochondrial ROS and restoration of H3K9me levels [249]. Cyclic cell partial reprogramming was shown to return the transcriptome, lipidome, and metabolome of multiple tissues to a younger state [253]. Interestingly, targeting partial reprogramming specifically to the neurogenic niche also boosts the proportion of neuroblasts and their precursors in old mice and improves several molecular signatures of aging, suggesting that the beneficial effects of reprogramming are niche intrinsic [265]. Additionally, in cellular models, partial reprogramming has been shown to rejuvenate aged human cells, making them function more like their younger counterparts [252]. This includes improvements in cellular metabolism, reduced oxidative stress, and enhanced DNA repair mechanisms, all of which contribute to a more youthful cellular phenotype [252].",
        "The benefits of partial reprogramming using OSKM factors include potential neuronal regeneration and neuroprotection from degenerative diseases like AD and PD, along with reduced secondary degeneration from neuroinflammation and oxidative stress [252]. However, risks include potential tumorigenesis from improper regulation of pluripotency activation that increase proliferation and suppress somatic cell identity [252, 266, 267], leading to unwanted cell proliferation [268, 269]. Issues such as incomplete reprogramming, coding mutations, and cell heterogeneity pose complications for therapeutic applications [270, 271]. Additionally, unintended differentiation pathways could form non-functional or maladaptive cells, with examples of liver and intestinal failure noted from continuous Yamanaka factor expression in mice [272, 273]. Therefore, robust pre-clinical and clinical evaluations are critical to determine the safety and efficacy of partial reprogramming before its clinical adoption.",
        "Cell-based strategies rooted in the R3 paradigm (rejuvenation, regeneration, and replacement) hold great promise in regenerative medicine for neurodegenerative diseases. However, several challenges specific to this context need to be overcome.",
        "In the aging population, mechanical stress during implantation, loss of extracellular matrix, and nutrient and oxygen deprivation are exacerbated, along with host inflammatory responses, often leading to significant cell death post-transplantation [274]. This issue is compounded by the age-related decline in adult stem cell functionality, reducing the efficacy of regenerative therapies [275]. The disparity between results in animal models and aged human patients emphasizes the need for more relevant pre-clinical models and a better understanding of age-related stem cell changes [275]. Furthermore, the translation of cellular therapies from “bench to bedside” remains challenging due to various intrinsic and extrinsic barriers, including manufacturing, regulatory, reimbursement, and clinical adoption issues [276].",
        "Comprehensive assessment of safety and efficacy is crucial. While pre-clinical data are promising, clinical trials must determine the true safety and effectiveness in humans with neurodegenerative diseases. Rigorous trial protocols and appropriate outcome measures are required. Long-term follow-up is essential to detect potential late-emerging adverse effects, such as in partial reprogramming, where long-term consequences like tumorigenesis or epigenetic instability need to be ruled out.",
        "Given the heterogeneity of neurodegenerative diseases, personalized medicine is vital. Biomarkers are needed to predict patient responses. For stem cell therapy, these could be based on genetic profiles, disease stages, and cellular damage levels to select suitable candidates [277]. Similar considerations apply to direct lineage and partial reprogramming to identify patients likely to benefit and those at risk [278–281].",
        "The development and application of these R3-based strategies raise regulatory and ethical questions [282]. Regulatory requirements for different applications, especially involving stem cell-derived tissue constructs in neurodegenerative disease treatment, are complex and lack clear guidance [283]. Ethical issues include implications for donors, risks related to iPSCs like unwanted differentiation or malignancy, and concerns about MSCs promoting tumor growth, especially in the context of an aging population seeking these therapies [284].",
        "Remarkable progress has been made in R3-focused cell-based strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Advances in stem cell therapy, direct lineage reprogramming, and partial reprogramming offer promising solutions for addressing cellular deficits. Emerging technologies like gene editing and combinatorial therapies provide additional opportunities. However, challenges such as cell and factor delivery and integration, safety and efficacy evaluation, personalized medicine, and regulatory and ethical considerations still exist. Overcoming these challenges requires continued research, collaboration, and innovation. With further progress, R3-based therapies have the potential to transform the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and bring new hope to patients.",

        "The clinical movement disorder syndrome of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) occurs due to a progressive loss of midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons. In fact, most patients remain free of clinical motor symptoms until the PD pathology has already reached an advanced stage with most (∼60%) of the selectively vulnerable dopamine (DA) neurons dysfunctional or dead, and with a consequent depletion of roughly 70% of striatal DA levels and synapses (Engelender and Isacson, 2017). For this reason, and since any retardation of degeneration is unlikely to be absolute, it is reasonable to develop cell replacement for the lost neurons. Such “live cell” replacement therapies are conceptually different from classical pharmacology. The current mainstay treatment for PD related motor symptoms is based on a pharmacological approach from 1957 using levodopa (L-dopa) (Carlsson et al., 1957) or dopaminergic agonists that elevate DA levels or stimulate DA receptors (Radad et al., 2005; Figure 1). Although this treatment can be effective for many years, its long-term and chronic use can result in the development of “motor complications,” including wearing-off, on-off fluctuations (Eriksson et al., 1984) and abnormal movements termed L-dopa-induced dyskinesias (Fahn, 2003). L-dopa crosses the blood-brain-barrier where it is converted to DA by dopa-decarboxylase containing cells; these include the remaining striatal dopaminergic terminals themselves, and also non-dopaminergic cells including cells in the blood-brain-barrier wall and serotoninergic neurons. Conversion of L-dopa to DA in non-dopaminergic cells following oral (non-continuous) administration of L-dopa, results in a pulsatile, non-physiological release of DA, which may act on supersensitive DA receptors in the striatum and contribute to the development of dyskinesias (Fahn, 2003). Newer dopaminergic agonists can activate DA receptors but they are not as effective as L-dopa, and in fact create substantial side effects on their own, including dyskinesia, albeit at a slower rate (Borovac, 2016). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is another therapeutic modality but does not treat the DA neuron generation itself. DBS disrupts the circuits and functions as a depolarization blocker, which allows patients to take the same or higher L-dopa dose with less side effects, including dyskinesia, and dystonia (Herrington et al., 2016). It includes a surgical insertion of a medical device containing electrodes extending to the target region (subthalamic nucleus) and a pulse generator (Herrington et al., 2016) and carries the risk of major surgery. Generally, DBS works well initially but with time the circuitry readapts and over time is less effective in symptomatic relief (Buttner et al., 2019). In addition to the high initial surgical cost, patients require battery replacements every 3–5 years (Dang et al., 2019) and anticipating battery failure is also a critical clinical issue since it can result in a subacute worsening of symptoms (Montuno et al., 2013). Additionally, there is a risk that the DBS can result in cognitive side-effects if not implanted properly (Fields and Troster, 2000; Cernera et al., 2019).",
        "Schematic overview of available or experimental treatments and procedures for Parkinson’s disease. (I) Normal dopaminergic (shown in green) and striatal (shown in blue) synapses, and regulated dopamine (DA) release and reuptake (dopamine transporters shown in red) in the normal brain. (II) Shows current and experimental treatments: A, L-dopa; B, dopamine agonists; C) Deep brain stimulation (DBS), and D, gene therapy. The unique aspect of cell therapy (see III, E) is that it restores physiological dopamine release by synapses provided through new neurons implanted into the striatum.",
        "Other new modalities being explored for PD include gene therapy and cell therapy (Isacson and Kordower, 2008; Figure 1). Gene therapy creates enzymes to make L-dopa and DA non-synaptically (Mandel et al., 1999, 2008), similar to the use of a pump, without any cellular specificity or feedback control. From our and previous studies, gene therapy for neurotransmission defects are not likely to be helpful to the circuitry in patients as gene additions to striatal neurons will not control DA release.",
        "Due to a lack of biofeedback and synaptic control in all current pharmacological therapies, they eventually lead to dyskinesias or other side-effects (see Figure 1). Therefore, there are efforts toward re-creating a synaptic DA release through the use of neural transplantation (Strecker et al., 1987; Clarke et al., 1988; Bjorklund et al., 2002; Isacson et al., 2003; Vinuela et al., 2008; Tsui and Isacson, 2011). To date, mDA cell preparations from aborted fetuses have been clinically tested and shown efficacy in PD patients (Lindvall et al., 1990; Freed et al., 1992; Kordower et al., 1998; Piccini et al., 1999; Hagell et al., 2000; Mendez et al., 2005; Redmond et al., 2008; Hallett et al., 2014; Kefalopoulou et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016). From a meta-analysis it was clear that if the fetal mDA cells are prepared and surgically injected appropriately, a 10–15 years of benefit is obtained with reductions in dyskinesia and off-time, and no additional side-effects appear (Barker et al., 2013). This improved function is because cell replacement using mDA neurons restores lost synapses. These new synapses functions with biofeedback regulation of DA locally in the synaptic microenvironment, resulting in physiological DA release and uptake, reducing the number of supersensitive DA receptors and providing long-term benefits for the patients with fewer side-effects (Figure 1, Vinuela et al., 2008; Tsui and Isacson, 2011). For these reasons and in a future perspective, cell therapy for PD when tested clinically to be safe and efficacious in moderate to severe patients, may potentially be used as a first-line of treatment to obviate the use of pharmacological DA therapies. When clinical trials using autologous or allogeneic midbrain neuron transplantation to PD patients are successful then cell therapy for PD would be a highly competitive treatment compared to currently available modalities.",
        "The cell-based therapy approaches in PD aim to replace nigrostriatal DA terminals lost by the disease process, with fetal or stem cell derived DA neurons placed directly into the caudate-putamen, and potentially also in substantia nigra. Cell replacement therapy with mDA neurons in PD addresses both the motor symptoms of PD, as well as L-dopa-induced dyskinesias. In the most successful cases (Mendez et al., 2005; Kefalopoulou et al., 2014), the requirement for L-dopa medication has been negated or substantially reduced. When new mDA neurons (which are autonomous pace-maker neurons, not needing afferent input to regulate transmitter release) are engrafted into the normal target regions of nigrostriatal DA neurons, they establish synapses with mature host striatal neurons and provide physiologically appropriate DA release and synaptic feedback control in the host brain (Zetterstrom et al., 1986; Vinuela et al., 2008). As discussed above, replacement of DA terminals in this manner may be far more effective in ameliorating the motor symptoms of PD than a pump-like pharmacological delivery of DA into the striatum that lacks physiological release and reuptake mechanisms (Figure 1). Long-term remarkable and neurologically clear benefits [approximately 50–60% reduction in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores off DA drug therapy] to PD patients following fetal DA neuron transplantation has been reported for over 18 years, including our own work (Mendez et al., 2005; Politis et al., 2010; Hallett et al., 2014; Kefalopoulou et al., 2014), and this outcompetes any current treatment for PD. Moreover, implanted fetal DA neurons can prevent progressive worsening of PD motor scores over at least 14 years (Kefalopoulou et al., 2014; Ivar Mendez, unpublished data). These clinical benefits are associated with evidence of physiological changes using PET and functional MRI neuroimaging (see Figure 2; Mendez et al., 2005). Our data also shows that transplanted fetal ventral mDA neurons remain healthy long-term (up to 14 years post-transplantation, the longest time-point we have studied to date) following transplantation into the putamen of PD patients, and despite ongoing disease processes in the host brain (Hallett et al., 2014).",

        "Cell replacement therapy using DA neurons for PD in the clinic, has so far utilized ventral mDA neurons derived from fetal sources. More recently, attempts to replace missing DA neurons in PD preclinical models have evolved from this innovative and complex fetal DA cell transplantation method toward a potential scalable method that depends on stem cell-derived DA neurons (Hargus et al., 2010; Kriks et al., 2011; Sundberg et al., 2013; Grealish et al., 2014). The replacement using fetal neurons depended on the events of elective abortions providing fetal tissue of the midbrain including the dopaminergic neurons. This method was not scalable and, in most cases, only a few dozen patients were appropriately transplanted worldwide in monitored clinical trials (Barker et al., 2013). However, these conceptual advances of cell therapy for PD have helped accelerate the realization of regenerative medicine in PD.",
        "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide several advantages over embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as a cell source for cell replacement in PD and other disorders, including the ability to use patient’s own cells, or HLA-matched cells and thus reduce (HLA-matched) or eliminate (autologous iPSCs) the need for any immunosuppression. Immune compatibility is universally known to be very important in all fields of transplantation. Immune suppression is not a trivial matter and may underlie some of the variability previously reported in clinical trials of fetal derived DA neuron transplantation (Barker et al., 2013). Indeed, it was previously reported that following the cessation of immunotherapy 6 months after fetal cell transplantation, PD patients lost the benefits of the transplantation (Olanow et al., 2003), and thus, a delayed immune or inflammatory response could have affected the long-term survival, growth, and function of the transplanted DA neurons. Currently there are plans to transplant dopaminergic neurons obtained from general human ES cells (allogeneic) into PD patients in clinical trials (Studer, 2017; Parmar et al., 2020). In addition, there has been an initiation of a clinical trial in Japan based on the work of Takahashi’s laboratory (Takahashi, 2017), where PD patients will receive HLA matched iPSC-derived dopamine neurons. The authors of this review will elect to test the fully autologous patient derived mDA neurons in clinical trials. The results of all of these studies will help guide the future approach for most benefit for the patients. Given how far along the PD field is in the steps toward developing sustainable cell therapy for PD, it is likely that what is learnt from these studies will also serve as a major milestone for cell and regenerative therapy for other parts of the brain and nervous system. Beyond PD, cell therapy as a modality can be used for other neuronal and glial disorders associated with the brain and the periphery (Freeman et al., 2000; Goldman et al., 2012; Cunningham et al., 2014).",
        "Another approach to avoid the need of immune suppression is the generation of a universal donor cell that will evade the immune system either by HLA engineering or immune cloaking strategies (Lanza et al., 2019). These approaches are developed from knowledge of how malignant and transmissible cancer cells evade the immune system or understandings of how pathogens and parasites have evolved to escape immune recognition (Lanza et al., 2019), and it is not fully known what potential safety issues the introduction of such changes in the cells might lead to. The specific risk with using HLA-negative cells is malignancies. Reduced HLA expression is a known mechanism with which cancer cells can evade the immune system and any transplanted cells turned cancerous could therefore be likely to go undetected by the immune system. Introduction of suicide genes that can be activated if cells turn malignant might be a safety strategy in the future (Lanza et al., 2019). However, autologous cells already provide a great system for naturally recognizing a dying or dysfunctional cell.",
        "Another approach that would also eliminate the need of immune suppression is the direct conversion of somatic cells to DA neurons in vivo using virus technology. The current approaches for PD aim to convert astrocytes to DA neurons (Rivetti di Val Cervo et al., 2017). This could be a potentially interesting approach but is still in early exploratory stages. A potential pitfall of this strategy is the local loss of the astrocytes that are reprogrammed to neurons and the potential associated problems with this local astrocyte loss in a human brain. Astrocytes have numerous important functions, and many of these functions are essential for brain homeostasis and neuronal health. For example, they provide neurotrophic and metabolic support, regulate synaptogenesis and synaptic function, contribute to the blood-brain-barrier and play an important role in limiting the spread of local immune response initiated my microglia, preventing cell damage to surrounding tissue. There is also a cellular and molecular diversity among astrocytes, thus understanding what cells and functions are lost would be important to predict how a conversion of local astrocytes to DA neurons might affect the function of the brain in a PD patient (Khakh and Deneen, 2019).",
        "As described in Figure 3, our research team started an original stem cell-based cell therapy program for PD in 1998 (Deacon et al., 1998) and had by 2002 (Bjorklund et al., 2002) reached a point when mouse midbrain DA neurons could be derived from ES cells and work functionally in rodent models of PD. This work continued with the use of iPSCs, and in 2008 our team and collaborators published work on the first mDA neurons differentiated from mouse iPSCs and their function in PD animal models (Wernig et al., 2008), followed by mDA neurons differentiated from human iPSCs from healthy donors and sporadic PD patients in 2009, which also demonstrated functional effect in rodent PD animal models (Hargus et al., 2010).",
        "Progression of autologous cell therapy for Parkinson’s disease. In green are the discoveries and publications that have contributed to this timeline by the authors and their collaborators (Schmidt et al., 1981; Lindvall et al., 1988; Widner et al., 1992; Dinsmore et al., 1996; Deacon et al., 1997, 1998; Fink et al., 2000; Schumacher et al., 2000; Bjorklund et al., 2002; Mendez et al., 2005; Takahashi et al., 2007; Wernig et al., 2008; Cooper et al., 2010; Hargus et al., 2010; Hallett et al., 2014, 2015).",
        "In 2015, our team published the first proof-of-concept (POC) data in non-human primates (NHPs) showing functional recovery and long-term survival of autologous transplanted iPSC-derived DA neurons. However, in this parkinsonian NHP model, unilateral autologous transplantation provided POC data for the long-term functional recovery of PD-like motor symptoms (increased daytime activity and reduction of time taken to complete a skilled motor task) for up to at least 2 years (Hallett et al., 2015). Behavioral improvement was accompanied by increased (compared to pre-transplantation values) DA transporter binding sites using PET neuroimaging, survival of engrafted DA neurons (>13,000), no inflammatory response, and no proliferating cells. Notably, no immunosuppression was administered to the recovered primate included in this study at any time, thus validating the use of autologous transplantation for use in clinical studies. In a recent study (Osborn et al., 2020) we have demonstrated functional restoration in two additional parkinsonian NHPs receiving autologous transplantation of iPSC-derived mDA cells (see Figure 4). In these animals, even after 8 years of chronic PD without any spontaneous recovery, the parkinsonian NHPs improved functionally by the implanted iPSC-derived dopaminergic cells. The degree of survival of the transplanted mDA neurons was consistent with our previously published work in primates (Hallett et al., 2015). From this work, we conclude that autologous transplantation provides functional recovery (reduced motor dysfunction) and transplanted tyrosine hydroxylase positive DA neurons survived in the putamen for at least 2 years after transplantation (the time of sacrifice). The additional confirmative data (see Figure 4) showed that functional recovery was observed with ∼20,000 surviving tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the graft. There was no observable immune response present, as assessed by staining for microglia in the graft and in the neighboring host putamen. Consistent with these data, a recent study using xeno-grafting of human iPSCs into parkinsonian NHPs, demonstrated that a similar number of surviving DA neurons (∼16,000) resulted in functional improvement of the immunosuppressed primates, validating our present and previous reports of the effectiveness of this cell-dose in NHPs (Kikuchi et al., 2017).",

(A,B) Autologous transplantation of iPSC-mDA cells into the left putamen of an MPTP-lesioned primate provides functional improvement in the right (contralateral) forelimb in an automated Movement Analysis Panel (A), and survival of dopamine (TH+) neurons (>20,000) in the transplanted putamen (B). (C,C’) Robust survival of TH + neurons at 1.5 years following autologous transplantation of iPSC-mDA cells into the left putamen of an additional MPTP-lesioned NHP (Osborn et al., 2020).

        "iPSCs, when exposed to a mixture of small molecules, can be differentiated toward mDA neuron fate (Figure 5; Cooper et al., 2010). Protocols published prior to 2010 (Roy et al., 2006; Sonntag et al., 2007; Chiba et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2008) resulted in a very low fraction of the A9 mDA neuron subpopulation that originates in the substantia nigra pars compacta and is lost in PD patients. A comprehensive study was published in 2010 (Cooper et al., 2010) that discerned factors important for the generation of this DA neuron subpopulation. Careful titrations of retinoic acid levels show that 10nM retinoic acid significantly improved the expression of the transcription factor (TF) Engrailed-1, a TF important for mDA development and survival (Cooper et al., 2010). Additional changes to previously published protocols (Sonntag et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2009) included a more potent form of sonic hedgehog recombinant protein, specification of the subtype of FGF-8 used (FGF-8a rather than FGF-8b) and the use of recombinant Wnt-1 for canonical Wnt pathway (Wnt/β-catenin pathway) activation. These changes generated a human neural progenitor cell population that exhibited a transcriptional profile (Muhr et al., 1999; Nordstrom et al., 2002, 2006) consistent with midbrain regionalization (Cooper et al., 2010). Several protocols are now available worldwide for midbrain differentiation that includes DA neurons (Cooper et al., 2010; Kriks et al., 2011; Sundberg et al., 2013; Kikuchi et al., 2017; Nolbrant et al., 2017) and protocols are being refined by use of xeno-free procedures and highest grade available reagents (Nolbrant et al., 2017; Osborn et al., 2017) in order to improve reproducibility of differentiations and eliminate components incompatible with human transplantations (Cooper et al., 2012). These protocols differ in a few specific aspects (Cooper et al., 2010; Kriks et al., 2011; Sundberg et al., 2013; Kikuchi et al., 2017; Nolbrant et al., 2017) and as described below some teams chose to use progenitor cells whereas others prefer the post mitotic equivalence of fetal neurons.",

(B,C) Cells co-expressed TH (blue), FOXA2 (red) and calbindin (green, B) or GIRK2 (green, C), indicative of an A10 or A9 DA neuron phenotype, respectively. Scale bar (A) = 50 μm, (B,C) = 10 μm.

        "The decision of whether to transplant the mDA patterned cells at a progenitor stage, as post-mitotic neurons or a mix thereof determines what cell type markers are used in the quality control process. Furthermore, in order to allow for quality control testing of cell batches for transplantation and allow flexibility as to when and where a patient undergoes the transplantation surgery the cells need to be cryopreserved. The maturity and timing selected for cryopreservation is also important as it can impact the survival of the dopaminergic neurons. If the cells are frozen at too mature of a stage, the survival of the DA neurons after transplantation is less than if frozen and transplanted at an early post-mitotic stage or progenitor stage (Osborn et al., 2015). Different groups are using different approaches and timing for freezing (Kriks et al., 2011; Nolbrant et al., 2017; Osborn et al., 2017), which in turn leads to different markers being relevant for use in pre-transplantation criteria (Kee et al., 2017; Kirkeby et al., 2017; Osborn and Hallett, 2017). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining is an indicator of post-mitotic dopaminergic neurons that in recent protocols start to be expressed at about day in vitro 17. Therefore, it can be used together with FoxA2 as an indicator of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and the percentual co-positivity of the two can be set as a positive cellular marker criterion for mDA cell transplantations. In cases where only progenitor cells are transplanted one must rely on additional markers to determine dopaminergic progenitors and predict future dopaminergic cell content (Kee et al., 2017; Kirkeby et al., 2017; Osborn and Hallett, 2017). Given that several different preclinical studies have been successful in transplanting at various time-points (DIV16-49) (Hargus et al., 2010; Kriks et al., 2011; Sundberg et al., 2013; Doi et al., 2014; Hallett et al., 2015; Kikuchi et al., 2017; Nolbrant et al., 2017; Osborn et al., 2017; Wakeman et al., 2017) and resulting in similar functional grafts containing mDA neurons, it is premature to say what is the most optimal protocol and strategy. Of note, the only grafted cells that have shown to generate functional recovery in parkinsonian NHPs have been with cell preparations that contain post-mitotic neurons (Hallett et al., 2015; Kikuchi et al., 2017). Furthermore, although mDA neurons are the cell type that is responsible for the functional effect in grafts, the midbrain cell population produced does not necessarily require cell sorting since all clinical experience to date, using fetal cell transplantation, includes a mixture of midbrain cells. It is in fact possible that removing the other midbrain companion cells may reduce trophic interactions necessary (positive bystander effect) for substantia nigra survival (Hedlund et al., 2008). The autologous approach as planned by this team is summarized in Figure 6. The future pre-clinical and clinical studies, on-going and planned will provide a guide of the specifics for the most efficacious and safe cells or cell compositions for transplantation, whether pure mDA neurons or a mixed midbrain cell composition and whether progenitors, post-mitotic neurons or a mixture of both are preferred.",

        "A misconception associated with using cell replacement therapy in neurodegenerative disorders, is that the transplanted cells will eventually succumb to the same pathological processes and disease that presented in the host brain, resulting in reduced function of the transplanted cells. In the PD field, this is based on popular theory about pathological “spread” of α-synuclein from host to transplant (Kordower et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008), and the observations that a low percentage of transplanted fetal dopaminergic neurons contain α-synuclein immune reactive inclusions over a decade after transplantation (Kordower et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008, 2016). Discrepancies in success of fetal dopaminergic neurons come from procedural differences in these transplantations (Redmond et al., 2008; Cooper et al., 2009). When the fetal tissue is dissociated to a cell suspension prior to transplantation, the grafts remain healthy 14 years post-transplantation and have none or very few α-synuclein inclusions after 14 years (Mendez et al., 2008; Hallett et al., 2014). However, if transplanting cellular aggregates instead of cells in suspension, the grafts are surrounded by activated microglia (Li et al., 2008; Kurowska et al., 2011) and around 2–12% of the dopaminergic neurons in the grafts have α-synuclein positive inclusions after 12–24 years (Kordower et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008, 2016). Importantly, there is no evidence of any clinical or functional relevance of such limited pathology (Cooper et al., 2009). In fact, transplanted fetal midbrain dopaminergic neurons have been shown to function, as evidenced by improvements in PD motor symptoms, for over a decade after transplantation (Li et al., 2016) with the longest documented functional improvement for at least 18 + years (Hallett et al., 2014; Kefalopoulou et al., 2014). In fact, even at these long time frames, patients have been able to reduce or discontinue pharmacological DA replacement therapy (Kefalopoulou et al., 2014). Another way of looking at this issue in a medical and biological perspective is to raise the simple functional question that if the transplants really were under “attack,” this would be contradicted by the clinical facts of striking clinical benefits that cell replacement of mDA neurons can provide. Using cell therapy, it is surprising but true that transplanted neurons can remain functional for at least 10–20 years and show no histological evidence or neuritic pathology. These cell therapy clinical studies have had no gene modifiers, including of α-synuclein, or any or blocking of α-synuclein function (Hallett et al., 2014; Kefalopoulou et al., 2014). Therefore, the planned clinical trials by several groups worldwide are aligned on the scientific and biological view that newly implanted functional DA neurons are not affected significantly or functionally by the underlying disease process at least for several decades (Astradsson et al., 2008). Moreover, our data and others studying human cells transplanted to patients with PD, provides a perspective of the actual development of clinical PD in the patient’s own DA cells (Hallett et al., 2014) which do not succumb to dysfunction and detrimental pathology until in the vast majority of cases, at least in the 6th–7th decade of life.",
        "The majority of patients with PD (>85%) have sporadic forms, and the genetic forms of PD are relatively rare. However, even in cases where the patients have underlying cellular problems due to genetic variants, they have surviving functional DA neurons for the majority of their life, in some cases up to >60 years of age, before any noticeable degeneration that results in functional impairment occur. Even in severe familial genetic cases (for example, α-synuclein mutation, or copy number variants), PD does not present for 30 years or more. Therefore, it is both logical and reasonable to assume that even the most severe, rare genetic forms would, after transplantation of new young cells, have highly adaptive functional DA neurons for synaptic signaling for at least 20–25 years. In fact, both rodent (Hargus et al., 2010) and NHP (Kikuchi et al., 2017) studies have demonstrated that human iPSC-derived mDA cell preparations from both healthy subjects and PD patients work equally well in restoring synapses and motor function in parkinsonian animal models. On the contrary, long-term restorative function has not yet been shown in parkinsonian NHPs for mDA neuron preparations differentiated from human ES cell lines, despite significant efforts.",
        "There are several advantages of the autologous cell therapy approach over allogeneic or MHC matching (Emborg et al., 2013; Morizane et al., 2013; Hallett et al., 2015; Table 1). One obvious advantage, relative to allogeneic cell transplants, is that autologous iPSC can be used in PD patients without the need for immunosuppression (Hallett et al., 2015). The question about the need for immunosuppression is important at many levels:",
        "Adavantages of autologous transplantation for Parkinson’s disease.",
        "Basic biology of cell integration and recognition: Autologous neural cell transplants potentially are better integrated, have better axonal networks (Emborg et al., 2013; Hallett et al., 2015) and have better functional effects than non-autologous transplants (Hallett et al., 2015). A relatively low number of autologous dopaminergic midbrain neurons derived from iPSCs (∼13–14,000) can be sufficient to reverse parkinsonism in NHPs (Figure 4; Hallett et al., 2015; Osborn et al., 2020).",
        "Rejection by immunological mechanisms at cellular and synaptic levels: A primate study demonstrated clear benefits to the use of autologous transplants rather than allografts in both cell survival and immune response (Morizane et al., 2013). A different primate study looking at both the acute and subacute immune response showed that MHC matching improves the engraftment of iPSC-derived mDA neurons in NHPs. But although MHC matching reduced the immune response, it did not completely prevent an immune reaction and the conclusion was that MHC matching still needs to be combined with immunosuppressive drugs but MHC matching might reduce the required dose and duration of such therapy (Morizane et al., 2017). Studies with fetal mDA neurons in the clinic have demonstrated several cases in which the clinical beneficial response is reduced after removal of immune suppression by 6–9 months after cell implantation (Olanow et al., 2003). Decades of studies of allogeneic brain transplantation demonstrates sensitization of the B cell component of the immune system (Kordower et al., 1997), providing increasing antibody titers to such allogeneic transplants. Clearly, the brain immune system is capable of activating both T and B cell responses to interfere with neuronal transplants (Kordower et al., 1997). Should future trials of allogeneic transplants show variable rejections, it will be an enormous obstacle to remove immune suppression or scale to a larger group of patients, as patients would not want to risk transplant rejection and loss of function. Attempts to simplify an allogeneic universal cell source by removing HLA antigens and related MHC systems may occur in the future, but there is almost nothing known about the need for the immune system to eliminate unhealthy or dying cells that are genetically manipulated in such a way. The advantage of autologous cell sources is that the natural biology for cell/transplant integration, recognition and function is coupled with an immune competence to eliminate dying or dysfunctional cells, as would occur normally in any brain or biological tissue. Given this, autologous cell therapy may become a gold standard for which the other future cell therapies need to be measured; and",
        "The health risks to the patient recipients: Patients with compromised immune system are always considered high risk recipients for systemic immune suppression for any amount of time. Immune responses as observed with allografting or xenografting can be detrimental to transplant function (Soderstrom et al., 2008; Morizane et al., 2013). Data from already well-established medical disciplines demonstrate significant differences in risk profiles between autologous and allogeneic transplants. An illustration is the relevant stem cell bone marrow transplantation therapy, where the morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stays and costs are reduced by autologous approaches (Rowe et al., 1994; Majhail et al., 2013). Taken together, autologous transplantations overcome several limitations as described above, which will likely lead to improved outcomes in many scenarios, including risk for graft-host rejections, local immune responses that clearly reduces functional synaptic transmission, and morbidity risk for patients taking severe immunosuppressive drugs.",
        "A conventional view, criticism and perception is that autologous cell therapy is always more expensive than allogeneic cell therapy. It is true that an allogeneic or HLA-matched approach would allow for larger batches of cells to be produced and quality control tested for use in multiple patients, whereas an autologous cell transplantation approach requires preparation of cell batches for each patient and quality control testing of each batch, which initially (but less so with increased scale and automation) drives up the cost of the cell production step. However, when looking at the total healthcare cost, this conventional view is not necessarily true (Majhail et al., 2013). An interesting future perspective is that many payors may try to avoid allogeneic transplants given the documented higher current costs due to immune suppression and transplant rejection. In addition, as outlined above, for neural transplantation and maybe other cell types, the functional integration is improved with recognition of autologous antigens. In well-established medical disciplines there are significant differences in risk profiles between autologous and allogeneic transplants. An example is stem cell bone marrow transplantation cell therapy, where the morbidity and costs for failed allogeneic transplants is much higher than for autologous transplants (Majhail et al., 2013). The medical transplantation field, hospitals, health care providers, and payors of health care have learned significantly from decades of autologous vs. allogeneic cell therapy in patients requiring bone marrow transplantation. Some of this learning may apply to autologous cell therapy for brain degenerative diseases like PD. For bone marrow stem cell transplantation, payors and health care providers can estimate over $100,000 per patient for completed autologous bone marrow transplantation cell therapy and follow-up. However, the average estimation for payor and health care costs for allogeneic transplants and cell therapy can be several-fold higher (Majhail et al., 2013). The reason is that allogeneic transplantation presents a large and significant morbidity risk to the patients due to immunological and prominently immune suppression issues (Rowe et al., 1994). The high risk for patient morbidity creates a significant burden and additional cost to the health care system, where the potential very large cost per patient of allogeneic cell therapy needs to be viewed as a potential loss of benefit to those who could receive an effective autologous transplant. For payors and the healthcare system the average expected cost of allogeneic transplants is therefore in reality higher than autologous cell therapy. Whether these considerations also apply to allogeneic vs. autologous transplantation of brain cells into the CNS will hopefully become evident early in the process of safety/Phase 1 trials in humans. With this future perspective in mind, we believe there are several reasons why overall, the health care systems will likely support technical and medical innovation that support autologous transplants for most applicable medical conditions. In such a perspective, this overall strategic support for autologous transplantation will also apply to autologous cell therapy approaches for PD and related disorders.",

However, the evidence is insufficient to prove the results due to high risk of bias and low-quality evidence of outcomes. Further researches of larger, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and multicenter trials are still in demand.",

        "Peripheral arterial diseases (PAD), as a member of arteriosclerosis, mostly occur in lower extremity arteries. The morbidity of PAD generally ranged from 3 to 10%, but among the people over 60 years old, it can reach above 15% and it upregulates with aging [1]. PAD is one of the most serious complications in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), and the overall prevalence is 21.2% in China [2]. If not properly treated in the early stage, it is very possible for the patient to suffer from critical limb ischemia (CLI) causing rest pain, ulcer, necrosis, and finally leading to amputation. The rate of amputation among PAD patients is about 1.6~4.1% with even much higher cardiovascular event incidence and mortality [3–5].",
        "Patients with CLI are commonly treated conventionally at an early stage, such as risk factor control, exercise training, utilizing antiplatelet drugs, and vasodilator [6–12]. But the reconstruction of the blood circulation, which can be achieved by surgery and interventional therapy, presented to be the key to the treatment [13, 14]. A 5-year survival rate which was less than 50% determined a worrisome prognosis. And when both surgery and interventional therapy is not feasible, amputation may be the last choice of the patients. However, amputation has a high rate of mortality about 25~50%, of which 5~20% in perioperational period, and the re-amputation rate is up to 30% [15]. The risk is significantly raising in patients with DM, for the segmental and diffuse arterial disease as well as the higher risk of cardiovascular event. Since 40% patients have missed the chance for surgery or interventional therapy [16], a new method is in great demand to reduce the amputation and mortality rate for “no-option” patients.",
        "Autologous stem cell therapy is gradually known as a new therapy. Asahara isolated endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from blood in 1997 [17]. EPCs are a type of adult stem cells, derived from adult bone marrow and is mainly found in the embryo, adult peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood, and bone marrow. EPCs can develop into endothelial cells and then promote revascularization. Methods for isolation of EPCs include magnetic bead selection, density gradient centrifugation, and differential adhesion method and so on. Many animal trials found improved blood flows in ischemic limbs after stem cell implantation [18–21]. Afterward, the therapies of stem cells have been applied to patients with PAD. The first trial in human called therapeutic angiogenesis using cell transplantation (TACT) was performed in Japan [22]. Since then, a growing body of evidence suggested that autologous stem cell therapy was more effective than standard care/conventional treatment for PAD [23]. Former systematic review pooled analysis of both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs; however, studies of different designs cannot be assessed in unification. Therefore, in the present study, we updated the systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous implantation of stem cells for PAD.",
        "We followed the recommendations from the Cochrane Collaboration for systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs and reported according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statements [24].",
        "We searched RCTs involving patients with PAD who were treated with autologous implantation of all kinds of stem cells from electronic medical databases including MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and ClinicalTrials.gov from initial period to September 2018. The MeSH terms were outlined in Additional file 1: Table S1.",
        "Two investigators selected the studies and extracted data from studies independently. Controversy was resolved by discussion with a third investigator. Extracted data included basic information (author name, study year, country, sample size, design of study, follow-up time), characteristics of patients (sex, age, stage of PAD), methods, intervention details (type and number of stem cells, transplantation routine, intervention in control group), outcomes, and side effect. The bias of the trials included in our study was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Interventions [25]. The components included allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, caregivers, outcome assessors and outcome adjudicators, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. For each item, studies were categorized as high, low, or unclear risk of bias.",
        "The primary outcomes consisted of amputation rate, major amputation rate, ulcer healing rate, and side effect. The second outcomes were ankle-brachial index (ABI), transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcO2), rest pain score, and pain-free walking distance (PFWD).",
        "We performed a meta-analysis of all RCTs using the data from the cell therapy group and control group. Statistical analysis was conducted via RevMan 5.3 and Stata 12.0. Continuous and dichotomous outcome variables were respectively described as mean difference (MD) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), which were derived from Inverse Variance and Mantel-Haenszel estimate and summarized by Forest plots. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by the I2 parameter and chi-squared tests. Fixed effect model was used for meta-analysis when I2 values < 50% and random effect model when I2 values ≥ 50% as heterogeneity indicated. Incomplete outcome data were analyzed by intention to treat analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the difference between random and fixed effects model as to their effect measures such as OR, relative risk (RR), and risk difference (RD). We explored the publication bias by funnel plots (when the number of included studies more than 9) and Egger’s test for continuous endpoints and Harbord’s test for dichotomous endpoints.",
        "The GRADE approach was used to evaluate the quality of evidence of each outcome, which was classified as high, moderate, low, and very low after the all-round assessment of study limitations, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias [26].",
        "Among the 16,977 studies, 27 RCTs [22, 27–54] involving 1186 patients and 1280 limbs were included in our systematic review. The inclusion and exclusion flow was listed in flow Fig. 1.

Patients in the trials were identified as PAD or diabetic foot (DF) with different classifications. Stem cells, including BMMSCs, BMMNCs, BMAC, PBMNC, CD34+ cells, VesCell, PBMCs, and CD133+ cells, were transplanted by intramuscular injection [22, 27–37, 39–51, 53, 54] or intra-arterial injection [28, 38, 52].

But we included nine studies that were not analyzed in the previous systematic review. The study of Tateishi-Yuyama reported two parts of the experiment and one is RCT [22]. The other eight studies [30, 33–35, 37, 44, 45, 53] also met the inclusion criteria in every way but were not included in the previous systematic review. In addition, the previous systematic reviews did secondary analysis including non-RCTs and RCTs, but studies of different designs should not be analyzed in a combined manner. In this case, we believe that our results are more reliable than the previous ones. Besides, we are the first to perform the subgroup analysis for patients with DM who bear the increased risk of PAD, segmental and diffuse arterial disease, and cardiovascular event. Most DM patients are not suitable for surgery or interventional therapy, and they may benefit from stem cell therapy.",
        "Our study showed only one serious side effect related to the implantation of stem cells which shall remind us of the importance of aseptic technique during the injection. Due to the short follow-up, a full understanding of the side effect of stem cell implantation calls for further study. There were some observational studies reporting a serious side effect of stem cell therapy. Horie has reported heart failure, myocardial infarction, severe infection, and stroke post-cell therapy [56]. Moreover, the relationship between the tumor and stem cell therapy remains disputable. Among the 162 patients receiving stem cell implantation in Horie’s study [56], 9 patients had malignant tumor during 24.6 months follow-up. Two patients were diagnosed with a malignant tumor before the study, and the other 7 patients developed a small intestinal tumor, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, gastric cancer, and groin tumor. But this was an observational study and there is no direct cause-and-effect relationship between those events and stem cells therapy. Thus, RCTs of large sample size and longer follow-up time are needed to verify the safety of cell therapy.",
        "There are several limitations in our study. Firstly, most trials have a high or unclear risk of bias so the trials may be underpowered. Low quality of methodology mainly results from inadequate sequence generation, lack of allocation concealment, absent blinding, and incomplete outcome data. Some RCTs mentioned “random” but did not report the specific randomization method. Some RCTs did not use allocation concealment and blinding method. Secondly, several studies had a small sample size and limited information for outcomes, such as adverse events. Thirdly, the included patients, types of stem cells, methods of transplantation, control group, and follow-up time were different among RCTs, which may lead to heterogeneity. The patients in the included studies were identified as having PAD or DF according to a different classification. There were eight types of stem cells including BMMSCs, BMMNCs, BMAC, PBMNC, CD34+ cells, VesCell, PBMCs, and CD133+ cells in our studies. Stem cells were transplanted by intramuscular injection or intra-arterial injection. Besides, the number of stem cells used varied among RCTs and part of studies did not report the number of transplanted stem cells. Stem cells used in the included studies may be the major cause of heterogeneity. Thus, standardization in the transplantation method, stem cell type, and quantity should be valued in transplantation. Treatments in control groups contain non-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells, conventional treatment, and placebo. Follow-up time ranged from 1 to 36 months. These differences lead to great heterogeneity in meta-analysis of ABI, TcO2 and rest pain score. Twenty-seven RCTs included in this study all reported positive results, and we only included studies in English and Chinese, which may lead to publication bias.",
        "The “no-option” patients with PAD may benefit from stem cells therapy, but there was seemingly no significant improvement in major limb salvage. Due to the low-quality evidence, further researches including larger, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials with long-term follow-up of high quality are still in demand to prove the efficacy and safety of stem cells therapy for PAD.",

    "title": "Efficacy and Safety of Autologous Cell-based Therapy in Patients with No-option Critical Limb Ischaemia: A Meta-Analysis. critical limb ischemia (CLI), although a significant proportion of patients with CLI either are not fit for or do not respond well to this procedure. Recently, novel angiogenic therapies such as the use of autologous cellbased therapy (CBT) have been examined, but the results of individual trials were inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To pool all published studies that compared the safety and efficacy of autologous CBT derived from different sources and phenotypes with non cell-based therapy (NCT) in CLI patients. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov from 1974-2017. Sixteen randomised clinical trials (RCTs) involving 775 patients receiving the following interventions: mobilised peripheral blood stem cells(m-PBSC), bone marrow mononuclear cells(BM-MNC), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells(BM-MSC), cultured BM-MNC(Ixmyelocel-T), cultured PB cells(VesCell) and CD34+ cells were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: High-quality evidence (QoE) showed similar all-cause mortality rates between CBT and NCT. AR reduction by approximately 60% were observed in patients receiving CBT compared to NCT (moderate QoE). CBT patients experienced improvement in ulcer healing, ABI, TcO2, pain free walking capacity and collateral vessel formation (moderate QoE). Low-to-moderate QoE showed that compared to NCT, intramuscular BM-MNC and m-PBSC may reduce amputation rate, rest pain, and improve ulcer healing and ankle-brachial pressure index, while intramuscular BM-MSC appeared to improve rest pain, ulcer healing and pain-free walking distance but not AR. Efficacy of other types of CBT could not be confirmed due to limited data. Cell harvesting and implantation appeared safe and well-tolerated with similar rates of adverse-events between groups. CONCLUSION: Implantation of autologous CBT may be an effective therapeutic strategy for no-option CLI patients. BM-MNC and m-PSBC appear more effective than NCT in improving AR and other limb perfusion parameters. BM-MSC may be beneficial in improving perfusion parameters but not AR, however, this observation needs to be confirmed in a larger population of patients. Generally, treatment using various sources and phenotypes of cell products appeared safe and well tolerated. Large-size RCTs with long follow-up are warranted to determine the superiority and durability of angiogenic potential of a particular CBT and the optimal treatment regimen for CLI. epub@benthamscience.org.

      "abstract": "Objectives: The number and quality of endothelial progenitor cells decrease in patients with connective tissue diseases. This limits the efficacy of mononuclear cell therapy for ischemic ulcers associated with connective tissue diseases. To overcome these problems, we developed a serum-free quality and quantity control culture method that potentially improves the function of endothelial progenitor cells and expands their numbers. Here, we show the effect of quality and quantity control culture on mononuclear cells from patients with connective tissue diseases. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from C57BL/6JJmsSlc- lpr/lpr mice with systemic lupus erythematosus, patients with connective tissue diseases, and healthy volunteers. Mononuclear cells were cultured using the quality and quantity control culture method, and the number of endothelial progenitor cells was analyzed using flow cytometry, an endothelial progenitor cell culture assay, and an endothelial progenitor cell colony-forming assay. Flow cytometry was also used to examine mononuclear cell subpopulations. A human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube-forming assay was used to examine the function of quality and quantity control cultured mononuclear cells. Results: Mice with systemic lupus erythematosus showed a significantly lower number of endothelial progenitor cells, which increased to the same levels as those of the control mice after quality and quantity control culture. In humans, the numbers of endothelial progenitor cells and M2 macrophages were significantly increased and the number of proinflammatory cells was decreased after quality and quantity control culture in both healthy volunteers and patients with connective tissue diseases. The human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assay showed higher angiogenic potential in quality and quantity control cultured mononuclear cells from patients with connective tissue diseases than that in quality and quantity control cultured mononuclear cells from healthy controls. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the quality and quantity control culture method is effective in recovering the angiogenic ability of mononuclear cells from patients with connective tissue diseases.",

        "Autologous mononuclear cells (MNCs) have been used for clinical vascular regenerative therapy since the discovery of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) by Asahara et al. in 19971,2). EPCs can differentiate into the endothelium of blood vessels. EPCs are one of the components of the MNCs in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB), which are distinguished by the expression of CD34 and CD133. For regenerative cell therapy using EPCs, MNCs have been harvested from BM or PB treated with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Autologous BM cell therapy and G-CSF-mobilized PB CD34+ cell therapy have been shown to be safe and clinically effective in ischemic diseases2,3). However, autologous EPC therapy is limited for some diseases, such as diabetes and connective tissue diseases (CTDs), because of the lack of the number and angiogenic function of EPCs4-6).",
        "To overcome these problems, a novel technique to promote the angiogenic function of EPCs and to expand their number, which is called serum-free quality and quantity control culture (QQc) method, was developed7). We also reported that the population of EPCs significantly increased in PBMNCs from patients with diabetes and their vasculogenic capability substantially improved through QQc. Moreover, MNC-QQ cells from patients with diabetes promoted wound healing in mice with diabetes8). Phase I and II clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of autologous MNC-QQ cell therapy in patients with diabetes and chronic nonhealing ischemic extremity wounds were conducted from 2014 to 2017. PB (200 mL) was collected from the patients, and 2 × 107 MNC-QQ cells were injected into the area surrounding the ulcer. No death and other serious adverse events were observed during the 12-week follow-up after transplantation. In all 10 cases, vascular perfusion and skin perfusion pressure were increased and pain intensity was decreased9).",
        "Autoimmune diseases and vasculitis account for approximately 20%-23% of refractory chronic wounds10). Because the number of EPCs is decreased and their angiogenic capability is impaired in patients with CTD and in patients with diabetes, QQc could be helpful as an effective cell therapy for limb salvage. Here, we compared the angiogenic potential of MNC-QQ cells from patients with CTD with that of MNC-QQ cells from healthy controls via an in vitro study.",

        "We performed FACS analysis to examine the effects of QQc on cell populations involved in inflammation. The percentage of CD14-positive monocytes or macrophages was significantly higher in MNCs from patients with CTD than in those from healthy controls. This difference was lost because of the slight decrease in the percentage of CD14-positive cells in MNCs from patients with CTD after QQc, whereas there was no change in that from healthy controls. Among the macrophages, the CD206-positive M2 macrophage population was larger in MNCs from patients with CTD than in those from healthy controls, although the difference was not significant. The percentages of CD206-positive cells were significantly increased both in MNCs from healthy controls and in those from patients with CTD after QQc. The percentages of proinflammatory cells, such as CCR2-positive M1 macrophages, CD19-positive B cells, and CD56-positive natural killer (NK) cells, were significantly decreased both in MNCs from healthy controls and in those from patients with CTD after QQc, whereas there were no differences between those from healthy controls and patients with CTD. Although the percentage of angiogenic T cells in MNCs from patients with CTD was likely to be lower than that in MNCs from healthy controls, QQc significantly expanded the population of angiogenic T cells from patients with CTD (Figure 3).",

        "Chronic refractory ulcers often occur in CTDs such as RA, SSc, and SLE. Impaired wound regeneration is mainly caused by poor vasculogenesis, which partly results from the dysfunction of EPCs6,11). In this study, we showed the effect of the QQc method on PBMNCs from patients with CTD. In both mice and humans, after QQc, the percentages of the EPC population both in MNCs from healthy controls and in those from mice with SLE/patients with CTD were significantly increased. Among the total EPC population, the percentages of the definitive EPC-CFUs, which represent mature EPCs and have high vasculogenic potential, were increased after QQc. Consistent with the EPC-CFU assay, in vitro tube formation assays showed the increased angiogenic ability of both MNC-QQ cells from healthy controls and those from patients with CTD conditions compared with those of pre-QQc MNCs.",
        "In mice with SLE, the number and angiogenic function of EPCs in PB were decreased, in agreement with a previous report11). However, there was no significant difference in the number of EPCs in human healthy controls and patients with CTD, although many studies have reported a decrease in the number of EPCs in patients with CTD6,11,12). One reason for this inconsistency would be that we included patients with CTD with a variety of disease levels and medications in this study. Grisar et al.13) reported the effects of medication and activity on circulating angiogenic cells in patients with RA. They found that the number of EPCs was much lower in patients with active RA than in those with inactive RA or those receiving antitumor necrosis factor therapy13,14). Thus, the EPC-expanding effects of QQc on patients in the active stage of CTD remain to be seen in the future.",
        "Our results showed a tendency for a reduction in angiogenic T cells in CTD MNCs compared with healthy MNCs, whereas no significant difference in EPC percentage was found between them. Similar to EPCs, the number of angiogenic T cells is also known to be decreased in patients with RA15). Angiogenic T cells are a subset of T cells that enhance endothelial function by cooperating with EPCs. The decrease in the number of angiogenic T cells and higher levels of IFN alpha in patients with CTD were reported to be associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular events15), and this association might be mediated by an impaired endothelial repair mechanism. QQc increased the percentage of angiogenic T cells in MNCs from patients with CTD to a level similar to that observed in those from healthy controls. These results also show the promising applicability of potentially angiogenic MNC-QQ cells harvested from patients with CTD.",
        "M2 macrophages are anti-inflammatory macrophages that are important in wound healing. We showed that the number of CD206-positive cells, which represent M2 macrophages, was slightly increased in PBMNCs from patients with CTD than in those from healthy controls. Some reports have demonstrated an increase in the number of CD14-positive monocytes/macrophages and M2 macrophages in patients with CTD16-18). The number of M2 macrophages was significantly increased after QQc, whereas the numbers of immune system cells, CD56-positive NK cells, CD19-positive B cells, and proinflammatory CCR2-positive M1 macrophages were decreased. These results suggest that QQc could also contribute to the creation of an anti-inflammatory environment in MNC transplantation therapy.",
        "In this study, we only performed an in vitro analysis of MNC-QQ cells obtained from patients with CTD. The wound healing and angiogenic effects of MNC-QQ cells from healthy mice and mice with diabetes mellitus in vitro and in vivo were previously reported7,8,19). Recently, phase I and IIa clinical trials were conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of autologous MNC-QQ cell therapy in patients with chronic nonhealing ischemic extremity wounds9). In these trials, two patients with SSc were included and MNC-QQ cell transplantation improved vascular perfusion and pain in patients with SSc as effectively as it did in other patients with diabetes mellitus. Thus, we believe that MNC-QQ cell therapy serves as a noninvasive and effective therapy for collagen tissue diseases with refractory chronic ulcers.",
        "This study had some limitations. First, the number of participants with CTD was small and the study included patients with various diseases, such as RA and SLE. As far as we could obtain information, most patients were well controlled with medication. Thus, further analysis with a larger number of participants is required to determine the effects of QQc methods on each type and pathological stage of CTDs. Second, we only performed in vitro analyses. Although we confirmed that there was no difference in the cell population and the angiogenic potential of MNC-QQ cells between healthy controls and patients with CTD, the in vivo function of MNC-QQ cells in CTD model mice should be examined in more detail in the future.",

        "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that represents an increasing public health issue worldwide, affecting 1–18% of the population in different countries [1]. It is characterized by airflow obstruction with airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness [2]. Most patients with asthma achieve disease control with a combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists (LABAs). However, a substantial proportion of patients with severe asthma are unresponsive to these treatments, experiencing unsuccessful control of their symptoms, pulmonary exacerbations, and accelerated deterioration of lung function [1, 2].",
        "A growing body of evidence suggests that cell-based therapies hold therapeutic promise for patients with lung diseases. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMCs) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), administered either locally or systemically, have yielded favorable therapeutic outcomes in a wide spectrum of experimental models [3–5]. In animal models of allergic asthma, cell-based therapies reduced airway inflammation and remodeling significantly, thus improving lung function [4, 6–11]. Furthermore, we previously found that in a model of ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma, BMMCs induced better therapeutic responses compared to MSCs in some endpoint assessments, including reduction of alveolar collapse area and collagen fiber content in lung tissue [10]. Autologous BMMCs can also be transplanted on the same day of harvesting, thus avoiding additional costs related to cell culture procedures and potential host-recipient mismatch complications, such as graft-versus-host disease.",
        "In early-stage clinical studies, BMMC therapy demonstrated a safety profile in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, ischemic stroke, or silicosis [12–14]. We described three patients with severe asthma unresponsive to conventional treatment (corticosteroids, LABA, muscarinic antagonists) and omalizumab who received autologous transplantation of BMMCs intravenously. These patients were followed up periodically for 1 year after the procedure. Endpoint assessments included physical examination, quality of life (QoL) questionnaires, imaging (computed tomography (CT), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and ventilation/perfusion scan), lung function tests, and a 6-min walk test (6MWT). BMMCs were characterized on the basis of a fibroblast colony-forming assay and expression of specific surface antigens by flow cytometry analysis.",
        "Patients were recruited from the Severe Asthma Reference Center at the Institute of Thoracic Diseases, Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital (HUCFF), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil. All patients were investigated and treated in accordance with the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines [1]. The patients also received standard care according to the institutional protocol of the HUCFF/UFRJ Pulmonary Division, before and after autologous transplantation of BMMCs. The study protocol and informed consent form were approved by the Brazilian National Research Ethics Committee (CONEP; study ID number: 06503212.3.0000.5257).",
        "Ten patients with severe asthma were initially screened for eligibility. The inclusion criteria were (1) age between 18 and 65 years; (2) uncontrolled asthma despite maximum therapy in the previous 6 months, as recommended by the GINA guidelines [1]; (3) unresponsiveness to immunobiological therapy with omalizumab; (4) a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) < 80% on spirometry and a bronchodilator response at any time; and (5) informed consent to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria were (1) an infectious episode in the 4 weeks preceding enrollment; (2) other lung diseases, including active tuberculosis; (3) current or recent smoking (within 12 months of inclusion), characterized by tobacco intake greater than 10 pack-years; (4) any malignant neoplasm; (5) autoimmune diseases; (6) hematologic or cardiovascular diseases; (7) seropositivity for the human immunodeficiency virus; (8) pregnancy; and (9) participation in any other clinical trial. Based on these criteria, three women were included in the study.",
        "The bone marrow was aspirated under local anesthesia from the posterior iliac crest as previously described [12, 13]. BMMCs were isolated by density gradient on Ficoll-Paque at 400×g for 30 min (Ficoll-Paque Plus 1.077, 1:2, Amersham Biosciences, São Paulo, Brazil), washed twice in saline, and resuspended in saline solution with 10% autologous serum. After washing and counting, a total of 2 × 107 cells were labeled with technetium-99m (99mTc) for tracking after infusion, as described elsewhere [12, 13]. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test before and after labeling and was estimated to be greater than 93% in all cases. All procedures for cell preparation and labeling were carried out under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood. Bacteriological analyses and cultures were also performed to exclude any contamination of the specimens.",
        "Total bone marrow and BMMCs were characterized by flow cytometry using specific surface antigens. Briefly, cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with primary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), allophycocyanin (APC), peridinin chlorophyll protein (PercP), phycoerythrin cyano 5 (PE-Cy5), and phycoerythrin cyano 7 (PE-Cy7). After staining, erythrocytes were lysed with BD (Becton Dickinson) FACS Lysing Solution. Data acquisition was performed on a FACS ARIA II (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer and analyzed in Infinicity software (Cytognos, Spain).

        "A fibroblast colony-forming assay was performed to determine the presence of putative progenitor cells of mesenchymal lineages. After Ficoll-Paque centrifugation, mononuclear cells were counted and plated in triplicate in a 6-well plate. A total of 2 × 106 cells was cultured in each well using high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 10−6 M hydrocortisone. After plating, cells were maintained in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 1 week without any manipulation. Then, 50% of the medium was replaced and cells were maintained under the same conditions for an additional week. At the end of this protocol, cells were stained with Giemsa and colonies were counted.",
        "A 20-mL aliquot of the autologous BMMC solution (2 × 107 cells labeled with 99mTc) was injected into a peripheral vein of the upper arm of each patient. After the procedure, patients were monitored for 1 h and then transferred to the Nuclear Medicine Department for further analyses. Whole-body, planar, and tomographic scintigraphy was carried out 2 h after BMMC transplantation. For regional analysis in both the anterior (A) and posterior (P) images, rectangular regions of interest, equal in size, were drawn over the whole lung. Both lungs had six regions of interest: right upper, right middle, right lower, left upper, left middle, and left lower lung fields. Regional blood flow was evaluated by 99mTc macroaggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA) perfusion scintigraphy in each area of interest and calculated as previously described [15]. Patients were followed for a further 12 months after BMMC transplantation.",
        "Patient demographics, medical history, vital signs, routine laboratory tests (blood counts, coagulation tests, biochemical measurements, liver function tests), electrocardiogram, the Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale, and the 6-min walk test (6MWT) were assessed using standardized clinical report forms. Lung function tests, including spirometry, lung CT scans, and ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy, were also performed. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed with the Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) [16], which is a standardized set of self-report measures for assessment of impaired health and perceived well-being in patients with lung diseases. Measurements were performed before BMMC transplantation (baseline) and at 7, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 360 days after the procedure.",

        "Patient 1 was a 50-year-old woman (height 1.55 m, weight 82 kg, BMI 34.1 kg m-2) with severe steroid-dependent allergic asthma who demonstrated no therapeutic response to omalizumab. The patient had never smoked. Disease onset had occurred in early childhood, with remission from age 15–25. The patient had a history of severe pulmonary exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy, despite regular treatment with high-dose oral and inhaled corticosteroids and LABA. In August 2015, the patient underwent bone marrow aspiration and received a single dose of autologous BMMCs intravenously. Measured variables were performed before treatment and periodically up to 1 year after BMMC transplantation (Table 3). Whole-body 99mTc-BMMC scintigraphy was performed 2 h after administration and demonstrated a normal biodistribution of labeled cells, with greater uptake in the liver, lungs (especially the right), heart, blood pool, kidneys, and bladder (Fig. 2). Over the following days, the patient experienced improvement of respiratory symptoms but developed sinus tachycardia, requiring a reduction in LABA dose. A mild increase in ventilation of all zones of the right lung was also observed 120 days after BMMC transplantation. Asthma control was successfully achieved with half of the prior dose of inhaled corticosteroids and LABA for up to 12 months after BMMC transplantation. Self-perceived QoL score significantly improved on day 7 after the procedure and remained steady over 1 year of follow-up (Fig. 3). Lung function and 6MWD measurements remained stable throughout.\nFig. 2Imaging of patients 1 (upper panel) and 2 (lower panel). a, e Whole-body (WB) scintigraphy 2 h after intravenous administration of 99mTc-BMMCs.

        "Patient 2 was a 58-year-old woman (height 1.53 m, weight 75 kg, BMI 32.0 kg m-2) with severe steroid-dependent allergic asthma who also failed to respond to omalizumab. Disease onset had occurred in early childhood; there had been no remission. The patient had mild bronchiectasis without chronic infection and had never smoked. IgE testing for Aspergillus fumigatus was negative on multiple occasions. The patient was on regular high-dose oral and inhaled corticosteroids plus LABA and had a history of multiple hospital admissions due to pulmonary exacerbations. In November 2015, bone marrow aspiration was performed, and the patient received a single dose of autologous BMMCs intravenously and was periodically followed for a year (Table 3). Corticosteroids and LABA were continued. Whole-body 99mTc-BMMC scintigraphy performed 2 h after cell infusion demonstrated a normal biodistribution of labeled cells, with greater uptake in the liver, lungs, heart, blood pool, kidneys, and bladder (Fig. 2). Thirty days after the procedure, asthma control was achieved, and the patient demonstrated better exercise tolerance as well as a reduction in corticosteroid requirements. During the following months, the patient had three pulmonary exacerbations, each requiring an increase in the dose of oral corticosteroids and prescription of antibiotics. No significant changes in ventilation or perfusion from baseline were observed on day 120 post-BMMC transplantation. Over the 1-year follow-up period, her asthma remained partially controlled. Lung function, 6MWD, and self-perceived QoL score improved slightly up to 30 days after BMMC transplantation (Table 3, Fig. 3). On day 60, these parameters declined, which remained stable thereafter.",
        "Patient 3 was a 58-year-old woman (height 1.58 m, weight 56 kg, BMI 22.4 kg m-2) with severe non-allergic asthma. Disease onset occurred at age 47; the patient had never smoked. She had dyspnea with minimal exertion despite regular treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, LABA, and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist. Severe obstruction was also observed on spirometry, with a positive bronchodilator test. In December 2016, the patient underwent bone marrow aspiration and received a single dose of autologous BMMCs intravenously. Lung function remained stable throughout the follow-up period. Asthma control, QoL score, and 6MWD improved slightly over the first 30 days after BMMC transplantation and remained stable up to day 180 (Table 3, Fig. 3). Thereafter, a mild increase in breathlessness was reported, but without the need to change baseline treatments. At 1-year follow-up, asthma symptoms were partially controlled, and both self-perceived QoL and 6MWD had improved from baseline.",
        "In the first trimester of 2020, all patients were alive, with a significant reduction in the number of hospital admissions during their respective follow-up periods compared to before BMMC transplantation. Patient 2 had a pneumonia episode in 2019, however, recovered well. More recently, both patients 1 and 2 were using only an oral inhalation solution of formoterol fumarate plus budesonide, while patient 3 was using two oral inhalation solutions (formoterol fumarate/beclometasone and tiotropium bromide).",
        "This case series describes the effects of a single intravenous dose of autologous BMMCs in three patients with severe asthma. The procedure was well tolerated, and no adverse events related to BMMC transplantation were observed during 1-year follow-up. Although these patients had heterogenous clinical features and signs at baseline, no significant changes were found in lung function tests after BMMC transplantation. Nevertheless, patients 1 and 3 experienced an improvement in self-perceived QoL score in the early post-procedure course, which remained stable throughout the follow-up period. Patient 2 also exhibited an improvement in self-perceived QoL in the early course after BMMC transplantation; however, this patient had a pulmonary exacerbation episode, which resulted in the worsening of QoL scores on day 60, remaining stable thereafter up to day 180. Total bone marrow cells and BMMCs of all patients were characterized using a defined panel of phenotypic markers. Furthermore, the functional characterization of fibroblastic-like cells was confirmed by the presence of putative progenitor cells of mesenchymal lineages.",
        "Preclinical data have demonstrated the great potential of cell-based therapies in modulating inflammatory parameters, including recruitment and polarization of immune cells and production of cytokines/chemokines and growth factors [3–5]. Although MSC administration has been more extensively investigated for a wide range of diseases, we specifically evaluated the effects of BMMC transplantation in patients with severe asthma, as these cells were associated with greater reduction in lung tissue abnormalities and fibrosis in a murine model of ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma [10]. Furthermore, in a model Aspergillus hyphal extract-induced allergic asthma, reduction in inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness was triggered by CD11b+ (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells) and Sca-1+ (MSCs) cells present in the pool of BMMCs. Such findings demonstrated that therapeutic effects were resulting from the balance between cell types rather than strictly from MSCs [6]. Autologous BMMCs can also be administered on the same day of harvesting, thus preventing further costs related to cell culture procedures and potential complications of human leukocyte antigen mismatch. A peripheral vein was used for BMMC transplantation, since the procedure could be easily performed without the need of intubation for bronchoscopy. Intravenous administration has demonstrated a good safety profile for delivery of either BMMCs or MSCs in experimental models [6, 7, 9, 17–20]. Even though a systemic route was used in the cases described herein, these cells are efficiently delivered to the lungs as they are subject to a first-pass effect [21].",
        "The best cell dosing strategy to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes in respiratory diseases is still unknown, and only a few dose-escalation clinical trials have been performed to date [3–5]. We used a fixed dose of 2 × 107 BMMCs per patient, regardless of body weight; this dose was selected on the basis of clinical studies previously evaluating the safety and feasibility of BMMCs in patients with silicosis or ischemic stroke [12, 13]. Moreover, we aspirated the volume of the bone marrow (~ 150 mL) from which the maximum number of cells was harvested and injected. During the follow-up period, one patient demonstrated early improvement in self-perception of QoL, followed by a pulmonary exacerbation episode some months later, which resulted in a decline in QoL score. These adverse events were most likely related to disease progression and severity, as this patient already had a history of multiple hospital admissions due to pulmonary exacerbations. The remaining two patients demonstrated improvement in QoL score which remained throughout the study, although no therapeutic effects on lung function were noted. The safety profile found in this early-stage study is encouraging for future evaluations of whether administration of increasing doses of BMMCs may result in improved lung function without eliciting adverse effects in patients with severe asthma. Furthermore, a single dose of either BMMCs or MSCs has demonstrated therapeutic effects in experimental studies, but repeated cell-based therapy yielded greater effects—either by preventing disease progression or by further mitigating inflammation and remodeling—in animal models of silicosis, elastase-induced emphysema, and house dust mite-induced allergic asthma [7, 22, 23]. Future large-scale trials should be conducted to comparatively determine the potential efficacy of single-dose versus repeated cell-based therapy in patients with severe asthma.",
        "To track BMMCs after systemic administration, cells were labeled with 99mTc. This radioisotope has a short half-life (approximately 6 h) but allows efficient cell labeling for early-course tracking after administration, as well as a lower radiation burden for BMMCs and patients compared to other isotopes [13, 24, 25]. Although the chemical compounds used in labeling may cause cell damage, regardless of which technique is used, we did not observe any significant reduction in either BMMC or MSC viability in previous experimental and clinical studies using 99mTc [12, 17, 18, 20]. Two hours after systemic administration of 99mTc-BMMCs, these cells were localized in several organs, but a considerable uptake was observed in the lungs, possibly due to circulating chemoattractant mediators and first-pass effects. It remains to be elucidated whether and for how long BMMCs would persist in the lungs and other organs, as therapeutic effects of cell-based therapy in experimental models have been attributable to paracrine/endocrine actions without the need of cell engraftment [3–5].",
        "No deaths or adverse events related to BMMC transplantation occurred during the procedure, nor during the follow-up period. Patients 1 and 3 reported improvement in QoL scores in the early post-procedure course, and their clinical features remained stable over 1-year follow-up. Although lung function and 6MWT did not improve significantly, a mild increase in ventilation of the right lung was observed in patient 1 120 days after BMMC transplantation. Interestingly, this patient also exhibited better baseline lung function values, which suggests that therapeutic outcomes might differ depending on disease severity during and after the intervention.",
        "Our group is the first evaluating the effects of a single dose of BMMCs in patients with severe asthma. Limitations of this study include the small sample size, lack of a placebo-controlled, randomized design, and measurements of inflammatory biomarkers. Furthermore, as our primary aim was to evaluate the safety of a single dose of BMMCs, the design was underpowered for efficacy. Although a 1-year follow-up period is not long enough to enable definitive conclusions, the safety profile of BMMC transplantation observed herein is encouraging to pursue large-scale clinical trials in patients with severe asthma.",
        "A single intravenous dose of autologous BMMCs appears to be safe and improves self-perceived QoL in the early course after the procedure. These results provide a basis for subsequent clinical investigations of BMMCs or even other cell types in patients with severe asthma.",

        "Hemoglobinopathies are inherited blood disorders characterized by defective synthesis of hemoglobin (Hb) chains or by the synthesis of mutated globin variants, such as the βA-E6V causing sickle-cell diseases (SCD). Approximately 5% of the world population carries a Hb disorder trait, making hemoglobinopathies the most frequent monogenic diseases worldwide.1 The only therapy for β-thalassemia and SCD is allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell (HSC) transplantation from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donors.2 Matched unrelated or mismatched HSC transplants carry unacceptable risks of morbidity and mortality, given the current high standards of care. Transplantation of autologous, genetically corrected HSCs is a potential therapeutic alternative, carrying lower transplant-related risks and theoretically being available to all patients. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced by lentiviral vectors (LVs) have been used in clinical trials of gene therapy for immunodeficiencies and lysosomal storage disorders, providing strong evidence of safety and long-term efficacy in most cases.3 In particular. LVs showed relatively safe integration patterns in the human genome and appeared to cause little interference with normal gene regulation and no significant alterations in the homeostasis of the hematopoietic system.4–6",
        "Gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies is more challenging. Regulation of globin gene expression is sophisticated and relies on the interaction of gene promoters with a locus-control region (LCR) that promotes high-level, erythroid-restricted transcription and controls the developmental switch of embryonic to fetal to adult globin gene expression.7,8 The combination of a full LCR and a complete β-globin gene is too large to fit in an LV: current vectors feature size-reduced LCR and non-coding portions of the β-globin gene but remain complex and transduce HSPCs less efficiently compared to simpler vectors, conflicting with the need to engraft a high proportion of transduced HSCs in the patient's bone marrow (BM). The clinical history of allogeneic HSC transplantation indicates that stable mixed chimerism with as low as 10–30% donor HSCs leads to significant amelioration of both β-thalassemia and SCD pathology, providing predictions about the minimal level of gene-corrected HSCs that may achieve clinical benefit.9–11 Recent gene therapy clinical trials are confirming these predictions, although the reduced output of a vector-borne transgene with respect to the natural β-globin locus significantly increases the minimal chimerism levels necessary to achieve efficacy, particularly in the case of SCD.12–14 Innovation in HSC procurement, transduction, and transplantation technology will likely increase the overall efficacy of gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies in the near future.",
        "The first β-globin LVs were developed almost 20 years ago. They contained a β-globin gene under the control of the its promoter and 3′ enhancer elements in addition to the DNase I hypersensitive sites 2, 3, and 4 (HS2, HS3, and HS4) of the β-globin LCR.15,16 These vectors, termed TNS9 and HPV569, expressed levels of β-globin that were sufficient to correct murine models of β-thalassemia15,17,18 and SCD.16 The GLOBE vector had a different design, lacking the HS4 and the 3′ enhancer and featuring an extended HS2 and an HS3 element. This vector showed improved infectivity compared to vectors containing the HS4 and was equally efficacious in correcting murine β-thalassemia19 and reducing globin chain imbalance in erythroblasts from β-thalassemic patients.20 All globin vectors transduce long-term repopulating HSCs and combine the low genotoxic properties of LVs with the strict lineage specificity of the β-globin promoter, enhancer, and LCR.21",
        "Attempts to increase globin gene expression by introducing larger HS fragments or adding the LCR HS1 element in the LV provided at best modest improvements.22,23 Other investigators added chromatin “insulators,” such as the chicken β-globin HS422,24 or a synthetic element (FB) containing sequences from the chicken HS4 and the T-cell receptor BEAD-1 insulator, in an attempt to prevent repressive influence of surrounding chromatin on the integrated vector or reduce potential cis-acting influences of the LCR enhancers on neighboring genes.25,26 Unfortunately, these elements reduced transduction efficiency and caused genetic instability. In the first patient who received gene therapy for β-thalassemia, the chicken HS4 enhancer in the BGI vector contained a cryptic signal that triggered abnormal splicing of the proto-oncogene HMG2A and a benign clonal dominance.12 The element was removed for further clinical development.27 Other attempts to introduce chromatin remodeling elements, such as HS elements derived from the GATA-1 transcription factor gene28 or the ankyrin gene insulator,29,30 did improve vector expression features, indicating that combinations of erythroid-specific transcriptional regulatory elements may lead to more efficacious globin LVs. Nevertheless, the vectors currently in clinical development, such as BB30521 and GLOBE,19 contain just the essential promoter and LCR elements of the β-globin gene.",
        "While a simple gene-replacement strategy may be sufficient to correct β-thalassemia, vectors aimed at correcting SCD must express globins able to compete with the βS-chain for α-chains and therefore interfere with Hb polymerization. The design of anti-sickling globins is based on genetic knowledge. SCD patients with elevated levels of fetal Hb (HbF), due to association with a hereditary persistence of HbF (HPFH) trait, experience less severe symptoms.31,32 The protective activity of HbF is due to the polymerization-inhibiting properties of γ-globin chains, which are able to inhibit sickling. Accordingly, LVs containing a γ-globin or a hybrid β-promoter/γ-globin gene efficiently corrected a murine model of SCD.33,34 Some investigators developed β-globins carrying mutations that interfere with axial and lateral contacts in the HbS polymer, with potent anti-sickling properties.35 The BB305 vector expresses one of these mutants, the βA-T87Q globin, and is able to reduce sickling in a murine model of SCD.16 Another such mutant, the AS3 globin, carries three mutations—T87Q, G16D, and E22A—which further reduce polymerization while increasing the affinity for the α-chain.36 The βAS3-FB vector, which expresses AS3 globin, corrects murine SCD37 and reduces sickling in the erythroid progeny of CD34+ progenitors from SCD patients.26,38 The BB305 and βAS3-FB vectors are currently in clinical development for gene therapy of SCD.",
        "Beta thalassemia is caused by mutations that reduce (β+) or abolish (β0) the synthesis of β-globin chains,39 resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis, intramedullary hemolysis, and hemolytic anemia. Clinical severity is variable and depends on the combination of different β0 or β+ mutations. The association with α-thalassemia or elevated HbF levels cause milder clinical phenotypes.40,41 Patients with severe β-thalassemia present with anemia, iron overload, hepatosplenomegaly, and skeletal abnormalities due to the BM expansion. Complications include cardiopathy, hepatic dysfunction, and endocrine disorders, which occur at various ages, depending on disease severity and adequacy of the transfusion and iron chelation treatment.42 At present, the only cure for β-thalassemia is allogeneic HSC transplantation from HLA-identical donors, with implies high-dose chemotherapy and immunosuppression.43 Transplantation with HSCs from a matched sibling donor results in >80% disease-free survival and 3–10% mortality on long-term follow-up,2,44,45 but is limited by a donor availability of <30%.46 Transplants from matched unrelated donors result in reduced disease-free survival and increased mortality,47 while haploidentical transplantation carries unacceptably high risks. Chronic graft-versus-host disease, infections, and the toxicity associated with BM conditioning are common side effects of allogeneic HSC transplantation and affect both quality of life and survival. Gene therapy is theoretically available to all patients and, due to the autologous origin of the transplanted cells, is associated with reduced toxicity and treatment-related morbidity.",
        "The traditional sources of stem cells for gene therapy are BM or peripheral blood mobilized CD34+ HSPCs. Mobilization has essentially replaced BM harvest due to higher yield of CD34+ cells, faster engraftment, enhanced immune reconstitution, and shorter hospitalization. The issue of HSC procurement is critical, since the minimal target dose of CD34+ (usually >5 × 106 cells/kg) is difficult to obtain by BM harvesting. Mobilization in the peripheral blood by administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) provides adequate doses of CD34+ HSPCs in most conditions but may be risky in β-thalassemia patients.48 An alternative agent is Plerixafor (AMD3100; Mozobil™), a bicyclam molecule that antagonizes the binding of stromal cell-derived factor 1 to the chemokine CXC-receptor-4, causing mobilization of HSPCs in the peripheral circulation.49 The use of Plerixafor in combination with G-CSF is currently approved in the United States and Europe for adult and pediatric populations.50 Plerixafor, or G-CSF + Plerixafor, safely mobilizes adequate numbers of HSCs in β-thalassemia patients.51–53 Plerixafor alone mobilizes HSCs with superior stem-cell characteristics, although with a somewhat lower yield compared to the association with G-CSF.54 In the currently used protocols, mobilized CD34+ cell populations are transduced by LVs and readministered to patients by intravenous or intrabone infusion. Adequate cell doses and clonal diversity of engrafted cells are necessary to reconstitute hematopoiesis rapidly and completely after transplantation, requiring high transduction efficiency and fully myeloablative conditioning regimens. The morbidity associated with conditioning is reduced in gene therapy compared to allogeneic HSC transplantation, since immune suppression is not required in an autologous setting.",
        "The potential efficacy of HSC transduced with β-globin LVs in correcting the β-thalassemia phenotype was proven in murine models of the disease, starting from a pioneering study in 2000.15,18,19,55–57 Interestingly, one of these studies showed an in vivo survival advantage for genetically corrected erythroblasts in a murine β-thalassemia model,19 predicting that even suboptimal doses or transduced HSC may provide clinical benefit in patients. The potential genotoxicity of the currently used BB305 and GLOBE vectors was tested more recently in rigorous studies that fully supported clinical application.21,58 Clinical development of gene therapy started in 2007 with the transplantation of HSCs transduced by the BGI LV expressing the βT87Q globin in a patient affected by transfusion-dependent HbE/β-thalassemia.12 The HbE trait mimics a mild β+ allele and reduces the requirement for therapeutic β-globin synthesis. The patient received myeloablative busulfan conditioning, experienced a gradual increase in gene-marked cells up to 10–20%, and became transfusion independent with stable Hb levels of 8.5–9 g/dL 1 year after gene therapy. The mutant HbA, HbF, and HbE contributed almost equally to the therapeutic Hb levels.12 Interestingly, the synthesis of therapeutic globin was largely accounted for by the expansion of a single stem/progenitor cell clone in which the LV integrated into the HMGA2 proto-oncogene. The benign dominant clone persisted for almost 9 years, before declining to <10% of the circulating nucleated cells. The patient currently maintains stable levels of therapeutic Hb and requires only occasional transfusion (M. Cavazzana, unpublished observations). This pilot study proved the efficacy of gene therapy for β-thalassemia, but also indicated the requirement of an abundant, polyclonal population of transduced HSCs for significant and long-lasting clinical benefit. A clinical trial carried out in the United States using partially myeloablative conditioning showed minimal clinical benefit, confirming the requirement for full myeloablation for efficient engraftment of genetically corrected HSCs.59",
        "Two subsequent clinical trials addressing transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia started in 2013 in the United States, Australia, Thailand, and France based on the use of the BB305 vector. At a median follow-up of 26 months, all but one of the 13 patients with a non β0/β0 thalassemia genotype had discontinued red cell transfusions and remained transfusion-independent with levels of total Hb of 8.2–13.7 g/dL, of which the therapeutic HbAT87Q accounted for 3.4–10 g/dL. In nine patients with β0/β0 or severe β+/β+ (homozygous IVS1-110 mutation) genotypes, the median annualized transfusion volume decreased by 73%, and transfusions were discontinued in three patients. The treatment was well tolerated, with no severe adverse event related to gene transfer. Vector integration analysis showed polyclonal hematopoietic reconstitution and no evidence of vector-related clonal dominance.14 These studies proved the safety and remarkable efficiency of LV-mediated gene therapy in reducing or eliminating the transfusion dependence in β-thalassemia patients.",
        "Mobilization of HSPCs with Plerixafor + G-CSF was introduced in a Phase I/II clinical trial carried out in Italy addressing transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia. The study included three cohorts of adult (≥18 years; n = 3), adolescent (8–17 years; n = 3), and pediatric (3–7 years; n = 4) subjects. Mobilized CD34+ cells were transduced with the GLOBE vector and administered by intra-osseous injection in the posterior-superior iliac crests after myeloablative conditioning with treosulfan and thiotepa, with the rationale of favoring homing and engraftment.60 As of March 2018, nine patients with different genotypes (β0/β0, β+/β+, and β0/β+) were treated, and the procedure was well tolerated, with no treatment-related adverse events. All tested patients showed multilineage cell engraftment and no evidence of clonal abnormality. Transfusion requirement was significantly reduced in the three adult patients, while three out of four evaluable pediatric participants discontinued transfusions and remained transfusion independent, with a follow-up of >12 months.61",
        "Overall, the clinical trials (see list in Table 1) showed that clinical efficacy is directly correlated with gene transfer efficiency and the dose of genetically corrected HSCs and inversely correlated with the Hb synthesis requirement, where β0 mutations are more difficult to correct than β+ ones. Clinical efficacy also correlated with the average proviral copy number in transduced cells, and therefore with the overall output of therapeutic β-globin. In all trials, cell manufacturing appeared to be a critical factor, where continuous improvements in transduction conditions will play a major role in increasing efficacy and make gene therapy the treatment of choice for β-thalassemia patients.",
        "Active gene therapy clinical trials for β-thalassemia",
        "SCD is caused by a mutation (E6V) in the β-globin chain that induces polymerization of Hb tetramers upon deoxygenation. Hb polymers cause erythrocytes to adopt the characteristic sickle shape that reduces their flexibility in the capillary circulation, causing ischemia, multi-organ damage, severe pain, hemolytic anemia, and stroke, significantly shortening the patients' life-span.7,62 Current treatments include periodical transfusion and administration of hydroxyurea, which moderately increases HbF synthesis.62,63 Also for SCD, the only definitive treatment is allogeneic HSC transplantation from matched related donors, with a reported >90% disease-free survival over 6 years.2 However, HSC transplantation is not frequently performed in SCD patients, given the toxicity and potential sterility associated with conditioning and the difficulty in finding suitable donors. As for β-thalassemia, gene therapy is a less toxic therapeutic option potentially available to all patients, though cell procurement and engraftment is even more challenging in the case of SCD.",
        "Preclinical studies showed that LV-based gene therapy is potentially efficacious in reducing sickling. The vectors used in these studies contained the same combination of β-globin promoter and LCR elements used for β-thalassemia, and express anti-sickling globins such as the fetal γ-globin,33,34 the βT87Q,16 or the βAS326,37,38 mutants. As for β-thalassemia, allogeneic HSC transplantation showed that stable mixed chimerism with donor HSC levels of 20–30% is sufficient to achieve significant hematologic and clinical improvement.9–11 Combined with the evidence that the association of SCD and HPFH results in a milder phenotype, these data predict that engraftment of >20% of HSC producing RBCs with >30% anti-sickling Hb levels could improve symptoms and reduce transfusion requirement.",
        "Clinical development of gene therapy for SCD started with a first patient treated in France, with transplantation of CD34+ HSPCs transduced with the BB305 vector expressing the βA-T87Q globin at a dose of 5 × 106 cells/kg and an average vector copy number (VCN) of 1 after full myeloablative conditioning. The patient rapidly reconstituted a polyclonal hematopoiesis, achieved transfusion independence with a level of βA-T87Q globin of ∼50%, and experienced no treatment-related adverse event over a 2-year follow-up.13 These results prompted the initiation of two clinical trials in France and the United States on severe SCD patients. However, the multicenter U.S. trial failed to reproduce the success of the first patient. The first seven patients treated received a median dose of 2 × 106 CD34+ BM-derived HSPCs, with a median VCN of 0.6. A follow-up of 8–17 months showed a VCN in the peripheral blood of <0.12, HbAT87Q levels of <2 g/dL, and an average HbAT87Q/HbS ratio of <15%.64 These results showed that mobilization and robust engraftment of transduced HSCs is more difficult to achieve in SCD than in β-thalassemia patients. Cell dose, transduction efficiency, and engraftment are apparently limiting factors in achieving the minimal HSC chimerism and synthesis of anti-sickling Hb in erythroblasts predicted to provide clinical benefit.",
        "Harvesting CD34+ cells is a risky procedure in SCD patients, which often fails to provide an adequate cell dose. In this regard, the BM microenvironment appears to be a critical factor. Capillary occlusion caused by sickling leads to ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress,65 which compromise the quality of the HSC niche and impact on both harvest and re-engraftments of HSCs. Attempts to mobilize HSCs by low doses of G-CSF caused severe adverse events and at least one fatality, and was therefore abandoned.66 A Plerixafor-only mobilization trial recently completed in France proved the safety of the drug in an SCD context and provided an estimate of the yield of CD34+ HSPCs in both adult and juvenile patients.67 Plerixafor mobilization has been recently implemented in the ongoing gene therapy clinical trials (see list in Table 2). A better cell quality and dose, together with ongoing innovation in cell manufacturing to increase transduction efficiency, should rapidly improve the clinical outcome of gene therapy for SCD.",

        "A limitation of the ex vivo gene therapy approach for hemoglobinopathies is the complex, difficult, and very expensive cell manufacturing step. Administering a globin vector directly in vivo would make gene therapy easier to perform and more feasible in less favored country, where cost and complexity represent formidable barrier to patient access. Approaches based on the use of capsid-modified adenovirus vectors and the integration-promoting machinery of the Sleeping Beauty transposon have been recently published68 and may represent a promising alternative to LVs to integrate a β-globin expression cassette in repopulating stem cells directly into the BM.",
        "Gene editing has recently emerged as a potential alternative to vector-mediated gene addition for gene therapy of β-hemoglobinopathies. Editing the βS mutation by homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) may be achieved by using zinc-finger nucleases or CRISPR/Cas9 to cleave the βS locus and viral genomes or single-stranded oligonucleotides as HDR donor templates. Correction of the βS mutation can be obtained in CD34+ HSPCs with remarkable efficiency, achieving potentially therapeutic HbA/HbS ratios in the erythroid progeny of edited cells differentiated in vitro or in vivo in NOD SCID gamma mice.69–72",
        "An alternative strategy aims at reactivating HbF synthesis in adult erythroblasts. A first approach is based on downregulating BCL11A, a transcription factor involved in silencing γ-globin expression in adult erythroblasts.73,74 Downregulating BCL11A by restricted expression of an shRNA in the erythroid compartment after delivery to HSCs by a GLOBE-like vector is a potentially efficacious strategy75 that recently entered clinical investigation (see Table 2). Fine modulation of the shRNA is, however, necessary, since BCL11A is essential for HSC and lymphoid cell development76 and may be required for RBC enucleation.77 Alternatively, BCL11A can be down-modulated by deleting the erythroid-specific enhancers controlling its erythrocyte-restricted expression by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing.78,79 A second approach is based on recreating genomic deletions or mutations in the β-globin locus associated with HPFH,7,32 leading to increased γ-globin expression80–82 although with sub-therapeutic efficiency compared to LV-mediated gene replacement. This strategy is less complex than editing the βS mutation, since it relies on non-homologous end joining, the dominant DNA repair pathway in HSPCs,69,83 and does not require delivering a DNA template. A more creative approach is based on the use of ZF protein coupled to an effector domain, inducing a loop between the LCR and the γ-globin promoters, which reactivates γ-globin synthesis at the expenses of βS-globin without requiring DNA cleavage.84",
        "Editing the genome holds great promises for gene therapy of hemoglobinopathies and may offer advantages with respect to LV-mediated gene replacement in terms of complexity and cost of manufacturing genetically modified HSCs. However, this technology has still to prove its efficacy and biosafety profile in a real-life context. Off-target effects and unrepaired double-stranded cuts may represent significant risk factors, not necessarily inferior to the potential genotoxic effects of LV integration in the human genome. Given the absence of reliable preclinical models to analyze editing efficiency in long-term repopulating HSCs and any associated genotoxicity, the efficacy and safety of gene editing may eventually be proven only in clinical trials.",

        "Gene therapy, cell therapy, and tissue engineering, known as ”advanced therapies” are the new frontiers for personalized treatments for currently untreatable diseases [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Respective Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) are biopharmaceuticals, whose development is associated with novel challenges for production, quality control (QC), transport, storage and application [7,8,9]. Even when ATMPs are often produced for one patient [7,8,10], they must be produced and controlled under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant practices and pharmaceutical conditions [11], which comprises standardized and validated manufacture and QC performed by qualified personnel using qualified devices, under rigorous hygienic conditions. Each step must be carefully documented to ensure the transparency and traceability. QC should ensure comparable, batch-independent efficiency and safety as defined by respective international regulations [11,12,13,14], which requires testing a small sample of raw, starting materials and of the end product before the release of a batch of the ATMP. However, for personalized, autologous, cell-based ATMPs, often small volume and time-sensitive application limit the time available for QC [7,8,10]. To date, an individual risk-based approach is required for every product [15], which hampers progress in the field. A general approach applicable to personalized ATMPs of small volume and short production time, would promote scientific progress and bring novel therapies into clinical routine more rapidly.",
        "We are developing a non-viral cell-based gene therapy approach to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD), which is the major cause of blindness in the elderly population of industrialized countries [14]. nvAMD is mainly driven by an imbalance of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors favoring an overexpression of the angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and including Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), which requires frequent, often monthly life-long intraocular injection of inhibitors of VEGF [15,16]. To develop a once-for-life treatment for nvAMD, our laboratory, the group of Experimental Ophthalmology directed by Prof. Thumann, University of Geneva, has shown that primary human and animal iris pigment epithelial (IPE) cells are efficiently transfected ex vivo with the Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF) gene using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system, which integrates the gene into the host genome [17,18,19,20]. For treatment of nvAMD in humans by transplantation of PEDF-transfected IPE cells, it is required that (a) the IPE cells are autologous to avoid immune rejection, (b) the cells are not pre-cultured to avoid microorganism contamination, (c) the possibility that extracellular proteins from the culture medium contaminate the autologous cells is prevented, and (d) the loss of cells’ phenotype during culture is avoided (fibroblastic phenotype). Thus, the clinical approach comprises obtaining an iris biopsy from the nvAMD patient, isolating and transfecting IPE cells with the human PEDF and SB genes, consisting of the transposon and the helper transposase, and transplanting the final product (“tIPE”) subretinally into the same patient within 60 min during a single surgical session at a reasonable cost. According to a clinical trial performed by Lappas et al. in which non-transfected IPE cells were transplanted to AMD patients, a low number of cells (10,000–20,000) in the final product is expected [21] This is not compatible with the collection of a sample from the tIPE for QC. Additionally, the transport of tIPE is a challenge, since the biological product needs to be transported from the clean room (or isolator) to the surgery room for transplantation at GMP-compliant conditions (i.e., triple packaging) without hampering its quality [22]. To minimize manipulation steps, tIPE is directly loaded into a sterile microsyringe (Hamilton), ready for injection. The transport of tIPE inside a syringe towards the surgery room is another critical step before administration.",
        "Here, we report the validation procedure according to GMP [11] for the ATMP tIPE, including performance qualification (PQ) of devices, qualification of personnel, and propose a comprehensive process for the release of cell-based personalized therapeutic medicinal products, as well as the development of a bioconfined container to ensure the safe transport of the ATMP from the production to the surgery site [23,24]. To confirm feasibility of the treatment procedure including biopsy harvest, cell isolation, ATMP production and transplantation within 60 min, a proof-of-principle study in rabbits has been performed; the rabbit has been chosen as model due to comparable size of the eye.",
        "During the TargetAMD project (www.targetamd.eu, accessed on 11 January 2012), research and GMP grade (produced by AmBTU, Amsterdam, Netherlands [25,26,27]) plasmid mixtures, which contained 226 ng pFAR4-CMV-SB100x transposase and 3624 ng pFAR4-ITRs-CMV-PEDF-BGH transposon plasmids were suspended in 25 µL of 3P.14 electroporation buffer developed by 3P Biopharmaceuticals (Navarra, Spain) [26]. The customized CliniporatorTM and electroporation cuvettes, developed for the electroporation of small volume cell samples by partner IGEA S.p.A. (Carpi, Modena, Italy), were used to transfect the IPE cells with the plasmid mixture [26,28].",
        "For the in vivo validation of iridectomy, cell isolation, transfection and transplantation, four normal Chinchilla Bastard rabbits bred in our animal facility (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland) had access to food and water ad libitum and were housed in groups whenever possible, under controlled humidity and temperature on a 12 h light/dark cycle. Iridectomy was performed under general anesthesia using Ketalar (Pfizer, Zurich, Switzerland) (35 mg/kg) and Domitor (Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland) (0.5 mg/kg) or Rompun (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) (3 mg/kg) diluted in NaCl injected intra-muscularly; anesthesia was maintained by injecting a half dose every 30 min if necessary. After sedation, the pupils were dilated using Tropicamide eye drops (0.5%, Alloga SA, Burgdorf, Switzerland), eyes were anesthetized by a drop of Tetracaine (1% 0.4 mL; AMEDIS-UE AG, Unterentfelden, Switzerland), and drying of the cornea was avoided by regularly administering humidifying Methocel gel (2%, Amedis-UE AG, Unterentfelden, Switzerland).",
        "To obtain iris biopsies, a 2–4 mm cut was made close to the limbus using an ophthalmic knife (Mani, Tochigi, Japan) in the right eye under a surgical microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The iris was grasped with Colibri forceps and a 1–2 mm section was cut with micro-scissors; the iris spontaneously repositioned in the anterior chamber of the eye and the cut healed without suturing (Figure 1). After a follow-up of 7 days (d) or 90 d, the animals were sacrificed by an overdose of Thiopental (Ospedalia AG, Hünenberg, Switzerland) (500 mg/8 mL NaCl) injected intravenously under general anesthesia.",
        "To isolate IPE cells, biopsies were transported to a laminar flow hood and placed in a 10 cm petri dish containing 500 µL of 0.05% trypsin/0.5 mM EDTA; after 75 min incubation at 37 °C, the trypsin solution was removed and 500 µL DMEM/Hams 12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were added to stop trypsinization. IPE cells were gently scraped from the stroma using a round ophthalmic knife (Mani, Tochigi, Japan) and centrifuged at 120 g for 10 min at room temperature (RT); after aspiration of the supernatant, the pellet was suspended in 15 µL of 3P.14 buffer and transferred to a 1.5 mL tube to which were added 5 µL of the plasmid mixture [25]. Cells were transfected by electroporation using the CliniporatorTM (1 pulse, 200 V, 5 ms) as described [26]. After transfection, the 20 µL of transfected IPE cells were transferred to a 1.5 mL tube and the electroporation cuvette washed two times with 40 µL BSS Plus (Balanced Salt Solution Plus, Alcon, Zug, Switzerland), which was added to the 20 µL of cells. After taking 10 µL of the suspension for cell counting, it was centrifuged at RT for 10 min at 120 g to remove remnant extracellular DNA (including DNA released by damaged cells and plasmid DNA that did not enter cells). The cell pellet was resuspended in a concentration of 20,000 cells/30 µL of BSS Plus and drawn into a 100 µL gastight Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland) connected to a 35 cm long Silkflex tubing with an attached 35G blunt needle for subretinal injection (“RPE-kit”, WPI, Friedberg, Germany).",
        "One or three trokars (TOTALPlus 23Ga VITRECTOMY Pak, Alcon, Zug Switzerland) were inserted into the sclera of the right eye proximal to the limbus on either side of the globe, one to serve as the light source and the second and third to serve as the injection port. The blunt 35G needle attached to the Silkflex tubing was carefully pushed into the injection port trokar, positioned just below the bundle of nerve fibers close to the papilla and 20,000 cells in the Hamilton syringe suspended in 30 µL BSS Plus were injected subretinally. Then, the trokars were removed; the lacerations made by the trokars healed without suturing. Unlike in humans, vitrectomy in rabbits is not required to transplant cells subretinally. Rabbits were followed for 7 d or 90 d. The left eye served as untreated control.",
        "The IOP was measured in the awake animal before, 7 d or 90 d post-surgery using the Tonovet (Icare, Vantaa, Finland) tonometer to exclude harmful alterations. A single-use probe was pressed slightly onto the cornea five times and the re-bound measured; the mean of the five measurements was recorded as the IOP. A video of the fundus and the injection site of both eyes was examined before, 7 d or 90 d post-surgery using a surgical microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and a 1.0X Volk®1 Single-Use Flat Lense (Volk, Cleveland, OH, USA). A drop of Methocel on the surface was used to prevent drying and improving image quality.",
        "Rabbits were inspected post-mortem to determine whether transplantation of PEDF-transfected cells had any macroscopical site effect. The organs inspected in situ visually were: the tear glands, salivary glands, harderian gland, pituitary gland, tongue, esophagus, thyroid and parathyroid glands, thymus, ribs, aorta, gallbladder, stomach, gut, bladder, prostate, seminal vesicle, pancreas, adrenal glands, muscles, peripheral nerves, bone marrow, spinal cord, and lymph nodes. The organs dissected after visual examination were: the cerebrum, cerebellum, optic chiasma, optic nerve, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and testes/ovaries. The skull was opened with a bone tongs. The trunk was opened with an incision from throat to abdomen to inspect and dissect listed organs. The muscles of one thigh were exposed and a peripheral nerve was dissected free and both were visually examined. Bone marrow was collected after the thigh bone was ruptured. The spinal cord was dissected and visible lymph nodes were inspected. If an organ appeared visually abnormal, a biopsy was sent for analysis to a veterinarian pathologist from IDEXX B.V. (Hoofddorp, The Netherlands).",
        "The tIPE (ATMP) manufacture was done by one operator (working under a laminar flow hood) and one assistant (working outside of the laminar flow hood) in the laboratories of the clean room facility of the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG), Switzerland (Laboratoires de Transplantation & Thérapie Cellulaire, LTTC). During training and validation, human iris biopsies from 42 eyes (2–8 d post-mortem) from 28 donors purchased from the Lions Gift of Sight Eye Bank (Saint Paul, MN, USA) were used as starting material.",
        "To obtain iris biopsies, after donor eyes were disinfected in betadine (Mundipharma, Frankfurt, Germany) for 90 s, a simulated iridectomy under a laminar flow hood in a cell laboratory with a similar distance to the LTTC as has the surgery site in the planned clinical trial, was done. A small incision was made close to the limbus with a lancet-formed ophthalmic knife (Mani, Tochigi, Japan), the iris was pulled slightly and a small piece of the iris was cut using micro-scissors and placed into a 1.5 mL tube containing 20 µL 3P.14 electroporation buffer. Six biopsies were taken from each eye with 4 iris samples used to produce tIPE (i01-4) and two iris control samples (Co-1 and Co-2), to isolate cells for counting and determine cell viability. Iris biopsies for tIPE production were brought to the LTTC, where the operator placed the biopsy in a 6 cm petri dish and added 17 µL of 3P.14 buffer. Using a lancet-shaped ophthalmic knife (Mani, Tochigi, Japan) to hold the biopsy, the IPE cells were carefully scraped from the stroma using a round ophthalmic knife (Mani, Tochigi, Japan). Fifteen microliters of the cell suspension were transferred into a 1.5 mL tube to which were added 5 µL of plasmid mixture and cell clumps disrupted by up and down pipetting 2–3 times. The 20 µL mixture was transferred into the CliniporatorTM microcuvette and electroporated (1 pulse, 200 V, 5 ms). The 20 µL of PEDF-transfected cell suspension were transferred to a 1.5 mL tube, the cuvette washed twice with 40 µL BSS Plus and the washes added to the cell suspension. Ten microliters of the cell suspension were used undiluted for cell counting in a C-Chip Neubauer Chamber (NanoEnTek, Seoul, Korea) under a microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) by the assistant; the remaining 90 µL were centrifuged at 120 g for 10 min at RT. The supernatant from the centrifugation was removed and used for QC; the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 µL BSS Plus, i.e., tIPE. After removing a sample of 1000 cells, as determined from the cell count before centrifugation, to assess viability (see Section 2.2.5), remaining tIPE was transferred into a gastight 100 µL Hamilton syringe without producing air bubbles; the final volume loaded into the syringe was noted.",
        "The ATMP bioconfined container was constructed by BioAir S.P.A. (Pero, Italy) following the general scheme for the development of bioconfined systems for the transfer and handling of ATMPs, which comprises the steps “definition”, “design”, “prototype” and “validation” [29,30]. The project details were defined with the input of the tIPE operator (Step 1), considering (a) the size of the syringe, (b) needle connection to the syringe immediately before tIPE transplantation, (c) volume of the final product, (d) possible need of a filter for gas exchange, (e) maintaining sterility during transport, (f) need to have an autoclavable case and a sterile disposable interior, (g) need to prevent movement of syringe plunger during transport to avoid tIPE dispersion, (h) number of syringes transported per month, and (i) cost of ATMP. The prototype design (Step 2) considered material, methodology and engineering [31]. For the outer parts, an autoclavable material was chosen, whereas for the inner part, a sterile and disposable material was selected. The prototype was produced using 3D injection printing and molding (Step 3). In Step 4, the producer tested the suitability and usability of the prototype including loading the container, fitting the syringe in the internal chamber, sealing, transporting, and general handling.",
        "Cell viability was determined using the CytTox Glo® assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after thawing and preparation of substrate and assay buffer, 1000 cells from the 4 tIPE and 2 controls from each eye were dispensed into 6 wells of a 96-well plate to which was added BSS Plus to 200 µL. After adding 50 µL of assay buffer, samples were incubated at RT for 15 min and luminescence (L1) determined. Then, 50 µL of the lysis reagent were added to the wells and after 15 min incubation at RT, luminescence (L2) was determined. Percentage of viable cells is the difference between L2 and L1. To construct a standard curve, a confluent well of a 6-well plate of ARPE-19 cells (156 to 5000 cells in a 1:2 dilution series) was trypsinized for 7 min at 37 °C by adding to the well 200 µL of 0.05% Trypsin/0.5 mM EDTA. Trypsinization was stopped by adding 400 µL DMEM/Ham’s 12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS; the cell suspension was centrifuged at 700 rpm for 7 min at RT. The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet resuspended in 400 µL DMEM/Ham’s 12 and the assay performed as described above.",
        "To verify the purity of tIPE, the DNA content in the centrifugation supernatant (in the following “remnant extracellular DNA”) was determined using the Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions (detection limit: 0–1000 ng dsDNA). Three microliters of the supernatant were mixed with 597 µL of the working solution provided by the manufacturer; 200 µL of the assay solution were pipetted in a 96-well plate and fluorescence read (excitation: 485 nm; emission: 520 nm) using the Omega spectrophotometer (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). Remaining plasmid mixture solution from tIPE manufacture (one vial contained 25 µL but used were only 5 µL) was used to prepare a standard curve from 0.6 to 9.63 ng/µL in a 1:2 dilution series.",
        "The assay has been established in cultured hRPE and ARPE-19 cells (Figure 2). From Gillooly et al. data on DNA content of multiple cells [32], the DNA content of 10,000 cells has been estimated to 52 ng. In the transfection of cells with the PEDF gene, we delivered 770 ng of plasmid DNA. Only 0.7 ng of the added DNA is necessary to transfect 10,000 cells with 1 PEDF gene-copy; thus, the majority of the 770 ng added DNA should be retrieved in the supernatant after centrifugation of transfected cells. To verify the efficacy of centrifugation in extracellular remnant DNA removal, 10,000 ARPE-19 and primary human RPE cells were transfected with the PEDF-plasmid construct. Non-electroporated cells (Co-P) and electroporated cells (Co+P), both without PEDF-plasmid construct added, served as controls. Figure 2 shows that no nucleic acid was measured in the supernatant of Co-P cells whereas low but detectable amount of DNA was present in the Co+P supernatant, suggesting that electroporation has damaged some cells, releasing DNA and explaining DNA in the supernatant of tIPE exceeding 100%. In all transfected cells, the majority of the added DNA was retrieved in the supernatant of the first centrifugation (ARPE-19 cells: 120.82%; hRPE cells: 94.6 ± 19.6%). After the second and third centrifugations, DNA in the supernatants was not detected or only small amounts of less than 10 ng DNA were found. In one ARPE-19 cell sample, DNA in the supernatant was remarkably high after the first centrifugation with a value out of the linear range of the standard curve. The value has been excluded from the analysis (“invalid measurement”). Comparable values measured in the validation batches were similarly excluded.",
        "tIPE was transferred into a sterile 100 µL microsyringe using a 23 G needle (Beckton & Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) comprising the transfected cells suspended in 50 µL BSS Plus, a common intraocular irrigating solution. The actual volume in the syringe was documented, since the sample removed for cell viability measurement, cell clumps, needle’s dead volume and variations in operator’s performance could impact the volume dispensed into the syringe. The cell suspension in the syringe was inspected for the absence of air bubbles and contaminating particulate matter; presence of air bubbles and particulate matter would require refilling of the syringe.",
        "Transport time was recorded as close as possible from the time of biopsy harvest to the start of cell isolation (“T1”) and the time (“T2”) from tIPE production completion to arrival into the cell laboratory for validation purpose (see Section 2.3). T1 was recorded a few minutes longer than the exact value, since the operator stopped the timer after he transferred the biopsy to the production laboratory and returned to the locker room of the LTTC (the platform comprises two locker rooms, four laboratories, one QC room, and two storage rooms); T2 was recorded a few minutes shorter than the exact value, since the operator started the timer after receiving the tIPE and left the locker room. To prevent cell deterioration, the temperature of tIPE during transport should be lower than 37 °C to slow down metabolism but above freezing to avoid cell damage; we defined the allowed temperature range from 4° to 25 °C controlled by cooling the transport box with cooling packs. Temperature was documented by a calibrated thermometer for transport of the biopsy to the LTTC and the transport of tIPE to the cell laboratory.",
        "Gram negatvie bacterial endotoxin levels were determined in the supernatant after plasmid-transfected cells were centrifuged using the Endosafe Nextgen PTS assay (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA) with cartridges of 1.0–0.01 EU/mL sensitivity according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Five microliters of supernatant were diluted 1:100 with LAL (Limulus amebocyte lysate) Reagent and 25 µL of the suspension were pipetted into each of the four wells of the cartridge by the assistant. A value of <0.2 EU/mL was conforming to tIPE release criteria. In case of an invalid value (not non-conforming, but unusable due to assay performance errors), the measurement was repeated; however, after two invalid measurements or a non-conforming value with an endotoxin level greater than 0.2 EU/mL, the QC result was documented as non-conforming. The Endosafe Nextgen PTS documents the endotoxin value as well as temperature, sample reaction time, spike reaction time and spike recovery, which allows the detection of invalid measurements due to technical difficulties.",
        "Additional to quarterly performed environmental controls, for every production the environment, the starting material, and the product were tested for contamination by aerobic, anaerobic bacteria, fungi, and non-viable particulate matter. The starting material and tIPE were tested by culturing in BHI (Brain Heart Infusion) medium on agar plates until a positive result (bacterial growth in the sample tested) or for two weeks. After cell isolation, the iris biopsy stroma (considering the biopsy as starting material) was tested for potential contaminations and 75 µL of the centrifugation supernatant were used to confirm sterility of tIPE. Figure 3 illustrates the locations in the laboratory where samples were collected and analyzed for contamination by culturing in BHI medium until a positive result was evident or for two weeks. One air sample was taken in the sluice room, one on each of the laboratory benches and one in the laminar hood using an air sampler (Biomérieux, Petit Lancy, Switzerland) collecting 1000 L/~10 min. Live microorganisms were determined by settle plates (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) one on either side of the workspace under the laminar hood and one on either laboratory bench. Particle contamination in the air was determined using a particle counter (Bakrona, Basel, Switzerland) in the air of the laboratory and in the sluice room by collecting 500 L/~10 min (production rooms) or 150 L/~10 min (sluice room). Contact plates for environmental monitoring (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) were used to monitor contamination in several areas as indicated in Figure 3. Both, the assistant and the operator tested their right and left gloves by a 5-finger-touch on one contact plate for each glove (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA).",
        "Descriptive statistical analysis was performed for all data (mean, SD, SEM, min, max, range). A D’Agostino & Pearson normality test identified parametric and non-parametric data. Depending on the nature of the data, significant differences between groups were calculated using the unpaired parametric t-test (2 samples), ANOVA (≥3 samples), unpaired non-parametric Mann-Whitney (2 samples) or Kruskal-Wallis (≥3 samples) test. If not noted otherwise, data are shown as mean ± SD. All analyses were made using GraphPad Prism® software version 9.3.1 (471) (GraphPad Software, LLC, San Diego, CA, USA).",
        "The study focused on the feasibility of manufacturing and transplantation of an autologous non-viral ATMP for personalized treatment of nvAMD performed in normal rabbits.",
        "Rabbits were used to verify feasibility of the treatment process. The small cut made in the cornea close to the limbus, was sufficient to obtain an iris biopsy of approximately 1 mm × 2 mm (Figure 1). The procedure was successful with operator-caused lens damage in two eyes; touching of the lens is not an anticipated risk in humans because the larger human eye with a proportionally smaller lens and by the procedure done by experienced surgeons. No adverse reactions were observed during the follow-up period (7 d and 90 d) (Table 1).",
        "Theoretically, the surgery could affect the retina and the IOP and thus, were monitored by fundoscopy and tonometry. Fundus did not show pathological alterations or differences between the treated (right) and the contralateral (left) eye (Table 2). A small, not statistically significant decrease in IOP was observed during the first post-surgical week; 6.0 ± 1.4 mmHg in the treated eye vs. 9.8 ± 1.7 mmHg in the contralateral eye post-surgical at day 7. At day 90, IOP in the treated eyes was 8.0 ± 1.4 mmHg and 9.0 ± 1.4 mmHg in the contralateral eye. Base values were 11.5 ± 2.4 mmHg for the to-be-treated eye and 11.3 ± 2.2 mmHg in the contralateral eye.",
        "To determine potential systemic side effects, organs’ morphology was evaluated. Organs were inspected visually and no abnormalities, defined as the absence of lesions, tumors, hemorrhages and signs of inflammation, i.e., edema or redness, were observed.",
        "To ensure sterility and viability of tIPE during transport from the manufacturing facility to the surgery site, a reusable transport box was manufactured comprising an outer opaque bottom shell and an outer transparent upper shell of temperature resistant, autoclavable plastic, and an inner syringe container fabricated of a non-porous soft plastic to secure the syringe in place preventing movement and fluid dispersal. A silicon gasket between the two outer shells results in an airtight seal when the two shells are fastened together with a clip at each end. The outer and inner container can be sterilized using gamma irradiation. For GMP-compliant use, it will be supplied with triple layer packaging to be opened in the controlled environment of the clean room. Throughout the whole transportation, the syringe will be firmly kept in a secure position and the piston cannot move accidentally, thus avoiding to expel the contents as long as the container (and the syringe inside) are kept in a horizontal position.",
        "The validation run (ValRun) was designed to satisfy multiple requirements; the 143 tIPE productions performed were used to:Validate the process;Validate the cleaning procedure;Optimize the process under GMP-compliant conditions;Define release criteria;Collect sufficient in vitro data from human donor eyes to demonstrate quality of tIPE;Qualify the CliniporatorTM (performance qualification, PQ);Train (carrier, assistant, operator) and qualify personnel (operator).",

The team consisted of four experienced researchers, of which three were trained as tIPE operators, one team member was responsible for production (RP), a second was responsible for the equipment (RE), and a third was responsible for QC (RQ).",
        "Parameters were recorded as conforming or non-conforming (“out of specification”, OOS, e.g., low cell number), which is different from being valid or invalid due to technical reasons (e.g., failed “Spike Recovery” in the endotoxin measurement). A complete production was defined as being compliant or non-compliant.",
        "Validation benchmarks were defined as follows:",
        "Conformity of release criteria: (a) ≥80 valid productions; (b) mean values must be conforming; (c) ≥75% of productions must be conforming; (d) at least the last 6 consecutive productions must be conforming.",
        "Compliance of a production: (a) ≥80 valid productions; (b) mean values of individual parameters must be conforming; (c) ≥50% of the batches must be compliant in all parameters; (d) at least the last 6 consecutive productions must be compliant.",

        "The complete process is presented in Figure 4. The carrier prepared i01-2 and Co-1 in the laboratory and packaged the iris biopsies for transport. i01-2 were brought to the LTTC. Upon return to the laboratory, the carrier isolated the cells from Co-1, centrifuged the sample, aspirated the supernatant and resuspended the cells in 20 µL 3P.14 buffer (GMP-grade); 1000 cells were analyzed for cell viability. During the centrifugation step, a 10 µL aliquot of the isolated cells were counted in a Neubauer chamber. In the LTTC, the production team isolated and transfected the cells from biopsy i01 and 2 (as detailed in Section 2.3.1). Then, 5 µL of the centrifugation supernatant were used to determine the level of endotoxins. After termination of the production, tIPE was filled in the syringe ensuring the absence of air bubbles. The whole process should not take longer than 30 min. The carrier recorded duration and temperature of the transport and controlled the closure of the transport box by the integrity of a designated tape. The RQ controlled correct and readable labelling of tIPE and the completeness of the documentation. The production team kept 3 µL of the centrifugation supernatant to quantify remnant extracellular DNA; 1000 cells were analyzed for cell viability. The iris stroma and the remaining 70 µL from the supernatant of the centrifugation of the transfected cells were prepared for microbiological analysis. The process was repeated for i03-4 and Co-2 (biopsies were taken from the same donor eyes as for i01, i02 and Co-1). Viability of all products (i01-4) and controls (Co1-2) and the DNA concentration in the centrifugation supernatant were analyzed under laboratory conditions; stroma and supernatant, immersed in BHI medium, were analyzed for microbiological contamination as were all environmental controls by the Dept. of bacteriology, HUG.",
        "After an interim analysis, the first 39 productions were defined as “training phase” used to optimize the process, define release criteria and train personnel. This was followed by the subsequent 104 validation productions. Since microbiological analysis requires a minimum of 5 days, it is not possible to obtain microbiological results for the proposed treatment that requires cell transplantation within approximately 60 min from biopsy to transplantation. However, the microbiological analysis has been and will be necessary for therapeutic decisions in the unlikely case that an infection would occur post-transplantation. Table 4 details the specifications and QC performed during production and required for batch release. Apart from the QC reported above, all starting material was analyzed for completeness and validity. To deliver maximal data in the validation, it has been decided to continue the production under circumstances that may lead to a stop of the production in the clinical trial.",
        "Figure 5 illustrates the effect of personnel training on “cell number”, “cell viability”, “remnant extracellular DNA” and “time of the manufacture of tIPE”; the mean values of productions 1–39 (training phase) and productions 40–143 (validation) were compared. The operators isolated a significant (p < 0.0001) higher number of cells per biopsy over time (10,487 ± 9798 cells vs. 17,882 ± 11,725 cells). Cell viability increased slightly but not significant (p = 0.1239) over time (25.56% ± 25.56% vs. 31.92 ± 19.04%). The remnant extracellular DNA concentration increased significantly (p < 0.0001) over time (35.53 ± 28.93% vs. 80.32 ± 21.31%). Similarly, the time of production was significantly (p < 0.0001) shortened by training (25.33 ± 5.72 min vs. 19.59 ± 2.39 min). The other release criteria were conforming from the first production on.",
        "Productions for validation and qualification were performed using donor eyes as specified in Table 3 Donors’ “age”, “time of death to cell isolation” and “gender” were not statistically different between the training and validation phases (age: p = 0.1706; time of death to cell isolation: p = 0.4733; sex: p = 0.7047).",
        "Cell number. A sufficient number of cells in tIPE is crucial for successful transplant engraftment and levels of therapeutic protein expression. Previous in vivo experiments in rats have demonstrated that 5000 transplanted cells secrete a sufficient amount of PEDF to inhibit neovascularization [33]. During the ValRun, 17,882 ± 11,725 cells were isolated from biopsies (Figure 6). To investigate the effect of time between the first and last biopsy, we isolated cells from two control biopsies taken immediately after opening the eye (Co-1: 14,460 ± 9501 cells) and taken after the fourth iridectomy (Co-2: 11,605 ± 7412 cells) with an average 2.5 h between first and fourth biopsy. There was a decrease in number of cells isolated (Co-1 and Co-2); however, it was not statistically different (p > 0.999). On the other hand, the number of cells isolated from the four iridectomies showed a small but statistically not significant (p > 0.999) increase from i01 to i04 (i01: 15,183 ± 9261 cells; i02: 16,846 ± 9215 cells; i03: 19,111 ± 10,752 cells; i04: 20,913 ± 16,263 cells). Cells were counted before centrifugation despite the fact that centrifugation reduces cell number. To quantify the effect of centrifugation on cell number and verify that tIPEs contained a minimum of 5000 cells, cells were counted before and after centrifugation in 12 tIPE productions. Note the significant loss of cells, i.e., 21,271 ± 10,201 cells before centrifugation and 8833 ± 5628 cells after centrifugation. Even though the mean of the samples differed significantly (p = 0.0005, ***), the cell number was above the defined 5000 cells in 11 of the 12 tested productions. Of the 104 total productions, cell count was conforming in 100 (96.2%) cases, including the last 24 consecutive productions.",
        "Cell viability. The mean “time from donor death to cell isolation” for the eyes available for the ValRun was 7.35 ± 1.29 d (range 2–8 d). We assume that this factor decreased cell viability compared to biopsies harvested from patients and thus, we did not define an absolute percentage of viable cells as specification in the ValRun but the difference in viable cells in tIPE to control cells (Co-1 and Co-2) should not be significant. Since the controls were not mixed with plasmid DNA, electroporated, or transported, a comparable percentage of viable cells in tIPE and controls excludes a negative impact of the production procedure on cell viability. Figure 7 illustrates that the manipulations necessary for the manufacturing and transport of tIPE did not impact cell viability.",
        "Remnant extracellular DNA. After transfection, remnant extracellular DNA was removed from tIPE by centrifugation with DNA remaining in the supernatant. The remnant extracellular DNA in the supernatant measured for 86 productions showed that the majority of extracellular DNA (80.32 ± 21.31%) was removed. Of these 86 productions, 14 were non-compliant, of which 13 were non-compliant due to a too high fluorescence to reliably calculate the free extracellular DNA concentration (invalid) and only one measurement was non-conforming (Figure 8).",
        "tIPE volume. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 µL BSS Plus and tIPE filled into the Hamilton syringe. However, the final volume in the syringe was less than 50 µL since an aliquot of 1000 cells was removed to analyze cell viability. Consequently, the final volume of tIPE was different for every batch. The specification and release criterion of 15 µL was defined by following consideration: Given the mean number of cells isolated from one biopsy (17,882 ± 11,725 cells), the necessary cell number of ≥5000 cells will be available in ≥15 µL tIPE. The volume was conforming in all productions, with a mean of 35.34 ± 6.0 µL (81.18 ± 12.37%) (Figure 9). The absence of air bubbles in the syringe was verified in all 104 productions.",
        "Production time. Since the production time might affect cell viability, it was recorded. To standardize tIPE manufacture, an a priori time limit of 30 min per tIPE manufacture was set, which would allow for cell transplantation into the subretinal space of a patient to be accomplished within one hour. Documentation of the time for the recorded 103 tIPE productions was 19.59 ± 2.39 min (Figure 10). Additionally, we did not find a reduction in cell viability during the time that elapsed between the first and fourth tIPE manufacture from a single eye (Figure 7).",
        "Endotoxin level. Theoretically, cell products can be contaminated by endotoxins, why we determined their level in the ValRun. Of 97 tIPE productions for which the endotoxin levels were analyzed, 90 (92.8%) had endotoxin levels below the minimum allowed with the last 13 consecutive productions being conforming. The 7 non-compliant tIPE productions were non-compliant due to invalid endotoxin measurements.",
        "Aseptic production and sterility of iris biopsies and tIPE. Performance of manufacture at aseptic conditions is key to produce an ATMP in pharmacological quality. We tested environmental, biopsy and tIPE sterility for all productions.",
        "Environmental sterility. Even though four biopsies were taken and four tIPE manufactured from each donor’s eye, during the ValRun only one environmental control per eye was analyzed for environmental microbiological contamination. In the case of a positive result, all four tIPEs from the respective eye were considered non-compliant. Results showed that 20 of 26 analyses (76.9%) were sterile with the last 8 consecutive analyses conforming. Particle analysis performed by the Labguard® system (Biomérieux, Petit Lancy, Switzerland) verified a GMP-conforming environment for 100 out of 104 productions (96.2%).",
        "Biopsy sterility. Analysis of the stroma from the iris biopsies showed that 96.2% (100) were sterile including the last 8 consecutive analyses.",
        "tIPE sterility. Analysis of the supernatant from the centrifugation after electroporation showed that 96.2% (100) of tIPE manufactured, including the last 8 consecutives, were sterile.",
        "Transport time & temperature. The temperature was recorded when the biopsy or tIPE was placed into the transport box (T1′S′ for biopsies and T2′S′ for tIPEs) and when it was taken out of the transport box (T1′E′ for biopsies and T2′E′ for tIPEs). Even though the cooling packs thaw during the transport, the temperature for all 38 documented productions remained within the acceptable range of 4–25 °C with a mean temperature of 11.33 ± 3.59 °C. The duration of the 52 documented transports was within the limit of 30 min (T1: 12.22 ± 3.45 min; T2 2.80 ± 1.25 min) (Figure 11); the difference between T1 and T2 is detailed in the discussion.",
        "Overall compliance. After analysis of the individual parameters, overall compliance was evaluated. We were able to demonstrate conformity for all release criteria, i.e., cell number, remnant extracellular DNA, production time, tIPE volume, endotoxin level, aseptic processing and sterility. We were also able to show that cell viability was not significantly reduced during production and successfully validated the transport protocol. Product batches with missing values were counted as invalid but were not included in the calculation of compliant productions. Eighty-eight of 104 tIPE manufactured were valid productions (84.6%) and 52 of these were compliant (59.1%) with eight consecutive compliant productions at the end of the series.",
        "Qualification CliniporatorTM. The performance of the CliniporatorTM was automatically recorded for every production and archived. The ValRun successfully qualified the performance of the new device with 100% reliability.",
        "Qualification personnel. Of the three operators assigned to manufacture tIPE two (P1 and P3) became qualified for tIPE production during the ValRun; operator P2, who could not complete the number of necessary valid productions during the ValRun, has since been qualified. Product quality did not vary significantly between the three operators demonstrating robustness of the standardized process (Table 5).",
        "Here, the validation of the manufacture process and QC for batch release of the new ATMP tIPE has been described. The specific challenges included the following: setting the GMP requirements, standardization, assessment of its biological nature, short production times, potential alterations of the ATMP ex vivo (e.g., cell death), small sized autologous products whose amount is limited to clinical dose, irreversible cell labelling preventing cell characterization or purification, and the maintenance of a closed, GMP-compliant circuit from starting material collection to production, transport, and transplantation [9,34].",
        "Existing QC methods for in-process cell analysis include magnetic and/or fluorescent cell sorting integrated into production platforms such as the CliniMACS® system (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). However, this particular QC method requires sample processing with the loss of the analyzed cells and without providing a characterization of the complete batch. Other services and instruments for classical analytical methods of cell culture medium or lysed cells, e.g., ELISA, HPLC and PCR require from a few hours up to several days (e.g., Solvias, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) without providing complete characterization. Recent approaches have been developed that provide more comprehensive testing such as multiplex ELISA (e.g., ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) [35,36]. Reversible labeling (REAlease® MicroBead Technology, Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), and microfluidics have been developed for damage-free cell sorting with a fluorescent label (PHC) or label-free using impedance cytometry (Zurich Instruments, Zurich, Switzerland). Collectively, these techniques require long time and often large samples and thus, are not suitable for ATMPs that have a limited number of cells and/or requiring transplantation within a short period of time, such as for tIPE. It is not recommended to culture the cells for later transplantation, as it has the potential to alter the cell’s phenotype as well as introduce harmful contaminants [37]. Other types of ATMPs like in vivo administered vector-gene constructs, such as LUXTURNA®, which is an adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 2- human RPE65 construct to deliver the RPE65 gene to RPE cells allow comprehensive process validation and QC [38] using classical procedures since the construct does not degrade with time and can be produced in excess [39].",
        "Since currently available methods are not appropriate for QC analyses for batch release of tIPE, according to the risk-based approach (RBA) suggested by Eudralex [11], we analyzed key intermediates in-process and relied on a comprehensive process validation, during which the whole product was used for analysis. Following the quality by design (QBD) approach [40] we defined the critical quality attributes (CQA) of tIPE, specifically, suspension in functional BSS Plus, cell number, product volume, method of administration, absence of biocontaminants, absence of endotoxins (<0.2 EU/mL), minimal remnant extracellular DNA, and stable cell viability throughout the time of tIPE manufacture. The identified critical process parameters (CPP) are homogenous suspension in BSS Plus, integral triple packaging, time of production, temperature and reliability of transport.",
        "Since the treatment protocol for tIPE is designed to transplant the ATMP within approximately one hour after taking a biopsy from the patient, tIPE results of analyses for sterility will not be available before release. Thus, the cleaning procedure validation (equipment and environment) has been integrated within the comprehensive, extended ValRun, which included 104 productions, though commonly, one PQ for device qualification is sufficient and the qualification of personnel, validation of cleaning and manufacture processes is sufficient to be performed in three consecutive batches [11].",
        "The validation process was started with the definition and analysis of limits for the identified CQAs and CPPs to determine training effects and to eliminate the latter from the final validation. Only productions performed after reaching a level of quality stably compliant, were integrated into the ValRun. In addition, the 104 productions from 26 donors addressed adequately the inherent variability of the starting material. The high number of productions and the inherent variability of the starting material also required the definition of benchmarks for successful validation and differentiation between the conformity of a release criterion, compliance of the production process as a whole and personnel qualification as described in Section 3.3.1. We were able to show conformity of all CQAs and CPPs including stable cell viability in >75% of productions. The cleaning validation was shown by environmental controls, which were negative in 76.9% and sterility analyses of starting material and final product were negative for 96.2% of biopsies and supernatant samples, which conform with the established parameters. In reanalyzing the process during the ValRun, the initial packaging of the biopsies was identified as a potential step responsible for contamination. Implementing additional disinfection measures improved the process and following 32 consecutive environmental controls were compliant. It has to be noted that the number of both, positive and negative environmental controls, is biased since the analysis was performed on each eye and not on each of the four biopsies from a single eye. To ensure sterility during delivery of tIPE from the manufacturing to the surgical site, a customized bioconfined container for transportation of tIPE was designed to be a simple, economical and commercially competitive product, manufactured using 3D injection printing [41]. The material was chosen to make it autoclavable and therefore reusable [42] with a disposable internal syringe holder. An enhanced version with a spring in which the syringe will be clamped to “close” the syringe during transport is in development and will further improve safety. The PQ of the CliniporatorTM functioned without difficulty for all 104 ValRun productions. A successful manufacture process validation requiring ≥50% of compliant productions, including six consecutive compliant productions, was successfully accomplished. Finally, the ValRun qualified the operators successfully.",
        "The ValRun was designed to mimic the proposed clinical trial protocol as closely as possible. The strengths of the study in regard to the proposed clinical trial were: (a) use of the same Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), specifically created for tIPE production, (b) iris biopsies taken from human eyes, (c) similar hygienic conditions for iris biopsy preparation, (d) similar transport settings. The differences from the proposed clinical trial and thus limitations of the ValRun were: (a) iridectomies were performed by a team member and not by the surgeon, (b) iris biopsies were cut through a larger corneal incision, which is different from surgical practice, (c) four biopsies were taken from one eye whereas for the proposed clinical trial one biopsy will be taken from the patient’s eye. The data presented here is derived from IPE cells isolated up to 8 days post-mortem from donor eyes, which may be not as vital as cells isolated from a patient’s biopsy. Our data shows that viability of IPE cells isolated from post-mortem donor eyes is 31.92 ± 19.04% whereas Lappas et al. determined viability of patient-derived IPE cells to be 75.45% [21]. For the proposed clinical trial, the results of sterility analyses will be available only after transplantation of tIPE, which poses a risk; however, this risk is acceptable since the percentage of contaminations was low during the ValRun, the customized biocontainer ensures a closed manufacture and transport circuit; additionally, post-operative fundoscopies allow identification of early signs of infection and initiation of appropriate treatment. Nevertheless, the prediction of the quality of autologous, personalized products by pre-clinical data, validation procedures and in-process controls is limited. A Japanese study demonstrated the advantage of comprehensive QC before transplantation: iPS-derived RPE cells should be transplanted to AMD patients and only the QC performed pre-transplantation allowed the discovery of potentially harmful aberrations in DNA copy number in one transplant [43]. However, for tIPE, transfection related side effects are minimal since the integration profile of SB-based modified cells have a negligible risk of integration into active genes and oncogenes [20] and no known tumorigenic activity [44]. The risk of toxic side effects from cell debris, the vector or the PEDF protein secreted by the cells are minimal since debris and remnant extracellular (vector and chromosomal) DNA are removed during tIPE manufacture and PEDF is ubiquitously expressed in the human body [45]. For safety reasons, the guarantee of successful removal of remnant extracellular DNA was given priority to the cell loss during centrifugation. Since the cells are transplanted into the eye, they are easily accessible and can be destroyed by laser ablation if necessary. The only remaining limit of the present process is the lack of a method to determine the efficacy of individual batches of tIPE before transplantation, since current methodologies to determine efficacy or transgene integration rate are not suitable for ATMP QC [46,47].",
        "As aforementioned, transport settings were similar to those foreseen in the clinical trial. The distance from the laboratory and the surgery room, respectively, to the LTTC are similar, and though tIPE was not transplanted after production in the ValRun, it was similarly packed as it would have been in the regular clinical use. The team member responsible for the transport recorded the time from iridectomy to the LTTC and the time after production back to the laboratory. It has to be noted that before transferring the iris samples to the team in the LTTC, the carrier had to prepare the samples for entry to the platform, dress himself for entry and stopped the time after coming back to the locker room and the successful transfer; therefore, this time “T1” is longer than “T2” that purely recorded the time necessary for the way from the locker room to the laboratory. Nevertheless, the total procedure time (adding T1, T2 and the production time) remains far below the limit of 60 min (30 min for the transport plus 30 min for the production) with a mean procedure time of 34.59 min. Transport temperature was always in defined limits; nevertheless, during the scheduled clinical trial, a box with electronically controlled cooling elements will enhance standardization of temperature conditions.",
        "To verify that the proposed treatment approach, namely taking an iris biopsy from a patient, isolating, transfecting and transplanting the cells subretinally in the same patient within one hour, is feasible, a study was carried out in rabbits that simulated the proposed protocol considering that isolating cells from the rabbit iris requires 75 min trypsinization whereas in humans, IPE cells can be scraped from the stroma without pretreatment. The transport from the animal surgery room to the laboratory, where cell isolation took place, is longer (~7 min) than the path from the clinic’s surgery room to the LTTC (~2 min). Isolated rabbit IPE cells were used to manufacture a cell product similar to tIPE following the protocol for the proposed human clinical trial. Subtracting the time for IPE cell trypsinization, the overall process from biopsy to transplantation was feasible in 60 min as scheduled for the clinical trial. After transplantation, rabbits were monitored for 7 d or 90 d and no adverse effect or organ abnormalities were observed. The weight loss in rabbit no. 4 was considered not related to tIPE since all other measured parameters were normal. We hypothesize that the lowered IOP at day 7 resulted from the breaching of the posterior chamber during the subretinal transplantation of tIPE.",
        "In the ValRun, both individual parameters and the overall compliance were evaluated. The results show variability, which resulted from the unknown quality of the starting material, i.e., donor eye-derived IPE cells. We were able to demonstrate compliance for all release criteria (cell number, remnant extracellular DNA, production duration, tIPE volume, endotoxin level, aseptic processing and sterility of biologic material). We confirmed that cell viability is not significantly reduced during production and successfully validated the transport protocol. The ValRun confirmed an aseptic manufacture though the design of environmental controls was influenced by the ValRun set-up, which had to make compromises, since we performed one control per eye from which 6 biopsies had been collected, while in the real surgical setting every production will be controlled. Product batches with missing values were counted as non-applicable and not included in the calculation of compliant productions. Overall, 52 tIPE manufactured were compliant with all parameters with 8 consecutive compliant productions at the end of the series. A set of analyses was designed to be performed rapidly during tIPE manufacture and to be transferable to analyze tIPE manufactured from a patient’s biopsy during the proposed clinical trial. The absence of complex techniques permits implementation at other tIPE manufacture centers as well as being adaptable to comparable ATMPs.",
        "Advanced therapies offer promise for millions of patients but manufacture of GMP-compliant ATMPs is challenging [9,13,40] often requiring the development of novel methodologies to simplify the workflow in closed and automated systems. For the validation of tIPE, the protocol comprises an in vivo ValRun that is feasible for any novel cell therapy displaying strong constraints in cell number and production time. The ex vivo ValRun using human donor tissue successfully validated the manufacture, qualified devices, and personnel for application to future tIPE manufacture and the implementation of a “simplified” QC protocol for clinical use. The standardized procedure allows the transfer of tIPE manufacturing to other clinical centers and comparable ATMPs for the broad application of this and similar therapies. The first in-human clinical application of tIPE for the treatment of nvAMD is planned for 2023 at one clinical center followed by a multi-centric phase II trial.",

        "Multiple myeloma (MM) has a significant impact on a patient's quality of life (QoL) because the patient becomes dependent on others, even for routine activity execution and personal care.1 MM treatment includes therapy for the underlying disease and supportive therapy to enhance QoL. The aim of MM treatment is to control the disease, particularly its bone destruction. Healthcare professionals involved in MM treatment must minimize any post-treatment complications and ensure the best possible long-term QoL for each patient. International studies assessing the QoL of patients with MM were validated in developed countries. In Brazilian public hospitals, MM patients have important related social, economic, and emotional difficulties, including the following: a low family budget, unemployment, difficulties in receiving government financial support after diagnosis, a long distance between the home and the hospital, transportation difficulties for disable patient, the absence of a caregiver, and poor family support related to social problems. Because of these difficulties, we believe that it is important to evaluate whether high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), could improve the QoL of our patients (other than clinical benefits and disease control).",
        "Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the impact of MM in the QoL of patients treated in two public institutions in São Paulo State, Brazil, using a generic Short Form 36 Health Survey and a questionnaire specific for oncologic patients (QLQ-C30) upon diagnosis, after the clinical treatment, and at day +100 after ASCT. We also evaluated whether ASCT improves the QoL of our economically challenged population.",
        "Study design. Between March 2006 to August 2007, we evaluated 49 MM patients who were treated at Disciplina de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade Federal de São Paulo São Paulo/UNIFESP (a total of 26 patients) and Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São Paulo (a total of 23 patients). We did not include patients with solitary plasmacytoma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or patients without a physical/emotional condition for a 30-minute interview. Patients who were more than 70 years old, had chronic renal insufficiency requiring dialysis, congestive cardiac insufficiency, or cardiac amyloidosis did not undergo high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT. Written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients, and the study was approved by the ethics committees of these two institutions (CEP no. 0249/06 and CEP no. 374/06, respectively).",
        "Economic class assessment. A questionnaire that defined the economic classes of each of the 49 MM patients was applied using Brazil's Economic Classification (www.ibope.com.br). This classification was created in 2000 and considers how many bathrooms, color TVs, radios, cars, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, DVD players, refrigerators, freezers and housemaids are in the patient's household. It also considers the highest education level of any household member (not necessarily the MM patient). The final score classifies the patient within one of seven economic classes (A1/2, B1/2, C, D, or E). Based on the dollar value in 2000, an A1-class patient has a family budget of US $5,000/month, and an E-class patient has a family budget of US $130/month.",
        "Quality-of-life questionnaires. Two quality-of-life instruments were used in this study: the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)2 and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30).3 The SF-36 is an internationally validated instrument that can be self-administered or administered over the phone by trained health professionals. It includes a multi-item scale that assesses the following eight health domains: physical function, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social function, role-emotional, and mental health. The physical and mental components are summaries of the eight domains in the SF-36 questionnaire. These domains have final scores between 0 and 100, where zero corresponds to the worst health state, and 100 corresponds to the best health state.2 This questionnaire has been adapted and validated in Portuguese since 1999.2 The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is an internationally validated instrument in Portuguese (Brazilian) and incorporates nine multi-item scales: five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and global health and quality-of-life scales (dyspnea, insomnia, lack of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulty).3 These scales have final scores between 0 and 100, where high scores indicate better outcomes for the functional scales and global health and worse outcomes for the symptom and quality-of-life scales. Authorizations for the use of the SF-36 and QLQ-C30 questionnaires (Portuguese [Brazilian] version) were given by Dr. Marcos Bosi Ferraz and Dr. Rozana M. Ciconelli and the EORTC Quality of Life Group, respectively, in May 2006. These questionnaires were administered to patients upon diagnosis, after the clinical treatment (post-treatment/pre-ASCT), and at day +100 after ASCT (D+100 ASCT). Of the 49 patients, 29 were evaluated upon diagnosis, 27 were evaluated post-treatment/pre-ASCT (9 patients were also evaluated at diagnosis), and 14 were evaluated at D+100 ASCT (12 patients were also evaluated post-treatment/pre-ASCT). Thus, the 49 MM patients generated 70 total completed interviews, as depicted in the flow diagram of the study design (Figure 1). All of the interviews were conducted by one of the principal researchers (V.C.S.), and the average time required to complete the questionnaires was approximately 30 minutes (while the patient was waiting for the physician consultation).",
        "Statistical analysis. The sample classification (according to sex, isotype, disease stage, and the International Staging System [ISS]) was expressed as absolute numbers and as relative percentages. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the categorical variables among the groups. The ages were expressed as means ± standard deviations. For the SF-36 and QLQ-30 questionnaire score analyses, we followed all of the directions provided by each responsible group.2,4,5 The interviews that were generated by the quality-of-life questionnaires upon diagnosis, post-treatment/pre-ASCT and at D+100 ASCT were compared using ANOVA (for comparisons of the three groups), post hoc tests (for two-by-two comparisons of the three groups) and paired t-tests (the same case at two different times). The level of significance for all of the statistical tests was 5%.",
        "There were no statistically significant differences among the three evaluated groups with respect to sex, age, isotype, clinical stage, and ISS (Table 1). With respect to economic class, the following classification was obtained: 4.0% in B1, 8.2% in B2, 63.3% in C, 22.5% in D, and 2.0% in E. According to our classification, 87.8% of the included patients had a familial budget of less than US $600 per month (i.e., economic classes C, D, or E). The generic SF-36 questionnaire demonstrated that physical function, role-physical, and bodily pain were statistically different across all three groups and favored the D+100 ASCT group (ANOVA; Table 2). The physical component portion of the SF-36 had borderline statistical significance and favored the D+100 ASCT, which corresponds to the physical function, role-physical, and bodily pain domains. The QLQ-C30 questionnaire confirmed the SF-36 results with respect to physical function and bodily pain and improved role functioning, fatigue, the lack of appetite and constipation and usually favored the D+100 ASCT group (ANOVA; Table 3). The significant results obtained using the post hoc tests (two-by-two comparisons of the three groups,) are shown in Table 4. The outcomes were better after treatment (including ASCT). Paired t-tests (comparing the same case at two different times) demonstrated improvements in fatigue (p = 0.036) and global health (p = 0.045) after clinical treatment compared to the time of diagnosis (as determined by the QLQ-C30). This finding confirms the post hoc results. Paired t-tests demonstrated improvements in physical function (p = 0.022) and role-emotional (p = 0.043) when the patients at the end of their clinical treatments were compared to the patients at D+100 ASCT using the SF-36 questionnaire. The QLQ-C30 detected significant improvements in the global health (p = 0.034) and social characteristics (p = 0.044) when the same patients in the two aforementioned situations were compared.",
        "In this study, we characterized the impact of MM on the QoL of patients treated in two public institutions in São Paulo State, Brazil, using a generic (SF-36) questionnaire and a questionnaire specific for oncologic patients (QLQ-C30) upon diagnosis, after clinical treatment and at day +100 after ASCT. The SF-36 is an internationally validated instrument that can be self-administered or given over the phone. This questionnaire has been adapted and validated in Portuguese since 1999.2 We found only one previous report that described the use of the SF-36 questionnaire in MM patients to compare QoL pre- and post-kyphoplasty.6 Recently, the EORTC validated a disease-specific questionnaire module (QLQ-MY20) for patients with MM. The study was performed through the EORTC Quality of Life Group using clinical trials in seven countries. The social support scale was removed in the final analysis because it did not discriminate between the groups in this population.7 The differences observed when comparing the MM patients upon diagnosis and at D+100 ASCT were already present in one recent QoL study from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, that used other indices.8",
        "However, in Brazilian public hospitals, the economic situation of MM patients is completely different from that of developed countries, where all of the questionnaires were designed. The majority of patients in this study are in economic class C, which means that 87.8% of the included patients have a family budget of less than US $600/month (i.e., economic class C, D, or E). Therefore, it is important to apply such questionnaires in underdeveloped countries to ensure that ASCT is a good option for their incurable disease in this population. The QLQ-MY20 was not validated in Portuguese (Brazilian) when the questionnaires were applied and, therefore, was not used in our study. Although the questionnaires are designed to be self-completed, in this study the questionnaires were given during interviews performed by a principal researcher. The questionnaires were conducted in an interview because most of the patients were considered to be functionally illiterate and/or could not complete the forms alone. Others could read but were unable to understand what needed to be answered. We believe that administering the questionnaire by the same person provides more uniform results. One criticism of this study design is that the patient groups were not the same at the three time-points that were investigated. This could limit the power of the observation; however, the paired t-test results from both questionnaires showed improvements in the patients' QoL.",
        "In conclusion, this study supports the use of the EORTC QLQ-C30 as part of routine clinical care in MM patients in developing countries. Our results also suggest that the questionnaire for cancer patients, QLQ-C30, seems to be more informative than the generic questionnaire, SF-36. Additionally, the QLQ-C30 reflects the benefits of ASCT for the QoL of MM patients from two public Brazilian institutions that provide assistance for economically challenged patients.",

        "The intestinal inflammation associated with CD is caused by mucosal immune system reactivity to luminal antigen in genetically susceptible individuals. Active intestinal inflammation is associated with dysbiosis of the fecal and mucosal microbiota and increased intestinal permeability with alterations in innate lymphoid cell (ILC) populations. Defects in the innate immune pathway in CD are implicated by pathogenic mutations in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and autophagy-related protein 16-1 (ATG16L1) genes which suggest impairment of bacterial sensing and clearance. CD is associated with increased IL-12/IL-23 release from antigen-presenting cells and an imbalance in the differentiation of Th1/Th17 effector and regulatory lymphocytes (1, 2).",
        "The incidence of CD is increasing in young adults who live with their disease for six decades (3). In addition, there has been a significant increase in CD incidence in newly industrialized countries of Africa, Asia, and South America (4). The prevalence of CD in the UK stands at approximately 145/100,000 (5) with 9.5 new cases per 100,000 annually (6). The highest prevalence in North America is reported in Canada at 319/100,000 (4). Traditional medical management focuses on controlling intestinal inflammation using conventional or biological therapy. Although many patients respond to first line biologic therapy, a recent prospective UK registry of 1,500 patients with CD commencing their first anti-TNF therapy reports primary non-response in between 16.9 and 23.7% of patients (7) and a secondary loss of response in a further 29% of patients over 2 years (7).",
        "Recent single and multicenter cohort studies have reported a significant burden of adverse events with anti-TNF therapies including an increased risk of lymphoma independent of the use of concomitant thiopurine therapy (8, 9). The anti-integrin vedolizumab and the IL-12/23 antibody ustekinumab are both licensed as second-line biologic therapy for refractory CD. However, both therapies are less effective at inducing and maintaining remission in patients that have been exposed to anti-TNF therapy previously (10). Although novel biological therapies are in clinical development none have reported short- or long-term remission rates in more than 50% patients. Furthermore, biologic therapies currently constitute the largest proportion of the total treatment costs of patients with CD (11).",
        "Patients refractory to medical therapy and those who develop stricturing or penetrating complications of disease progression require surgical resection of the affected intestine (12). However, disease recurrence after surgery is common and many patients face repeated or extensive surgeries that may require a stoma or result in short bowel syndrome and a requirement for parenteral nutrition support. Although the introduction of biologic therapies has been associated with a reduction in the rates of surgery over the recent decade, there has been no reduction in the requirement for repeat surgery (13). Patients with active disease refractory to currently licensed therapies in whom surgery is inappropriate or declined face ineffective biologic therapy and frequent courses of corticosteroids which are associated with a significant burden of treatment-related morbidity and mortality and high health-care resource utilization (11). There is a clear unmet need for an effective long-term therapy for this cohort of patients.",
        "Over the last two decades, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) has been identified as a promising therapeutic option for patients with severe autoimmune diseases (ADs). Mechanistic studies suggest that restoration of immunological tolerance in chronic autoimmunity occurs after auto-HSCT via eradication of immune memory and reconfiguration of the immune system. Although case reports suggested exceptional benefit for patients with refractory CD after auto-HSCT (14, 15), concerns about safety and a lack of understanding as to whether benefit relates to the chemotherapeutic agents administered during mobilization/pre-transplant conditioning regimen or the transplant itself, led to the Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease (ASTIC) randomized controlled trial (NCT00297193) (16, 17). This was conducted at 11 accredited centers in 6 European countries (16, 17).",
        "Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease compared cyclophosphamide mobilization alone to mobilization, high-dose chemotherapy, and auto-HSCT in patients with refractory CD (16, 17). Eligible patients underwent peripheral blood stem cell mobilization with high-dose cyclophosphamide (4 g/m2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), after which they were randomized to immediate auto-HSCT or conventional care for 1 year (16, 17).",
        "The primary endpoint for the trial was defined as clinical disease remission (CDAI < 150) for 3 months, with no medication for CD and no evidence of active disease on imaging and endoscopy at 1 year. Few patients randomized to immediate HSCT or who underwent mobilization and were then randomized to conventional care achieved the ambitious primary endpoint at 1 year. However, ASTIC did demonstrate benefits of auto-HSCT over conventional care in more traditional endpoints for therapeutic trials in this area (18), such as steroid-free clinical remission (CR) and mucosal healing (16). In addition, after the primary endpoint had been assessed, patients who had undergone mobilization and then been randomized to conventional care were offered auto-HSCT and then followed for a further year with identical assessments as in the randomized trial. Subsequent analysis of the 38 patients who underwent auto-HSCT in the ASTIC program and had data at baseline and 1 year reported a significant reduction in clinical and endoscopic disease activity at 1 year, with 19 out of 38 (50%) patients showing regression of all endoscopic ulceration (17). There were also significant improvements in quality of life between baseline and 1 year after auto-HSCT (17, 19, 20). Importantly, disease recurrence after HSCT responded to the introduction of anti-TNF therapies (15, 17). The doses of cyclophosphamide used in both groups resulted in significant numbers of adverse events and one death (17, 21, 22). Subsequent expert review has suggested that the high dose cyclophosphamide regimen used at both mobilization and conditioning was a factor for many of the adverse events (17, 21, 22). This view is supported by the outcome of an uncontrolled series of 14 patients with refractory Crohn’s disease (CD) who underwent auto-HSCT using a lower dose of cyclophosphamide during mobilization (2 g/m2) and conditioning (50 mg/kg for 4 days). The median duration of anemia and neutropenia was shorter after both mobilization and conditioning than that seen in previous reports using higher cyclophosphamide dosing, and few episodes of febrile neutropenia were reported. The lower intensity regimen still resulted in marked reduction in clinical disease activity with 13 patients achieving disease remission (CDAI < 150) at 30 days (20).",
        "In addition, favorable long-term outcome after auto-HSCT in a single-center cohort of 29 patients with CD (some of whom participated in the ASTIC trial) has been described (23). This includes 5-year follow-up data with scheduled clinical, endoscopic and radiological assessment. Drug-free clinical and endoscopic remission (CDAI < 150, SES-CD < 7) was seen in 61% at 1 year, 52% at 2 years, 47% at 3 years, 39% at 4 years, and 15% at 5 years. However, 80% of those patients who experienced a relapse responded to the re-introduction of anti-TNF therapy. Six out of the 29 underwent surgery after auto-HSCT, and 1 patient died of CMV infection.",
        "The long-term outcomes for all adult patients undergoing auto-HSCT for CD in Europe between 1997 and 2015 (outside the ASTIC study) have been evaluated using the EBMT registry. Clinical data were obtained for 82 patients from 19 centers in 7 countries, with clinical response being categorized as remission (no abdominal pain and normal stool frequency), significant improvement (improved pain and frequency), no change, or worsening of symptoms.",
        "Median follow-up was 41 months (range 6–174). At 100 days post-HSCT, 64% of patients were in CR and a further 28% had experienced significant improvement. At 1 year after transplantation, data from 75 patients indicated that 43% were in CR, 20% improved, 17% unchanged and 20% worsened. 37% patients required surgery after auto-HSCT, and 73% re-started medical therapy. Of those requiring further treatment, 57% responded to therapies to which they had previously been refractory. Treatment-free survival, defined as survival without major surgery or medical therapy, was 27 and 22% at 3 and 5 years respectively.",
        "In addition, the EBMT ADWP has produced a historical summary of the AD section of the registry, which has characterized outcomes following auto-HSCT in various indications. Compared with MS, relapse is more common in CD, which may reflect fundamental differences in disease processes (24).",
        "As of November 2017, there have been a total of 166 transplant registrations for auto-HSCT of CD within the EBMT registry, with the majority 91.5% being in adults over 18 and 24% being treated as part of the ASTIC trial. Patients are predominantly being treated in Spain, UK, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, and France (Figure 1) (source, EBMT Office, Paris).",
        "Registrations per year for the treatment of Crohn’s disease using autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) within the EBMT registry 1994–2017 (note data for 2017 up to November 2017)—numbers treated on the Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease (ASTIC) trial are indicated in blue. Patients have been predominantly treated in Spain, UK, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, and France in reducing order (source EBMT Office, Paris).",
        "Taken together, current experience indicates that auto-HSCT can induce clinical and endoscopic remission, but does not result in sustained treatment-free disease remission in most patients. However, many patients become responsive to treatments to which they were previously refractory. Biomarkers that predict which patients will respond to anti-TNF therapy after auto-HSCT have not been identified and should be a focus of future trials in this area. In addition, auto-HSCT regimens including high dose cyclophosphamide are associated with significant adverse events, which may be avoided with lower intensity regiments. Hence further randomized controlled trials that assess the benefit of lower intensity regimens are warranted.",
        "Specific studies of immune reconstitution in CD patients after auto-HSCT are limited to a few observations (25, 26). Therefore, this review focuses on the general literature relating to immune reconstitution in ADs and highlights how it might be best investigated in patients with CD to identify mechanisms of action of auto-HSCT and gain insights into the pathogenesis of CD.",
        "The original goal of auto-HSCT in ADs was to eradicate existing autoreactive immunological memory and regenerate a naïve, self-tolerant immune system (27, 28). Auto-HSCT has been shown to profoundly impact the immune system, as indicated by the regeneration of naïve B cells (29, 30), thymic reactivation (29, 31–33), the emergence of a polyclonal T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire (29, 31, 33), and restoration of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) (34, 35) and B regulatory cell levels (36). In addition, disease associated restriction of the peripheral blood Treg TCR repertoire is completely reversed by auto-HSCT, both in terms of number and uniqueness of Treg cell TCR sequences (37). Functional assays investigating the fate of autoreactive T cells post-transplantation are limited due to restricted access to such cell clones in human disease compared to animal models. Nevertheless, in vitro stimulation assays in SLE have been able to demonstrate that T cell responses to antinuclear antigens were abolished, whereas virus-specific T cells were readily detectable in the first months after HSCT (29). Likewise, stimulation assays with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptides in auto-HSCT-treated MS patients revealed reduced interleukin-17 responses and enhanced transforming growth factor-β1 production compared to natalizumab-treated patients, suggesting removal of autoreactive T cell clones as well as enhanced suppressive responses after HSCT (38). Collectively, these observations suggest that auto-HSCT has indeed the potential to restore self-tolerance by “resetting” the chronic autoreactive immune system into a naïve state.",
        "Compared with MS and rheumatological diseases, there are relatively little data specifically relating to immune reconstitution following auto-HSCT in CD. The following sections will discuss how components of aberrant immunity may be investigated further in CD.",
        "The intestinal innate immune system not only protects against invading pathogens, it also regulates the interactions between the commensal intestinal microbiota and the host at multiple levels, many of which are altered in CD. A small study investigating the effect of auto-HSCT on the innate immune system in seven patients with moderate to severe CD has reported elevated numbers of peripheral blood TLR-4 expressing monocytes that also express TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma at baseline compared to healthy controls, which were normalized after transplantation (25). The impact of auto-HSCT on other intestinal innate immune populations has not been assessed. Studies on ILCs would be of particular relevance given their role in orchestrating immune defense and regulation at mucosal surfaces and their role in CD pathogenesis.",
        "The increased responses of CD4+ Th17/Th1 cells toward bacterial-derived proteins that have been described in patients with CD suggest a potential mechanism for sustaining persistent disease (39). Elimination of such cells in vivo by immunoablative chemotherapy is presumed to ameliorate intestinal inflammation. Conversely, recurrence of regulatory Foxp3+ Treg cells could restore self-regulation. The first investigation of the impact of auto-HSCT on peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients with CD demonstrated restoration of dysregulated T effector cell responses with a normalization in the number of IFN-gamma-secreting CD4+ T cells together with a significant increase in Foxp3+ Treg cells (25). Interestingly, early restoration of circulating Treg numbers was predictive for treatment response at 3 months post-transplantation.",
        "The extensive immune renewal that follows auto-HSCT is associated with a vast diversification of the TCR repertoire. For example, in MS, CD4+ T cell dominant TCR clones that were present in peripheral blood before treatment were undetectable after immune reconstitution, with patients predominantly developing a new repertoire. More importantly, the T cell repertoire early during the reconstitution process were less diverse in patients who failed to respond to treatment (40). However, these data were exclusively obtained from peripheral blood and not from the site of inflammation. By contrast, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the TCRβ locus in ileal and colonic biopsies collected at baseline (pre-mobilization) and after auto-HSCT (6 months and/or 1 year after transplantation) has been used to correlate TCR diversity with clinical and endoscopic outcome in 16 patients with CD (26). Quantifying repertoire similarities of T cell clones at different time points were quantified by the Morisita–Horn index (M–H; range 0–1) revealed monoclonal expansions in the mucosal T cell compartment at baseline prior to HSCT. The TCR repertoire was more polyclonal than expected (500 to 20,000 unique TCR sequences, clonality index 0.1 to 0.3), with no shared public TCR sequences being apparent in the mucosa of different patients. The clonality of the TCR in the mucosa was significantly increased after HSCT and the T cell repertoire appears reset, as the similarity index between baseline and after the procedure was low (26).",
        "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is given both to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells and to accelerate neutrophil recovery post auto-HSCT. However, it can profoundly affect innate and adaptive immunity by inducing the differentiation of type 1 Treg cells and tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) (41). Clinical benefit from G-CSF was reported in five patients with severe endoscopic postoperative recurrence of CD who received 300 µg of recombinant human G-CSF three times per week for 12 consecutive weeks (42). Administration of G-CSF was safe and associated with significant increases in neutrophil counts, and levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist and soluble TNF receptor p55 and p75.",
        "A clinical trial in nine patients with CD at the USA National Institutes of Health confirmed the potential benefit of subcutaneous G-CSF given over a 4-week period (43). In this study, changes in immune cell phenotypes, including myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs, as well as cytokine production were measured in the peripheral blood and colonic mucosal tissues. Patients who responded to G-CSF or achieved CR had significantly more IL-10-producing CD4+ memory T cells in the periphery, as well as a greatly enhanced CD123+ plasmacytoid DC infiltration of the lamina propria. Interestingly, IFN-γ production was higher in non-responders to G-CSF compared with responders. Although a randomized controlled placebo trial has not yet been performed, these studies suggest that G-CSF per se might offer some therapeutic benefit for patients with CD. Whether stem cell mobilization with G-CSF affects the functional orientation of immune cell populations in patients with CD and whether G-CSF-mobilized immune cell subsets, such as Treg cells and/or plasmacytoid DCs, favor the re-establishment of immune tolerance after auto-HSCT remains to be evaluated.",
        "It is essential to determine whether there is a real “reset” of autoimmunity following auto-HSCT for CD, as has been observed for multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus and which forms the basis for treatment-free remissions, or simply a temporary downregulation of innate and acquired immune responses. The relapse rate in CD after auto-HSCT is considerably higher compared to other ADs, which could be related to an insufficient eradication of the autoreactive immunologic memory by the conditioning regimens applied and/or a more prominent genetic contribution that favors disease recurrence. The latter fact is supported by epidemiologic studies demonstrating concordance rates among monozygotic twins of up to 50% (44). Alternatively, failure of achieving durable treatment-free remissions in CD post-transplantation could indicate that aberrant adaptive autoimmune responses and formation of a pathogenic immunologic memory are not the driving force in disease pathogenesis, as confirmed for other systemic ADs. In fact, perturbations in the innate immune pathway resulting in compromised mucosal barrier functions may have a stronger implication in driving chronic autoimmune responses in CD, which may not be corrected by “resetting” the immune system with auto-HSCT. Data supporting these considerations are not available yet, as studies investigating the influence of intestinal epithelial barrier changes on the dysfunction of mucosal innate and acquired immune responses after auto-HSCT in patients with CD are lacking.",
        "Guidelines and expert recommendations to develop and implement systematic approaches to monitor immune responses in patients with cancer have been recently published (45). Likewise, the EBMT Autoimmune Diseases and Immunobiology Working Parties have initiated a joint process to develop and implement guidelines for “good laboratory practice” to provide practical recommendations for biobanking and immune monitoring in patients with ADs undergoing HSCT (46). The analysis of biological specimens at the cellular, DNA, transcriptional, epigenetic, posttranscriptional, and protein levels, including peripheral blood and tissues, yields a massive amount of data, which need to be processed with novel bioinformatics methods.",
        "For the analysis of TCR repertoire, several different approaches and methods exist. The approach to be used is dependent on the experimental questions being asked and methodological bias can make it difficult to compare results across different studies. The latest advances, available tools, the choice of starting material, and the method for preparing samples have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (47). Most of the approaches involve the analysis of samples at the molecular level, commonly using deep and NGS (47).",
        "Comprehensive protocols relating to multi-parameter flow cytometric analysis have been published previously (48, 49). In the future, such conventional flow cytometry may be combined with methods providing higher resolution, such as cytometry by time of flight mass spectrometry, as has already been used by Karnell and colleagues to investigate the kinetics of immune cell subset reconstitution in the periphery after HSCT and the impact of HSCT on the phenotype of circulating T cells in patients with MS (50). In addition, cytometric profiling may be complemented by an innovative flow cytometry approach which combines three monoclonal antibodies with two fluorophores to quantitate the TCR Vβ repertoire of human T lymphocytes (IOTest® Beta Mark TCR V-beta Repertoire Kit, Beckman Coulter).",
        "T cell reconstitution after successful HSCT can occur via a thymic-independent pathway, which involves the expansion of graft-derived mature donor T cells, or a thymic-dependent pathway, the consequence of which is a regeneration of T cells with a more diverse TCR repertoire from graft-derived precursor cells (51). As thymic function is required for the de novo generation of T cells after transplantation, the potential function of T lymphopoiesis after auto-HSCT can be determined by quantifying TRECs (52). Signal joint TCR excision DNA circles (sjTRECs) result from the rearrangement of the TCR gene and the excision of circular DNA fragments from genomic DNA during thymocyte development. Measuring thymic function by quantifying sjTRECs in peripheral blood avoids disadvantages that are associated with the use of T cell surface molecules, such as CD45RA, as markers for recent thymic emigrants (RTEs). sjTRECs reflect developmental proximity to the thymus and the analysis of total sjTRECs levels and TCR beta variable region (TRBV) subfamily sjTRECs frequencies during immune reconstitution after HSCT is useful for more precisely determining thymic output function and T cell immune reconstitution (53). Although such analyses have not yet been undertaken in the context of CD, the increased precision of this approach has the potential to provide a more robust insight into the relationship(s) between immune status, disease status, and therapeutic resistance after auto-HSCT.",
        "Gene expression profiles reflect the immune milieu and are increasingly being used for immune monitoring purposes and identifying predictive biomarkers in patients with cancer. Microarrays have traditionally supported the high-throughput analysis of gene and miRNA expression, but they are limited by the requirement for relatively large quantities of high-quality RNA. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become an important discovery tool, and the preferred choice for unbiased biomarker discovery of transcriptional signatures associated with disease activity, treatment outcomes, and mechanism of action studies of therapeutic agents. However, data analysis and interpretation require advanced bioinformatics approaches. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) provides a more accurate insight into gene expression than microarrays and requires lower amounts of RNA. However, the analysis of the expression of multiple genes with classical qPCR and digital PCR, which can also be used for high-throughput high-precision analysis, is more difficult.",
        "NanoString-based molecular “bar coding” enables the high-throughput analysis of the expression of multiple genes using defined panels such as the nCounter™ Human Immunology, Human Inflammation, and Human Myeloid Innate Immunity Panels. The Human Immunology module could be particularly relevant to the post-HSCT immune monitoring of patients with CD, given that the ASTIC trial reported treatment-related infections to be the most frequent serious adverse events during the 100 days after conditioning and the subsequent follow-up (17). The NanoString nCounter™ analysis system detects the expression of up to 800 genes in a single reaction with high sensitivity and linearity across a broad range of expression levels (54). The platform utilizes digital detection and direct molecular barcoding of individual target molecules using fluorescently labeled capture and reporter probes incorporating 35- to 50-base target-specific sequences. This technology allows for direct, PCR amplification-free multiplexed measurements of gene expression from a low amount of mRNA (25–300 ng). Different sources of RNA, including total RNA, fragmented RNA and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)-derived RNA, can be used. This approach is suitable for the discovery of gene expression signatures, their validation and diagnostic testing in large translational studies.",
        "Given that reduced intensity mobilization and conditioning regimens are associated with lower morbidity in malignant and AD (20, 55–58), the hypothesis that auto-HSCT using a reduced dose cyclophosphamide mobilization and low intensity conditioning (HSCTlite) will induce regression of ileocolonic ulceration in patients with refractory CD compared to standard of care will be tested via a soon-to-commence clinical trial (ASTIClite). This UK NIHR-funded national multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial aims to recruit 99 patients with a 2:1 randomization to compare HSCTlite with standard of care. For this, eligible outpatients with treatment refractory CD will be randomized to auto-HSCT with cyclophosphamide 1 g/m2 + G-CSF for mobilization followed by transplant conditioning with fludarabine 125 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg, and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin 7.5 mg/kg (total doses) versus standard of care and followed for 48 weeks. The reduced doses of cyclophosphamide in the mobilization and conditioning regimens are based on the concerns raised following the single case of TRM in the original ASTIC trial, which may have been related to cumulative toxicity from higher mobilization dose of cyclophosphamide (4 g/m2) followed by the transplant conditioning (21, 22). It is hoped that this measure will improve overall safety and reduce the likelihood of neutropenic sepsis during the mobilization phase, which may be performed as an outpatient procedure.",
        "The standard care group will be able to receive any licensed biologic, immunosuppressive or nutritional therapy for CD at the discretion of the treating physician. Pre-specified interim analyses will be undertaken to confirm that the mobilization regimen is effective for stem cell harvest with no negative impact on disease activity. Colonoscopy and MRI at week 24 will assess the requirement for re-initiation of maintenance of anti-TNF therapy in those with evidence of disease activity post auto-HSCT. Immunological profiling of blood and mucosa before and after HSCTlite will identify its mechanism of action. It is expected that HSCTlite will have an acceptable side-effect profile.",
        "Additional secondary clinical endpoints will be the impact of HSCTlite on clinical disease activity, steroid requirements, quality of life, and the presence of adverse/serious adverse events, as compared to standard of care [and historical HSCT, as observed in ASTIC (16, 17)]. Exploratory endpoints will be the safety and efficacy of maintenance anti-TNF therapy in those patients with the recurrence of endoscopic disease after HSCTlite.",
        "At the core of this study is comprehensive and informative immunological profiling of the periphery and mucosa before and after treatment (Figure 2). Profiling will be focused on generating insight into the pathogenesis of CD, the responsiveness, and restoration of responsiveness to anti-TNF therapy in patients with endoscopic disease recurrence and the immunological events that precede recurrence of disease and occurrence of resistance to anti-TNF therapy in patients that relapse after auto-HSCT.",
        "Proposed approach to immune monitoring in the Autologous Stem cell Transplantation In refractory CD—Low Intensity Therapy Evaluation clinical trial. Immune reconstitution will be evaluated using patient-derived blood mononuclear cells at weeks 8 12, 24, 32, and 48 after infusion autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Multi-color flow cytometry and optimized multicolor immunofluorescence-like antibody panels will be used to assess the general immune status of the patients, as well as the ability to release immune regulatory cytokines at the single-cell level. Mucosal biopsies will be assessed at baseline, weeks 24 and 48. RNA will be extracted and will be analyzed on a NanoString FLEX™ gene expression profiling platform, as detailed in the main text. Additional studies could employ a multiplexed spatial protein profiling approach based on NanoString digital quantification of tissue proteins to generate a digital replica of the immune topography of intestinal biopsies and to gain mechanistic insights into the immune determinants of response after autologous HSCT, with emphasis on the reconstitution of plasmacytoid DCs, regulatory T cells, and TCR-Vβ repertoires. Abbreviations: G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; Cy, cyclophosphamide; Flu, fludarabine; PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; FFPE, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded; IHC, immunohistochemistry.",
        "Reconstitution of immune potential is being monitored by determining the re-appearance of monocyte subsets, T cell subsets (“helper,” “cytotoxic,” naïve, central memory, effector memory, regulatory, RTEs), B cell subsets, and NK cell subsets (cytokine-secreting CD3−CD56brightCD16+/− and cytotoxic; CD3−CD56dimCD16+) using multi-parameter flow cytometry. Representative panels that can be used for the monitoring of immune reconstitution in patients with CD following auto-HSCT are summarized in Table 1, the ability to deliver which will be dependent on the instrumentation available in the analytical laboratory. Comprehensive protocols relating to flow cytometric analysis have been published previously (48, 49).",

        "aCD4 differentiation and helper subsets can be gated upon after Foxp3+CD25hiCD127low Treg cells have been excluded from the CD4+ T cell parent population.",
        "Combined with post-transplant vaccination, the immune reconstitution of “ASTIClite” will therefore aim to establish whether the effect of AHSCT is merely temporary downregulation of immunity or whether there is a significant component of immune reset.",
        "Based on clinical trials and EBMT registry data, auto-HSCT represents a promising therapy for patients with severe resistant CD. Prolonged responses have been achieved in some patients that have otherwise been resistant to conventional treatments and biological therapies. In the patients who relapse, there appears to be a re-sensitization to previous agents, consistent with a “setting back of the immunological clock.” Previous clinical trials and case series report a relatively high relapse rate and high frequency of serious adverse events. Future trials will assess the efficacy and safety of lower intensity mobilization and conditioning regimens and the benefit of protocoled introduction of maintenance therapy in patients who relapse after auto-HSCT.",
        "In addition, clinical trials of auto-HSCT provide a unique opportunity to characterize the nature of immune reconstitution as well as the interaction between the peripheral and mucosal immune system in CD. This will allow deep interrogation and characterization of the localized mucosal immune environment in patients with disease before and after auto-HSCT during ASTIClite, as well as the immunome of the periphery (by profiling peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs) before and after auto-HSCT and during the progression toward disease relapse.",
        "Recently, the EBMT and European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation have published a review to encourage and guide inter-specialty collaboration in both clinical and scientific development of this auto-HSCT in CD (59). Thus, in addition to therapeutic benefits, destroying and re-building the dysfunctional immune system and mucosal environment, a program of modern scientific investigation carefully scheduled around auto-HSCT may yield valuable insights into the etiology, pathogenesis, and mechanisms of treatment resistance in CD.",

At present, advances in cellular technologies have stirred growing interest in the use of autologous cell treatments aimed to regain urinary control. The objective was to conduct a review of the literature and analyse preclinical and clinical studies dedicated to various cell therapies for SUI, assessing their effectiveness, safety, and future prospects. A systematic literature search in PubMed was conducted using the following key terms: \"stem,\" \"cell,\" \"stress,\" \"urinary,\" and \"incontinence.\" A total of 32 preclinical studies and 15 clinical studies published between 1946 and December 2014 were included in the review. Most preclinical trials have used muscle-derived stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells. However, at present, the application of other types of cells, such as human amniotic fluid stem muscle-derived progenitor cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells, is becoming more extensive. While the evidence shows that these therapies are effective and safe, further work is required to standardize surgical techniques, as well as to identify indications for their use, doses and number of doses. Future research will have to focus on clinical applications of cell therapies; namely, it will have to determine indications for their use, doses of cells, optimal surgical techniques and methods, attractive cell sources, as well as to develop clinically relevant animal models and make inroads into understanding the mechanisms of SUI improvement by cell therapies.

For some, regenerative medicine may even make AUS technology obsolete.",
        "Efforts to augment sphincter function to ameliorate stress urinary incontinence (SUI) likely predate our first official record of an occlusive periurethral cuff described by Foley in 1947 (1). The contemporary iteration of the artificial urinary sphincter (AUS), the AS721, was first implanted in 1973, interestingly in a female myelomeningocele patient (2). The AS721 was the first commercially available implantable sphincter to create circumferential pressure around the urethra or bladder neck designed to restrict incontinence secondary to sphincter deficiency. The technology was born in intense collaboration between urology, neurology, and engineering. This basic mechanism, involving a cuff, a reservoir, an inflation pump, and a deflation pump, evolved out of decades of substantial effort on bulbourethral compression balloons and the application of silicone elastomers originally developed for the space program (3,4). The AUS has endured through time as the gold standard treatment for male SUI.",
        "While several contemporary innovations in AUS technology have improved both device efficacy and complication rates, the basic technology in use in Boston Scientific’s AMS800 can be traced back to the fundamental hydraulic tenets of the AS721 (5). Even the components of the AMS800 differ only in the replacement of the AS721’s deflation pump with the AMS800’s pressure-regulating balloon (PRB). When the scrotal pump of the AMS800, which lies in series between the cuff and the PRB, is cycled, it pumps fluid into the PRB against its native pressure gradient, thereby drawing fluid out of the urethral cuff. The PRB then passively empties fluid back into the urethral cuff via the scrotal pump as it returns to its resting pressure (6). Research and development in adaptive technology and electronic integration to automate some of the AMS800’s manual mechanisms stand to further improve AUS outcomes and widen its surgical indications in the coming decades. Finally, novel regenerative therapies aim to eventually replace the AUS through the repair and replacement of damaged native urinary sphincter musculature. We present this article in accordance with the Narrative Review reporting checklist (available at https://tau.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/tau-22-858/rc).",
        "The Medline online retrieval system was queried using the MeSH terms “artificial urinary sphincter”, “electronic”, “complications”, “history”, and “development” in various combinations to identify articles for this narrative review. Publications were reviewed if applicable, and their reference lists were used to collect additional articles as needed. Final article inclusion was based on senior author discretion. Articles not primarily written in English or with an available translation were excluded. A search strategy summary can be found in Table 1.",
        "The fundamental aspects of the AUS have endured through the decades, enhancing the quality of life for a vast number of patients. Given the efficacy and durability of the foundational design, contemporary AUS innovation has expanded to include further improving the user experience and increasing the eligible patient population. As such, some thoughtful discourse was promoted by the AUS Consensus Group outlining potential features of an “ideal” AUS to include:",
        "Easy manipulation and deactivation;",
        "Modifiable urethral cuff pressure following implantation;",
        "Adaptive cuff pressure;",
        "Simple, robust design;",
        "Minimally-invasive implantation;",
        "Cost-effective (7).",
        "One of the essential components the committee outlined for the “ideal” AUS included improved ease of manipulation for both patients and caregivers. Currently, patients and caregivers cycle and deactivate an implanted AUS through manual subcutaneous pump manipulation, which can be limited by both poor or deteriorating dexterity or cognitive function (8). This is often difficult due to the mobility of the pump under lax scrotal skin. It can be painful if not cycled gently and can be both physically challenging and embarrassing for less experienced caregivers. AUS control via an electronic remote or smartphone application would reduce the burden of decreased patient dexterity or cognitive function.",
        "Remote AUS control would also open the door for a more customizable device. The current sphincter allows for cuff pressure adjustment at the time of implantation through multiple options for the resting cuff pressure, mediated by the PRB. However, postoperatively, the urethral cuff will always reflect the static pressure generated by the chosen PRB when not actively being cycled or deactivated. Remote control of the device with an electronic interface may allow for the utilization of both timed/scheduled cuff-pressure mediation as well as activity-responsive cuff pressures. Allowing patient control over timed deactivation, or even a “low pressure” mode would give the urethra a release from the tonal pressure of the current AUS without sacrificing incontinence outcomes as the patient would be able to time the decreased cuff pressure during periods of supine rest. Adaptive cuff pressure adjustments would work in reverse, sensing increased intraabdominal pressures and temporarily increasing the AUS cuff pressure to reduce leakage in times of high exertion. Although data regarding the benefits of selective deactivation or adaptive cuff pressures are early and inconclusive, the concept of selective deactivation and adaptive cuff pressures may theoretically improve device survival without a decrease in efficacy (9). Both of the features were cited by the panel as necessary in the “ideal” AUS.",
        "Focus on improving mechanical longevity has been another area of focus in AUS innovation. Although the current AMS800 enjoys incredible durability for a decades-old design, the short-term complication rate of AUS implantation is reportedly as high as 21% based on surgical approach. Most complications are associated with known intraoperative or postoperative events such as hematoma formation and wound infection (10). Linder et al. demonstrated in an AUS cohort with a median follow-up of 4.1 years, that the most frequently reported long-term complication was mechanical failure in 14.8% of patients (11). While less common, device infections and erosions (8.2%) and sub-cuff urethral atrophy (8.2%) often present in follow-up as recurrent incontinence. Although infections, erosions, and atrophy can be treated with device removal and replacement, long-term lower urinary tract dysfunction secondary to erosions and infections can persist and even potentiate end-stage-bladder in rare cases (12).",
        "While historical reports indicate that all-cause rates of revision increase by 5% for every year the device has been implanted, Deruyver et al. recently described a revision-free device survival rate of 62% at 5 years (13). In a 2015 meta-analysis, the average revision rate was increased by almost 20% (19.8% to 37.3%) for patients with a history of prior radiation, but more recent studies report the difference in device survival rates to be much smaller, albeit still significant (14,15). These improvements in more contemporary cohorts may be secondary to improved surgical technique (e.g., “no-touch technique”) or device improvements (e.g., inhibizone coating).",
        "Given the high patient satisfaction rate for the AUS, patients commonly opt for device revision in the setting of mechanical failures or complications (16). Reports comparing outcomes of primary AUS implantation versus revisions have demonstrated that although device survival may decrease for revisions (61% vs. 74% at 5 years), patient satisfaction remains exceptionally high (17). The AUS Consensus Conference suggested efforts to decrease mechanical dysfunction may include one-piece, pre-filled devices to limit discrepancies in techniques as well as exploration of non-hydraulic mechanisms of action.",
        "Minimally invasive surgical approaches have become the norm for many aspects of Urology, including Reconstructive Urology. Because most perioperative complications are thought to stem from technical surgical errors, technical adaptations to reduce human error may also be at the forefront of AUS innovation (10). Endeavoring to advance robotic procedures for bladder neck placement, thereby decreasing skin incisions for perineal placement was brought to the forefront by the committee.",
        "Finally, in the era of cost containment in medicine, the promotion of devices with the least economic burden to the health system should be considered (7). Widespread adoption of such technologies will then be feasible from a global perspective, allowing service to many marginalized populations with limited access to innovation. In addition to these market factors, variations in government regulations have allowed innovative devices to emerge in select markets, making vigilance for prosthetic surgeons and their patients regarding outcomes even more pronounced (18).",
        "A staggering array of possibilities exist to enhance the current occlusive artificial sphincter prosthesis. An exceptional and comprehensive evaluation of the engineering design parameters for the spectrum of commercially available unconventional activation technologies is presented by Marziale et al. with select devices and additional emerging technologies outlined in the following section (19).",
        "While the experience with the innovative devices outlined below in human subjects is limited, it promises the potential of exciting new advancements in AUS technology. Should the improved AUS features deliver on their potential, the ability of the cuff to sense pressure exerted upon the urethra and the freedom of implanters to modify the fluid volume in-office may enhance both the efficacy and mechanical longevity of the device. With patient-centered developments in remote activation of the pump via a wireless interface on the horizon, patient adoption and ease of utilization will undoubtedly expand. However, the added complexities of electronic integration with developing AUS technology may increase the risks of complications or new types of electromechanical malfunction. Contemporary developments in AUS technology are outlined below and in Table 2.",
        "AUS, artificial urinary sphincter; GASS, German artificial sphincter system.",
        "Capitalizing on technological innovations such as Bluetooth communication, novel designs for the classic hydraulic mechanical sphincter with regard to remote control alternatives were pioneered by the Montreal group in 2017 (20). Three distinct options for modifications of the control system of the current AUS were explored, preserving the occlusive cuff and PRB. In these designs, in lieu of the system that transmits pressure, the balloon serves only as a fluid reservoir. In sophisticated in vitro and ex vivo model systems, the authors pioneered pump systems that would be compatible to retrofit onto the current AUS800. The first concept (termed AUS #1) was designed to replace the pump with a unidirectional, magnetically controlled pump. A piezoelectric micropump and hydraulic resistor are mounted in parallel with a primary lithium battery designed to last for 16 years with an average of 7 micturition cycles per day. The sphincter is operated by advancing a small neodymium magnet to the switch and is confirmed with sound. Several prior magnetically actuated devices have been proposed; however, such technologies may be limited by the ease of utilization, efficacy, and lack of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibility (21).",
        "A second iteration was proposed with the manual pump in parallel for dual safety parameters allowing both manual and electromagnetic deactivation (20). Designated AUS #2, this device integrates a Bluetooth communicating microcontroller to actuate a latched microvalve. The rechargeable lithium battery for this unit is designed for a 41-day life span between charges. This system is additionally designed to be mounted in parallel with the traditional scrotal pump. The third system, AUS #3, is both remote-controlled and adaptive to alterations in transmitted pressure (20). The device incorporates continuous pressure regulation, wireless communication, and a wireless power delivery system based on an inductive power standard. A centrifugal pump and latched solenoid microvalve deliver capacity via Bluetooth integration for fast pump cycling via the reservoir of fluid housed in the PRB. The rechargeable lithium battery associated with AUS #3 has a theoretical lifespan of 10 months between charges. Each of these devices was tested and determined to display appropriate functionality and pressure transmission with in vitro and an ex vivo pig bladder model. All three iterations of the AUS control pumps were able to sustain appropriate occlusive cuff pressures and are a powerful platform for further innovation to retrofit onto the contemporary AMS800 pump and PRB.",
        "Exciting progress is evolving regarding the UroMems artificial urinary sphincter (eAUS, UroActive™), a novel implantable with a wireless control component. In addition to allowing remote operation, the system is a genuine active implantable, employing a technology termed myo-electrical mechanical system (MEMS) to accommodate transmitted urethral pressures dependent on patient activity. Preclinical data was presented in an animal model with 14 implants (22). The control unit for the device, which is composed of a reservoir, automatic pump, and electronic components, was placed in a right-sided submuscular location. Outside of a solitary infection, no device-related complications were noted with function noted for all implants.",
        "Adjunct data on urodynamic parameters in human cadavers compared the UroMems device to the AMS800 (23). Mean urethral closure pressures in this model accommodated ranges covered by the entire suite of PRBs for the AMS800, demonstrating wide latitude in the ability to set and modify the occlusive pressure of the UroMems sphincter to tailor for an individual patient.",
        "The prospective open-label feasibility trial designed to enroll 6 adult males and assess safety and efficacy was opened in the fall of 2022 with multiple sites in France. (First-in-human Study to Assess the UrOMems Artificial Urinary sPHincter In the treAtment of Stress Incontinence, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05547672).",
        "With the concept of electronically modulated intermittent urethral compression, the ARTUS™ (Affluent Medical SA, Aix-en-Provence, France) device has undergone pre-clinical testing, including cadaver implantation in both genders (24-26). The adaptive cuff responds to changes in abdominal pressure and is manipulated with an external remote control. The modular system is based on the development of shape-memory alloys (SMA) which are capable of shape alterations based on temperatures. The sphincter consists of multiple wires placed along the urethra which exert variable and periodic compression to allow areas of rest and theoretically diminish complications associated with chronic pressure-related changes resulting in ischemia and allow tailoring to patient requirements accomplished via physician programming at follow-up (27). The first feasibility trial of the device included 3 female patients with temporary bladder neck implants which completed enrollment in 2018. (Feasibility of ARTUS MONO Artificial Urinary Sphincter Implant in Women, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03703843). Affluent Medical is embarking upon a complex clinical trial for bulbar urethral implantation for regulatory approval with current sites in Spain and Czechia, although records at the time of this writing indicated the study is not yet recruiting. [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04827199, Safety and Clinical Performance Study of the ARTUS® AUS (DRY)]. Of note, this final device is not MRI-compatible, which may limit utility in certain populations.",
        "Multiple iterations of a teleautomatic prosthesis for both urinary and fecal indications have been pioneered as the GASS (28). The device pump is driven by piezoelectric crystals which can be induced to change physical form, thereby activating the hydraulic mechanism, based on the application of an electrical stimulus via the battery. This integrated, modular, electronically actuated device has an admirable range of potential applications and is currently being developed first for fecal stress incontinence. The current iteration, GASS III, incorporates all the components, the micropump, regulator, microprocessor, batteries, and telemetric control components, into a single casing (29). The advantage of this “all-in-one” implant lies in the ease of implantation surgery which involves no tubing or component connections, decreasing the opportunity for intraoperative complications and subsequent mechanical failure (30). Pilot in vitro studies are encouraging and translation of the engineering feats to patient application is eagerly anticipated.",
        "In cooperation with the Fraunhofer Research Institution for modular solid-state technologies (EMFT), Dualis Medtech (Seefeld, Germany) has been endeavoring for a decade to develop an electronic pump for the AUS. Based on the company’s proprietary wireless energy and data transfer technologies, the device has promise for automatic pressure adjustments. Published data regarding the device is not currently available, but the patent application granted in 2018 (patent number: 10154892) indicates that in addition to the electrical pump, a second emergency pump is incorporated as a safety measure.",
        "Although not an electronically actuated device, the FlowSecure AUS does offer pressure-sensing technology which may serve as a platform for other technologies. The FlowSecure AUS relies on a similar apparatus to Boston Scientifics AMS800 save for a second PRB (“Stress relief balloon”) lying in series with the rest of the hydraulic system. This second balloon is placed pre-peritoneally and transmits transient increases in intraabdominal pressure, reflected due to its proximity to the peritoneal space, to the AUS cuff. The FlowSecure device is also designed for in-office fluid adjustments to tailor to specific patient continence severity and boasts an “all-in-one” design that requires no tubing connections during placement (31). Unfortunately despite multiple potential improvements over the AMS800, data on the efficacy and durability of FlowSecure devices is lacking without a report within the last 10 years.",
        "The current AMS800 device is manufactured by Boston Scientific who acquired the technology upon the dissolution of American Medical Systems. Although there is sparse information publicly available regarding their electronic AUS program, the company reports they have made significant investments to develop the technology, and working prototypes of the eAUS have been manufactured and tested (personal communication). Notably, baseline information regarding the efficacy and safety of the current iteration of the device is fundamental to allowing innovation in the current regulatory environment. As such, a large-scale clinical trial has just completed enrollment, potentially in anticipation of setting parameters appropriate for eAUS trials and eventual approval in the United States [Artificial Urinary Sphincter Clinical Outcomes (AUSCO) ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04088331].",
        "From a design perspective, future innovations may implement materials and technologies that more accurately replicate the function of the native urinary sphincter. Contemporary research and development have been generally focused on alternative methods of device activation to take advantage of novel electronic pressure sensing, pumps, and actuators which can be coupled with wireless technology. Additionally, numerous energy innovations will likely drive future development. Recent innovations include the development of a phantom model demonstrating a unidirectional communication path for an active implantable AUS that is responsive to human signals such as discrete pressure on the abdominal wall for activation (32).",
        "The newest frontier of therapy for SUI centers on regenerative medicine with cell-based therapies. Stem cell therapies have the potential to restore the external sphincter (striated muscle) and internal sphincter (smooth muscle), as well as the neuromuscular synapse and blood supply (33).",
        "Stem cells are the foundation of cell-based strategies and are categorized as either embryonic or adult stem cells (34). As there is continued scientific and ethical debate regarding the use of pluripotent embryonic stem cells, current cell-based therapies proposed for SUI utilize somatic multipotent stem cells derived from various adult tissue types. These cells are terminally differentiated and serve as progenitor cells for the renewal of local tissues in situ. Several different cell types have been considered in SUI management in both animal and human studies, including bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, adipose-derived stem cells, umbilical cord blood stem cells, autologous total nucleated cells, and muscle-derived cells (35).",
        "Contemporary clinical trials for urinary incontinence involve the injection of stem cells into the striated urethral sphincter with the goal of regeneration of the natural continence mechanism. As opposed to our current treatment options for SUI which manage the symptoms, the aim of cell-based therapies is to truly reverse the primary pathophysiology of intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) thereby treating the cause of SUI.",
        "Most research and clinical trials regarding regenerative cell-based therapy for SUI have focused on autologous muscle-derived cells for urethral sphincter regeneration (AMDC-USR). Autologous muscle-derived cells are harvested from skeletal muscle and delivered back into the external urethral sphincter after ex vivo expansion with the goal of regenerating the muscle, thereby restoring function and continence. Although the technology is nearing commercial application for female stress incontinence, AMDC-USR for male SUI following prostatectomy is currently undergoing preliminary investigation (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02291432) (36,37).",
        "The future of male SUI therapy includes technological advancements that will expand the eligibility for AUS implantation as well as increase device safety, efficacy, and longevity. For some, regenerative medicine may even make AUS technology obsolete. Such savvy technologic enhancements will inevitably deliver a positive impact on men with SUI and continue to substantially improve quality of life for decades to come.",

        "Cancer remains one of the most formidable challenges in modern medicine, with conventional treatments such as radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery often hindered by issues like lack of personalized approaches, significant adverse reactions, tumor heterogeneity, and the development of drug resistance (1, 2). Cell therapy, tracing its origins to the 19th century, has significantly evolved from the initial injections of animal materials to sophisticated human cell-based treatments, most notably bone marrow transplants (3). Immunotherapy, a subset of cell therapy, enhances the body’s immune system to recognize and combat cancer cells, showing remarkable promise across various cancer types (4).",
        "Key immune cells, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and cytotoxic T cells, target tumor-specific antigens, driving the development of therapies such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferons, and investigational agents like IL-2 and chemokines, which are advancing through clinical trials (5, 6). While cell therapy offers precise tumor targeting, immune system enhancement, and potential long-term anticancer effects, it also faces challenges such as drug resistance, immune suppression, adverse reactions, and risks like infections (7). Moreover, clinical studies are still in early stages for many therapies, and the complex, costly production processes limit widespread application (8). This manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive overview of cell-based immunotherapies, focusing on CAR-T, CAR-NK, and TCR-T therapies, and discusses the challenges and future prospects in their application to solid tumors, as shown in \nFigure 1\n.",
        "Mechanisms of myeloid, NK, TCR, and CAR-based cell therapies in TME.",
        "CAR-T therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies, showing remarkable efficacy in diseases like acute lymphoblastic leukemia and certain types of lymphoma (9). However, its translation to solid tumors has proven much more challenging. Similarly, Chimeric Antigen Receptor Natural Killer (CAR-NK) cell therapy has emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging the innate cytotoxic capabilities of NK cells to target cancer cells. Unlike T cells, NK cells offer benefits such as a lower risk of graft-versus-host disease and potentially fewer severe side effects (10). Despite these advantages, CAR-NK therapy also faces significant obstacles, particularly in treating solid tumors. This section explores the primary challenges encountered by both CAR-T and CAR-NK cell therapies in solid tumors, highlights recent studies addressing these issues, and discusses potential solutions currently under investigation.",
        "Solid tumors exhibit significant antigen heterogeneity, complicating the selection of suitable target antigens for CAR-T cells. Unlike hematologic cancers with universally expressed targets like CD19, solid tumors often lack such definitive markers, increasing the risk of antigen escape (10). Recent studies demonstrate that dual-targeting CAR-T cells, engineered to recognize two different antigens, can reduce antigen escape (11). For instance, CAR-T cells targeting both HER2 and IL13Rα2 in glioblastoma have shown improved efficacy (12). Tandem CARs, which incorporate two antigen-binding domains within a single molecule, also enhance the ability to target heterogeneous tumor cells (13). Similarly, solid tumors present antigen heterogeneity challenges for CAR-NK therapy. Dual-targeting CAR-NK cells have been engineered to target multiple antigens, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing antigen escape. For example, CAR-NK cells targeting both HER2 and EGFR in breast cancer have shown enhanced efficacy compared to single-target cells (14). Bispecific and trispecific CAR-NK cells, and universal CAR platforms, offer flexibility to target different antigens without generating new constructs (15).",
        "CAR structural components impact efficacy, persistence, and safety. The scFv is the antigen-binding domain, defining specificity and affinity (16). High-affinity scFvs improve targeting but may increase off-tumor toxicity. The hinge region connects scFv to the transmembrane domain, influencing flexibility and stability (17). A longer hinge aids clustering but may raise toxicity risk. The transmembrane domain anchors the CAR, affecting stability and expression. Co-stimulatory domains like CD28 and 4-1BB are key for T cell activation and persistence. CD28 boosts initial activation but may cause exhaustion and CRS. 4-1BB supports sustained activation and long-term persistence but may slow early responses. Combining these domains optimizes CAR efficacy and safety (18).",
        "Gene delivery methods are key to the efficiency, safety, and scalability of CAR therapies. Viral vectors (e.g., lentiviruses, retroviruses) provide high transduction efficiency and stable CAR expression but carry risks like insertional mutagenesis and immune responses (19). Lentiviral vectors are preferred for long-term expression, though mutagenesis remains a concern. Non-viral systems (e.g., Sleeping Beauty) offer high transfection efficiency without genome integration, reducing mutagenesis risk, but have lower efficiency than viral vectors, impacting production scale and CAR consistency (20). Electroporation can induce cell stress and reduce viability (21). Balancing efficiency, safety, and scalability is crucial, especially for treating solid tumors.",
        "TME in solid tumors is highly immunosuppressive, characterized by regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and inhibitory cytokines like TGF-β and IL-10, which impair CAR-T cell function and persistence (22). Recent studies have shown that armored CAR-T cells, engineered to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 or IL-18, can counteract immunosuppressive signals, improving CAR-T cell efficacy (23). Additionally, combining CAR-T therapy with checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies has enhanced CAR-T cell activity within the TME (24). CAR-NK cells also encounter similar immunosuppressive factors in the TME, including Tregs, MDSCs, and inhibitory cytokines (25). To enhance CAR-NK therapy, armored CAR-NK cells have been engineered to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-15 or express dominant-negative receptors to counteract immunosuppressive signals in the TME (26). Combining CAR-NK therapy with checkpoint inhibitors has been shown to improve CAR-NK cell activity within the tumor (27). Genetic modifications to produce supportive cytokines, chemokines, or receptors, and to eliminate immunosuppressive cells like Tregs and MDSCs, are being explored to improve CAR-NK cell function (28).",
        "In hematologic malignancies, the TME supports CAR-T cell expansion, activation, and persistence with cytokines like IL-2 and IL-15, which promote T cell proliferation and long-term survival (29). IL-2 enhances T cell expansion, while IL-15 supports memory T cell formation (30). These cytokines enable effective CAR-T responses and better outcomes in hematologic cancers. In contrast, solid tumors have an immunosuppressive TME, dominated by cytokines like TGF-β, IL-10, and IL-4, which hinder CAR-T and CAR-NK function (31). TGF-β promotes regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, limiting immune responses (32). To overcome this, armored CAR-T and CAR-NK cells are engineered to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-12 or IL-18, counteracting TGF-β and IL-10, and enhancing immune activation (33). Combining checkpoint inhibitors, like anti-PD-1/PD-L1, further boosts CAR therapy efficacy in solid tumors.",
        "Efficient trafficking of CAR-T cells into solid tumors is impeded by physical barriers like the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and abnormal vasculature, as well as the absence of appropriate chemokine gradients (34). Recent strategies to improve CAR-T cell infiltration include engineering CAR-T cells with chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR2b, CXCR1) to enhance homing and penetration into tumors (35). Additionally, expressing matrix-degrading enzymes like heparanase facilitates the breakdown of ECM components, enabling deeper tumor penetration (36). Localized delivery of CAR-T cells directly to the tumor site can bypass systemic trafficking barriers, increasing efficacy while reducing toxicity (37). Similarly, the infiltration of CAR-NK cells into solid tumors is hindered by physical barriers like the dense ECM and abnormal vasculature. Engineering CAR-NK cells with chemokine receptors like CCR2 or CXCR1 to enhance tumor homing has been shown to improve trafficking (38). The use of matrix-degrading enzymes like heparanase also facilitates deeper penetration into tumors (39). Localized delivery of CAR-NK cells directly to the tumor site can help bypass systemic barriers, increasing the concentration at the target site and reducing toxicities.",
        "Many antigens expressed on solid tumors are also present at low levels on normal tissues, leading to potential off-target toxicity when CAR-T cells target these antigens (40). Recent studies have focused on enhancing the specificity of CAR-T cell therapy to minimize off-tumor toxicity. One approach involves the use of synthetic Notch (SynNotch) receptors, which require the simultaneous recognition of two antigens to activate CAR-T cell cytotoxicity, thus increasing specificity for tumor cells (41). Another strategy employs inhibitory CARs (iCARs), which are engineered with inhibitory receptors that detect antigens expressed on normal tissues, preventing CAR-T cells from attacking healthy cells (42). CAR-NK cells also face the challenge of off-target toxicity due to antigens expressed on both tumors and normal tissues. SynNotch receptors, which require the recognition of two antigens to activate CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity, enhance specificity for tumor cells (43). Inhibitory CARs (iCARs) have also been developed for CAR-NK cells, helping prevent them from attacking healthy tissues (44). Together, these strategies improve the safety and precision of CAR-NK cell therapy in treating solid tumors.",
        "CAR-T cells often face limited persistence and functional exhaustion within the hostile tumor microenvironment, diminishing their long-term efficacy against solid tumors (45). Recent advancements focus on enhancing CAR-T cell persistence and functionality. Engineering CAR-T cells to adopt a memory phenotype improves their longevity and anti-tumor activity (46). Additionally, metabolic reprogramming enhances CAR-T cell fitness, enabling them to thrive in nutrient-deprived and hypoxic conditions typical of solid tumors (47). Similar to CAR-T cells, CAR-NK cells can exhibit limited persistence and become exhausted within the tumor microenvironment. To address this, CAR-NK cells have been engineered to adopt a memory-like phenotype or to express cytokines like IL-15, improving their longevity and self-renewal capacity (48). Metabolic reprogramming ensures CAR-NK cells thrive in the harsh conditions of solid tumors (49). Optimizing co-stimulatory domains such as 2B4 or DAP12 and combining CAR-NK therapy with checkpoint inhibitors like PD-1 can help prevent exhaustion and sustain activity within the TME (50).",
        "Tumors can develop resistance to CAR-T cell therapy by downregulating or mutating the target antigen, leading to relapse (51). Strategies like sequential targeting, where CAR-T cells targeting different antigens are administered in succession, have been proposed to reduce the likelihood of antigen escape (52). Universal CAR platforms that allow for quick retargeting to new antigens as tumor evolution occurs enhance therapy adaptability (53). Multi-targeted approaches and real-time antigen monitoring further improve the durability and efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy in solid tumors (54). Similarly, antigen loss or mutation can lead to resistance to CAR-NK cell therapy. Sequential targeting of different antigens or using universal CAR platforms to quickly retarget to evolving antigens can help overcome antigen escape (55, 56). Multi-targeted approaches and real-time antigen monitoring also ensure the continuous effectiveness of CAR-NK cell therapy against heterogeneous tumors (57).",
        "The manufacturing and scalability of CAR-T and CAR-NK cell therapies remain significant barriers to their widespread adoption, particularly for solid tumor indications that require sophisticated engineering (58). Both therapies face challenges related to the complexity and cost of personalized production. For CAR-T cells, the process involves isolating and genetically modifying a patient’s T cells, which is time-consuming, costly, and requires specialized facilities. This personalized approach limits the scalability of CAR-T therapy, making it difficult to expand its use, particularly in resource-constrained settings (59). In contrast, CAR-NK cells offer potential advantages in scalability. Recent studies have focused on improving the accessibility of CAR-NK therapy through innovative manufacturing approaches (60). One promising development is the creation of off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells, which are derived from healthy donors or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (61). Unlike autologous CAR-NK cells, which require personalized production, off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells can be manufactured in bulk and stored for immediate use, significantly reducing production time and costs (62). This shift towards off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells enhances the efficiency and responsiveness of the therapy, making it more accessible and cost-effective compared to autologous CAR-T cell therapies. Furthermore, automated manufacturing platforms have been developed to improve scalability and consistency for both CAR-T and CAR-NK cells (63). These platforms utilize closed-system processes to minimize contamination risks, ensure high-quality products, and streamline workflows, making large-scale production more feasible. This is particularly important for CAR-NK cells, as the demand for off-the-shelf products could place considerable strain on production capabilities (64). By addressing the logistical and technical challenges of large-scale production, these innovations make both CAR-T and CAR-NK cell therapies more sustainable and accessible, particularly for treating solid tumors and other malignancies (65, 66).",
        "CAR-T therapy has proven highly effective in treating hematologic malignancies[304]; however, it is associated with significant safety concerns, particularly cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) (67). CRS occurs as a result of massive cytokine release from activated T cells, primarily interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which are critical in the pathophysiology of this adverse event (68). IL-6, in particular, plays a central role by driving fever, hypotension, and organ dysfunction (69), while IFN-γ can amplify the inflammatory response by inducing further cytokine release and immune cell activation (70). ICANS, which manifests as neurological toxicities such as encephalopathy, confusion, and seizures, is believed to be primarily triggered by the effects of cytokines on the blood-brain barrier and central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. To mitigate these risks, clinical management strategies have been developed. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, is commonly used to treat CRS by blocking the effects of IL-6, reducing the severity of the syndrome (71). Additionally, corticosteroids are often employed to manage severe cases of CRS and ICANS, by suppressing the inflammatory response and stabilizing the patient’s condition (72). In contrast, CAR-NK cell therapy, an emerging alternative to CAR-T, has demonstrated a reduced risk of both CRS and ICANS (73). This is largely attributed to the innate properties of NK cells, which have a transient persistence in the body and distinct cytokine profiles compared to T cells. NK cells generally produce lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, which significantly lowers the likelihood of CRS and neurotoxic effects (74). Furthermore, the shorter lifespan of NK cells in vivo means that they do not persist long enough to induce the prolonged cytokine-driven inflammation seen with CAR-T cells (75). As a result, CAR-NK therapy has been associated with fewer and less severe instances of both CRS and ICANS, offering a promising approach with a better safety profile in the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (76). The reduced risk of CRS/ICANS with CAR-NK therapy makes it an attractive option, particularly for patients who may be at high risk for these toxicities with CAR-T cells (77). Ongoing clinical trials continue to explore ways to optimize CAR-NK cell therapy and further reduce safety concerns, making it a compelling alternative to traditional CAR-T therapies.",
        "TCR- T cell therapy is an innovative form of adoptive cell therapy that leverages the specificity of TCRs to recognize and target tumor antigens presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules (78). Unlike CAR-T cells, which recognize antigens in an MHC-independent manner, TCR-T cells can target intracellular antigens, thereby expanding the range of potential targets. This section explores the primary strategies for TCR-T cell therapy, including targeting tumor antigens, viral antigens, the KRAS gene, and immune checkpoints. Each subsection discusses the challenges, recent advancements, and potential solutions, supported by relevant studies from the past decade.",
        "Targeting tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) and tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) is central to TCR-T cell therapy. TSAs are unique to cancer cells, while TAAs are overexpressed in tumors. Challenges include antigen selection, MHC restriction, tumor heterogeneity, and immune tolerance to certain antigens, which limit the therapy’s efficacy (79). Recent advancements focus on improving specificity and efficacy. High-affinity TCRs, such as those targeting NY-ESO-1, have shown enhanced anti-tumor activity (80). Neoantigen targeting, where TCRs target tumor-specific mutations, has also shown promise (81). Universal TCRs that recognize multiple HLA types are being developed to expand treatment eligibility. Innovative strategies include multi-antigen targeting to overcome tumor heterogeneity and immune escape, and universal TCR platforms using CRISPR/Cas9 to create broadly applicable TCR-T cells. Personalized TCR-T therapy, enabled by next-generation sequencing (NGS), allows customization for individual patients, improving precision and effectiveness (82). These strategies collectively enhance the potential of TCR-T cell therapy in targeting a wide range of tumors with improved specificity and reduced risk of immune escape.",
        "Targeting viral antigens with TCR-T cell therapy involves engineering TCR-T cells to recognize antigens from oncogenic viruses like Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Human Papillomavirus (HPV), and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), which are linked to various cancers (83). Challenges include ensuring consistent high-level expression of viral antigens on tumor cells, immune evasion by viruses that downregulate antigen presentation or inhibit T cell function, and potential off-target effects on normal cells with latent infections (84). Additionally, the limited number of suitable antigens for TCR targeting restricts the range of targets for therapy. To improve efficacy and safety, several strategies are being explored. These include enhancing antigen presentation by combining TCR-T cell therapy with agents that upregulate MHC expression or block viral immune evasion (85). The development of dual-specific TCRs, which recognize both viral and tumor antigens, can enhance specificity and reduce immune escape (86). Safety mechanisms like inducible suicide genes can control TCR-T cell elimination in cases of severe toxicity, thereby reducing harm to normal tissues (87). These approaches aim to improve the precision, safety, and therapeutic potential of TCR-T cell therapies targeting viral antigens (88).",
        "KRAS is a frequently mutated oncogene in cancers such as pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers (89). Targeting KRAS mutations with TCR-T cell therapy offers promise, but challenges include mutation specificity, HLA restriction, tumor heterogeneity, and avoiding off-target effects on normal tissues (90). Designing TCRs that differentiate mutant from wild-type KRAS peptides and ensuring TCR-T cells target only tumor cells without causing toxicity are key issues. Recent studies show progress in KRAS-targeted TCR-T therapies. For example, TCR-T cells targeting KRAS G12D in pancreatic cancer have demonstrated preclinical efficacy (91). High-affinity TCRs for the KRAS G12V mutation have also shown improved anti-tumor activity with fewer off-target effects (92). Combining KRAS-targeted TCR-T cells with MEK inhibitors has exhibited synergistic effects, addressing resistance mechanisms in KRAS-mutant tumors. Potential solutions to enhance KRAS-targeted TCR-T therapy include multi-antigen targeting to address tumor heterogeneity, universal TCR platforms for broader patient applicability, and advanced gene editing techniques like CRISPR/Cas9 to improve TCR specificity and reduce off-target effects. These strategies could significantly improve the precision, efficacy, and scalability of KRAS-targeted therapies (93).",
        "Targeting immune checkpoints in TCR-T cell therapy aims to enhance anti-tumor activity by modulating inhibitory pathways within the tumor microenvironment. Challenges include the need to target multiple checkpoints simultaneously, safety concerns such as autoimmunity, and tumor resistance through alternative inhibitory pathways (94). Persistent antigen exposure can also lead to T cell exhaustion, reducing therapeutic efficacy. Recent advancements focus on overcoming these challenges. Strategies include engineering TCR-T cells to secrete PD-1 blocking antibodies or express dominant-negative PD-1 receptors, thereby preventing exhaustion (95). Combining TCR-T therapy with CTLA-4 blockade or dual checkpoint blockade (e.g., PD-1 and TIM-3) has shown improved efficacy (96). Armored TCR-T cells expressing checkpoint inhibitors or pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-12 create a more favorable tumor environment (97). Potential solutions include engineering armored TCR-T cells, employing synthetic biology approaches to modulate checkpoint pathways, and utilizing combination therapies with other immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors or cytokine therapies. These strategies enhance anti-tumor responses and efficacy, making TCR-T cell therapies more robust and effective against immune-evasive tumors (98).",
        "These alternative immunotherapies—Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL), Natural Killer (NK), and Cytokine-Induced Killer (CIK) cell therapies—are promising strategies in the treatment of various malignancies (99). While TIL therapy harnesses tumor-specific T cells to directly target cancer, NK cell therapy benefits from the innate immune system’s ability to recognize and kill tumors without MHC restriction. CIK cell therapy combines the properties of both T cells and NK cells, showing broad potential in eliminating a variety of cancers (100). However, challenges such as enhancing cell persistence, overcoming immunosuppressive microenvironments, and optimizing treatment protocols remain areas for further research and development.",
        "Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) therapy is an adoptive cell therapy where T cells are isolated from a patient’s tumor, expanded ex vivo, and reinfused to attack cancer cells (101). TILs, especially CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), recognize tumor antigens on cancer cell surfaces. TIL therapy has shown promising results in melanoma, with durable responses in patients who did not respond to conventional therapies (102). The process involves extracting tumor tissue, isolating TILs, expanding them with agents like interleukin-2 (IL-2), and reinfusing them to enhance the immune response against cancer (103). While effective in melanoma, challenges persist in improving TIL persistence and efficacy in other solid tumors due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (104). Recent studies have explored gene-editing techniques to enhance TIL function, highlighting the potential and the need for further advancements to optimize TIL therapy’s clinical outcomes (105). Future directions include enhancing TIL survival, improving their infiltration into tumors, and combining TIL therapy with other immunomodulatory treatments to overcome resistance mechanisms (106).",
        "NK cells are innate immune cells capable of recognizing and killing cancer cells without prior sensitization (107). Unlike T cells, NK cells do not require antigen presentation via MHC molecules, enabling them to target a wider range of tumors, including those with low or absent MHC expression (108). NK cell therapy involves expanding and activating NK cells ex vivo, followed by reinfusion to target cancer cells (109). It has been explored for various cancers, including hematological malignancies (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma) and solid tumors (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer) (110).",
        "A key challenge in NK cell therapy is enhancing their persistence and function within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (111). Strategies to overcome this include genetic modification to enhance NK cell activity, cytokine support (e.g., IL-15), and combining NK cell therapy with other immune therapies like checkpoint inhibitors (112). Recent studies have shown progress in NK cell therapy. Rubio et al. demonstrated that NK cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting CD19 exhibited enhanced anti-tumor activity in B-cell malignancies (113). Additionally, Miller et al. reported promising results in NK cell therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), highlighting its growing potential in cancer immunotherapy (114). Future advancements focus on improving NK cell persistence, enhancing their cytotoxicity, and integrating NK cell therapies with other treatment modalities to maximize therapeutic efficacy (115).",
        "CIK cell therapy is an adoptive immunotherapy approach where T cells are expanded with cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-γ, to generate highly cytotoxic lymphocytes capable of targeting and killing tumor cells (116). CIK cells are a heterogeneous population, including T cells and NK-like cells, with potent anti-tumor effects (117). They can recognize and eliminate tumor cells without antigen-specific activation, showing promise in treating both hematologic and solid tumors, such as non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer (118). However, challenges remain in optimizing cell expansion, enhancing persistence, and overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (119). Recent studies highlight the potential of CIK therapy. CIK cells, combined with chemotherapy, improved survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients (120). Future research aims to enhance CIK cell proliferation, improve their trafficking to tumor sites, and integrate CIK therapy with other immunomodulatory treatments to enhance their anti-tumor efficacy.",
        "Despite significant progress, cell-based immunotherapies face numerous challenges. Manufacturing and scalability remain major obstacles, as personalized therapies like CAR-T and TCR-T cells are complex and costly to produce. This necessitates the development of universal cell platforms and automated manufacturing processes for broader scalability. The immunosuppressive TME poses another significant hurdle, requiring innovative strategies such as engineering cells to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, express dominant-negative receptors, and combine with checkpoint inhibitors to enhance their efficacy. Safety and toxicity issues, including managing on-target, off-tumor effects and severe toxicities like CRS and neurotoxicity, are crucial concerns that necessitate the incorporation of safety switches and improved target specificity. Additionally, resistance mechanisms present ongoing challenges, as tumors can develop resistance through antigen loss, upregulation of alternative checkpoints, and metabolic adaptations. This drives the exploration of multi-targeted and combination therapies to counteract these adaptive strategies. Addressing these multifaceted challenges is essential for the continued advancement and widespread adoption of cell-based immunotherapies in cancer treatment.",
        "The future of cell-based immunotherapy is highly promising, driven by ongoing research aimed at enhancing specificity and efficacy through advanced gene editing, multi-antigen targeting, and synthetic biology approaches. Efforts are also focused on expanding the applications of these therapies to encompass a broader range of solid tumors and other malignancies, thereby increasing their therapeutic impact across diverse cancer types. Improving accessibility is another critical objective, with the development of off-the-shelf products and strategies to reduce manufacturing costs making these advanced treatments more widely available to patients. Furthermore, the integration of personalized medicine, leveraging genomic and proteomic data, allows for the tailoring of therapies to individual patient profiles, thereby enhancing treatment outcomes and ensuring more precise and effective cancer management. These advancements collectively pave the way for more robust, versatile, and patient-centric cell-based immunotherapies in the fight against cancer.",
        "Cell-based immunotherapies, including CAR-T, CAR-NK, and TCR-T therapies, demonstrate immense potential in cancer treatment, particularly excelling in hematologic malignancies with significant clinical successes. These therapies enhance treatment efficacy by precisely targeting and eliminating tumor cells. However, their application in solid tumors faces several challenges, such as antigen heterogeneity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, limited cell infiltration, off-target toxicity, cell persistence, and manufacturing scalability. Despite ongoing challenges, the future of cell-based immunotherapies in cancer treatment remains promising. Continued research and innovation are crucial to overcoming issues related to safety, efficacy, and scalability, ultimately providing more precise and personalized treatment options for cancer patients. By addressing these challenges, cell-based immunotherapies can fulfill their potential in transforming cancer care and improving patient outcomes on a global scale.",

Preclinical studies indicate that human CD34(+) stem cells can stimulate new blood vessel formation in ischemic myocardium, improving perfusion and function. In ACT34-CMI (N = 167), patients treated with autologous CD34(+) stem cells had improvements in angina and exercise time at 6 and 12 months compared to placebo; however, the longer-term effects of this treatment are unknown. ACT34 was a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing placebo, low dose (1 x 10(5) CD34/kg body weight), and high dose (5 x 10(5) CD34/kg) using intramyocardial delivery into the ischemic zone following NOGA((R)) mapping. To obtain longer-term safety and efficacy in these patients, we compiled data of major adverse cardiac events (MACE; death, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, or heart failure hospitalization) up to 24 months as well as angina and quality of life assessments in patients who consented for 24-month follow-up. A total of 167 patients with class III-IV refractory angina were randomized and completed the injection procedure. The low-dose-treated patients had a significant reduction in angina frequency (p = 0.02, 0.035) and improvements in exercise tolerance testing (ETT) time (p = 0.014, 0.017) compared to the placebo group at 6 and 12 months. At 24 months, patients treated with both low-and high-dose CD34(+) cells had significant reduction in angina frequency (p = 0.03). At 24 months, there were a total of seven deaths (12.5%) in the control group versus one (1.8%) in the low-dose and two (3.6%) in the high-dose (p = 0.08) groups. At 2 years, MACE occurred at a rate of 33.9%, 21.8%, and 16.2% in control, low-, and high-dose patients, respectively (p = 0.08). Autologous CD34(+) cell therapy was associated with persistent improvement in angina at 2 years and a trend for reduction in mortality in no-option patients with refractory angina. May 4.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) therapy for cerebral infarction has been previously demonstrated. However, the lack of response in some patients has hindered its widespread use. To establish HSC therapy as a standard treatment, it is important to examine the causes of non-responsiveness. In this study, we aimed to identify the specifications of transplanted cells based on their therapeutic mechanisms to predict treatment success. We found that HSC therapy activates injured cerebral endothelial cells via gap junctions because cell adhesion between HSCs and the endothelium plays an essential role in cellular communication via gap junctions. The expression of the adhesion molecule integrin β2 (CD18) in CD34-positive (CD34 + ) cells was identified as critical for the therapeutic effect on cerebral infarction in a murine model. Cells with low CD18 expression exhibited a weaker therapeutic effect than cells with high CD18 expression, even when the same number of HSCs was administered. The expression of CD18 in CD34 + cells can be used as a specification marker for transplanted HSCs and is useful for identifying non-responders.

        "Stem cell therapy is a promising treatment for ischemic diseases, including stroke. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have shown a remarkable ability to promote angiogenesis in both nonclinical and clinical studies [1,2,3,4,5,6]. However, some patients do not respond to cell therapy, as both positive and neutral/negative results have been reported in double-blind placebo-controlled studies involving autologous HSC transplantation [6,7,8].",
        "We investigated the causes of this non-response. One reason for this is that microglia accumulate because of the mixing of degenerated cells with transplanted HSCs, inhibiting re-angiogenesis [9]. In contrast, non-responders have been reported in clinical studies on the transplantation of purified HSCs [10,11]. It was considered that there were other factors in addition to the mixing of degenerated cells. Although the number of CD34 positive (CD34+) cells is believed to influence the efficacy of HSC therapy, there is no consensus on the optimal number of CD34+ cells [12,13]. Some reports have shown that the therapeutic effect on the CD34 count is dose-dependent [14,15], whereas others have shown that a low dose is effective [16] or that there is no significant difference in cell numbers [17]. The number of transplanted cells was also insufficient to account for non-responders.",
        "In cell transplantation therapy, the “homing” ability of transplanted cells is important [18,19]. The effectiveness of the treatment is greatly influenced by whether the transplanted cells can reliably reach and act at the damaged site. Buil et al. focused on the mechanism by which leukocytes infiltrate damaged brain parenchyma during cell transplantation therapy for stroke [19]. One of the important factors in this mechanism is the adhesion factor integrin β2 (CD18). Integrins are heterodimers consisting of α- and β-chains bound in a 1:1 ratio. Among them, integrin β2 is specific to leukocytes and binds to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on vascular endothelial cells, promoting leukocyte migration across the endothelium, including extravasation [20,21,22]. Furthermore, integrin β2 is related to the mechanism of HSC transplantation therapy for stroke that we previously revealed [23]. We demonstrated that the mechanism of HSC treatment involves the donation of metabolites as energy sources to damaged vascular endothelial cells via gap junctions, thereby rescuing damaged cells in a mouse model of stroke. It has been suggested that integrin β2 molecules work together with gap junctions [24,25,26]. Supplemental Figure S1 shows a schematic representation of the therapeutic mechanisms underlying HSC transplantation. The clinical significance of integrin β2 is well recognized. A deficiency in integrin β2 leads to leukocyte adhesion deficiency, an immunodeficiency condition characterized by refractory dermatitis and gingivitis [27]. Furthermore, it has been associated with a wide range of inflammation-related diseases, including colitis [28], COVID pneumonia [29], and dry eye disease [30]. Additionally, verification of CD18 expression in HSCs as a marker of therapeutic efficacy is of great clinical significance. To date, biomarker verification for responders to HSC therapy has mainly been conducted on the recipient side [31,32], and no studies have explored these markers in transplanted cells. Stem cell biomarkers other than human stem cells (HSCs) have been occasionally investigated [33,34]. If CD18 on HSCs is shown to be a marker that indicates the effectiveness of transplanted cells in HSC therapy, it will lead to the verification of optimal cell adjustment methods and prediction of therapeutic efficacy, leading to the widespread use of HSC therapy.",
        "In this study, we focused on the expression of CD18 in transplanted cells and verified whether its levels affected stroke efficacy. This study aimed to develop a specific marker for selecting therapeutically effective HSCs. In the present study, umbilical cord blood (UCB) was used as a source of HSCs, and the expression of CD18 in CD34+ cells from each UCB sample was examined. Additionally, the relationship between the expression level of CD18 and its therapeutic effects was elucidated in a mouse model of stroke.",
        "UCB was collected from babies delivered normally at full term after obtaining informed consent from all mothers. All experiments were performed with the approval of the Ethics Committees of the Japanese Red Cross Society and Foundation for Biomedical Research and Innovation at Kobe. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Foundation for Biomedical Research and Innovation in Kobe, Japan.",
        "Whole UCB was then overlaid on Ficoll-Paque™ (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) at a volume ratio of 2:1 and centrifuged at 400× g for 30 min at 18–20 °C. After density gradient centrifugation, cells in the buffy coat were collected and washed twice (400× g for 5 min) with divalent-cation-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For cryopreservation, the precipitates were suspended in Bambanker (Nippon genetics, Tokyo, Japan) at 2 × 106/mL, frozen at −80 °C, and stored in liquid nitrogen. When used, the frozen samples were rapidly thawed in a 37 °C water bath. All UCB-derived mononuclear cells (UCB-MNCs) used in this study were freeze-thawed cells.",
        "For accurate cell identification and quantification, multiple UCB-MNC samples were examined simultaneously by flow cytometry. The cells were stained with BV421-conjugated anti-CD34 antibody (568758, BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody (555482, BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), 7AAD (559925, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and R718-conjugated anti-CD18 antibody (752264, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) Lyric (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). HSCs were identified as CD34 positive, CD45 weakly positive, and 7AAD negative, whereas white blood cells (WBCs) were characterized as CD45 positive and 7AAD negative. The CD34+ cell rate was defined as the number of HSCs in WBCs. R718-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 (566928, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was used as an isotype control, and CD18 expression values were indicated as the ratio of the median to the isotype control (Table 1, Panel 1, Supplemental Figure S2).",
        "To verify the activation of vascular endothelial cells by HSCs in vitro, we performed a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) uptake experiment in a co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and HSCs. HUVECs (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) were cultured according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and passage six HUVECs were used in this study. The uptake of recombinant human VEGF (rhVEGF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was assessed using a previously described method [23,35]. In brief, biotin-conjugated rhVEGF was incubated with streptavidin-conjugated APC (Becton Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at a molecular ratio of 4:1 for 10 min at room temperature. The CD34 positivity rate in UCB-MNCs was measured in advance, and CD34+ cells in UCB-MNCs and the same number of HUVECs were co-cultured at 37 °C for 2 h with APC-labeled rhVEGF (at a final concentration of 10 nM). After co-culture, the cells were stained with PE-conjugated CD31 antibody (555446, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), FITC-conjugated anti-human CD45 antibody (555482, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and 7-AAD (559925, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The median APC fluorescence in CD31-positive, CD45-negative, and 7AAD-negative HUVECs was assessed using FACS, according to the same protocol [23,36].",
        "A stroke model with excellent reproducibility was used in 5-week-old male SCID mice (CB-17/lcr-scid/scidJcl; Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan), as described previously [36,37]. Briefly, permanent focal cerebral ischemia was induced by permanent ligation and disconnection of the distal portion of the left middle cerebral artery using bipolar forceps under isoflurane inhalation anesthesia (3% for induction and 2% for maintenance). All prepared mice underwent successful surgery.",
        "The CD34 positivity rate and CD18 expression levels were measured in advance by flow cytometry. Different sample populations were used for in vivo immunohistochemical analysis, rotarod tests, and in vitro VEGF uptake assays because the number of cells was not sufficient to perform multiple tests. For in vivo immunohistochemical analysis, CD34+ cells that showed about 11 or 31 fluorescence intensity ratios of CD18 were used as low or high CD18 cells, respectively. UCB-MNCs suspended in Bambanker were injected intravenously (i.v.) 48 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) insult using 31G needles. The number of MNCs administered was 1 × 105 for immunohistochemical analysis and 0.4 × 105 for the rotarod test.",
        "For immunohistochemical analysis, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with saline, followed by 2% paraformaldehyde. To analyze the cortex histochemically, coronal sections (20 µM) were prepared using a vibratome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) by the same protocol previously [23]. The sections were immunofluorescently stained with primary antibodies against CD31 (dilution 1:50; 550274; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and ICAM-1 (dilution 1:1000; 10020-1-AP Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA). Alexa Fluor 488- and 555-coupled antibodies (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used as secondary antibodies to visualize ICAM-1 and CD31, respectively. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (dilution 1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Microscopic investigations were performed using an LSM980 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To measure the number of blood vessels, CD31 was visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB, D5637, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin solution (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Osaka, Japan). Microscopic examination was performed using a BZ-X800 microscope (KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan). Three coronal sections were selected for blood vessel counting: one at the bregma and the other two 320 µM anterior and posterior to the bregma. Parallel lines were drawn on a coronal section at positions 250, 500, 750, and 1000 µM from the top. In the peri-infarct area, the number of blood vessels with a diameter of 4 µM or more that crossed these lines and were located within 100 µM on both sides of the ischemic boundary was calculated. In the infarct core, the number of blood vessels located within 500–700 µM of the ischemic boundary was calculated (Supplemental Figure S3).",
        "Sensorimotor skills were evaluated using the rotarod test. One week after cell treatment, the rotarod drum was accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm for 5 min (Muromachi Kikai Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan). After five weeks of cell therapy, the rotarod drum was run at a uniform speed of 30 rpm without acceleration. Each mouse was then placed on a stationary drum. The rotor was then switched on after five seconds. The time required for the mouse to fall off the rotating drum was recorded. This trial was repeated five times at 1 min intervals. The average time from five falls off the drum was used for statistical analysis.",
        "To quantify the CD18 expression level in CD34+ cells, the QuantiBRITE system (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was used [38]. A phycoerythrin-labeled CD18 antibody suitable for antigen quantification with a fluorescein/protein ratio of 1:1, prepared using mouse anti-human CD18 (clone: L130), was obtained from BD Biosciences. Thawed UCB-MNCs were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody (555482, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), 7AAD (559925, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), APC-conjugated anti-CD34 antibody (555824, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and custom-made PE-conjugated anti-CD18 antibody (Table 1, Panel 2), and washed with PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum. The samples were analyzed using FACSLyric. BD Quantibrite PE beads (340495, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were measured using the equipment settings configured earlier, and a calibration curve was created. The CD18 expression level was defined as the number of PE molecules, that is, the number of bound antibodies, from the calibration curve. Three measurements were performed on five samples to investigate the daily variation. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated from the results of the three measurements.",
        "Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The number of blood vessels and results of the rotarod test were assessed using one-way analysis of variance with Dunn’s test. The results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The correlation between the number of CD34+ cells and CD18 expression was analyzed by linear regression analysis.",
        "In a previous study, we observed a significant increase in VEGF uptake by HUVECs co-cultured with MNCs, including CD34+ cells [23]. This increase indicated the potential effect of co-cultured HSCs on the promotion of vascular endothelial proliferation. VEGF uptake into HUVECs depended on the number of CD34+ cells in the co-cultured MNCs; no VEGF uptake was observed in HUVECs co-cultured with CD34+ cell-depleted MNC [35]. In the present study, we used this assay to co-culture HUVECs with 27 individual UCB-MNC samples to examine the effects of differences in CD18 expression in CD34+ cells on the uptake ability of HUVECs. There was a significant positive correlation between VEGF uptake into HUVECs and CD18 expression levels in the 27 co-cultures examined (Figure 1A). This suggests that CD18 expression in CD34+ cells might be a key factor in promoting vascular endothelial proliferation of CD34+ cells.",
        "Next, the effect of CD18 expression was examined in the MCAO mouse model. UCB-MNCs containing CD34+ cells were i.v. injected (1 × 105 cells in 100 µL PBS/mouse) into the MCAO mouse model 48 h after the insult. The number of cerebral microvessels in the infarct area (infarct core and peri-infarct area) was calculated 24 h after cell treatment. In mice transplanted with high-CD18 cells, the number of cerebral microvessels in the peri-infarct area was significantly higher than that in the PBS or low-CD18 groups. Although no significant differences were observed in the infarct core area, the high-CD18 group tended to have more microvessels than the control and low-CD18 groups (Figure 1B,C). Similar to the in vitro results shown in Figure 1A, these findings support the idea that CD18 expression in transplanted CD34+ cells affects the therapeutic efficacy.",
        "Using the MCAO mouse brain, immunostaining was performed 48 h after the MCAO insult, which is the optimal time for transplantation of HSCs. The expression of ICAM-1, a ligand for CD18, increased in cerebral vascular endothelial cells in the infarct area (Figure 2). This result also supports the idea that there is a high possibility that CD18 expression in CD34+ cells is related to the therapeutic effect of HSCs.",
        "CD18 expression in CD34+ cells varied significantly among UCB-MNC samples. There was no correlation between the proportion of CD34+ cells in UCBs and the expression level of CD18 in CD34+ cells in UCB-MNCs (Figure 3A). Thus, MNCs with high CD34+ cell content do not necessarily express high levels of CD18. This finding indicates that the number of HSCs alone may not be a reliable predictor of therapeutic effects.",
        "CD34+ cells with low or high CD18 expression (Figure 3A) were administered to MCAO model mice, and the therapeutic effects of these two samples were compared. To accurately verify the effect of CD18 expression, samples with the same CD34 positivity rate but differing CD18 expression levels were selected, ensuring that the number of HSCs in the transplanted cells was approximately the same. Each sample contained 0.4 × 105 MNCs in 100 µL of PBS and was i.v. injected. The low CD18 expression sample contained 419 CD34+ cells, and the high CD18 expression sample contained 456 CD34+ cells. There was a 2.9-fold difference in CD18 expression in CD34+ cells between the two samples (see the comparison of the median values in Supplemental Figure S4). The therapeutic effect was evaluated using the rotarod test at 1 and 5 weeks after cell treatment (Figure 3B). In the group treated with low CD18 expression, some mice showed no improvement, particularly after 5 weeks. In contrast, all mice in the group treated with high CD18 expression showed significant improvement. This result indicated that the therapeutic efficacy of CD34+ cells also depends in CD18 expression rather than the cell number alone.",
        "CD18 expression levels in CD34+ cells from five UCB-MNC samples were measured using the QuantiBRITE system. Approximately 500 CD34+ cells per sample were analyzed. The %CV was calculated from the three assays to verify the variability between assays. As a result, the %CV ranged from 0.38 to 3.97, with an average of 2.35, indicating that measurements were possible with little variation (Table 2).",
        "In this study, we focused on an adhesion molecule expressed in CD34+ cells and examined whether the expression level of integrin β2 (CD18) is associated with the efficacy of cell transplantation therapy for cerebral infarction. We found that CD18 expression in CD34+ cells was related to its therapeutic effect both in vitro and in vivo. A schematic diagram of the mechanism is shown in Figure 4. Our results show that when performing cell therapy using HSCs, it is important to pay attention not only to the number of CD34+ cells but also to the expression levels of adhesion factors, especially integrin β2.",
        "To date, no markers have been identified to evaluate the function of HSCs because the therapeutic mechanism of HSCs is unclear. Therefore, the number of CD34+ cells, which plays a major role after transplantation, has been the focus of HSC treatment. However, we have recently elucidated the therapeutic mechanisms of HSCs [23]. HSCs are in a glycolytically dominant metabolic state [39,40], and cell-cell interactions with vascular endothelial cells in the infarct area and metabolite donation via gap junctions play key roles in HSC treatment (Supplemental Figure S1). To clarify the treatment mechanism of HSCs, the present study focused on adhesion factors that are important for the initial contact between HSCs and vascular endothelial cells. This study demonstrated the significant role of CD18 expression in CD34+ cells, explaining why the number of transplanted CD34+ cells does not directly correlate with the strength of its effect [12,13]. These findings provide a novel marker for quantifying the potential of transplanted HSCs, which should be evaluated for significance in future clinical trials.",
        "Interactions between integrins and connexins, which are gap junction components, have been reported in various cell types including leukocytes [24,25,26]. Integrin activation controls the expression of connexins and communication through gap junctions [24]. Since gap junctions play an important role in the treatment mechanism, the expression of integrin β2, which cooperates with gap junctions, is an important factor in treatment. Integrins are also involved in homing. Homing is induced by chemokines and involves multiple stages, including migration, rolling, and adhesion [19]. In this study, we focused on integrins that interact with gap junctions. However, it may be worthwhile to examine other factors.",
        "At the optimal time for HSC treatment in MCAO model mice (subacute phase: 48 h after the insult), ICAM-1, a ligand for integrin β2, was highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells in the peri-infarct area (Figure 2). Therefore, the transplanted cells showed cell-cell interactions with damaged vascular endothelial cells expressing ICAM-1 during the pre-infarct period, resulting in a remarkable therapeutic effect. Previous studies have reported that ICAM-I expression in the microvasculature is increased in autopsied human brains after stroke, particularly in infarcted hemispheres [41]. These findings support the importance of CD18 expression in transplanted HSCs for clinical treatment.",
        "Laskowiz et al. showed that allogeneic UCB-MNCs improved functional outcomes in ischemic stroke patients in (phase I trial) [8]. However, they did not show any benefits in a phase II trial [42]. The use of allogeneic cells makes it possible to select cells for transplantation in advance. If the transplanted cells had been selected based on their involvement in the therapeutic mechanism, outcome improvement might have been achieved in a phase II trial. This lack of response may be attributable to the low expression of CD18 in the transplanted HSCs. HSCs are remarkably effective in the treatment of various ischemic diseases, and numerous clinical trials on HSCs are ongoing worldwide. Cell selection based on therapeutic mechanisms may increase the reliability of the therapeutic effects of HSCs.",
        "This study demonstrated the importance of CD18 in the treatment of cerebral infarction. The fundamental therapeutic mechanism begins with the adhesion of HSCs to damaged blood vessels expressing ICAM-1. It has been suggested that a similar mechanism occurs in the treatment of various diseases in which blood vessels express ICAM-1. It has been reported that ICAM-1 is expressed in the blood vessels of mouse ischemic limbs [43] and in the postmortem hearts of patients with myocardial infarction [44]. Furthermore, it has been reported that in the treatment of myocardial infarction, the therapeutic effect is improved when CD18 is overexpressed in transplanted adipose-derived stem cells [45], indicating that CD18 on transplanted cells is also important in the treatment of myocardial infarction. From the above, it is strongly suggested that the findings of this study can be applied to cell therapy for various diseases.",
        "The expression level of CD18 in CD34+ cells was considered a specification marker for the transplanted cells. Flow cytometry is one of the simplest and most useful methods for cell evaluation. However, a major drawback of this method is that it can only be evaluated as a relative value in each experiment. Therefore, it cannot be determined using the expression value alone. The QuantiBRITE system can quantitatively measure the amount of antigen as an absolute value with high reproducibility. It has already been used in clinical settings [46,47] and was used in this study as well. However, although the QuantiBRITE system is a highly accurate measurement method with little variability in measurements, there are differences in variability depending on the marker type [38]. In this study, we quantified a small number of frozen cells, and the average %CV value was found to be approximately 2.8%. In the future, to use it as a specification marker in clinical settings, it will be necessary to increase the number of samples and verify the variation between assays, measurers, and facilities. In addition, the differences between the instruments can be eliminated using controls; therefore, this should be used as a reference [48]. This study suggests that the expression of CD18 in CD34+ cells can be quantified and adequately measured in clinical settings. Furthermore, by accumulating measurement data from actual transplanted CD34+ cells, we aimed to verify the relationship between treatment effects and measurements to establish a specification marker.",
        "This study has the following limitations: (1) The reason why the levels of CD18 in CD34+ cells are significantly varied between samples remains unsolved. While standardized procedures were used for cord blood collection, elusive differences in cord blood—such as subclinical infection during pregnancy, irritation of the coagulation cascade, or genetic polymorphisms—might affect the level of CD18 expression in CD34+ cells. Notably, anticoagulant factor levels have been reported to be associated with CD18 levels [49]. (2) Further investigation is needed to identify new markers other than CD18, such as adhesion factors and chemokines.

        "The present study demonstrates the importance of integrin β2 in HSC efficacy in an MCAO mouse model. This suggests that CD18 expression in HSCs is an important factor in the therapeutic efficacy of HSC transplantation therapy and can be used to distinguish non-responders. Furthermore, this finding might be applicable not only to cerebral infarction but also to various other ischemic diseases.",
