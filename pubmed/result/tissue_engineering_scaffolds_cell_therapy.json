        "Patients with clinical situations, such as skull defect, chronic non-unions of fracture, or spinal fusion may require repeated autologous bone grafts. The disadvantages of using autologous bone grafts include limited availability, donor-site morbidity, and reduced osteogenicity. Wright et al. have repaired long-bone and cranial defects by utilizing muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) transfected with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) [1–3]. However, this approach has its limitation because MDSCs normally generate inappropriate overgrowth of bone tissue in situ. Although Hannallah et al. reported that the inappropriate overgrowth can be prevented by multiple gene therapies, such as the combination of BMP4 and Noggin (BMP4 antagonist), the transfected cells must be tightly regulated which make the procedure difficult to manage [4, 5]. Besides, the stem cell-based gene therapy is lengthy considering the time required for stem cell isolation, in vitro transfection, and implantation of cells until ossification in the defect is observed [6–8].",
        "It is known that ectopic bone tissues in the skeletal muscle can be induced by injecting adeno-associated viruses (AAV) containing the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) gene [9, 10]. However, it remains uncertain whether the bone tissue generated by the AAV-BMP4 induction can be used as a bone graft. Therefore, in the present study, a new strategy was used to overcome the disadvantages of stem cell-based gene therapy for the skull defect repair. In this strategy, ectopic bone formation in the skeletal was accomplished by the implantation of AAV-BMP4 during the first stage, and then the bone tissues were harvested and tested for its grafting capacity for skull defect repair during the second stage. Results generated from the present study provide us with a better understanding about ectopically formed bone tissues triggered by AAV-BMP4 in the skeletal muscle, which may be a new strategy for treating clinical patients with a need for bone grafts.",
        "Human BMP4 gene was carried by self-complementary AAV vectors [11]. The viral vector stocks of serotypes 6 of AAV-D(+)-BMP-4 were produced and purified according to published protocols [11], and vector titers were approximately 5 × 1012 viral particles per ml (vp/ml).",
        "The animal protocol using severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice in the present study was approved by the Experimental Animal Review Board of Zhengzhou University. Twelve pieces of Gelfoam (Pfizer, Kalamazoo, Michigan, 3 × 3 mm2) soaked with 15 μl AAV-BMP4 (5 × 1012 vp/ml) were implanted into both legs of six SCID mice. These mice were assessed by micro-CT at weeks 2, 12, and 24 after implantation surgery (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1Two-stage therapeutic utility of ectopically formed bone tissue induced by AAV-BMP4 in skeletal muscle. a Experimental design of two-stage therapeutic utility of ectopically formed bone tissue induced by AAV-BMP4 in skeletal muscle. b–d H&E staining of sample sections showing that the process of endochondral bone formation was triggered by the AAV-BMP4 with Gelfoam implantation in the muscle pocket.

        "The mice with AAV-BMP4 implantation surgery were sacrificed and ectopically generated bone tissue in the skeletal muscle pocket was harvested at week 12. At the same time, another set of twelve host mice with skull defects were surgically created [5]. Six of the 12 mice are the recipients of these freshly harvested bone grafts and were used as the experimental group, and the other 6 mice have no treatment and were used as the control group. Harvested bone tissue was shaped and resized to fit a 6-mm-diameter skull defect and then transplanted into six host mice (Fig. 1a). The incision was sutured closed, and mice were housed as normal.",
        "After AAV-BMP4 implantation, mice were checked by micro-computed tomography (μCT) at weeks 2, 12, and 24 after surgery. The mice with skull defects were also checked by μCT at weeks 4, 12, and 24 after bone graft transplantation surgery.",
        "Frozen sections were fixed in 10 % formalin for 10 min and were rinsed in distilled water three times. The slides were stained in 2 % silver nitrate solution in the dark for 15 min, rinsed three times in distilled water, and exposed to light for 15–30 min until appropriate stain development. These sections were counterstained with eosin according to the protocol [12].",
        "Implantation of Gelfoam containing 15 μl of AAV-BMP4 (5 × 1012 vp/ml) in the muscle pocket induced a large amount of ectopic bone tissue histologically (Fig. 1d) and was confirmed by μCT at 2 weeks post implantation (Fig. 1e).",
        "Implantation of AAV-BMP4 with Gelfoam yielded a large amount of bone tissue in the skeletal muscle by both histologically and μCT measurement. The process of bone formation is through endochondral bone formation. Normal histological structure of skeletal muscle is observed prior to AAV-BMP4 with Gelfoam implantation (Fig. 1b). Noticeable cartilage tissue is observed in the tissue section at week 2 after AAV-BMP4 with Gelfoam implantation (Fig. 1c), and bone tissue has formed by week 4 (Fig. 1d). μCT assessment demonstrated ectopic bone tissue formation at weeks 2, 12, and 24 after implantation. The bone density increased with time (Fig. 1e–g).",
        "The transplanted bone tissues successfully repaired the skull defect by μCT examinations at various time points after surgery. The bone graft gradually modified its dimension with time (Fig. 2a). There is no overgrowth of transplanted bone tissues at the site of the skull defect (Fig. 2b). Under μ-CT and histological examinations, the bony edge of the graft fused with the host bony skull defect effectively in time (Fig. 2c, d).Fig. 2Ectopic bone tissues repaired skull defect successfully. a μCT assessment showed harvested ectopic bone tissues repaired skull bone defect effectively with time.

        "Skeletal muscle is reported as the easiest infected organ for AAV when compared to other organs in several in vivo studies [11, 13]. In the present study AAV-BMP4 works very effectively to transform a large amount of skeletal muscles into similar amount of bone tissues in vivo. The histological observations also proved that the process underwent the endochondral bone formation.",
        "Ideally, the new bone regeneration strategy should be simple, cost effective, and as minimally invasive as possible to lessen donor-site morbidity [13–15]. In the present study, the thought of two-stage bone grafting was tested (Fig. 2a). The results demonstrated that ectopic bone tissue has good efficiency and practicality for bone grafting. As thought, the method was superior for the following reasons when compared to the traditional stem cell-based gene therapy. This method omitted a huge amount of in vitro work which included the isolation of stem cells, culturing, passage, virus transduction, and final implantation [16–18]. The bone tissues generated in the muscle pocket are easily harvested and applied in the skull defect. Our results also demonstrated that harvested bone tissues repaired the skull defect without the overgrowth of bone tissues, which is a major side complication of conventional stem cell-based BMP4 gene therapy [5].",
        "The concept of the present study was to help clinicians deal with patients with fracture non-union, bone defects, and spinal fusion. This method will enable one or several “unnecessary” pieces of skeletal muscle of patients to be transformed into the bone tissues needed for bone grafting in vivo. By saying the “unnecessary”, it means that transforming the piece of skeletal muscle into bone tissue does not affect normal body function severely. The transformed pieces of skeletal muscles could be the least used muscles or some muscles which did not affect the normal human body function after being removed, such as human palmaris longus muscle and plantaris muscle.",
        "As we know, there are around 650 skeletal muscles in the human body and they make up around half of the total human body weight. Skeletal muscle might become a potential bony autograft bank for patients with a need for bone grafting if the concept of the present study succeeds in future human clinical trial. Future work will investigate how to control the size and orientation of ectopic bone tissue in vivo in its first stage, as well as its efficiency for the treatment of long-bone defects instead of skull defect.",

    "title": "Tissue Engineering and Cell Therapy for Cartilage Repair: Preclinical Evaluation Methods. be an economic burden due to the cost of immediate treatment and loss in work productivity. If left untreated, such an injury may progress to osteoarthritis, a degenerative and debilitating joint disease characterized by pain and functional impairment. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which have immune-modulatory properties and the ability to differentiate into chondroblasts and osteoblasts, are a predictable source for the treatment of cartilage injuries. This article presents tools to evaluate cartilage restoration by tissue engineering and cell therapy treatment in a translational and preclinical large animal model. In this controlled experimental study with 14 miniature pigs, a scaffold-free tissue engineering construct (TEC) derived from dental pulp and synovial MSCs for cartilage therapy was tested. Total thickness cartilage defects were performed in both posterior knees. The defect was left empty in one of the knees, and the other received the TEC. The tissue repair was morphologically assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the three-dimensional double echo steady-state (3D-DESS) sequence, and compositional assessment was carried out based on the T2 mapping technique. The osteochondral specimens were fixed for histopathology, decalcified, subjected to standard histological processing, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sections stained for immunohistochemical detection of collagen types were digested with pepsin and chondroitinase and incubated with antibodies against them. The mechanical evaluation involved analysis of Young's modulus of the cartilage samples based on the indentation and maximum compression test. In addition, a finite element model was used to simulate and characterize properties of the osteochondral block. At 6 months after surgery, there were no complications with the animals and the MRI, histological, immunohistochemical, and biomechanical evaluations proved to be effective and qualified to differentiate good quality chondral repair from inadequate repair tissue. The proposed methods were feasible and capable to properly evaluate the defect filled with TEC containing stromal cells after 6 months of follow-up in a large animal model for articular cartilage restoration. Impact Statement Articular chondral injuries are prevalent and represent an economic burden due to the cost of treatment. The engineering of cartilage tissue can promote the repair of chondral injuries and is dependent on selecting appropriate cells and biocompatible frameworks. In this article, methods for evaluation of a scaffold-free cell delivery system made from mesenchymal stromal cells were present in a translational study that allows further clinical safety and efficacy trials. das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Cartilage injuries and osteoarthritis are prevalent public health problems, due to their disabling nature and economic impact. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from different tissues have the immunomodulatory capacity to regulate local joint environment. This translational study aims to compare cartilage restoration from MSCs from the synovial membrane (SM) and dental pulp (DP) by a tissue-engineered construct with Good Manufacturing Practices. Methods: A controlled experimental study was conducted on fourteen miniature pigs, using scaffold-free Tissue Engineering Constructs (TECs) from DP and SM MSCs, with a 6-month follow-up. Total thickness cartilage defects were created in both hind knees; one side was left untreated and the other received a TEC from either DP (n = 7) or SM (n = 7). An MRI assessed the morphology using the MOCART scoring system, T2 mapping evaluated water, and collagen fiber composition, and histological analysis was performed using the ICRS-2 score. Results: The untreated group had a mean MOCART value of 46.2 ± 13.4, while the SM-treated group was 65.7 ± 15.5 ( p < 0.05) and the DP-treated group was 59.0 ± 7.9 (n.s.). The T2 mapping indicated a mean value of T2 of 54.9 ± 1.9 for native cartilage, with the untreated group at 50.9 ± 2.4 ( p < 0.05). No difference was found between the T2 value of native cartilage and the treated groups.

        "Cartilage injuries and osteoarthritis are prevalent issues that pose significant public health challenges, leading to considerable disability and economic burdens on healthcare systems, particularly as the elderly population grows [1]. Cartilage defects can cause several complications for the individual, such as changes in the biomechanics and homeostasis of the joint, damage to the adjacent subchondral bone, decreased mobility, degeneration, and knee osteoarthritis directly affecting the quality of life. Thus, the study of new therapies for cartilage lesions is of high clinical relevance [2,3].",
        "In recent decades, tissue engineering has emerged as a multidisciplinary field, and central to this approach is the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which have gained significant attention due to their ease of collection, capacity for cell proliferation and differentiation, and immunomodulatory properties that help regulate the local environment of the articular joint. These cells can be isolated from various tissues, including adipose tissue, bone marrow, synovial membrane, and dental pulp [4,5]. However, dental pulp stromal cells (DPSCs) and synovial membrane stromal cells (SMSCs) are alternatives that can be obtained from procedures the patient would already undergo, such as routine arthroscopy for SMSCs or from less invasive procedures which can be performed by a dentist for DPSCs.",
        "Bueno et al., 2018 [6] showed that DPSCs can differentiate into chondroblasts, making them promising candidates for treating cartilage injuries, and demonstrate greater proliferative and immunomodulatory capacity in comparison to bone marrow MSCs [6]. Fernandes et al., 2018 [7] demonstrated that SMSCs exhibit high chondrogenic potential and can be harvested with minimal complications [7,8].",
        "Furthermore, when it comes to local cell delivery, a scaffold-free technology known as a tissue engineering construct (TEC) has been considered as a potential delivery system [5]. Therefore, the hypothesis of the study is that treatment with a TEC offers superior outcomes compared to the conventional method of preparing cartilage defects and disrupting the calcified cartilage layer.",
        "This translational study with medium-sized pigs aims to compare cartilage restoration using MSCs derived from both the synovial membrane (SM) and dental pulp (DP), by tissue engineered treatment using the Good Manufacturing Practices techniques [9].",
        "Nowadays, there is a gap of current therapies or active pharmaceutical ingredients for osteoarthritis treatment. Tissue engineering can promote the repair of chondral injuries and is dependent on selecting appropriate cells. In this article, histological and image evaluation were applied to compare the cartilage restoration by tissue engineering and cell therapy from mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the synovial membrane and dental pulp. Mesenchymal stromal cells can be collected through outpatient procedures performed by dentists, or through standard surgical procedures that are already part of the patient’s routine care. The impact of this study is to determine the optimal harvesting method for obtaining these stromal cells to advance tissue engineering for cartilage repair in humans.",

Wilmington, MA, USA), at the PISA Project (Faculdade de Medicina USP, São Paulo, Brazil). Images were acquired from both knees of the 14 pigs using two distinct sequences [14,15].",
        "The first sequence performed was the 3D double echo steady state (3D-DESS) for morphological evaluation. The parameters applied were the following: repetition time (TR) = 12.2 ms, echo time (TE) = 4.1 ms, fractional anisotropy (FA) = 25º, voxel = 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm3, field-of-view (FoV) = 192 × 256 mm, slice thickness 0.4 mm, acquisition time 10:52 min) [14,15].",
        "For these acquired images, sagittal and coronal views were used and articular cartilage repair tissue was evaluated using Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) 3D score. The score uses 11 categories to classify cartilage repair, ranging from 0 (no repair) to 100 points (complete repair of the cartilage defect).",
        "The second sequence was the spin-echo with multi-echo to evaluate the water and collagen fiber composition of the cartilage based on T2 mapping creation using ImageJ software version 1.53 (National Institutes of Health). The parameters were the following: TR = 10,000 ms, 18 echoes, TE = 9/18/27/336/45/54/63/72/81/90/99/108/117/126/135/144/153/162; voxel = 0.6 × 0.6 × 2.0 mm3, FoV 93 × 229 mm, slice thickness 2.0 mm, acquisition time 18:44 min) [16,17].",
        "For these acquired images, three consecutive sagittal sections were selected from each knee. In each section, one area of interest was selected representing the cartilage defect untreated and treated with the implantation of the TEC, and another was selected representing the intact chondral tissue (adjacent cartilage). After selecting the areas, the average T2 value was measured in each section of each knee, considering the native cartilage, groups treated with MSCs from SM and DP, and untreated groups [16,17].",
        "Another assessment was carried out using the mean T2 value measurement of the deep and superficial areas of the previously selected areas of interest [17].",
        "After MRI evaluation, both knees were dissected and subjected to histological evaluation in order to analyze the quality of the cartilage repair. A block around the defect measuring approximately 1.5 × 1.5 × 1.5 cm was cut and the tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and decalcified with ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA). The sections were prepared with a thickness of 4 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Two sections from each animal were stained with toluidine blue to evaluate the color concentration of the extracellular matrix [18].",
        "The ICRS-2 scoring system (Table 1) was used to assess the articular cartilage repair tissue and assigned a score for each of the 14 categories evaluated in the system, from 0 (worst result) to 100 points (best result). This evaluation was performed on the defect-only, SM treatment and DP treatment groups.",
        "Quantitative variables with normal distribution were described by measures of central tendency and dispersion (mean and standard deviation).",
        "ANOVA analyses followed by post hoc Bonferroni were used to compare the values obtained from the MOCART 3D system score and the ICRS-2 score. This test was used as the knees compared were from the same pigs and were subjected to the same external stimuli.",
        "ANOVA analyses were also used to compare the mean T2 values of the areas of interest, chondral defect and adjacent cartilage, and the T2 values from the deep and superficial regions in each area.",
        "The correlation between the different scoring systems (MOCART and ICRS-2) was measured with the Pearson correlation coefficient. The Software Sigmaplot version 15.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) was used in the calculations. The level of statistical significance adopted was equal to 5%; that is, the test results were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.",
        "The cell characterization by flow cytometry and in vitro induction confirmed the multipotentiality of cells derived from the SM and DP, since they differentiated into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic strains. In addition, MSCs showed positive reactions for mesenchymal markers (CD29, CD44, CD73, CD105, CD90, and CD166) and negative reactions to hematopoietic (CD34 and CD45) and endothelial markers (CD31) (Figure 4 and Table 2).",
        "A macroscopic evaluation was conducted to visually assess the repair quality of the cartilage defect, focusing on surface appearance, tissue integration, and color match with surrounding cartilage.",
        "As observed in Figure 5, untreated cartilage defects displayed limited tissue coverage (Figure 5A). In contrast, cartilage defects treated with a TEC seeded with MSCs demonstrated nearly complete coverage of the defect (Figure 5B).",
        "Morphological assessment of cartilage repair with the MOCART 3D score showed that cartilage repair in knees subjected only to the cartilage defect presented a mean MOCART value of 46.2 with a standard deviation of 13.4. The group treated with a TEC from SM had a mean MOCART value of 65.7 with a standard deviation of 15.5 (p < 0.05), while the mean value obtained was 59.0 with a standard deviation of 7.9 with a TEC from the DP (Figure 6).",
        "Cartilage composition was assessed with T2 mapping, showing a mean value of T2 of 54.9 with a standard deviation of 1.9 in the native cartilage. The untreated group exhibited a mean T2 value of 50.9 with a standard deviation 2.4 (p < 0.05). No difference was found between the native cartilage and the treated groups. The mean T2 value from the group treated with a TEC from the SM was 54.31 with a standard deviation of 2.07, and from the DP was 54.54 with a standard deviation of 1.47 (Figure 7).",
        "When measuring the T2 value by zones of the native cartilage and in the groups that received treatment with a TEC of the PD and SM, there was a decrease comparing the value of the superficial zone and the value of the deep zone. On the other hand, when analyzing the defect group, there was a small increase from the superficial zone to the deep zone, with no significant difference.",
        "The T2 value (mean ± standard deviation) obtained in the superficial zone of the native cartilage (n = 12) was 59.3 ± 2.4 and in the deep zone was 50.7 ± 2.9 (p < 0.001). Considering the DP group (n = 6), the mean T2 value was 57.5 ± 2.7 for the superficial zone and 51.6 ± 2.0 for the deep zone (p < 0.05). For the SM group (n = 6), the mean T2 value was 57.1 ± 3.9 for the superficial zone and 51.5 ± 2.0 for the deep zone (p < 0.05). The defect group (n = 12) presented a mean T2 value of 50.5 ± 4.9 for the superficial zone and 51.4 ± 2.6 for the deep zone.",
        "The quality of the tissue and its intrinsic characteristics were assessed by the ICRS-2 score system (Table 3). The untreated group presented a mean value 42.1 with a standard deviation of 14.8. The group with a TEC from SM had a significant difference in comparison to the untreated group and presented a mean value of 64.3 with a standard deviation of 19.0 (p < 0.05). The group with a TEC from DP presented a mean value of 54.3 with a standard deviation of 12.2 (Figure 8, Figure 9 and Figure 10).",
        "This preclinical study compares cartilage restoration using a scaffold-free tissue engineering construct (TEC) between SM- and DP-derived MSCs. The defect created in this study replicates a focal cartilage injury in the knee, and the miniature pig model closely resembles the human knee. This model is widely used in the literature, given its high relevance for clinical translation in treating knee cartilage defects [19]. It showed better results in the SM group compared to the control in MRI and histological analysis. Additionally, the SM group outperformed the dental pulp (DP) group in MRI assessments.",
        "Mei et al., 2024 [20] highlight the immunosuppressive properties of MSCs, in agreement with what was proven by Li et al., 2009 [21] and other authors, in which human MSCs elicited no immune reactions in miniature pigs, supporting the viability of using heterogeneous cells between species. In addition, Ando et al., 2008 [5] and Shimomura et al. (2010) [22] first reported the feasibility of creating scaffold-free approaches for chondral repair in a swine model using MSCs from the SM. In contrast, the present study is known to be the first to use MSCs from DP and SM to create the TEC and to report the data from histological and imaging evaluation.",
        "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive tool for assessing hyaline cartilage quality, enabling the translation of animal model findings into clinical studies. A pilot study by Shimomura et al., 2023 [23] reported sustained improvements in clinical outcomes and MRI findings five years post-implantation of the TEC, with a mean MOCART 3D score (mean ± standard deviation) of 82.0 ± 13 in the group treated with a TEC. While this score decreased slightly from the two-year follow-up, it increased compared to the six-month follow-up, indicating ongoing efficacy. No control group was used [24].",
        "In the present study, the TEC-treated group also showed significant improvements over the defect-only group, particularly with MSCs derived from the SM. However, the average value of the MOCART 3D score was lower, 65.7 from the SM and 59.0 from the DP, potentially due to the shorter six-month evaluation period compared to the five-year follow-up of Shimomura et al., 2023 [23].",
        "MRI is sensitive to specific changes in the chemical composition and structure of cartilage even before severe morphological changes, and T2 mapping is a technique to assess this aspect and complement morphological evaluation [15,25,26]. In the current study, similar to Theruvath et al., 2021 [27] and Shimomura et al., 2018 [24], significant differences in T2 values were observed between the defect-only and healthy cartilage groups. Shimomura et al., 2018 [24] also demonstrated that T2 values change over time, correlating with the maturation of repair tissue at 6- and 24-weeks post-surgery. Additionally, in the present study, the mean T2 values between native cartilage and the tissue formed by TEC from both groups were comparable after 6 months, suggesting similar tissue compositions.",
        "Variations in T2 values across different cartilage zones reflect compositional differences; higher T2 values in the superficial zone indicate increased water content. This pattern aligns with findings by White et al., 2006 [17] who noted higher T2 values in the superficial regions of equine cartilage, and the present study with groups from native cartilage and TEC treatment derived from DP and SM. Notably, Shimomura et al., 2018 [24] did not observe significant differences in T2 values across various zones, which contrasted with histological assessments.",
        "Histological analysis serves as a valuable complement to cartilage imaging evaluations, offering insights into the intrinsic characteristics and quality of the tissue [14]. Ando et al., 2007 [28] evaluated the histology based on the ICRS-1 in a swine model that received TEC from DP-derived MSCs, and similarly to the present study, the histological repair score in the intervention group was significantly better compared to the defect-only group. Similarly, Shimomura et al., 2018 [24] evaluated repair tissue histology using the ICRS-2 score in patients who underwent TEC treatment, reporting a mean score of 80.0 ± 11.0, although no control group was included.",
        "In the current study, the average ICRS-2 score for the DP-treated group was 54.2 ± 16.1, and for the SM-treated group, it was 64.2 ± 19.0 (p < 0.05), significantly better than the defect group’s score of 42.1 ± 14.7. These differences may be attributed to the evaluation timeline, as the present study assessed tissue at six months post-surgery compared to the 48 weeks used by Shimomura et al., 2018 [24]. Additionally, Gardner et al., 2019 [29] investigated tissue engineering interventions and employed the ICRS-2 scoring system, noting no significant differences at six weeks post-surgery, but significant improvements observed at twelve weeks.",
        "DP-derived MSCs have shown promise for various applications, particularly in treating bone conditions like alveolar clefts [6,9,30]. These cells are easy to collect and can be obtained with minimal donor site morbidity and iatrogenic damage. While some studies have explored their potential for cartilage repair, a comparative analysis of dental pulp-derived MSCs (DPSCs) and synovial membrane-derived MSCs (SMSCs) remains lacking for cartilage injuries and osteoarthritis use [31,32,33]. Additionally, Xu et al., 2023 [34] indicated that SMSCs enhance MRI indices and histological scores, and their use with scaffold-free constructs for cartilage repair is safe and effective, leading to reduced pain, improved function, and higher quality of life and clinical outcomes, which corroborates to the results obtained in this study [34].",
        "One of the limitations of this study is the absence of male animal models. It was decided to use female animals in the research project as part of the strategy to characterize the presence of donor cells.",
        "This translational study presented an active pharmaceutical ingredient derived from tissue engineering therapeutic option known as TEC, for a highly prevalent condition with a high impact on public health. As it does not require an external scaffold, it is safer and can reduce the costs of treating cartilage injuries. As future steps, phase I/II and “first in human” clinical trials may be carried out.",
        "TEC derived from SM led to superior cartilage coverage and quality compared to the defect group in MRI and histological analysis. In the MRI assessment, both DP and SM groups showed better results in comparison to the defect group. In the histological assessment, TEC from SM demonstrated better results than the defect group and had no difference to the treatment with a TEC from the DP.",

Major limitations for the procedure include donor organ shortage, high cost, high level of required expertise, and long-term consequences of immune suppression. Alternative cell-based liver therapies could potentially greatly expand the number of patients provided with effective treatment. Investigative research into augmenting or replacing liver function extends into three general strategies. Bioartificial livers (BALs) are extracorporeal devices that utilize cartridges of primary hepatocytes or cell lines to process patient plasma. Injection of liver cell suspensions aims to foster organ regeneration or provide a missing metabolic function arising from a genetic defect. Tissue engineering recreates the organ in vitro for subsequent implantation to augment or replace patient liver function.

        "Primary human hepatocyte (PHH) transplantation could be an alternative to liver transplantation.

        "Every year, there are 13,000 to 15,000 individuals in the United States on the liver transplantation waitlist. Unfortunately, thousands of these patients each year become too sick to undergo this life-saving procedure or die while awaiting it1. Given the scarcity of donor organs, ~150 patients in the world with over 25 various diseases, including inborn errors of metabolism, acute liver failure, bile duct disorders, and chronic cirrhosis, have received primary human hepatocyte (PHH) transplantation as a treatment and temporary solution to bridge towards liver transplantation2–6. While the clinical outcomes of this procedure show that it is safe, the utilization of PHH therapy remains constrained by poor engraftment efficiency, risk of graft rejection and subsequent loss of long-term benefit, and limited availability of hepatocytes2,7–11. PHH transplantation has also been explored in numerous preclinical mouse models of metabolic disorders affecting hepatocytes, acute liver failure, and cholangiopathies. However, high levels of liver chimerism are achieved only when paired with extreme genetic, chemical, pharmacological, or surgical preconditioning techniques that are not clinically translatable nor relevant models of human liver diseases12–22. These studies created mice with humanized livers that have mainly served as models for studying drug design, viral infections, and metabolism. They also taught valuable lessons that can be leveraged to promote PHH transplantation as a viable cell therapy and alternative to liver transplantation. Based on these clinical and preclinical studies, the consensus in the field is that successful proliferation of PHH grafts and meaningful liver repopulation require regenerative stimuli and a growth advantage for the transplanted cells10, two processes that we investigated here to better enable PHH therapy for liver diseases.",
        "Regenerative stimuli for PHH transplantation have been induced via preoperative portal vein occlusion or partial hepatectomy5,10,21. Not only are the regenerative stimuli from these procedures short-term, but the procedures themselves pose a risk to patients. Alternatively, here we introduce the use of nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) to deliver regenerative stimuli. We have previously validated this approach as efficient, safe, non-integrative, and liver-targeted when the LNP were injected intravenously, enabling transient and robust protein expression in the murine liver23,24. mRNA-LNP safety in humans has been validated with current cancer immunotherapy25 and mRNA-LNP-based COVID-19 vaccines26, as well as in many clinical trials aiming to treat infections, cancer, and genetic disorders27. The regenerative stimuli we deliver are two human hepatocyte mitogens—hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). The HGF/cMET and EGF/EGFR axes, often referred to as the pillars of liver regeneration, are essential during liver development and naturally induced following liver injury in the regeneration process28–31. This is an efficient and translatable way to provide controlled expression of supportive factors to PHHs post transplantation.",
        "Hepatocyte senescence, measured via expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21, is a consistent hallmark of chronic and acute human liver diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with and without cirrhosis, viral hepatitis with and without cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic steatohepatitis with and without cirrhosis, acute liver failure, acetaminophen overdose, and inborn errors of metabolism like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency32–35. Based on the liver disease and its progression, the percentage of p21 positive hepatocytes can reach up to ~90%32,33. This phenomenon is usually considered detrimental to overall liver health but puts such patients in a unique position where their liver environment may provide an inherent advantage to healthy donor PHHs that are readily proliferative if given the right cues. Therefore, in this study, we leveraged this observation by refining two pre-existing mouse models of liver injury, an acute and a chronic model, in which we recapitulated compromised hepatocyte proliferation via a single injection of AAV8-TBG-p21 that induces expression of p21 under the hepatocyte specific thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) promoter36 (Supplementary Fig. 1). In these more clinically accurate liver injury mouse models, our study demonstrates that stimulating key regenerative pathways in transplanted PHHs using human HGF and human EGF (from now on referred to as HGF and EGF) delivered with mRNA-LNP drastically improves PHH engraftment and restores liver function (Supplementary Fig. 1).",
        "As a chronic human liver disease model, we used the NSG-PiZ mouse that recapitulates alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) associated liver disease. These mice are transgenic for the human mutated PiZ allele on immunodeficient NOD scid gamma (NSG) background, allowing them to tolerate xenotransplantation21. These mice have heterogeneous accumulation of cytoplasmic misfolded Z-AAT globules in hepatocytes and develop fibrosis with age, similar to human AATD patients21,33. PiZ mice have been shown to support the engraftment of healthy donor mouse hepatocytes. While PHH engraftment has been observed in NSG-PiZ mice, liver repopulation was modest in comparison to mouse-to-mouse transplantation. Significant PHH engraftment was achieved only with drastic preconditioning methods such as partial hepatectomy, monocrotaline injections, or anti-CD95/FAS antibody treatment, which do not reflect clinically relevant approaches21. Instead, here we refined this injury model to render it more clinically relevant by mimicking p21-associated hepatocyte arrest seen in AATD liver disease patients33, and tested whether mitogen mRNA-LNP treatments improved PHH therapy. To do so, we administered one dose of AAV8-TBG-p21 virus that specifically induces p21 expression in hepatocytes, presumably for the lifespan of the mouse as previously reported36,37. One week after AAV8 injection, nuclear p21 protein was detected in murine hepatocytes (Fig. 1a). We quantified p21+ hepatocytes to be on average 15% in the control AAV8-TBG-Null group and 87% in the AAV8-TBG-p21 group (Fig. 1b). This recapitulates what is observed in human AATD patients that have a range of p21+ hepatocytes up to ~90%, with an average of 12.3% for heterozygous and homozygous patients combined33. We validated the efficiency of the mRNA-LNP delivery system to express protein in the NSG-PiZ diseased livers, as previously shown in healthy livers23, by administering one dose of eGFP mRNA-LNP in NSG-PiZ mice. eGFP was efficiently expressed 5 h after injection in almost all hepatocytes regardless of the presence of the cytoplasmic disease-associated Z-AAT globules (Fig. 1c). We confirmed that there was no hepatotoxicity related to an mRNA-LNP injection, demonstrated by no change in liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme levels 48 h following control firefly luciferase (Luc) mRNA-LNP treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2a). We also observed no hepatocyte apoptosis via TUNEL staining (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Then, the kinetic of expression of mitogens HGF and EGF were evaluated following co-injection of HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP and analyzed 5, 24, 48, and 72 h later. HGF and EGF proteins were abundantly detected in the liver tissue of treated mice, while absent in untreated mice at 0 h (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). Similarly, as HGF and EGF are secreted proteins, circulating serum HGF and EGF peaked at 24 h after administration and decreased by 48 and 72 h (Fig. 1e, f). This general kinetic of mRNA-LNP-induced protein expression in the mouse liver has also been characterized previously by our lab23,24. These data demonstrate that mRNA-LNP mediated HGF and EGF expression is robust and transient in NSG-PiZ mice. Next, we explored the functions of HGF and EGF to induce hepatocyte proliferation and p21 to halt it. NSG-PiZ mice were either administered AAV8-TBG-p21 or no virus. One week later, the mice were given either HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP or control Luc mRNA-LNP treatment, and were analyzed 48 h later, when HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP mediated hepatocyte proliferation is known to be the highest23,24. Mice were injected with 5-Ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) 2 h prior to sacrifice to mark cells that were proliferating during that short window (Fig. 1g). In the absence of p21 injection, HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP induced significant hepatocyte proliferation in comparison to control Luc mRNA-LNP, as demonstrated by significantly increased EdU+ hepatocytes on liver sections (Fig. 1h, i). In contrast, AAV8-TBG-p21 injection one week prior to mRNA-LNP treatment blocked the proliferation induced by HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP (Fig. 1h, i). Altogether, we have established a refined chronic liver injury model recapitulating AATD-associated liver disease harboring both accumulation of polymeric Z-AAT in hepatocytes and nuclear p21 expression in a subset of hepatocytes, as seen in AATD patients33. We demonstrated that in this more clinically accurate non-proliferative host liver context, HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP driven host hepatocyte proliferation is impaired and, thus, suggests that HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP treatment may be a therapeutic strategy to specifically promote the proliferation of transplanted healthy PHHs.Fig. 1HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP induces hepatocyte proliferation in vivo, which is blocked by AAV8-TBG-p21 expression.a Representative images of immunofluorescence staining for p21 in NSG-PiZ livers 1 week after IV administration of AAV8-TBG-p21 or AAV8-TBG-Null vectors. b Quantification of percent p21+ hepatocytes, identified by morphology. n = 3 mice per group.

        "To dissect the mechanism of how HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP promotes PHH engraftment and to investigate the need for p21 expression in host hepatocytes to synergize the effect of HGF and EGF, we analyzed 4 distinct groups of mice (Fig. 2a). The control group was given Luc mRNA-LNP injections only. Single condition groups were given AAV8-TBG-p21 only or HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP only. The combined condition group was given both p21 and HGF + EGF injections. One million PHHs were transplanted as a single cell suspension via intrasplenic injection as routinely performed in mice38. A single dose of AAV8-TBG-p21 was injected one week prior to cell transplantation, while mRNA-LNP were administered 5 h before transplantation and twice weekly for two weeks before mice were sacrificed (Fig. 2a). We chose to analyze cell engraftment during the first 2 weeks post transplantation, early time points that are often neglected in other studies. This helps to specifically examine the benefit of HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP not only on cell proliferation over a short time, but also on cell survival upon initial transplantation. Indeed, improving cell survival is key for efficient and successful cell therapy. Transplanted PHHs were tracked in mouse livers via co-immunostaining using a Ku80 antibody that marks human nuclei39 and a human-specific albumin (hALB) antibody. hALB was also detected via ELISA on the serum, as functional PHHs are expected to express and secrete albumin. In the control group, mostly singlet and doublet hALB+ Ku80+ PHHs were detected. In contrast, in the p21 only and HGF + EGF only groups there was a significant increase in the number of PHH clusters (Fig. 2b, c), indicative of PHH survival. Likewise, there was an increase in the number of PHHs per cluster and the number of EdU+ PHHs per cluster (Fig. 2d, e), both indicative of PHH proliferation. The combined group showed a significant synergy between the p21 injection and HGF + EGF treatments in improving PHH survival and proliferation (Fig. 2b–e). This was also reflected in the highest hALB+ Ku80+ area (Fig. 2f), where the combined treatment group had an 18.6-fold increase over the control group. Serum hALB was measured over time to evaluate the kinetic of PHH transplantation and engraftment globally within the livers, to assess PHH function, and to show the trajectory of human hepatocyte expansion (Fig. 2g). Here we show statistically significant differences among all groups at both 1 and 2 weeks post transplantation, with the highest hALB levels achieved in the combined group as expected (27.4-fold increase vs. control group), followed by the HGF + EGF group (12.1-fold increase), and then the p21 group (4.3-fold increase). Together, these findings demonstrate that inducing p21 expression in hepatocytes to mimic halted host hepatocyte proliferation, as seen in human diseased livers, provides a basal level of engraftment advantage to PHHs. Additionally, in this disease context, treatment with HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP drastically synergizes this advantage by significantly increasing the survival and proliferation of PHHs. These findings suggest that the therapeutic intervention of HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP may successfully improve PHH cell therapy in the clinical context of AATD-associated liver disease where p21 is expressed in hepatocytes.Fig. 2HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP treatments augment PHH engraftment by increasing the survival and proliferation of donor cells in p21/NSG-PiZ mice.a PHH transplantation experimental timeline and treatment groups.

        "Sustained engraftment of functional PHHs over time in the p21/NSG-PiZ mice treated with HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP was further investigated using a similar experimental set up as above. The mRNA-LNP injections were carried out twice weekly for 5 weeks before mice were sacrificed (Fig. 3a). The control group received AAV8-TBG-Null and Luc mRNA-LNP injections, and the experimental group received AAV8-TBG-p21 injection and HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP treatments (Fig. 3a). Here a 5-week treatment scheme was chosen to examine longer-term PHH proliferation, exponential expansion, and engraftment over time in comparison to what has previously been achieved in other PHH transplantation studies21. Sustained engraftment is shown in the experimental group by the presence of large clusters of Ku80+ PHHs across an entire liver lobe compared to the control in which the clusters remained small and sparse (Fig. 3b). This level of engraftment in the experimental group was consistent across all liver lobes and samples (Supplementary Fig. 3a). This difference was further validated with hALB/Ku80/EdU co-staining (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and was quantified by measuring the percent of liver tissue occupied by hALB+ Ku80+ PHHs. On average, ~30% liver repopulation was quantified on liver sections in the experimental group as compared to ~2% in the control group (Fig. 3c), yielding a 14.1-fold increase in the treated group. Importantly, an exponential increase of serum hALB over time was observed in the experimental group with an impressive 37.1-fold increase at 5 weeks compared to the control group (Fig. 3d). Quantification of serum hALB over time is very often used to determine the kinetics of transplantation and engraftment, and as a measure of liver repopulation over time12–16,18–21. At this time, p21 expression was observed in 6% of hepatocytes in the control group and 21% in the treated group (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). This relative decrease in the percentage of p21+ hepatocytes as compared to Fig. 1b can be attributed to the fact that a large portion of the livers in the treated group is now occupied by p21− donor PHHs, which are on average smaller than neighboring mouse hepatocytes. The remaining p21+ cells are mouse host hepatocytes, as expected.Fig. 3HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP treatments lead to sustained and robust engraftment of functional PHHs, which ameliorates liver disease burden and improves overall liver function of p21/NSG-PiZ mice.a PHH transplantation, AAV8 injections, mRNA-LNP injections, EdU injections, serum collection, and tissue harvesting were carried out as previously described.

        "Five weeks post transplantation, smaller clusters of engrafted Ku80+ PHHs were predominantly found in periportal regions, identified by cytokeratin 7 (CK7) expression in bile ducts, and not near pericentral regions, identified with hepatic glutamine synthetase (GS) expression (Supplementary Fig. 5a). This suggests PHHs engraft first in the portal region as expected based on transplantation method. In regions with larger expansion of donor cells, Ku80+ PHHs were found in all zones spanning from periportal, mid-lobular, and pericentral regions (Supplementary Fig. 5b–d). In this case, we found that donor PHHs immediately adjacent to central veins express GS, demonstrating that donor cells appropriately adopt expression of the liver zonation markers where they reside (Supplementary Fig. 5d).",
        "Not only did we see high levels of PHH engraftment in the experimental group, but also an improvement in the AATD-associated liver disease phenotype. Indeed, repopulation with healthy hepatocytes significantly decreased the 2C1+ misfolded Z-AAT polymer area in the liver as compared to the control transplanted group and age-matched NSG-PiZ controls (Fig. 3e, f). The classic periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-Diastase stain that also highlights the load of Z-AAT globules confirmed this same finding (Supplementary Fig. 6). In line with these data, the experimental group had significantly reduced levels of serum Z-AAT, measured with an ELISA specific for human Z-AAT. This decrease was observed when compared to the control transplanted group as well as the age-matched non-transplanted NSG-PiZ mice, which express only human Z-AAT via the transgene, hence benchmarking the baseline serum human Z-AAT in this mouse strain (Fig. 3g). An ELISA that detects total human AAT, both normal M-AAT and misfolded Z-AAT, also revealed that the experimental group has significantly higher levels of total serum AAT compared to age-matched NSG-PiZ mice (Fig. 3h). The FDA-accepted therapeutic threshold for normal M-AAT protein augmentation is 11 µM, which is equivalent to 572 µg/mL. Taken together, these data show that the engraftment achieved in the experimental group is sufficient to reduce circulating Z-AAT and leads to increased secretion of normal AAT over the age-matched non-transplanted NSG-PiZ mice. As expected, the age-matched NSG mice had no human AAT in either normal or misfolded forms (Fig. 3g, h). As an additional liver function assay we measured ALT levels, where elevated levels above the normal range for NSG mice (>32 IU/L) are indicative of liver damage40. ALT levels were significantly lower in the experimental group compared to both the age-matched non-transplanted NSG-PiZ mice as well as the control transplanted group, demonstrating rescue of liver function in the experimental group (Fig. 3i). It is also worth noting here that hepatotoxicity was not observed in these mice after 10 mRNA-LNP injections, confirmed by ALT levels within the expected range in the control and treated transplantation groups (Fig. 3i) and no significant apoptosis detected by TUNEL staining (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). Together, prolonged treatment with HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP leads to sustained and robust engraftment of functional PHHs, reduces the liver disease burden, and restores overall liver function in the clinically relevant p21/NSG-PiZ model.",
        "To expand the translational application of mRNA-LNP with hepatocyte cell therapy to a broader variety of liver diseases, we tested the ability of HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP to improve cell engraftment in the acetaminophen (N-acetyl-para-aminophenol or APAP) overdose model of acute liver injury, which is a leading cause of liver transplantation in the US41. This model is well established to induce severe hepatocyte necrosis around the central vein area and resolves within a week following sub-lethal doses35,42. Given that p21 expression is naturally occurring in hepatocytes, especially those adjacent to the necrotic areas in the liver of APAP overdosed patients43, we recapitulated this context by injecting NSG mice with one dose of AAV8-TBG-p21 virus 2 weeks prior to APAP overdose. Then, APAP was injected to mimic acute sub-lethal overdose35,44, and PHHs were transplanted 24 h later. mRNA-LNP were administered 5 h before transplantation and twice weekly thereafter for 2 weeks (Fig. 4a). The control group was given AAV8-TBG-Null and Luc mRNA-LNP injections, while the experimental group was given one AAV8-TBG-p21 injection and HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP treatments (Fig. 4a). P21 expression was validated in the majority of hepatocytes in the experimental group (Fig. 4b). Liver histological analyses 2 weeks after cell transplantation revealed that clusters of PHHs were mainly singlet and doublet hALB+ Ku80+ cells and were visible in both groups, yet the number of clusters was significantly greater in the experimental group, indicating that HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP treatment promotes PHH survival in the p21/APAP model (Fig. 4c–e). However, PHHs within the clusters were no longer proliferative 2 weeks post transplantation, likely because the injury had naturally recovered by that time (Fig. 4f). In line with the more abundant PHH clusters in the experimental group, the percentage of hALB+ Ku80+ positive area was significantly higher as compared to the control group (Fig. 4g). This result was further validated by a significant increase in serum hALB levels in the experimental group 1 week post transplantation, reflecting global PHH engraftment within entire livers (Fig. 4h). Together, these findings expand the therapeutic indications of HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP for liver cell therapy from chronic to acute liver diseases. We specifically demonstrate that HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP treatments improve the survival and, thus, engraftment of transplanted PHHs in a clinically relevant p21/APAP acute liver injury model.Fig. 4HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP treatment augments PHH engraftment by increasing survival of donor cells in acute p21/APAP overdose model.a PHH transplantation experimental timeline and treatment groups.

        "PHH cell therapy offers advantages over liver transplantation, the current standard of care for end stage liver disease. Donor organ shortage could be addressed with PHH transplantation, as one donor organ could treat multiple patients and offers the convenience of cryopreservation for future use. PHH transplantation is less invasive than liver transplantation and can be repeated. In cases of acute liver injury, PHHs could provide temporary support while the host liver naturally regenerates, bridging the gap to liver transplantation if needed. Although, clinical trials using PHH transplantation to treat liver diseases have shown the safety of the procedure, cell engraftment remains poor. In this study, we explore the potential of mitogenic HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP to improve PHH engraftment to potentiate a viable cell therapy for both chronic and acute liver injuries.",
        "Previous PHH transplantation mouse models achieve significant engraftment levels but require a prolonged 5 to 9-month period post transplantation and harsh preconditioning techniques that are not plausible in a clinical setting. Those approaches included liver irradiation, partial hepatectomy, monocrotaline, anti-CD95 antibodies, induced acute injury, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator transgenes or adenovectors12–22,45,46. Such strategies either create physical room for transplanted cells, inhibit host liver proliferation, or damage the liver parenchyma to allow donor cells to engraft. In addition, regenerative stimuli for PHH engraftment have been induced via portal vein occlusion or partial hepatectomy5,10,21. Although PHH engraftment was successful to varying degrees in these studies, the approaches utilized are not clinically translatable nor represent accurate models of human liver diseases.",
        "In the present work, our focus was on creating a clinically relevant setting to achieve better PHH engraftment in a shorter period to treat a broad range of liver diseases. We propose that the naturally occurring hepatocyte senescence observed in virtually all human liver diseases32,33,43 provides a growth advantage for transplanted PHHs over the host hepatocytes. This is a diseased context that we mimicked in our experimental models by inducing AAV-mediated p21 expression in hepatocytes. Our approach also relies on controlled delivery of hepatocyte regenerative stimuli, HGF and EGF, to the liver using mRNA-LNP23,24, which has been validated as clinically safe with the recent mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. This is an advantageous method of delivery that we pioneered in this study to improve cell therapy, as it leads to robust yet controlled expression of mitogens in the liver23,24. The HGF/cMET axis is an appealing target for improving engraftment, as supported by other cell therapy applications using HGF-expressing adenovectors or cMET agonist antibodies for primary mouse and stem cell-derived hepatocytes, respectively47,48. Synergy between the HGF/cMET and EGF/EGFR axes during liver development and regeneration has been reported by many groups28–31 including ours23, therefore, a combination of both HGF and EGF is used in the present study.",
        "Most of the previous PHH therapy studies analyzed cell engraftment months after transplantation, which does not provide understanding of the mechanism of initial cell repopulation. As a major limitation to successful engraftment is poor cell survival after cell injection, here, we intentionally examine PHH engraftment and function during the first 2 weeks after transplantation. We evaluated the potential of HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP to improve not only cell proliferation but also survival, as this also dictates the rate at which cell repopulation occurs. Our study demonstrates that HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP treatments lead to significantly improved PHH survival upon transplantation, increased proliferation over time, and sustained PHH engraftment for at least 5 weeks in the chronic p21/NSG-PiZ model. Engrafted PHHs contribute to a large percentage of overall liver area, an impressive and clinically relevant 30%. The engrafted cells harbor normal hepatocyte functions, notably secreting high levels of hALB and hAAT above the FDA-accepted protein augmentation therapeutic threshold21. Engraftment of these functional cells reduces misfolded Z-AAT protein burden in liver tissue and sera, and ALT levels are significantly reduced indicating restoration of overall liver function. There is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates a correlation between circulating Z-AAT polymers and overall liver disease in AATD patients, thus, reducing serum Z-AAT is promising for overall patient outcomes49,50. Approximately 3.4 million individuals worldwide carry disease alleles for AATD, with no existing cure for associated liver disease other than liver transplantation51. If the results of our study are translated to human, successful PHH cell therapy offers a potential cure for AATD patients. This cell therapy holds the promise of addressing both liver and lung diseases associated with AATD by ameliorating the gain of function toxicity of Z-AAT in the liver via replacing diseased cells and addressing the loss of function in the lung via restoring normal AAT protein in the serum. We also expanded the clinical application of our approach to possibly accelerate liver regeneration after APAP overdose acute liver injury. Our data reveal that HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP treatment significantly enhances PHH survival, engraftment, and function during the first two weeks after transplantation in a sub-lethal APAP overdose model. Given that APAP overdose is one of the leading causes of liver transplantation in the US41, there is a critical need for alternative therapies for patients who arrive at the emergency room too late to be efficiently treated with the standard of care, N-acetyl cysteine. If our results are translated to human acute liver injury cases, improved PHH therapy with HGF + EGF mRNA-LNP could serve as a bridge to provide time for the host’s natural liver repair process to take over or ultimately for whole organ transplantation.",
        "Overall, our study pioneers the use of the nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP platform to express mitogens in the liver in a controlled manner to drastically improve PHH survival, proliferation, and engraftment, thus, reducing disease burden and enhancing overall liver function. This strategy may overcome the critical barriers to clinical translation of hepatocyte cell therapies, primary or stem cell-derived, for the treatment of various liver diseases.",
        "All animal studies were approved by the Boston University IACUC and were consistent with local, state, and federal regulations as applicable. Animals were housed under standard conditions with a 12-hour day/night cycle in a pathogen-free environment with access to food and water ad libitum. All mice used in Fig. 1 were male and ranged from 7 to 10 weeks old. All mice used for xenotransplantation studies in Figs. 2–4 were male and 7–8 weeks old at the time of transplantation. For chronic injury, the transgenic NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl Tg(SERPINA1*E342K)#Slcw/SzJ (NSG-PiZ) colony was used, mimicking human AATD-associated liver disease. NSG-PiZ mice are homozygous for a transgene expressing the human mutated PiZ allele. For acute liver injury, immunodeficient NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice were used.

The supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended and aliquoted to administer 1 million cells per mouse in ~50 µL HBSS. Cells were kept on ice and immediately transplanted via intrasplenic injection as previously described53. Mice were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail via intraperitoneal injection. BuprenorphineSR painkiller (0.5–1.0 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously to provide 72 h of analgesia. Ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes using the sterile cotton-tipped applicator. Fur was shaved with an electric razor around the spleen area on the left side. Disinfection of the surgical site was performed with iodine pads (Dynarex™ 1108) followed by alcohol wipes, repeated three times. Mice were kept warm with a heating pad under the tail and transferred to the sterile field. Sterile drapes, gloves, and surgical instruments were used. An incision of 1 cm was made with a small scissor on the mouse’s left paralumbar fossa to expose the spleen out of the body. The spleen was kept moist with PBS. One million PHHs resuspended in 50 µL of HBSS were injected into the inferior pole of the spleen using a 27 G tuberculin syringe with an attached needle (BD 305620). Surgifoam gelatin sponge (Ethicon) was used to achieve hemostasis by pressuring a small piece on the injection site for 30 s. The exposed spleen was quickly returned to the abdominal cavity.

    "title": "Cellular therapy and tissue engineering for cartilage repair. repair cartilage using tissue engineering was reported in 1977. Since then, cell-based interventions have entered clinical practice in orthopaedics, and several tissue engineering approaches to repair cartilage are in the translational pipeline towards clinical application. Classically, these involve a scaffold, substrate or matrix to provide structure, and cells such as chondrocytes or mesenchymal stromal cells to generate the tissue. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the use of various cell types, natural and synthetic scaffolds, multiphasic or gradient-based scaffolds, and self-organizing or self-assembling scaffold-free systems, for the engineering of cartilage constructs. Several challenges persist including achieving zonal tissue organization and integration with the surrounding tissue upon implantation. Approaches to improve cartilage thickness, organization and mechanical properties include mechanical stimulation, culture under hypoxic conditions, and stimulation with growth factors or other macromolecules. In addition, advanced technologies such as bioreactors, biosensors and 3D bioprinting are actively being explored. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of action of cell therapy and tissue engineering approaches will help improve and refine therapy development. Finally, we discuss recent studies of the intrinsic cellular and molecular mechanisms of cartilage repair that have identified novel signals and targets and are inspiring the development of molecular therapies to enhance the recruitment and cartilage reparative activity of joint-resident stem and progenitor cells.

        "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex, multifactorial chronic disorder affecting the entire joint, including bone and cartilage, leading to reduced mobility and disability [1]. Based on the Global Burden of Disease 2021 estimates, OA affected 7.6% of the global population, representing approximately 595 million individuals, with a higher prevalence in women than in men [2]. Pharmacological medicines mainly provide relief from symptoms, and no definitive therapy exists to stop the progression of the disease [3]. Although the precise mechanisms underlying OA are not yet fully understood, inflammation and cartilage degeneration through matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) enzymes and a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs (ADAMTS) family proteins are the main contributors to OA pathogenesis [4,5]. Multiple molecular pathways are implicated in the development of OA. The Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β/SMAD pathways, which regulate chondrocyte homeostasis and cartilage metabolism; the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which mediate inflammatory responses; along with the Akt/mTOR/PI3K and oxidative stress pathways, which contribute to autophagy, chondrocyte apoptosis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, are considered among the main pathways involved in OA [6,7].",
        "Genetics plays a significant role in the development of OA and involves the interplay of multiple genes [8,9]. Over 100 genomic risk loci associated with OA have been identified in large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [10]. Type II collagen (COL2A1), COL9A2, COL11A1, COL11A2, COL1A1, COMP, AGC1, and TGFβ1, which are related to cartilage metabolism, and inflammatory genes that encode cytokines such as interleukin-1 alpha (IL1A) and IL1B, are key genes related to OA [11,12,13]. Epigenetic factors, which involve heritable alterations in DNA structure without changing the primary DNA sequence, also interact with genetic risk loci and contribute to the pathogenesis of OA [14]. Recent studies on the epigenetics of OA have focused on DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs. DNA methylation affects the expression of key genes such as SOX9, IL1B [15], 15-LOX, and DP1 [16,17]. Histone modifications (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H3K4me3) also influence chromatin organization and the expression of OA-related genes [18,19,20]. Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (e.g., miR-7, miR-136), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) such as HOTAIR and MALAT1, and circular RNAs (circRNAs) like circ_0136474, are additional components of the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in OA [21]. In addition to epigenetic changes at the DNA level, modifications at the RNA level may also play a role in the pathogenesis of OA.",
        "Epitranscriptomic modifications refer to reversible biochemical alterations, such as methylation, acetylation, pseudouridylation, and phosphorylation, that occur in RNA after transcription [22]. These modifications influence RNA structure, stability, and localization, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression [23]. Several studies indicate that disruptions in RNA modification processes may contribute to the pathogenesis of different diseases; however, despite growing interest, their role in OA pathogenesis remains unclear [24]. In this article, we aim to review epitranscriptomic studies related to OA to elucidate the roles of these modifications in the onset and/or progression of the disease. To date, most review articles in this field have focused on epigenetic modifications [18,25,26,27] or exclusively on m6A [28]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review to address all types of epitranscriptomic modifications investigated in the context of OA.",
        "Epitranscriptomic modifications refer to the post- or co-transcriptional alterations in all types of RNA, including coding messenger RNA (mRNA) and non-coding RNA, such as structural and regulatory RNAs [29]. To date, over 170 distinct types of chemical modifications have been identified in all types of living organisms [30]. Various biochemical groups, such as methyl and acetyl groups, can be enzymatically added to different nucleotides within the RNA structure. For instance, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a modification in which a methyl group is added to the nitrogen at the sixth position of the adenine base in RNA. Similarly, N1-methyladenosine (m1A) refers to methylation at the nitrogen at position 1 of adenine, 5-methylcytidine (m5C) involves methylation at the carbon at position 5 of cytidine, and N7-methylguanosine (m7G) is characterized by methylation at the nitrogen at position 7 of guanosine (Figure 1) [31].",
        "Recent advances in high-throughput methods have identified substantial amounts of epitranscriptome sequencing data, enabling the detection of both known and novel RNA modification sites [32]; however, the exact prevalence, biological roles, and functional mechanisms of many RNA modifications remain unclear [33]. Radioactive labeling and bisulfite sequencing were the earliest techniques utilized to identify adenine-specific tRNA methylase activity and detect cytosine methylation (5-methylcytosine) positions. Subsequently, chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry allowed for the isolation and precise quantification of methylated nucleotides in mRNA and small RNAs, such as miRNAs. In addition, the combination of immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing has facilitated high-resolution mapping of modifications. Furthermore, cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and protein nanopore-based sequencing, along with bioinformatics tools like MeTDiff, have significantly improved the differential analysis of RNA modifications in recent years [34]. RNA modifications are catalyzed by RNA-modifying proteins (RMPs), which can be classified into three main groups: “the writers”, “the readers/ modifiers”, and “the erasers” [35,36,37] (Figure 2).",
        "Writers. “Writers” are enzymes responsible for catalyzing RNA modification reactions by adding chemical groups such as methyl, acetyl, or pseudouridine to specific nucleotides or functional sites within the RNA molecule [38]. These enzymes demonstrate specificity based on the type of modification and the target RNA molecule. Several key writer enzymes are critical for RNA modifications, regulating RNA metabolism, stability, and decoding efficiency. Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and METTL14 constitute the core of the m6A methyltransferase complex, catalyzing m6A, the most prevalent internal mRNA modification. Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) functions as a regulatory subunit, facilitating the m6A reaction by interacting with METTL3/METTL14. NSUN2 and DNMT2 are key m5C writer enzymes, contributing to RNA stability and function. The RNMT/RAM complex, along with the METTL1/WDR4 complex, serves as a writer enzyme for the m7G modification, which plays a crucial role in RNA capping and translation regulation. Additionally, PUS1, PUS7, and PUS10 mediate pseudouridylation (Ψ), a modification that enhances RNA structural integrity and functionality [35].",
        "Readers. The second group of RNA modifiers consists of “readers” that specifically recognize and bind to chemically modified nucleotides in RNA molecules to interpret the regulatory roles of RNA modifications by mediating various biological processes, such as translation initiation, mRNA decay, and splicing [38]. For instance, YTH domain-containing proteins and the IGF2BP1/2/3 family act as readers in m6A modifications and regulate mRNA stability, decay, and translation efficiency. ALYREF and YBX1 are key readers in m5C modifications, which promote nuclear export and mRNA stabilization. EIF4E is a key reader of m7G modifications, which enhance cap-dependent translation initiation. PUS-binding proteins are recognized as readers of Ψ modifications, which can specifically recognize pseudouridylated sites and mediate the interaction with regulatory factors that modulate RNA processing, localization, stability, or translation [39].",
        "Erasers. The final group of enzymes, known as “erasers”, is responsible for removing chemical modifications that influence RNA metabolism [38]. In m6A modification, fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and AlkB Homolog 5 (ALKBH5) serve as key demethylases, and regulate RNA stability, splicing, and translation. In m5C modification, the ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzyme family, particularly TET2, is implicated in the oxidative demethylation of m5C residues, thereby affecting RNA processing [40]. To date, no specific eraser enzyme has been identified for the m7G modification. Similarly, no dedicated eraser has been characterized for 2′-O-methylation, and due to its stable chemical structure, it is likely to represent an irreversible modification [41,42].",
        "These chemical modifications and their enzymes are essential regulators of the gene expression process. They are involved in RNA processing steps, including RNA splicing, transcript stability, translation, and RNA–protein interactions [43]. Therefore, dysregulation in these processes has been implicated in the development of various human diseases [44].",
        "Among the various types of RNA modifications identified, m6A, m5C, m7G, Ψ, and 2′O have been extensively studied [45]. Although it remains unclear whether epitranscriptomic modifications per se contribute to disease pathogenesis [24], several studies have identified dysregulated expression patterns of their modifiers in OA tissues [46,47]. In a bioinformatic study conducted on OA datasets collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), 12 genes involved in epitranscriptomic RNA modifications were identified. Among these, METTL3 was upregulated, while ALKBH1, EIF3, IGF2BP3, and YTHDC1 were downregulated [46]. However, another bioinformatic investigation reported that METTL3 levels were lower in OA patients than in healthy controls [48]. Interestingly, a genetic epidemiology study suggests that METTL3 gene polymorphisms contribute to the susceptibility to knee OA (KOA) in individuals from Southern China. The rs1061026 variant was linked to a higher risk, whereas rs1139130 and rs1263802 were associated with a decreased risk of KOA [49]. Additional studies showed that the level of YTHDF2, a crucial m6A regulator, was decreased [50], while YTHDF3 and IGFBP2 were upregulated in OA patients compared to healthy groups [51]. In conclusion, the expression levels of writer enzymes such as METTL3 are elevated in OA patients compared to healthy individuals, and increased RNA modifications, particularly methylation, appear to be involved in OA pathogenesis; therefore, inhibiting these alterations may represent a potential therapeutic approach. In the following sections, we will discuss various types of RNA modifications identified in OA, beginning with m6A, which is the most well-characterized modification affecting both coding and non-coding RNAs.",
        "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) refers to an epigenetic change characterized by the transfer of a methyl group at the N-6 position of adenosine in RNA molecules. This modification typically occurs in the 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) near stop codons and follows the consensus sequence RRACH (R: G or A; H: A, C, or U) [52,53]. This highly conserved process is conducted by a multicomponent enzyme complex (MTC), which includes methyltransferases (m6A writers) responsible for adding the methyl group, demethylases (m6A erasers) that remove it, and regulatory proteins (m6A readers) that recognize and bind to the m6A modification site in RNA [54]. METTL3, as the key catalytic component, METTL14 as a stabilizing supplement for METTL3, and Wilms tumor suppressor-1-associated protein (WTAP), as a regulatory element, are considered the main methyltransferases [52]. Additional writers have been identified in recent years, including METTL5 [55], METTL16 [56], KIAA1429 [57], and RBM15 [58]. YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, YTHDC1, and YTHDC2, containing the YTH domain (YT521-B homology), are the most important readers involved in m6A methylation, with YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 promoting translation, YTHDF2 mediating mRNA degradation, YTHDC1 facilitating nuclear export, and YTHDC2 functioning as a helicase [59,60]. Finally, FTO and ALKBH5 are two main demethylases belonging to the dioxygenase family of enzymes, which remove m6A methylation [54]. In this part, we will discuss the effects of m6A modification on mRNA transcripts, microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs in OA pathogenesis [50].",
        "m6A modification regulates the expression of genes involved in various processes recognized for their role in the pathogenesis of OA, such as inflammation, ECM degeneration, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, cellular senescence, and autophagy (Table 1) [31,61,62].",
        "Inflammation plays a crucial role in the progression of OA and is influenced by both joint-resident and systemically derived immune cells [63]. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) activate innate immune receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), leading to local inflammation and unexpected flare-ups. Several studies have reported that altered expression of m6A RNA modification regulators, including METTL3, YTHDC1, and FTO, affects inflammatory events and the regulation of the immune microenvironment. This is especially true for macrophage polarization, the transition from the M1 to M2 phenotype, and the infiltration and activation of various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells [50,51,64,65,66]. Bioinformatics analysis identified 122 differentially expressed m6A-related genes in OA. Among them, YTHDF2, a key m6A reader involved in RNA degradation, was significantly downregulated. Its reduced expression promotes pro-inflammatory M1 polarization and inhibits anti-inflammatory M2 polarization [64]. An in vivo study in 6–8-week-old C57BL/6 mice confirmed that YTHDF2 promotes p53 mRNA degradation in M2 macrophages and suppresses NF-κB, p38, and JNK signaling pathways in M1 macrophages, thereby modulating inflammatory gene expression [64]. Analysis of gene expression data from 63 OA and 59 healthy samples in the GEO database, along with validation in 10 OA and 10 normal tissue samples, revealed altered expression of YTHDF2 and IGFBP2 in OA compared to healthy samples. YTHDF2 was downregulated, leading to a decrease in regulatory T cells (Tregs). Conversely, IGFBP2 was upregulated, which negatively affected dendritic cells (DCs) and decreased DCs in OA tissues [51]. IGF2BP3 is another regulator of RNA modification implicated in OA pathogenesis. Analysis of patient-derived samples showed upregulation of six m6A regulators in OA synovium, including FTO, YTHDC1, METTL5, IGF2BP3, ZC3H13, and HNRNPC. Further mechanistic investigations demonstrated that IGF2BP3 upregulation promotes synovial inflammation by enhancing M1 macrophage polarization, in contrast to the activity of YTHDF2, and has an indirect relationship with M2 polarization [67]. Variations in METTL3 genes, another key regulator, have been associated with an increased risk of OA, mainly by influencing the shift from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Bioinformatic analysis also confirmed that METTL3 was downregulated in OA patients, while FTO was upregulated, both contributing to inflammation and immune cell infiltration in OA patients [48]. WTAP, a co-writer in m6A modification, activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by stabilizing its inhibitor, FRZB mRNA, through an m6A-dependent mechanism. Notably, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway contributes to the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. Thus, it may enhance inflammation and sustain inflammatory responses [68,69]. ALKBH8 and YTHDF3 were also significantly upregulated in OA patients. Conversely, WDR4, an m7G modifier, as well as RPUSD4, PUS1, NUDT21, and FBL, were downregulated compared to healthy individuals. These molecular changes are closely related to immuno-inflammatory regulation, particularly involving the infiltration of activated B cells, activated CD8+ T cells, type II helper T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and eosinophils [70,71,72]. Therefore, it is possible that m6A modification contributes to enhanced inflammation in OA by regulating immune cell polarization, promoting pro-inflammatory responses, and disrupting immune homeostasis.",
        "ECM degradation is the main hallmark of OA, which is mediated by important enzymes such as MMPs and ADAMTSs [73,74]. Different MMPs contribute to cartilage ECM degradation and tissue remodeling, such as collagenases (e.g., MMP-1, MMP-13), gelatinases (e.g., MMP-2, MMP-9), and stromelysins (e.g., MMP-3, MMP-10) [75]. RNA modification, particularly m6A methylation, modulates the expression of genes involved in cartilage ECM degradation [61]. In line with this, reduced METTL3 expression and m6A methylation have been observed in IL-1β-treated SW1353 cells and OA cartilage samples. Overexpression of METTL3 via a lentiviral vector regulates MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, and TIMP-1/2 at both mRNA and protein levels. Therefore, METTL3 may be involved in the pathogenesis of OA by regulating the balance between matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, and thus affecting cartilage ECM homeostasis [61]. In another study, silencing of METTL3 by using specific shRNA in an OA mouse model decreased the levels of MMP-13 and increased collagen type II (COL2A1) levels [76]. To better understand the role of METTL3, mechanical tension was applied to chondrocytes using the FX-5000 Tension System. The results demonstrated that METTL3 mediated SOX9 mRNA methylation and reduced its stability, which in turn suppressed COL2A1 expression and decreased ECM synthesis [77]. Furthermore, targeting METTL3 in a mouse model of OA and chondrocyte culture increased the levels of COL2A1 and aggrecan, while ADAMTS5 and MMP-13 levels decreased, significantly alleviating OA symptoms [78]. METTL3 also enhances the methylation of STAT1 mRNA, resulting in increased stability and translation. STAT1 regulates the expression of immune and inflammatory genes, including ADAMTS12, which encodes a metalloprotease involved in ECM degradation. Elevated STAT1 activity promotes ADAMTS12 expression, contributing to ECM degeneration and inflammation in OA [79]. Therefore, the METTL3/STAT1 axis might be an important target for novel therapeutic strategies in OA treatment.",
        "Ribosomal protein L38 (Rpl38) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (Socs2) are two other proteins that might be implicated in the degradation of ECM and can be modified by METTL3 activity. In OA cartilage, RPL38 is upregulated while SOCS2 is downregulated. Silencing RPL38, by using si-RPL38, increases SOCS2 expression through METTL3-mediated methylation, modulating the JAK/STAT3 pathway and reducing apoptosis and ECM degeneration [80]. These findings indicate that targeting RPL38/SOCS2 may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for OA management.",
        "METTL3 not only regulates mRNAs under OA conditions but also impacts ECM degradation-related gene expression in Kashin–Beck disease (KBD), a type of osteoarthropathy with characteristics similar to OA. Combined m6A MeRIP-Seq and RNA-Seq analysis of peripheral blood samples from three KBD patients identified six hypermethylated and upregulated genes, and 23 hypomethylated and downregulated genes compared to controls [81]. Trichothecene mycotoxin-2 (T-2 toxin) has an important role in KBD progression. It has also been shown that T-2 toxin regulates m6A modification of Ctsk mRNA, a cysteine protease involved in bone and joint disorders, by contributing to ECM degeneration. Therefore, METTL3 may influence the disease process by interacting with T2 toxin and the methylation of the Ctsk mRNA gene [82]. Besides METTL3, WTAP may also play a role in ECM degradation, leading to OA [83]. Additional studies have demonstrated that carbonic anhydrase XII (CA XII/12) enzyme levels are increased in the knee cartilage of OA patients [83,84]. WTAP enhances CA12 mRNA stability via m6A methylation, promoting oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and cartilage degeneration in the destabilization medial meniscus (DMM) mouse models. Silencing CA12 using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) reduces ROS and MDA production, along with increasing catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, which ultimately attenuate apoptosis and ECM degradation [83,85]. As previously mentioned, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is implicated in OA through the regulation of various mechanisms. FRZB, a key inhibitor of this pathway, is reduced in OA. WTAP destabilizes FRZB mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner, leading to Wnt/β-catenin activation, cartilage degradation, and OA progression [68]. Besides writers, demethylase enzymes, known as erasers, and proteins that function as readers also contribute to disease conditions. In two separate studies, conducted using a murine model of intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) [86] and an MIA (monosodium iodoacetate) mouse model simulating OA [87], it was found that ALKBH5 induces demethylation in the 3′-UTR region of Runx2 mRNA, enhancing its stability in a YTHDF1-dependent manner. The increased level of Runx2 leads to the upregulation of ADAMTSs and MMPs, ECM degradation, and the progression of IVDD and OA. Therefore, the demethylation of Runx2 mRNA might be associated with ECM degradation and contribute to OA pathogenesis [86,87]. During OA, m6A modification is upregulated due to the increased activity of methylase enzymes, while the expression of the demethylase FTO is decreased. Under normal conditions, RUNX1 regulates FTO expression by binding to specific sites on the FTO promoter, stabilizing SAMD2, and regulating TGF-β signaling. However, in OA tissues, the dysfunction of RUNX1-mediated FTO transcription leads to decreased FTO expression, which in turn causes reduced demethylation and instability of SMAD2 mRNA, leading to TGF-β signaling disruption [88]. Interestingly, chondrocytes from heterozygous FTO-cKO mice showed increased levels of MMP-3 and MMP-13, while COL2A1, Aggrecan, and SOX9 protein expression were significantly decreased. Therefore, FTO influences OA by modulating ECM degradation and synthesis through its effects on SAMD2 and other key genes [88].",
        "Ferroptosis, a type of regulated cell death caused by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, is one of the fundamental mechanisms involved in OA [89]. RNA modifications and their related regulators modulate this process [62,90,91]. During ferroptosis, glutathione (GSH) levels decline due to glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibition, leading to iron-dependent ROS accumulation, increased chondrocyte susceptibility to oxidative stress, and ECM degradation. In IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes, elevated METTL14 and MMP-13 levels are associated with reduced GPX4 and collagen II expression [62,91]. Knockdown of METTL14 using three siRNAs in primary mouse chondrocytes inhibited ferroptosis and ECM degradation by suppressing m6A methylation of GPX4 mRNA [62]. Similar to METTL14, METTL3 influences ferroptosis in chondrocytes during KOA. Ferroptosis activators such as Erastin, RSL3, sorafenib, and FIN56 elevate the level of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) via METTL3-mediated m6A methylation, contributing to cartilage damage and pain. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that knocking down METTL3 in IL-1β-treated cells can significantly reduce HMGB1 levels, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis and attenuating inflammation, cartilage damage, and pain [90]. YTHDF1, a reader, also modulates ferroptosis in bone and joint diseases. It has been shown that YTHDF1 regulates ferroptosis in NPCs by upregulating SLC7A11 and through its involvement in GSH synthesis. Overexpression of YTHDF1, along with Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1), suppresses NPC ferroptosis by enhancing SLC7A11 protein expression after binding to SLC7A11 mRNA [91].",
        "Pyroptosis is another type of programmed cell death triggered by inflammation, and evidence of this process, such as increased levels of pyroptosis-related cytokines, has been detected in OA chondrocytes [92]. Six RNA modification-related genes (ADAMDEC1, IGHM, OGN, TNFRSF11B, SCARA3, and PTN), along with six hub genes linked to pyroptosis and RNA modification, including CXCL10, CXCL9, CCR7, CCL5, CXCL1, and CCR2, were recognized as potential biomarkers for the pathogenesis of OA and RA [31]. Epitranscriptomic RNA modifications, such as methylation, influence pyroptosis in OA and other bone diseases [93,94]. NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7), a key regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, is increased in OA samples. Inhibition of METTL3 expression modulates m6A modification and reduces NEK7 mRNA levels, thereby suppressing chondrocyte pyroptosis and slowing OA progression in both in vitro and in vivo models [93].",
        "Cellular senescence plays a significant role in the aging process and contributes to the development of OA [95,96]. A comprehensive study utilizing three models of cellular senescence demonstrated that the m6A methylation process, assisted by the IGF2BP1 reader, enhances mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) senescence by affecting the stability of CYP1B1 mRNA, which is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily with monooxygenase activity. Moreover, CYP1B1 was identified as an important downstream target of ALKBH5, such that its overexpression improved MSC efficacy and decreased cell senescence in an OA mouse model [95]. In another osteoporosis animal model, IGF2BP2 expression increased in aging osteoblasts under mechanical stress and H2O2 exposure, which promotes osteoblast senescence by improving the stability of Slc1a5 mRNA and inhibiting cell cycle progression. Furthermore, it has been found that overexpression of METTL3 promotes osteoblast senescence, while treatment with Cpd-564, a specific METTL3 inhibitor, along with IGF2BP2 siRNA, leads to increased bone mass and decreased senescence in aged rats [97].",
        "Autophagy is an important process in the pathogenesis of OA [96]. Although autophagy acts as a protective mechanism in the early stages by preventing cell death, uncontrolled autophagic activity in advanced OA may lead to cellular damage [98]. M6A has been shown to modulate the expression of autophagy-related (ATG) genes by affecting mRNA splicing, stability, and degradation [99]. Aged fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLSs) induce chondrocyte senescence, contributing to cartilage damage. Impaired autophagy in OA-FLS increases senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), worsening joint degeneration. METTL3-mediated m6A modification decreases the stability of autophagy-related 7 (ATG7) mRNA, which promotes FLS senescence. Silencing METTL3 improves autophagic flux, decreases SASP, and relieves cartilage destruction in a mouse OA model [100]. Moreover, Lv et al. [101] reported that chondrocyte-derived exosomes contribute to OA via the long non-coding RNA OANCT, which binds to FTO and activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This inhibits autophagy and promotes M1 macrophage polarization, leading to increased inflammation and cartilage degradation [101]. These findings highlight the complex interplay between m6A modification and autophagy in OA, suggesting that precise regulation of this pathway could hold therapeutic potential for mitigating OA.",
        "Effects of m6A Modification on mRNAs Involved in OA Pathogenic Pathways.",
        "This table summarizes the role of m6A modification in OA, emphasizing its impact on key pathogenic mechanisms such as inflammation, extracellular matrix degradation, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, cell senescence, and autophagy. It includes the modified targets (proteins, mRNA, and signaling pathways), study model (in vitro or in vivo), and their effects on the pathogenesis of OA.",
        "In addition to mRNAs, m6A modification also targets non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs involved in OA (Table 2).",
        "MiR-126-5p plays a crucial role in suppressing the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in OA pathogenesis [102]. METTL3, in association with the protein DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8), modulates the maturation of miR-126-5p and suppresses the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. However, when METTL3 is inhibited, the maturation of miR-126-5p is disrupted, which allows the PI3K/Akt pathway to function normally. This contributes to the suppression of inflammation and ECM repair [102]. WTAP may also be involved in OA by regulating miRNAs, such as miR-92b-5p [103]. A study using human OA chondrocytes found that WTAP promotes the maturation of pri-miR-92b into miR-92b-5p, thereby enhancing its inhibitory effects on TIMP4 mRNA. This process facilitates the degradation of TIMP4 mRNA. Together, these data indicate that WTAP and its target microRNA, pri-miR-92p, are involved in the pathogenesis of OA [103]. In addition to methylases, m6A demethylase enzymes such as FTO also modulate miRNAs and contribute to OA pathogenesis. It has been demonstrated that FTO levels are decreased in LPS-treated C28/I2 cells and rat models of OA. In interaction with the protein DGCR8, this methylase modulates pri-miR-515-5p activity in an m6A-dependent manner. Since TLR4 is a direct target of miR-515-5p, the MyD88/NF-κB pathway is activated, leading to inflammation and apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of FTO represses the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB axis, thereby attenuating OA pathogenesis [104]. FTO also regulates the maturation of pri-miR-3591 through demethylation and decreases its inhibitory effect on PRKAA2 mRNA. Increased PRKAA2 levels stimulate the AMP-activated protein kinase (PRKAA1/2), also known as the AMPK pathway, which mitigates cartilage damage by promoting cell proliferation and suppressing apoptosis [105].",
        "LncRNAs are another group of target molecules for RNA modifications, which can serve as underlying mechanisms in OA pathogenesis. Mechanistic analysis in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes revealed that the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 methylates LINC00680, which leads to its upregulation. LINC00680 interacts with SIRT1 mRNA by binding to the m6A site on its 3′-UTR, improving its stability. It is noteworthy that SIRT1 plays a protective role in OA by exhibiting anti-catabolic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress, and anti-apoptotic effects. Therefore, METTL3 may regulate OA progression by modulating the LINC00680/SIRT1 axis [106]. In contrast to LINC00680, ENST00000512512.1, also known as IGFBP7-OT, is another lncRNA upregulated in OA and positively correlated with the severity of cartilage damage. M6A modification enhances IGFBP7-OT levels by regulating the DNMT1/DNMT3a-IGFBP7 axis and DNA methylation processes. The increase in IGFBP7 significantly suppresses chondrocyte viability, stimulates chondrocyte apoptosis, and leads to the degradation of ECM components. Therefore, targeting IGFBP7-OT could be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating OA [107]. Research conducted using a mouse model of OA showed that METTL14 also plays a role in modulating the expression of LncRNAs involved in ECM degeneration. METTL14 facilitated cartilage damage in OA mice by upregulating FAS-AS1 and activating JAK/STAT3 signaling. FAS-AS1 increased ADAM8 mRNA stability by binding to FMR1, which in turn activates JAK/STAT3 signaling, leading to OA chondrocyte apoptosis and ECM degradation [108].",
        "LncRNA NORAD is upregulated in NPCs in the IVDD cell model. WTAP, in association with YTHDF2, enhances the m6A modification of NORAD, which interacts with PUM1/2, RNA-binding proteins that operate as negative regulators of gene expression. PUM1/2 represses the expression of target E2F transcription factor 3 (E2F3) mRNA, thereby promoting cellular senescence and contributing to IVDD progression [109].",
        "Furthermore, m6A demethylases such as FTO, like methylases, regulate OA by modulating lncRNAs. AC008440.5 (AC008) is highly expressed in OA cartilage and contributes to chondrocyte apoptosis, ECM degradation, and OA progression by suppressing the miR-328-3p/ANKH pathway. Importantly, FTO downregulates AC008 transcription through demethylation, leading to increased miR-328-3p levels, specifically targeting AQP1 and ANKH. This regulatory mechanism enhances chondrocyte viability and reduces apoptosis and ECM degradation [110]. ALKBH5 is another m6A demethylase that regulates lncRNA expression and activity. HS3ST3B1-IT1 is decreased in OA, and its overexpression has been shown to ameliorate MIA-induced OA in rats [111]. This lncRNA belongs to the 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST) family, a group of enzymes involved in heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis and interactions with key proteins that regulate cartilage homeostasis. ALKBH5 enhances HS3ST3B1-IT1 RNA stability and expression through demethylation in human OA cartilage [111]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that ALKBH5-mediated demethylation of lncRNAs positively modulates the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). ALKBH5 regulates the AK311120 lncRNA, which interacts with RNA-binding proteins such as DExH-box helicase 9 (DHX9) and YTHDC2. This interaction mediates the downregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAP2K7) and the JNK signaling pathway, promoting osteogenesis [112]. The m6A demethylation of lncRNAs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IVDD. ZFP217, in association with the FTO, demethylates lncRNA LOC102555094, which in turn activates the miR-431/GSK-3β/Wnt pathway. This activation disrupts glucose metabolism in NP cells, contributing to the development of IDD [113].",
        "Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of OA [114]. circMYO1C is an m6A-modified circRNA with m6A characteristics that increase in OA in vitro/in vivo models, and its knockdown suppresses inflammatory factors such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8. This circRNA targets the circMYO1C/m6A/HMGB1 axis and upregulates its stability and levels, contributing to inflammation and chondrocytes apoptosis in OA [115]. In contrast to circMYO1C, circRERE levels are decreased in OA. This reduction is likely due to increased m6A modifications on circRERE, which makes it more prone to degradation by the YTHDF2-HRSP12-RNase P/MRP complex. The breakdown of circRERE dysregulates its downstream miR-195-5p/IRF2BPL/β-catenin pathway, leading to an imbalance in β-catenin that may contribute to OA development [116]. Concerning the impact of m6A on circRNAs associated with proliferation, in vitro observations in antler chondrocyte cell culture demonstrated that the m6A reader YTHDC1 facilitates the nuclear export of circRNA3634 in an m6A-dependent manner. This circRNA, by binding to miR-124486-5, regulates MAPK1 expression and enhances the proliferation and migration of antler chondrocytes [114].",
        "Effects of m6A Modification on Non-Coding RNAs Involved in OA.",
        "This table summarizes the effects of m6A modification on non-coding RNAs in OA. It includes the modified targets (microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs), study models (in vitro, in vivo), and their effects on OA.",
        "5-Methylcytosine (m5C) is another post-transcriptional RNA methylation that occurs in various types of RNA, including mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA, though it is most prevalent in tRNAs [117]. Furthermore, m5C modifications are found in long non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs, and small nuclear RNAs [40]. The modified site in mRNA is mainly located in the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR), in tRNA at the junction between the variable loop and the T stem-loop, and in rRNA within the 18S and 25S rRNAs [118,119]. The m5C writers, which add a methyl group (-CH3) to the 5th carbon of cytosine, include the NOL1/NOP2/SUN domain (NSUN) family and DNA methyltransferase 2 (DNMT2). The ten-eleven translocation (TET) family proteins are proposed as m5C erasers, which oxidize m5C into cytosine-5-hydroxymethylation (hm5C) in RNA, particularly mRNA. YBX1 and ALYREF are recognized as m5C readers that can identify methylated cytosines in GC-rich regions of RNA [120]. The m5C modification is involved in RNA processing steps, including tRNA stability and rRNA assembly [121]. Alterations in m5C methylation have been shown to affect various biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and aging [121]. Using MeRIP-Seq, Yu and colleagues demonstrated that m5C modification affects the expression of 133 genes related to OA. Among these, MMP-14 and COL1A1 are identified as hub genes involved in collagen and ECM degradation, suggesting their potential role in OA pathogenesis and as therapeutic targets [122]. In another study, data from an OA cohort obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus, m5C regulators were found to be differentially expressed in OA compared to normal samples, which might serve as novel biomarkers for OA diagnosis. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses indicated that some of these genes were involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial autophagy, and immune infiltration [123]. Notably, CRISPR screening on mitochondrial RNA in HEK-293T cells has indicated that NSUN4 might be a key regulator of mt-dsRNA expression [124]. Regarding the impact of m5C on cell differentiation, it has been demonstrated that NSUN4, along with METTL3, regulates the chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs through methylation of the 3′ UTR of Sox9 mRNA, which promotes cartilage repair and provides a potential therapeutic target for clinical applications [125].",
        "M7G is a highly conserved RNA modification involving the addition of a methyl group to the N7 position of guanosine either at the 5′ cap of mRNA, as the m7G cap, or at internal positions within mRNAs, tRNAs [126]. The RNMT/RAM complex is the primary m7G methyltransferase responsible for adding the m7G cap to mRNAs in humans, while the METTL1/WDR4 complex acts as a writer enzyme for m7G modification at internal RNA sites, particularly in tRNAs [127]. Nevertheless, m7G erasers and readers have not yet been fully identified. Similar to other types of modifications, m7G plays a crucial role in RNA metabolic processes, including splicing, stability, transcription, translation, and nuclear export [41]. Recent studies have demonstrated that m7G modification may be implicated in different diseases, including OA [128]. Analysis of three GEO datasets identified eighteen m7G-related regulatory factors in OA, among which nine M7G regulators exhibited statistically significant differences. Hao et al. identified four key m7G regulators, including EIF4E2, DCP2, SNUPN, and LARP1, as potential biomarkers for OA. They designed a diagnostic model based on these four genes, which successfully distinguished OA patients from healthy individuals and differentiated early- from end-stage OA. Additionally, they developed an m7G scoring system that correlated with variations in the immune microenvironment, suggesting a functional role for m7G methylation in OA pathogenesis [128]. In two other in silico studies, NUDT11, NUDT1, SNUPN, METTL1, EIF4E2, and CYFIP1 m7G-related hub genes were identified as biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prognosis of OA, which may be associated with immune cell infiltration and inflamed phenotypes [129,130]. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that METTL1 and m7G levels are markedly elevated in OA chondrocytes. This increase upregulates mitochondrial transfer RNA (mt-tRF3b-LeuTAA) expression, which in turn decreases SENP1 levels and increases SIRT3 SUMOylation, eventually inhibiting PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitochondrial mitophagy. The disruption in mitochondrial function contributes to cartilage degradation, and using a PMC-tRF3b-LeuTAA inhibitor in vivo attenuates cartilage damage in a mouse model [127]. These findings suggest that targeting the METTL1/m7G/mt-tRF3b-LeuTAA axis could be a promising strategy for OA treatment.",
        "Pseudouridylation is a post-transcriptional RNA modification in which uridine (U) is converted to pseudouridine (Ψ) through the activity of pseudouridine synthases (PUSs). These enzymes can function independently or in combination with small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) that guide site-specific modifications. Similar to other modifications, pseudouridylation occurs in all types of RNAs, including mRNAs, rRNAs, tRNAs, and snRNAs [131]. Pseudouridylation plays various physiological roles depending on the RNA it modifies, but it is most commonly associated with the regulation of gene expression. The incorporation of Ψ into RNA increases the rigidity of the phosphodiester backbone, which in turn affects the molecule’s thermodynamic stability and spatial conformation, leading to enhanced stability, particularly in shorter RNA species [132]. A recent study indicates that OA alters specific pseudouridylation sites in ribosomal RNA. Specifically, the reduction of SNORA33 decreased modification at the 28S-ψ4966 site, which influences ribosome function and the cellular proteome [133].",
        "2’-O-ribose methylation is a chemical modification that involves adding a methyl group to the 2’-hydroxyl group of the ribose sugar in RNA. This modification is commonly found in rRNAs and tRNAs and plays a key role in stabilizing RNA structure, promoting proper folding, and enhancing RNA function [134]. It has been found that rRNA modifications, especially 2’-O-methylation (2’-O-Me), are altered in chondrocytes exposed to OA synovial fluids. Specifically, reduced 2’-O-Me at the U14 site in 5.8S rRNA, which was mediated by SNORD71 knockdown, led to changes in ribosome function and increased type I collagen production [135]. These findings suggest that altered 2’-O-Me plays a role in OA progression by affecting the translation of key ECM proteins.",
        "Polyadenylation involves the addition of adenosine nucleotides, known as the poly(A) tail, to the 3′ end of most eukaryotic mRNA molecules [136]. Although this co-/post-transcriptional process is not typically considered an epitranscriptomic modification since it regulates the stability and functionality of mRNA. Two separate studies reported that polyadenylation site alterations are not prevalent in OA cartilage [137,138]. Yet, treatment with cordycepin (3′ deoxyadenosine), a polyadenylation inhibitor, was found to reduce Runx2, MMP-3/-13, and ADAMTS-4 levels, leading to attenuated inflammation, ECM degeneration, and pain in rodent models of OA [139]. The role of alternative polyadenylation in OA was investigated using QuantSeq Rev. While differential gene expression confirmed OA-related biological processes, only 20 transcripts showed significant changes in polyadenylation, primarily affecting the length of the 3′ UTR and the stability of mRNA, particularly in transcripts of the oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) gene, which is involved in cartilage degradation and inflammation [138]. Table 3 provides an overview of m5C, m7G, 2′-O-methylation, and Ψ RNA modifications.",
        "OA currently lacks an effective cure, and most available medications primarily aim to relieve pain and manage symptoms. Emerging strategies such as epigenetic modulation, tissue-engineered cartilage implants, MSC therapy, and targeted intra-articular biologic drugs offer an innovative and promising approach for the treatment of OA [140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147]. RNA-targeted therapies are a rapidly growing and promising area of research and therapeutic development.",
        "As mentioned before, M6A is the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic mRNA, and increasing evidence indicates that it plays important roles in various cellular processes involved in the pathogenesis of OA, including ECM degradation, regulation of inflammatory responses, senescence, ferroptosis, and autophagy. On the other hand, numerous studies reported aberrant expression of enzymes that catalyze, recognize, or remove m6A [28,48,51]. Therefore, m6A modifications and m6A-related enzymes may constitute novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of OA. For instance, silencing of METTL3 and inhibition of m6A were shown to be protective in collagenase-induced OA in mice [76]. In another study, overexpression of FTO attenuated OA in a rat model of MIA-induced OA [104]. Importantly, some natural products used in the management of OA were reported to induce their beneficial effects via modulation of m6A methylation. For example, Bushen Huoxue Decoction (BSHXD), a traditional Chinese medicine used to relieve OA symptoms, prevents LPS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis by reducing m6A modification in cultured chondrocytes [148]. Triptolide (TP), another bioactive compound extracted from the herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, with anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic properties. Treatment with TP reduced IGF2BP3 expression in vitro and showed a strong binding affinity in molecular docking, suggesting that TP may exert its effects by targeting m6A-related post-transcriptional regulation [149]. Finally, Gubi decoction (GBD), a traditional herbal medicine known for its virtues in the management of OA, was protective in DMM-induced OA in mice via promoting chondrocyte autophagy and suppressing METTL3-dependent ATG7 m6A methylation [150].",
        "Together, these data suggest that m6A modification can serve as a potential target in OA. Further studies are needed to fully understand the therapeutic potential of targeting m6A modification in OA.",
        "In conclusion, emerging evidence indicates that epitranscriptomic modifications profoundly contribute to the pathogenesis of OA by modulating key cellular and molecular processes. These modifications, including m6A, m5C, m7G, Ψ, and 2′-O methylation, have been shown to affect all types of RNA, such as mRNA and non-coding RNA, by influencing their structure, stability, localization, and function. The altered expression of RNA-modifying enzymes, such as METTL3, YTHDF2, and ALKBH1, influences chondrocyte homeostasis, inflammatory signaling, ECM integrity, programmed cell death (ferroptosis and pyroptosis), cellular senescence, and autophagy. For instance, dysregulated m6A methylation mediated by the METTL3/METTL14 complex and removed by FTO and ALKBH5, reduces the stability and translation of key transcripts such as SOX9, STAT1, RUNX2, and GPX4, thereby promoting cartilage degradation and synovial inflammation. Similarly, altered m5C and m7G modifications affect collagen remodeling and mitochondrial function, while alterations in pseudouridylation and 2′-O methylation impact ribosomal accuracy and ECM protein synthesis. Targeting the epitranscriptomic machinery offers potential for attenuating or reversing disease progression. Small-molecule inhibitors and PROTACs targeting methyltransferases (e.g., METTL3, METTL14) and demethylases (e.g., FTO, ALKBH5), along with oligonucleotide-based methods to modulate RNA–reader interactions, have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models of OA. Future research will need to focus on uncovering the mechanistic details of RNA modifications in different cell types and contexts, particularly between healthy and osteoarthritic joints. Integrating multi-omics and single-cell epitranscriptomic profiling will identify new targets and optimize therapeutic approaches.",

Due to easy application and inexpensive cost, topical treatment is the optimal approach for CL. It could be used alone or with systemic treatments. Electrospun fibers as drug release systems in treating skin lesions have various advantages such as adjustable drug release rate, maintaining appropriate humidity and temperature, gas exchange, plasticity at the lesion site, similarity with the skin extracellular matrix (ECM) and drug delivery with high efficiency. Hydrogels are valuable scaffolds in the treatment of skin lesions. The important features of hydrogels include preserving unstable drugs from degradation, absorption of wound secretions, high biocompatibility, improving the re-epithelialization of the wound and preventing the formation of scars. One of the issues in local drug delivery systems for the skin is the low permeability of drugs in the skin. Polymeric scaffolds that are designed as microneedle patches can penetrate the skin and overcome this challenge. Also, drug delivery using nanocarriers increases the effectiveness of drugs in lower and more tolerable doses and reduces the toxicity of drugs. The application of cell therapy in the treatment of parasitic and infectious diseases has been widely investigated. The complexity of leishmaniasis treatment requires identifying new treatment options like cell therapy to overcome the disease. Topics investigated in this study include drug delivery systems based on tissue engineering scaffolds, nanotechnology and cell therapy-based studies to reduce the complications of CL.

        "Leishmania species are the etiological agents of leishmaniasis, a globally prevalent parasitic disease transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies [1]. These protozoan parasites replicate intracellularly in vertebrate hosts, particularly within macrophages (MQs) and dendritic cells (DCs), ultimately leading to host cell lysis and lesion development. The clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis are broadly classified into three forms based on parasite species, geographic distribution, and host immune response: cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) [1, 2, 3]. CL is the most common form, affecting an estimated 0.7 to 1.2 million individuals annually across more than 100 countries, especially in the Mediterranean Basin, North Africa, and South America [2, 4, 5]. Although CL is typically non‐lethal, it poses significant public health concerns due to persistent lesions, stigma, and challenges in controlling both the parasite reservoir and sandfly vectors [1, 6, 7]. Healing from CL—commonly caused by Leishmania major and \nL. tropica\n—can span months to years, varying between rural and urban settings [1, 5]. Current treatments, including pentavalent antimonials, often involve prolonged regimens and serious adverse effects, highlighting the urgent need for safer and more effective therapeutic alternatives, including immunomodulatory approaches [6, 7].",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent, non‐haematopoietic, fibroblast‐like stem cells with self‐renewing capacity and the ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types. Although bone marrow and adipose tissue are the primary MSC sources, they can also be derived from embryonic tissues, dental pulp, thymus, tendons, muscles, synovium, cartilage, blood, and spleen [8]. MSCs have demonstrated therapeutic potential in various pathological conditions due to their anti‐inflammatory properties, ability to stimulate angiogenesis, cytokine production, and targeted migration to sites of tissue damage. These features have supported their application in the treatment of immune‐related disorders (e.g., diabetes), trauma, ischaemic injuries, multiple sclerosis, wound healing, and congenital anomalies [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Additionally, MSCs can secrete antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which contribute to infection control in conditions such as sepsis and cystic fibrosis [17]. As illustrated in Figure 1, MSCs play a pivotal role in wound healing by differentiating into specialised cells, secreting growth factors, and modulating the microenvironment to promote tissue repair and regeneration.",
        "Schematic representation of the role of MSCs in wound healing. The illustration outlines the key phases of wound healing and highlights the mechanisms through which MSCs contribute to tissue regeneration, including their differentiation into specialised cell types and the secretion of cytokines and growth factors that promote repair, angiogenesis, and immune modulation (Created with https://www.biorender.com/).

        "Recently, the therapeutic and immunomodulatory roles of MSCs in parasitic infections have gained increasing attention. For instance, adipose‐derived MSCs (Ad‐MSCs) have been shown to modulate immune responses in murine models of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, reducing myocardial damage in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy [18, 19]. Emerging evidence also highlights the interaction between \nL. major\n and MSCs. A recent study demonstrated that MSCs can phagocytise \nL. major\n and upregulate Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) 4 and 6. This interaction led to a significant increase in pro‐inflammatory cytokine production, a reduction in transforming growth factor‐β levels, and increased production of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, \nL. major\n exposure reduces the immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs by downregulating key cluster differentiation (CD) markers, including CD29 and CD73 [20].",
        "Given the growing interest in MSC‐based therapies, several studies have explored their modulatory effects on Leishmania infections in both in vitro and in vivo models. This review aims to evaluate the effects of MSCs on Leishmania parasites and lesion progression, summarize the underlying mechanisms of MSC‐mediated healing in leishmaniasis, and highlight future research directions in this emerging therapeutic field.",
        "A comprehensive literature search was conducted, with no time restrictions, and concluded on May 31, 2024. We included all studies that evaluated the therapeutic and/or immunomodulatory effects of MSCs on Leishmania either in vitro (cultures) or in vivo (cutaneous lesions in laboratory animal models). The search strategy employed combinations of the following keywords: “Leishmania,” “cutaneous leishmaniasis,” “mesenchymal stem cells,” “MSCs,” “wound healing,” and “therapeutic effect,” using Boolean operators (AND/OR) to refine results. Searches were performed across four major databases: Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Only full‐text articles that were accessible were included for further analysis. In cases of discrepancies regarding article inclusion or data interpretation, consensus was reached through discussion with the lead investigators (MF and HE).

        "The earliest study assessing the therapeutic and immunomodulatory effects of AD‐MSCs on MQs in \nL. major\n infection was published in 2016 [22]. Most studies focused on \nL. major\n, a primary causative agent of CL, while the Brazilian studies utilised L. amazonensis. MSCs were sourced from various tissues, including Wharton's jelly, umbilical cord, bone marrow, and adipose tissue. Interestingly, one Turkish study explored the combined use of aloe emodin and MSC‐derived exosomes as a novel therapeutic strategy.",
        "Current antileishmanial therapies are associated with significant limitations, including high toxicity, prolonged treatment durations, and severe side effects [7, 32]. These factors often lead to poor patient compliance and therapeutic failure. Moreover, treatment efficacy varies amongst Leishmania species and may not result in complete parasite clearance [33, 34]. Consequently, researchers are exploring innovative approaches such as combination therapies and immunomodulation to improve outcomes while reducing side effects [32, 35].",
        "MSC‐based therapy has shown promise in managing various inflammatory, infectious, and autoimmune conditions [16, 36]. MSCs exert therapeutic effects by modulating immune responses, regulating the inflammatory microenvironment, promoting angiogenesis, secreting growth factors, and differentiating into multiple cell types involved in tissue repair and restoring damaged tissues [37, 38, 39]. In parasitic infections, MSCs may reduce inflammation and parasitemia through attenuation of inflammatory responses and promotion of tissue regeneration [18, 19, 40, 41, 42]. These mechanisms are particularly relevant in CL, where immunopathology plays a critical role in disease progression.",
        "Several studies have shown that MSCs modulate MQ function by altering cytokine profiles. For example, MSCs derived from BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice decreased TNF‐α and IL‐10 levels, increasing the TNF‐α/IL‐10 ratio and promoting M1 polarisation [22]. AD‐MSCs from C57BL/6 mice were shown to reduce IL‐6 and nitric oxide (NO) while increasing IL‐10 and TNF‐α, thereby promoting an anti‐inflammatory phenotype at infection sites. These effects may enhance MQ‐mediated parasite clearance and stimulate regulatory T cell development, ultimately mitigating immunopathological damage in \nL. major\n infections [21].",
        "Multiple studies evaluated MSC‐based therapies in \nL. major\n‐infected BALB/c mice. Intravenous administration of AD‐MSCs enhanced Th1 immune responses and limited parasite dissemination. Treated mice exhibited increased NO production in splenocytes upon stimulation and a higher CD8+/CD4+ T cell ratio, indicating enhanced cytotoxic and MQ activity [28]. Intralesional MSC injections significantly reduced lesion size and parasite load [25]. Bahrami et al. (2021) found that AD‐MSCs, alone or in combination with Glucantime, promoted Th1 responses (increased IL‐12 and TNF‐α) and suppressed Th2 responses (reduced IL‐10 and FOXP3 expression), potentially mitigating Treg‐mediated immune suppression. Interestingly, co‐administration with Glucantime did not significantly improve therapeutic outcomes over AD‐MSCs alone, suggesting possible redundancy or interaction effects [27].",
        "The therapeutic effectiveness of MSCs appears to vary with the source of MSCs and Leishmania species. In L. amazonensis infections, a combination of AD‐MSCs and meglumine antimoniate reduced parasite burden and inflammation [29]. Conversely, bone marrow‐derived MSCs (BM‐MSCs) had a limited effect on lesion progression in similar models [23]. However, treatment with AD‐MSC‐derived secretome in \nL. major\n infections significantly reduced lesion size, decreased IL‐10, and increased IL‐12 levels, suggesting the potential of cell‐free MSC products as alternative therapies [30].",
        "Despite promising preclinical data, several limitations challenge the clinical translation of MSC therapy. Systemically administered MSCs may be trapped in pulmonary capillaries, raising concerns about embolism and off‐target effects [43]. The mechanisms governing MSC clearance from circulation remain poorly understood. Moreover, concerns have been raised about the potential of MSCs to influence the tumour microenvironment, potentially contributing to drug resistance in cancer therapy [44, 45].",
        "Ethical and regulatory issues also merit attention. Cell sourcing—especially from perinatal tissues like Wharton's jelly or umbilical cord—requires strict donor consent and privacy safeguards. Regulatory frameworks for stem cell therapies vary globally, leading to inconsistencies in clinical standards, safety protocols, and oversight. The growing commercialisation of MSC‐based products further complicates ethical considerations, particularly when commercial interests outpace scientific validation.",
        "Future research should prioritise optimising MSC delivery methods, elucidating their immunomodulatory mechanisms, and identifying reliable biomarkers of safety and efficacy. Comparative studies across different MSC sources and Leishmania species are essential to refine treatment protocols. Additionally, conducting longitudinal studies will be essential for understanding the long‐term effects of MSC therapy. Importantly, addressing ethical and regulatory challenges through transparent, multidisciplinary collaboration will be vital for the responsible advancement of MSC‐based therapies for leishmaniasis.",
        "MSCs hold significant promise as an innovative therapeutic strategy for CL, offering a multifaceted approach that combines immunomodulation, anti‐inflammatory effect, and tissue regeneration. This review consolidates preclinical evidence demonstrating that MSCs—particularly AD‐MSCs—can reduce lesion size, rebalance dysregulated cytokine responses, enhance MQ function, and promote healing in Leishmania‐infected models. However, therapeutic outcomes are markedly influenced by factors such as MSC origin, Leishmania species, route of administration, and combinatory regimens with existing drugs. The observed variability underscores the urgent need for standardised experimental protocols and deeper mechanistic elucidation of MSC‐host–parasite interactions. Advancing MSC‐based therapies toward clinical application will require comprehensive safety profiling, optimisation of delivery systems, and rigorously designed clinical trials. If these challenges are addressed, MSCs could become a transformative adjunct—or even a viable alternative—to conventional therapies in the fight against CL.",

Finally, we address remaining technical challenges and propose future research directions aimed at clinical translation.",
        "The cornea, the transparent anterior portion of the eye, plays a dual role in ensuring optical clarity and providing a protective barrier to environmental threats [1]. Its curvature and avascular nature contribute to approximately 70% of the eye’s total refractive power, enabling sharp image focus on the retina [2]. This optical performance is largely attributed to the cornea’s organized stromal structure and dehydrated state, maintained by endothelial ion transport [2].",
        "Beyond optics, the cornea functions as an immunological and physical shield, actively protecting the intraocular structures from a myriad of environmental insults. These include harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a wide spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi), airborne particulate matter, and chemical irritants [3]. The cornea’s multilayered structure is exquisitely adapted for these functions, comprising five distinct layers—the superficial epithelium, Bowman’s layer, the thick central stroma, Descemet’s membrane, and the innermost endothelium—each contributing to clarity and protection [1,2]. Among these layers, the corneal epithelium, as the outermost layer, is the first line of defense and holds a remarkable capacity for regeneration in response to injury [4].",
        "However, despite its inherent regenerative capabilities, the corneal epithelium remains acutely vulnerable to a range of insults. These include acute trauma, chemical and thermal burns, pervasive infections (bacterial keratitis, herpetic keratitis), autoimmune disorders (e.g., ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, Stevens–Johnson syndrome), and various genetic conditions (e.g., aniridia-associated keratopathy) [5]. When an injury involves the limbal region—where the corneal stem cells reside—the native regenerative capacity of the epithelium may be severely compromised or even destroyed. This leads to a debilitating condition known as limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) [4,6]. LSCD includes conjunctivalization (the aberrant invasion of conjunctival goblet cells and vascular tissue onto the typically avascular cornea), neovascularization (ingrowth of blood vessels), and chronic, non-healing epithelial defects. Clinically, LSCD manifests as profound pain, severe photophobia, recurrent infections, and ultimately significant and often irreversible vision loss [6].",
        "While corneal transplantation (penetrating keratoplasty) remains the current gold-standard treatment for severe corneal injury and opacification, its broader implementation and long-term success are significantly hampered by two limitations: (1) donor tissue shortage and (2) allograft rejection [7,8]. LSCD is untreatable with penetrating keratoplasty, as the epithelial layer post-penetrating keratoplasty comes from the recipients’ own limbal stem cells. While limbal stem cell grafts can be performed, they are much more likely to suffer allograft rejection, as the limbus is vascularized while the rest of the cornea is not. These challenges underscore the urgent and unmet clinical need for novel regenerative strategies that are capable of effectively restoring corneal epithelial barrier function, achieving durable transparency, and ideally obviating the reliance on limited donor tissue and chronic systemic immunosuppression [4].",
        "Stem cell-derived corneal epithelium has emerged as a highly promising and transformative alternative [9,10,11]. A diverse array of stem cell types, including resident limbal stem cells (LSCs), multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), ethically sensitive but highly pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [12,13,14,15], possess the remarkable capacity to generate stratified epithelial sheets in vitro [4,9,16]. When appropriately differentiated and engineered, these constructs can robustly recapitulate the native barrier function of the limbus region of the cornea and actively promote healing of the ocular surface [17,18,19]. Beyond their direct therapeutic applications in tissue repair, these precisely engineered epithelial constructs also offer invaluable in vitro platforms for pharmacotoxicity screening of novel ophthalmic drugs and for developing sophisticated disease models that enable a deeper understanding of corneal pathologies at the cellular and molecular levels.",
        "This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in stem cell-derived corneal epithelia. We will specifically focus on the cutting-edge engineering strategies employed for their generation, the rigorous methods used for functional evaluation of their barrier properties, and the crucial translational progress that is bringing these therapies closer to the clinic. Furthermore, we will summarize recent advances in stem cell sourcing, optimized differentiation protocols, and advanced tissue engineering approaches while concurrently identifying key challenges that still need to be overcome and outlining future opportunities for successful clinical application.",
        "Limbal stem cell (LSC) transplantation is a cornerstone in the surgical management of limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), a debilitating ocular surface disorder characterized by chronic pain, inflammation, and vision loss. The primary objective is to restore a stable, transparent corneal epithelium by replenishing functional LSCs. The choice of transplantation technique is guided by the laterality (unilateral vs. bilateral) and severity (partial vs. total) of LSCD (Table 1).",
        "In unilateral LSCD, the contralateral healthy eye can serve as an autologous donor, mitigating risks of immune rejection and obviating the need for systemic immunosuppression [20,21]. Conjunctival limbal autograft (CLAU) involves harvesting 2–4 clock hours of limbal tissue with adjacent conjunctiva from the healthy eye, followed by direct transplantation to the affected eye post-pannus removal [20,21]. CLAU is a single-stage procedure with long-term safety and efficacy, although there is a risk of iatrogenic LSCD in the donor eye due to substantial tissue harvest. Anatomical success rates up to 83.2% have been reported [21]. To address the concerns regarding donor morbidity and limited tissue quantity, cultivated autologous limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET) uses a much smaller limbal biopsy (1–2 mm2) from the healthy eye, which is expanded ex vivo on a biological substrate such as denuded human amniotic membrane under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions [16,20]. Once a confluent epithelial sheet has formed, it is transplanted onto the recipient cornea. CLET minimizes donor tissue harvesting, allows for quality control of proliferative cells, and has reported success rates ranging from 60% to 80% for restoring a stable, avascular corneal surface [16,20]. However, CLET is a two-stage procedure requiring specialized cell culture facilities, increasing complexity and cost compared to direct grafting [20,23]. A newer single-stage alternative, simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET), combines the minimal donor tissue requirement of CLET with the simplicity of CLAU. SLET involves harvesting a small limbal biopsy (2–3 mm2) from the healthy eye, mincing it into tiny explants, and placing them directly onto the periphery of the de-epithelialized recipient cornea, often secured with fibrin glue and covered with an amniotic membrane. SLET has gained popularity due to its cost-effectiveness, reduced donor morbidity, and reported success rates of 75.2% to 83.8% at one year [20,23,24] (Table 1).",
        "In bilateral LSCD, autologous sources are unavailable, necessitating the use of allogeneic (donor-derived) LSCs, which introduces challenges of allograft rejection and the need for systemic immunosuppression [7,15,23]. Keratolimbal allograft (KLAL) and living-related conjunctival limbal allograft (lr-CLAL) involve transplantation of limbal tissue from a cadaveric donor or living relative [20,21]. While these procedures provide LSCs in the absence of autologous options, they require lifelong systemic immunosuppression, leading to significant systemic side effects and high risk of immune rejection [7,23,25]. KLAL graft survival rates have been reported at 67% at 12 months and 53% at 18 months [16]. Allogeneic cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation is similar to autologous CLET, but uses donor-derived LSCs cultured ex vivo [21,23]. This cultured donor epithelium is potentially less immunogenic than full tissue grafts, but still requires immunosuppression and may suffer from limited long-term survival of transplanted cells, with some studies reporting anatomical success rates of 61.4% and functional success rates of 53% [23,24] (Table 1).",
        "Several clinical considerations are critical for successful LSC transplantation. Meticulous preoperative optimization of the ocular surface is essential and includes control of inflammation, management of dry eye, correction of eyelid abnormalities, and resolution of cicatricial complications [15,20,23]. Confirmation of LSCD through impression cytology to detect goblet cells on the cornea is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment [10,15]. Persistent inflammation poses a significant threat to LSC survival and function; thus, effective anti-inflammatory strategies are vital before, during, and after surgery. Long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor for graft stability, recurrence of LSCD, and complications such as glaucoma (particularly with corticosteroid use), infection, or progressive corneal or conjunctival scarring [7,20,26]. The absence of unequivocal markers for LSCs complicates diagnosis and assessment of transplanted cell “stemness,” highlighting the need for ongoing research into reliable LSC biomarkers. For ex vivo expanded cell therapies such as CLET, strict good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant manufacturing and quality control protocols are essential to ensure cell viability, purity, and safety [16,22].",
        "In summary, LSC implantation has transformed the treatment landscape for LSCD. Autologous approaches, particularly CLAU, CLET, and SLET, offer the most promising and durable outcomes for unilateral LSCD. In bilateral cases, allogeneic transplantation remains the mainstay, despite the burden of lifelong immunosuppression and higher failure rates. These challenges underscore the need for continued research into novel regenerative solutions and immune-evasive therapies for LSCD [9,20,23,25].",
        "Despite its widespread use as a sight-restoring procedure, conventional corneal transplantation (penetrating keratoplasty) faces significant limitations, particularly in cases involving corneal scarring, primary epithelial dysfunction, or severe limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). These challenges underscore the pressing need for innovative regenerative strategies [7,20,23].",
        "Relatively few limbal stem cell grafts are being performed in the United States and worldwide. This is not because there is not a need, but rather because of the greater difficulty of LSC graft versus full thickness and endothelial keratoplasty. As methods of limbal stem cell grafting become more available, these procedures will be potentially subject to the same tissue availability issues as other corneal transplants. A major and persistent hindrance to widespread corneal transplantation is the global shortage of suitable donor corneas [27,28]. This tissue scarcity means that many patients in need of transplantation face long waiting lists, potentially leading to irreversible tissue damage or vision loss. Exacerbating this chronic issue, events such as the COVID-19 pandemic have profoundly impacted tissue procurement and distribution, leading to drastic declines in available donor corneas—by as much as 68% in some regions during peak pandemic periods [20,29]. This critical scarcity has intensely catalyzed research into alternative solutions aimed at circumventing the reliance on limited donor tissue. Such innovative approaches include the robotic fabrication of epithelial sheets, which offers potential for automated, high-throughput production, and the development of low-density cell cultures derived from minimal donor tissue, maximizing the yield from each available donor [14,16]. Notably, groundbreaking research has demonstrated the ability to engineer stratified epithelial sheets from even a single adult murine limbal progenitor cell [16], presenting a high-yield strategy that could revolutionize tissue engineering and dramatically increase the availability of transplantable tissue.",
        "Corneal graft rejection remains a critical and frequently encountered challenge following transplantation, representing a leading cause of graft failure. This risk is particularly pronounced in high-risk patients (e.g., those with prior graft failures, extensive corneal vascularization, or severe ocular surface inflammation), where the failure rates due to rejection can tragically reach as high as 35–70% [7,20,30]. Rejection is particularly an issue for limbal stem cell grafts, as the limbus is vascularized and lacks the immune privilege that the rest of the cornea is equipped with. Rejections can manifest from distinct immunological outcomes affecting different layers of the cornea, including epithelial rejection lines, characterized by a line of lymphocytes migrating across the epithelium; endothelial rejection lines, often visible as a “Khodadoust line” of inflammatory cells on the posterior corneal surface; and a more diffuse stromal rejection band, indicative of deeper inflammation and commonly seen in penetrating keratoplasties [7,31,32]. Accompanying anterior chamber reactions, marked by intraocular inflammation, and severe corneal edema resulting from endothelial dysfunction can ultimately lead to opacification of the previously clear graft and significant vision loss.",
        "To mitigate rejection, corticosteroids are commonly prescribed as systemic or topical immunosuppressants. However, long-term use of corticosteroids carries significant risks [7,26], including elevated intraocular pressure (leading to glaucoma), cataract formation, and increased susceptibility to infections, thereby introducing secondary complications that can further jeopardize visual outcomes. To address these profound risks, alternative strategies are continuously emerging. These include the development of biomaterial-free cell sheets, which minimize foreign material exposure, and the exploration of anti-inflammatory agents such as IL-1 receptor antagonists, which can locally suppress immune activation and promote endogenous stem cell expansion, potentially leading to a more tolerant ocular surface [33,34,35]. Importantly, successful ocular surface reconstruction depends not only on the regeneration of the epithelial layer but also on the functional integrity of the underlying corneal stroma and endothelium. The epithelium cannot sustain itself in isolation: it relies on biochemical and structural support from the stromal matrix and the hydration-regulating function of the endothelium to maintain transparency and stability. Therefore, effective biointegration of the epithelial graft or carrier with the host stroma is critical to ensure epithelial cell survival, differentiation, and long-term tissue homeostasis [36,37].",
        "Together, these inherent challenges of donor tissue scarcity and the persistent threat of immune rejection underscore the urgent and compelling need for regenerative strategies capable of durably restoring corneal integrity while simultaneously reducing the reliance on limited donor tissue and eliminating the necessity for lifelong systemic immunosuppression.",
        "Autologous stem cell-derived corneal epithelium offers a compelling array of advantages over conventional transplantation approaches, which often rely on donor cadaveric tissue [13,14,29]. These significant benefits largely stem from the inherent regenerative potential of stem cells, their reduced immunogenicity in an autologous setting, and the unprecedented capacity for precise customization through advanced tissue engineering techniques [16,29,33].",
        "A fundamental advantage of stem cells is their inherent ability for self-renewal, allowing for the theoretical generation of a virtually unlimited supply of patient-specific corneal epithelial cells [16,38]. This addresses the critical issue of donor tissue scarcity, which is a major bottleneck in conventional corneal transplantation [23]. Limbal stem cells (LSCs), physiologically residing at the limbus (the crucial junction between the cornea and conjunctiva), are the primary source responsible for maintaining corneal epithelial homeostasis and repair throughout life [16,39]. In cases of limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), where this resident population is compromised, restoring epithelial integrity becomes challenging [7]. However, when LSCs are expanded ex vivo from a small biopsy or when pluripotent stem cells, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or embryonic stem cells (ESCs), are guided to differentiate into corneal epithelial cells, an abundant and renewable source becomes available [13,14,29]. This unlimited supply ensures that multiple applications or follow-up procedures are feasible without relying on external donors, revolutionizing the scalability of treatment [16]. Nevertheless, the process of inducing LSCs from various autologous sources can be arduous and time-consuming [40].",
        "Stem cells possess the remarkable plasticity to be guided to differentiate into stratified, cornea-specific epithelial cells through tightly regulated and optimized in vitro protocols. This controlled differentiation process leverages our understanding of corneal development [13,16]. Key transcription factors, such as p63, Pax6, and KLF4, play orchestrating roles in managing lineage commitment and the establishment of the corneal epithelial phenotype [16,41]. As cells mature, specific cytokeratins (e.g., cytokeratin 3 (K3) and cytokeratin 12 (K12)) serve as definitive markers of mature, differentiated corneal epithelium, confirming successful lineage specification [17,42]. By meticulously fine-tuning culture conditions, including the precise composition of growth factors, cytokines, and small molecules in the media, as well as the mechanical and biochemical properties of the substrate (e.g., stiffness, surface coatings), these stem cells can be engineered to accurately replicate the native tissue’s complex cellular architecture, vital optical transparency, and crucial barrier functions [13,43,44]. This directed differentiation ensures the generation of functionally competent tissue rather than just a simple sheet of cells.",
        "Perhaps one of the most compelling advantages of using autologous stem cell-derived epithelium is the near elimination of immunogenicity and the associated risk of immune rejection. Unlike allogeneic (donor-derived) grafts, which inherently express foreign major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and other surface molecules that trigger a robust host immune response, autologous cells are recognized as “self.” This bypasses the need for chronic systemic immunosuppression, a critical benefit as long-term immunosuppression carries significant risks of opportunistic infections, nephrotoxicity, and malignancy [7,9,18,33,34]. While some stem cell types, like mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), possess intrinsic immunomodulatory properties that can dampen immune responses, the differentiated cells derived from allogeneic stem cells will inevitably express MHC antigens and other surface molecules that can elicit an immune response [33,34]. Therefore, autologous applications fundamentally provide the most reliable and safest strategy for achieving long-term engraftment and avoiding immune-mediated graft failure [13,14,35]. This dramatically improves patient safety and quality of life post-transplantation.",
        "The integration of stem cell biology with advanced tissue engineering principles allows for unprecedented customization of corneal substitutes [16,43]. Biomaterial-based scaffolds, which serve as the structural framework for the engineered tissue, can be precisely designed and seeded with stem cell-derived epithelium [19,44]. These scaffolds can be tailored for specific attributes, including their mechanical strength (to withstand eye movements and surgical handling), optical transparency (crucial for vision), and their ability to integrate seamlessly with the host corneal tissue [43,45]. The profound ability to control the cellular microenvironment (e.g., oxygen tension, nutrient delivery) and meticulously tailor biomaterial properties (e.g., porosity, degradation rate, biochemical cues) offers a significant advantage over the fixed properties of donor corneas [13,14]. Moreover, differentiation strategies used to prepare the epithelial layer can significantly influence functional outcomes, including tight junction formation and barrier integrity. Studies have shown that improved differentiation protocols lead to higher TEER values, as demonstrated in a microfluidic co-culture cornea-on-a-chip model where TEER exceeded 650 Ω·cm2, and increased expression of tight junction proteins, suggesting closer mimicry of native corneal epithelium [46]. Similarly, scaffold material properties such as pore size, stiffness, and surface chemistry have been shown to directly impact epithelial cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation—factors critical for robust barrier function. These outcomes are often quantified through TEER and permeability assays, and several scaffold-based studies have reported such metrics to validate physiological relevance [47,48,49]. By directing stem cell differentiation, proliferation, and their organized spatial arrangement on these scaffolds, corneal substitutes can potentially be engineered with superior optical clarity, enhanced biomechanical integrity, and optimized functional integration with host tissues, leading to potentially better visual outcomes than traditional grafts [29,50].",
        "Beyond their ability to differentiate and form a structural barrier, stem cells exert significant trophic effects on the surrounding tissue [34,35]. This involves the secretion of a rich array of bioactive molecules, including various growth factors (e.g., HGF, KGF, EGF), cytokines (e.g., IL-10, TGF-β), chemokines, and extracellular matrix components (e.g., collagen, fibronectin) [18,51]. These secreted factors collectively modulate inflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α), thereby creating a more favorable microenvironment for healing [33,52]. They also actively promote epithelial repair by stimulating endogenous cell proliferation and migration, and notably support neural regeneration [34,53] (Figure 1). This neurotrophic support is vital for restoring corneal sensation, which is critical for reflex tearing and protecting the ocular surface [28,50]. Furthermore, these secreted factors contribute to overall corneal surface stability and the maintenance of a healthy tear film, both essential for long-term graft success and patient comfort. This paracrine signaling capability of stem cells adds an invaluable dimension to their therapeutic potential, going beyond simple tissue replacement [18,52].",
        "Significant advancements have been made in stem cell-based corneal reconstruction, with progress spanning multiple stem cell sources, differentiation techniques, and scaffold innovations [14,29,43].",
        "Various stem cell types have been explored for their regenerative potential in corneal repair (Table 2). These include embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), limbal stem cells (LSCs), and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) [13,14,40,53]. ESCs have demonstrated robust differentiation into corneal epithelial phenotypes, especially when cultured on acellular porcine corneal matrices [42,54]. iPSCs offer personalized, expandable sources, and have been used to create 3D corneal organoids [55]. MSCs, derived from umbilical cord blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, show homing ability and therapeutic efficacy in injured corneal tissues [18,56]. Other sources, such as umbilical cord lining stem cells and oral mucosal epithelial cells, have shown promise for long-term integration and epithelial repair [51,56] (Figure 2, Table 2).",
        "Protocols have been standardized for differentiating stem cells into corneal epithelial cells (CECs) and limbal stem cells (LSCs) with proper morphology and functional characteristics. These protocols leverage key growth factors, extracellular matrices, and feeder cell systems [16,42,43]. For instance, Springer Protocols provides a standardized method for generating corneal epithelium from cultures of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and corneal epithelial cells derived from both human and rabbit sources [32]. Human basal limbal epithelial cells have been isolated using BCAM-positive sorting techniques, enabling reproducible epithelial sheet fabrication [40]. Advances include feeder-free, oxygen-controlled culture methods and the use of limbal stem cell-conditioned media to induce limbal-like phenotypes from hESCs on porcine scaffolds [24,41,48,54] (Table 3).",
        "Generating a functional, stratified corneal epithelium is crucial for restoring visual clarity [14]. LSCs, CESCs, iPSCs, MSCs, and ESCs have all been investigated for this potential [40,51,53,55]. While ex vivo LSC expansion shows clinical promise, issues such as phenotype maintenance and donor availability remain. iPSCs and ESCs provide scalable alternatives, but pose risks of teratoma formation and immunogenicity [58,63]. Successful stratification also depends on a scaffold choice (e.g., amniotic membranes, collagen gels, and decellularized stroma) and the presence of key growth factors to drive differentiation [21,43,44,64].",
        "Together, these innovations in stem cell sourcing, differentiation, and epithelium engineering have advanced the field toward viable clinical applications in corneal repair and regeneration/replacement [18,52].",
        "A critical and paramount goal in engineering stem cell-derived corneal epithelium is to ensure its functional integrity precisely mimics the native corneal barrier. This barrier is indispensable for maintaining corneal transparency, hydration, and protecting the inner ocular structures from external insults. To rigorously assess the physiological competence and barrier performance of regenerated tissue, several well-defined parameters are employed, each contributing a distinct and crucial insight (Figure 3). Importantly, these functional metrics are directly influenced by the scaffold material properties and stem cell differentiation protocols discussed earlier, emphasizing the interconnectedness of design choices and biological outcomes.",
        "Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) is a widely recognized and quantitative electrophysiological measurement that assesses the integrity of tight junctions within an epithelial cell monolayer [47,65]. It directly quantifies the ionic resistance across the epithelial layer, making it a primary and highly sensitive indicator of barrier tightness [66]. Higher TEER values are indicative of stronger tight junction integrity, meaning a more robust seal between adjacent cells and consequently significantly reduced paracellular permeability [31,67]. This tight sealing is essential for maintaining the precise hydration balance of the cornea, preventing excessive fluid influx or efflux, and, critically forming a physical barrier against the infiltration of pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, from the external environment. TEER measurements are typically performed using chopstick electrodes or Endohm chambers, providing real-time, non-destructive monitoring of barrier development and maturation in cultured epithelial sheets [7]. This functional outcome reflects the impact of scaffold stiffness and differentiation methods on tight junction formation and barrier integrity.",
        "Molecular permeability testing evaluates the selective permeability of the epithelial barrier by quantifying the passage of various tracer molecules across the engineered tissue [68,69]. This is typically achieved using fluorescently labeled dextrans of different molecular weights (e.g., 4 kDa, 10 kDa, 40 kDa) or small-molecule drugs [10,70]. By measuring the flux of these tracers from one side of the epithelial monolayer to the other, researchers can determine the degree of restriction imposed by the barrier. Functional epithelium should exhibit a highly restricted permeability, particularly to larger molecules, while allowing for the passage of smaller, necessary ions and nutrients [71]. This selectivity is vital for nutrient exchange and maintaining the appropriate osmotic environment. A compromised barrier, conversely, would show increased permeability to larger molecules, indicating leaky tight junctions or cellular damage. This assay complements TEER by providing insight into the size-exclusion properties of the barrier [19]. These permeability characteristics have been linked to scaffold pore size and surface chemistry, underscoring the importance of scaffold design in achieving physiological barrier function.",
        "Tight junctions (TJs) are multiprotein complexes located at the most apical aspect of the lateral cell membrane, forming a continuous seal around epithelial cells [72]. They are the primary structural components responsible for establishing and maintaining the epithelial barrier, regulating paracellular transport, and separating distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains. Key tight junction proteins include occludin, various claudins (e.g., claudin 1, claudin 3, claudin 7), and zonula occludens (ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3) proteins, which link the transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton [9,58]. Immunofluorescence microscopy is commonly used to visualize the continuous circumferential localization of these proteins at cell–cell borders, indicating proper tight junction formation [73]. Western blotting or qPCR can quantify the expression levels of these components. Proper localization and robust expression of these proteins are direct indicators of a functional tight junction network. Disrupted or mislocalized tight junctions are hallmarks of a compromised epithelial barrier [74]. The expression and organization of these proteins are enhanced by specific differentiation protocols and scaffold surface modifications, further demonstrating the interplay between biomaterial design and cellular function.",
        "The corneal epithelium plays a crucial physiological role in maintaining fluid homeostasis within the cornea, actively participating in water transport to regulate stromal hydration and transparency [75]. Furthermore, it acts as the primary barrier to the ocular penetration of topically applied drugs. Fluid transport studies, often involving the measurement of fluid movement across the epithelial sheet under defined osmotic or hydrostatic gradients, provide direct evidence of the tissue’s ability to regulate water balance [43]. Concurrently, in vitro permeability assays for ophthalmic drugs are conducted to assess how effectively the engineered epithelium allows or restricts the passage of therapeutic compounds [64,76]. This not only informs the regenerative success by demonstrating physiological functionality but also has significant implications for future therapeutic applications, guiding the formulation and delivery of ophthalmic medications [53,61]. A well-functioning epithelial barrier should allow for controlled drug penetration while maintaining its protective role. These functional capabilities are influenced by scaffold composition and structural properties, which affect epithelial differentiation and barrier tightness.",
        "A successful and sustained ocular surface reconstruction hinges not only on the integrity of the epithelial layer but also, critically, on the health and functionality of the underlying corneal stroma and corneal endothelium. While the focus of this review is on the corneal epithelium, it is imperative to acknowledge that the epithelial layer cannot maintain its clarity or structural integrity in isolation.",
        "The corneal stroma, comprising the bulk of the cornea, provides the essential structural support and contributes significantly to corneal transparency [9,54]. A healthy stroma is vital for proper epithelial adhesion and differentiation. Likewise, the corneal endothelium plays a pivotal role in maintaining corneal deturgescence, actively pumping fluid out of the stroma [75,77]. Dysfunction of either the stroma or the endothelium can lead to corneal edema, scarring, and ultimately vision loss [11,13], thereby compromising even a perfectly reconstructed epithelial surface.",
        "Furthermore, the biointegration of the epithelial carrier with the residual corneal stroma is critical for epithelial survival and further differentiation. The close interplay between these layers ensures the necessary nutrient supply, waste removal, and biochemical signaling that are indispensable for the long-term viability and proper functioning of the newly reconstructed epithelial tissue [69]. Without robust biointegration, the epithelial graft may delaminate, leading to persistent defects and failure of the reconstructive effort. Therefore, strategies for ocular surface reconstruction must carefully consider and address the health and regenerative potential of the underlying corneal stroma and endothelium to achieve lasting success. This underscores the importance of scaffold design and biomaterial properties that promote not only epithelial function but also integration with stromal and endothelial layers.",
        "The field of regenerative medicine has seen a surge of interest in extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, which are nanoscale lipid bilayer vesicles naturally released by cells [17,19,73,78]. These fascinating biological nanoparticles act as crucial mediators of intercellular communication by carrying a diverse cargo of proteins, lipids, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) from their parent cells to recipient cells. Found abundantly in various biological fluids such as saliva, tears, urine, and blood, EVs possess remarkable potential for therapeutic applications due to their ability to transfer genetic information and bioactive molecules, influencing recipient cell behavior.",
        "In the context of corneal reconstruction, EVs secreted by various stem cell populations—such as limbal stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells—are gaining significant attention [10,79]. These stem cell-derived EVs can recapitulate many of the beneficial effects of their parent cells, including promoting cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, while also exerting anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and pro-angiogenic effects [57,60]. For instance, studies have shown that EVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells can accelerate corneal epithelial wound healing, reduce corneal scarring, and promote nerve regeneration [11,14]. Their small size and natural membrane make them ideal carriers for targeted drug delivery to the ocular surface, potentially reducing systemic side effects [50,80].",
        "The therapeutic utility of EVs in corneal reconstruction lies in their capacity to deliver specific biomolecules that can modulate the corneal microenvironment, suppress detrimental immune responses, and foster tissue repair [20,52]. This non-cellular approach offers several advantages over direct cell transplantation, including reduced immunogenicity, easier storage, and a lower risk of tumor formation. Further research into isolating, characterizing, and engineering these potent nanocarriers holds immense promise for developing novel, cell-free strategies to restore corneal clarity and function in patients suffering from severe corneal diseases. Integrating knowledge of EVs with scaffold design and stem cell differentiation approaches could further enhance functional outcomes and clinical efficacy.",
        "These functional parameters—TEER, molecular permeability, tight junction analysis, and fluid/drug transport studies—serve as a rigorous and comprehensive framework for evaluating the overall barrier competence and physiological functionality of stem cell-derived corneal epithelium, stromal cells and endothelial cells, thereby guiding its continued development toward safe and effective clinical use. Finally, EVs play an important role in the development of optimal strategies of corneal repair.",
        "The strategic design of biocompatible scaffolds is paramount for supporting cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation in corneal tissue engineering [19,31]. These scaffolds serve not only as carriers for stem cell-derived epithelial sheets but also play a critical role in facilitating the seamless integration of engineered constructs with host corneal tissue [27,79]. An ideal scaffold should precisely mimic the native extracellular matrix, support stratified epithelial growth, maintain transparency, and allow for robust integration without provoking inflammation or fibrosis [33,53,60] (Figure 3). There are two types of biomaterials commonly used in corneal regeneration: natural and synthetic biomaterials. Each type has its own strengths and limitations (Table 3).",
        "Natural biomaterials are widely explored for their inherent biocompatibility and bioactivity, closely resembling the native corneal environment [43,62] (Table 3). Materials such as amniotic membrane, hyaluronic acid, collagen, chitosan, gelatin, and silk fibroin are commonly utilized [26,52,81]. Additionally, decellularized corneal tissue offers a truly biomimetic option, preserving the intricate architecture of the native cornea [82]. These materials effectively promote epithelial cell attachment, support cell proliferation, and help maintain native cellular morphology and function. However, their inherent properties often necessitate structural enhancement through cross-linking or combination with other materials to improve mechanical stability, control degradation rates, and ensure long-term integrity in vivo [25,70]. For instance, collagen and hyaluronic acid are crucial components of the corneal stroma and can be used to create hydrogels that support cellular growth and nutrient exchange [27,30].",
        "Synthetic polymers offer tunable physical properties that are critical for creating scaffolds with precise characteristics [47,83] (Table 3). Materials like polyurethane, polycaprolactone (PCL), and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogels allow for precise control over physical properties such as stiffness, elasticity, transparency, and degradation rate [77,78]. Their versatility enables customization to match the specific biomechanical and optical requirements of different layers of the cornea [17,61]. For example, porous PCL scaffolds can be engineered to match the curvature and thickness of the human cornea. While synthetic polymers offer excellent structural control, their bioactivity may need to be supplemented through surface functionalization with cell adhesion motifs (e.g., RGD peptides) or by serving as vehicles for the sustained delivery of growth factors and bioactive molecules [32,59].",
        "Advanced scaffold designs increasingly combine the strengths of both natural and synthetic materials to leverage their synergistic properties [15,31]. This combinatorial approach allows for scaffolds that offer superior mechanical integrity, tunable degradation kinetics, and enhanced biological cues. Examples of such innovations include:Electrospun polyurethane–silk nanofiber scaffolds: These composite scaffolds create a fibrous network that closely mimics the natural extracellular matrix, promoting robust epithelial regeneration and demonstrating improved mechanical strength [43,67].Collagen membranes cross-linked with UV/riboflavin: This technique enhances the mechanical stability and enzymatic resistance of collagen membranes, providing improved support for epithelial growth and reducing premature degradation [9,84].Porous hyaluronic acid hydrogels: The porous structure of these hydrogels significantly enhances nutrient diffusion throughout the scaffold, which is crucial for cell viability and metabolism, and improves compatibility with endothelial cells, which are highly sensitive to their microenvironment [67,68].Cultured oral mucosal epithelial cell sheets, when applied in LSCD models, have demonstrated the remarkable ability to restore proteasome function, indicating significant potential for regenerative therapy by addressing cellular stress and protein degradation pathways [14,80].3D Bioprinting: This cutting-edge technology allows for the precise deposition of cells and biomaterials layer by layer, enabling the creation of highly complex and anatomically accurate corneal constructs with defined cellular arrangements and spatial control over growth factor delivery. This offers unprecedented control over scaffold architecture, moving towards truly personalized corneal grafts [11,73].Smart and responsive scaffolds: Future developments include scaffolds that can respond to physiological cues, such as pH changes or enzymatic activity, to release therapeutic agents or degrade at a controlled rate, further optimizing the regenerative process [7,35].",

        "As scaffold materials and fabrication technologies continue to evolve, the ability to construct fully functional, biointegrative corneal grafts becomes increasingly feasible [22,54]. These advancements are opening the door to the development of clinical-grade tissue-engineered alternatives, offering renewed hope for patients suffering from various forms of corneal disease.",
        "Recent advances in stem cell-based therapies for corneal repair have successfully transitioned from preclinical studies to early-phase clinical trials, providing crucial proof-of-concept data for the safety and feasibility of engineered epithelial grafts [23,85]. A pioneering first-in-human trial at Osaka University Hospital evaluated the transplantation of allogeneic iPSC-derived corneal epithelial sheets in four patients with limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). Over a one-year follow-up, this study reported no graft-related adverse events and demonstrated improved corneal surface integrity in all patients [16,30].",
        "Further clinical investigations include a trial of autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) in LSCD patients, which yielded outcomes comparable to cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation, without reported adverse events [41,42]. Additionally, cultivated autologous limbal epithelial cell (CALEC) transplantation was performed in 15 patients to assess a new manufacturing protocol and its efficacy. While one unrelated bacterial infection was observed, grafts successfully achieved partial or complete restoration of corneal surface integrity [9]. A comprehensive review of cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET) trials consistently confirms positive outcomes with long-term stability. This review underscores the advantages of ex vivo cell expansion under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions for minimizing immune rejection and pathogen transmission [23,40].",
        "Moreover, mesenchymal stem cell-derived therapies continue to show significant promise. MSCs and their EVs exhibit the ability to modulate inflammation, promote epithelial healing, and reduce corneal neovascularization, positioning them as attractive candidates for cell-free or adjunctive approaches to traditional epithelial grafting [10,21,60]. These translational efforts collectively highlight the accelerating clinical momentum towards establishing safe, standardized, and scalable stem cell-based strategies for ocular surface reconstruction.",
        "Corneal regeneration offers significant promise for restoring vision lost to corneal damage. However, translating this potential into widespread clinical reality presents substantial challenges.",
        "Standardized differentiation protocols are urgently needed to ensure the consistent generation of functional corneal epithelial tissue and accelerate clinical translation. These frameworks must comprehensively address safety concerns related to cell sourcing, manufacturing, quality control, and rigorous clinical trial design. Refining surgical techniques for delivering cells and tissues to the cornea is crucial to minimize trauma and maximize graft integration [31,85]. Complications such as infection, hemorrhage, and graft dislocation remain significant safety concerns. Therefore, standardization and comprehensive practitioner training are essential for procedural consistency and improved patient outcomes [7,20,23,63].",
        "While allogeneic cell sources offer logistical advantages, they also carry immunogenic risks [86,87]. Immunological rejection remains a significant risk, even with autologous or HLA-matched cell sources [20,28]. The potential for teratoma formation, particularly with iPSC-derived cells, necessitates stringent quality control and differentiation protocols [69,70]. Long-term safety data for many emerging therapies are still lacking, requiring continued vigilance. The risk of pathogen transmission, especially with xenografts or certain donor-derived cells, demands rigorous safety screening [18,38]. Understanding and mitigating host immune responses will be critical, involving both immunosuppression protocols and tolerance-induction strategies. Xenotransplantation, despite offering an abundant cell source, introduces heightened immunogenicity and the potential for zoonotic disease transmission [41,80]. The choice of stem cell source—whether limbal stem cells, iPSCs, or mesenchymal stem cells—directly impacts therapeutic safety. Off-target differentiation, malignant transformation, and teratoma formation, particularly with pluripotent cells, must be rigorously assessed [53,55].",
        "Scaffolds and carrier materials used in corneal regeneration must be biocompatible and effectively support tissue integration. Inflammatory reactions, degradation, or toxicity associated with biomaterials could jeopardize graft success, making rigorous preclinical evaluation of biomaterials critical [34,44]. Achieving consistent, functional, and refractive visual outcomes remains a major challenge. Simply replacing damaged corneal tissue is insufficient: regenerated tissue must integrate seamlessly with the host stroma and effectively restore optical clarity and refractive power [4,19]. Generating functional limbal stem cells (LSCs) with long-term viability is vital to maintaining corneal homeostasis [49,67]. Moreover, accurately recapitulating the cornea’s complex cellular architecture and extracellular matrix organization remains a substantial barrier. Seamless integration of the regenerated epithelium with host stroma is essential to avoid graft shrinkage, opacification, and disease recurrence.",
        "Long-term studies are required to evaluate graft durability and monitor for delayed complications, including graft failure, cataracts, glaucoma, and recurrence of the original disease [42,88]. The influence of aging and systemic health on long-term graft function also warrants investigation. Finally, the economic burden of corneal regeneration therapies, stemming from the high costs of cell sourcing, culture, and transplantation, poses a significant barrier to accessibility [89]. Cost-reduction strategies, such as scalable manufacturing and the development of off-the-shelf therapies, are essential [60,90]. Comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses will be crucial to validate these advanced therapies relative to conventional corneal transplantation [62].",
        "Advancing the field of corneal regeneration hinges on several key areas of innovation and strategic development.",
        "Innovative strategies to minimize immune rejection are critical for improving graft survival. This includes gene editing to generate universal donor cells and the development of novel immunosuppressive regimens that are more targeted and less systemic [22,42]. Engineering biocompatible scaffolds that precisely mimic the native corneal microenvironment can significantly enhance cell engraftment, differentiation, and organized matrix formation [50,59]. These advanced scaffolds may also serve as effective delivery vehicles for growth factors and other bioactive molecules, further promoting tissue regeneration [56,57]. Emerging characterization techniques, such as single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics, will deepen our understanding of cell behavior and differentiation pathways, thereby enhancing both safety and efficacy [15]. Gene therapy represents a promising approach for correcting underlying genetic causes of corneal disease [19,39]. Coupling gene therapy with cell transplantation holds the potential for targeted and durable treatment strategies.",
        "Innovative in vitro and pharmacological applications are also emerging as key frontiers. Microfluidic organ-on-a-chip platforms and 3D human corneal epithelial tissue models now enable real-time assessment of barrier function, drug permeability, and toxicity, extending utility beyond graft transplantation [46,91]. Such platforms use stem cell-derived or primary corneal epithelial layers cultured under dynamic flow conditions to evaluate drug transport, TEER, and metabolic response, offering more predictive and ethically favorable alternatives to animal models. Specifically, a corneal epithelium-on-a-chip model with microengineered porous membranes and flow demonstrated functional barrier properties and drug absorption profiling under pulsatile flow, mimicking tear dynamics and enabling permeability analysis suitable for preclinical drug testing [92,93,94]. Similarly, a 3D human corneal tissue model cultured at the air–liquid interface achieved TEER values of ~1000 ± 146 Ω·cm2 (comparable to native tissue) and exhibited tight junction protein expression along with drug-metabolizing enzyme and transporter gene profiles—facilitating drug permeability and safety testing [95]. Conventional in vitro corneal tissue models—such as HCE-T cell-based 3D constructs—have also been widely validated for ocular toxicology and permeability assays [95].",
        "The development of advanced preclinical models, including humanized animal models and sophisticated in vitro tissue constructs, will improve the predictive power of safety and efficacy assessments before human trials [73,96]. Furthermore, well-designed clinical trials with extended follow-up are essential to thoroughly evaluate the long-term outcomes and durability of regenerative therapies [34,78]. Moving forward, personalized therapeutic approaches tailored to an individual patient’s disease phenotype and genetic profile may further enhance treatment success. AI-powered imaging tools offer significant potential to assess graft quality, predict outcomes, and monitor long-term corneal health with unprecedented precision [29,37]. High-resolution imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), will provide more accurate assessment of the severity of LSCD and provide more detailed visualization of regenerated tissue structure and function [71,97].",
        "Finally, efforts to streamline cell culture methods, identify alternative cell sources, and optimize manufacturing workflows are essential for reducing treatment costs and improving accessibility. Comprehensive health economic evaluations will be necessary to assess the long-term value and sustainability of these advanced regenerative therapies [43,45,63,81].",
        "Autologous stem cell-derived corneal epithelium with functional barrier properties holds immense promise for overcoming the limitations of current corneal reconstruction strategies. While substantial progress has been made, ongoing research is essential to ensure the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of this innovative approach. Stem cell-derived corneal epithelium has been successfully generated from a variety of sources, including ESCs, iPSCs, MSCs, LSCs, and ASCs [40,58,98]. Optimized differentiation protocols consistently reproduce critical functional features such as tight junction formation, selective permeability, and robust transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Advances in biocompatible scaffolds and cell-sheet engineering have further enabled the construction of functional corneal epithelium suitable for transplantation [59,99]. Autologous stem cell strategies offer significant advantages, including personalized grafts, reduced immunogenicity, and the potential to eliminate long-term immunosuppression. These cells also support wound healing and provide crucial trophic factors that aid regeneration [20,81].",
        "Looking ahead, the future of stem cell-engineered corneal epithelium is highly promising. Nevertheless, challenges persist. Establishing standardized protocols, acquiring long-term safety data, ensuring immune compatibility, optimizing scaffold integration, and developing reproducible manufacturing processes are crucial. Additionally, improving surgical delivery methods, enhancing long-term graft performance, and guaranteeing scalability and affordability will be critical for widespread clinical adoption. Emerging innovations, such as gene-edited immune-evasive cell lines, biomimetic scaffolds, single-cell omics for fine-tuning differentiation, gene–cell combination therapies, AI-driven graft assessment, and rigorous clinical and economic evaluations, are collectively shaping a clear path toward clinically viable corneal regeneration. As stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and biomaterial science continue to converge, the potential for safe, effective, and accessible treatment for corneal blindness grows increasingly within reach.",

These ectodermal cells, when exposed to specific differentiation media and growth factors, can be directed to form limbal stem cells, which further differentiate into corneal epithelial cells.

        "Periodontitis represents a persistent, multifaceted condition that impacts the soft and hard tissues supporting the dentition, influencing over 50% of the adult population. Periodontal defects are caused by inflammation and related destruction of the periodontium. The periodontium is the tooth-supporting complex containing the gingiva, alveolar bone, periodontal ligament (PDL), and cementum.1-3 Most teeth are extracted due to periodontal disease. Periodontitis is also related to systemic diseases. Periodontal pathogenic factors are critical risk elements for neurodegenerative conditions (specifically Alzheimer’s disease), diabetic conditions, cardiac disorders, malignancies, immune-related disorders, and a variety of other systemic diseases.4,5 Therefore, it seems that the treatment of periodontitis is critical to improving overall health.",
        "Conventional therapies for periodontitis include improving oral hygiene, scaling and root planing, and periodontal surgery to access the subgingival areas. These treatment methods are usually effective for preventing disease progression but cannot regenerate lost tissues. Therefore, finding new therapeutic approaches that can regenerate periodontal tissues is necessary.",
        "Various periodontal regenerative strategies exist, including guided tissue regeneration (GTR), induced tissue regeneration (ITR), and stem cell therapy. The basis of GTR is to use a membrane that excludes the supra-crestal cells and leads to the proliferation of periodontium. ITR is based on applying enamel matrix derivatives (EMDs), which attract the progenitor cells to the area, modulate inflammation, and promote angiogenesis.1,2,4,6-8 The third option is based on stem cells, primitive cell groups capable of maturing into specialized cell forms.",
        "Three types of stem cells can be distinguished: somatic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Hematopoietic, mesenchymal, intestinal, neuronal, epidermal, and hair follicle stem cells are among the varieties of somatic stem cells.9 Somatic stem cells, particularly mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), are frequently used due to ethical issues regarding ESCs and the unpredictable nature of iPSCs.10",
        "MSCs are capable of improving periodontal tissue regeneration. This regenerative potential means they could be a significant factor in reconstructing tissues lost due to periodontitis. MSCs have different resources, including blood from the umbilical cord, bone marrow, adipose tissue, skeletal muscles, etc. Also, MSCs can be gained from intraoral tissues such as dental pulp, dental follicles, and gingival connective tissues.11,12Figure 1 summarizes different sources of stem cells. More research on using stem cells to regenerate periodontal tissues has recently been published, and the field is still developing. This study aimed to determine whether stem cell treatment could effectively treat periodontal bone abnormalities.",
        "Various classifications are used for bony defects.13 According to Goldman and Cohen’s classification, periodontal defects can be divided into “infra-bony” and “supra-bony.” The base of the periodontal pocket is located coronally to the alveolar crest in supra-bony defects and apically in infra-bony defects. In another classification, Papapanou and Tonetti divided bony defects into supra-bony, infra-bony, and inter-radicular or furcation.14 The efficacy of stem cell application is closely associated with the morphology of the defect.13,15 Periodontal bony defects vary in morphology and regenerative potential, primarily based on whether the defect is contained or non-contained. The configuration of the defect directly affects the ability to achieve successful regeneration. Contained defects, also known as infra-bony defects, have bony walls surrounding the defect, creating a “contained” environment such as three-wall defects. These walls support the graft material and provide a favorable architecture for regeneration. The surrounding bone enhances cell migration, vascularization, and wound stability.14",
        "Retaining the graft material and promoting regeneration are challenging in non-contained defects since they lack sufficient surrounding bone walls. The absence of walls requires additional efforts to create a regenerative-friendly environment. Advanced techniques like 3D-printed scaffolds with stem cell therapy may improve outcomes. Stem cells can differentiate into osteoblasts, fibroblasts (PDL cells), and cementoblasts. This capability directly facilitates the formation of the triad of periodontal tissues required for regeneration. These cells secrete bioactive molecules like growth factors and cytokines, stimulating angiogenesis, modulating inflammation, and promoting regeneration. Injectable hydrogels or microspheres loaded with stem cells can fill irregularly shaped non-contained defects, adapting to the defect’s morphology. Though challenges remain, ongoing advancements in biomaterials and regenerative medicine hold great promise for the future of periodontal therapy.16,17",
        "Wang et al18 outlined the four fundamental biological principles, collectively known as PASS, which are essential for predictable bone regeneration. As illustrated in Figure 2, these principles include ensuring the primary closure of the wound, facilitating angiogenesis to prepare the crucial vascular supply, maintaining or creating adequate space, and ensuring the stability of the wound and the blood clot to promote regeneration.",
        "Primary closure of the soft tissue flap over the defect is critical to protect the regenerative area and prevent bacterial contamination. Stem cells thrive in a stable, isolated environment. Stem cells rely on a well-vascularized environment for survival and differentiation. Therefore, angiogenesis is essential for creating new bone, and dental stem cells are directly involved in the process by transforming into endothelial cells. Additionally, they encourage the development of vessels by releasing paracrine angiogenesis-inducing factors.19,20 Human leukocyte antigen G5, transforming growth factor, prostaglandin E2 and indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase are among the crucial elements that promote stem cell regeneration.21-24",
        "A stable three-dimensional scaffold or structure is required to maintain the defect space for tissue growth and prevent soft tissue collapse into the defect. Stem cells are often loaded on biodegradable scaffolds (e.g., collagen, hydroxyapatite, or bioactive ceramics) that maintain the defect’s architecture. Distinct platforms are being created and tried to encourage the extraordinary bone-forming potential of dental mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs). Thus, cells that can promote intrinsic differentiation must exist for stem cell-based treatments.25,26",
        "Mechanical stability of the wound site is crucial to avoid disrupting the regenerative process and allow proper integration of new tissues. Micromovements can disrupt the attachment and differentiation of stem cells, impeding bone and PDL regeneration. The donor contexts and receptors are crucial in assessing the regenerative capability of transplanted MSCs during stem cell treatments.27 A sufficient supply of MSCs with osteogenic differentiation potential, appropriate bioactive substances to guide this differentiation, and scaffold biomaterials that support cellular interactions are three essential components of bone tissue engineering using stem cells. As a crucial factor, the availability of MSC promotes osteoblast formation and bone regeneration, whereas bioactive materials produce a favorable environment. However, scaffold biomaterials provide the structural framework required for the attachment of cells, differentiation, and proliferation. These components work together for effective bone regeneration.28-30",
        "As presented in Table 1, stem cells can be categorized into several types, including embryonic, induced pluripotent, and various subgroups of somatic stem cells, which are further discussed below.",
        "ESCs are self-renewing, multipotent cells obtained from embryonic inner cell clusters typically at the blastocyst stage, about 4‒5 days after fertilization.31 iPSCs are obtained from adult somatic cells such as skin or blood and are reprogrammed to revert to have the potential to reproduce different types of cells and share comparable properties with ESCs.32",
        "ESCs and iPSCs have tumorigenic characteristics, which is the main problem when applying them for regenerative treatments. The superiority of iPSCs compared to ESCs is in dealing with fewer ethical concerns. In experimental and animal studies, human-derived iPSCs could reproduce all cellular assemblies, including all three primary germ layers. As a resource of iPSCs, cells from dental tissues can be triggered to produce osteogenic cells to regenerate the periodontal bony defects. It has been demonstrated that mouse iPSCs incorporating scaffolds like EMD gel can improve periodontal regeneration, but the use of ESCs is controversial due to ethical concerns regarding the destruction of embryos to obtain them.31",
        "In 2000, Gronthos et al33 identified dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). In vitro, DPSCs can differentiate into odontoblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and myoblast-resembled cells. DPSCs have the same specifications as bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) but have a higher proliferation rate and lower osteogenic capacities. The most common dental pulp stem cell resources are wisdom teeth and first premolars. The dental pulp’s main purpose is to generate primary dentin during tooth development. As the tooth matures, the pulp produces secondary dentin that progressively matures. In response to pathological stimuli, the pulp generates tertiary dentin, a protective mechanism against external threats. The immature stem cells within the dental pulp can transform into odontoblasts, fibroblasts, and other cell types essential for pulp function and regeneration. Various growth factors and odontotropic agents can influence this differentiation process.34",
        "Carious dental pulp stem cells (CDPSCs) are extracted from human teeth with deep caries. Compared to DPSCs, CDPSCs have shown a higher potential for proliferation, mineralization, and expression of osteogenic and dentinogenic genes, attributed to more active angiogenesis activity than normal tissue.35,36 Their exact biological characteristics are unclear, but they have shown more colony formation compared with non-carious tissue, which could be attributed to more vascular endothelial growth factor expression in these cells. However, the capabilities of these cells need further investigation.37",
        "Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) were discovered in 2003. As Miura et al38 first described, harvesting SHEDs is a simple, convenient procedure with minimal stress. Enzymatic digestion and tissue transplantation are the two recognized techniques for cultivating SHEDs. The pulp tissues of the deciduous teeth are separated for enzymatic digestion with dispase and collagenase to isolate stem cells. The latter method allows stem cells to proliferate clonally by placing mechanically minced pulps on the tissue culture plates.39-41 Based on studies, SHEDs can transform into more cells than DPSCs, such as osteoblast-like, odontoblast-like, and adipocytes.42 Based on recent studies, SHEDs originating from deciduous teeth have characteristics similar to the umbilical cord, and they can reproduce more cell groups. The superiority of SHEDs over DPSCs is a higher level of proliferation, but SHEDs cannot regenerate a dentin-pulp-like complex. SHEDs have the advantage of not requiring immune system suppression during transplantation, and their application raises fewer ethical concerns. SHEDs could be obtained from intact primary incisors, canines, and primary molars extracted early for orthodontic treatments.43",
        "Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) can be obtained from the perivascular wall of mature PDLs and the middle third of the root surface of extracted permanent dentition. PDLSCs with different origins have different properties. Table 2 shows the types of PDLSCs and their characteristics. Compared to BMSCs, PDLSCs have a higher capacity for the regeneration of adipocytes and osteoblasts. According to studies, the regeneration and transplantation potential of PDLSCs has an inverse relationship with donor age.44 PDLSCs have a morphology similar to fibroblasts and can form collectives with high proliferation rates. They can also regenerate collagen filaments, cementum, and Sharpey’s fibers, which are PDL threads that connect to the periosteum of the jawbone and are capable of tissue regeneration.45",
        "The tooth germ can be obtained from the third molar of 10‒16-year-old humans. Different parts like the enamel organ and the dental papilla create the tooth germ. Also, the dental follicle is an elastic connective capsule of ectomesenchymal origin encircling the tooth germ during the developing stages, which has an essential effect on tooth eruption. For the first time, dental follicle stem cells (DFSCs) were obtained from animal models in 1992 and the human 3rd molars in 2005. DFSCs can transform into osteoblasts, cementoblasts, PDL cells, and other cell types; therefore, they can be helpful in periodontal regeneration.46-49 DFSCs have more extraordinary proliferative ability, and their protein expressions closely resemble those of neural crest cells.50 DFSC can regenerate the tooth root, bone, cement, PDL, and dentin pulp-like tissues.51",
        "Stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP) were initially introduced by Sonoyama et al52 and obtained from the apical area of a developing permanent tooth. Based on studies, SCAPs can be transformed into cells like osteoblasts, odontoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and hepatocytes. Figure 3 compares SCAPs with other types of stem cells.53-56 Some advantages of SCAPs include their application in the healing and regeneration of pulp in immature teeth and their high survival rate.57 Some studies acknowledge that SCAPs are an unrivaled group of postnatal stem cells because of the CD24 markers.58 The protein CD24 is highly glycosylated, as demonstrated by various cell types, primarily immunological and central nervous system cells. It appears as a signaling molecule that regulates cell homeostasis, proliferation, and differentiation.59 Due to osteoinduction conditions in culture, SCAPs start downregulating their expression of CD24 while increasing the synthesis of alkaline phosphatase.58 According to recent research, CD24 is required for SCAPs to undergo optimal adipogenic differentiation; however, it does not affect the osteogenic differentiation of SCAPs. Additionally, CD24 may enhance SCAP adipogenic differentiation by regulating PPAR g2mRNA expression.59",
        "The most common odontogenic stem cell resources. These include the DPSC (dental pulp stem cells), ABMSC (alveolar bone marrow stem cells), PBMSC (peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells), PDLSC (periodontal ligament stem cells), GMSC (gingival mesenchymal stem cells), SCAP (stem cells from the apical papilla), and CDPSC (carious dental pulp stem cells). The image was created with the help of ChatGPT-4",
        "The four key biological principles, PASS (primary wound closure, angiogenesis, space maintenance, and stability of the wound), which are crucial for predictable bone regeneration",
        "This figure compares the capacities of dental follicle stem cells (DFSC), stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP), dental pulp stem cells (DPSC), periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSC), and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSC) in terms of their regenerative potential",
        "Bone marrow is among the primary resources of MSCs.60 The capacity of BMSCs to multiply extensively and differentiate into different cell types has been exceptional; nevertheless, their application for periodontal abnormalities has produced mixed results. BMSCs in three-wall intra-bony defects demonstrated limited influence on bone regeneration; however, grade III furcation defects and fenestrations showed more significant responses by increased bone regeneration, indicating that the structural characteristics of the defect are intimately linked to the efficacy of these cells.61 According to an experimental study, biphasic scaffold integrating intrafibrillar mineralized collagen (IMC) and concentrated growth factors synergistically enhance the regeneration of periodontal tissues.62",
        "Alveolar bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ABMSCs) can be isolated and expanded with a 70% success rate from the human mandibular alveolar bone. These cells can be obtained conveniently from extracted third molar sites or during implant osteotomy procedures. Compared to BMMSC, ABMSC exhibits higher osteogenic differentiation but lower chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation. Also, it appears that ABMSCs have more potent immunomodulatory qualities than BMSCs.63-65",
        "For the first time in 1932, Dr. Fell66 successfully cultivated the periosteum-derived MSCs (PSCs) and reported that they formed a mineralized matrix with the osteogenic potential of the periosteum. A proper source of PSCs in the oral cavity is the internal layer of the periosteum.67 PSCs can be transformed into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. They can be applied in sinus elevation procedures and reconstruction of large bony defects. PSCs have more potential for creating new bone due to their osteogenic capacity than BMSCs and could be a better choice in regenerating periodontal defects.66,68-71",
        "Zhang et al72 isolated and described gingival mesenchymal stem cells derived from wounds (GMSCs) in 2009 for the first time. GMSCs are frequently isolated from wound sites because of their high immunoregulatory properties and infection resistance, making them perfect for accelerating tissue regeneration and wound healing.73 GMSCs have gained interest for their multipotent nature and ability to transform into diverse cell groups such as osteocytes, odontoblasts, and myocytes. Their immunomodulatory properties and multilineage differentiation capabilities make them suitable for promoting tissue regeneration.74,75 The apparent benefit of gingival stem cells is their easy isolation from the gingival tissue following tooth extraction or a biopsy. GMSCs, in conjunction with a hydrogel scaffold, have been applied for the regeneration of maxillary alveolar bony defects.76",
        "The MSC derived from periapical cysts (hPCy-MSCs) was obtained from human periapical cysts in 2013. Adipocytes and osteoblasts are among the cell types that can be produced from hPCy-MSCs. These cells are viable for regenerative purposes because of their many advantages, including easy harvest without harming adjacent healthy tissues. They also have proangiogenic and immunomodulatory capabilities. One of their main attributes is being a core part of the bone regeneration process in the periapical area. To regenerate the intended area, they can be added to different scaffolds, such as chitosan and polylactic-co-glycolic acid. However, more studies are needed before they can be used as a routine source of stem cells.77-79",
        "Gimble and Guilak80 introduced adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in the early 2000s. The adipose tissue has 100‒500 times higher concentrations of stem cells than marrow; therefore, it could be a better choice than BMSC. ADSCs have significant benefits due to the abundant adipose tissue and the minimally invasive isolation methods.81 According to a recent systematic review, ADSCs have been used in bone tissue engineering for defects associated with dental implants and periodontal defects due to their unique abilities. They have also demonstrated the capability to regenerate pulp tissue in animal studies.82 However, more studies are required before they can be used in clinical practice.",
        "Peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells (PBMSCs) are promising avenues for periodontal regeneration due to their multipotent differentiation capacity and ease of collection compared to other stem cell sources. These cells can differentiate into osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and other cell types critical for regenerating periodontal tissues. PBMSCs can be harvested through minimally invasive techniques and exhibit immunomodulatory properties, reducing inflammation and promoting tissue repair. The stem cells can be combined with a platelet-rich fibrin matrix as a scaffold in bony defects. Advances in scaffold technologies and biomaterials have further enhanced the delivery and efficacy of PBMSCs in periodontal applications. Their ability to promote angiogenesis and secrete growth factors makes them a vital tool in regenerative periodontal therapies, offering a biologically driven alternative to traditional treatments.83",
        "Animal studies are essential in researching stem cells for periodontal defects because they offer substantial insights that cannot be obtained from in vitro studies (Table 3). Periodontal tissues consist of a complex structure in the oral environment. Animal models are more effective for studying regeneration because they enable biopsy collection for histologic analysis, which provides a direct, detailed view of tissue regeneration. This approach offers more precise insights into cellular behavior and tissue structure than clinical or radiographic assessments. These preclinical studies provide a domain where the interaction of stem cells with these structures can be studied in a living system. They also help detect potential adverse effects, such as immune reactions, unwanted differentiation, or tumor formation. For example, rodent models are advantageous for examining essential biological processes and mechanisms in periodontal regeneration. Although they may not entirely emulate the intricacy of human periodontal disease, they function as pivotal preliminary platforms for evaluating the viability of stem cell therapy. Studies on pigs can also yield helpful information because the periodontium and tooth anatomy of these animals are similar to that of humans.84",
        "The safety and efficacy of a novel injectable material composed of PDLSCs encapsulated in calcium phosphate cement (CPC) paste and biodegradable alginate fibers were evaluated using rat models. Five experimental groups were studied, including CPC alone and CPC combined with varying metformin concentrations. The research assessed the mechanical properties, release, injectability, and osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. The alginate fibers degraded within seven days, releasing PDLSCs and significantly enhancing cell proliferation. The findings suggest that the injectable CPC formulation with PDLSCs and 0.1% metformin exhibits exceptional potential for bone regeneration.85",
        "Zhang et al86 evaluated the efficacy of using PDLSCs in bony defects in mini pigs. They compared two different scaffolds for carrying the stem cells. IMC was compared with hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffolds. IMC closely replicates the natural organization of bone’s extracellular matrix by incorporating mineralized collagen fibrils at the nanoscale, facilitating cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. The results were evaluated after 12 weeks. The percentage of new bone was about 45% in the IMC and 29% in the HA group, and the nano-structure of the new bone formation was closer to that of natural bone in the IMC group, which proved to be a better scaffold for PDL stem cells.",
        "In another animal study, bone marrow was collected from the iliac crests of nine mongrel dogs, and the stem cells were cultivated. These cells were integrated with inorganic bovine bone mineral (ABBM) and inserted into surgically created intra-bony periodontal defects. The control group was treated solely with ABBM. Two months after implantation, histological and histometric evaluations were conducted. The results indicated that the test group, which received the BMSCs-loaded ABBM, showed significantly greater novel cementum and PDL regeneration than the control group. These findings suggest that BMSCs combined with ABBM have substantial potential for periodontal regeneration.87",
        "Another study explored the potential of gingival margin-derived stem cells (G-MSCs) for periodontal regeneration combined with a synthetic extracellular matrix. The researchers created periodontal defects in four sites of eight miniature pigs. G-MSCs were isolated from the free gingival margin of the pigs and tested for progenitor cell characteristics. These cells were then expanded and incorporated into the matrix. The study assessed several clinical and radiographic factors, bone and cementum regeneration, junctional epithelium length, and connective tissue attachment at 16 weeks. The results showed that the G-MSCs exhibited characteristics of stem cells. When combined with the matrix, there was significant improvement in clinical outcomes, including bone and cementum regeneration and less gingival recession, compared to the control group. The combination also improved bleeding on probing. The study concluded that G-MSCs have significant potential for periodontal regeneration.88",
        "Iwasaki et al16 investigated the PDLSC-amnion’s capacity for regeneration in periodontal defects of a rat model. Amniotic membranes were used to transfer cultivated PDLSCs using photolithography and a surface made of glass coated with polyethylene glycol. PDLSC properties were investigated using experimental differentiation and flow cytometry. Periodontal defects surgically established in maxillary molars were transplanted with PDLSC-amnion. Periodontal regeneration was examined after four weeks using histology and micro-computed tomography. PDLSCs and MSCs shared the expression of cell-surface proteins such as CD90, CD105, CD146, and STRO-1 and the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts. Despite the motion and deformation restored by surgical instruments, the amnion-derived PDLSCs showed one even layer of PDLSCs on their membranes and retained durability. According to these findings, amnion-derived PDLSCs could be used to regenerate periodontal defects.",
        "PDLSCs can also be used as growth factor carriers to enhance the regenerative process further. Jung et al89 analyzed the potential of engineered PDLSCs to express bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) in mice. These cells formed more dense bone than the control group, showing more osteogenic potential. Khorsand et al90 determined how DPSCs affected the reconstruction of experimentally created periodontal lesions in a canine model. Ten dogs of mixed breeds had their first inferior premolars surgically altered to have proximal three-walled periodontal defects on both sides caused by ligature-induced periodontitis. The maxillary premolars of the same dogs were used to harvest DPSCs. Almost one month later, the experimental case was established, and a self-derived third-passage mixture of DPSCs with Bio-Oss was inserted into one side (test group). In contrast, Bio-Oss alone was introduced on the opposite side (control group). After eight weeks, regeneration was observed histologically and morphometrically, including bone, PDL, and cementum.",
        "In a canine model, Tobita et al91 evaluated whether combining ASCs with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) could enhance periodontal regeneration. PRP and self-derived ASCs were applied to sites with periodontal defects, while control sites received only PRP or no treatment. Histological, immunohistochemical, and radiographic analyses were performed one and two months after treatment. The regenerated cementum and bone in the defect areas were measured. The results showed that regeneration was significantly greater two months after treatment compared to one month, with noticeable increases in radiopacity in the defect regions by two months. The group treated with ASCs and PRP demonstrated proper regeneration at two months. The study concluded that self-derived ASCs and PRP effectively promoted periodontal tissue regeneration, helping to create the necessary framework for this complex tissue.",
        "In Tsumanuma and colleagues’ study,92 three types of stem cells, PDLSCs, ASCs, and BMSCs, were tested for periodontal regeneration using cell sheet transplantation. One-wall intra-bony defects were created in dogs to compare the effects of each cell source. Three layers of autologous cells from each group were grafted onto the exposed root surfaces and supported with woven polyglycolic acid. Collagen combined with β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) was used to treat the defects. After two months, the PDLSC group showed the most significant periodontal regeneration, with noticeable new cementum formation and well-aligned PDL fibers. These results suggest that PDLSC sheets combined with a β-TCP/collagen matrix have a strong potential for periodontal regeneration.",
        "Duan et al93 explored the opportunities and advantages of using EMDs and iPSCs to regenerate periodontal tissue. They initially assessed the impact of EMD gel on iPSCs in vitro, followed by a tissue engineering technique for periodontal regeneration. The study involved three experimental groups: one with a silk scaffold alone, another with EMD, and a third group combining EMD with iPSCs. After 24 days, the group treated with iPSCs showed significantly greater periodontal tissue regeneration. The findings demonstrated EMD’s role in guiding mesenchymal progenitors toward osteogenic differentiation and underscored the synergistic potential of combining iPSCs with EMD to enhance periodontal regeneration.",
        "Animal studies have consistently shown that stem cell-based treatments can promote the regeneration of alveolar bone and cementum, essential components of the periodontium. However, while short-term results in animal studies are promising, long-term studies are needed to ensure the sustained regeneration of periodontal tissues and prevent relapse or failure of the regenerated tissues.",
        "In different clinical trials, MSCs of various origins, including dental pulp, PDL, gingiva, bone marrow, and peripheral blood, have been applied to reconstruct the periodontal defects in periodontitis patients (Table 4). These stem cells can be combined with other growth factors, such as platelet fibrin matrix, to increase the chance of regeneration in periodontal defects. Sreeparvathy et al83 combined stem cells from the blood with this matrix, manufacturing a “supercell” material for defects with pocket depths of ≥ 6 mm. They designed a randomized clinical trial and followed their patients up to 6 months. Adding the stem cells to the fibrin matrix increased its efficacy, which is evident in clinical and radiographic analyses, and no adverse reactions were observed in any of the patients.",

        "Apatzidou et al94 evaluated the effectiveness and safety of three treatments for intrabody defects in a cohort of 27 patients. Participants were randomly divided into three categories. Autologous BMMSCs were given to group A. These cells were enhanced with fibrin/platelet lysate and then incorporated into collagen substrates. The scaffold without the stem cells was used in group B. An access flap without any scaffolds or stem cells was used for the third group. No adverse healing events were reported in the first year. Group A showed better results than group B, illustrating the role of stem cells in stimulating bone regeneration.",
        "A quasi-experimental study assessed the impact of dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells (DPMSCs) on periodontal disease in a cohort of 22 middle-aged adults. The stem cells were loaded on collagen scaffolds in the test group, and the scaffolds alone were used for the control group without the stem cells. Clinical and radiographic re-evaluations were carried out after six months. The test group demonstrated significant increases in bone mineral density and superoxide dismutase levels alongside reduced IL-1β levels, suggesting that DPMSC therapy enhanced bone regeneration and reduced inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in periodontitis patients.95",
        "Abdal-Wahab et al96 assessed the effects of GMSCs in intra-bony periodontal defects using clinical and biochemical methods. GMSCs were added to β-TCP and a collagen barrier in the test group. In the control group, the stem cells were not used. The test group showed a more significant decrease in pocket depth and increased clinical attachment level (CAL) and bone formation. Additionally, greater levels of PDGF-BB were seen in the GMSC group shortly after therapy, demonstrating its potential usefulness in improving growth factors in the defect.",
        "Although stem cells are a safe choice for periodontal regeneration, some studies have not reported an added benefit compared to bone grafts alone. For instance, xenogeneic bone substitutes have been beneficial in periodontal bony defects. However, adding PDLSCs did not lead to significantly more regeneration when added to the bone graft after 12 months in 1‒2-wall intra-bony defects.97",
        "A randomized clinical trial was conducted by Ferrarotti et al,98 including 29 patients with chronic periodontitis. After removing the tooth scheduled for extraction, it was cleaned for 60 seconds in 0.2% chlorhexidine. After that, it was given to the study coordinator in charge of isolating DPSCs. The coordinator used a Gracey curette to remove the pulp tissue and cut the tooth along the cementoenamel junction to reveal the pulp chamber. Patients in the test group were treated with DPSCs on a collagen sponge, and the control group received the collagen sponge alone. One year later, the test group exhibited more pocket reduction, CAL gain, and regeneration of bone.",
        "Another clinical study analyzed the reliability and potency of autologous PDL stem cell sheets in patients with periodontal defects who underwent tooth extractions. The extracted tooth was used for harvesting PDLSCs, which were transplanted to the defect using standard flap surgeries and then filled with beta-tricalcium phosphate granules. The results demonstrated improvements in clinical and radiographic parameters up to 55 months after the surgery. This approach was reportedly secure and efficacious for treating defects in severe periodontitis.99",
        "Shalini and Vandana100 assessed the impact of direct transplantation of PDLSC niches on intra-bony defects. The study included 28 patients in two groups: 14 received open flap debridement (OFD) with PDLSC niche transplantation, and the other 14 received OFD alone. Both groups exhibited significant clinical improvements, but the cell therapy group showed higher enhancement in defect density.",
        "A novel regenerative treatment employing self-derived MSCs with a 3-D woven-fabric compound framework and PRP evaluated the participants with periodontal diseases. Ten patients underwent surgical implantation of MSCs that were extracted from each subject’s iliac bone marrow by aspirating it one month before the periodontal surgery. The patients were monitored for 36 months. In this study, CAL, pocket depth, and linear bone growth (LBG) were evaluated, and based on the results, an average LBG of 4.7 mm was obtained in three years. This study concluded that MSC therapy is a harmless and successful intervention for periodontal defects.101",
        "Another clinical study investigated the efficacy of PDLSCs combined with bovine bone mineral components. Thirty cases of periodontal disease were randomly assigned to either the cell group, which received PDLSC plates with Bio-Oss and GTR, or the control group, which received GTR and Bio-Oss without stem cells. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups, but both showed notable increases in alveolar bone levels. There were no documented safety issues with the experimental PDLSCs.102",
        "All the studies mentioned above proved stem cells safe; however, some studies did not observe an added benefit for using stem cells compared to routine regenerative techniques.",
        "Periodontal regeneration techniques include GTR, growth factors like EMD, and stem cell therapy, each with distinct advantages and limitations. GTR uses barrier membranes to guide the regeneration of periodontal tissues, offering proven success in treating intra-bony and furcation defects. Still, it requires precise surgical technique, has a risk of infection from membrane exposure, and usually results in long junctional epithelium instead of true regeneration. Growth factors like EMD stimulate natural healing processes and are minimally invasive, making them suitable for shallow or single defects. However, their efficacy depends on patient factors, and they are expensive. Stem cell therapy, a cutting-edge approach, holds the promise of true tissue regeneration, particularly for extensive defects. Still, it remains experimental, mainly costly, and technically demanding, with ethical and regulatory challenges. The choice of technique depends on the defect type, patient-specific factors like systemic health and smoking status, and clinician expertise, with combination approaches often yielding the best results.",
        "True regeneration can only be assessed through histologic evaluations, although most relevant studies have predominantly evaluated radiographic and clinical parameters. Animal studies using stem cells have reported true periodontal regeneration, which was assessed histologically. In a study by Hu et al,103 histological evaluations verified that using DPSCs yielded actual periodontal bone regeneration in swine, with increased bone percentages and new cementum-like layers. Additionally, the test group showed positive expression of human β-globin and new Sharpey fibers. In another study, histological analyses showed that the bone marrow stem cells significantly increased periodontal tissue regeneration compared to the control groups.104 MSCs are commonly employed for periodontal regeneration because they can multi-differentiate. Extraoral stem cells such as BMSC and ASC and intraoral stem cells like PDLSC, DPSC, SCAP, DFSC, and SHED are receiving much attention in tissue engineering.105",
        "Direct and indirect comparisons have demonstrated that DPSCs are more effective for bone regeneration, while ADSCs promote cementum regeneration.106 Other studies have examined the efficacy of cell therapies in more complex experimental models, such as Cl III furcation or supra-alveolar defects. However, these investigations have yielded inconclusive results, failing to demonstrate a clear advantage of cell therapy. In such scenarios, choosing the proper carrier and precise management of the soft tissues are essential to prevent the regenerative technology from being exposed.107",
        "Exosomes are extracellular vesicles containing certain substances with biological activity, such as proteins and nucleic acids, which can induce regeneration. Various cell types, such as stem cells, dendritic cells, and epithelium cells, secrete exosomes. They are present in saliva in the oral cavity. Stem cell-based exosomes are a novel therapeutic approach because of their capability for regeneration. The exosomes secreted from oral source stem cells, such as PDLSC-exosomes and DFSCs, are beneficial in ameliorating the inflammation of periodontal tissues and improving periodontal regeneration and repair. The SHED-exosomes improve periodontal regeneration better than periodontal membrane cell-derived exosomes.108,109 Exosomes derived from SCAP exhibit significant promise for oral tissue regeneration. These exosomes may be a proper interventional method for dentin‒pulp complex regeneration. Furthermore, angiogenesis and soft tissue regeneration in a mouse model were markedly improved by the injection of SCAP-derived exosomes into the palatal gingival area.108,110 PDLSC exosome activity promotes proliferation, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis while controlling inflammatory responses, all of which help maintain periodontal homeostasis.111",
        "Recently, research focused on MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEV) as a potential substitute for stem cell therapy.112 sEVs offer advantages over MSC-based therapies, which face significant logistical challenges in manufacturing, handling, delivering, and storing cells for transplantation. They are ready to use and can be easily reformulated for various administration routes. Moreover, sEVs are easy to store and maintain biological activity during long-term storage, reducing the cost and time required for stem cell expansion from patients.113-117 The accessibility of stem cells is also challenging. Significant amounts of stem cells are required for treating periodontal defects, ranging from 5 × 104 to 2 × 108 cells per defect. This quantity is often challenging to procure from a single patient. While it is possible to cultivate stem cells in vitro, their capacity for self-renewal and proliferation typically diminishes with each passage.118 Another drawback of stem cell therapy is its lack of long-term evidence of its success. More controlled studies are needed before stem cells can be used in daily practice.119,120",
        "This study reviewed the potential of stem cells in regenerating periodontal bony defects, highlighting their diverse capabilities and limitations. PDLSCs demonstrated superior ability in producing osteoblasts, making them highly effective for regeneration. DFSCs showed versatility by regenerating multiple periodontal structures, including the ligament, cementum, and bone. ADSCs offer advantages due to their abundance and minimally invasive collection methods, while BMSCs were less successful in addressing intra-bony lesions. Despite their promise, challenges remain, including potential tumorigenic risks, ethical considerations, and variability in efficacy across different defect types. Future research should focus on optimizing the application of stem cells to enhance regenerative outcomes while addressing these challenges.",

Among cardiovascular diseases, the largest single cause of death is ischemic heart disease. Ischemic heart disease typically manifests as progressive constriction of the coronary arteries, which obstructs blood flow to the heart and can ultimately lead to myocardial infarction. This adversely affects the structure and function of the heart. Conventional treatments lack the ability to treat the myocardium lost during an acute myocardial infarction. Stem cell therapy offers an excellent solution for myocardial regeneration. Stem cell sources such as adult stem cells, embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells have been the focal point of research in cardiac tissue engineering. However, cell survival and engraftment post-transplantation are major limitations that must be addressed prior to widespread use of this technology. Recently, biomaterials have been introduced as 3D vehicles to facilitate stem cell transplantation into infarct sites. This has shown significant promise with improved cell survival after transplantation. In this review, we discuss the various injectable hydrogels that have been tried in cardiac tissue engineering. Exploring and optimizing these cell-material interactions will guide cardiac tissue engineering towards developing stem cell based functional 3D constructs for cardiac regeneration.

        "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects the heart and blood vessels [1]. CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide and contributes to an overall decline in the health of the population. It is estimated that, in 2022, 19.8 million deaths were linked to CVD [2]. Comprehensive epidemiological data from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study [3] indicate that ischemic heart disease (IHD), which falls within the spectrum of CVD, surpassed the COVID-19 pandemic as the direct leading cause of death around the world, and was the second leading cause of disease burden (Figure 1). It is estimated that approximately 250 million people worldwide are living with IHD and that about 9 million deaths are caused each year by this disease, 13% of the global annual mortality [3]. The prevalence of IHD globally is on an upward trend and is forecasted to continue to increase [1,3].",
        "A major cause of the overall increase in CVD is the ageing and growth of the population worldwide [4]. This issue warrants significant attention, as projections by the World Health Organisation indicate that the population over 60 will rise from 1 billion in 2019 to 1.4 billion by 2030, an increase of 40%. This upward trajectory is expected to continue, reaching 2.1 billion by 2050, marking a 50% increase [3,5,6]. As the population ages the prevalence and death toll associated with IHD and CVD are projected to increase. Therefore, it is becoming urgent to develop new therapeutic methods for cardiac tissue regeneration. In this review we discuss the use of hydrogels as substrates for the culture of stem cells and their differentiation into cardiac cells. We summarise the different types of natural and synthetic polymers used to create hydrogels, and discuss the most commonly used applications, injectable hydrogels, and hydrogel-based cardiac patches. Although many challenges still remain before the widespread clinical application of hydrogels, we can conclude that these materials hold great promise for the future of cardiac tissue regeneration.",
        "Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs predominantly due to a lack of blood flow to the heart. This typically arises from a blockage in the coronary arteries, which are responsible for supplying blood to the heart’s muscular tissue [7]. The obstruction may stem from a blood clot or the accumulation of fatty deposits known as plaque, leading to a condition referred to as atherosclerosis. When blood circulation to the heart’s muscle is obstructed, it results in the death of cardiac muscle cells [8]. MI can be fatal or lead to lifelong health complications. The heart has limited regenerative capabilities, so when the cardiac muscle cells die, the heart compensates by activating fibroblasts, this leads to fibrosis and the formation of scar tissue and over time weakens the heart’s ability to pump blood efficiently, eventually leading to heart failure [9]. Other MI complications involve arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, stroke, heart valve problems, and the increased risk of another MI occurring [9,10]. An analysis of Swedish national registries examining 97,254 patients who survived an MI one week after discharge showed that within 365 days, 18.3% of the patients suffered a further cardiovascular event: a stroke, reoccurring MI, or cardiovascular death. Furthermore, of the patients who did not experience a cardiovascular event in this period, 20% would experience one or more within the following 3 years [11], highlighting the significant long-term risk to patients post MI.",
        "The current treatment options available for MI are devised to restore blood flow to the heart as fast as possible to minimise tissue damage and prevent any future complications. These approaches range from pharmacological options such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which dissolves clots [12], to other medications, such as ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers, which help manage hypertension and decrease the heart’s need for oxygen. Non-invasive surgical options include percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which reduces the narrowing or blockage of the coronary artery [13]. However, in serious cases, a pacemaker or even a heart transplant may be required [12]. Despite advancements in healthcare, MI remains the leading cause of death globally [2]. Regenerative medicine holds a promising approach for the treatment and management of the complications caused by MI. Research efforts have focussed on therapeutic interventions such as biocompatible hydrogels that provide a supportive scaffold to the damaged area and promote tissue repair. Alongside this, stem cells can replace damaged cardiomyocytes with healthy ones [14]. The goal of these approaches is to promote cardiac tissue repair, regeneration, and the restoration of cardiac function following MI.",
        "The heart has very limited regenerative capabilities. Cardiac myocytes (CM) proliferation does occur in the adult mammalian heart but the rate of replacement with new cells is less than 1% annually [15,16], which is inadequate to replace the millions of CMs lost in infarcted heart tissue. Research is striving to find a way to stimulate heart regeneration, to treat the symptoms caused by heart disease and MI, or to prevent them from even occurring [17]. Cell culture is a key approach for researching the biological mechanisms of cells, tissues, and organs [18]. The inner physiological mechanisms of organs are very complex, making it difficult for two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures to accurately represent their properties and biomechanics in vivo [19]. Thus, research has been directed towards developing three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems, with the goal of replicating the organ’s internal processes, including the complex interactions between the cells and their extracellular environment [20,21]. Specifically, cardiac tissue contains cells with the ability to contract such as CMs and smooth muscle cells, alongside non-contractile cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and leukocytes. These cells interact with each other in a specific manner that is organised to form an intricate 3D structure, crucial for the heart to function [22]. While 2D cultures are still extensively used in the cardiovascular field and possess many benefits for in vitro research, 3D cell culture systems offer a more realistic environment that can produce cardiac-like structures, which better represent the complex cell interactions as seen in vivo [20].",
        "Cell transplantation is one of the most promising fields currently being studied in cardiac tissue regeneration. Stem cell therapy involves generating new CMs following an MI to replenish the lost tissue in the heart [17]. Stem cells are defined as undifferentiated cells with the capacity to endlessly self-renew and can be programmed to differentiate into a variety of different cell types [21] (Table 1). They can be derived from multiple sources such as the placenta, umbilical cord, bone marrow, adipose tissue, and dental pulp [22,23]. By using specific growth factors, these stem cells can be differentiated into different types of cells such as smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, or CMs [22]. Adult stem cells, sometimes referred to as somatic stem cells, can be classified via the tissue they came from such as skeletal myoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells [24] (Table 1).",
        "Skeletal myoblasts are progenitor cells that originate in skeletal muscle. They were the first type of cell to be studied for cardiac tissue regeneration because of their ability to regenerate muscle tissue following an injury [25]. These cells have many attractive properties, including easy isolation, quick in vitro expansion, and the capacity to resist ischemia [26]. Given all this, their potential was considered for studying the remuscularization of damaged heart tissue [34] and has been thoroughly researched in vivo [26]. In heart damage because of an MI, the use of skeletal myoblasts successfully prevented remodelling in the left ventricle (LV) while preserving its pressure and ejection fraction [26,34]. Additionally, the contractility of the myocardium was maintained, and the damaged heart saw an improvement in compliance [35]. Furthermore, skeletal myoblasts were the first to be used in a clinical setting. In 2000, a 72-year-old male was the first patient who was given autologous skeletal myoblasts alongside a coronary artery bypass. The patient had been diagnosed with heart failure as a result of a severe MI. A 5-month follow-up showed an increase in left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) and an overall improvement in his symptoms of heart failure [36,37]. This study opened the way for multiple isolated cases and further clinical trials to be pursued [35]. While these studies show the promise of using skeletal myocytes as a stem cell therapy, the majority of the clinical trials were performed alongside a coronary artery bypass or a left ventricular assist device which could have skewed the results [35,37]. As such, it is still unclear how effective the use of skeletal myocytes is in cardiac regeneration and further investigation is needed to fully determine the effectiveness of using skeletal myoblasts as a stem cell treatment for cardiac repair.",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells that have gained substantial interest in the field of regenerative medicine [26]. These cells are multipotent and can be derived from a range of tissues, most commonly bone marrow and adipose tissue, making them readily available [27]. MSCs can be differentiated into a variety of different cell types, including cardiomyocytes [26]. However, the results of using MSCs for cardiac regeneration have been mixed. Preclinical studies showed that transplanting MSCs into the heart after damage from an MI resulted in a marked improvement in cardiac function. On the other hand, the findings in multiple clinical trials showed that transplanting MSCs resulted in very limited help for patients with heart injuries [38,39,40]. There is still interest in investigating the potential of adult stem cells as a cell-based therapy. However, this potential has been obstructed by multiple limitations such as low cell retention, poor cell survival, and engraftment [27].",
        "Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were first discovered in mouse embryonic cells obtained from the inner mass of blastocytes [28]. Subsequently, scientists identified human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that can differentiate into all cell types and have the capacity for unlimited self-renewal. This discovery sparked great interest in the use of hESCs in tissue repair and organ regeneration [29]. However, their capacity to divide into any cell type is also a limitation as it can lead to the formation of cancerous tumours, making hESCs inappropriate for clinical use [30]. ESCs are also subject to ethical and political controversy, as the method of isolating these cells requires human embryos to be destroyed. People’s moral or religious beliefs question whether it is ethical to use human embryos, as they believe that an embryo represents a fully developed human [37]. However, this point of view is not shared by the entire population, which opens up debates and criticisms.",
        "Focusing on research in cardiac repair, multiple studies have shown that CMs derived from hESCs can provoke arrhythmia after transplantation [41,42]. Nevertheless, there is contrasting evidence from Liu et al., who demonstrated remuscularization in the damaged heart tissue of macaque monkeys with hESC-CM grafts in a 2018 study [43]. These grafts significantly improved cardiac function in an MI model; no teratomas were detected, and only one monkey suffered from minor arrhythmias. This study used a higher than standard dose of embryonic stem cells that fully differentiated into cardiomyocytes, replacing progenitor cells, which may have contributed to the difference in results when compared to the previous studies mentioned. The authors did acknowledge that the arrhythmias observed could be linked to the hESC-CM grafts [43]. Although there was a significant decrease in the number of arrhythmias in this study, it still calls into question the possibility of them arising in human trials using this protocol. Due to the safety and ethical concerns of ESCs, further research is still required to determine their potential in cell-based therapies for treating MI.",
        "In 2006, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were pioneered by Yamanaka’s group through the discovery of four transcription factors: SRY-box 2 (SOX2), Krüppel-like factor (Klf4), V-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-Myc), and octamer binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4) [31]. They demonstrated that the forced expression of these transcription factors in mouse embryonic fibroblasts or adult mouse fibroblasts could revert the cells into a pluripotent state, enabling them to differentiate into all three germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm [14]. Subsequently, they showed that this method could also be used to generate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) [32]. This discovery led to an alternative source of human stem cells that does not present the ethical complications of ESCs [33]. Additionally, hiPSCs have an even lower risk of immune rejection than other stem cells as they can be directly procured from each patient for individualised therapy [33,44]. One significant drawback of hiPSCs is their lack of maturity, which can cause issues after transplantation. The incorporation of the immature CMs derived from hiPSCs with the native adult CMs can disrupt electrical signalling, leading to an increased risk of arrhythmias [33,45]. In a 2016 study, cynomolgus monkeys were used to investigate the effects of injecting iPSC-CMs into the heart 14 days post MI [46]. The results revealed that the injected iPSC-CMs exhibited a survival period of 12 or more weeks and established electrical connections with the myocardium. Moreover, cardiac function and contractility showed improvement, alongside some remuscularisation of the damaged heart. Non-fatal arrhythmias were initially observed, possibly caused by the immaturity of the iPSC-CMs and their incomplete integration into the heart. However, by day 14, the frequency of these arrhythmias had started to decline, which may be attributed to the iPSC-CMs progressively maturing, improving their electrical integration into the heart [46]. Further research is being directed at developing strategies to facilitate the maturation of iPSC-CMs, among them incorporating biomaterials or fatty acids, using electrical stimulation, and increasing the culture time of the iPSCs [45,47]. Other studies have demonstrated that embedding hiPSC-CMs into an epicardial sheet and then transplanting the sheet onto the heart of an MI Porcine model showed improved left ventricular ejection fraction, contractility, and cardiac function [48,49]. While cardiac differentiation protocols are highly effective in generating hiPSC-CMs, the rate of differentiation may not always be 100% and any remaining undifferentiated iPSCs cells could cause tumour formation [50,51]. This highlights the potential iPSCs have in cardiac tissue regeneration. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges that need to be resolved before they can be effectively used for clinical application, especially those related to the delivery medium.",
        "Matrigel is a basement-membrane matrix that contains many proteins found in the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM itself is a highly complex structure composed of various proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans. These components are crucial for maintaining the plasticity and strength of the ECM [52]. The cardiac ECM regulates cellular growth and provides a supporting environment for cardiac cells such as CMs, vascular cells, fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells [53,54]. Replicating the ECM in cell culture is essential to creating a supportive environment to facilitate the differentiation and maturation of cardiac cells [54]. In this regard, Matrigel is widely considered the gold standard for cell culture as it mimics the roles of ECM in promoting cell growth and differentiation [55]. Collagen type IV, perlecan, laminin, and entactin are found in Matrigel alongside other basement membrane constituents, including proteases and growth factors [56], which play a crucial role in its function. However, there are major drawbacks of Matrigel, such as its undefined composition and batch-to-batch variation. Over 14,000 unique peptides and around 2000 proteins have been detected in Matrigel, and proteomic analyses show significant variability between batches [55]. In addition, as it is derived from mice, it can contain xenogenic contamination, further limiting its therapeutic potential [57]. It is also important to consider the ethical implications of its source, as Matrigel is produced from the Engelbreth–Holm–Swarm mouse tumour, an aggressive form of cancer that is induced in mice. This process causes significant suffering and distress to the animals as they endure the growth of the tumour, highlighting the importance of an alternative animal-free cell culture substrate [56]. All these limitations make Matrigel limited for clinical applications in cardiac tissue regenerative medicine. Thus, there is a need for the development of natural and synthetic biomaterials, such as hydrogels, to be used as alternative substrates for cell culture, growth, and differentiation.",
        "Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks generated via the crosslinking of hydrophilic polymers, which have the capability of absorbing and retaining large amounts of water causing the hydrogel to swell [58,59,60]. Hydrogels are used as scaffolds to provide support for cell differentiation and maturation by partially mimicking the properties of the ECM [61,62]. There are two broad types of hydrogels: natural and synthetic. Natural hydrogels are derived from naturally occurring polymers such as collagen, fibrin, and gelatin. Synthetic hydrogels are produced from synthetic polymers like polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol [60].",
        "Hydrogel formation may involve different crosslinking mechanisms, developing physical or chemical bonds between polymer chains that create a three-dimensional network [63]. Crosslinking plays a crucial role in the generation of hydrogels as it influences their biological, mechanical and chemical properties [64,65]. The crosslinks, whether physical or chemical, affect the elasticity, degradability, porosity and strength of the hydrogel [66]. The distinction between chemical and physical crosslinking lies in the nature of the bonds that hold the hydrogel together [66,67]. Physical crosslinking involves interactions such as van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, or ionic interactions and crystallite formation [68], whereas chemical crosslinking involves covalent bonds formed between the polymer chains, resulting in a stronger, stable and permanent network.",
        "Physical crosslinking can be reversible, meaning that the hydrogels can respond to environmental changes such as pH levels, temperature, or ionic strength [69]. Physical crosslinking is also biocompatible and less toxic, making it desirable in biomedical applications. Self-assembling hydrogels form spontaneously noncovalent bonds like van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds [70]. Individual hydrogen bonds are relatively weak interactions but when multiple hydrogen bonding occurs it can form the intricate networks characteristic of hydrogels. Natural hydrogel-forming polymers such as collagen, starch, agar, and gelatin can build extensive hydrogen bonding networks [60,69,71]. However, hydrogels that are crosslinked via hydrogen bonding alone have disadvantages such as weak mechanical strength. As such, hydrogen bonding can be combined with other methods of crosslinking to generate mechanically stronger hydrogels [71]. Hydrophobic interactions lead to significant water absorption and swelling, essential for the formation of hydrogel structures. Hydrogels made from chitosan, for example, are typically prepared using this method of hydrophobic interaction [60,72]. Hydrogels can also be formed from ionic and electrostatic interactions, which occur between oppositely charged groups by electrostatic force [71]. Alginate, a polysaccharide containing mannuronic and glucuronic acid, forms crosslinks with divalent cations such as calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and barium (Ba2+). These cations bind to alginate’s glucuronate blocks, creating gel structures that can be used in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, wound healing, and tissue engineering [73]. While ionic–electrostatic interactions enable the hydrogels to self-repair, allowing them to reform after high stress, this crosslinking method limits the mechanical strength of the hydrogels [65]. A physical crosslinking technique widely used for both natural and synthetic polymers is the freeze–thawing method [74]. As seen in the production of poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) this process leads to the formation of crystallites acting as crosslinking sites in the polymer matrix eventually forming hydrogel structures [75].",
        "Chemical crosslinking in hydrogels involves the formation of covalent bonds between polymer chains [76]. These bonds can be generated by incorporating functional monomers into the polymer matrix, or by joining together the carboxyl (-COOH), hydroxyl (-OH), or amino (-NH2) groups of polymer chains via crosslinking agents such as aldehydes [77]. These reactions form stable covalent bonds that define the structure and properties of the hydrogel network. Nevertheless, aldehydes are toxic, affecting the hydrogel’s biocompatibility [76]. Enzymatic crosslinking is an alternative approach in which enzymes such as tyrosinase, peroxidase or lysyl oxidase catalyse the crosslinking within polymer chains [77]. This is more advantageous as it is highly selective and only requires mild catalytic reactions without the need for toxic crosslinking agents [78]. Enzymatic crosslinking has facilitated the production of hydrogels sourced from various proteins, primarily collagen or gelatin. Additionally, it has become increasingly popular for injectable hydrogels due to their biocompatibility and ability to function under physiological conditions [79]. Enzymes typically function under conditions found in living organisms and, unlike many chemicals, are generally considered to be biologically compatible.",
        "There are two broad categories of hydrogels: natural and synthetic (Table 2 and Table 3). Natural hydrogels are derived from naturally occurring polymers such as collagen, fibrin, and gelatin and are highly biocompatible. Synthetic hydrogels are produced from synthetic polymers like polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol, possessing controllable and strong mechanical properties. These traits make both natural and synthetic hydrogels very attractive for cardiac tissue engineering [80].",
        "Natural and synthetic polymers both have their own unique advantages. Natural biomaterials are highly biocompatible and have a greater affinity for cells. However, they tend to have a weaker mechanical strength and degrade at a faster rate than synthetic polymers. On the other hand, synthetic polymers offer stronger mechanical properties than natural polymers but may not be as biocompatible [97]. To combine the strengths of both, hybrid hydrogels have been developed [97,100]. Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) is a hybrid hydrogel developed by combining methacrylic anhydride with gelatin [101]. It has gained popularity in cardiac tissue engineering due to its biocompatibility, high cell adhesion, and the ability to regulate its biodegradability [102]. In addition, the stiffness and strength of the hydrogel can be increased by adjusting the amount of methacrylic anhydride [103]. Recent and ongoing research into hybrid hydrogels has shifted its focus towards the incorporation of conductive nanomaterials, such as gold nanomaterials, graphene oxide (GO), or carbon nanotubes (CNTs). As the heart relies on electrical signals to function and coordinate heartbeats, the intrinsic electrically conductive properties of these materials can greatly enhance hydrogels for cardiac tissue regeneration [104,105]. For example, Li et al. incorporated polydopamine-reduced graphene oxide (PDA/rGO) into GelMA hydrogels. CMs were then seeded into this modified hydrogel, which showed an increase in cell survival rate and faster maturation compared to GelMA hydrogel alone. Moreover, CMs in the PDA/rGO hydrogel group exhibited an accelerated beating rate, attributed to the increased conductivity resulting from the addition of PDA/rGO [106].",
        "While hybrid hydrogels are a promising avenue for cardiac tissue regeneration, synthetic peptides have gained significant attention as they show properties of both natural macromolecules and synthetic polymers. To further advance tissue engineering, self-assembling peptide hydrogels (SAPHs) have been developed [107]. SAPHs represent a category of soft materials made from peptides and amino acids that function as fundamental building blocks. These hydrogels can entrap water or fluids within their molecular framework, transforming them into nanoscale hydrogel structures [94]. Utilising specific methods, peptides can be programmed to spontaneously self-assemble in aqueous conditions such as temperature, ionic strength, or pH [107]. SAPHs use various highly specific intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, electrostatic, ionic, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interactions, leading to the formation of different secondary structures such as α-helices and β-sheets [107,108]. These hydrogels are very tuneable and can be easily modified; they also provide ECM-like microenvironments, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, making them ideal for cardiac tissue engineering applications [109]. In a previous study, a SAPH modified with folic acid was created to differentiate iPSCs into cardiomyocytes in the hearts of mice that had suffered from an MI. The results showed that this modified SAPH enhanced the differentiation and survival of the iPSCs, leading to a reduction in fibrosis and increased cardiac function [110]. Another study by Burgess et al. investigated the cell adhesion functionalisation of the self-assembling peptides FEFEFKFK (F-phenylalanine; E: glutamic acid; K: lysine). This peptide can self-assemble into transparent and stable hydrogels [111,112,113]. To enhance its cell adhesion properties, they added the motif RGD (R: arginine; G: glycine; D: aspartic acid). Using the peptide RGDSP-FEFEFKFK (S: serine; P: proline), they developed a hydrogel scaffold that was used to inject rat cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), a cell type known for its regenerative properties, into rat hearts. This study showed that culturing the CPCs inside the hydrogel for the duration of one week stimulated their differentiation towards adult cardiac phenotypes. The hydrogel injection containing the CPCs significantly reduced the left ventricular dilation and myocardial damage in rats after suffering an MI [111]. Recently, a new SAPH was developed by modifying RADA16, a peptide capable of self-assembling into β-sheets [114], with a cell-adhesive motif (RGDSP) and a BMP-2-binding motif [115]. The functionalized SAPH was tested for its effects on cell adhesion, differentiation, and survival of MSCs. When transplanted into rat myocardial infarction models, the SAPH formed nanofibrous scaffolds that supported cell adhesion and protected MSCs under hypoxic conditions. As the SAPH degraded, it led to sustained BMP-2 release, promoting MSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes. Four weeks after transplantation there was significant improvement in myocardial regeneration, angiogenesis, and cardiac function, along with increased cardiomyocyte differentiation and gap junction formation. This study suggests that SAPHs that enhance BMP-2 release can promote cardiac tissue regeneration [115].",
        "Cardiac patches are scaffolds engineered to adhere to the heart’s surface following MI damage [116] (Figure 2). They mimic the native ECM and provide mechanical support while promoting cardiac tissue regeneration. To be able to withstand the heart’s systolic pressure cardiac patches must maintain high mechanical properties [117]. Additionally, they must integrate seamlessly into the native cardiomyocyte’s electric conduction to prevent arrhythmias [118]. Patient-specific human cardiac patches have been created using hiPSC-CMs and decellularized rat heart ECM. These patches demonstrated contractility and normal electrical response and improved heart function in an MI rat model [119]. It was also noted that the hiPSC-CMs survived longer than those used in studies where they were injected directly into the heart [119,120]. In an MI porcine model, a combination of hiPSC-CMs, endothelial cells (ECs), and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was co-injected, resulting in enhanced cell engraftment, improved myocardial wall stress, and contractility [121]. However, before cardiac patches can progress to clinical application, there are a number of obstacles that need to be overcome [122]. In a human heart, a cardiac patch needs to be of a certain size, large enough to cover the typical area of infarcted tissues. To address this, a cardiac patch with the appropriate dimensions of 4 cm × 2 cm × 1.25 mm was developed using hiPSC-CMs, SMCs, and ECs in a scaffold made from fibrin. In an MI porcine model, the patch significantly improved myocardial wall stress, decreased the size of the infarcted tissue area and improved overall cardiac function [123]. This shows the possibility of developing an effective cardiac patch with an increased size, that reflects the size required for a human heart.",
        "Vascularisation is another major obstacle faced by researchers developing cardiac patches. It is essential as it provides the ability for the cardiac patch to exchange oxygen, nutrients, and signals with the host cells [122]. Recently, a partially vascularised cardiac patch was developed by fabricating biomimetic microvessels (BMVs) that contained human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and incorporated them into a fibrin gel that consisted of human cardiac stem cells (CSCs). These fabricated BMVs closely mimicked the architecture and function of natural capillaries. In a rat MI model, the BMV–CSC patch showed a significant improvement in myocardial capillary density and an uptake of cardiomyocyte mitotic activity in the infarcted area [124]. The BMV–CSC patch’s ability to generate vascularized tissue-engineered structures is a promising advancement for cardiac tissue engineering.",
        "Injectable hydrogels are widely used in cardiac tissue engineering due to their strong permeability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability [125] (Figure 2). Once injected into the heart, the hydrogel will change from liquid to a gel via crosslinking [126]. For example, thermosensitive hydrogels are engineered to develop into a gel at body temperature [89]. Similarly, ionic hydrogels transition from a liquid to a gel state in response to pH changes, while photo crosslinked hydrogels will solidify upon exposure to light, usually UV [126]. Research has demonstrated that using hydrogels that can be injected is an effective way to improve cardiac function and CM retention [125]. They can also increase the thickness of the left ventricle wall and offer support to the myocardium, which promotes tissue regeneration [127]. Injectable hydrogels have already been tested in clinical trials. An injectable hydrogel made of acellular alginate was investigated using 27 patients who had previously suffered an MI. Data from an echocardiograph revealed preserved LVEF, indicating that the left ventricle was functioning well. No adverse effects were recorded [128]. However, a larger clinical trial was conducted where they injected alginate-based hydrogels into patients with severe heart failure. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in all the participant’s overall HF symptoms alongside an increase in their exercise performance. Despite this, within a 30-day period after the injection, 8.6% of patients died, whereas in the control group, no patients died [129], emphasising the need to further investigate the safety and biocompatibility of injectable hydrogels.",
        "Injectable hydrogels hold significant promise in cardiac regeneration, but several challenges need to be addressed. These hydrogels often exhibit low mechanical strength and carry the potential to trigger an immune reaction upon injection into the heart [126]. Additionally, the application of injectable hydrogels for heart treatment aims to minimise the need for open heart surgery and enhance their clinical significance. However, the implantation methods themselves may pose certain risks. One common method involves directly injecting the hydrogel into the myocardium through the epicardium. This approach, however, necessitates a large injection, making it highly invasive for the patient, alongside a thoracotomy which introduces surgical complications [129,130] (Figure 3). Trans-endocardial intramyocardial injections use a catheter to guide the hydrogel to the heart injury site and are considered safer and more precise in terms of injecting the hydrogel into the myocardium through the endocardium using a catheter and imaging technology. Nevertheless, this method requires hydrogels with very specific mechanical properties, which limits the availability of suitable biomaterials [131,132]. Instead, intracoronary injection is delivered through the main coronary artery, but it carries the risk of coronary artery obstruction or re-embolization of coronary arteries, thus limiting its clinical use [100,128]. Despite the comparative safety and reduced invasiveness of injectable hydrogels as opposed to cardiac patches, a safer method for delivering hydrogels via injection is still needed to advance their clinical applications.",
        "Organoids are scaled-down versions of organs and tissues, usually generated from stem cells, that create 3D structures which replicate to a degree the function and morphology of the original organ [133]. While these organoid constructs are still limited due to the complex nature of organs and tissues, they have proven effective in drug discovery, modelling diseases, and tissue engineering [132]. Scientists have successfully created cardiac organoid models, which have helped in understanding heart disease and provided a platform to study the biological mechanisms of human heart regeneration, bridging the gap between animal studies on MI and heart disease with human studies [134]. Cardiac organoids are still limited, due to their immaturity, lack of vascularisation, poor reproducibility, and a lack of structural features such as valves. As such, these organoids cannot fully replicate the adult human heart. Once these limitations are overcome, a variety of applications will be unlocked [135]. For instance, tissue generated from engineered cardiac organoids could potentially be transplanted into injured hearts post-MI to replace the damaged myocardium and restore cardiac function [136].",
        "In the field of cardiac organoids, 3D bioprinting is a promising innovation that is gaining popularity. It involves the layering of biomaterials to create a 3D structure that is controllable, customisable, and reproducible [137]. A key component of this process is bio-ink, commonly made up of hydrogels derived from natural or synthetic polymers. A bio-ink should meet several important criteria to be suitable for 3D printing applications [138]. It must be biocompatible to support cell viability and integration with living tissues. Additionally, it should possess robust mechanical strength and flexibility to adapt to the diverse mechanical and chemical requirements of different tissue types [138,139]. Recently, advanced bioactive bio-inks have been developed, incorporating cells such as adult stem cells or iPSCs within them prior to printing. This allows for a more precise distribution of cells within the 3D structure [138,139,140].",
        "While 3D bioprinting has been effective in tissue engineering for hard tissues such as bone, it is still limited regarding soft materials such as hydrogels and more complete structures like the heart [141]. There are four main bioprinting techniques that vary based on their mechanisms, applications, and resolutions (Table 4) (Figure 4). Droplet-based bioprinting employs bio-printers that continuously deposit biomaterials, bio-inks, or cell-laden droplets to construct 2D or 3D structures. It has high precision, achieving resolutions of up to 50 μm, but struggles with printing highly viscous bio-inks [142,143]. Laser-assisted bioprinting uses a high-intensity laser to propel biomaterial droplets onto a substrate containing cell culture medium. This method requires a ribbon composed of transparent glass, a thin metal layer, and a biomaterial layer, where laser pulses vaporise the metal layer, generating a high-pressure bubble to eject droplets with exceptional precision, achieving resolutions as fine as 5 μm [144,145]. Stereolithography (SLA) and digital light processing (DLP) rely on light-sensitive polymers to fabricate intricate structures. These techniques use either a UV laser beam (SLA) or digital light sources like UV (DLP) to cure liquid photocrosslinkable bio-inks, enabling the creation of highly detailed constructs [146]. Finally, extrusion-based bioprinting stands out as the most commonly used technique due to its simplicity, affordability, and scalability. It employs a computer-controlled system to extrude bio-inks or biomaterials through a nozzle using a pressure system, creating 3D structures layer by layer [147]. While its resolution, at approximately 200 μm, is lower compared to other methods, extrusion-based bioprinting is highly versatile, capable of printing higher cell densities and more viscous bio-inks, and offers better structural integrity through the continuous deposition of filaments. Despite its limitations, extrusion-based bioprinting remains the most popular method due to its practicality in producing larger-scale constructs [148]. In addition, the Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH) is an emerging extrusion-based bioprinting technique, where hydrogel bio-inks are extruded within a thermo-reversible support medium. This technique aims to address challenges faced when developing soft, complex structures such as the heart [149]. A study introduced an optimised version of the bioprinting technique called FRESH v2.0, which significantly enhanced resolution, enabling the creation of collagen filaments with a resolution of 20 μm in diameter. Using this advanced approach, researchers successfully bioprinted a neonatal-scale human heart using type I collagen bio-ink as a scaffold. To allow for the observation of internal structures, they printed only half of the heart, showcasing intricate features such as trabeculae, atrial and ventricular chambers, and pulmonary and aortic valves [150]. This highlights how bio-inks and advanced 3D bioprinting techniques, such as extrusion-based bioprinting, can be used to generate functional cardiac tissue, offering a promising approach for advancing research in cardiac regeneration and developing effective therapies to repair and regenerate heart tissue damaged by MI.",
        "There is an urgent clinical need for effective novel therapies to treat MI. Various cell types, such as adult stem cells and pluripotent stem cells, show potential for therapeutic application [151]. However, their success depends on the development of suitable scaffolds that can support cell growth and differentiation while also ensuring biological compatibility. Hydrogels offer a promising possibility as a scaffold to support cells in the regeneration of damaged cardiac tissue after an MI [152]. Researchers have faced challenges in developing hydrogels tailored specifically for heart regeneration [55], since they must be meticulously designed to accommodate the mechanical and electrical properties of the heart while also being able to withstand the strong contractions generated by the cardiac muscle [103].",
        "Natural-based hydrogels have proven to be effective in cardiac regeneration due to their ability to mimic the ECM, their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and their very low cytotoxicity, making them suitable for clinical application [153]. Unfortunately, they possess low stability, weak mechanical strength, and rapid degradation in vivo [154]. Conversely, synthetic hydrogels have more controllable features and strong mechanical properties, which provide structural support for the cells, but they have poor biocompatible and biodegradation properties. Some synthetic polymers can be modified through alteration of their functional groups or by combining them with natural polymers to improve their weaker biocompatibility [155], and the development of these hybrid hydrogels along with the incorporation of conductive nanomaterials has led to a significant advancement in cardiac tissue regeneration.",
        "Hydrogels in cardiac tissue regeneration have various delivery methods. Injectable hydrogels are an innovative, minimally invasive approach. They respond to temperature, light, and pH [156], becoming more adaptable after injection. Moreover, incorporation of conductive materials further improves their electrical integration [104]. The advancement of injectable hydrogels has been revolutionary in cardiac tissue regeneration; however, they are affected by poor mechanical force transmission [89] which is being addressed by shear thinning, a technique resulting in increased mechanical strength and stiffness, as well as improved self-healing properties [157]. Nevertheless, to further develop the regenerative capabilities of injectable hydrogels, more novel studies are needed to address the injection application, degradation rate, low survival, and the retention of therapeutic cells.",
        "Hydrogel-based cardiac patches also show promising potential in cardiac tissue repair, especially after an MI. Once integrated with the host, they can deliver therapeutic cells to repair damage in the myocardium. However, limited full electrical integration with the damaged myocardium, immune rejection, and potential surgical complications during transplantation to the heart [116,117,158] limit their therapeutic application. Notably, a novel injectable conductive cardio patch was developed using methacrylated gelatin and elastin, along with CNTs. The remarkable feature of this patch is that it can re-form its original shape post-injection. Tests in rats and minipigs demonstrated significant improvement in cardiac function post-MI [159]. More importantly, this study utilised CNTs to produce cardiac patches that were electrically conductive, a feature not seen in previous research [159]. This breakthrough can lead to the development of an injectable minimally invasive cardiac patch with improved conductive properties. This further highlights the possibilities an injectable cardiac patch could have for post-MI treatment in a clinical setting.",
        "Bioprinting has emerged as an innovative technology with the ability to create and develop 3D structures made from various biomaterials. Its potential applications have garnered significant attention, particularly when combined with stem cells [138,160,161]. The ability to fabricate heart tissue through bioprinting holds promise for addressing heart disease and tissue damage, but there are still numerous challenges that must first be addressed and overcome to ensure its success in clinical applications. These obstacles involve the printing techniques, the bio-inks, the mechanical strength of printed 3D structures, cell viability, and vascularisation. In addition, the bio-inks also need improvements in compatibility, stiffnesses, integrin signalling, and cell motility [162]. A promising area of future research in bioprinting is 4D bioprinting, an advanced technique that combines 3D bioprinting technology with smart materials capable of changing their properties or shapes in response to external stimuli. These materials are engineered to react to factors such as pH, light, temperature, or electric and magnetic fields, enabling dynamic and responsive changes in the printed structures over time [163]. In 4D bioprinting, hydrogels play a crucial role as they can be designed to undergo these stimuli-driven changes, making them particularly suitable for biomedical applications. This innovative approach is especially significant in cardiac regeneration, where it enables the creation of scaffolds that can adapt to the heart’s dynamic environment, respond to biomechanical cues, and promote tissue growth and repair [164]. By mimicking the heart’s native behaviour and adapting to its changing conditions, 4D bioprinting offers the potential for advancing research in cardiac regeneration and improving therapies for MI [161].",
        "In summary, synthetic and natural hydrogels possess unique qualities that can provide a supporting environment, enhancing the differentiation and maturation of implanted cells. Hydrogels can be used in various applications such as cardiac patches, injectable hydrogels and 3D bioprinting, which can help promote cardiac tissue regeneration. Although these methods have great potential, some refinement is needed before proceeding to clinical applications.",

        "Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide [1,2]. Heart transplantation is currently the only effective treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure, but the severe shortage of donor hearts poses a major challenge. While progress has recently been made in xenotransplantation [3], its application in humans has so far failed, and we are still far from achieving successful clinical implementation [4]. Similarly, stem cell therapies have not been successful [5]. The approach of inducing cardiomyocyte proliferation presents limitations, with its efficacy in adult hearts still being unclear [6]. In recent years, engineered cardiac tissues have emerged as valuable tools for modeling disease and studying drug responses. Preclinical animal studies suggested that engineered cardiac tissues can improve heart function [1,[7], [8], [9], [10]], and their suitability for patients is currently being evaluated in a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04396899). The clinical trial aims to test the hypothesis that cardiomyocyte implantation using an engineered heart muscle (EHM), the proposed investigational medicinal product (IMP) known as \"Biological ventricular assist tissue\" or BioVAT, can lead to sustainable remuscularization and improve myocardial function in patients with heart failure. The engineered heart muscle are created from a precise mixture of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells, encapsulated in a bovine collagen type I hydrogel. Extensive preclinical testing has supported the clinical viability of this myocardial remuscularization approach via the EHM implantation. The trial targets patients with advanced heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; EF ≤ 35 %), who have no viable options for heart transplantation (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04396899). Moreover, Jebran et al. [11] investigated the use of epicardial EHM allografts made from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells to treat heart failure in rhesus macaques. The goal was to achieve structural and functional remuscularization of the failing heart without severe side effects like arrhythmia and tumor growth. The researchers confirmed that the new rhesus macaque EHM model was comparable to an established human EHM formulation [11]. Long-term retention of EHM grafts (up to 6 months) and dose-dependent enhancement of the heart wall were demonstrated, including improvements in heart contractility and ejection fraction. The EHM allografts were shown to be safe, as no arrhythmias or tumors were observed. Histopathological and magnetic resonance imaging analyses confirmed cell retention and vascularization. These findings led to the approval of a first-in-human clinical trial, where EHM implantation successfully remuscularized the heart in a patient with advanced heart failure [11]. Cardiac tissue engineering (cardiac TE) stands at the forefront of biomedical research, driven by the imperative to address challenges posed by traditional methodologies [12,13].",
        "The cardiovascular system, with its complex network of blood vessels including arteries, veins and capillaries, along with the heart muscle and valves, is susceptible to various pathologies and injuries that need advanced strategies for effective tissue repair [[14], [15], [16]]. Traditional approaches to cardiovascular TE, such as the use of synthetic grafts and the injection or transplantation of cells directly into the damaged heart tissue, face significant challenges [17]. Synthetic grafts, while widely used, often lack the intricate cellular and extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture necessary for optimal functionality and integration within the host tissue [18]. Furthermore, cardiac cell injection and cell transplantation for regenerating cardiac tissue functions and properties face several limitations that hinder their efficacy and practical clinical application [19,20]. One significant challenge is the low survival rate of transplanted cells, often due to the hostile environment of the infarcted heart, characterized by inflammation, hypoxia, and oxidative stress. This environment can cause rapid cell death, reducing the overall therapeutic potential [21]. Immunogenicity is another concern, as the immune system may reject the transplanted cells, especially if they are allogeneic rather than autologous [22]. Furthermore, the lack of appropriate vascularization at the damaged heart site where cells are introduced, can impede nutrient and oxygen supply, compromising cell survival and function [23,24]. The newly introduced cells often struggle to establish strong connections with existing myocardial cells, leading to poor mechanical and electrical coupling. This lack of integration disrupts the synchronized contraction of the heart muscle, crucial for effective blood pumping [25]. This increases the risk of arrhythmias, which are life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms. The difference in electrical properties between the transplanted cells and native myocardium worsens this issue, as the transplanted cells may fail to propagate electrical signals efficiently or synchronously [25,26].",
        "Due to tissue complex microstructure and limited regenerative capacity, the human heart struggles to repair itself after injury [5,27]. Myocardial infarction often leads to non-functional scar tissue formation, distorting tissue structure, increasing stiffness, and reducing contractility, which impaires cardiac function [28]. The normal pumping action of the heart causes deformation, leading to remodeling and reduced cardiac output over time. Despite lots of efforts, complete elimination of scar tissue and restoration of cardiac output to pre-myocardial infarction levels remain elusive [29]. Additionally, coordinated interactions among cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and other cell types are crucial for proper cardiac function. Traditional methods often falter in recreating this intricate cellular environment, which hinders the seamless integration of engineered tissues with the native cardiac milieu [30,31]. Traditional methods often struggle to induce proper vascularization within engineered tissues [18,32,33]. Similarly, integrating the necessary neural innervation for proper cardiac function presents an additional challenge. The intricate interplay between the autonomic nervous system and the myocardium is crucial for physiological control [34,35]. Moreover, traditional regenerative strategies encounter difficulties in mimicking the biomechanical properties of native myocardium. Achieving optimal scaffold design and material selection to withstand the cyclic mechanical stresses remains a persistent challenge, affecting the functionality and long-term stability of engineered tissues [36,37].",
        "The multidisciplinary field of cardiac TE integrates principles from biology, medicine, chemistry, biophysics, materials science and engineering, to develop advanced strategies for repairing or replacing damaged cardiovascular tissues [[37], [38], [39]]. Mechanically, TE scaffolds should possess strength and elasticity mimicking the heart muscles, providing structural support while accommodating dynamic contractions and expansions [40,41]. Additionally, biocompatibility is paramount to ensure that the scaffold does not elicit an adverse immune response, thereby promoting cellular adhesion, proper cell functions such as contractions and maturation [18,41]. Tuned biodegradability is another crucial feature; some scaffolds are designed to degrade at a rate that matches tissue regeneration, ensuring they provide temporary support without causing long-term complications or requiring removal [42]. Moreover, anisotropy, reflecting the directional dependency of mechanical properties, is essential to guide the alignment of cardiomyocytes, promoting the formation of functional and contractile tissue [43,44]. To design scaffolds approaching cardiac tissue functionalities, advanced biofabrication techniques such as 3D (bio)printing and electrospinning can be combined. The tissue engineering of cardiac tissue, with heart intricate architecture and network of vessels, along with its diverse cell types and dynamic mechanical forces, requires a level of precision typically provided by 3D (bio)printing technologies when designing 3D cardiac bioconstructs [[45], [46], [47]]. 3D printing enables the precise layer-by-layer deposition of materials as inks, allowing for the fabrication of intricately designed structures that mimic the complex architecture of native tissues [48,49]. In the field of cardiovascular TE, 3D printing offers remarkable control over scaffold geometry and porosity, essential factors influencing cell adhesion, proliferation, and overall tissue integration [[48], [49], [50]]. The ability to customize cell/biomaterial scaffolds based on patient-specific anatomical data holds great promise, paving the way for personalized regenerative therapies to more effectively enhance patient care and improve quality of life [51,52]. Moreover, 3D (bio)printing can play a crucial role in the integration of electrically conductive biomaterials into the tissue. This technological process enables the precise layering of materials, allowing for the strategic placement of electrically conductive elements and cells within the polymer-based structured scaffold. Electrically conductive materials, such as metal nanoparticles and carbon-based nanomaterials, impart a set of properties to the electroactive engineered tissues [[53], [54], [55]]. They enable the transmission of electrical signals, fostering synchronized cell communication and enhancing the functionality of the regenerated cardiovascular tissues [53,56]. In addition to 3D printing, electrospinning plays a pivotal role in fabricating functional fiber/hydrogels for cardiac TE, offering a versatile and effective approach to fabricate biomimetic scaffolds with tailored properties [[57], [58], [59], [60]]. Electrospinning enables the production of nanofibrous structures which can mimic the ECM fiber reinforcement [61]. Furthermore, this innovative technique allows for precise control over fiber diameter, alignment, and overall fibrous scaffold architecture, thereby facilitating the development of functional patches or implants for applications in regenerative medicine [61,62]. In tandem with these biofabrication technologies, bioactive hydrogels have emerged as a cornerstone in cardiovascular TE [63]. Hydrogels, owing to their high-water content and biocompatibility, provide an ideal environment for cell encapsulation and proliferation. The integration of bioactive components, such as growth factors, peptides, ECM-mimicking molecules, or even bioactive polymers, further enhances the regenerative potential of these hydrogels [64,65]. The bioactive functionalities contributes to create a microenvironment conducive to cellular cues, orchestrating signaling pathways that guide tissue development and maturation [66,67]. The potential synergy between advancing fabrication technology and hydrogels is highly promising [68,69].",
        "The originality of this review lies in the thorough examination of 3D printing and electrospinning technologies for designing electroconductive biopolymer-based hydrogels for cardiac TE applications. While both fabrication techniques are mainly independently studied in this work, it also emphasizes the combined potential of these techniques to fabricate scaffolds that replicate the microstructural, functionality, including mechanical and electrical properties of native cardiac tissues. Additionally, the review highlights how incorporating electroconductive materials into biopolymer-based hydrogels enhances cell-to-cell communication and electrical coupling as well assupport cardiomyocyte maturation. The review discusses recent studies on the use of 3D printing and/or electrospinning to engineer the electroconductive hydrogels for cardiac TE. The interplay between electrical conductivity and other bioactive functionalities in electroconductive composite hydrogels is explored. The role of 3D (bio)printing and electrospinning, their advantages, limitations, and applications in designing electrically conductive biopolymer composite hydrogels is discussed, while providing insights into these biofabrication technologies. The review also highlights the electrically conductive materials and biopolymers commonly used in the design of electroactive hydrogels, focusing on their properties, characteristics, and significance.",
        "The architecture of cardiac tissue is defined by a meticulously organized and interconnected network of cells that serves as the cornerstone of the heart remarkable rhythmic contractility and its crucial function in pumping blood throughout the body [70]. In terms of volume, mainly consisting of cardiomyocytes, the cardiac tissue is organized to ensure the seamless integration of electrical conduction and mechanical contraction [70,71]. The alignment of cardiomyocytes into myocardial fibers, layered in a precise pattern, facilitates synchronized contraction, optimizing the heart ability to generate the force needed for effective blood circulation [72,73].",
        "The myocardium serves as the essential structural muscle layer of the heart, playing a crucial role in coordinating cardiac function (Fig. 1A). This cardiac muscle layer constitutes the thickest portion of the heart wall, encompassing the muscular substance responsible for the forceful contractions that propel blood throughout the circulatory system [74]. These elongated cells exhibit a remarkable degree of organization and coordination to ensure the synchronous contraction essential for efficient cardiac performance [75]. The cellular arrangement in the myocardium allows for optimal force generation while maintaining the structural integrity required to withstand the continuous mechanical demands of the cardiac cycle. Within the cardiac muscle fiber, the myofibril emerges as the fundamental structural unit responsible for contractility. These thread-like structures extend longitudinally throughout the entire length of the cardiac muscle cell, housing the contractile machinery necessary for myocardial function [76,77]. The myofibril is characterized by a striated appearance, a result of the orderly arrangement of contractile proteins within its structure. Comprising the myofibril are sarcomeres, the smallest functional units of the cardiac muscle (Fig. 1A). These repeating units encapsulate the actin and myosin filaments responsible for the intricate process of muscle contraction [78]. The harmonious interplay of these contractile filaments is regulated by the controlled release of calcium ions, a process fundamental to the myocardium ability to contract rhythmically and efficiently [79]. The composition of the cardiac muscle fiber extends beyond its contractile apparatus to encompass specialized intercellular structures known as intercalated discs. These discs facilitate mechanical and electrical coupling between adjacent cardiac muscle fibers, ensuring the coordinated contraction essential for the heart pump function [75,76]. Comprising desmosomes and gap junctions, intercalated discs contribute to the myocardium unique ability to contract as a synchronized unit [80]. The intrinsic characteristics that collectively enable the heart to efficiently pump blood are contractility, elasticity, and conductivity [81]. Contractility relies on the myofibrillar machinery, while elasticity ensures the myocardium prompt recoil after contraction, allowing for optimal blood filling during the diastolic phase [82]. In addition, the conductivity of cardiac muscle fibers ensures the propagation of electrical signals, maintaining the rhythmicity and synchronization necessary for a coordinated heartbeat [26].Fig. 1(A) Structure of cardiac muscle fiber and sarcomeres−the functional units of muscle contraction.

        "The various cell types of cardiac tissue contribute uniquely to the structural integrity and functional harmony of the heart (Fig. 1B) [76]. Cardiomyocytes are responsible cells for the forceful contractions that propel blood throughout the circulatory system [83]. Interspersed among them are fibroblasts, which play a crucial role in maintaining the structural framework of the heart by synthesizing and organizing the ECM [84]. The endothelial cells, which form the inner lining of blood vessels, provide a seamless microenvironment for nutrient and oxygen exchange [31]. Furthermore, smooth muscle cells, found in the walls of blood vessels, regulate vascular tone and blood flow. Moreover, the conduction system cells, including pacemaker cells, orchestrate the electrical impulses that synchronize and regulate the rhythmic contractions of the heart [85]. In addition, single-cell RNA-seq experiments revealed that around 5 % of the cells in the heart are macrophages. Furthermore, it has been shown that macrophages contribute to the electrical coupling of cardiomyocytes [86].",
        "Beyond the singular alignment of cardiomyocytes, the parallely arranged myocardial fibers are artfully organized in distinct layers, each strategically oriented at different angles. This multi-layered architectural design serves as evidence of heart adaptability, optimizing its mechanical performance to meet the dynamic demands inherent in the rhythmic pumping of blood during each cardiac cycle [87,88]. The innermost layer, the endocardium, comprises endothelial cells lining the heart chambers, ensuring smooth blood flow (Fig. 1C). In the myocardium, the middle layer of the heart, cardiomyocytes rhythmically contract to pump blood throughout the circulatory system [76]. The epicardium, which is the outermost layer of the heart, is primarily composed of epicardial cells. These cells form a thin, protective layer that covers the surface of the heart (Fig. 1C). The ECM, rich in collagen and elastin, provides structural support and regulates heart elasticity. Additionally, blood vessels and nerves contribute to the overall complexity of cardiac tissue, forming a cohesive and dynamic structure essential for cardiac function (Fig. 1C) [76].",
        "The ECM of cardiac tissue, which forms the structural framework of the heart (Fig. 1B), is constituted of an intricate interplay of proteins, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides. The ECM is not merely a passive scaffold but a dynamic entity that profoundly influences cellular behavior, tissue architecture, and overall cardiac function (Fig. 1B) [89]. Collagen is a key component of the cardiac ECM, forming a dense, organized matrix that provides tensile strength to the myocardium. Its fibers align in parallel with the orientation of cardiac muscle fibers, contributing to the mechanical integrity of the heart. Specifically, this collagen network not only provides tensile strength but also facilitates the transmission of mechanical signals to the cells, which is essential for proper cardiac function [54,90,91]. Elastin is another crucial protein within the cardiac ECM, imparting elasticity to cardiac tissues. This elasticity is essential for accommodating the dynamic movements of the heart, allowing it to stretch and recoil with each heartbeat. Elastin contributes to the resilience of blood vessels, heart valves, and the myocardium itself, influencing overall cardiac performance [92]. Proteoglycans, composed of a core protein and glycosaminoglycan chains, constitute a significant portion of the cardiac ECM. These molecules confer water-retaining properties to the matrix, contributing to its hydration and lubrication. This hydrated ECM facilitates nutrient exchange and serves as a reservoir for various signaling molecules, influencing cellular activities and maintaining tissue homeostasis [15,93]. Glycoproteins such as fibronectin and laminin play pivotal roles as adhesion molecules within the cardiac ECM. They establish connections between cells and the surrounding matrix, influencing crucial cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and signaling [94]. The cardiac ECM undergoes constant remodeling, a process where cells deposit and degrade matrix components. This remodeling is essential for adapting to mechanical forces, responding to injury, and facilitating tissue regeneration. However, dysregulated ECM remodeling is implicated in various cardiovascular pathologies, including myocardial infarction and heart failure [95].",
        "The intricacies of cardiac tissue architecture are fundamentally intertwined with its electroconductive properties, a dynamic interplay that orchestrates the synchronized contraction essential for effective cardiac function [96]. At the core of this complex system are cardiomyocytes, the specialized muscle cells of the heart, whose coordinated activity is meticulously regulated by precisely timed electrical signals. Cardiac cells communicate with remarkable precision through a complex network of intercellular connections known as gap junctions [25]. These microscopic channels facilitate direct communication between adjacent cardiomyocytes, enabling the seamless transmission of electrical signals. This interconnected web of gap junctions serves as the communication highway for rapid signal propagation, ensuring that the entire myocardium contracts and relaxes in unison [97,98]. The electroconductive nature of cardiac tissue is intricately linked to the movement of ions across cell membranes, a process governed by specialized proteins known as ion channels [99]. These channels are embedded within the cell membrane and act as gatekeepers, regulating the influx and efflux of ions such as sodium, potassium, and calcium [100,101]. The orchestrated opening and closing of these ion channels generate electrical impulses known as action potentials. As the action potential initiates in one cardiomyocyte, it rapidly propagates through the gap junctions, transmitting the electrical signal to neighboring cells [102]. This phenomenon leads to the coordinated depolarization and subsequent repolarization of each cell, creating a cascade of events that results in the rhythmic electrical activity fundamental to proper heart function. The synchronized contraction and relaxation of cardiomyocytes, driven by these precisely orchestrated electrical signals, culminate in the pumping action of the heart [102,103]. The concept of electroconductivity within cardiac tissue goes beyond being a passive attribute; instead, it represents an active and dynamic process essential for orchestrating the intricate coordination of electrical impulses, ensuring the heart's efficient and synchronized pumping. This complex interplay involving cellular communication, ion movement, and harmonized electrical activity is fundamental to cardiac physiology. It serves as the foundation for comprehending and developing interventions in the fields of cardiovascular health and regenerative medicine [[104], [105], [106]].",
        "The heart as a muscular organ, relies on a precisely regulated electrical signal to coordinate the contraction and relaxation of its chambers [25,107]. The initiation of the cardiac electrical signal occurs in the sinoatrial node, often referred to as the heart natural pacemaker. Specialized pacemaker cells generate rhythmic electrical impulses, establishing the heart baseline rate [108,109]. These impulses propagate through the atria, causing them to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. The electrical signal then encounters the atrioventricular node, where there is a momentary delay, allowing the ventricles to fill completely [110]. Subsequently, the signal travels through the His bundle and its branches, reaching the Purkinje fibers, consisting of specialized cardiomyocytes with fewer myofibrils and many mitochondria, that spread throughout the ventricles, initiating their contraction [111]. The electroconductive properties of cardiac tissue are vital for the seamless transmission of these electrical signals. This conductivity allows for the rapid and coordinated depolarization of cardiomyocyte cells [112,113]. Disruptions in the electroconductive properties can lead to a range of cardiac disorders, particularly arrhythmias. In the field of cardiovascular TE, replicating the native architecture and electroconductive features of cardiac tissue is an important goal. There is a need to fabricate engineered structures that not only mimic the structural complexity of the heart, but also possess functional electroconductive properties to facilitate proper electrical signaling [55,60,90,114,115]. To achieve this goal, scientists are actively exploring innovative approaches, including the utilization 3D (bio)printing and electrospinning techniques for fabricating functional biomimetic hydrogel scaffolds for cardiac repair [116,117]. These scaffolds often incorporate a combination of natural and synthetic materials, offering structural support and cues for cellular alignment and proliferation [49,90,118].",
        "3D printing technologies such as inkjet-based printing, extrusion-based printing, stereolithography, selective laser sintering, fused deposition modeling, and laser-assisted printing, along with electrospinning technology, are commonly employed in the fabrication of hydrogels for cardiac TE [41,119]. These technologies allow the fabrication of 3D structures with precise control over spatial organization and geometric intricacies, offering the opportunity to customize hydrogel properties for biomedical applications [41,120]. Fig. 2 illustrates advanced 3D printing technologies, including laser-based stereolithography, digital light projection (DLP) systems, selective laser sintering (SLS), fused deposition modeling (FDM), inkjet-based printing, extrusion-based printing, and laser-assisted printing (LAB) for fabricating complex 3D functional structures. In the field of 3D printing, the used material used must satisfy specific criteria as apropriate viscosity, flow behavior, high resolution, precision, biocompatibility and stability of 3D printed object. The required properties of the ink differ from one technology to another, as each printing method demands distinct material behavior during deposition, gelation/solidification, or curing processes [41,48,64]. In biofabrication, in addition to the 3D printing technologies, the appropriate setup for electrospinning of nanofibers should be accordingly designed.Fig. 23D printing and electrospinning technologies: (A) laser-based stereolithography, (B) digital light projection (DLP), (C) selective laser sintering (SLS), (D) fused deposition modeling (FDM), (E) inkjet-based printing, (F) extrusion-based printing (EBB), (G) laser-assisted printing (LAB).

        "Stereolithography (SLA), a precise and advanced 3D printing technique, has found profound applications in the fabrication of hydrogels for cardiovascular TE. In the SLA process, a liquid photopolymer resin is selectively exposed to a laser or ultraviolet (UV) light in a controlled pattern using a laser (Fig. 2A) or a digital light source (Fig. 2B). The photopolymerization process in SLA can potentially compromise the viability of encapsulated cells. The resin should have a carefully controlled viscosity, typically ranging from 100 to 1000 mPa s, to ensure smooth flow and consistent recoating, while preventing excessive spreading [123]. The high resolution inherent in SLA is advantageous for the replication of the complex cardiac microarchitecture. The smooth surface finish of SLA-generated constructs seems to reduce the risk of thrombosis, making them suitable for cardiovascular tissue regeneration [124,125]. Furthermore, SLA allows for the creation of bioartifitial blood vessels that closely mimic the intricate network found in the heart, fostering improved nutrient delivery and waste removal within engineered cardiac tissues [123,126,127]. The choice of suitable biocompatible materials for SLA can be limited. Cardiac TE often requires materials with specific mechanical and biological properties, and not all resins used in SLA may meet these criteria [123,128].",
        "Selective laser sintering (SLS) is also a 3D printing technology that provides a versatile and precise approach for fabricating cardiovascular TE hydrogels [129]. In SLS, a high-powered laser selectively fuses powdered materials, typically polymers or metals, layer upon layer, based on a 3D digital model (Fig. 2C). The polymers typically used are polyamide or thermoplastic elastomers. A key requirement is the uniformity and control of the particle size distribution, ensuring that the powder maintains a consistent size within this range. This balance is essential for optimizing flowability, packing density, and sintering behavior, while also enabling high resolution in the printed layers [130,131]. Sufficient flowability is essential for consistent powder spreading and preventing recoater clogging, influenced by particle shape, size distribution, and surface treatment. efficient post-processing is reqired to remove loose powder and achieve the desired surface finish and dimensional accuracy for the final part [[132], [133], [134]]. A noteworthy advantage of SLS lies in its capacity to craft 3D scaffolds tailored for cardiac regeneration, featuring a precisely controlled and interconnected porous structure [135,135,136]. SLS supports a wide range of materials suitable for cardiac engineering applications [132,137]. Furthermore, SLS-produced cardiac constructs often exhibit good mechanical strength. This property is vital for maintaining structural integrity during implantation and ensuring that the construct can withstand physiological forces within the cardiovascular environment [138,139]. Yeong et al. [129] used SLS technology to fabricate a porous polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold. The sintered PCL strut exhibited a tensile stiffness of 0.43 ± 0.15 MPa. The scaffold had a porosity of 85 %, with pores of 40–100 μm [129]. C2C12 myoblast cells were cultured on the scaffold at a high cell density of 1.2 × 106 cells/mL. Cell fusion and differentiation were confirmed by myosin heavy chain immunostaining. This study demonstrated the successful application of SLS technology for tailoring high-performance scaffolds for cardiac TE applications [129]. Moreover, SLS is amenable to scaling up production without compromising precision. This scalability is crucial for potential clinical applications, allowing the fabrication of larger constructs suitable for transplantation or other therapeutic interventions [131,140]. While SLS offers impressive resolution, it may not achieve the level of precision provided by some other 3D printing techniques. This limitation may impact the fabrication of very fine features within the cardiac constructs [141]. Proper removal of residual powder after the sintering process is important for not affecting biocompatibility, which may require additional post-processing steps to ensure the construct suitability for biological applications as well as to enhance the mechanical properties of the construct [141].",
        "Fused deposition modeling (FDM) has emerged as a versatile 3D printing technology that involves layer-by-layer extrusion of thermoplastic filaments (Fig. 2D), with notable applications in the fabrication of TE cardiovascular constructs. In FDM, the material, typically a thermoplastic filament, must possess specific characteristics to ensure successful 3D printing and optimal performance of finished parts. A key requirement is a well-defined melting point, allowing for smooth extrusion through the heated nozzle while ensuring the filament solidifies quickly upon cooling to maintain the integrity of the printed structure [142,143]. Moreover, the extruded filament must exhibit adequate mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, impact resistance, and stiffness, to meet the functional demands of the final part. Additionally, it should have low hygroscopicity to avoid moisture absorption, which can cause problems like bubbling or weak interlayer bonding, compromising the print quality. Domínguez-Robles et al. [144] explored the use of FDM 3D printing to fabricate thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-based tubular cardiovascular grafts with antiplatelet properties. Dipyridamole (DIP) was incorporated into TPU filaments via hot-melt extrusion. The 3D-printed grafts exhibited sustained DIP release for 30 days [144]. The inclusion of 5 % DIP significantly reduced platelet adhesion compared to pristine TPU, while higher DIP concentrations increased surface roughness and platelet adhesion. Biocompatibility tests showed that 5 % DIP-loaded TPU promoted higher HUVEC proliferation than pristine TPU. Additionally, double-layered grafts combining DIP-loaded TPU with rifampicin-loaded TPU displayed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli [144]. FDM accommodates a wide range of thermoplastic materials, offering researchers the flexibility to tailor constructs with diverse mechanical properties suited for cardiac applications [145]. However, achieving high resolutions with FDM can be challenging, potentially impacting the precision of intricate features within 3D fabricated constructs [146]. While the thermoplastic materials may provide suitable mechanical properties, they might lack the necessary biological properties required for cardiac tissue regeneration. Finding materials that meet both mechanical and biological criteria is crucial for successful cardiac TE [147]. Besides, the printing process, which involves high temperatures, may pose challenges for maintaining cell viability of cells embedded in the printing material [147,148].",
        "Inkjet-based printing has emerged as a promising and high resolution 3D (bio)printing technique for fabricating hydrogels [149,150]. This technology relies on the controlled deposition of bioink droplets often containing living cells onto a substrate, offering unparalleled control over the spatial arrangement of cellular components (Fig. 2E) [41,151]. In inkjet-based printing, the properties of the ink are primarily governed by the need for high fluidity and precise droplet deposition. The ink must possess a low viscosity to facilitate smooth flow through the narrow nozzles of the printhead, preventing clogging and ensuring consistent material delivery. The viscosity of ink used in inkjet-based printing typically ranges from 3.5 to 12 mPa s [41,151]. The ink must possess a low surface tension, as this facilitates the formation of uniform and well-defined droplets upon ejection from the printhead. Cui and Boland [152] used human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) and fibrin as bioinks to construct microvasculature using a drop-on-demand (inkjet printing) polymerization technique. They successfully fabricated micron-sized fibrin channels, which induced minimal cell damage [152]. When HMVECs were printed alongside fibrin, the cells aligned within the channels and proliferated to form confluent linings. The 3D tubular structures were observed in the printed patterns. The results demonstrated that the combined simultaneous printing of cells and scaffolds promoted HMVEC proliferation and microvasculature formation, highlighting a promising approach for engineering vascular tissues [152]. The precision extends to the deposition of multiple biological components, allowing for the creation of heterogeneous structures within the hydrogel constructs [151,153,154]. Inkjet-printed tissues may need time to develop the appropriate mechanical and biological characteristics, which can limit the speed at which functional tissues can be generated [151,155,156].",
        "Extrusion-based printing involves the extrusion (pneumatic, piston, or screw-driven) of viscous inks through a nozzle and their controlled deposition, allowing for the precise layering of materials to form 3D constructs (Fig. 2F) [41,[157], [158], [159], [160]]. The ability to work with different inks of extended viscosity values, often containing living cells, enables the fabrication of constructs with cellular complexity resembling native cardiac tissues [158,[161], [162], [163]]. However, achieving high resolution may be constrained by the nozzle diameter, affecting the precision of 3D printed hydrogel constructs. [164,165]. Moreover, the rheological behavior of ink in extrusion-based 3D printing should be well-controlled for ensuring consistent material deposition and structural integrity. This behavior ensures that the material flows easily when subjected to the mechanical stress of extrusion, but maintains higher viscosity once deposited, preventing unwanted spreading or sagging [41,159,160,166]. The ink must possess a viscosity within a specific range, typically between 30 mPa/s and above 6 × 107 mPa s, which varies depending on the material and the intended resolution of the print [41,165]. Additionally, the shear forces experienced by cells during the extrusion process may impact cell viability, requiring careful consideration of bioink rheology and formulation [166,167]. Depending on the biomaterial used, post-printing steps such as crosslinking, may be necessary. These steps can influence the mechanical and biological properties of the printed cardiac tissue [168,169]. Microextrusion also facilitates the incorporation of bioactive agents, such as growth factors, enhancing the regenerative potential of printed biomaterials [164,165]. Extrusion-based printing remains a powerful technology for cardiac TE [170,171]. For instance, Jafari et al. [170] developed a series of inks combining poly(vinyl alcohol), gelatin, and carrageenan (P/G/C) for 3D printing tissue-engineered heart valves. These inks/hydrogels were analyzed for their physico-chemical, morphological, mechanical, and rheological properties (Fig. 3A). The microstructure and porosity of the fabricated scaffolds were crucial for performance post-implantation [170]. Specifically, an ink was successfully printed as tri-leaflet heart valves demonstrating the ability to fabricate large constructs without support materials. The printed valves maintained structural features essential for functionality, as confirmed by micro-CT (μCT) scans (Fig. 3B) [170]. Additionally, biocompatibility tests showed minimal cytotoxicity and a suitable immune response. Porcine cardiac valve interstitial cells (PVICs) cultured on hydrogels maintained high viability and proliferated, expressing relevant markers like Vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (Fig. 3C). In vivo implantation in subcutaneous tissue revealed favorable remodeling and integration without chronic inflammation or foreign body reactions (Fig. 3D) [170].Fig. 3(A) SEM micrographs of freeze-dried hydrogels obtained by 3D printing of tissue-engineered heart valve models by using P/G/C ink formulations containing poly(vinyl alcohol) (P), gelatin (G), and carrageenan (C): (i) P5/G2.5/C2, (ii) P5/G2.5/C2.5, (iii) P10/G2.5/C2, (iv) P10/G2.5/C2.5 (scale bar = 50 μm).

        "Biofabricating cell-supportive cardiac patches for direct implantation into myocardial infarctions offers a promising approach for repairing heart damage [161,162,172]. These patches should ideally replicate the ECM of the myocardium to ensure rapid integration with the host tissue, highlighting the need for cardiac constructs with complex characteristics. Specifically, cardiac patches must be electrically conductive, mechanically robust and elastic, biologically active, and prevascularized to effectively support tissue regeneration [161,162,172]. For instance, Esser et al. [162] developed a method to directly 3D-bioprint human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes embedded in a collagen–hyaluronic acid ink, producing centimeter-sized functional cardiac tissues with ring- and ventricle-like shapes in a precise and reproducible manner [162]. The printed tissues, containing well-organized sarcomeres, displayed spontaneous and regular contractions that lasted for several months, with the ability to contract against passive resistance. Notably, the beating frequency of these tissues could be modulated through pharmacological stimulation. This technique offers new potential for creating complex, functional cardiac tissues for use in advanced drug screening and as grafts for organ repair or replacement [162]. Izadifar et al. [161] biofabricated a nanoreinforced hybrid cardiac patch loaded with human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) to improve electrical, mechanical, and biological properties for myocardial infarction repair. Methacrylated collagen (MeCol) was photo-crosslinked using safe ultraviolet (UV) exposure to create micropatterns (Fig. 3E(i)) [161]. Carboxyl-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were incorporated into MeCol and alginate matrices, forming a nanofibrous network that significantly enhanced viscoelastic properties, electrical conductivity, and HCAEC attachment and elongation compared to pristine alginate (Fig. 3E(ii)). Using a UV-integrated 3D bioprinting, they created hybrid hydrogel constructs incorporating a CNT-infused alginate framework and cell-laden MeCol [161]. Over 10 days, HCAECs showed significant proliferation, migration, and differentiation, including lumen-like formation within the constructs. The CNT-functionalized constructs improved mechanical and electrical properties, with CNT-reinforced alginate exhibiting a nanofilamentous network that supported better cell attachment and elongation compared to pristine alginate. Fluorescence microscopy images (Fig. 3F) demonstrated that after 7 days, HCAECs proliferated and migrated from MeCol regions, forming lumen-like structures. After 10 days, elongation and interconnection of actin filaments were observed in the hybrid patch, showing effective HCAEC differentiation (Fig. 3F) [161].",
        "Laser-assisted printing (LAP) technology, which operates on the principle of using laser energy to precisely deposit inks, onto a substrate to fabricate complex 3D structures (Fig. 2G), offers control over cell placement and the ability to fabricate constructs with biomimetic architectures [[173], [174], [175]]. The materials used in LAP should exhibit a high degree of optical absorbance at the laser wavelength to efficiently convert laser energy into thermal energy. This property is crucial for precise material deposition and controlled melting or sintering during the printing process [175]. Additionally, materials need to possess excellent thermal conductivity to dissipate heat uniformly and prevent thermal stresses that could lead to deformation [[174], [175], [176]]. The material should exhibit low thermal expansion to minimize dimensional distortions, ensuring high shape fidelity and precision in the printed object. Moreover, chemical stability and resistance to oxidation are important for maintaining the material integrity and performance over time, especially under the intense heat encountered during LAP process [174,176]. Laser-based printing technology has been successfully applied to fabricate scaffolds for cardiac TE. Gaebel et al. [173] used laser-induced-forward-transfer (LIFT) cell printing to fabricate a cardiac patch seeded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) in a specific pattern for cardiac regeneration (Fig. 4A). cells were seeded in defined patterns on polyester urethane urea cardiac patches (Fig. 4B) [173]. Patches were cultured in vitro or transplanted into the infarcted zone of rat hearts post LAD-ligation. LIFT-derived cell seeding significantly enhanced vessel formation and improved cardiac function in infarcted hearts, demonstrating increased capillary density and integration of human cells into the murine vascular system (Fig. 4C) [173]. LAP offers distinct advantages in hydrogel production for TE. LAP excels in achieving high resolution, enabling the fabrication of complex structures that closely mimic the native architecture of cardiac tissues [173,177]. Nevertheless, the use of lasers, especially in direct laser writing process, can expose cells to potentially harmful levels of heat or radiation, impacting cell viability [41,176]. Additionally, LAP may face limitations in scalability and speed, influencing its applicability for large-scale cardiac tissue constructs [175,176].Fig. 4(A) (i-ii) Design of a LIFT bioprinting process for cell arrangement in grid-patterned for the development of tissue engineering patches.

        "Electrospinning has emerged as a pivotal technology providing a distinctive method for crafting hydrogels tailored for cardiac TE applications [60,178]. Electrospinning is used in the fabrication of nanofibrous structures. Its principle involves the application of an electric field to a polymer solution or melt. which induces a repulsive force overcoming the surface tension of the polymer, causing a fine jet to form (Fig. 2H) [179]. The application of electrospinning for fabricating fibrous hydrogels holds several advantages [178,180]. The high surface area-to-volume ratio of electrospun nanofibers and of fibrous hydrogel hybrid materials enhances cellular interactions and nutrient exchange, promoting tissue regeneration [181,182]. Achieving 3D fibrous structures by electrospinning can be challenging, as electrospun materials typically form two-dimensional membranes. This limitation restricts the biomimicry of complex cardiac tissues with intricate 3D architectures [183]. In electrospinning, the fibrous architecture and properties can be altered by a variety of parameters in the polymer solution (e.g., molecular weight, concentration, mixture of polymers); in the operation of the apparatus (voltage, distance from needle tip to collector plane, injection flow rate, and duration); and in the setup of the collector or other processing conditions (e.g., humidity) [184].",
        "Traditionally, post-seeding of cardiac cells onto these electrospun scaffolds after fabrication is a common approach to promote tissue formation [185,186]. However, innovative studies have introduced cell electrospinning, a technique where cells are directly incorporated into the fibers during the electrospinning process itself [187]. This approach enables the immobilization of multiple cell types within the fibers, creating complex, three-dimensional architectures that better replicate the natural ECM environment. By embedding cells directly into the fibers, this method can enhance cell survival, promote better organization, and improve overall cellular function, making it an attractive and promising technique for developing functional tissues [187,188]. The integration of cells during the electrospinning process not only streamlines scaffold preparation but also potentially improves the physiological relevance and effectiveness of the engineered cardiac tissues, offering significant advancements in the field of TE and regenerative medicine [187,188]. Ehler et al. [187] demonstrated, for the first time, the ability to directly cell-electrospin primary cardiomyocytes into living fibers and scaffolds, presenting a breakthrough for developing 3D cardiac patches for tissue repair and rejuvenation. Using a coaxial needle system (Fig. 5A(i)), they successfully produced cardiomyocyte-laden fibers while maintaining cell viability (Fig. 5A (ii) and Fig. 5A(iii)). They also investigated the effects of cell electrospinning on primary cardiomyocytes to form living cardiac fibers and scaffolds [187]. They found that the electrospinning procedure did not affect cell viability or the integrity of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5B). Staining for contractile proteins, such as sarcomeric alpha-actinin, MyBP-C, and myomesin, showed no differences between electrospun and control cells (cultured cells), indicating intact myofibrils. Additionally, gap junctions, visualized by connexin-43 (Cx43) staining, were present in both groups, suggesting electrical coupling (Fig. 5C). The study demonstrated that cell electrospinning preserved the structural and functional integrity of cardiomyocytes, opening new possibilities for creating functional 3D cardiac tissues [187].Fig. 5(A) (i-ii) Cell electrospinning setup, with (iii) showing a fluorescent image of cardiac cell-bearing fibers/scaffolds.

        "Nanofibrous hydrogels can be generated via various methods, such as layering, mixing of short fibers, and concurrent electrospinning and electrospraying [62,189], although this system is not widely used and has low mechanical stability compared to scaffold-based techniques. However, the methodology to make nanofibrous hydrogels is easily miniaturized and automated to produce composite structures [62]. Combining 3D printing technologies with electrospinning holds immense promise in the biofabrication of nanofibrous hydrogels for cardiac TE, offering a synergistic approach that capitalizes on the unique advantages of each technology [190]. 3D printing excels in creating complex 3D structures with high precision, enabling the recreation of intricate cardiac architectures [191,192]. Electrospinning contributes by generating nanofibrous scaffolds, introducing a level of micro and nanoscale detail that is challenging to achieve with 3D printing alone. The electrospun nanofibers provide a fibrous biomimetic environment, resembling the fiber-filled native ECM, promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, and tissue integration [192,193]. Nevertheless, when considered separately, each technique exhibits specific drawbacks. For instance, 3D printing is hindered by its low resolution, while the shape of electrospun products can remain uncontrollable, thereby restricting their application performances. Consequently, innovative approaches are emerging that integrate both 3D printing and electrospinning methods. This integration aims to harness their respective strengths and alleviate their weaknesses, resulting in an efficient and robust platform. This combined approach proves instrumental in manufacturing novel structural materials and well-organized fibrous 3D scaffolds endowed with enhanced mechano-biological properties [190,194]. Moreover, the use of both electrospinning and 3D printing technologies has led to the fabrication of anisotropic functional structures characterized by precise fiber orientation, facilitating cellular alignment in engineered scaffolds [190,195]. The heart experiences mechanical forces and electrical signaling that are directionally dependent, making fiber orientation a key factor that should be carefully controlled to restore cardiac tissue functionality. By designing anisotropic scaffolds with aligned fibers, these materials support the directional alignment of cardiomyocytes, promoting their synchronization and coordinated contraction, which is essential for efficient cardiac muscle function. In the heart, fibers are aligned in specific orientations to withstand the mechanical forces generated during each heartbeat [196,197]. Engineering anisotropic scaffolds with fibers aligned in a similar direction, provide mechanical strength and flexibility along specific axes, which is essential for replicating the heart natural behavior. This directional strength allows the scaffold to endure the tensile and compressive forces that occur during heart contraction and expansion. Additionally, the aligned fibers help distribute the mechanical load evenly, preventing deformation and enhancing the scaffold stability under the cyclic stress of heartbeats [120,198,199].",
        "Elastomeric biodegradable poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS):gelatin nanofibrous anisotropic scaffolds were fabricated by electrospinning [62,200]. The anisotropy capable of mimicking the left ventricular myocardial architecture which improved its functionality was demonstrated using neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast cells in PGS:gelatin scaffolds, evaluated for cell attachment, proliferation, differentiation, and contractile function of the cardiomyocytes. A study regarding nanofibers and hydrogels used the combination of both material forms in a supporting system for cardiomyocytes for cardiac 10.13039/100024656TE [201]. In this study, one of six different collagen-like synthetic self-assembling nanofiber hydrogels supported the culture of both neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and human embryonic stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes, as observed via cell attachment, growth and function [201]. Jayakumar et al. [202] generated a unique fibrous scaffold consisting of multilayers for vascular TE. The inner layer was made up of poly (lactic acid) (PLA) nanofibers, and the outer layer was composed of PCL/PLA. The multi-layers had large pores for smooth muscle cells (SMCs) penetration. The PLA fiber showed enhanced cellular functionality, and the 10.13039/100018919PCL/PLA outer fiber supported SMC adhesion and proliferation [202]. Studies have demonstrated that designed tubular scaffolds can mimic the morphology of native vessels [202,203]. Several works have demonstrated several applications using fibers and stem cells, fabricated methods, and differentiation routes for heart tissue regeneration, vascular tissue regeneration [204,205]. Cardiomyogenic differentiation of human MSC seeded on scaffolds has been assessed in fibers composed of poly(L-lactic acid)-co-PCL, gelatin and VEGF. Cardiomyogenic differentiation of MSCs on the scaffolds was observed [206]. Moreover, a porous scaffold composed of multilayers with MSCs was used as a bioengineered cardiac patch in a syngeneic rat model [207].",
        "Aligned nanofibers prepared by electrospinning technique have been increasingly investigated in cardiac TE [61,208], because the aligned structures can mimic the anisotropic structural organization of native cardiac tissue and their nano or micro-environment and excellent mechanical properties, provided the guidance cues to enhance cardiomyocyte maturation [186,209]. However, insufficient cell migration into the dense nanofibrous structures and the limited thickness of scaffolds are significant challenges in developing a well-defined scaffold that can control cardiomyocyte orientation within a 3D environment and further mimic the highly organized anisotropic structure of myocardium. This is where the combination of electrospun fibers with a highly hydrated porous support provided by hydrogels plays a crucial role in a hybrid fiber-filled biomaterial [190,197,199,210]. A 3D hybrid scaffold, composed of an aligned conductive nanofiber yarn network made of polycaprolactone, silk fibroin, and carbon nanotubes, encapsulated within a hydrogel shell, was developed to replicate the native structure of cardiac tissues. This design highlights the significant potential of electrospinning and 3D printing techniques in engineering cardiac tissue anisotropy [43]. The aligned conductive nanofiber yarn network effectively enabled control cellular orientation and promoted cardiomyocyte maturation. These 3D hybrid scaffolds, formed by embedding the aligned conductive yarn layers within the hydrogel shell, facilitated the alignment and elongation of cardiomyocytes, enhancing their maturation. 10.13039/100014337Furthermore, the scaffolds supported the co-culture of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, providing a more complex, tissue-like environment [43]. Besides, Qiu et al. [210] investigated the construction of 3D aligned nanofiber scaffolds for cardiac TE. They introduced a trench-guided electrospinning strategy that combined electrospinning and direct ink writing to fabricate aligned nanofiber scaffolds. Their investigation revealed that the trench width/height ratio significantly influenced nanofiber alignment, with a ratio of 1.5 achieving over 60 % alignment [210]. They successfully fabricated scaffolds with controllable porosity (60–80 %) and alignment (30–60 %). When hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were cultured on these scaffolds, a uniform 3D distribution of aligned cells was achieved, with a thickness of approximately 1000 μm. This study demonstrated the potential of this combined approach for efficiently constructing engineered tissues with improved structure and functionality [210].",
        "Furthermore, the high porosity and fiber orientation in the scaffolds enable the customization of mechanical properties, promoting both cell growth and the diffusion of vital nutrients and oxygen essential for optimal tissue functionality [197,211]. The combination of 3D printing and electrospinning offers a highly precise approach for creating patient-specific cardiac patches. By integrating these advanced technologies with computational modeling and patient-specific medical imaging, it becomes possible to design and fabricate scaffolds that are precisely tailored to the anatomical and physiological needs of each patient [212,213]. Mayoral et al. [212] designed an in-vitro, patient-specific cardiac patch combining 3D printing and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation. Using medical images of a 2-month-old girl with aortic arch hypoplasia, they employed computational modeling to identify the most hemodynamically efficient aortic patch for surgical repair. Hybrid FDM printing and electrospinning techniques were used to fabricate the scaffold, which was then seeded with multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) for maturation into derived VSMC (dVSMC) [212]. The graft demonstrated resistance to physiological aortic pressure (burst pressure 101 ± 15 mmHg) and featured a porosity gradient from 80 to 10 μm, facilitating cell infiltration. The bio-scaffolds exhibited good cell viability at days 4 and 12 and a functional vasoactive response to endothelin-1. The study showed that the method generated a patient-specific patch with favorable hemodynamic, mechanical, and functional properties, indicating its potential in regenerative medicine and heart disease prevention [212]. Lee et al. [213] combined 3D printing and electrospinning to fabricate artificial blood vessels from a blend of chitosan and polycaprolactone polymers. The water absorption and hydrophilicity of the composites increased as the proportion of chitosan increased [213]. The fabricated tubular scaffolds exhibited favorable surface morphology and mechanical properties, which were significantly enhanced by the addition of polycaprolactone strands printed onto the electrospun nanofiber substrate. The resulting tubular vessels demonstrated excellent mechanical properties and highlighted that this process might be useful for vascular reconstruction [213].",
        "Recent research has explored the utilization of uniaxially aligned electrospun fibers to functionalize the surfaces of 3D printed spacers, with the aim of inducing directional cell arrangements and enhancing viability in 3D cell cultures [196,[214], [215], [216]]. For instance, Xu et al. [217] implemented a hybrid approach involving electrospinning and inkjet bioprinting of cells. [217]. This process resulted in electrospun layers and thick layers of printed bioink. The hybrid constructs exhibited superior mechanical properties compared to printed hydrogels alone, with viable cells [217]. Wang et al. [211] developed a LEGO-like assembly strategy for fabricating complex muscle structures using combination of 3D printing and electrospinning technologies. They designed modular nanofibrous scaffold bricks with precise micro- and nanoscale structures. These bricks were assembled along the x–y axis to emulate various skeletal muscles, and along the z-axis for complex 3D structures. The bricks were joined using a photopolymerizable fibrinogen-gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel, promoting cell proliferation and migration [211]. Scaffolds mimicking rectus abdominis, bipennate, and orbicular muscles were fabricated by assembling rectangular, parallelogram, and quarter-ring bricks, respectively (Fig. 6A). Fluorescence images showed, alignment of the seeded muscle cells mimicking natural muscle structures (Fig. 6B). This method allowed for the replication of diverse muscle morphologies and facilitated vascularization within a microfluidic system (Fig. 6C). The LEGO-like approach provided a versatile strategy for constructing functional muscle tissue and organ-on-a-chip platforms for biomedical research [211].Fig. 6(A) LEGO-like assembly of modular nanofibrous scaffold bricks developed using a 3D printing-electrospinning hybrid method, for a functional skeletal muscle-on-a-chip (SMoC) platform, with electrical and perfusion stimulation.

        "Wu et al. [196] developed a novel method termed 3D nanofiber-assisted embedded bioprinting (3D-NFEP) that combines 3D printing and electrospinning technologies to create cardiac tissue constructs with oriented morphology. As shown in Fig. 7A, this approach used aligned nanofiber scaffolds fabricated via divergence electrospinning to provide structural support for low-viscosity bioinks, mimicking ECM environment. The aligned fibers induced cell orientation, as confirmed through immunofluorescence staining and microscopy (Fig. 7B), revealing enhanced alignment of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes along nanofiber directions compared to isotropic distribution on Petri dishes. Quantitative analysis further demonstrated superior alignment within a 0° ± 20° range (Fig. 7B). Over 7 days, cells cultured in nanofiber scaffolds exhibited morphological maturation, as evidenced by organized sarcomeres and intercellular gap junctions (Fig. 7C), with improved anisotropic sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity (Fig. 7C). These results highlighted 3D-NFEP as a promising platform for engineering structured cardiac tissues with high precision and enhanced cellular alignment. Lou et al. [216] designed multiscale hybrid patches for cardiac TE using 3D printing and electrospinning as biofabrication technologies. They compared three patch types: pure silicone and silicone-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with random (S-PLGA-R) and aligned (S-PLGA-A) fibers. The S-PLGA-A patches were fabricated by applying a secondary electrical field to achieve fiber orientations of 95–115°, providing structural and biomechanical properties mimicking native myocardium (Fig. 7D) [216]. These patches improved cellular interaction and supported hiPSC derived cardiomyocyte growth. Cells on pure silicone patches formed irregular spheroids, while fibers on S-PLGA-R and S-PLGA-A patches promoted organized myofibrils and cell maturation (Fig. 7E). Contractility tests demonstrated that fiber alignment enhanced functional properties, with S-PLGA-A patches showing superior contractility, directional strain, and synchronization compared to S-PLGA-R (Fig. 7F) [216]. Additionally, the aligned fibers facilitated better communication between hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, enhancing mechanical and electrical properties of patches, and promoting maturation toward an adult-like phenotype. This was confirmed by enhanced contractility observed with digital image correlation and strain analysis, showing that aligned fibers improved maturation and synchronization of the tissue (Fig. 7F). These findings suggest that fiber alignment plays a crucial role in optimizing the mechanical and electrophysiological properties of engineered cardiac tissues, providing a promising approach for regenerative therapies in ischemic heart disease [216].Fig. 7(A) 3D-NFEP process for the fabrication of oriented engineered cardiac tissue.

        "Significant advancements have been made in cardiac safety assessments for drug discovery, targeting drug-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC), a primary cause of drug attrition. Despite the increasing popularity of heart-on-a-chip (HoC) technology, challenges persist in its development due to the anisotropic structure of the native myocardium. A recent study introduced an anisotropic multiscale cardiac scaffold, fabricated through a hybrid biofabrication method that combined 3D printing with electrospinning technology (Fig. 8A) [197]. The 3D printed scaffolds were generated by varying the printing speed rates and adjusting the printing pressures. The diameters (D) of the printed parallel filaments were specified as 200, 400, and 600 μm, while the gap spaces (S) between two parallel filaments were set at 200 and 400 μm [197]. The 3D-printed micrometer-scale scaffold frames mimicked the interwoven anatomical structure of the myocardium, while a network of branched-aligned polycaprolactone/carbon nanotubes (PCL/CNT) electrospun nanofibers guided cellular arrangements. To augment the capability of these multiscale scaffolds for promoting cell adhesion and proliferation, polydopamine (PDA) was introduced as a modification on the nanofiber networks. In vitro 3D bioengineered cardiac tissues were fabricated by encapsulating three-layer multiscale scaffolds within a photocurable methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel shell [197]. The resulting anisotropic multiscale structure enhanced cardiomyocyte maturation and synchronous beating behavior (Fig. 8B). Integrating these 3D bioengineered cardiac tissues with a self-designed microfluidic perfusion system established a 3D anisotropic HoC platform for evaluating DIC and cardioprotective efficacy, showcasing its potential as a valuable preclinical tool for testing drug efficacy and cardiotoxicity [197].Fig. 8(A) Scaffold design and fabrication to replicate the native cardiac tissue structure.

        "In the aim of optimizing hydrogel performance for cardiac TE, researchers have increasingly explored the use of biopolymer-based materials to fabricate robust hydrogels. These biopolymer-based materials, sourced from natural origins, like the polysaccharides and protein-based materials, commonly inherently possess biocompatibility and bioactivity [1,218,219]. Integrating these biopolymer-based materials in hydrogel formulations enhances overall biocompatibility and functionality, bringing the hydrogel scaffolds more in line with the biological environment of the heart [49,63]. However, to emulate the electrophysiological features of cardiac tissues, these biopolymer-based materials are frequently combined with electroconductive polymers to create composite hydrogels tailored for cardiac TE [96,114,162]. Table 1 highlights various approaches and advancements in utilizing electroconductive biopolymer-based materials to that end.

        "For instance, scaffolds incorporating polyaniline with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) or poly(ethylene glycol) (10.13039/501100010368PEG) demonstrated electroactivity and biocompatibility, crucial for supporting cardiomyocytes and other cell types [185]. Similarly, hydrogels combining GelMA, DF-PEG, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) showed enhanced conductivity and mechanical stability, suitable for applications in cardiac and nerve tissue regeneration [220]. Conductive polypyrrole-encapsulated silk fibroin fiber hydrogels supported cardiomyocyte functionality with optimized ratios providing sufficient conductivity for cardiac cell contraction [221]. Additionally, conductive hydrogel patches incorporating graphene oxide and mesenchymal stem cells effectively repaired myocardial infarction damage, underscoring their therapeutic potential for cardiac repair [222]. Furthermore, the fabrication of multifunctional scaffolds combining synthetic and natural polymers, including poly(glycerol sebacate)-polyurethane and gelatin with or without simvastatin, showcased improved bioactivity and mechanical properties while highlighting their utility as drug release carriers in cardiac TE [223]. Moreover, innovative approaches highlighted the fabrication of layered cardiac patches using brown adipose-derived stem cells and electrospun nanofibers containing multi-walled carbon nanotubes. These patches accelerated angiogenesis and reduced inflammation in myocardial infarction models, emphasizing their pivotal role in cardiac remodeling [224]. Electrospun polycaprolactone/gold nanoparticles composite scaffolds coated with gelatin/spironolactone exhibited interconnected porous structures and controlled drug release profiles, promoting cell attachment and viability, thus positioning them as viable candidates for myocardial TE applications [225]. In examining Table 1, several important aspects emerge from the diverse studies on electroconductive biopolymer-based materials for cardiac TE. First, the choice of cells used varied widely, from cardiomyocytes derived from both postnatal rats [60] and hiPSCs [60] to MSCs [226], fibroblasts [185,227], cardiomyoblasts [223], endothelial cells [228] and specific cell lines like H9c2 myoblasts [225]. Each cell type influenced scaffold function differently, impacting their suitability for cardiac tissue regeneration. Cardiomyocytes are fundamental as they are the contractile cells responsible for generating the force needed for cardiac contraction. Their integration into engineered tissues is essential for mimicking the beating function of the heart [60]. MSCs contribute significantly to cardiac repair and regeneration by secreting paracrine factors that promote tissue healing and modulate inflammation. They can differentiate into various cell types further supporting tissue remodeling and vascularization [226]. Fibroblasts play an important role in the structural integrity of cardiac tissues by producing ECM proteins such as collagen and elastin. Their presence helps maintain tissue architecture and mechanical strength [185,227]. Cardiomyoblasts are precursor muscle cells capable of differentiating into cardiomyocytes, the contractile cells of the heart. They are widely used in research to explore heart development, disease mechanisms, and regenerative strategies. A notable example is the H9c2 cell line, derived from rat heart tissue, which serves as a valuable model in cardiac studies [223,229,230]. H9c2 myoblasts served as a model for studying cardiac cell behavior, testing drug responses, and optimizing TE protocols [225]. However, it is important to note that H9c2 cells are not contractile, but they are proliferative and can exhibit characteristics of skeletal muscle under specific conditions, such as differentiation into multinucleated myotubes [229,231]. Endothelial cells are essential for forming new blood vessels in the engineered tissue. They ensure proper vascularization, which is crucial for providing oxygen and nutrients to the regenerating cardiac tissue and removing metabolic waste, thereby supporting cell survival and function [173,228]. In addition, biofabrication technologies like electrospinning have facilitated the design of fibrous scaffolds with tailored fiber diameters and enhanced mechanical properties [60,221,226], while 3D bioprinting has enabled the precise placement of cells in hydrogels, crucial for mimicking native tissue architecture [222,228]. Moreover, hydrogel compositions can significantly vary, allowing the integration of various biopolymer-based materials, electroconductive components and cells. Their formulation has been tailored to improve scaffold biocompatibility, mechanical strength and electrical conductivity, crucial for supporting cardiac tissue function [220,[225], [226], [227]].",
        "The subsequent sections delve into various biopolymers and biopolymer-based materials commonly used in fabricating hydrogels for cardiac TE. Table 2 provides details on several biopolymers, their sources, chemical compositions, and properties, highlighting their scientific and practical significance. Chitosan, mainly derived from crustacean shells and fungal cell walls, is flexible, hydrogel-forming, antimicrobial and bioactive, suitable for wound healing due to its self-healing properties [160,232]. Alginate, obtained from brown seaweeds, forms hydrogels with divalent cations and is widely used in TE due to its water solubility and biocompatibility [233,234]. Hyaluronic acid, naturally present in connective tissues, retains water and lubricates joints, making it ideal for preparation of hydrogels which have found applications for example in cosmetics and biomedicine [235,236]. Cellulose present in plant cell walls, is the most abundant biopolymer in Earth, which exhibits high tensile strength and has been increasingly used in medical applications despite its water insolubility [40]. Carrageenan and pectin, derived from red seaweeds and plant cell walls respectively, form gels and are used in food, biomedicine and pharmaceutical industry due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability [[237], [238], [239]]. Besides, proteins such as collagen, gelatin, fibrin, elastin, silk fibroin form TE biomaterials with appropriate tunable mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Collagen, with high tensile strength and flexibility, constitute the ECM in tissues together with other biomolecules [240]; while gelatin, derived from collagen, is used in biomedicine and pharmaceuticals due to its gel-like consistency [220,241]. Fibrin forms stable clots and is crucial in wound healing [242], elastin provides tissue elasticity [243,244], and silk fibroin offers biocompatibility as well as high flexibility and toughness [245].Table 2Overview of features and properties of polysaccharides and proteins highlighted in this review.Table 2PolymersSourcesChemical CompositionPhysical PropertiesSolubilityBiocompatibilityMechanical PropertiesBiodegradabilityRef.PolysaccharidesChitosanMainly derived from crustaceans (e.g., shrimp shells) and squids.Composed of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine units.Film-forming, and antimicrobial property.

        "Overview of features and properties of polysaccharides and proteins highlighted in this review.",
        "The use of polysaccharides in hydrogel preparation has become a central focus in cardiac TE [271]. This trend is propelled by their outstanding attributes, including inherent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and adept mimicry of the native ECM [160,272]. Polysaccharides closely emulate the ECM composition and architecture enhancing cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Polysaccharides such as chitosan, cellulose, pectin and dextran are biomaterials that not only offer structural support but also establish a bioactive microenvironment for cellular interactions [41,273]. Their biocompatibility ensures minimal adverse reactions in physiological contexts, while biodegradability permits controlled degradation over time, aligning with the dynamic nature of tissue regeneration processes [159,254]. As a result, they are components of great interest in tailoring functional hydrogels for cardiac TE [248,273].",
        "Polysaccharides are essential in the development of hydrogels for 10.13039/100024656TE due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and water retention capabilities, which help create a hydrated environment that supports cell survival and tissue growth [40,41,159,160,248]. These polysaccharides form networks that trap significant amounts of water, maintaining the moisture necessary for cellular functions and offering a customizable matrix for various biomedical applications, such as drug delivery and wound healing [40,41]. However, several polysaccharides like alginate lack natural cell recognition sites, such as the RGD (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid) motif, which are crucial for cell adhesion. As a result, cells often do not attach strongly to these materials, leading to improper cellular interactions [274,275]. Besides the RGD sequence, other recognition sites commonly grafted to alginate for cell adhesion include peptides containing the IKVAV (isoleucine-lysine-valine-alanine-valine) sequence and peptides containing the YIGSR (tyrosine-isoleucine-glycine-serine-arginine) sequence [276,277]. These sequences are recognized by specific cell surface receptors, promoting cell attachment and spreading [276,277]. To address this limitation, researchers commonly modify these hydrogels by incorporating bioactive molecules or peptides or by combining polysaccharides with other natural and synthetic polymers to fabricate robust and functional hydrogels that promote cell adhesion [[276], [277], [278], [279]]. Functionalizing polysaccharides with these recognition sites enables the hydrogels to better mimic the natural ECM, thereby creating a more conducive environment for tissue regeneration and repair [276,277].",
        "Chitosan (CHI), a natural polysaccharide, stands out as a versatile and extensively used polymer in hydrogel formulations. It possesses a myriad of properties that make it exceptionally well-suited for creating hydrogels tailored to meet the intricate demands of cardiac tissue [160,256,280]. Chitosan is a polysaccharide derived from chitin, a major component mainly found in the exoskeletons of crustaceans such as shrimps, crabs, and lobsters. It is a linear polysaccharide composed of β-(1  →  4)-linked D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units [249,281,282]. In weakly acidic aqueous media, CHI undergoes protonation of amino groups (-NH2) to form positively charged ammonium groups (-NH3+) [160]. Chitosan-based hydrogels have shown potential in cardiac TE [182,250,251,283], but they face several challenges, particularly regarding their mechanical properties. These hydrogels often have lower mechanical strength compared to other materials, limiting their ability to provide adequate support and durability in the heart dynamic environment. Additionally, their elasticity is often insufficient to mimic the natural flexibility of cardiac tissue, which is essential for proper heart function [284,285].",
        "Several noteworthy research studies highlighted the application of biofabrication technologies such as electrospinning and 3D printing in the fabrication of chitosan-based hydrogels for cardiac tissue regeneration [182,283,286]. For example, varying weight percentages of conductive electrospun polypyrrole (PPy) nanofibers (5–25 %) in combination with chitosan, collagen, and polyethylene oxide were developed to expedite tissue healing [287]. Increasing PPy content in developed composites reduced fiber diameter, and at 10 %, it achieved optimal conductivity (164.274 × 10−3 S/m), falling within the semi-conductive to conductive polymer range. MTT assay (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay) and SEM analyses revealed superior cell adhesion and proliferation at that 10 % PPy content, making these nanofiber scaffolds particularly suitable for regenerating electrically active tissues like cardiovascular, heart muscles, or nerve tissues [287]. In another work, patterned membranes composed of chitosan-gelatin-guar gum were fabricated using 3D printing, resulting in significantly enhanced elasticity and tensile resistance [288]. A numerical model was developed to predict the elasticity of membranes with specific internal patterns, allowing for the modeling of complex membranes with tunable elastic properties matching myocardium anisotropy [288]. The study also involved evaluating the developed membrane ability to withstand cyclic fatigue tests, requiring potential adjustments to the model for viscoelasticity, considering heartbeat rates [288]. In the pursuit of addressing global heart failure stemming from myocardial infarction, a range of electrospun polyurethane/chitosan/carbon nanotubes composite nanofibrous scaffolds, exhibiting both random and aligned orientations, were crafted to emulate the ECM structure [182]. Comprehensive characterizations highlighted their electroconductivity and biocompatibility with H9c2 cells. The aligned nanofibers demonstrated particular promise as nanoscale scaffolds for regenerating infarcted myocardium [182].",
        "To optimize the performance of cardiac cells, various methodologies are employed, with electrical stimulation being a prominent technique aimed at bolstering their functionality and fostering tissue maturation [25]. This approach involves applying controlled electrical impulses to the cells, which is designed to mimic natural physiological conditions and encourage the cells to develop and function more effectively [25,228]. By simulating the electrical signals that cells would typically experience in the heart, researchers aim to enhance the maturity and functionality of cardiac tissues, potentially advancing therapeutic strategies for heart disease and other cardiac-related conditions [[289], [290], [291]]. Abedi et al. [289] combined chitosan (CHI)-based electrically conductive scaffolds, small molecules (SMs), electrical stimulation (ES), and stem cells in cardiac TE applications (Fig. 9A). Electrospun composite scaffolds made of CHI and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were fabricated. Fig. 9B highlights the SEM images of the electrospun composites obtained. The optimal MWCNT concentration was determined to be 2 % w/w, which reduced the average fiber diameter from 225 nm to 110 nm, increased electrical conductivity from 8 × 10−5 S/m to 9 × 10−3 S/m, and tripled tensile strength [289]. Using a 10-day differentiation protocol with SMs and ES, unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs) were differentiated into cardiomyocytes. Scaffold + SM + ES showed significant overexpression of cardiac-associated genes troponin I, CX43, and β-MHC, increasing by 172, 5.3, and 64 times, respectively. Cells were cultured on fabricated scaffolds to assess the impact of the physical and chemical properties of these latter on cell viability and proliferation [289]. By the first day of culture, CHI/PVA samples showed more cells than MWCNT-containing samples. MWCNT scaffolds, with smaller fiber diameters, higher surface area, and electrical conductivity, facilitated cell signaling and promoted cellular extensions. SEM imaging of cell attachment on fabricated scaffolds showed cells on CHI/PVA/MWCNT forming polygonal shapes with extensions, while CHI/PVA samples showed limited cell extension growth (Fig. 9C). These findings highlighted the importance of integrating multiple additives and stimuli to achieve cardiac tissue functionality in TE biomaterials [289].Fig. 9(A) Schematic representation of the synergistic application of conductive polymeric CHI/PVA/MWCNTs nanofibers, intracellular signaling modulators, and electrical stimulation for enhanced cardiac TE.

        "Chitosan also exhibits inherent antimicrobial properties. This attribute can arise from its cationic charge, which can disrupt microbial cell membranes, leading to the inhibition of bacterial and fungal growth [292]. Furthermore, chitosan-based hydrogels can interfere with microbial metabolism by binding to DNA, inhibiting replication and transcription [293]. The hydrogels can also create a barrier effect, physically trapping bacteria and limiting their proliferation within the hydrogel matrix [292,293]. In the context of cardiac TE, where preventing infections is of paramount importance, CHI antimicrobial characteristics contribute to the overall safety and efficacy of hydrogel-based therapeutic interventions. Chitosan has improved the engraftment and survival of cells, thereby contributing to the process of myocardial repair [286,294]. Additionally, CHI mechanical properties can be tailored to suit the specific requirements of cardiac tissue. Through adjustments in processing methods, crosslinking, and blending with other polymers, the mechanical strength of CHI-based hydrogels can be finely tuned. This is crucial for mimicking the mechanical properties of biomaterials, ensuring optimal support for cell growth and tissue regeneration [295,296]. Almasi-Jaf et al. [297] developed mechanically reinforced CHI-based grafts that successfully supported growth and proliferation of cardiac cells. A heparinized bilayer graft was developed, comprising an inner layer of heparinized polycaprolactone, polyurethane and gelatin co-electrospun, and an outer layer of chitosan, gelatin, and silk fibroin freeze-dried hydrogel [297]. The graft exhibited high ultimate stress (4.16 ± 0.25 MPa), Young's modulus (8.24 ± 2.59 MPa), and suture retention (4.83 ± 0.31 N). Heparin release from developed grafts was sustained at approximately 70 % over 4 weeks. The heparinized samples showed suitable anti-thrombogenic properties in platelet adhesion assays. The outer hydrogel layer, crosslinked with non-toxic materials, achieved high porosity (64.63 %), suitable for smooth muscle cell activity. Both layers supported high cell viability, with endothelial cells at 78.96 % and smooth muscle cells at 57.77 % [297].",
        "Alginate (Alg), a polysaccharide derived from brown seaweed, plays a pivotal role in hydrogel formulations tailored for cardiac TE. This natural polymer, characterized by its biocompatibility and hydrophilic nature, is frequently used to construct hydrogel matrices for cardiac TE, either in combination with other polymeric materials or by functionalizing it with bioactive molecules [278,279,298]. Alginate is composed of linear chains of (1–4)-linked β-D-mannuronic acid (M) and α-L-guluronic acid (G) residues [254,299]. The ratio of M to G units, as well as the distribution along the alginate chains, influences its physical and chemical properties [299]. One of Alg distinctive features is its ionogelation, a property that significantly influences its use in hydrogel fabrication. Alginate undergoes gelation when exposed to divalent cations, with Ca2+ ions being the most commonly employed [299,300]. While Alg possesses several advantageous properties for certain applications in cardiac TE such as biocompatibility and ease of gelation, its mechanical properties may need enhancement for cardiac TE applications. Alg hydrogels are known for their relatively low stiffness and lack of contractility, which are important considerations when aiming to replicate the dynamic and contractile nature of heart tissues [298,301,302]. To address these limitations, researchers often modify Alg or combine it with other materials to improve its mechanical properties. Common strategies include reinforcing Alg with nanomaterials, other polymers, including natural ones like proteins. These modifications aim to increase the overall stiffness, strength and elasticity of the Alg-based hydrogels [303,304].",
        "3D printing and electrospinning technologies have become potent technology for producing Alg-based hydrogels [247,279]. Each year, numerous aortic valve replacements are required for valve diseases, prompting the pursuit of TE heart valves with remodeling capabilities [234]. Despite challenges in replicating the intricate 3D anatomy, Rioux et al. [234] introduced a novel technique for swift fabrication of tricuspid aortic valve scaffolds using Alg-based hydrogels. This method involved injecting a Alg hydrogel into a mold crafted by a custom-made sugar glass 3D printer, followed by dissolution of the mold using a custom-made dissolving module [234]. Tested in a cardiac bioreactor mimicking physiological conditions, the scaffolds demonstrated functional repeatability, establishing the potential for swift fabrication of cell-seeded Alg scaffolds for heart valve TE [234]. In another study, cardiac constructs with a unique angular structure mimicking cardiac architecture were developed using 3D printing with alginate (Alg) and gelatin (Gel) composites. Various composite ratios were examined for cytotoxicity and printability, with the optimal combinations (Alg2Gel1 and Alg3Gel1) chosen [279]. The 3D-printed structures were characterized, revealing that Alg3Gel1 exhibited higher elastic modulus, lower swelling, and less mass loss compared to Alg2Gel1. Cell viability studies demonstrated that the 3D constructs with the angular design maintained significantly more viable cells, exceeding 99 % viability for both H9c2 and HUVECs cells. This approach showcased the potential of 3D-printed Alg-Gel composites for cardiac TE [279]. Electrospinning technology was also employed to design Alg based hybrid hydrogels. In a sequential electrospinning method, tri-layered electrospun Alg–graphene oxide (GO)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) conductive scaffolds were developed, simulating the cardiac ECM. The middle 10.13039/100018919PCL layer provided mechanical support, while the top and bottom Alg–GO layers offered cell viability, attachment, and electroconductivity [247]. The scaffolds exhibited GO presence and Alg nanofiber crosslinking. Incorporating 1 wt% GO, the electroconductivity reached 7.29 ± 0.91 μS. Mechanical properties of the scaffold, with Alg–0.5 wt% GO/PCL, demonstrated ultimate tensile strength and Young's modulus of 22.46 ± 0.07 and 4.35 ± 0.56 MPa, respectively [247]. Despite accelerated degradation in PBS solution, the scaffolds enhanced cardiac progenitor cell viability, adhesion, and proliferation. These tri-layered electroconductive Alg–PCL nanofibrous scaffolds have shown promise for cardiac TE [247]. However, H9c2-based studies are limited in their significance for cardiac TE. H9c2 cells lack the spontaneous contractile properties typical of primary cardiomyocytes. While they exhibit some cardiac-like features and are commonly used as a model for cardiac research, they do not possess the ion channel activity or sarcomeric organization required for spontaneous contraction. As a result, they are less suitable for investigating contractile functions in cardiac TE [[229], [230], [231]].",
        "Hyaluronic acid (HA), a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) inherent in the ECM, emerges as an interesting material in the design of hydrogels for cardiac TE [305]. Composed of repeating disaccharide units of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, HA forms a linear and non-sulfated GAG polymer. Its high biocompatibility and water-binding capacity contribute to its prominence in hydrogel formulations [306]. Its high water retention capacity enables it to maintain tissue hydration and elasticity. HA plays a vital role in wound healing, cell adhesion and proliferation due to its interactions with cell surface receptors like CD44 [307]. It exhibits low immunogenicity and can be chemically modified for enhanced stability or functionality in applications such as drug delivery, TE and cosmetic formulations. This biopolymer brings a unique set of attributes, orchestrating essential cell signaling events [235,305]. It can be sourced from various biological origins or produced through microbial fermentation [236]. HA-based hydrogels exhibit an exceptional water-retaining capacity, creating an environment akin to the physiological conditions within the cardiac tissue [308]. The interactions between HA and cell surface receptors, such as CD44, initiate signaling cascades that influence cell behavior [309,310].",
        "HA is usually blended with other components to fabricate composite hydrogels using 3D printing technologies [241,311]. HA alone lacks the mechanical strength and bioactivity to mimic the cardiac ECM. When combined with other biomaterials or synthetic polymers, HA-based hydrogels can better support cell growth, provide structural integrity, and promote tissue regeneration, offering tunable properties like elasticity, mechanical strength, and biocompatibility essential for cardiac repair [241,305,311]. For example, a 3D-printed patch, consisting of cardiac progenitor cells embedded in a hyaluronic acid/gelatin (HA/gel) matrix was evaluated for therapeutic potential, which demonstrated enhanced cardiac cell therapy. The 3D printed HA/Gel biocomplex loaded with hCMPCs maintained the cell viability, proliferation and differentiation capabilities [311]. Transplanting the 3D printed biocomplex into a mouse model of myocardial infarction resulted in a significant reduction in adverse remodeling, preservation of cardiac function, and sustained in vivo survival and engraftment of hCMPCs. This study underscored the effectiveness of this translational approach in improving the delivery and impact of hCMPCs in cardiac tissues [311]. Bioinks were developed utilizing decellularized human heart ECM (dhECM) incorporating gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) or GelMA-methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA) hydrogels, dual crosslinked with UV light and microbial transglutaminase (mTGase). The resulting composite GelMA–MeHA–dhECM hydrogels exhibited significantly enhanced mechanical properties compared to GelMA–dhECM hydrogels [312]. These hydrogels exhibited biocompatibility with human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and human cardiac fibroblasts. They facilitated the creation of tissue-like constructs with precise control over mechanical properties, cellular content, and macromolecular composition, demonstrating their potential for modeling myocardial infarct boundaries in vitro [312].",
        "Dextran, a polysaccharide derived from glucose linked by α-1,6 glycosidic bonds, has also gained prominence in TE hydrogel formulations [272]. The innate biocompatibility of dextran ensures minimal adverse reactions when introduced into biological systems [313]. Banerjee et al. [314] developed dextran-derived hydrogels as a chemically-defined matrix for in vitro cardiac TE. Hydrogels were fabricated in situ using hydrazone crosslinking, with material properties adjusted by varying dextran derivatization and molecular weight [314]. To enhance bioactivity of hydrogels, cyclic pentapeptide RGD was added to dextran. Blends of modified dextran and human collagen combined with iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, supported tissue formation and functional maturation, demonstrating the potential of hydrogels for cardiac grafts [314]. Moreover, dextran-based hydrogels exhibit controlled degradation profiles, which can be beneficial in cardiac 10.13039/100024656TE, where a balanced degradation profile is essential to provide sustained support during tissue regeneration [315]. In addition, the versatility of dextran extends to applications requiring the controlled release of bioactive molecules in the cardiac microenvironment [316]. This is particularly valuable in cardiac TE, where precise delivery of growth factors, cytokines, or other signaling molecules is essential for orchestrating the regenerative processes within the damaged tissue [[316], [317], [318]]. A study has tackled the issue of inadequate vascularization, which restricts the ability to effectively support prolonged cell survival, by developing hydrogels with tubular geometries, replicating the structures of human small arteries/veins and arterioles/venules [319]. Surface coating with ECM proteins has promoted endothelial cell monolayer adhesion. Notably, small-diameter channels composed of neutral pullulan and dextran within hydrogels initially unsupportive of endothelial cell adhesion, have transformed them into active materials guiding cell behavior solely through internal microarchitecture modifications, eliminating the need for added proteins [319]. The materials have induced endothelial cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and polarization, emphasizing the influence of internal channel curvature. This work has showcased a geometrically guided, pro-vascularizing material, marking a significant stride in TE biomaterials [319]. Electrospun dextran-based hydrogels were fabricated for cardiovascular regeneration. Emulsion electrospinning was used to fabricate core-shell nanofibers, offering advantages such as reduced initial burst release and preserved bioactivity of drugs or proteins. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was encapsulated with protective agents or bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the core of poly(l-lactic acid-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL) nanofibers for sustained release scaffolds in cardiovascular tissue regeneration [320]. Uniform nanofibers were obtained with diameters of 572 ± 92 nm for PLCL, 460 ± 63 nm for PLCL-VEGF-BSA, and 412 ± 61 nm for PLCL-VEGF-dextran. Release studies demonstrated controlled VEGF release over 28 days. Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells confirmed scaffold functionality. This study highlighted emulsion electrospun core-shell PLCL/dextran nanofibers as potential substrates for controlled-release applications in cardiac TE [320].",
        "Cellulose is a linear polysaccharide composed of glucose repeating units connected by β-1,4-glycosidic linkages [40,254,256,321]. Multiple cellulose chains align through hydrogen bonding, forming microfibrils that contribute to the strength and rigidity of plant cell walls. The arrangement of cellulose molecules in a crystalline structure provides remarkable mechanical strength and stability to biomaterials as well as finely modulate porosity [160,256,322,323]. Cellulose and its derivatives have emerged as components in hydrogel fabrication for cardiac TE [40,324,325]. Cellulose, renowned for its robust mechanical properties, serves as a cornerstone in the fabrication of mechanically reinforced hydrogels for TE [160,326]. In addition, the fibrous nature of cellulose contributes to the formation of a reinforcing network in hydrogels, elevating their mechanical strength [160,248,326]. Beyond its mechanical prowess, cellulose stands out for its inherent biocompatible nature, making it an invaluable component in the field of TE [160,327,328].",
        "Numerous research studies have emphasized the effectiveness and versatility of cellulose-based hydrogels in tackling significant challenges in cardiac tissue regeneration [324,329]. Cellulosic scaffolds with an inherent 3D origami crease pattern were designed for cardiac TE. The study explored various cellulosic materials, such as cotton linters, fibers from eucalyptus, pine, spruce, and lyocell [329]. Cotton linters sheets were chosen for further investigation due to their optimal biocompatibility and mechanical properties for cardiomyocytes in both wet and dry conditions: Young's modulus of 0.8 GPa, tensile strength of 4.7 MPa, and tensile strength in a wet environment of 2.28 MPa were determined. To achieve cell alignment, different methods, including a dynamic sheet former and Rapid Köthen sheet former, were explored. Despite minimal orientation, cells cultured on the cellulose fibers grew and aligned along them [329]. In another study, a biomaterial system comprising 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical-oxidized nanocellulose (TOCNF), poly(glycerol sebacate (PGS), and polypyrrole (PPy) was fabricated for myocardial TE. Direct ink writing (DIW) was employed to fabricate multifunctional lattice structures suitable for myocardial infarction treatment (Fig. 10A). These structures, exhibiting elasticity and electrical conductivity, supported extensive cell growth, making them ideal cardiac patches [330]. The nanocellulose-based scaffolds showed high porosity (94 ± 1 %) beneficial for cell growth and interaction. Scaffolds with single-component TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNF) were significantly more porous compared to those with PGS-PPy or multicomponent counterparts (Fig. 10B). The biocompatibility of 3D-printed composites undergoing degradation was assessed using the MTT assay and compared with a positive control. As shown in Fig. 10C(i), degradation did not affect H9c2 cardiomyoblast viability, with no cytotoxicity detected over 28 days [330]. The histogramm shown in Fig. 10C(ii) demonstrates that all 3D-printed biocomposites supported cardiomyoblast proliferation, with no significant differences between PPy loadings. The proliferation rate of H9c2 cells on the biocomposites was comparable to that of the TOCNF porous structure, doubling every two weeks. SEM analysis demonstrated strong cell attachment, with bodies assembling on pore surfaces and elongating along pore walls. Fig. 10C(iii) and Fig. 10C(iv) illustrate the control and cell-seeded biocomposite, confirming positive cell-scaffold interactions. The hydrophilicity, high porosity, and surface area of TOCNF and PGS facilitated adhesion while maintaining cell viability [330]. An electrospun scaffold crafted from polyurethane (PU) and ethyl cellulose (EC), featuring uniform fibrous nanostructures and a 3D porous network was also achieved. The research established the correlation between processing conditions and fibrous nanostructures, enabling rational processing with tunable fiber diameters [324]. The resulting scaffold demonstrated high biocompatibility, supporting the proliferation of H9c2 cells. Boasting remarkable mechanical strength, the PU/EC scaffolds allowed the fabrication of ultrathin patches compatible with contractile tissues, demonstrating promising potential in the field of cardiac TE [324].Fig. 10(A) (i) Schematic illustration depicting TOCNF, pre-PGS, and PPy used in DIW ink formulation and 3D-printed scaffold fabrication.

        "Carrageenan, derived from red seaweeds, has a molecular structure consisting of galactose repeating units and 3,6-anhydrogalactose, forming linear chains with various sulfation patterns [331]. It exhibits biocompatibility, biodegradability, and gelation properties, making it suitable for hydrogel fabrication, as well as for cell encapsulation and proliferation [262]. Carrageenan ability to form thermally reversible gels allows for easy processing and incorporation of bioactive agents [238].",
        "Research studies have emphasized the utilization of 3D printing in the fabrication of carrageenan-based hydrogels for applications in cardiac TE [170,331]. κ-carrageenan-based hydrogels fabricated through 3D printing revealed controllable structures and improved cell viability [331]. Varying the shear stress produced small-diameter (<6 mm) gel filaments simulating blood vessel structures. HUVECs cultured on κ-carrageenan and composite gels (carrageenan/carbon nanotube and carrageenan/alginate) showed enhanced cell attachment and proliferation on composite gels compared to pure κ-carrageenan [331]. In addition, carrageenan-based composite bioinks exhibited superior printability, mechanical stiffness, interconnectivity and biocompatibility. Optimizing printing parameters allowed precise adjustment of hydrogel structure, facilitating the preparation of 3D TE scaffolds with optimal pore size, porosity, and distribution [331]. Another research work highlighted the formulation and evaluation of carrageenan composite inks for 3D printing of functional of TE heart valves (TEHVs) [170]. In vitro and in vivo assessments of 3D hydrogels encompassed biocompatibility, immune response, hemolysis, thrombogenicity, and hydrodynamics under physiological conditions. The results demonstrated that these 3D-printed TEHVs exhibited mechanical characteristics comparable to native leaflets, minimal hemolysis, low thrombogenicity, and the ability to withstand aortic conditions, presenting a promising solution for valve replacement challenges [170].",
        "Pectin, a complex polysaccharide found in the cell walls of plants, has garnered significant attention in the field of cardiac TE [278,332]. Comprising a linear chain of α-1,4-linked D-galacturonic acid units, pectin exhibits a high degree of structural variability depending on its source and extraction method [239]. In cardiac TE, pectin based hydrogels have demonstrated potential in emulating the ECM, and promoting cell adhesion and proliferation [278]. Pectin is a versatile biomaterial for developing cardiovascular constructs with enhanced structural support and the potential for vascular applications in 10.13039/100024656TE [263,332]. Li et al. [263] prepared hydrogel nanofiber scaffolds with varying oxidation degrees (25 % and 50 %) using periodate oxidation, electrospinning, and adipic acid dihydrazide crosslinking. Nano-sized fibrous structures with fiber diameters ranging from 300 to 400 nm were achieved. Mesenchymal stem cells cultured on these scaffolds for 14 days showed high viability [263]. Scaffolds of different stiffness were evaluated for their potential in MSC differentiation into vascular cells using gene expression analysis. Stiffer scaffolds promoted MSC differentiation into vascular smooth muscle cells, while softer mats favored differentiation into endothelial cells. These findings highlight the capability of pectin hydrogel nanofibers to provide mechanical cues that facilitate MSC differentiation into vascular cells, showcasing their potential in stem cell-based TE [263].",
        "To enhance its bioactivity, particularly in promoting cell attachment and interaction, pectin has been subjected to biochemical modification. One prevalent method involved the use of RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic Acid) sequences to modify pectin and augment its biological properties. The RGD sequence is recognized for its ability to facilitate cell adhesion by interacting with specific cell receptors, including integrins present on the cell surface. This modification is frequently applied in the field of 10.13039/100024656TE and regenerative medicine to enhance the functionality of biomaterials like hydrogels, aiming to provide better support for cell growth and tissue regeneration [237,332,333]. By employing a coaxial flow wet-spinning system, Campiglio et al. [332] ingeniously produced 3D fibrous patches laden with cells, incorporating RGD-modified pectin to exploit the advantageous properties of hydrogel and fibrous architecture. The rapid fabrication of self-standing patches, ranging from 100 to 200 μm in diameter, was achieved through precise adjustments of pectin and calcium ions concentrations [332]. These patches exhibited high cell density and uniform dispersion, with cells remaining highly viable for up to 2 weeks, showcasing the potential of modified-pectin in scaffolds to support muscle tissue regeneration. The inherent porosity, favorable cell–material interaction, and the ability to guide cell alignment make these microfibers conducive to fostering functional tissue formation [332].",
        "Proteins, being integral components of the native ECM, play a fundamental role in the formulation of hydrogels for cardiac TE [42,90,221,334]. Proteins can either serve as a key component in the development of hydrogel matrices or be incorporated into matrices composed of polysaccharides and other materials to more closely mimic cardiac tissues. By integrating proteins into biopolymer-based matrices, these hybrid matrices can better replicate the bioactive environment of the heart, enhancing cell adhesion and proliferation. This approach helps in fabricating more functional and physiologically relevant models for cardiac TE [60,221,279]. In hydrogel formulations for cardiac TE, various proteins are commonly used to mimic the natural ECM. Among the most frequently employed proteins are collagen, gelatin, fibrin, elastin and silk fibroin [335,336].",
        "Collagen is a fibrous helical protein primarily extracted from animal connective tissues. It is composed of three polypeptide chains, which helical structure. This triple helix confers stability and strength to collagen [264]. The primary structure of collagen includes glycine, proline and hydroxyproline, where glycine due to its small size allows for tight packing of the helical structure. Hydroxyproline provides additional stability through hydrogen bonding between the polypeptide chains [265]. Collagen is highly resistant to tension, making it an essential component in tissues requiring strength, such as tendons and ligaments [337,338]. Its ability to self-assemble into fibrillar networks contributes to its role in the ECM, providing mechanical support to tissues [339]. Collagen is biodegradable, allowing controlled degradation over time as tissues remodel [340]. Additionally, it can interact with cell surface receptors promoting cell adhesion, migration and signaling. These features make collagen a versatile and valuable biomaterial in TE and regenerative medicine [341].",
        "Through 3D printing, collagen-based inks can be precisely deposited in controlled architectures, mimicking the complex structures of native cardiac tissue. Lee et al. [172] innovatively 3D-printed collagen hydrogels using the freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) method for human heart components, achieving versatile scales from capillaries to complete organs. resulted in a filament resolution of 20 μm, porous microstructure enabling rapid cellular infiltration, and mechanical strength for fabricating multiscale vasculature and tri-leaf valves [172]. FRESH 3D-printed hearts accurately mirrored patient-specific anatomies, validated by micro–computed tomography. Cardiac ventricles with human cardiomyocytes exhibited synchronized contractions, directional action potential propagation, and up to 14 % wall thickening during peak systole [172]. Recently, an adaptation of the FRESH method has been used for directly 3D bioprinting hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes into ring and ventricle-shaped constructs which exhibited spontaneous construction for several month [162]. Electrospinning has been also used to fabricate collagen-based fibrous hydrogels for cardiac TE [342,343]. Karapehlivan et al. [342] developed electrospun nanofibers composed of polycaprolactone (PCL), graphene oxide, and collagen as a potential treatment for cardiac injuries as illustrated in Fig. 11A. Graphene oxide was incorporated in nanofiber fabrication to enhance electrical stimulation and support cardiomyocyte contraction and elongation, while collagen was added due to its role in the myocardial extracellular matrix. The SEM images of cardiomyocyte cells on the nanofibers highlighted their excellent biocompatibility, showing cell growth and proliferation on the nanofibers (Fig. 11B) [342]. Cell fluorescence imaging further confirmed the results of the MTT assay, showing that cells proliferated on the nanofibers (Fig. 11C). The response of nanofibers to alternating current (AC) signals was assessed over frequencies ranging from 40 Hz to 105 Hz (Fig. 11D). Direct current (DC) conductivity values of fabricated nanofibers ranged from 1.10−10 to 6.10−10 S m−1 at 25 °C (Fig. 11D), while AC conductivity displayed frequency-dependent behavior (Fig. 11E) [342]. Among the tested formulations, 17 % PCL/1.5 % graphene oxide/5 % collagen nanofibers exhibited the highest DC and AC conductivity compared to 17 % PCL/1.5 % graphene oxide nanofibers. The findings highlights the potential of these collagen-based electroconductive nanofibers for cardiac TE [342]. Collagen was also blended with synthetic materials such as polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to fabricate composites. Electrospinning successfully produced random polylactic acid (PLA), polylactic acid/polyethylene glycol (PLA/PEG), random or aligned polylactic acid/polyethylene glycol/collagen (PLA/PEG/COL) nanofiber patches [343]. The resulting patches exhibited beadles and smooth structures, with a collagen fiber diameter of 755 nm [343]. Mechanical characterization revealed that aligned patches had the highest tensile strength (5.90 MPa), and in vitro degradation tests showed the highest degradation percentage for the aligned patch. These patches exhibited promising potential as tissue-like cardiac patches for the regenerative properties expected after myocardial infarction [343].Fig. 11(A) Schematic illustration of the experimental setup.

        "Gelatin is derived from denaturation of collagen through its controlled hydrolysis [344]. Thus, the chemical structure of gelatin is constituted by the amino acids been glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, forming its polypeptide chains [345]. Gelatin is soluble in warm water and forms thermo-reversible hydrogels upon cooling. This property is pivotal in its applications for drug delivery systems and TE. Gelatin is also responsive to pH changes. Its biodegradability and biocompatibility further enhance its utility in various biomedical applications [346,347]. Its gel-forming, emulsifying, and foaming capabilities, extend its applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The properties and features of Gel, combined with its natural origin, position it as a valuable biomaterial with diverse functionalities in biomedical sciences [346,348].",
        "The thermo-reversible nature of gelatin facilitates the fabrication of 3D structures, crucial for mimicking the complex architecture of cardiac tissues [291]. Gelatin-based hydrogels produced using 3D printing provide a supportive environment for cell encapsulation and growth [349]. Gelatin-based hydrogels cross-linked with the biocompatible agent genipin, were developed as scaffolds for cardiac cell culture studies [349]. Using a microcontact printing technique, microstructured gelatin-based hydrogels were fabricated to promote the alignment and maturation of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Additionally, graphene oxide (GO) was incorporated into the gelatin matrix to enhance cardiomyocyte functionality [349]. The results demonstrated that micropatterned genipin-cross-linked gelatin hydrogels contributed to the alignment and maturation of cardiomyocytes, while the presence of GO further improved functional performance, leading to synchronized contractions lasting up to 3 months [349]. Moreover, Tijore et al. [350] developed a 3D bioprinted microchannel gelatin hydrogel that enhanced human mesenchymal stem cell commitment to myocardial lineage and supported native cardiomyocytes functionality (Fig. 12A). The study investigated the effects of microchannel hydrogel on hMSC alignment, elongation, and differentiation, revealing well-defined F-actin anisotropy and elongated cell morphology [350]. Aligned stem cells showed increased myocardial lineage commitment, confirmed by mature cardiac markers and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (Fig. 12B). Zhang et al. [291] also developed gelatin-based hydrogels crosslinked with genipin as scaffolds for cell culture. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes demonstrated synchronous beating within 2 days on these hydrogels. Additionally, electrical stimulation was employed to enhance cardiomyocyte maturation (Fig. 12C), resulting in improved sarcomere organization, gap junction establishment, calcium-handling capacity, and pacing signal propagation (Fig. 12D) [291]. This system holds promise for promoting physiological maturation in engineered cardiac tissues, contributing to advancements in cardiac TE [291].Fig. 12(A) 3D bioprinting and characterization of gelatin hydrogel features.

        "Electrospinning technology was also used to fabricate biocompatible gelatin-based fibrous scaffolds mimicking cardiac tissues. In a study, three types of electrospun scaffolds including furfuryl-gelatin (f-gelatin) alone, f-gelatin mixed with polycaprolactone (PCL), and coaxial scaffolds with PCL (core) and f-gelatin (sheath) were developed. Scaffolds were fabricated through single-nozzle or coaxial electrospinning to achieve uniform fibrous structures with varied average fiber diameters (760 ± 80 nm for f-gelatin, 420 ± 110 nm for f-gelatin/PCL, and 810 ± 60 nm for coaxial f-gelatin > PCL) [351]. Despite the absence of polymer interactions in blended scaffolds, differences in elastic moduli were significant, with coaxial f-gelatin > PCL having the highest one (164 ± 3.85 kPa) [351]. The coaxial scaffold demonstrated superior biocompatibility with hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, highlighting its potential for cardiac tissue-on-a-chip models. The study showcased a simple method to produce nanofibrous scaffolds that are biodegradable and crosslinkable under visible light [351].",
        "Fibrin is an important protein in the clotting cascade, playing a fundamental role in wound healing and tissue repair. It is formed through the proteolytic cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin, resulting in the polymerization of fibrin monomers into a mesh-like network [268]. This 3D fibrin matrix can provide a supportive environment for cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Additionally, fibrin mechanical properties, such as flexibility and visco-elasticity, can be leveraged to develop hydrogels that closely mimic the mechanical properties of natural tissues [352]. Fibrin exhibits remarkable biocompatibility and biodegradability, contributing to its widespread use in TE. Its ability to be easily manipulated and functionalized further enhances its utility in creating scaffolds for various regenerative medicine applications, particularly in cardiac 10.13039/100024656TE, where fibrin-based hydrogels have shown promise in supporting cell survival and tissue regeneration [242]. Fibrin is commonly used in cardiac 10.13039/100024656TE hydrogels due to its ability to support cell attachment and proliferation [242,353]. However, a major challenge is its rapid degradation by various cell types, which can undermine the structural integrity and longevity of the hydrogel scaffold. This fast degradation may result in inadequate support for regenerating cardiac tissue, potentially hindering the success of the 10.13039/100024656TE process [354]. To overcome this, researchers are investigating cross-linking techniques and modifications aimed at slowing the degradation rate while preserving the beneficial properties of fibrin [[353], [354], [355]].",
        "Fibrin-based hydrogels can be designed using methods like 3D printing and electrospinning to create structures that mimic the native cardiac tissue environment [353,356,357]. Kumar et al. [357] developed a fibrin-enhanced gelatin-based bioink to fabricate cardiac cell-laden constructs using hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. The bioink incorporated platelet-rich fibrin and improved bioactivity, with a two-step cross-linking process involving visible light cross-linking of furfuryl-gelatin and fibrinogen cross-linking via thrombin and calcium chloride [357]. The resulting constructs exhibited a porous, stable network and supported long-term in vitro culture. Printed cardiomyocytes demonstrated high viability, proliferation, and troponin I marker expression. Additionally, the constructs enabled cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts coculture, crucial for cardiac wall physiology, with applications in drug screening and heart disease modeling [357]. Sreerekha et al. [356] developed a multiscale electrospun composite scaffold based on fibrin and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) for myocardial regeneration (Fig. 13A). Leveraging the biological potential of fibrin, the scaffold provided an ideal environment for cell attachment and proliferation [356]. SEM micrographs revealed greater cell attachment on PLGA–fibrin fibers than on pure PLGA fibers, with MSCs spreading more on the composite fibers after 24 h compared to pure PLGA (Fig. 13B). Cell viability assays showed that MSCs maintained normal morphology on both scaffolds after 24 h, but those on PLGA–fibrin exhibited better survival and proliferation, with fewer dead cells observed at both 24 and 72 h (Fig. 13C) [356]. Cardiomyocyte differentiation was evaluated using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, which revealed that cells cultured on PLGA–fibrin scaffolds expressed higher levels of cardiac markers, including α-sarcomeric actinin, cardiac troponin, and tropomyosin, compared to those grown on pure PLGA scaffolds. After 14 days in differentiation medium, MSCs on PLGA–fibrin scaffolds showed differentiation into myogenic cells, as evidenced by confocal microscopy images (Fig. 13D) [356].Fig. 13(A) Schematic representation of simultaneous electrospinning of fibrin and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) onto a rotating mandrel.

        "Elastin is a key structural protein that contributes to the elasticity and resilience of various tissues in the human body [358]. It is rich in lysine-derived cross-links, which contribute to its elastic properties [243,358]. The remarkable elasticity of elastin arises from its ability to recoil after being stretched, attributed to the inherent properties of its molecular structure [359]. Elastin functionality extends beyond its mechanical properties. It interacts with other ECM components, such as fibrillin and collagen, influencing tissue organization and strength. Moreover, elastin is involved in cell signaling, impacting cellular behavior and tissue homeostasis [92,360].",
        "Incorporating elastin into hydrogel formulations enhances their mechanical properties, mirroring the elasticity of native cardiac tissues [243]. Through 3D printing technologies, elastin-rich hydrogels can be precisely engineered to mimic the complex architecture of the heart. This aids in the fabrication of scaffolds with tailored elasticity, promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, and overall functionality [269]. Furthermore, elastin not only influences cell behavior through interactions with other ECM components but also contributes to tissue organization and cell signaling. Its multifaceted involvement enhances the microenvironment for cardiac cells, promoting survival and supporting tissue regeneration [269,361]. A research work demonstrated the use of recombinant human tropoelastin as a highly biocompatible and elastic bioink for 3D printing [244]. Vascularized elastin-based cardiac constructs have been bioprinted, exhibiting endothelium barrier function and spontaneous beating of cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo. The bioink specifically consisted of two ECM-derived biopolymers: gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and methacryloyl-substituted recombinant human tropoelastin (MeTro) [244]. Cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, and HUVECs were encapsulated within the MeTro/GelMA bioink for 3D bioprinting of constructs containing multiple cell types (Fig. 14A). The constructs showed minimal inflammatory responses and efficient in vivo biodegradation when subcutaneously implanted in rats. This highlighted the potential of the elastic bioink for 3D printing functional cardiac tissues (Fig. 14A) [244]. Wang et al. [362] designed a 3D collagen-elastin scaffold emulating heart valve ECM encapsulated valve interstitial cells (VICs) and cultured valve endothelial cells (VECs) to create an in vitro 3D VEC-VIC co-culture. Cells aligned more prominently as cultures became highly confluent, orienting parallel to each other along their long axis, possibly influenced by collagen fiber orientation (Fig. 14B). This alignment, observed from day 3 onwards, reflected sustained cell elongation and enhanced with culture confluence. Over 7 days, VICs exhibited stable integrin β1 expression and proliferation with altered morphology. VECs maintained endothelial phenotype up to day 5, transforming to mesenchymal phenotype by day 7 (Fig. 14C). The fabricated 3D collagen-elastin scaffolds proved being a valuable biomaterial for studying cell interactions, advancing valvular endothelial cell research [362].Fig. 14(A) 3D bioprinting of cell-laden constructs using MeTro/GelMA bioink.

        "Silk fibroin, a natural protein derived from silkworms, exhibits a unique crystalline structure, imparting exceptional strength, toughness and stability suitable for various biomedical applications [221,245,363,364]. Silk fibroin-based hydrogels are gaining significant interest in cardiac TE due to their interesting biocompatibility, biodegradability and mechanical properties. These hydrogels provide a supportive scaffold that can mimic the natural ECM, promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation [363,365]. Additionally, silk fibroin low immunogenicity and tunability make it an ideal candidate for creating customized tissue constructs. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of silk fibroin hydrogels in enhancing cardiac tissue repair and regeneration, offering a promising approach for treating heart diseases [42,363,365].",
        "Silk fibroin-based materials can be processed into different forms including fibers, films, hydrogels [366,367]. A research study presented a fully aqueous process for fabricating conductive carbon nanotube/silk fibroin (CNT/silk) electrospun scaffolds. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the nanofibers in all the study groups exhibited a smooth and bead-free morphology (Fig. 15A), indicating the interesting electrospinnability of the solutions. The well-dispersed CNT enhanced scaffold conductivity without compromising biocompatibility [368]. Culturing neonatal rat cardiomyocytes on these scaffolds resulted in improved cell spreading and increased expression of cardiac-specific proteins. Aligned CNT/silk fibroin composite scaffolds guided the oriented organization of cardiac tissues, mimicking natural sarcomeres and gap junctions (Fig. 15B). This aqueous processing method showed great potential for supporting the formation of enhanced functional cardiac tissues [368]. In another study, a biodegradable polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin (PVA/SF) nanofibrous heart patch with unique tensile properties was crafted using an electrospinning technique in a water-solvent system [42]. Patches with pronounced and interconnected composite fibrous structures were achieved, with enhanced mechanical properties and tunable degradation rates. Culturing human cardiac fibroblast cells on these patches demonstrated favorable cell proliferation and attachment on the bio-interface [42]. Moreover, Mehrotra et al. [369] developed a novel, mechanically robust nonmulberry silk fibroin bioink [369]. The developed nonmulberry silk fibroin (n-SF) based ink consisted of n-SF, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) and GelMA as its major components. The silk fibroin-based bioink exhibited suitable mechanical properties, including suitable elasticity and stiffness (≈40 kPa), essential for constructing clinically relevant cardiac tissue constructs. Through a dual crosslinking method, this ink was used for the fabrication of anisotropic scaffolds that supported the formation of aligned sarcomeres and maintained synchronized beating of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 15C). Macrophages released pro-inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1β, NO) when exposed to the constructs, showing low immunogenicity comparable to GelMA and tissue culture plates (TCP). In vivo implantation in rats demonstrated minimal macrophage infiltration, with fibroblasts predominant in the zone of interaction with the host tissue interaction (Fig. 15D) [369]. In the field of vascularized myocardial tissue-on-a-chip fabrication, the silk-based ink has served as a supporting hydrogel for encapsulating human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac spheroids (hiPSC-CSs) and fabricating perfusable vascularized channels through embedded bioprinting. The silk-based hydrogel demonstrated its capability to support the maturation and viability of hiPSC-CSs and endothelial cells, offering a versatile platform for drug toxicity evaluation in cardiac 10.13039/100024656TE [369]. 3D scaffolds were fabricated through electrospinning and microfluidics, incorporating silk fibroin nanofibers and uniform microspheres. The resulting bridge-shaped structures featured nanofibers (250–350 nm in diameter) doped with microspheres (2–10 μm) [370]. Endothelial cells (ECs) were seeded on these 3D microsphere-nanofiber silk fibroin scaffolds with a mean fiber diameter of 300 nm. Notably, a 10 % higher cell proliferation ratio was observed compared to microporous and sponge-like SF scaffolds made through freeze-drying [370]. Moreover, gene transcript levels, such as CD146, VE-C, and PECAM-1, showed superior preservation on the 3D microsphere-nanofiber silk fibroin scaffolds, which hierarchical structure is promising for cardiovascular TE [370]. Patra et al. [363] investigated the potential of non-mulberry silk fibroin from Antheraea mylitta as a scaffold for cardiac TE. Testing 3-day postnatal rat cardiomyocytes, they assessed cell adhesion, metabolic activity, extracellular response, cell communication, and contractility [363]. The results showed that A. mylitta silk fibroin exhibited properties comparable to fibronectin, a key matrix component for cardiomyocytes, and outperformed mulberry Bombyx mori silk fibroin due to its RGD domains. Additionally, cardiomyocytes loaded onto A. mylitta 3D scaffolds formed contractile patches. These findings demonstrated that silk fibroin is a promising material for engineering functional cardiac patches [363]. In another study, Liu et al. [371] designed a biomimetic nanofiber electrospun membrane with a sandwich structure. The composite patch consisted of a stretchable polyurethane (PU) base, a middle layer of biocompatible silk fibroin methacryloyl (Silk-MA) via electrospinning, and a surface layer of Bio-ILs (biocompatible ionic liquids) for electrical conductivity [371]. The incorporation of Bio-ILs significantly enhanced electrical conductivity to 2877 mS/m and provided mild adhesive properties, minimizing tissue damage. The PU layer increased film stretchability to 250 %, while Silk-MA made the film hydrophilic, promoting a biocompatible microenvironment. In vitro cell experiments using H9c2 cells seeded on the developed membranes demonstrated low cytotoxicity and excellent biocompatibility, making the membrane a promising solution for cardiac TE [371].Fig. 15(A) SEM images showing surface morphology of silk and CNT/silk scaffolds.

        "Silk-based biomaterials can be genetically engineered to enhance their properties. Recombinant silk, produced through genetic engineering in organisms like bacteria or yeast, includes proteins such as fibroin [363,368] or eADF4(C16) [365,372,373]. These engineered silk proteins are used to create materials with tailored properties for diverse applications, including cardiac TE. In this field, recombinant silk proteins serve as scaffolds to support the growth and organization of cardiomyocytes [363,365,368,372]. These scaffolds mimic the heart natural environment, promoting cell attachment and growth. Being biocompatible, they avoid adverse bodily reactions and possess mechanical properties suitable for the contractile activity of heart cells [363,372]. A notable example is the eADF4(C16)-RGD protein, which supports cardiomyocyte attachment and beating, highlighting its potential for developing artificial cardiac tissues. Such materials could aid in repairing heart damage after events like heart attacks, offering a pathway to restore cardiac function [365,372].",
        "In summary, the integration of polysaccharides, proteins and other biopolymers in the development of fiber/hydrogels for cardiac TE offers considerable potential, but each material comes with its own set of advantages and limitations. Polysaccharides are highly biocompatible and biodegradable, making them ideal for supporting tissue regeneration as they can mimic the natural ECM [41]. Their inherent biological properties promote cell growth and tissue formation, which is important for cardiac repair. However, their generally non-conductive nature presents a significant challenge for cardiac TE, as heart tissue relies on electrical conductivity for coordinated contractions [40,41,271]. This limitation can be addressed by combining these polysaccharides with electroconductive additives allowing them to support electrical signals and enhance cardiac tissue functionality [53,96,280]. In addition, proteins are also widely used due to their strong bioactivity, promoting cell adhesion, proliferation and signaling essential for tissue regeneration [232,353,363,374]. Proteins play a suitable role in ECM of cardiac tissue, providing both structural support and biochemical signals that regulate cellular behavior essential for tissue function and repair. Their mechanical properties, such as stiffness and elasticity as well as their degradation rates can be finely tuned to match the dynamic mechanical environment of the heart, making them highly adaptable for cardiac applications [336,353,374]. When combined with polysaccharides, protein materials can get improved mechanical strength and bioactivity in hydrogels, resulting in a more balanced and functional matrix for cardiac TE [60,279,355]. The synthetic polymers even if they offer highly tunable mechanical properties, they may pose biocompatibility challenges, as they could provoke inflammatory responses or fail to integrate seamlessly with surrounding tissues [129,182,216,324,325,375]. Additionally, many synthetic polymers lack biodegradability, meaning they may need to be removed after tissue integration, potentially complicating their use in long-term applications [41,376]. Incorporating electrically conductive components into biopolymer-based hydrogels presents an exciting opportunity to address the electrical conductivity issue and further enhance their biological functionality. These conductive elements can facilitate electrical stimulation, which is important for promoting the growth and proliferation of cardiac cells in electrically conductive biopolymer-based hydrogels as well as tissue maturation, ultimately improving the performance of engineered cardiac patches [90,368,374,377,378]. The incorporation of electrically conductive materials into biopolymer-based hydrogels for cardiac TE must be precisely regulated to improve the electrical conductivity of the composite, while preserving cardiac cell functionality during cell culture and tissue formation [96,379]. Excessive incorporation of these electroconductive materials may induce cytotoxic effects, adversely affecting cell viability and physiological function. Conversely, insufficient content of conductive materials in biopolymer-based hydrogels can result in inadequate electrical conductivity of resulting composites, impeding effective signal transmission and synchronization of cardiac cells, which is essential for replicating the natural electrophysiological properties of heart tissues [60,96,114,368,374,377]. Therefore, fine tuning both the content and spatial distribution of conductive components within the hydrogels is essential to achieve an optimal balance between enhanced electrical conductivity and the maintenance of a biocompatible microenvironment conducive to cardiac cell survival and function [368,374,377].",
        "In cardiac TE, it has been extensively explored the integration of electrically conductive materials into biopolymer-based composite hydrogels [54,55,114,257,368]. This section highlights the role of electroconductive materials including conductive polymers, carbon-based materials and metal nanoparticles in enhancing electrical signaling for TE cardiac biomaterials as well as their promising applications in this field. Cellular interactions in electroconductive hydrogels are crucial in TE, where the combination of electroconductive materials and functional biomaterials creates a dynamic environment that significantly impacts cell behavior. These hydrogels offer a unique platform for orchestrating cellular responses [96,378,380]. Central to this interaction is the cell ability to sense and respond to electrical, biochemical, and mechanical cues, mimicking physiological conditions. The electrical conductivity of these hydrogels not only facilitates efficient signal transduction but also plays a pivotal role in influencing cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation [381,382]. In addition, the electrical conductivity of the hydrogel enhances integrin-mediated adhesion, influencing the strength and stability of cell-substrate interactions [383]. Importantly, the conductivity of the hydrogel also plays a role in promoting cell adhesion by providing electrical cues that can influence cell behavior and signal transduction pathways involved in adhesion, migration, and differentiation [384,385]. As cells adhere and spread on the conductive hydrogel, they establish an interconnected network, forming a three-dimensional framework akin to the native tissue microenvironment. This spatial organization plays a leading role in facilitating cell signaling, nutrient exchange, and the development of cell-cell interactions [386].",
        "Conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PANi) [60,180], poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) [90,378], and PPy [375,387], have garnered significant interest in the field of cardiac TE. They exhibit suitable electrical conductivity, mechanical flexibility, and biocompatibility, making them promising candidates for the development of biomaterials for cardiac TE applications.",
        "PANi is a synthetic polymer with notable electrical conductivity, making it well-suited for applications in cardiovascular TE [388]. Additionally, its inherent biocompatibility and favorable processability make PANi highly noteworthy [389]. This is particularly evident in applications like cardiac patch development, where PANi can contribute significantly to both the structural integrity and bioactive functionality of hydrogels [180,185]. Integrating PANi into biopolymer-based composite inks for hydrogel manufacturing allows precise control over the hydrogel electrical properties, promoting essential interactions vital for cardiac tissue development [388]. The microstructure of electrospun fiber mats containing PANi revealed homogeneous morphologies (Fig. 16A). PANi-based materials were obtained by incorporating PANi in collagen/hyaluronic acid (HA)/PANi composites [60]. Specific structures formed by phase separation and hydrogen bonding were observed in all mats, enhancing electrical conductivity, porosity, mechanical properties, and cell attachment. Quantifications revealed 60–64 % porosity, with PANi4 mats exhibiting aligned fibers (Fig. 16A) [60]. Cellular viability analysis after 48 h, revealed that PANi percentages exceeding 0.08 % in the composites decreased viability compared to collagen–HA (Fig. 16B(i,ii)) [60]. Beating behavior analysis at day 5 using muscle motion, showed a correlation between contraction duration and PANi concentration (Fig. 16C(i)). Compared to mats without PANi, PANi-based mats exhibited longer contraction times, greater amplitudes, and lower beating rates, making them more favorable for cardiac TE (Fig. 16C(ii–iv)). Graphs exhibiting speed of contraction of cells cultured in different materials demonstrated appropriate characteristics (Fig. 16C(v–x)) [60]. Electroactive and biocompatible fibrous scaffolds, composed of polyaniline (PANi) doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) along with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and PLA/poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) mixtures were also developed. The structure of both simple and core–shell fibers, obtained through uniaxial and coaxial electrospinning respectively, was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared and micro-Raman spectroscopies [185]. Morphological studies revealed that the addition of PEG improved the interactions between PLA and PANi polymeric chains, allowing for better control of fiber thickness. Both PANi and PEG affected the thermal and electrical properties of the composites, lowering the glass transition temperature and increasing electrical conductivity. Despite high cytotoxicity observed for PANi/DBSA composites, studies on PLA/PANi fibers demonstrated a reduction in harmful effects as the conducting polymer is mainly retained inside the fibers through favorable PANi/PLA interactions [185]. Morphological and functional studies with cardiac cells suggested that the fabricated fibrous scaffolds were suitable for cardiac TE [185].Fig. 16(A) Morphological characterization of electrospun collagen, collagen/HA, and collagen/HA/PANi blends.

        "The integration of PANi into composite hydrogels using 3D printing has demonstrated remarkable success in achieving suitable electrical conductivity. Through precise 3D printing methods, PANi can be distributed within hydrogel scaffolds to create a conductive network. Studies have revealed that such composite hydrogel scaffolds exhibited conductivity levels suitable for supporting the alignment and functionality of cardiomyocytes [185,391]. This is of utmost importance in cardiac TE, where the orchestrated contraction of cardiomyocytes relies on complex electrical signals. For instance, Ul Haq et al. [390] fabricated electrically conductive scaffolds mimicking the directional alignment of muscle fibers in the myocardium using 3D printing micro-stereolithography (Fig. 16D). A composite ink was formulated using polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), Irgacure 819 (photo-initiator), curcumin (dye), and PANi to enable free radical photo-polymerization [390]. The scaffold design replicated the varying angles of myofibers in the myocardium (Fig. 16E(i)), with each layer oriented accordingly (Fig. 16E(ii)). Optical images (Fig. 16E(iii–vi)) displayed the 3D-printed scaffolds, showing conductive scaffolds containing PANi with an average strand diameter of 370 ± 10 μm [390]. PANi imparted semi-conductive properties ((Fig. 16E(vii)). The scaffolds exhibited a conductivity of approximately 10−6 S/m. Structural analysis via SEM confirmed the hierarchical morphology of the scaffolds (Fig. 16F). The conductive nature of the scaffolds potentially improved the viability of mouse cardiac progenitor cells (mCPCs) compared to non-conductive scaffolds (Fig. 16G) [390].",
        "PEDOT is a conductive polymer which consists of a thiophene backbone with ethylenedioxy linkages, conferring outstanding electrical conductivity and electroactivity [392]. As a component in electrically conductive hydrogels, PEDOT can efficiently facilitate electron transport in the matrix, allowing for precise electrical signaling, vital in cardiac TE [393]. Roshanbinfar et al. [114] used PEDOT:poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) in a biohybrid hydrogel composed of collagen and alginate to engineer cardiac tissues by casting. They observed that these electroconductive biohybrid hydrogels enabled enhanced maturation and beating properties. Abedi et al. [226] developed chitosan scaffolds incorporating poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) using electrospinning technology for cardiac TE. The addition of PEDOT:PSS to the chitosan matrix not only enhanced mechanical and electrical aspects but also improved cell viability in composites. A substantial reduction in fiber diameter and a remarkable increase in electrical conductivity was achieved with a 1 wt% PEDOT:PSS content in the electrospun composites [226]. Luque et al. [394] developed a printable cardiac hydrogel to address the limited repair ability of damaged myocardium, a major contributor to myocardial cardiopathy. The hydrogel matrix was composed of poly(vinyl alcohol) cross-linked with gallic acid and PEDOT, yielding patches with suitable electrical conductivity, elasticity and mechanical strength, essential for enhancing cardiac contraction and impulse propagation [394]. The hydrogel was compatible with direct ink writing and demonstrated efficiency in propagating electrical signals in adult mouse cardiomyocytes by stimulating intracellular Ca2+ transients. Implanted in healthy mouse hearts, the patches showed biocompatibility and maintained essential cardiac function after two weeks, highlighting their therapeutic potential [394]. Roshanbinfar et al. [90] developed a collagen-PEDOT:PSS hydrogel for myocardial infarction treatment, aiming to address ventricular tachycardia (VT) and promote cardiac remuscularization. They demonstrated the use of PEDOT:PSS in hydrogels, improving collagen gel formation, micromorphology, and conductivity [90]. The combination of this bioink with hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes enhanced contractility, calcium handling, and conduction velocity, with RNA-sequencing showing improved cell maturation and matrix interactions. The hydrogel, when injected into infarcted mouse hearts, reduced VT to levels similar to healthy hearts, offering a promising platform for cardiac injury treatment [90].",
        "PPy is a leading electroconductive polymer possessing a chemical structure characterized by a conjugated backbone formed by a pyrrole monomer [221,387]. When integrated into hydrogels, PPy enhances both the mechanical and electrical properties of the composite material. Additionally, its influence extends to facilitating cell alignment, a key factor in fabricating functional and organized cardiac constructs [375]. Liang et al. [221] employed electrospinning to fabricate conductive nanofibers encapsulating PPy. The electrospun composites were prepared at different ratios PPy-to-silk fibroin. The resulting PPy-embedded mats exhibited reduced fiber diameters (0.431 ± 0.060 μm), closely resembling myocardium fibrils. Mats containing 7 % silk fibroin demonstrated interesting mechanical properties (1.437 ± 0.044 MPa) close to native myocardium and a PPy-to-silk fibroin ratio of 15:85 provided optimal electrical conductivity [221]. In this study, HL-1 cells were employed to assess biocompatibility. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were chosen for evaluating cardiac muscle contraction, due to their better contractility. Cell viability and metabolic activity of mats containing PPy, compared to those without PPy, showed interesting cytocompatibility (Fig. 17A and B). The metabolic rate of HL-1 cells increased across all groups from day 4 to day 8 (Fig. 17C). Cells cultured on PPy-containing mats showed higher absorbance compared to those on pure SF mats. NRCMs seeded PPy-silk fibroin electrospun scaffolds were examined for cell spreading [221]. The NRCMs successfully attached to and spread across the mats, interacting with PPy-silk fibroin fibers in various ways. Initially, NRCMs adhered to and grew along the fibers (Fig. 17D). They extended cellular processes to grip distant fibers, increasing their size (Fig. 17D). NRCMs not only spread on the mat surface but also extended pseudopodia beneath fibers, establishing direct cell-cell contacts (Fig. 17E) [221]. Moreover, aligned fibers were observed in limited regions of the PPy-based mats, influencing NRCM morphology and orientation (Fig. 17F). The contraction of NRCM-seeded mats was monitored. By Day 7, 7 %PPy15 mats showed stable, regular contractions (average beat per minute: 39 ± 8, displacement: 5.68 ± 0.57 μm, Fig. 17G). Mats with higher PPy content exhibited vibrations; notably, 7 %PPy40 vibrated more intensely than 7 %PPy30 (Fig. 17H and I) [221]. Another research work focused on synthesized polypyrrole nanoparticles (PPy-NP) through the mini-emulsion method, followed by their integration in a gelatin (Gel)/hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel to fabricate electroconductive Gel:HA:PPy-NP composite scaffolds for electroactive TE [241]. These scaffolds exhibited commendable mechanical properties (1.08 ± 0.26 MPa), closely matching the spinal cord performance. Designed with controlled porosity and reaching electrical conductivities of 4.3 × 10−6 ± 1.1 × 10−6 S cm−1, Gel:HA:PPy-NP scaffolds underwent 3D printing into predefined lattice geometries with suitable post-printing shape fidelity (Fig. 17J) [241]. The in vitro biological assessments of the fabricated composites demonstrated their cytocompatibility, with high viability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neuronal stem cells (NSCs) recorded as shown in Fig. 17K. MSC attachment was prominent, with cells growing in clusters in the scaffold grooves and pores [241]. The attached cells exhibited spindle-like projections, aligning with normal MSC morphology. Neuronal stem cells (NSCs) seeded and cultured on Gel:HA:PPy-NP scaffolds displayed successful attachment with visible cellular projections (Fig. 17L). Similar to MSCs, NSCs formed clusters on the scaffold surface, determined by the scaffold topography [241].Fig. 17(A–I) Cardiomyocytes (CMs) on electrospun (PPy, SF) mats.

        "Carbon-based materials, specifically carbon nanotubes and graphene are remarkable components for fabricating electroconductive hydrogels [53,55,374,377,395].",
        "Carbon nanotubes are cylindrical structures composed of carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal patterns, forming single or multiple layers. The two main types of CNTs are single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (Fig. 18A). SWCNTs consist of a single layer of carbon atoms composed of sp2 hybridized carbon, resembling a rolled-up graphene sheet, while MWCNTs comprise multiple concentric layers [396]. The specific arrangement of carbon atoms imparts remarkable mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties to CNTs. The ballistic transport of electrons along the length of the nanotubes contributes to their superior conductive properties [397]. In addition, the tensile strength of CNTs render them invaluable for reinforcing the mechanical properties of hydrogels. Aside from their notable electrical conductivity, CNTs possess unique electronic and optical properties that render them instrumental in the development of electronic devices [396,398]. The high aspect ratio of CNTs facilitates the formation of a network-like structure in composites, even at low concentrations. This structural arrangement further enhances their utility in various potential applications, underlining the versatility of CNTs in electronic and structural domains [399]. However, the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in hydrogels for cardiac TE can present several challenges and risks, particularly regarding their potential cytotoxicity. CNTs can enter cells through endocytosis or mechanically pierce the cell membrane like needles, leading to potential cellular damage and disruption of normal cellular functions, which can result in cell death [400,401]. These nanomaterials have sharp, rigid, and elongated structures that may mechanically puncture the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, potentially resulting in cell damage or death. Additionally, their small size enables easy penetration into tissues, which could trigger localized inflammation or oxidative stress through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, lysosomal disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction, and eventual cell death through apoptosis or necrosis [402,403]. While CNTs can improve the electrical conductivity and mechanical properties of hydrogels, their long-term biocompatibility is still uncertain. There is a significant concern about chronic inflammation and immune responses, which could impair the healing process and interfere with the integration of engineered tissue with the host myocardium. The risk of chronic toxicity and adverse immune reactions remains a major obstacle in ensuring the safe and effective use of CNT-based hydrogels for cardiac tissue regeneration [400,404]. Despite these disadvantages, upon integration into hydrogel matrices, CNTs significantly enhance electrical conductivity, playing an important role in the development of electrically conductive hydrogels tailored for TE [55,96,405]. The synergistic incorporation of CNTs into hydrogels imparts a dual advantage, reinforcing the mechanical integrity of the scaffold and endowing it with electrical conductivity. The resulting composite material could mimic the native myocardium more closely, facilitating optimal cell alignment and contractility [374]. The enhanced electrical properties enable efficient signal propagation, fostering synchronized cellular responses within the engineered cardiac tissue [55,374,406].Fig. 18(A) Nanostructures of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (left) and single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).

        "Mombini et al. [407] fabricated electrospun nanofiber scaffolds, comprising polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), chitosan, and varied CNT concentrations offering a biomimetic environment resembling the native cardiac tissue matrix [407]. An optimized PVA-CHI-CNT scaffold, incorporating 1 % CNT, demonstrated exceptional properties: an elastic modulus of 130 ± 3.605 MPa, electrical conductivity of 3.4 × 10−6 S/cm, high-water uptake, high cell adhesion, and over 80 % cell viability. Subsequent differentiation of rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into cardiomyocytes on the optimal scaffold, aided by electrical stimulation, significantly increased cardiac marker expression [407]. Gerasimenko et al. [408] developed a laser-based printing technology to fabricate structures from composite layers of lyophilized bovine serum albumin (BSA), bovine collagen (BC), and chitosan succinate (CS) with single‐walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) for cardiovascular devices and TE implants [408]. SEM images revealed smooth surfaces for biopolymer composites, with increased roughness and porosity upon laser exposure at various energy thresholds (Eth) (Fig. 18B). Notably, bimodal pore distribution with large pores (100–200 μm) and small pores (1–5 μm) was achieved for BSA/BC/CS with SWCNT at specific Eth values, crucial for cell adhesion, proliferation, vascularization, and innervation processes (Fig. 18B) [408]. Laser-fabricated composite layers demonstrated higher conductivity, maximum hardness, and improved endothelial cell viability compared to thermostat layers. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed cell compatibility, highlighting the potential of these composite layers for tissue regeneration from implantation (Fig. 18C) [408]. Gelatin (Gel) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were used to physico-chemically and biologically modify polyurethane nanofibers followed by the application of electrospinning, a versatile technique for producing functional nanoscale fibers [409]. Mean diameters of nanofibrous Gel/SWCNTs scaffolds from 210 to 140 nm were obtained, impacting initial cell behavior [409]. Scaffold degradation was tailored by incorporating gelatin, contributing to biomimetic mechanical properties resembling normal blood vessels. SWNTs enhanced the Young's modulus and ultimate strength, reaching 16.47 ± 0.5 and 23.73 ± 0.5 MPa, respectively, while gelatin increased elongation at break. SWCNTs significantly improved electrical conductivity. Biological evaluation confirmed dense cell coverage after 7 days, indicating the potential effectiveness of these scaffolds for cardiovascular TE [409]. Furthermore, Kharaziha et al. [410] developed enhanced electrical properties in tough and flexible hybrid scaffolds by embedding CNTs within aligned poly(glycerol sebacate) (PG):gelatin electrospun nanofibers to mimic the native myocardium ECM (Fig. 18D). Gelatin cross-linking using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide [410]. Varying 10.13039/100019926CNT concentrations in PG-based nanofibrous scaffolds (10.13039/100019926CNT/PG scaffolds) significantly improved fiber alignment, electrical conductivity, and toughness while supporting cardiomyocyte (CM) viability, alignment, and contractile activities. CNT-PG scaffolds exhibited stronger beating behavior, lower excitation thresholds, and higher capture rates than PG scaffolds (Fig. 18D) [410]. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated well-developed sarcomeric structures and enhanced Cx43 expression on CNT/PG scaffolds, indicating improved cell coupling and contractile properties (Fig. 18D). The aligned CNT/PG scaffold showcased superior mechanical properties compared to those of PG scaffolds, emphasizing its potential for generating well-organized and mature cardiac tissues [410].",
        "Graphene is a carbon-based material consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, forming a two-dimensional honeycomb pattern. It exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity and has a large surface area [411,412]. In addition, graphene possesses outstanding mechanical properties. Ideally, its Young's modulus can reach 1 TPa, and its tensile strength can reach 130 GPa [413,414]. Moreover, graphene is known for its outstanding flexibility, allowing it to bend and stretch without losing structural integrity. When graphene is incorporated into hydrogels, it enhances the overall performance of the composite material with its advantageous properties [415]. The integration of graphene in biomaterials enhances electrical coupling, a crucial factor in the development of functional cardiac tissue constructs.",
        "Chemical modifications particularly oxidation and reduction, play a crucial role in tailoring graphene for the development of hydrogels with enhanced functional properties in cardiac TE [115]. These functional groups can enhance interactions with biomolecules and other components, facilitating the integration of graphene into complex hydrogel networks. In addition, these modifications also improve the dispersibility of graphene in aqueous solutions, preventing aggregation and enhancing its integration into the hydrogel matrix [115]. Graphene oxide (GO) is initially produced through oxidation, introducing oxygen-containing functional groups such as hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl moieties onto graphene sheets. The resulting GO exhibits improved hydrophilicity, facilitating its integration into hydrogel matrices [416]. While GO exhibits improved hydrophilicity and dispersibility in aqueous solutions, it inherently compromises electrical conductivity due to disruptions in the sp2 hybridization [417]. To enhance the mechanical and electrical properties of hydrogels, GO is subsequently reduced to form reduced graphene oxide (rGO). This reduction process removes some oxygen functionalities, partially restoring the sp2 carbon network and increasing electrical conductivity [418]. Fig. 19A displays the structure of graphene, GO and rGO. The controlled balance achieved through oxidation and reduction allows for the optimization of graphene-based hydrogels, ensuring improved mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and biocompatibility. These tailored hydrogels, laden with rGO, provide a supportive environment for cardiac tissue regeneration, promoting cell adhesion, alignment, and maturation [419,420].Fig. 19(A) Schematic representation of the structures of graphene, GO, and rGO.

        "Zhao et al. [421] conducted a research study aiming to develop silk nanofibrous biomaterials modified with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to guide the formation of electrically interconnected networks in excitable tissues. Silk fibroin solutions were electrospun with a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solution, and rGO solutions at various concentrations were applied onto the electrospun silk mat to achieve controlled rGO coating densities [421]. Various rGO/silk scaffolds were synthesized in this study. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed a gradual blurring of the nanofibrous morphology in the rGO/silk materials as the rGO coating thickness increased (Fig. 19B). The composite nanofibrous scaffolds, applied for cardiac TE, demonstrated the ability to promote cardiomyocyte growth and proliferation, tissue formation, expression of cardiac-specific proteins, and the formation of sarcomeric structures and gap junctions (Fig. 19C–D) [421]. External electrical stimulation further enhanced the maturation of cardiomyocytes cultured on these scaffolds (Fig. 19D). The results highlighted the potential of rGO-functionalized silk biomaterials to mimic electrical microenvironments for regenerating functional excitable tissues [421]. Arici et al. [422] developed carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)/gelatin (Gel)/graphene oxide (GO)-based scaffolds using extrusion-based 3D printing for cardiac tissue regeneration. SEM images of 3D printed scaffolds achieved are shown in Fig. 19E and images after 28 days of incubation in PBS buffer are shown in Fig. 19F. Rheological studies indicated that CMC enhanced the viscosity and printability of the inks. The printed cardiac patches were crosslinked using different concentrations of 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), and their mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, contact angle, and degradation rates were analyzed [422]. Cell culture studies with H9c2 cardiomyoblasts showed good cell viability, with the optimal EDC/NHS concentration producing stable, flexible, and stiff scaffolds. The patches exhibited increased flexibility and mechanical strength compared to those that did not incorporate graphene, with CMC/Gel/GO patches showing improved electrical conductivity (7.0 × 10−3 S cm−1), making them suitable for mimicking native myocardium. The addition of GO and higher CMC concentrations significantly improved cell viability (Fig. 19G) [422].",
        "Metal nanoparticles, including the silver and gold ones, play a vital role in augmenting the properties of electrically conductive hydrogels for cardiac TE [54,377,[424], [425], [426]].",
        "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) exhibit a range of physicochemical attributes that make them particularly appealing for biomedical applications [427]. With diameters typically ranging from 1 to 100 nm, AgNPs offer a high surface area-to-volume ratio, optical tunability and potent antimicrobial properties [428,429]. The combination of their electrical conductivity and intrinsic antimicrobial properties positions them as valuable assets in addressing infection-related concerns in cardiac applications [427]. Research studies illustrated the efficacy of AgNPs in preventing bacterial contamination in hydrogels. AgNPs actively inhibited bacterial growth [430,431]. The synergistic combination of hydrogel flexibility and the enhanced strength imparted by AgNPs results in a scaffold capable of withstanding the dynamic mechanical forces inherent in the cardiac environment, providing a supportive matrix for cell growth and tissue organization [377]. Studies have also suggested that AgNPs can contribute to angiogenesis. The pro-angiogenic effects of AgNPs-based hydrogels enhance their utility in promoting a vascularized cardiac microenvironment [432].",
        "AgNPs have recently emerged as interesting candidates for improving the electrical and mechanical characteristics of non-conductive scaffolds in cardiac TE through the fabrication of electroconductive nanocomposites [377]. Allison et al. [433] designed electrospun collagen-fibrous materials containing spherical AgNPs. The resulting composite displayed comparable morphology to the control (without AgNPs) but exhibited improved electrical conductivity (Fig. 20A). The incorporation of AgNPs resulted in an eightfold increase in the electrical conductivity of the fibers (Fig. 20A) [433]. Under electrical stimulation using chronic paced electrical cell stimulation system (CPACE® system), cells cultured on AgNPs-containing fibrous materials increased Cx43 expression and neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. Collagen fibers, with and without AgNPs, exhibited α-sarcomeric actinin (α-SA) expression, maintaining cardiomyocyte phenotype effectively (Fig. 20B(i)) [433]. Cx43 expression was notably doubled in cells seeded on fibers containing AgNPs that were electrically stimulated, while significantly lower Cx43 levels were observed in non-paced samples (Fig. 20B(ii)). These composites also prevented biofilm formation and did not activate macrophages [433]. Nazari et al. [377] synthesized reduced graphene oxide-silver (rGO-Ag) nanocomposites (1 and 2 wt%) and incorporated them into polyurethane (PU) nanofibers using the electrospinning technique. Human cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs) were then seeded on these scaffolds for in vitro studies [377]. In vitro studies using PU and PU/nanocomposites scaffolds revealed good cytocompatibility of hCPCs, confirmed by MTT assay and scanning electron microscopy studies showing cell attachment (Fig. 20C) [377]. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunostaining demonstrated upregulated cardiac-specific genes in the PU/rGO-Ag scaffolds, including GATA-4, T-box 18 (TBX 18), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), and alpha-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC), compared to neat PU (Fig. 20D), indicating the potential of these nanofibrous rGO-Ag–reinforced PU scaffolds for cardiac tissue repair [377].Fig. 20(A) (i) Images of collagen fibers with and without silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) used for electrical conductivity measurement, (ii) Electrical conductivity results for collagen fibers with and without AgNPs.

        "Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are recognized for their significant potential in enhancing the fabrication of electrically conductive hydrogels [425]. AuNPs are composed of gold atoms arranged in a nanoscale configuration, with size typically ranging from 1 to 100 nm. Their properties include a high surface area-to-volume ratio and surface plasmon resonance, making them conducive for interaction with electromagnetic fields [434]. The surface of AuNPs can be functionalized with various molecules, enabling tailored interactions with surrounding environments [435]. AuNPs exhibit tunable electrical conductivity, providing researchers with a powerful tool to finely adjust the electrical properties of hydrogel matrices [325,436]. Research studies have demonstrated the ability to modulate the electrical conductivity of AuNPs by adjusting their size, shape or surface chemistry. This tunability ensures that the hydrogel precisely meets the specific electrical requirements for fostering cellular communication and tissue regeneration [54,437]. Recently, a biohybrid hydrogel was developed to enhance the beating properties of engineered cardiac tissues and enable drug release [54]. AuNPs of various sizes (18–241 nm) and surface charges (33.9–55.4 mV), synthesized using branched polyethyleneimine (bPEI) increased gel stiffness from 91 to 146 kPa and enhanced electrical conductivity from 40 to 49–68 mS cm−1 (Fig. 21A) [54]. These electroconductive hydrogels, when combined with hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, exhibited enhanced beating, improved sarcomere alignment, and advanced electrical coupling, with synchronous calcium flux (Fig. 21B). RNA-seq confirmed these findings, demonstrating the potential of bPEI-AuNP-collagen hydrogels for improving cardiac TE and possibly treating other electrically sensitive tissues [54]. Moreover, AuNPs-based hydrogels exhibit interesting biocompatibility, making them suitable candidates for cardiac TE [425,426]. The physicochemical properties of AuNPs, such as their stability and the ability to be functionalized with biocompatible polymers contribute to favorable interactions with biological tissues [438].Fig. 21(A) Microstructure and electrical conductivity of bPEI-AuNP-collagen hydrogels.

        "Zhu et al. [439] developed a novel bioink incorporating gold nanorods (GNRs) into gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA). The gold nanocomposite bioink, which included GelMA and alginate with commercial cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-coated gold nanorods (G-GNRs), showed broad compatibility with 3D bioprinting systems, including those using coaxial extrusion needles (Fig. 21C) [439]. Coextrusion of bioink and calcium chloride resulted in ionically crosslinked hydrogel microfibers. This GNR-infused bioink optimally balanced viscosity and GNR concentration to create a conducive microenvironment for cardiac cell spreading and organization (Fig. 21C). The resulting nanocomposite bioink allowed for easy integration of cells at high densities, facilitating rapid, high-resolution deposition of cell-laden fibers while minimizing shear stress [439]. In this study, cardiac TE involved co-printing neonatal rat cardiac cells in G-GNR nanocomposite bioink. Homogeneous encapsulation was confirmed (Fig. 21D), with subsequent culture resulting in well-spread and highly confluent cells within the construct by day 12 (Fig. 21D). G-GNR constructs demonstrated higher Cx-43 expression and synchronized contractile frequency, indicating improved electrical coupling and contractile properties (Fig. 21D) [439]. Electrospinning was also used to fabricate gold-based biomaterial hydrogels for cardiac TE. To tackle the challenge of integrating cardiac patches without causing additional damage to the infarcted heart, Malki et al. [440] developed a suture-free methodology using nanocomposite scaffolds. The scaffolds, consisting of albumin protein electrospun fibers and gold nanorods (AuNRs), hosted cardiac cells to form a functional patch. Placed on the myocardium, the engineered tissue underwent near infrared laser irradiation at 808 nm [440]. The AuNRs absorbed the light, converting it into thermal energy. This localized energy altered the molecular structure of the fibrous scaffold, securely attaching it to the heart wall without causing harm. These hybrid biomaterials offer a promising solution for integrating engineered tissues into damaged organs, thereby reducing the risks associated with traditional stitching methods and additional patient injury [440]. In another work, electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated from polyurethane, chitosan, collagen, and saffron extract-synthesized AuNPs. Successful synthesis of AuNPs was confirmed by UV–Vis spectroscopy, with nanoparticles exhibiting a hydrodynamic size of approximately 13 nm and a zeta potential of −37 mV [441]. The biocompatibility of the prepared scaffolds was evaluated by seeding HUVEC cells on the nanofibers, followed by an alamar blue assay at 1, 3, and 5 days post-seeding. The results showed that all scaffolds exhibited good cytocompatibility with good cell survival. Additionally, the presence of saffron extract-synthesized AuNPs at the surface of nanofibers reduced contact angles and enhanced surface hydrophilicity, facilitating cell attachment and proliferation due to their topological features. AuNPs also contributed to minimal inflammatory responses and improved biocompatibility of AuNPs-based nanofibers [441].",
        "To enhance the efficacy of hydrogels for cardiac TE, it is necessary to add bioactive functionalities by incorporating bioactive molecules and materials into the hydrogels. Foremost, hydrogels must exhibit high biocompatibility and support cell survival and function. Biocompatible hydrogels minimize adverse reactions and inflammation, fostering a conducive environment for cardiac cell integration. Materials such as natural polymers (e.g., collagen, chitosan, cellulose, gelatin and hyaluronic acid) and synthetic polymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol) have been widely explored for their biocompatibility [40,41,63,442]. Furthermore, incorporation of biochemical factors could be necessary to mimic the native cardiac microenvironment. Hydrogels can be functionalized with bioactive molecules such as growth factors (e.g., VEGF, TGF-β) and peptides (e.g., RGD peptides) to regulate cellular behavior. These molecules play a pivotal role in promoting angiogenesis, cell migration, and tissue regeneration within the engineered cardiac construct [96]. Moreover, cardiac tissue requires an electrically conductive microenvironment to support synchronized contraction. Hydrogels with inherent or engineered electrical conductivity facilitate the transmission of electrical signals, promoting the maturation and functionality of cardiac cells [53]. Incorporating conductive polymers, carbon-based materials, and metal nanoparticles into hydrogels enhances their electrical properties, creating a more biomimetic environment for cardiac tissue development [96,380,443]. In addition, the mechanical properties of hydrogels need to be close to those of native cardiac tissue to provide adequate structural support. Tunable stiffness is crucial for guiding cell differentiation and tissue maturation [444]. By adjusting the composition and crosslinking density, hydrogels can be engineered to achieve mechanical properties that closely resemble the native myocardium, ensuring optimal support for cardiac cells [63,445]. Additionally, hydrogels should have controllable degradation kinetics to align with the tissue regeneration process. Degradation that occurs too quickly or too slowly may hinder proper tissue development [446]. Enzymatically or hydrolytically degradable hydrogels can be tailored to match the desired degradation rate, enabling the gradual replacement of the scaffolds by newly formed tissues [446]. Moreover, effective transport of oxygen and nutrients is vital for the survival and functionality of cardiac cells in the hydrogel scaffold. Pore size and interconnectivity in the hydrogel structure must be carefully designed to facilitate efficient diffusion [447,448]. Incorporating bioactive components that promote angiogenesis further ensures an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients throughout the engineered cardiac tissue [320,449,450].",
        "In cardiac TE, cell delivery and integration into hydrogels could contribute to the regeneration of functionalities of cardiac tissues [445]. Hydrogels designed for cardiac applications can be carefully engineered to incorporate and facilitate the precise delivery of various cell types, such as cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, cardiac fibroblasts and stem cells, each playing a specific role in restoring cardiac tissues [451]. Anisotropy in hydrogels is also important for cardiac TE because such hydrogels have the ability to mimic the directional properties found in native cardiac tissues. This feature promotes alignment and orientation of cardiomyocytes along specific axes, which is essential for proper electrical conduction and mechanical function of the heart [452,453]. Wu et al. [43] fabricated a 3D hybrid scaffold with aligned conductive nanofiber yarns network (NFYs-NET, composed of polycaprolactone, silk fibroin, and carbon nanotubes) in a hydrogel shell, demonstrating potential for 3D cardiac anisotropy engineering. Using dry-wet electrospinning, they developed an interwoven structure reminiscent of native cardiac tissue. The scaffold, depicted in Fig. 22A, featured a network design advantageous for cardiac tissue regeneration. Fluorescence images of NFYs-NET scaffolds, prepared using nanofiber yarns with varying diameters, are shown in Fig. 22B. These scaffolds facilitated aligned and elongated cardiomyocyte maturation on each layer, with the ability to individually control cellular orientation in a 3D environment (Fig. 22C) [43]. Additionally, co-culturing cardiomyocytes on electroconductive layered hydrogels and endothelial cells within the hydrogel shell induced cellular orientation, maturation, and anisotropy, providing a suitable 3D environment for endothelialization and significant potential in engineering 3D cardiac anisotropy (Fig. 22D) [43]. Furthermore, endothelial cells play a significant role in vascularization by aiding in the formation of blood vessels within hydrogels. This vascular network is crucial for ensuring adequate oxygen and nutrient supply to engineered tissue, thereby promoting its overall health and functionality [454,455]. Stem cells, known for their regenerative abilities, can further enhance the hydrogel capacity to support tissue repair and regeneration. Under controlled conditions, stem cells can undergo specific differentiation protocols, facilitating the development of specialized cell lineages relevant to tissues affected by specific conditions [456].Fig. 22(A) The interwoven structure observed in native cardiac tissue highlights the potential benefits of a scaffold with a network structure for cardiac tissue regeneration.

        "The conductivity of myocardium is important for cardiac function, facilitating the transmission of electrical signals for synchronized heart contractions [96,115]. Conductive polymers like PPy are widely used in scaffolds for their high conductivity and electrical stability [221,241,387]. However, achieving highly conductive and biocompatible fibers with high concentrations of conductive polymers remains challenging, as they can become cytotoxic to cardiac cells, leading to cell death and tissue malfunction. This effect can be attenuated by blending conductive polymers with functional biocompatible biomaterials [96,457,458]. To address this issue, the researchers recently combined conductive polymers with biocompatible biomaterials such as GelMA, to develop GelMA-PPy nanoparticles [458]. GelMA served as both a shape inducer and a toxicity-neutralizer during the formation of the nanoparticles through oxidative polymerization. The study demonstrated that GelMA-PPy nanoparticles highlighted suitable biocompatibility even at high concentrations (50 mg/mL) [458]. Live/dead staining of cardiomyocytes and myocardial fibroblasts showed that cell viability remained stable from day 1 to day 7 for cardiomyocytes treated with GelMA-PPy nanoparticles (Fig. 22E–F). In contrast, significant cell death was observed in the control group treated with pure PPy. Quantitative analysis revealed that over 80 % of cardiomyocytes survived with GelMA-PPy nanoparticles, similar to the CMs on glass slides, while only 60 % survived with pure PPy (Fig. 22E–F). This approach shows a interesting solution to balancing conductivity and cell viability making them suitable for cardiac TE [458].",
        "Another important aspect to integrate when designing hydrogels for cardiovascular tissue regeneration is vascularization [455]. Establishing effective vascularization is crucial for ensuring the survival and optimal functionality of engineered tissue. This aspect is addressed in recent research studies through the incorporation of specific features in hydrogels designed to promote the formation of blood vessels [163,228,459]. To enhance vascularization in engineered cardiac tissue constructs, numerous studies have shown successful outcomes by incorporating angiogenic factors [317], or integrating endothelial cells [173,320,454] into functional hydrogels. These strategies are pivotal in promoting the development and maturation of a functional vascular network within the hydrogel matrix. The incorporation of growth factors within hydrogels represents a cornerstone in promoting cardiovascular tissue regeneration. Growth factors such as VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have demonstrated the ability to stimulate angiogenesis, a fundamental process for establishing a functional vascular network in regenerating tissues [460,461]. Controlled incorporation of these growth factors into hydrogel matrices containing specific cells capable of promoting vascularization ensures a temporally and spatially coordinated response, facilitating the formation of new blood vessels and enhancing nutrient delivery to the regenerating tissue. These bioactive molecules can stimulate the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, thereby fostering the creation of a well-organized and interconnected vascular network [462]. Furthermore, directly incorporating endothelial cells into the hydrogel also provides a biological component essential for vascular development, as these cells play a central role in forming the inner lining of blood vessels, contributing to their structural integrity and functionality [463]. Mehrabi et al. [464] recently used electrospinning technology to fabricate electroactive cardiac patches composed of carbon nanofibers (CNF) and gelatin (Gel) nanofibers. SEM assessment of developed fibrous scaffolds revealed randomly oriented nanofibers and electrical conductivity was in the semiconducting range (∼10−5 S/m) as determined by a four-probe device. MTT assays highlighted suitable biocompatibility and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cytotoxicity studies demonstrated robust cell attachment on scaffolds (Fig. 23A) [464]. Notably, electroactive scaffolds (CNF/Gel) exhibited complete cell coverage, creating a favorable functional HUVECs-based platform. CNF-containing scaffolds facilitated cardiomyocyte adhesion and elevated cardiac gene expression compared to non-conductive counterparts. Angiogenic assessment after subcutaneous implantation in mices for 2 and 4 weeks indicated enhanced vascularization in CNF/Gel scaffolds, which almost fully integrated with host tissue (Fig. 23B). CNF/Gel scaffolds further demonstrated significant cell migration, reaching about 85 % after 4 weeks (Fig. 23C). Immunofluorescence staining revealed increased capillary formation in CNF-containing scaffolds, confirming their angiogenic potential for cardiac TE [464]. He et al. [458] developed a mussel-inspired conductive electrospun (ES)-based engineered cardiac patch (ECP) to address challenges in the biocompatibility and aggregation of polypyrrole (PPy) in cardiac TE (Fig. 23D). Spherical methyl acrylic anhydride-gelatin (GelMA)-PPy nanoparticles were synthesized via oxidative polymerization and crosslinked onto an ES-GelMA/polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibrous membrane using a dopamine-N'N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide (dopa-MBA) crosslinker. This strategy yielded a conductive and biocompatible scaffold [458]. GelMA-PPy nanoparticles exhibited suitable biocompatibility and improved cardiomyocyte (CM) synchronization and function in vitro. The modified topography of the membrane enhanced vascularization, with Ki67-positive HUVEC proliferation increasing fourfold and tube formation density tripling compared to pristine membranes. Angiogenic gene expression (eNOS, VEGF, KDR) was significantly elevated on the conductive membrane (Fig. 23E). In vivo, transplantation of the ECP decreased infarct size by 50 %, improved left ventricular shortening fraction by 20 %, and increased neovascular density in infarcted regions by ninefold compared to myocardial infarction controls (Fig. 23F). The study highlights a promising ECP design that leverages mussel-inspired conductive membranes to enhance cardiac function and revascularization, addressing myocardial infarction repair challenges [458]. Meng et al. [465] designed a composite scaffold by combining carbon fibers with coaxial fibrous mesh of poly(lactide)/gelatin (PLA@Gel), leveraging the high modulus and electrical conductivity of carbon fibers alongside the fibrous and porous properties of electrospun fibers. The scaffold was constructed through a straightforward process of integrating coaxial electrospun PLA@Gel fibers and carbon fibers via freeze-drying process [465]. In this study, the fibrous composite prepared from poly(lactide)/gelatin and carbon fibers (CF) were named PLA@Gel/CF. SEM analysis revealed homogeneous fibers with an average diameter of 760 nm and CFs were evenly distributed in the porous scaffolds (Fig. 23G). Immunohistological staining of Cx43 and α-SMA was performed on heart tissue (Fig. 23H(i)). In the myocardial infarcted group, no Cx43-positive cells were found in the infarcted area, indicating complete replacement of muscle tissue by scar tissue [465]. The PLA@Gel group showed a slight increase in Cx43 expression, while the PLA@Gel/CF3 group exhibited a significant rise in Cx43, suggesting effective tissue regeneration. α-SMA staining revealed more blood vessels in the PLA@Gel/CF3 group, with larger-diameter vessels compared to the PLA@Gel group, indicating enhanced angiogenesis. Vessel density, assessed by counting α-SMA-positive structures, was significantly higher in the PLA@Gel/CF3 group, approximately three times that of the myocardial infarcted group and significantly higher than in the PLA@Gel group (Fig. 23H(ii)), highlighting the positive impact of PLA@Gel/CF3 on myocardial regeneration [465].Fig. 23(A) SEM analysis of nanofiber morphology for i) Gel and ii) CNF/Gel.

        "Hydrogels engineered for cardiac tissue regeneration are essential for providing suitable mechanical support to damaged or weakened heart tissue, thereby preventing further deterioration and actively supporting natural healing processes within the cardiac environment [466]. This mechanical support is commonly tailored to meet the specific needs of the myocardium, ensuring optimal functionality and integration. The mechanical properties of cardiac patches, such as elasticity and stiffness, are precisely engineered to closely mimic those of native myocardium [467]. This precise tuning is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it prevents mechanical mismatch, enabling seamless integration of the hydrogel with surrounding tissue and without causing undue stress or strain. The objective is to establish a harmonious interface that facilitates proper functioning of the engineered tissue [395]. Secondly, aligning the mechanical properties with those of native myocardium enables the cardiac hydrogel to promote physiological responses in the regenerated tissue. This includes synchronized contractions and relaxations, facilitating more natural and coordinated heart function [73,184]. The tuned mechanical characteristics could also contribute to the overall structural integrity of the hydrogel construct, enhancing its ability to withstand the dynamic mechanical forces exerted during the cardiac cycle [184]. Integrating electroconductive components into hydrogels for cardiac TE can further enhance their mechanical properties through synergistic mechanisms [457]. These electroconductive components significantly reinforce the hydrogel matrix, improving mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and structural integrity. Acting as reinforcing agents, they form a robust network within the hydrogel structure [395]. This reinforcement enhances tensile strength, elastic modulus, and toughness, rendering the hydrogel more resilient to mechanical stresses and better mimicking the mechanical properties of native cardiac tissue [56,96]. In a recent study, various electrospun fiber mats were evaluated for their mechanical properties. The study included combinations of electrically conductive PANi, collagen, and hyaluronic acid (HA) to fabricate electrospun and electroconductive scaffolds [60]. Neat collagen fiber mats exhibited an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 10 ± 2 MPa, a failure strain (FS) of 3.2 ± 0.4 %, and Young's modulus of 4 ± 1 MPa. Introduction of HA in collagen matrix increased UTS to 14 ± 4 MPa, while fiber mats with lower PANi content showed similar results. PANi concentrations up to PANi3 initially increased FS and UTS, but further increases (PANi4) led to a decline [60]. The lower collagen concentration in PANi4 contributed to reduced mechanical properties. Despite having a higher Young's modulus than native myocardium, the fiber mats demonstrated favorable environment for cardiomyocyte growth and function. In comparison to other materials used in cardiac TE, these fiber mats exhibited elastic modulus and tensile strength closer to native myocardium (Fig. 24A) [60].Fig. 24(A) Mechanical properties of collagen, collagen/HA, and collagen/HA/PANi blends illustrated through representative stress–strain graphs.

        "Remodeling and maturation are also main aspects to consider when designing functional hydrogels for cardiac TE. Beyond their anti-inflammatory properties, these hydrogels should be engineered to facilitate the gradual transformation of the artificial construct into functional native tissue over time [468]. This dynamic process involves the stepwise replacement of hydrogel materials with host-derived tissue components as the engineered construct integrates and matures within the surrounding biological environment [27]. The process of remodeling and maturation begins with the introduction of the hydrogel into the damaged or weakened cardiac tissue. As the hydrogel integrates, it serves as a temporary scaffold, providing mechanical support to the damaged tissue and creating a conducive environment for cellular activities [73]. Importantly, the hydrogel is designed to mimic the ECM of the native myocardium, offering cues for proper cell adhesion, migration, and tissue organization [469]. Over time, as the host cells infiltrate the hydrogel scaffold, they actively participate in tissue remodeling. This involves the synthesis and deposition of endogenous ECM components, such as collagen and elastin. Simultaneously, the hydrogel should begin to undergo controlled degradation, allowing for the gradual replacement of synthetic materials by the host tissue [335]. The process of maturation is characterized by the development of functional tissue properties resembling those of the native myocardium. Cardiomyocytes cultured in the hydrogel should align themselves in a more organized manner, and the mechanical properties of the developing tissue should approach those of the natural cardiac muscle [470]. This transition from hydrogel to native tissue is crucial for the fabrication of a seamlessly integrated and fully functional hydrogel for cardiac tissue repair. The engineered hydrogel is evidenced by its capacity to direct and facilitate the remodeling and maturation processes [470]. The incorporation of electroconductive polymers into hydrogels could play a crucial role in influencing the maturation of cardiomyocytes for cardiac TE. The interaction between the electroconductive polymers and cardiomyocytes could promote alignment and elongation of the cells, resembling the natural organization of cardiac tissues. Additionally, the conductive properties of these polymers contribute to improved contractile function, alignment of sarcomeres, and expression of cardiac-specific genes, leading to the maturation of cardiomyocytes. The conductive cues provided by electroconductive polymers in hydrogels create a supportive niche for cardiomyocyte development, ultimately enhancing the functionality and maturity of engineered cardiac tissues in vitro and in vivo. Sun et al. [471] demonstrated enhanced adhesion, intercalated disc-related protein expression, assembly, and functionality in neonatal cardiomyocytes (CMs) in single-walled-incorporated collagen hydrogels (Fig. 24B(i−iii)). Examining the organization, proliferation and phenotypes of cardiac cells on various hybrid scaffolds, the study focused on immunostaining of focal adhesion marker vinculin on day 3 and cardiac markers sarcomeric α-actin, CX43, and troponin I on day 5 (Fig. 24B(iv)) [471]. The results revealed that engineered cardiac tissues matured on CNT- and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-GelMA had higher expression levels of these markers compared to graphene oxide (GO)-GelMA [471]. In particular, immunofluorescence staining revealed that engineered cardiac tissues cultured on CNT-GelMA and rGO-GelMA showed enhanced maturation compared to those on GO-GelMA. Vinculin expression was ∼1.5-fold higher on CNT-GelMA and ∼1.6-fold higher on rGO-GelMA. Sarcomeric α-actin lengths were ∼1.8-fold and ∼1.4-fold longer for CNT-GelMA and rGO-GelMA, respectively. Additionally, Cx43 expression was ∼2.3-fold higher on CNT-GelMA and ∼3.0-fold higher on rGO-GelMA (Fig. 24B(v-viii)). Electroconductive hybrid scaffolds acting as electrical connections between cardiomyocytes were found to promote increased expression of cardiac markers. Specifically, CNT-GelMA was observed to enhance troponin I expression, indicating a targeted improvement in the development and maturation of engineered cardiac tissues (Fig. 24B) [471].",
        "Moreover, biodegradability is a fundamental attribute to be considered in the design of functional hydrogels for cardiac TE [446]. In essence, these hydrogels should be engineered to undergo a controlled and gradual degradation process over time, aligning with the pace of native tissue regeneration. This degradation serves a dual purpose: providing essential structural support during the early phases of tissue healing and subsequently allowing the hydrogel to dissipate as the native tissue undergoes regeneration [472]. The gradual degradation of the hydrogel should be carefully timed to coincide with the natural tissue repair process, ensuring that the engineered support is available when required. Upon the degradation, the hydrogel breaks down into biocompatible byproducts, which are either absorbed into surrounding tissue or safely removed from the body [473]. This process mitigates the risk of long-term foreign body reactions and promotes the integration of the newly regenerated tissue in the host environment [474]. In vitro biodegradation of these hydrogels is investigated under simulated physiological conditions to comprehensively assess their stability and breakdown mechanisms. Factors including pH levels, temperature variations, and enzymatic activity are crucial determinants influencing the degradation kinetics of these materials [474]. Enzymes that are either present in the culture medium or specifically designed to simulate biological conditions can catalyze the degradation of hydrogel components. [159,439]. For example, a 3D functional cardiac tissue construct was printed using a gold nanorod (GNR)-incorporated gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-based bioink. GelMA-coated GNRs (G-GNRs) diffusion was monitored in phenol red-free medium, with spectrophotometric measurements of the medium collected from day 1 to day 5 [439]. On day 5, constructs were dissolved in collagenase type II at 37 °C to quantify G-GNR release via spectrophotometer. The persistent red color of G-GNRs was visually observed in 3D printed constructs throughout a 5-day culture, with a noticeable red hue emerging upon collagenase-induced degradation. (Fig. 24C(i)). Absorbance spectrum analysis verified G-GNR retention and release solely upon forced degradation (Fig. 24C(ii)) [439]. In vivo biodegradation of electroconductive hydrogels involves their interaction within the intricate physiological environment of living tissues. Upon transplantation, biopolymer-based hydrogels respond naturally to enzymatic reactions, cellular interactions, and immune responses, leading to gradual material breakdown. These biological processes play a crucial role in determining the longevity and compatibility of hydrogels in vivo, influencing their functional integration and potential applications in TE and biomedical research [475,476]. Macrophages, for instance, may play a crucial role in the recognition and engulfment of the hydrogels, initiating a cascade of events leading to their degradation [477]. Additionally, the incorporation of biodegradable components in hydrogel formulations facilitates their gradual breakdown into biocompatible byproducts, reducing the risk of adverse reactions [474].",
        "The use of electrically conductive materials in combination with biopolymer-based polymers, to develop electroconductive hydrogel scaffolds for cardiac TE presents significant challenges regarding their biodegradation and potential toxicity in living organisms. Traditional conductive materials, such as PPy, graphene, CNTs and PANi, often exhibit non-biodegradable or very slow biodegradation rates in vivo, which can lead to the accumulation of material residues within tissues, triggering chronic inflammatory responses, fibrosis, and potential toxic effects [[478], [479], [480]]. This slow degradation also hinders the efficient integration of the scaffold with native tissue, disrupting the natural regenerative process. Moreover, some conductive materials may leach toxic by-products during degradation, further exacerbating cellular damage and impairing tissue functionality [479,480]. To overcome these challenges, bio-ionic liquids (Bio-ILs) have emerged as a promising alternative. Particularly those derived from choline, Bio-ILs provide an interesting combination of biocompatibility, biodegradability, intrinsic electroconductivity, and non-cytotoxicity [481]. When incorporated into biopolymer-based polymers like GelMA, Bio-ILs can provide electroconductive properties while ensuring that the hydrogels degrade at a controlled, physiologically relevant rate. This strategy enables not only the safe and efficient degradation of the scaffolds but also minimizes the risk of toxicity, supporting the regeneration of cardiac tissue without compromising scaffold performance over time [482]. In addition, GelMA-based hydrogels are known to contain peptide sequences that facilitate cell-mediated degradation in vivo [[483], [484], [485]]. Noshadi et al. [482] synthesized the Bio-IL-functionalized GelMA hydrogels, and their conductivity was measured using a two-probe electrical station. The results showed that varying the GelMA concentrations and the Bio-IL ratios influenced the electrical properties of the resulting GelMA/Bio-IL hydrogels. For instance, the conductivity of 50/50 GelMA/Bio-IL hydrogels increased from 3.03 × 10−5 S/m to 5.03 × 10−5 S/m when the polymer concentration was raised from 10 % to 20 %. Moreover, when the GelMA/Bio-IL ratio was adjusted from 50/50 to 20/80, the conductivity of 15 % GelMA/Bio-IL hydrogels increased by more than 63 times, from 4.27 × 10−5 S/m to 272 × 10−5 S/m, demonstrating the effective tuning of electroconductive properties [482]. Furthermore, the engineered hydrogels facilitated the growth and function of primary cardiomyocytes in both 2D and 3D in vitro cultures. The study also investigated the in vivo biodegradation and biocompatibility of GelMA/Bio-IL hydrogels, addressing a major limitation of conventional conductive polymers, which are often not biodegradable and can induce chronic inflammation due to their long half-lives in the body. When implanted subcutaneously in an animal model, GelMA/Bio-IL hydrogels were observed to undergo sustained biodegradation over a 28-day period, as shown by the recovery of explanted samples at different periods till 28 days (Fig. 24D(i)). The degradation of the hydrogel matrix occurred through enzymatic hydrolysis, with notable tissue infiltration observed within the hydrogels, as evidenced by the visual inspection of explanted samples shown in Fig. 24D(ii) [482]. Histological analysis of the explanted hydrogels showed that cellular ingrowth occurred with minimal inflammation, accompanied by low deposition of fibrous collagenous tissue (Fig. 24D(iii-v)). Immunohistofluorescent staining for CD3 confirmed the absence of sustained infiltration of pro-inflammatory leukocytes (Fig. 24D(vi-viii)). Additionally, a macrophage response, marked by CD68 expression, was observed at day 4 but decreased significantly by day 28 (Fig. 24D(ix-xi)), indicating minimal inflammatory reactions. These findings suggested that GelMA/Bio-IL hydrogels induced minimal inflammatory responses in vivo, and their biocompatibility and biodegradability could be further tailored depending on the specific biopolymers used [482]. Ideally, biodegradable cardiac TE biomaterials fully consisting of polymer and cells could be proposed. In those polymer-based biomaterials, produced for example by combining cardiac cell-laden 3D bioprinting and electrospinning, the achieved microstructure should match the needed for cell-cell interaction and electrical coupling of cardiac cells, to have gaing of the intrinsic electrical properties of cells in the 3D mimicking environment allowing for synchronous beating, possibly without the need of addition of non biodegradable conductive materials.",
        "Electroconductive hydrogels hold great promise in advancing cardiac TE due to the combination of electrical conductivity and anti-inflammatory properties, both of which are crucial for enhancing tissue regeneration and minimizing immune responses [96]. These hydrogels are designed by integrating electrically conductive materials into a hydrophilic polymer matrix, enabling them to conduct electrical signals that support cellular communication, particularly in cardiac tissues that depend on synchronized electrical signaling for normal function [96,379,457]. Beyond their conductive capabilities, these hydrogels also modulate macrophage polarization, a crucial factor in managing inflammation. In cardiac TE, inflammation is a complex biological response triggered by injury or the implantation of foreign materials, leading to the recruitment of immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, which release pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors that alter the tissue microenvironment. This inflammatory process can result in fibrosis, impaired tissue regeneration, and poor graft integration, ultimately compromising the functionality of engineered constructs [477,486,487]. Electroconductive hydrogels mitigate these issues by promoting the polarization of macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, reducing chronic inflammation and accelerating healing, mainly through electrical stimulation or their inherent electrochemical properties [488,489]. This polarization activates key intracellular pathways, such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which regulate inflammatory responses by controlling the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. In M1 macrophages, NF-κB activation promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, whereas its inhibition in M2 macrophages aids in resolving inflammation and enhancing tissue repair [477,486,489]. Moreover, these conductive hydrogels can also regulate ion flux, modulating immune cell behavior by influencing membrane potential and ion channel activation, which helps control cytokine production and reduce inflammation in damaged tissues [191,490].",
        "Immunomodulation is an important aspect of cardiovascular engineering, where efforts are made to finely tune the immune response for optimal tissue integration. In this context, the hydrogels are designed to act as immunomodulatory agents, aiming to mitigate the risk of rejection while fostering a conducive environment for seamless tissue integration [490,491]. Through strategic engineering, these hydrogels should be tailored to interact with the immune system in a way that minimizes adverse reactions. The goal is to create a microenvironment that promotes immunological tolerance, preventing an excessive inflammatory response that could compromise the viability and functionality of the implanted hydrogel [492,493]. Hydrogels with immunomodulatory properties frequently integrate biomaterials such as hyaluronic acid, collagen, silk fibroin, chitosan, among others. These biomaterials either possess intrinsic immunomodulatory capabilities or can be modified to actively modulate immune cell behavior [490,491,494]. Furthermore, the hydrogels may be designed to promote the recruitment of regulatory immune cells, such as T regulatory cells, which play an important role in suppressing immune reactions and facilitating a more tolerogenic environment. This strategic modulation of immune cell dynamics is aimed at minimizing the risk of rejection and creating a permissive setting for the hydrogel to integrate seamlessly with the host tissue [495]. Furthermore, in cardiac TE, incorporating specific molecules and drugs into hydrogels shows significant promise for augmenting their immunomodulatory capabilities. Alongside biomaterials known for their enhanced immunomodulatory properties in hydrogel design for cardiac tissue regeneration, research has also investigated the inclusion of anti-inflammatory agents like cytokines or growth factors [494,496]. For instance, interleukin-10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine, has been explored for its potential to suppress immune responses [497,498]. Moreover, the controlled release of immunomodulatory drugs, including tacrolimus and cyclosporine, traditionally used as immunosuppressants can be tailored to regulate the immune microenvironment surrounding cardiac tissues [499,500].",
        "Electroconductive hydrogels have demonstrated significant potential in modulating immune responses in cardiac TE, a specific aspect for fostering tissue repair and mitigating inflammatory complications [224,379,488]. This immunomodulation is intricately influenced by specific cardiac cell types, including cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages, each contributing uniquely to inflammation regulation and healing [224,488]. Cardiomyocytes benefit from the conductive environment of electroconductive hydrogels, which supports their survival, reduces oxidative stress, and limits pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion [224,379,488]. Cardiac fibroblasts, essential for ECM remodeling, adopt a reparative phenotype in electroconductive hydrogels, minimizing pathological fibrosis and maintaining tissue integrity [91,460]. Endothelial cells are stimulated by electroconductive hydrogels to enhance angiogenesis, improving oxygenation and nutrient delivery while indirectly controlling immune cell behavior [31,379]. Macrophages play a central role in the immune response of the heart, acting as key regulators of inflammation and tissue repair. These cells exhibit significant plasticity, meaning they can shift between two primary functional states: the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype [86,477]. The M1 phenotype is typically associated with the release of cytokines and other mediators that exacerbate inflammation and contribute to tissue damage [489,501]. In contrast, the M2 phenotype is linked to tissue repair and resolution of inflammation, characterized by the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors that promote cell proliferation and wound healing [489,501]. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of electrospun electroconductive hydrogels in influencing macrophage polarization, due to their interesting material properties including surface chemistry, electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. These hydrogels can mimic the natural ECM, providing a microenvironment that encourages macrophages to adopt an M2 phenotype, thereby mitigating the harmful effects of excessive inflammation [224,488]. This polarization shift is particularly beneficial in the context of cardiac tissue repair, as M2 macrophages can release key growth factors such as VEGF and TGF-β, which facilitate angiogenesis and collagen remodeling, suitable processes in healing after myocardial injury. By modifying macrophage behavior through these material interactions, electroconductive hydrogels not only reduce local inflammation but also promote regenerative healing, thereby directly influencing the inflammatory microenvironment within the heart [224,488]. Wei et al. [224] developed a novel cardiac patch for cardiac remodeling post-myocardial infarction (MI) by combining brown adipose-derived stem cell (BADSC) sheets with electrospun polycaprolactone/silk fibroin nanofibers containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The electrically conductive electrospun hydrogels achieved were named CPSN. The study demonstrated that BADSCs on CPSN formed myocardium-like structures, promoting gap junction remodeling and restoring cardiac function. In a rat MI model, the CNBS patch significantly modulated the immune environment, decreasing the infiltration of CD45-positive leukocytes at the infarction site compared to the no-treatment control group (Fig. 25A(i,ii)) [224]. Additionally, CD68 protein expression, a marker of macrophages, was significantly reduced in the CNBS group (Fig. 25A(iii,iv)), suggesting decreased macrophage presence. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed that the CNBS patch decreased pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage marker IL-1β while increasing the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage marker CD163 (Fig. 25A(v,vi)). The CNBS group also exhibited a higher CD163/IL-1β ratio compared to the CPSN-sus and no-treatment groups. Moreover, CNBS treatment led to decreased IL-1β and TNF-α mRNA expressions and increased IL-10 mRNA expression (Fig. 25A(vii)). ELISA assays confirmed that CNBS treatment significantly reduced inflammatory factors (IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-10) in rat serum (Fig. 25A(viii)), promoting an immunoreparative environment for tissue regeneration [224]. Gil-Castell et al. [488] designed electrospun nanofiber scaffolds based on polycaprolactone (PCL), gelatin (Ge), and PANi particles for cardiac TE applications. The researchers fabricated scaffolds with varying PCL/Ge ratios (60/40, 50/50, and 40/60) and PANi contents (0.25 wt%, 0.50 wt%, and 1.00 wt%). Fig. 25B shows SEM images of the electrospun composite scaffolds obtained. The study demonstrated that increasing gelatin content and dissolution time (DT) enhanced scaffold biocompatibility and degradation. The incorporation of PANi in electrospun fibrous scaffolds promoted a controlled increase in electrical conductivity of resulting composites, which stimulated cardiomyocyte proliferation without impairing cellular growth [488]. To confirm cell attachment to the scaffolds, cells were seeded, fixed after 48 and 96 h, and stained with DAPI. The images, shown in Fig. 25C, revealed cell presence on all scaffolds. Cell proliferation in the scaffolds increased with higher Ge content due to its higher biocompatibility. In the 60/40 PCL/Ge composition, few cells were observed, while in the 40/60 nanofibers, cell numbers increased and occupied more surface after 96 h. Scaffolds electrospun after 24 and 48 h showed similar results [488]. Moreover, the effect of combined PCL, Ge, and PANi on the macrophage profile was evaluated using PCL/Ge/PANi scaffolds with different compositions. The expression profiles of TNFα (M1 marker) and CD206 (M2 marker) were analyzed through qPCR, and the results are shown in Fig. 25D [488]. None of the scaffolds impaired macrophage polarization. Significant differences were observed between the control and cells seeded onto the scaffolds when assessing the change in TNFα marker. Macrophages seeded on scaffolds containing PANi (1.00 %wt) exhibited less expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα than control cells. Moreover, all the compositions analyzed exhibited similar behavior, indicating that variations in the percentages of PCL and Ge had a negligible impact on the overall response. A similar trend was observed when assessing CD206, a specific marker of the M2 profile, where no relevant differences were found between control cells and cells seeded onto the scaffolds [488]. This study demonstrated that the incorporation of PANi at 1 %wt in PCL/Ge scaffolds modulated the inflammatory response of macrophages by downregulating the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα, typically associated with the M1 phenotype. However, this reduction does not conclusively indicate a shift in macrophage polarization, as polarization involves a complex interaction of multiple markers. Specifically, no significant differences in CD206 expression, a marker of the M2 phenotype, were observed between control cells and those seeded onto PANi-containing scaffolds. These findings suggest that while PANi may reduce M1-associated proinflammatory activity, it does not induce a complete shift toward the M2 phenotype. Therefore, PANi-containing scaffolds likely promote a moderated inflammatory response by attenuating M1 activity without significantly altering overall macrophage polarization [488].Fig. 25(A) Immune modulation by CNBS patches in vivo post-MI.

        "Cells seeded in electrically conductive hydrogels undergo adhesion and spreading, where the interactions between the cells and the material significantly influence the early stages of tissue development. Electroconductive hydrogels offer specific biochemical and biophysical cues that enable cells to interact with the material chemical functions to support tissue development [472,502]. Initially, electroconductive hydrogels should present a biocompatible environment that could mimic properties and features of the native ECM. This similarity allows integrin receptors on the cell membrane to recognize and bind to specific ligands or functional groups on the hydrogel surface. This initial adhesion triggers signaling pathways within the cell, leading to the formation of focal adhesions and cytoskeletal rearrangements. These processes stabilize the cell on the hydrogel surface and facilitate spreading [384,503].",
        "Once cells have successfully adhered, the next step in this coordinated process involves cell spreading. Cell spreading involves the extension of adhered cells across the surface of the hydrogel, a process that is significantly influenced by the functional and conductive properties of the hydrogel [504]. The electrical and biochemical cues provided by the electroconductive hydrogel can actively guide cytoskeletal organization, shaping cellular morphology and influencing the spatial arrangement of cells [505]. This dynamic interaction is particularly significant in cardiac TE, where the orchestrated spreading of cardiac cells holds paramount importance for the synchronized contraction necessary for optimal heart function [53,96]. Furthermore, the promotion of cell spreading within electroconductive hydrogels is crucial for tissue development. Cell spreading is a dynamic process where cells extend filopodia and lamellipodia, which are thin, finger-like projections and broad, sheet-like extensions, respectively [506,507]. These structures allow cells to explore and adhere to the surface of the hydrogel substrate, thereby increasing the contact area between the cell membrane and the material. This spreading process is influenced by various factors, including the topography, surface chemistry and electrical conductivity of the hydrogel. Enhanced cell spreading facilitates stronger interactions between cells and the hydrogel, promoting cellular adhesion, proliferation, and ultimately the formation of functional tissues constructs [507,508].",
        "Ensuring effective cell proliferation and viability in electroconductive biopolymer-based hydrogels is crucial for advancing cardiac TE. These hydrogels act as dynamic matrices that regulate cellular processes by providing tailored electrical, chemical, and mechanical cues, enabling seeded cells within the hydrogels to interact and perform their normal functions, facilitating the formation of functional tissue structures [159,160,248,326]. Electrical conductivity in the hydrogel enables the transmission of signals crucial for maintaining cell function and communication [433,509]. The incorporation of conductive polymers or nanoparticles endows these hydrogels with electrical conductivity. These electrical cues are not merely passive characteristics but actively guide cellular processes, fostering synchronized contractions in cardiomyocytes [510]. Furthermore, chemical cues provided by specific chemical functionalities present in hydrogels can facilitate essential processes such as cell adhesion, spreading, and differentiation, crucial for tissue development. The chemical composition of biomaterials and electroconductive polymers in the hydrogel offers a repertoire of cues influencing cellular responses. Meanwhile, the mechanical properties of the hydrogel, including its stiffness and elasticity, should provide structural support and mechanical cues that guide cellular activities [40,41,160]. In cardiac TE, the mechanical properties of electroconductive biopolymer-based hydrogels are commonly tailored to exert precise influences on cellular behavior through mechanotransduction processes [444]. The mechanical cues in the hydrogel matrix can profoundly affect cell morphology. Cells exhibit distinct morphological features in response to the mechanical properties of their surrounding environment [511]. Hydrogels engineered to mimic the stiffness and elasticity of native cardiac tissues guide cells to adopt shapes and structures conducive to their physiological functions, such as elongation and alignment of cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the mechanical cues exert a regulatory influence on the proliferation rates of cells in the hydrogel. The stiffness and elasticity of the hydrogel matrix can either promote or inhibit cell division [445,512]. Mimicking the mechanical characteristics of the native cardiac tissue should provide cues that synchronize with the cell cycle, thereby modulating the rate at which cells proliferate in the engineered constructs. The mechanical cues extend their influence to the broader aspect of tissue development in the hydrogel. They guide processes such as tissue maturation, alignment of cells, and the formation of functional tissue structures [191,513].",
        "The ability of electroconductive hydrogels to actively guide cellular differentiation is an important aspect, particularly in the context of stem cells [510]. Stem cell differentiation refers to the process by which undifferentiated or unspecialized cells undergo changes in gene expression and cellular characteristics to transform into specialized cells with specific functions [514]. Stem cells possess the unique capability to differentiate into diverse cell types, with differentiation serving as the primary mechanism that directs them toward a specific lineage or fate [515]. Electroconductive hydrogels, enriched with materials promoting the transmission of electrical signals within hydrogels introduce an advanced dimension to this differentiation phenomenon. The integration of electrical cues within the hydrogel matrix could exert a profound influence on the lineage commitment of stem cells [290,516]. Electrically conductive hydrogels transmit signals that act as instructive stimuli, influencing the fate of stem cells by modulating intracellular signaling pathways [290,425]. In addition, the unique electroconductive environment within the hydrogel actively facilitates the development of specific cell types relevant to the desired tissue regeneration [114]. Specific biochemical and physical signals incorporated into the hydrogel, such as growth factors, cytokines and mechanical stimuli, generally guide cell differentiation towards the cardiac lineage. The controlled release of these factors from the hydrogel matrix could influence gene expression and cellular behaviors, facilitating the maturation of cardiomyocytes with properties resembling those of native heart tissue [450,517,518].",
        "Moreover, the hydrogel biomaterial composition and electrical conductivity acts as a regulatory factor guiding cells toward desired phenotypic expressions. Electroconductive hydrogel not only acts as a physical scaffold for cellular adherence but also actively communicates with cells, influencing their gene expression patterns [510]. The interaction between electrical components and the intrinsic biochemical environment in the hydrogel creates a microenvironment that supports the expression of specific proteins, transcription factors and signaling molecules conducive to the desired cellular phenotypes [519]. Cardiac cell phenotypic expression refers to the observable characteristics and functional traits that these cells exhibit in response to various stimuli within their microenvironment [520]. In electroconductive hydrogels, the phenotypic expression of cardiac cells involves intricate molecular and cellular responses. The properties of the hydrogels create an environment that influences the cells to adopt specific traits. This includes changes in gene expression, protein synthesis, and cellular morphology, all of which contribute to the overall function of the cardiac cells [25,291]. Electroconductive hydrogels interact with cells through multiple signaling pathways, including ion channels, membrane receptors, and intracellular cascades. This interaction facilitates a controlled differentiation process, enabling the generation of various cell types within these hydrogels [111,521]. Cardiac cells cultured in electrically conductive hydrogels, frequently showcased heightened contractile capabilities, improved alignment, and an upswing in the expression of cardiac-specific markers, including troponins and connexins. Navaei et al. [522] used micro- and nano-technologies to fabricate gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels incorporating electrically conductive gold nanorods (GNRs) and microgrooves. In comparison to pure GelMA, GelMA–GNR hydrogels exhibited uniform, dense, and aligned cardiac tissues with enhanced connectivity and electrical properties, indicating potential functionality as cardiac patches in myocardial infarction scenarios (Fig. 26A) [522]. F-Actin stained images and fluorescent area coverage data depicted the formation of organized cardiac tissues on GelMA–GNR hydrogels, contrasting with disconnected cellular arrangements in pure GelMA constructs (Fig. 26B) [522]. Immunostaining images of cardiac markers, particularly sarcomeric α-actinin and connexin 43, revealed heightened cytoskeletal alignment and improved cellular connectivity on GelMA–GNR hydrogels (Fig. 26B). While tissues on both GelMA and GelMA–GNR constructs displayed spontaneous contractility from day 4–7 of culture, only electrically conductive GelMA–GNR cardiac tissues consistently responded to changes in beat rate upon external stimulation [522]. Roshanbinfar et al. [60] investigated the effects of incorporating PANi into electrospun collagen, and/or hyaluronic acid-based fiber mats on neonatal rat and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. At day 5, cardiomyocytes attached and spread on all fiber mats, displaying striated sarcomeres, with no significant differences in surface coverage (Fig. 26C). However, connexin 43 expression increased with higher PANi concentrations, particularly in PANi3 and PANi4 (Fig. 26C), indicating improved intercellular coupling. PANi4, which exhibited thinner, more aligned fibers, also showed higher conductivity, enhancing cellular beating properties [60]. Despite this, no significant increase in cellular alignment was observed, likely due to fiber mat swelling and the scale of alignment cues. In testing with hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, PANi4 scaffolds exhibited the highest contraction amplitude and connexin 43 expression, with rhythmic beating. Confocal analysis revealed differences in microstructure among collagen, collagen-HA, and PANi4 mats, and no significant differences in cell viability (Fig. 26D). The hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes developed organized striated structures on all scaffolds (Fig. 26D), supporting the potential of PANi-based scaffolds for cardiac 10.13039/100024656TE [60]. A recent study examined the impact of electrical conductivity on the phenotypic expression of cardiac cells cultured on engineered electrospun hydrogels containing PPy nanoparticles compared to non-conductive substrates [458]. Alpha-actinin, a cytoskeletal protein vital for maintaining sarcomere integrity in cardiomyocytes, and connexin-43, a key component of gap junctions essential for intercellular electrical communication in the heart, were used as markers to assess cellular health and function. After 3 days of culture, cardiomyocytes on non-conductive electrospun GelMA/PCL membranes displayed a round morphology and lacked intact sarcomeres (Fig. 26E). In contrast, CMs on conductive membranes containing Ppy nanoparticles formed typical sarcomeres [458]. By day 7, CMs on the conductive membranes exhibited more elongated, highly packed sarcomeres, with a significantly higher expression of α-sarcomeric protein. Additionally, Cx43 expression was significantly higher in CMs cultured on conductive membranes, particularly at the inter-sarcomere and inter-cellular membranes (Fig. 26E). The conductive membranes, with a highest concentration of GelMA-Ppy nanoparticles, resulted in a significant increase in the sarcomeric α-actinin-positive area, which reached 30 % and 55 % on days 3 and 7, respectively, compared to only 10 % and 30 % on non-conductive membranes (Fig. 26E). These findings highlighted the importance of electrical conductivity, facilitated by PPy nanoparticles, in enhancing the structural and functional integration of cardiac cells, suggesting its potential for improving cardiac TE applications [458].Fig. 26(A) Phase-contrast micrographs depicting cardiac cell cultures on GelMA and GelMA–GNR micro-grooved hydrogels at (i) day 1 and (ii) day 7.

        "Stem cell-based therapy holds significant potential for cardiac repair and regeneration, yet its clinical application is often hindered by challenges related to the limited efficiency of cardiac differentiation [523,524]. To address this, researchers have explored the incorporation of electrically conductive components like CNTs into hydrogel matrices as a means to design a more instructive extracellular microenvironment for stem cell cardiogenesis [523]. They aimed to investigate whether CNTs enhance the differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes and to elucidate the molecular signaling pathways that mediate this process. The electroconductive properties of CNTs, when embedded within hydrogel scaffolds, have been shown to influence stem cell behavior by promoting cell adhesion, growth, and alignment, thereby facilitating the differentiation of stem cells into functional cardiac cells [523]. They demonstrated that incorporating CNTs into collagen substrates (CNT-Col) provided an electroconductive ECM that significantly enhanced cardiogenesis in brown adipose-derived stem cells (BASCs) via the β1-integrin-dependent transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) signaling pathway. BASCs cultured on CNT-Col substrates exhibited enhanced cell adhesion, spreading, and growth. Notably, fluorescence staining and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that CNT-Col substrates markedly improved cardiac differentiation efficiency compared to collagen alone, with a higher percentage of α-sarcomeric actinin-positive (α-SA+) cells observed on CNT-Col substrates by day 3, 7, and 10 (Fig. 27A). BASCs on CNT-Col substrates adopted an elongated rod shape, displayed spontaneous contractile activity, and formed myofilaments indicative of mature cardiomyocytes. By day 10, these cells assembled into organized bundles with uniform contraction, aligning into sarcomere registers with superior structural maturity compared to those on collagen substrates (Fig. 27A) [523]. A detailed schematic model was proposed to elucidate the mechanism by which CNTs promote cardiac differentiation of brown adipose-derived stem cells (BASCs) via TGF-β1 signaling pathway (Fig. 27B). In this model, CNTs embedded in the ECM interact with β1-integrin, a transmembrane receptor, triggering its activation. This activation facilitates the release of active TGF-β1, a key growth factor involved in cellular differentiation and development. The released TGF-β1 binds to its receptor complexes on the BASC membrane, initiating downstream intracellular signaling (Fig. 27B) [523]. This cascade includes the phosphorylation and activation of Smad2 (p-Smad2), a central mediator in the TGF-β1 pathway. Activated p-Smad2 translocates to the nucleus, where it modulates the expression of cardiac-specific transcription factors. These transcription factors drive the differentiation of BASCs into cardiomyocytes by regulating genes responsible for sarcomeric organization, contractile protein expression, and functional maturation (Fig. 27B) [523].Fig. 27(A) CNTs accelerated cardiogenesis in brown adipose-derived stem cells (BASCs) and enhanced the maturation of BASC-derived cardiomyocytes (BASC-CMs).

        "Moreover, electroconductive CNT-based hydrogels were shown to enhance the assembly of intercalated discs (IDs) in cardiac myocytes through the β1-integrin-mediated signaling pathway, with results providing a mechanistic understanding of this enhancement [525]. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) cultured on CNT-Col substrates exhibited significant improvements in ID-related protein expression, including connexin43 (Cx43) for gap junctions, N-cadherin (NC) for adherens junctions, and plakophilin2 (PKP2) and plakoglobin (PG) for desmosomes. Immunofluorescence revealed that, by day 3, these proteins were more abundant and localized in intercellular regions in the CNT-Col group compared to controls (Fig. 27C) [525]. Western blotting confirmed significantly higher levels of these proteins in NRVMs on CNT-Col substrates relative to collagen-only (Col) substrates (Fig. 27C). By day 7, IDs in CNT-Col cultures showed progressive protein organization, with Cx43 forming linear plaques and NC, PKP2, and PG aligning in intercellular regions. This trend continued through day 14, with CNT-Col cultures displaying well-developed IDs, including larger and more numerous gap and mechanical junctions, compared to the control group (Fig. 27C). Functional assessment revealed that NRVMs on CNT-Col substrates formed a functional syncytium with stable rhythmic calcium transients by day 7, whereas controls displayed arrhythmic fluctuations (Fig. 27D) [525]. A schematic model was proposed to explain the mechanism by which CNTs accelerate the assembly of IDs in cardiac myocytes. The model highlights that CNTs interact with β1-integrin receptors at the cell membrane, initiating a cascade of intracellular signaling events important for ID formation (Fig. 27E). Upon activation, β1-integrin triggers the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway, which in turn activates downstream signaling molecules, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The ERK pathway plays a pivotal role in modulating transcriptional activity by stimulating cardiac-specific transcription factors such as GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA4) and myocyte enhancer factor-2c (MEF-2c) [525]. These transcription factors regulate the expression of genes coding for gap junction proteins, notably connexin43 (Cx43), a key component of electrical coupling in cardiac myocytes. Consequently, this signaling cascade facilitates the organization and assembly of mechanical junctions, such as adherens junctions and desmosomes, as well as gap junctions, which are essential for the structural and functional integrity of IDs [525]. The enhanced localization and maturation of ID-related proteins, including Cx43, N-cadherin, plakophilin2 (PKP2), and plakoglobin (PG), on CNT-collagen substrates corroborate this mechanism. These findings elucidate the role of β1-integrin-mediated signaling in orchestrating the molecular and structural processes underlying the accelerated assembly of IDs facilitated by CNTs, offering valuable insights into the nanomaterial-induced modulation of cardiac cell behavior [525].",
        "In the context of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes cultured in electroconductive hydrogels, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has been employed to analyze cardiomyocyte differentiation and maturation over time [90,526]. This has allowed for a comprehensive understanding of how electroconductive hydrogels influence the development and functionality of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, and has provided a platform for optimizing cardiac TE strategies. RNA-seq also enables the detection of genes involved in cellular processes like contractility, electrical signaling, and metabolic activity, which are essential for the functional maturation of cardiomyocytes [90,526,527]. The presence of electrically conductive materials in hydrogels promotes the maturation of hiPSC-cardiomyocytes. Several studies have demonstrated that incorporating PEDOT:PSS into hydrogels enhanced the expression of cardiac-related genes associated with cell maturation [90,526]. Gonzalez et al. [526] fabricated fibrillar electroconductive scaffolds by blending and electrospinning polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and PEDOT:PSS, followed by crosslinking for 15 or 30 min to prevent PVA dissolution. The SEM images of electrospun fibrous scaffolds are shown in Fig. 28A (i,ii). The addition of PEDOT:PSS in PVA matrix increased the initial fiber diameter compared to the diameter of PVA-scaffolds (Fig. 28A(iii,iv)). Scaffold stiffness, which influences stem cell behavior, scaled with PEDOT:PSS concentration (Fig. 28A(v)) and was consistent with normal cardiac muscle stiffness. The conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS/PVA scaffolds was measured using a transmission line model, revealing that the incorporation of PEDOT:PSS into PVA substantially increased the electrical conductivity of the resulting electroconductive fibrous scaffolds, reaching 7 × 10−3 S/cm2 for 8 % PVA electrospun scaffolds containing 9.75 % PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 28A(vi)) [526]. In that study, the fabricated electroconductive PEDOT:PSS/PVA scaffolds were found to upregulate cardiac-related genes, improve cytoskeletal structures, and aid calcium handling and membrane depolarization in human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Transcriptomic differences were examined through principal component analysis, which showed clustering based on substrate type, with increased dissimilarity between conductive and non-conductive scaffolds (Fig. 28B(i)). A total of 287 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between hPSC-CMs seeded on PVA-only and PEDOT:PSS/PVA-scaffolds (Fig. 28B(ii)) [526]. Gene ontology (GO) terms associated with PVA-only scaffolds highlighted stress responses, including immune and viral responses, while PEDOT:PSS/PVA scaffolds were linked to heart and muscle-related functions, including muscle contraction and decreased stress response (Fig. 28B(iii)). Further analysis revealed that gene expression related to hPSC-CM contractility (MYH6, MYH7, MYL7), sarcomere organization (TCAP), and electrophysiology (KCNIP2, ATP1A2, RNF207) was elevated on conductive scaffolds (Fig. 28B(iv)). Notably, MYH7, a marker of hPSC-CM maturity was upregulated, suggesting that the electroconductive environment promoted not only increased cardiomyocyte contractility but also enhanced cellular maturation. Additionally, while MYL2 expression was higher in hPSC-CMs on electroconductive scaffolds compared to neat PVA scaffolds [526].Fig. 28(A) Physical characterization of electrospun scaffolds. (i) SEM images of 8 % PVA electrospun scaffolds incubated in DPBS for 4 weeks post-crosslinking with glutaraldehyde vapor for 15 min (ii), 30 min (iii), and 30 min with 9.75 % PEDOT:PSS/PVA.

Median stiffness values for 8 % PVA, 11 % PVA, 3.25 %, 6.5 %, and 9.75 % were 9.30, 26.68, 18.36, 27.91, and 44.76 kPa, respectively (n = 4 scaffolds per condition; 1 point represents 1 force map).

        "Roshanbinfar et al. [90] demonstrated that incorporating PEDOT:PSS into collagen-based hydrogels promoted the maturation of hiPSC-cardiomyocytes cultured in these hydrogels. The expression of genes related to electric conduction (i.e., SCN5A, ITPR3, HCN4, KCNJ8, and KCNH2), structure (i.e., MYH7, ACTN2, AKAP6, JPH2, and TTN), energetics (i.e., PRKAA1, PPARGC1A, and SLC2A4), and calcium handling (i.e., CACNA1C, RYR2, CASQ2, PLN, AMPH, TRDN, ATP2A2, CAMK2D) were significantly upregulated in cardiomyocytes in collagen-PEDOT:PSS hydrogels compared to those in collagen hydrogels (Fig. 28C(i,ii)) [90]. Genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (i.e., HK2, PFKM, and PGM2) as well as redox handling (i.e., NNT) were also upregulated. These findings suggested that PEDOT:PSS promoted the maturation of hiPSC-cardiomyocytes. Additionally, genes related to cell-ECM interactions, such as integrins (i.e., ITGB3, ITGAV, ITGA1, ITGB1, ITGA4, and ITGA7), were upregulated, supporting cell adhesion, migration, and signaling in the heart [90]. CDH2, crucial for structural integrity and electrical coupling between cardiomyocytes, was also upregulated, reinforcing the role of PEDOT:PSS in enhancing electrical coupling. Pathway analysis indicated positive enrichment in pathways associated with cardiac muscle development and morphogenesis, as well as membrane action potential and calcium ion regulation, while lipid metabolism and transcriptional factors were negatively enriched (Fig. 28C(iii)) [90]. The maturation of cardiomyocytes in collagen-PEDOT:PSS hydrogels was assessed through RNA-seq of 21-day-old tissues, revealing 7561 DEGs, with 3950 upregulated and 3611 downregulated (Fig. 28C). A comparison of gene expression between collagen-PEDOT:PSS and collagen hydrogels revealed that 69 % of selected maturation genes displayed concordant expression changes between the young versus fetal comparison and 74 % between the adult versus fetal comparison (Fig. 28C(iv)). In addition, Fig. 28C(v) presents a Venn diagram illustrating the number of overlapping DEGs among the three comparisons: collagen-PEDOT:PSS vs. collagen hydrogels, young vs. fetal, and adult vs.fetal [90].",
        "3D printing and electrospinning are remarkable technologies widely used for fabricating complex materials in biomedical applications [198,528,529]. In cardiac TE, integrating electrically conductive materials with biopolymer-based polymers presents a promising approach to construct advanced electroconductive composite hydrogel scaffolds. These scaffolds closely mimic the complex nature, architecture, properties, and functions of native cardiac tissues [49,96]. Significant challenges persist in developing multifunctional scaffolds that closely replicate the diverse features, properties and functions of native cardiac tissues.",
        "A large number of studies have been published regarding cardiac TE [60,161,368,409]. One major issue in the field remains the use of cell lines that are not informative. H9c2 cells, often termed cardiomyoblasts, proliferate and, when differentiated, form myotubes with no contractile function. In addition, these cells express several skeletal muscle genes [229,371,422,426]. HL-1 cells are atrial cardiomyocytes. Notably, atrial and left ventricular cardiomyocytes exhibit significant differences, for example, in terms of morphology and contractility. Left ventricular cardiomyocytes are generally larger, possess more organized sarcomeric structures, and demonstrate stronger contractile capabilities than atrial cardiomyocytes, which are smaller and less contractile. These differences are important when selecting appropriate cell models for cardiac TE, as they can affect the functionality and behavior of the engineered tissues [221,530]. There are also other cell lines used that are not very representative in the field, as they do not exhibit the proper characteristics of cardiomyocytes. Even hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are suboptimal for several reasons, as they, for example, exhibit a fetal to neonatal cardiomyocyte developmental stage [54,291].",
        "The application of electroconductive materials in cardiac 10.13039/100024656TE has garnered significant attention due to their potential to support and enhance cardiomyocyte function, especially in relation to electrical signaling and conduction. While the effects of electroconductive materials, such as PEDOT [90,394], PPy [375], PANi [60], AuNPs [54,439], graphene [420,531] and CNTs [368], on cardiomyocytes have been well documented, less is known about how these materials influence other cardiac cell types, such as cardiac fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. These non-myocyte cells are an integral part of the cardiac tissue microenvironment, contributing to the structural integrity, ECM remodeling, and vascularization processes essential for functional TE. The interactions between electroconductive materials and these non-myocyte populations are still underexplored, with limited studies examining how electroconductivity might modulate their behavior, phenotype, or functionality. Understanding these interactions is interesting for creating more comprehensive models of the heart that replicate not only the electrical properties of cardiac tissue but also the cellular diversity necessary for tissue regeneration.",
        "Despite the promising potential of electroconductive materials, a significant gap in the field lies in demonstrating enhanced force generation due to the incorporation of these materials into cardiac tissue constructs. While there is substantial evidence supporting the idea that electrical conductivity can promote more synchronized cardiomyocyte beating and improve their electrophysiological properties, few studies have definitively shown that these enhancements translate into measurable improvements in force generation or mechanical contractility. Cardiac function, particularly in the context of force generation and contraction, is paramount for the long-term success of engineered tissues, especially when considering the goal of using these constructs in regenerative medicine or in vivo applications. Further research is needed to assess whether electroconductive scaffolds not only support electrical signaling but also promote the mechanical strength and force production necessary for heart tissue functionality.",
        "Another key challenge in the development of electrically conductive hydrogels for cardiac TE is the successful 3D bioprinting of cell-laden conductive bioink materials to create functional cardiac tissues with high cell density. While 3D bioprinting technologies have made significant strides in fabricating complex tissue architectures, including vascularized constructs and heart tissue models, no study has yet demonstrated the successful 3D bioprinting of high-density cell-laden electroconductive materials to get functional cardiac tissues. Maintaining high cardiac cell viability in cell-laden electroconductive bioinks during 3D bioprinting presents a significant challenge in cardiac TE. 3D bioprinting process which involves layer-by-layer deposition of cell-laden bioinks to create tissue constructs, exposes cells to various stresses, including mechanical forces, thermal changes, and potentially cytotoxic materials. Shear stress from the extrusion-based printing process is particularly detrimental, as it can damage cell membranes, leading to cell death or impaired functionality. Additionally, while electroconductive materials enhance electrical signaling, they may introduce cytotoxicity if not properly optimized, making it essential to balance conductivity and biocompatibility. Maintaining an appropriate microenvironment is also important, as factors like pH, temperature, and nutrient supply must be carefully controlled to support cell survival and proliferation. Any imbalance in these factors can lead to cell death and undermine tissue integrity. The spatial arrangement of cells within the bioink is another challenge, as the non-uniform distribution or cell clumping can hinder tissue functionality by creating areas of low cell density. To overcome these challenges, researchers are exploring strategies such as optimizing bioink formulations, developing gentler printing techniques, and incorporating protective agents into the bioink to minimize cell stresses and support their growth and function. Moreover, embedded 3D bioprinting, which utilizes low-viscosity bioinks and a gel-in-a-gel approach, offers a promising method for fabricating complex tissue models by embedding cell-laden bioinks in a supportive hydrogel. This technique minimizes gravitational effects and enables the precise deposition of bioinks, which are stabilized after printing [532,533]. However, challenges arise when attempting to print high-density cell-laden hydrogels, as the increased viscosity from higher cell concentrations conflicts with the low viscosity typically required for successful embedded bioprinting. The incorporation of cells into bioinks for bioprinting cell-laden constructs can significantly alter the rheological properties of the resulting formulation, particularly its viscosity. The magnitude of this effect is influenced by several parameters, including the cell type, cell concentration, and the physicochemical characteristics of the base bioink. For instance, when highly viscous bioinks are combined with dense cell suspensions, the resulting mixture often exhibits complex rheological behavior, which can adversely impact both printability and the uniformity of cell distribution within the construct [534,535]. To date, no studies have successfully demonstrated the bioprinting of high-cell-density electroconductive hydrogels using embedded technologies like SWIFT (sacrificial writing in functional tissue) and SPIRIT (sequential printing in a reversible ink template), indicating a significant gap in the current literature. Additionally, while embedded bioprinting holds potential for overcoming size limitations in organ fabrication, difficulties persist in achieving functional integration of vascular networks and maintaining cell viability during prolonged printing durations. 10.13039/100014337Furthermore, the clinical translation of bioprinted tissues is hindered by challenges such as material compatibility, support material removal, and the need for rigorous in vitro and in vivo evaluations.",
        "Furthermore, the current body of literature on the in vivo applications of electroconductive biopolymer-based hydrogels fabricated using 3D printing, electrospinning technologies, or a combination of both for cardiac tissue engineering remains extremely limited. While these hydrogels show promise due to their conductive properties, as well as their potential for in vitro mimicking the electromechanical and functional characteristics of native cardiac tissues, the lack of comprehensive results on their in vivo applications underscores the need for future research focused on evaluating their biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, and functional efficacy in cardiac live models. Further investigation is particularly necessary to assess the long-term integration, biodegradability, and impact of these 3D printed and/or electrospun electrically conductive hydrogels on cardiac regeneration, as well as their potential to overcome the challenges posed by the complex environment of heart tissue. Such studies are crucial for advancing the clinical translation of electroconductive biopolymer-based hydrogels for cardiac repair and regeneration.",
        "Moreover, the long-term effects of implanted electroconductive patches in cardiac tissues remain largely unexplored, particularly regarding the degradation of electroconductive materials over time. These electroconductive materials, often employed to enhance electrical conductivity and support tissue regeneration, face significant challenges related to their breakdown and the subsequent effects within the living organisms. As the electroconductive patch degrades, it may release various degradation products that can provoke inflammatory responses in the surrounding tissue. Depending on their chemical nature, these products could alter the local microenvironment, leading to chronic inflammation, immune reactions, and fibrosis, ultimately impairing tissue healing and integration. The degradation of the material may also result in a loss of mechanical and electrical properties of the cardiac, which are crucial for the regeneration process. For instance, the breakdown of the electroconductive material may reduce its ability to facilitate proper electrical signaling across the myocardium, hindering the restoration of normal heart rhythm and function. In addition, the degradation products of electroconductive materials could potentially be toxic to surrounding cells, either directly through chemical interactions or indirectly by disrupting cellular functions and signaling pathways. This toxicity may lead to cell death or inhibition of tissue regeneration, extending healing times and decreasing the long-term success of the TE strategy. Furthermore, the impact of degradation on the ECM is another concern, as the materials used in these patches could interfere with the ECM structural and biochemical properties, potentially compromising cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Importantly, the interactions between the degradation products and the surrounding tissue have not been fully characterized, leaving a gap in our understanding of how these degradation products influence tissue integration and long-term functional outcomes. Therefore, comprehensive studies on the degradation mechanisms of electroconductive materials, as well as their impact on both the electrical and mechanical properties of the patches in which they are incorporated, are essential to ensure the development of safe, functional, and high-performance implantable patches for cardiac repair and regeneration.",
        "Finally, one of the most challenging goals in cardiac TE is the reconstruction of Purkinje fibers, which are responsible for the coordinated contraction of the ventricles. These fibers are specialized for fast electrical conduction and are crucial for maintaining the synchronized heartbeat. The incorporation of electroconductive materials into scaffolds designed to recreate these fibers could play a significant role in advancing TE strategies aimed at controlling ventricular contraction. However, there is still much to learn about how electroconductive materials can be specifically tailored to mimic the function and structure of Purkinje fibers. The ability to control the formation of Purkinje-like fibers within engineered cardiac tissues would be a major breakthrough in creating tissues that more closely resemble native heart function. This would require not only advancements in electroconductive materials but also a deeper understanding of the signaling pathways, cellular organization, and mechanical properties that govern Purkinje fiber development and function. Further studies should explore how electroconductive scaffolds can be used to direct the formation of these specialized structures, and how they can be incorporated into larger-scale engineered tissues for functional cardiac regeneration.",
        "Looking ahead, significant advancements in electrically functional biopolymer-based hydrogels for cardiac TE and heart-on-a-chip platforms are essential for the development of more effective cardiac treatments. A shift is occurring from traditional in vitro studies to more rigorous in vivo research, where the safety, biocompatibility, and functional efficacy of these hydrogels are thoroughly evaluated within the complex environment of a living organism. In vivo studies are necessary to understand the interactions between the hydrogel materials and the native cardiac tissue, and to assess long-term effects such as degradation, immune responses, and tissue integration. Positive results from these studies could provide a strong foundation for future clinical applications, potentially revolutionizing treatments for cardiovascular diseases by improving tissue repair, heart regeneration, and the management of heart failure. Simultaneously, personalized medicine is becoming an integral part of this progress, utilizing patient-specific genetic and cardiac data to create tailored 3D-printed and electrospun hydrogel constructs that optimize treatment outcomes. By customizing these bioinks to meet individual patient profiles, a more precise and effective approach to cardiac repair could be realized, enhancing the overall success of implantable tissue constructs. Moreover, in heart-on-a-chip platforms, microfabrication technologies could play a pivotal role in seamlessly integrating biopolymer-based hydrogels into microscale systems that closely mimic the heart physiology, allowing for more accurate drug screening, disease modeling, and personalized therapy. These advanced systems could replicate the mechanical and electrical properties of human cardiac tissues more accurately, enabling better assessment of pharmacological responses and providing valuable insights into disease progression. Moreover, the integration of real-time monitoring with embedded sensors can enhance the understanding of cellular responses enabling dynamic and continuous observation of the effects of various drugs or treatments. This capability is particularly important for modeling disease states, as it provides more reliable, real-time data on the physiological behavior of cardiac tissues under different conditions.",
        "Given the limited regenerative capacity of the heart and the formation of scar tissue after injury, electroconductive biopolymer-based hydrogel scaffolds hold significant potential for cardiac tissue repair and regeneration. These electroconductive hydrogels are high-performance materials designed to replicate or promote the functionality of native heart tissue in cardiac TE applications. Depending on their composition, these hydrogels can function as a 3D matrix and deliver essential biochemical, mechanical, and electrical signals that support the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of cardiac cells. By incorporating conductive materials into biopolymer matrices, the resulting electroconductive hydrogels exhibit enhanced electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and biological properties, making them ideal for repairing heart tissue following infarction. Recent advancements in 3D printing and electrospinning technologies, alongside evaluations of material biocompatibility in vitro and in animal models, have demonstrated promising results in clinical settings. 3D printing and electrospinning enable the precise deposition of fiber/hydrogel constructs, often incorporating cells and bioactive molecules to closely replicate the architecture, properties, and functions of native cardiac tissue. Numerous studies have highlighted the successful application of biofabricated electroconductive hydrogels in cardiac TE offering a promising approach to overcoming challenges in cardiovascular regenerative medicine.",
        "For myocardial regeneration, a combination of new therapies and existing treatments to induce both endogenous and exogenous effects is required for maximum efficacy. Strategies combining nanofiber-based networks, such as those produced by electrospinning, with hydrogels in 3D printing technologies to produce fibrous/hydrogel scaffolds may serve as an innovative repair tool for effective cardiac TE. In native cardiac tissue, the myocardium exhibits uniformly aligned cardiac cells in each layer, with a gradual transition of alignment between the cell layers. To be clinically relevant, engineered cardiac tissue scaffolds must not only induce regeneration of a single oriented cardiac layer but also enhance the organization of multiple anisotropic cardiac layers. Thus, designing a 3D tissue model that can individually control cellular orientation and organization in different cell layers would be effective. Furthermore, the specifically aligned fibrous network in the scaffolds can be easily disrupted when used in complex (pre)clinical environments. The preparation of multilayer scaffolds with controlled assembly between layers and nanofiber arrangement is both complex and challenging. More intricate architectured fibrous/hydrogel scaffolds, such as those with more than two or three layers and gradient fiber orientation between interpenetrated layers should not only induce cardiomyocyte alignment and elongation in each layer but also control the relative cellular orientation within the layers in a more sophisticated 3D mimicking environment. These insights highlight the great potential of nanofibrous 3D hydrogel scaffolds produced by combining electrospinning and 3D bioprinting, to engineer 3D multilayer cardiac anisotropy. Future research should focus on optimizing the microstructure and properties of these fibrous hydrogels and integrating cutting-edge technologies to enhance tissue functionality, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life. Major challenges remain to be explored in vivo, including optimizing the technical parameters for fabricating small-diameter nanofibers and considering patient sensitivity to these biomaterial/technology treatments for personalized diagnoses and therapies, due to individual physiological and physical differences.",

        "Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of human death, while myocardial infarction (MI) is the main cause of the high incidence of ischemic heart disease [1,2,3]. MI is defined as sudden ischemic death of myocardial tissue, which is myocardial necrosis caused by acute and persistent ischemia and hypoxia of coronary arteries. Although percutaneous coronary intervention improves early survival, the patient population at risk of heart failure expands [4,5]. Epidemiological studies have shown that the increased incidence of heart failure after infarction has paralleled the decline in acute mortality in recent decades, which will significantly increase the high socio-economic burden and affect the quality of life of patients who survive acute myocardial infarction [6]. There are three main treatments for MI: drug therapy, left ventricular assist device implantation, and heart transplantation. Although the mortality of MI has decreased, the risk of donor heart transplantation and trauma is limited [7]. Furthermore, the ventricular remodeling is negative, which leads to the progressive decline of the cardiac function of myocardial infarction survivors, and there are still some limitations such as irreversible myocardial necrosis and cardiac function. Therefore, it is an important subject of cardiovascular disease research to develop new effective strategies for treating MI.",
        "Nowadays, cardiac tissue reconstruction, prevention of ventricular remodeling and scar tissue formation, and reduction of heart failure and heart rupture have become the focus of new effective strategies [8,9], including the development and application of a variety of biomaterials. Currently, biomaterials developed to promote ischemic myocardial repair include patches, hydrogels, scaffolds, and particles [10,11,12]. It is worth mentioning that hydrogel has the following advantages. (1) It has good biocompatibility and low immunogenicity, and its three-dimensional cross-linked spatial structure might replace damaged myocardium to bear ventricular stress. Injectable hydrogels can be modified to further improve their biological properties, such as mechanical properties and electrical conductivity, enabling them to mimic native myocardium. (2) It can deliver all kinds of active cells, growth factors, drugs, and genes to specific local areas of heart tissue. (3) It can be administered through minimally invasive surgery, which can reduce surgical trauma. (4) It shows the advantages of regeneration and degradation [13,14,15,16,17,18].",
        "Based on the above information, this review aims to focus on the role of hydrogel materials especially injectable hydrogels in the treatment of MI and to explore the therapeutic mechanism of injectable hydrogel combined with stem cells, cytokines, drugs, and genes. Last but not least, the existing problems of injectable hydrogel and the perspectives of using hydrogel formulations in the treatment of MI will also be discussed.",
        "Coronary atherosclerosis will result in a narrowing of the lumen and insufficient blood supply. When collateral circulation is not fully established and blood supply is sharply reduced, myocardial ischemia lasting more than 1 h will lead to MI [19]. After MI, with the decrease of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) level in the endocardium, ischemic heart or susceptible myocardial cells can no longer maintain their structural integrity [20]. In this case, ultrastructural changes occur, resulting in irreversible damage, which eventually leads to apoptosis or necrosis of myocardial cells. In the healing stage, MI has gone through the stages of inflammation, proliferation, and healing [21]. As shown in Figure 1, in the inflammatory phase, the generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) activates the complement system, stimulates the expression of P-selectin, and activates the NF-κB (nuclear transcription factor-κB) system to upregulate the synthesis of cytokines and chemokines [22]. Releases pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1 (interleukin-1), (TNF)-α (tumor necrosis factor-α), and IL-6 (interleukin-6), which further upregulates the expression of CXC and CC chemokines, thereby promoting leukocyte chemotaxis, triggering an inflammatory cascade, while further helping to clear necrotic cells and cellular matrix debris [23,24]. Subsequently, negative regulation of TLR (toll-like receptor) signaling, etc., induces and releases anti-inflammatory molecules thereby transitioning to the proliferative phase. Such as TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β), IL-10 (interleukin-10), aldosterone’s broad lipid-derived mediators, and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), etc., thereby activating anti-inflammatory pathways [25]. Cardiac fibroblasts are transformed into myofibroblasts, and the ECM (extracellular matrix) gradually deposits proteins, during which angiogenesis in the infarcted area provides oxygen and nutrients to the metabolically active mesenchymal cells in the healing infarcted area [26,27]. As the infarcted area heals, a new myocardial matrix is gradually established, scarring is formed, the ventricle dilates to maintain cardiac output and cardiac repair transitions to maturity. Healing of the infarct is intertwined with the geometric remodeling of the chamber, with dramatic changes in ventricular geometry, dilation of the chamber, and thinning of the infarcted portion, leading to ventricular remodeling [28].",
        "The pathological process after MI is a dynamic development process as shown in Figure 2, and the related cardiac tissue cells and factors have biological roles in different stages. Therefore, according to the pathological mechanism of different stages, it requires a rational design of hydrogel materials in the treatment process, in order to conform to the pathological process of MI. In the inflammatory stage, it is a feasible way to improve the curative effect of the hydrogel by inhibiting myocardial apoptosis, promoting degradation or removal of infarct matrix fragments, and reducing the over-expression of pro-inflammatory factors. In the proliferation stage, a hydrogel strategy should be designed to promote the maturation and angiogenesis of fibroblasts, which might be beneficial to the healing of infarction. In the mature stage, functional hydrogels could be designed to prevent excessive ventricular dilatation and to reduce fibrosis or scar formation, in order to effectively prevent complications, such as heart failure.",
        "Hydrogels are useful for drug delivery and tissue engineering [29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. An injectable hydrogel, made of hydrophilic polymers, can be injected in situ into a specific area of myocardial tissue in the form of a solution, with the ability to increase the thickness of the ventricular wall and reshape the left ventricular geometry [38,39]. A sol-gel phase transition occurs upon stimulation, which provides mechanical support for myocardial tissue and promotes myocardial tissue repair [40,41]. As a typical example, a previous report has shown that the synthesized high modulus hydrogel can improve the mechanical properties of the hydrogel by changing the substitution amount of methacrylic acid in the macromolecular polymer of hyaluronic acid methacrylate [42]. More importantly, it could reduce the pressure on the ventricular wall due to poor ventricular remodeling and show smaller infarct expansion and left ventricular dilation. Furthermore, pig myocardial stroma cells after processing could be effectively maintained within in vivo and in vitro myocardial hydrogel matrix at the temperature of 37 °C [43]. This bioactive hydrogel design could achieve in situ injection in the myocardium of a rat, while it could simulate the natural extracellular environment of the myocardium. In this case, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells could in vivo and in vitro migrate to the myocardial matrix [44]. As a result, this bionic ECM hydrogel, which significantly improves cardiac function, has good safety and therapeutic effectiveness [45]. For the other case, injection of synthetic recombinant human collagen type I (RHCI) matrix at the late proliferative stage after MI has successfully restored cardiac mechanical properties and reduced scar size [46], which maintained distal wall thickness and prevented heart enlargement. This hydrogel design provides a bionic platform for safe and effective endogenous tissue repair. Experimental evidence has shown that cardiac function was restored by promoting healing, cardiomyocyte survival, and reducing pathological remodeling of myocardium [47]. At present, hydrogel with alginate as the main component has been applied in the clinical treatment of MI. More interestingly, its therapeutic potential of inhibiting the injury process after MI has been proved in phase I and Phase II clinical trials, while the safety of implantation has also been effectively verified [48,49,50]. The above studies confirmed the preliminary feasibility and the potentials of injectable hydrogel as implantable scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering [51].",
        "Although injectable hydrogel can provide physical stability to infarcted myocardium, structural enhancement and improved biocompatibility might not be good enough to maintain cardiac functions over a long time [50]. Therefore, nowadays, more experimental design ideas are focused on expanding the structure and properties of hydrogel materials [13,52]. A number of in-depth studies were conducted on the mechanism of repairing MI with injectable hydrogel, so as to achieve better repair effects on infarcted myocardium [53]. As a typical example, intra-myocardial injection of chitosan hydrogel was experimentally illustrated to control infarction narrow scope, to retain wall thickness, and to improve heart function. In detail, this chitosan hydrogel could be beneficial for the removal of ROS and the recruitment of chemokines, with the ability to improve the MI microenvironment, to promote the implantation, survival, or homing of stem cells in the ischemic heart, and to accelerate myocardial repair [54]. However, the regulation of chitosan hydrogel on the MI microenvironment is mainly achieved by scavenging ROS, and its effect is relatively limited. Meanwhile, the mechanism of how chitosan hydrogel improves the MI microenvironment, promotes stem cell implantation and survival, and promotes neovascularization and cardiac repair is still unclear [54,55]. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the possibility in repair function by chitosan hydrogels on myocardium. For this purpose, a thermosensitive CSCl-RoY (chitosan chloride-RoY) hydrogel, connected with RoY peptide to CSCl chain through amide bonds, was designed. RoY is a 12 amino acid synthetic peptide (YPHIDSLGHWRR) that specifically binds to the GRP78 (78-kD glucose-regulated protein) receptor, which is mainly expressed on the membrane surface of vascular endothelial cells during hypoxia [56]. Studies have shown that the RoY peptide-modified hydrogels can promote angiogenesis in the hypoxia state after MI and improve cardiac function [54,57]. Compared with CSCl hydrogel only, CSCl-RoY hydrogel can promote the survival, proliferation, migration, and tubular formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells under hypoxia. In this study, the mechanism was investigated. Under hypoxia conditions, RoY ligand in CSCl-RoY hydrogel interacts with the GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein78) receptor on the surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, inducing the endogenization of GRP78 receptor. In this case, the expression upregulation of p-AKT (phosphorylated protein kinase B) and p-ERK1/2 (phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) was detected, and the signaling pathway of cell survival/proliferation was activated (Figure 3a). In addition, starting from the myocardial conductance pathway, the scar after MI blocks the transmission of electrical pulse and delays local contraction, leading to ventricular dysfunction. Furthermore, in previous studies, conductive PPy (polypyrrole) was coupled to chitosan skeleton to prepare a conductive biomaterials [58]. After intramuscular injection, electrical pulse propagation of scar tissue in the body was promoted and synchronous ventricular contraction was reconstructed. Its principles are shown in Figure 3b,c based on the similar design ideas mentioned above. In short, when injected with hydrogel alone, we divided the function of hydrogel in the treatment of myocardial infarction into the following categories: (1) to reduce oxidative stress; (2) to promote angiogenesis; (3) to alleviate ischemia and hypoxia in the infarct area; (4) to inhibit the malignant remodeling caused by metalloproteinases; and (5) to increase the electrical conductivity of myocardium.",
        "ROS is a highly reactive oxygen derivative. As a byproduct of aerobic cell metabolism, ROS acts as a second messenger of signal transduction in regulating calcium processing mechanisms and contractile proteins [60,61]. After MI, excessive ROS acts on protein kinases including calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, resulting in myocardial hypertrophy [60]. Secondly, when the level of ROS is high, oxidative stress might lead to apoptosis or necrosis of myocardial cells. In this case, the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase containing NOX2 (nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases 2) is involved in the process of myocardial remodeling and contraction dysfunction after MI [62]. Based on the idea of reducing the damage caused by oxidative stress, in a large animal model of MI, researchers have demonstrated that injection of a temperature-responsive NIPAAm (N-isopropylacrylamide)-mPEGMA (polyethylene glycol methyl methacrylate) copolymer hydrogel with ROS scavenging properties can reduce ROS, increase wall thickness, and improve MI peripheral function [63]. Hydrogels with the function of scavenging ROS can effectively protect the myocardium from oxidative damage in vivo, such as significantly reducing cell membrane peroxidation and apoptosis, inhibiting inflammation, preserving cardiac function, and promoting left ventricular angiogenesis [64]. ROS increases dramatically after ischemia-reperfusion after MI [65], resulting in channel activity and Ca2+ increased conductance [66]. In this case, intracellular Ca2+ increased stimulation of Ca2+ dependent on biochemical pathways, which leads to the development of myocardial hypertrophy. Additionally, intracellular Ca2+ elevated levels also lead to an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and mitochondrial ROS levels [61,67], which is positive feedback and plays a key role in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy [66,68]. Furthermore, Ratcliffe et al. used nanoparticles mediated dual transmission of antioxidant curcumin and anti-L-type Ca2+ channel peptide, which reduced mitochondrial metabolic activity by scavenging ROS and disrupting cytoskeletal communication between LTCC (L-type Ca2+ channels) and mitochondria [69]. Curcumin and peptide could synergistically reduce ischemic reperfusion damage through different mechanisms, and this combination therapy will be more effective than treatment alone.",
        "One of the methods to treat ischemic tissue after MI is to enhance microvascular perfusion by delivering pro-angiogenic signals. VEGF is one of the most effective pro-angiogenic factors [70]. For example, Stuppd et al. developed a small peptide hydrogel that mimics VEGF for the treatment of MI in vivo [71]. The hydrogel displayed a peptide that mimics VEGF on the surface of nanofibers, which showed enhanced signal and biological activity by activating specific vascular endothelial growth factor receptors. It is found that VEGF could promote angiogenesis better than endothelial cells. In another case, citrate polymer hydrogel synthesized by citric acid and polyethylene glycol diol was injected into the left ventricle of myocardial infarction rats [72]. The citrate degradation by-products promoted angiogenesis and cardiac protection, by activating the PI3K-Akt-mTOR (phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and manipulating the citric acid cycle. With the effective release of MYDGF (myeloid-derived growth factor), this self-degradable hydrogel with an angiogenic effect might have great potential as medical biomaterials.",
        "In addition to oxidative stress, hypoxia is one of the inflammatory characteristics of the tissue microenvironment after severe ischemic myocardial infarction [73,74]. Extremely low oxygen content in the infarct area is the main cause of massive myocardial cell death. At present, it is necessary to develop a method that can continuously deliver oxygen to the MI area [75], and a number of studies have prepared a method that can remove ROS and generate O2 with injectable hydrogel for the treatment of MI [76]. For example, a multi-functional hydrogel under the condition of hypoxia and inflammation can not only remove ROS, but also continue to produce oxygen, with the ability to suppress apoptosis, to increase the proportion of M1/M2 macrophages, to promote angiogenesis, to reduce the effect of the infarction area, thus to regulate MI or adverse tissue microenvironment, and to improve heart function.",
        "After MI, MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) are activated, and the imbalance between MMPs and TIMPs (tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases) leads to left ventricular remodeling after MI [77,78]. Under normal physiological conditions, endogenous MMPs inhibition is achieved by the synthesis and release of TIMPs [79], and the relative TIMP level might not increase in the early period after MI, resulting in an imbalance between endogenous proteolytic activity and inhibition [77]. Therefore, a number of studies used hyaluronic acid hydrogel to locally deliver recombinant rTIMP-3 (recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3) to promote the proliferation of myofibroblasts in the infarction area and effectively block the adverse remodeling after MI [80]. Containing MMPs shearable peptide-crosslinked HA(hyaluronic acid) based hydrogels that are responsive to MMPs [81], rTIMP-3 achieved controllable release and significantly attenuated key indicators of ventricular remodeling, such as left ventricular dilation and thinning of the infarct area at 28 d after MI.",
        "Injectable hydrogel provides structural support for the injured hearts, while conductive injectable hydrogel enhances biological conduction, synchronizes heart contractions, and improves therapeutic effects [82,83]. Zhou et al. introduced GO (graphene oxide) nanoparticles into OPF (oligo (poly (ethylene glycol) fumarate)) hydrogels to prepare a conductive hydrogel, which not only provides mechanical support for the infarct area but also electrically connects isolated cardiomyocytes to intact tissue. In this case, the tissue with synchronize contraction could restore ventricular function and maintain cardiac function, in comparison with injections of non-conductive polymers [84]. At the same time, this study showed that OPF/GO hydrogel can upregulate Cx43 (connexin 43) and gap junction-related protein production, by providing mechanical support and electrical connection between healthy myocardium and cardiomyocytes in scar and by activating Wnt signaling pathways. Furthermore, homogeneous double network hydrogels [85], composed of a rigid/hydrophobic/conductive network of chemically crosslinked PTAA (polythiophen-3-acetic acid) and a flexible/hydrophilic/biocompatibility network of crosslinked MAAG (methacrylate aminated gelatin), could be prepared to tunable properties. In detail, this double network hydrogel can adjust the swelling and mechanical and electrical properties by tuning the ratio of the PTAA network and MAAG network. More importantly, this double network hydrogel can promote the survival and proliferation of BADSCs (brown adipose-derived stem cells) and improve the efficiency of cardiac differentiation of BADSCs. The expression of Cx43 was up-regulated and electrical stimulation could further ameliorate the effect. This hydrogel can be used as an ideal scaffold for cardiac tissue engineering with good mechanical properties. More importantly, hydrogels with excellent electrical conductivity and anti-fatigue properties have strong benefits for cardiac repair [86,87]. The hydrogel obtained by combining the above different functions could also greatly increase the therapeutic efficiency of myocardial infarction [51,88]. The oxidant TEMPOL was integrated into the peptide, and an injectable ROS scavenging/conducting composite hydrogel was constructed through the specific binding between the conducting PPy and the multicomponent co-assembled peptide. As shown in Figure 3d–f, this therapeutic strategy, which combines increasing myocardial conductance and scavenging ROS, can significantly promote cardiac repair [59].",
        "At present, a number of studies have shown that stem cell transplantation technology can be used to repair myocardial injury and improve cardiac function, including ECSs (endogenous cardiac stem cells) [89], HSCs (hematopoietic stem cells) [90], ESCs (embryonic stem cells) [91], MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells) [92], and IPSCs(induced pluripotent stem cells) [93,94], etc. However, the treatment effect is poor due to the lack of adhesion of the transplanted cells. The mechanical loss caused by the beating of the heart, and the poor microenvironment in the infarct area, lead to the low retention rate and survival rate of the transplanted cells [89,95,96]. As an injectable polymeric formulation, hydrogel can provide a three-dimensional growth environment for cells, improve the survival rate of transplanted cells, and significantly improve cardiac function [97]. For example, Christman et al. demonstrated that fibrin hydrogel increased the survival rate of skeletal muscle myoblast transplantation [98], reduced infarct size, and increased blood flow to the ischemic myocardium. In a study of self-assembling peptide NFs (nanofibers) loaded with BMNCs (bone marrow mononuclear cells) [99], NFs injections improved cell retention and improved cardiac function at 28 d after myocardial infarction. Furthermore, these two formulations played a synergistic role in improving cardiac function. BMNCs injections significantly increased systolic function after myocardial infarction but not diastolic function, while combined injection of BMNCs and NFs improved contractility and relaxation function. It is worth mentioning that the performances of hydrogel transplanted stem cells in the treatment of myocardial infarction relied on its formulations. For example, by using hyaluronic acid hydrogel encapsulating BMNCs in the treatment of rat myocardial infarction [100], hyaluronic acid hydrogels have been experimentally proved to prevent mechanical loss and loss of nest apoptosis cells. However, cell apoptosis caused by myocardial ischemia hypoxia was not disturbed. Currently, it is still a challenge to promote the long-term survival of transplanted stem cells in hydrogel. Furthermore, it became more difficult for stem cell survival, upon the appearance of coronary myocardial infarction area of ischemia hypoxia, insufficient blood supply and subsequent inflammation, and myocardial substrate degradation, after the occurrence of myocardial infarction. In this case, it might also be valuable to explore the optimal design of cell encapsulated hydrogel designs, by considering the strategy to improve the transplanted cells survival environment, to increase the protective effect of stem cells, and to achieve the optimization of stem cell function.",
        "The pathological process of myocardial infarction, especially the initial inflammation of myocardial infarction, is closely related to ROS [101]. In detail, cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts could be induced to produce a series of ROS, in case of local myocardial ischemia and hypoxia after coronary artery infarction, reperfusion injury caused by vascular recalculation, or intra-muscular injection of hydrogels. These ROS are mainly O2−, H2O2, HO2·, ·OH, which could cause serious damage to myocardial cells and exogenous transplanted stem cells [102,103]. To prevent this undesired effect, a thermosensitive CSCl-GSH (chitosan chloride glutathione) hydrogel was designed to effectively scavenge superoxide anion [104], hydroxyl free radical, or DPPH free radical, and to inhibit oxidative stress injury or apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. In 2017, Wang et al. prepared a series of fullerenol/alginate saline gels with antioxidant activity [105], which can prevent the adverse signal transduction in cells after myocardial infarction and reduce the oxidative stress damage caused by ROS after myocardial infarction. Furthermore, the experimental results showed that fullerenol/sodium alginate hydrogel can inhibit JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) signaling pathway, activate ERK (extracellular regulated protein kinases) and p38 (P38 MAPK) signaling pathways, reduce cell apoptosis, and improve the survival or proliferation of BADSCs. As shown in Figure 4a, MSCs were encapsulated in a hydrogel consisting of ROS-scavenging HBPAK (hyperbranched polymers), O2-generating CAT (catalase), and HA-MA (methacrylate hyaluronic acid). MSCs can maintain good viability, inhibit the activation of ROS-induced JNK/p38 apoptosis signaling pathway, and greatly improve the survival rate under oxidative stress conditions [106]. More importantly, the apoptosis level of mesenchymal stem cells also decreased in a hypoxia environment. As a result, mesenchymal stem cells were able to survive in this anti-ROS and anti-hypoxia composite, thereby enhancing the viability of the infarcted heart and promoting angiogenesis (as shown in Figure 4b–h). At present, some hydrogel materials with good electrical conductivity have a good effect in combination therapy with loaded stem cells [107]. While promoting myocardial conductance, they can also play a role in scavenging ROS to promote stem cell survival. A modified graphene oxide nanomaterial, which is both an electroactive component and can greatly scavenge ROS [108]. When this material was incorporated into silk protein hydrogels, binding to stem cells improved cardiac repair efficiency.",
        "Injection of a bionic matrix into the myocardial infarction area not only significantly improves cardiac function, but also has certain safety and can regulate the physiological activity of stem cells [51,109]. For example, the synthesis of IGF-1C (insulin-like growth factor C) structure domain polypeptide chitosan hydrogel was conducted and was proved to simulate the microenvironment for stem cell survival [110]. This hydrogel provided good cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation of the microenvironment, thereby enhancing the activity of stem cells. Yao et al. demonstrated that such hydrogel could promote the proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and angiogenesis of human PMSCs (placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells) in vitro [111]. Combined intramyocardial injection with PMSCs could improve the survival of PMSCs in the myocardial microenvironment. Meanwhile, a combined injection could promote angiogenesis in the infarcted area and reduce inflammation, prevent undesired infarct tissue fibrosis, and improve cardiac function. In addition, Yoon et al. used self-assembled biodegradable PA (peptide amphiphilic) nanomaterials to improve the therapeutic effect of PSCs (Pluripotent Stem Cells) derived CMs (cardiomyocytes) [112] and introduced a fibrin-derived cell adhesion ligand (RGDS) into PA to promote cell adhesion and survival. The incorporation of NMP-2 (nuclear matrix protein 2) biodegradable sequences enables the scaffold to be gradually degraded and replaced by the natural ECM produced by surrounding cells. This design mimicked the physical and biochemical complexity of natural ECM. In another case, folic acid peptide hydrogels were proved to mimic the natural ECM, with no immunogenicity and cell toxicity [113]. Compared with the traditional peptide hydrogel, this composite hydrogel had better gelling properties and biocompatibility and could provide a comfortable environment in vivo for IPSCs. It significantly improved the retention and survival of IPSCs cells in vivo, increased the number of IPSCs cells with the ability to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, and amplified the effect of IPSCs on angiogenesis through differentiation and paracrine.",
        "It has been studied that when loaded with cells, hydrogels are less satisfactory in modulating the therapeutic effect of delivered stem cells and have a lower ability to support the adhesion and proliferation of encapsulated cells [114]. To solve this issue, Wang et al. modified pNIPAAM (Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide)) hydrogels with SWCNTs (single-walled carbon nanotubes) [115]. PNIPAAm/SWCNTs hydrogels showed high bioactivity on BASCs (bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells), by promoting BASCs cell adhesion and proliferation, in comparison with PNIPAAm hydrogels alone. An injectable natural polymer hydrogel with electrical conductivity as a cell delivery vehicle not only has excellent biocompatibility and cell delivery ability for UCMSCs (umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells), but more importantly, can promote the growth of UCMSCs, proliferation, and differentiation, thereby improving damaged myocardial tissue and rebuilding myocardial function [116]. The addition of chemokines to the hydrogel, such as SDF-1α (Stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha), which promotes homing of stem cells in the infarcted area, also could increase their retention [117]. In addition, injection of ECM hydrogels encapsulating MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells) by means of IPC (intrapericardial cavity) injection can significantly solve the problem of low cell retention. The results showed that MSCs had a higher cardiac retention rate than IM injection when delivered by the IPC route, and the heart repair capacity of the infarcted rats was enhanced [118].",
        "After MI, the infarct area is severely ischemic and hypoxic, and the cell survival rate is poor under hypoxic conditions. In this case, establishing a continuous oxygen delivery system in the infarct area might greatly improve the survival rate of transplanted stem cells and cardiomyocytes [75,119]. An oxygen release system has been prepared for in situ oxygen release in myocardial infarction [120], which consisted of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) released microspheres, catalase, and an injectable thermosensitive hydrogel. The design was utilized to improve the retention of microspheres and stem cells in cardiac tissue during the myocardial injection. Microspheres are based on polylactic PLGA (poly (lactide-co-glycolide)), PVP (poly (2-vinlypyrridione)) and H2O2. The breakage of microspheres by catalase might produce oxygen, which lasted for at least two weeks, in a similar manner to myocardial infarction (1% O2). In this case, the introduction of oxygen release in hydrogel significantly enhanced cell survival, with no cell death observation after 7 d culture. Cells even grew after 7 d and realized cardiac differentiation. In addition to the release of oxygen by hydrogen peroxide, in situ oxygen production was also studied by using an oxygen-producing hydrogel composed of CaO2 (peroxide calcium) loaded with GelMA (gelatin methacryloyl), which could produce oxygen under hypoxic conditions (1% O2) over 5 d and was sufficient to relieve the metabolic stress of the cardiac side population cells coated in this composite hydrogel [121]. More importantly, this composite hydrogel design significantly improved cell survival, compared to GelMA-only formulation.",
        "Improving oxygen partial pressure is another way to increase oxygen content in the infarct area. Guan et al. developed a family of PFC (perfluorocarbon)-coupled hydrogels that could increase oxygen partial pressure to improve cell survival under hypoxic conditions, and these hydrogels have high oxygen preservation and fast gelation properties [122]. Fast gelation enables rapid solidification of the hydrogel, which could effectively fix cells in tissues and increase cell retention rate. The experimental results showed that under hypoxic conditions (1% O2), the partial pressure of oxygen of the hydrogel without PFC (pO2 = 28.1 ± 2.9 mm Hg) was significantly lower than that of DPBS (Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline) (pO2 = 35.0 ± 3.1 mm Hg), while the partial pressure of oxygen was significantly greater than that of DPBS after adding 10% PFC to the hydrogel (pO2 = 75.8 ± 8.2). MSCs were encapsulated in PFC hydrogels and cultured under 1% O2 for 14 days. The cells survived and proliferated, while the cells in the control group hydrogels died massively. Hypoxic myocardial infarction areas can also be widely used.",
        "The addition of active factors into the cell growth environment could enhance the biological function of the original stem cells. For example, by using biotin-streptomycin affinity, IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) could be linked to the self-assembly peptide. CPCs (cardiac progenitor cells) have an IGF-1-IGF-1 receptor system, which can promote their survival and growth [123]. Combined intracardial injection of CPCs and this self-organized polypeptide nanofiber hydrogel showed that the volume of regenerated cardiomyocytes increased and the infarct size decreased [124,125]. HE-cad-Fc (Human E-cadherin fusion protein) can effectively promote the paracrine activity of MSCs (esenchymal stem cells). PLGA (poly (lactic-coglycolic acid)) microparticles modified with hE-cad-Fc were combined with hMSCs (human mesenchymal stem cells) to construct functionalized MSC aggregates. Encapsulating them into injectable hydrogels could effectively improve the MI microenvironment compared to the direct encapsulation of MSCs by hydrogels [126]. On the other hand, adenovirus could be utilized to transfect MSCs by genetic modification. HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) could also be beneficial to MSCs [127], with significant apoptosis reduction and MSCs growth promotion. Furthermore, cytokines could also promote the differentiation of stem cells. Chan et al. transplanted FGF-10 (fibroblast growth factor-10) with self-assembled polypeptide nanofibers in combination with ESCs or IPSCs into the infarct area of mice [128]. The experimental results showed that ESCs and IPSCs cells could differentiate into cardiac cells. For the other case, a nitric oxide release controlled hydrogel, which is catalyzed by β galactosidase, was found to promote the secretion of angiogenic cytokines by AD-MSCS (adipose-derived β-mesenchymal stem cells) [129]. Thus, by promoting angiogenesis and AD-MSCS survival, this hydrogel improves cardiac function after MI by enhancing AD-MSCS implantation and paracrine effect. However, the field is still in its infancy and needs to study the role of more cytokines in stem cell differentiation.",
        "The paracrine effect of stem cells plays an important role in promoting the survival and angiogenesis of cardiomyocytes in the infarcted area, while the paracrine effect is mainly mediated by EV (extracellular vesicles) [130], which could be exosomes as the most abundant sub-vesicles. Compared with stem cells, stem cell-derived exosomes not only have the same beneficial functions but also have the ability to prevent the trigger of immune responses and to reduce the heterologous risk of implantation. In this case, exosomes might serve as another effective strategy for the treatment of ischemic cardiovascular disease [131,132]. For example, exosomes with high miR-675 (micro ribonucleic acid-675) content were obtained by transfecting exosome-derived mother cells with miR-675 molecules, in which miR-675 inhibited senescence and damage-induced phenotypes by targeting the TGF-β1-Smad2/3 (transforming growth factor β1-small mothers against decapentaplegic 2/3) signaling pathway [133]. The exosomes were encapsulated with a functional polypeptide hydrogel, while its myocardial injection inhibited inflammatory response and fibrosis levels, significantly improving cardiac function [134]. Since the immune system plays a central role in both the inflammatory and repair phases after MI [135], it has been found that DCs (dendritic cells) derived DEXs (exosomes) are involved in antigen presentation, immune activation, and inhibition. It is worth mentioning that DEXs can improve cardiac function through CD4+ T cells [136]. DEXs were combined with alginate hydrogel [137]. After myocardial injection, the hydrogel had better effects on immune regulation, anti-apoptosis, promotion of angiogenesis, and increase in infarct wall thickness [138]. This report also explored the mechanism of DEXs in improving cardiac function. DEXs have been found to activate regulatory Tregs (Regulatory T cells), which further regulates macrophage polarization and enables macrophages to metastasize to M2-type cells. This immunotherapy will be a novel strategy for treating myocardial infarction [138]. In addition, the exosomes were combined with a conductive hydrogel that matches the conductivity of the native myocardium to obtain the conductive Gel@Exo system. It can significantly improve the interaction between cells, promote cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and have a significant therapeutic effect on MI [139].",
        "Upon the combination of hydrogel with functional factor/protein, drug, and gene for myocardial infarction treatment, it mainly plays a role in local delivery and controllable release. Injectable hydrogel forms a stable solid scaffold in the infarct area after coagulation, and the wrapped factor/protein, drug, and gene are continuously released to avoid their rapid metabolism [140,141,142]. Injectable hydrogel systems can out-performance traditional drug delivery methods, due to their advantages such as low invasiveness, high efficiency, and sustained local delivery [41,50].",
        "The treatment of myocardial infarction by stem cells is mainly due to the paracrine role of stem cells secreting various bioactive factors in the myocardium [143], such as VEGF, PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1) [144,145], etc. The introduction of bioactive factors is one of the approaches to treat myocardial infarction. The continuous release of hydrogel had a slow-release effect on factors and proteins in myocardial infarction. For example, FGFs (fibroblast growth factors), a family of growth factors initially identified to promote fibroblast growth, promote cardiac repair through pro-angiogenesis, anti-apoptotic, and survival mechanisms [146]. As a bioactive factor deposit, ROS-sensitive cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels were prepared, with the ability to respond to the microenvironment where excessive ROS were generated after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury or myocardial infarction [147]. This hydrogel was experimentally proved to show bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) delivery ability and experienced fast degradation in a ROS-rich environment for myocardial repair. This design achieved enhanced retention of BFGF in the pericardium and controllable bFGF release into the heart muscle in an “on-demand” manner.",
        "A number of proteins and peptides can also play a certain role in promoting cardiac function recovery [148,149]. For example, angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) binds to integrin and activates the presurvival pathway to promote cardiomyocyte survival, while short sequence QHREDGS peptide is the binding site of Ang1 and integrin to support cardiomyocyte adhesion and survival [150]. Therefore, researchers tried to fix the pro-survival peptide QHREDGS on the chitosan collagen hydrogel as an integrin-binding ligand, and interacted with the integrin of cardiomyocytes [151]. Experimental results showed that this design significantly improved the shape and function of the heart, including a 53% improvement in scar thickness, a 34% reduction in the scar area, a 35% improvement in shortened fraction, and a 62% improvement in ejection fraction.",
        "Microangiogenesis is one of the effective methods to inhibit ventricular remodeling and improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction. However, vascular regeneration is a complex process requiring the participation of many factors, and a single factor might lead to vascular leakage and immaturity [152]. VEGF can promote the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, so as to promote the generation of new blood vessels in the infarction area, and to inhibit myocardial fibrosis in late myocardial infarction [153]. In the late stage of angiogenesis, PDGF-BB (platelet-derived growth factor-BB) could stimulate the smooth muscle cells to the newly formed blood vessels, and promote the perfection of the maturity, and function of blood vessels [154]. It has been proved that alginate hydrogel combined with VEGF and PDGF-BB could induce angiogenesis and function improvement, in comparison with single factor treatment only after myocardial infarction [155]. By designing VEGF embedding fibrin gel and PDGF embedding heparin-based coagulant, the system provides a rapid release of VEGF, while the slow and sustained release of PDGF upon single injection [156]. In comparison with the single factor approach, this composite drug delivery system is effective in improving cardiac function, ventricular wall thickness, angiogenesis, myocardial survival, and reducing fibrosis or inflammation in the infarct area. Therefore, the matching of active factors with different properties and the controlled release of different components in different stages will make them play a synergistic role in myocardial infarction and greatly increase the therapeutic efficiency [157].",
        "In addition to combination therapy between cytokines, they can also work together with bioactive proteins. For example, BMP9 (bone morphogenetic protein 9) can effectively slow down the process of myocardial fibrosis by inhibiting the action of TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor β1) [158]. By taking these advantages, SF (silk fibroin) protein microspheres were used as the carrier of BMP9. These microspheres were added into the alginate containing VEGF and crosslinked with calcium gluconate to form a composite hydrogel [159]. This composite hydrogel can rapidly release VEGF to promote angiogenesis in the early MI and continuously release BMP9 to inhibit fibrosis formation in the long MI. In this case, the biological activity of proteins could be maintained to fit the timings of each stage of myocardial infarction, which effectively accelerated angiogenesis in MI mouse models, inhibited fibrosis formation, and enhanced cardiac function (Figure 5a–c).",
        "Nanomaterials and microspheres with bioactive factors wrapping or adsorption could be mixed into hydrogel to prolong the diffusion time and treatment effectiveness, to improve the myocardial repair rate, and to produce more favorable effects on tissue repair. For example, SF protein microspheres were prepared by a microfluidic device. IGF-1 was physically adsorbed onto SF microspheres. These microspheres were loaded into alginate brine gel to enhance the sustained release of IGF-1 [161]. Compared with the SF-free microsphere system, the composite hydrogel can release IGF-1 relatively slowly and continuously. Furthermore, intramuscular injection of complex hydrogels reduced infarct size and improved cardiac function after 28 d. To address the release limitation problem, a dual-function MI-responsive on-demand growth factor release system was developed to promote angiogenesis and inhibit cardiac remodeling by targeting MMP (matrix metalloproteinase)-2/9 upregulated after MI. By combining collagen amine with GSH (glutathione) sulfhydryl group, GSH-modified collagen hydrogels were prepared [162]. The recombinant protein GST-TIMP-bFGF was synthesized by the fusion of bFGF with GST (glutathione s-transferase) and MMP-2/9 shearable peptide PLGLAG (TIMP). The specific binding of GST and GSH significantly increased the loading capacity of GST-TIMP-bFGF in collagen-GSH hydrogel. During myocardial infarction, the TIMP peptide wrapped between GST and bFGF responds to MMP and was released on demand, which promoted angiogenesis and reduced cardiac remodeling through synchronous control of binding and responsive release, indicating a promising treatment strategy for ischemic heart disease.",
        "Curcumin, as an effective component of Chinese traditional medicine curcumin, has a significant cardiac protective effect on reperfusion injury, inhibiting ventricular remodeling caused by pressure load or myocardial infarction and improving cardiac function. However, curcumin has poor water solubility and low bioavailability [163]. Hydrogel-loaded curcumin will significantly improve its targeting activity and promote the sustained release. For example, a curcumin carrier hydrogel reduced cardiomyocytes apoptosis and hypoxia-reoxygenation-injury-induced ROS formation by maintaining Cx43 phosphorylation [164]. This design also promoted autophagy, reduced mitochondrial damage, and activated the JAK2/STAT3 (Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway. Furthermore, in situ injection of curcumin and NO into hydrogel will exert a synergistic effect to promote angiogenesis [165]. As another example, natural ingredient colchicine has an anti-inflammatory effect, while its systemic toxicity and narrow therapeutic window restricted its biomedical application [166,167]. In order to solve this issue, a polymeric hydrogel loaded with colchicine was designed and showed its ability to effectively relieve heart inflammation [168], to inhibit myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis, to improve cardiac function and structure, and to increase the survival rate of mice, without severe systemic toxicity.",
        "TIIA (Tashinone IIA), one of the main active components of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge, has been widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in China. It could significantly improve the cardiac function of infarcted myocardium [169], while its poor solubility, short half-life, and low drug loading of loading materials limit its application [170,171]. However, TIIA can form TIIA nanoparticles through the hydrophobic self-assembly method. In this case, the researcher deposited PDA (pyridoxylamine) layer in situ on TIIA nanoparticles to prepare core-shell TIIA@PDA nanoparticles, which had a high drug loading capacity. On the other hand, in order to restore cardiac function after myocardial infarction [172], hyperbranched ROS-sensitive macromer HB-PBAE (hyperbranched-Poly(β-amino esters)) with polyacrylate terminal group was synthesized by dynamic controlled Michael addition method. HB-PBAE was crosslinked with HA-SH (thio-hyaluronic acid) to form in situ hydrogel. Chemical crosslinking of thiocyanate and quinone groups on PDA was performed. In this case, TIIA@PDA NPs (nanoparticles) could be captured. Injection of ROS-sensitive hydrogels enhanced by TIIA@PDA NPs into infarcted hearts reversed the harmful microenvironment and inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors, such as IL-1β (interleukin 1β), IL-6 (interleukin 6), and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α), thereby restoring myocardial function.",
        "In addition to realizing high drug load and local sustained release, nanomaterials also have application in dual drug delivery systems [173], which can realize independent release of different drugs [174]. For example, tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) is commonly used for the treatment of large and small vessel myocardial infarction. The small molecule ROCK (Rho-associated kinase) inhibitor Y-27632 could eliminate the pathological process of fibrosis [175]. A dual drug delivery system was designed using a fibrin-specific poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) nanohydrogel, composed of a core-shell colloidal hydrogel structure. The architecture consists of a highly crosslinked nanogel core and loosely crosslinked shell to control the load and release of two different MI therapies. tPA would be mainly divided into relatively loose crosslinking shells, and diffusion of Y-27632 took place through crosslinked gel core layer. This design is the pioneer report of tPA release to solve primary myocardial infarction, occlusion, and fibrin deposition issues. Furthermore, the persistently released Y-27632 could block fibrosis pathogenesis and progress of key cellular responses to prevent heart scarring [160], It also addressed the need to rebuild blood flow and inhibit myocardial fibrosis after I/R injury (Figure 5d). Inspired by Ferrero’s core-shell structure, another hydrophobic DMOG (dimethyloxy glycine) NPs as core and a water-soluble drug EGCG (epigallocatechin-3-gallate) encapsulated by dopamine were synthesized. EGCG was within a simulated nano-carrier composed of thick PDA shells formed by self-polymerization through π-π interaction, which had the triadic ability to load two different drugs [176]. In this case, an injectable hydrogel was obtained with the ability to eliminate ROS and acted as a cross-linking agent to HA-SH. Ferrero-like NPs and HA-SH could rapidly form hydrogels with stable mechanical properties, strong ROS capture ability, and programmed release of EGCG and DMOG. After four weeks of myocardial infraction in rats, ejection fraction (EF) increased by 23.7%, infarct area decreased by 21.1%, and fibrosis area decreased by 24.4%.",
        "Hydrogel-loaded multi-drug cocktail therapy for myocardial infarction is one of the ways of multi-factor combined therapy in the treatment of myocardial infarction. For example, hyaluronic acid hydrogel was designed for myocardial joint injection, with the loading of platelet-rich plasma, allopurinol, ascorbic acid, and ibuprofen. This multifactor combination strategy could effectively thicken the infarcted myocardium, improve the host cell vitality, and realize attenuation of myocardial remodeling or dysfunction after myocardial infarction in pig animal models [177]. Combined infusion control might also have synergistic effects. For example, it might potentially improve the function of damaged myocardium while alleviating adverse cardiac remodeling after acute myocardial infarction. As a typical case, AST NPs (astragaloside IV nanoparticles) were prepared by a hydrophobic self-assembly method, and the hyperbranched polymers PEGDA-PBA (polyethylene glycol diacrylate 4-vinylbenzene boronic acid) and HA-SH formed in situ hydrogel to adsorb AST NPs for drug targeting and sustained release [178]. In the meanwhile, the hydrogel was doped with GNRs (gold nanorods) to provide electrical stimulation, which significantly improved myocardial infarction-induced cardiac dysfunction and cardiac remodeling by stimulating angiogenesis, promoting cell-cell signal transduction, and inhibiting apoptosis.",
        "With the development of gene transfer technology, introducing gene therapy for cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure has been gradually arriving at the stage of clinical trials [179,180]. It is worth mentioning that non-viral transfection vectors were of satisfying stability and biological safety [181]. In the case of using hydrogels as non-viral gene delivery vectors, it might also show good biocompatibility as a gene delivery carrier and prolonged gene expression [182,183]. As a typical case, the luciferase plasmid loaded within temperature-responsive hydrogels showed a four times increase in gene expression in mice, in comparison with naked plasmids only [184]. While upon HVEGF (human vascular endothelial growth factor) plasmid could be loaded in gel formulation within the infarction area, continuous HVEGF expression might increase capillary density and vascular formation in an effective manner.",
        "In another case, RNAi (ribonucleic acid interference) is an effective gene silencing technology, and the local targeting RNAi therapy strategy has strong specificity and high efficiency in the treatment of heart disease [185,186,187]. Previous reports have synthesized the plasmid of ACE-shRNA (angiotensin-converting enzyme-short hairpin RNA) [188]. The DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sequence of rat ACE-shRNA was cloned into pgenesil-1 plasmid and mixed with Dex-PCL-HEMA/PNIPAAm (dextran-poly(e-caprolactone)-2-hydroxylethylmethacrylate-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel [189]. The hydrogel loaded with ACE-shRNA plasmid prolongates the expression time of the gene in vivo, thus prolonging the silence time of the ACE gene and achieving greater myocardial protection. This method of silencing the ACE gene could completely block the effect of ACE after myocardial infarction compared with lowering Ang II (Human angiotension Ⅱ) level with ACE inhibitor [190]. In addition, the induction of MSCs by microRNA and cardiomyocytes combined with hydrogel can improve the differentiation efficiency of MSCs into iCMs (induced cardiomyocyte-like cells) to improve the cardiac function of the MI model after transplantation [191]. In particular, miR-21-5p (microRNA-21-5p), which is highly expressed in endothelial cells, can stimulate angiogenesis by targeting anti-angiogenic genes [192]. miR-21-5p was loaded with MSN (mesoporous silica nanoparticles) with anti-inflammatory potential, and the complex was loaded with pH-responsive hydrogel to obtain Gel@MSN/miR-21-5p. In this report, on-demand delivery was achieved using pH triggering in the acidic infarct zone, and miR-21-5p was delivered by the MSN/miR-21-5p complex in the second stage. The synergistic effect of anti-inflammatory and pro-vascular effects can effectively reduce myocardial infarct size in pigs [193], restore contractility of damaged myocardium, and significantly increase capillary density in the border zone, thereby significantly improving myocardial function [194]. In short, the gene therapy with the assistance of injectable hydrogels could also be favored.",
        "MI, resulting in massive myocardial cell death, adverse microenvironmental changes, loss of electrical communication in fibrotic scars, and inadequate blood supply to the infarcted myocardium, are three key aspects of MI treatment [195]. Lipid/plasmid DNA-eNOs (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) nanocomplexes were loaded into soft conductive hydrogels with equivalent myocardial conductivity and anti-fatigue properties. By co-encapsulation with ADSCs (adipose-derived stem cells) in vitro, the expression of NO was also significantly up-regulated by examining the enhanced NOx concentration in the medium after seven days, indicating gene transfection of ADSCs [196]. After the hydrogel was injected into the infarcted heart, QRT-PCR (quantitative real time polymerse chain reaction) showed that eNOs, VEGFA, Ang-1, Cx43, and Cdh-2 mRNA gene expressions were all up-regulated. The cardiac ejection fraction (EF) was significantly increased, the QRS interval was shortened, the infarct size was reduced, the fibrosis area was reduced, and the blood vessel density was increased, indicating a significant improvement in cardiac function (as shown in Figure 6).",
        "This conceptual study of combination therapy demonstrated a holistic approach to MI that enhances electrical communication to restore cardiac function, while ADSCs injected into hydrogels of infarcted myocardium alleviate the inflammatory environment, compensate for cell loss, and upregulate NO expression in myocardial tissue, with the ability to promote neovascularization and myocardial maturation.",
        "At present, hydrogel has made breakthrough progress in the treatment of myocardial infarction. As a substitute for myocardial infarction, the material itself not only has the potential of treating myocardial infarction, but also has great development potential in effective cell encapsulation, as well as bioactive factors, proteins, drugs, or genes delivery. However, the injection volume and time of injectable hydrogel, the concentration of loading factors and drugs, the matching of degradation rate and myocardial remodeling, and the physical and biological mechanisms of hydrogel for myocardial repair need to be further clarified.",
        "First of all, regarding the existing hydrogel treatment strategies, the injection amount of hydrogel in different treatment approaches and the injection time after MI need to be further studied, due to infarction area size differences in the clinical application. It is necessary to individualize infarction and injection amounts in order to achieve the optimal treatment effect. Furthermore, for the case of bioactive factor, drug, and gene loading, hydrogel injection time and the release of the load composition concentration should also be adapted to the corresponding pathologic stage. At present, most studies are limited to the effect of hydrogel injection at a single time on cardiac function, and there are few studies on the effect of injection time after MI. However, it has been proved that the time of hydrogel injection after myocardial infarction has a certain correlation with the efficacy [197,198], which is worth further study on this issue.",
        "Secondly, the pathological change of myocardial infarction is a progressive process, which gradually leads to ventricular remodeling. The degradation rate of hydrogel should match that of myocardial remodeling, and the degradation rate of hydrogel should be automatically degraded with myocardial remodeling. In this case, the degraded hydrogel should have sufficient mechanical force to continue to support the myocardial tissue. Recently, the EMH (elastin simulated hydrogel) loaded with SAB-PDA (salvianolic acid and polydopamine nanoparticles) solved the problem that the mechanical strength of hydrogel structure was reduced by the continuous exercise of myocardial tissue [199]. Under the up-regulation of TGase (glutamine transaminase) in myocardial tissue after myocardial infarction, SAB-PDA/EMH with higher mechanical strength can be formed, which makes the hydrogel material have better self-healing ability. More studies are also needed on how different hydrogel materials can be degraded while maintaining their mechanical properties. In addition, it is necessary to consider that the degraded fragments of hydrogel should not cause other adverse reactions in vivo, and the massive release of cells, drugs, and factors caused by degradation may also affect the treatment efficiency or produce side effects. Therefore, we also need to establish a more complete evaluation method for the efficacy and side effects of hydrogels in the treatment of myocardial infarction [200].",
        "Finally, MI is the physiological and pathological mechanism study upon hydrogel treatments after MI had revealed that hydrogel might reduce stress, influence the geometrical shape and thickness of the ventricular wall, and promote angiogenesis [201]. However, it is also worth mentioning that the interaction between this hydrogel formulation and the microenvironment of MI still lacks exploration [202,203].",
        "In short, the application of hydrogel in the treatment of MI has made significant progress in clinical research [204,205]. Based on this, different treatment strategies related to hydrogel will provide a variety of treatment means and approaches to serve patients. This review summarized a number of functional hydrogels in the treatment of MI, as well as various biological therapies combining cell, factor, protein, and drug-gene therapy for MI. Injectable hydrogel as a new biological material, although there is no precise and systematic study on the efficacy of various aspects, the satisfactory progress of hydrogel formulation in the field of myocardial tissue engineering will definitely bring better therapeutic effects for patients with MI. To achieve an optimal therapeutic effect, it might need to find the optimal injection time and load component concentration in the next few decades to explore the important mechanism of hydrogel in the direction of MI. Furthermore, the intelligent release of load components based on the myocardial microenvironment and better self-healing ability of hydrogel based on the dynamic process of myocardial continuous movement and ventricular remodeling will also be the future research direction. It is one of the key points of materials science and myocardial tissue engineering research to create a “cocktail therapy” with the optimal curative effect by rationally matching the modification of hydrogel, the combination of cells, growth factors, proteins, and drugs, in order to achieve a long-term curative effect.",

        "Skin is the body’s largest organ and the first line of defence against injury or infection [1]. Burn wounds are a primary cause of skin damage, which have significant negative impacts on the physical and mental health of patients, leading to reduced quality of life. Burns are considered a global health issue and account for 180,000 deaths annually [2]. In Australia alone, there were 5,430 hospitalisations for burns in 2013–14, constituting 1.2% of all injury-related cases during this time period [3]. The average cost of burns treatment for Australian patients is a staggering $71,056 [3], which may be increased by several fold depending on the severity of the burn. High threat to life cases alone prolong the standard 7 days of hospitalisation to 17 days, evidencing the huge socio-economic burden of burn wounds on both the patient and healthcare facilities [3]. Furthermore, burn wounds lead to poorer quality of life for the patient [4], as they cause a decline in physical functioning and may impact the capacity to work, body image, basic abilities and mental health of patients [5]. The loss of 15% of the total body surface area (TBSA) from burn injury is sufficient to be considered life-threatening [6, 7]. Burn wounds are also more complex to manage and treat when they occur in paediatric patients under 5 years, or elderly persons over 60 years of age [7].",
        "The complex structure and function of skin pose numerous challenges in regeneration after burn injury. The skin is composed of three distinct layers: the epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. The epidermis acts as the primary defence layer against organic elements and offers protection from the external environment. Thickness varies depending on the region of the body. The dermis is the second major layer of skin and is composed of collagen, elastin, electrolytes, and water. It also varies in thickness depending on location, ranging from 200 μm in the eyelids to 3 mm in the back. The hypodermis provides insulation from cold and violent trauma, and also acts to store energy [8]. Epidermal appendages consist of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands and eccrine glands [9]. Hair follicles are distributed all over the body except for the palms and soles, providing protection from ultraviolet radiation and preventing foreign material from entering the body. Sebaceous glands are found where hair is present and are responsible for sebum production and secretion to lubricate the skin. Apocrine glands are only found in certain areas of the body and their odourless secretion reacts with bacteria on the skin’s surface to produce body odour. Eccrine glands are present all over the skin’s surface and aid in retaining moisture and regulating body temperature, through the controlled release of sweat. In burn wounds, the inflicted damage leads to the death of skin cells and leaves the area susceptible to infection. Effective treatments for burn injury must first overcome the huge barrier of vascularisation, as failure to provide an adequate blood supply to the skin can result in necrosis, infection, sloughing or sepsis [6]. Epidermal appendages lost at the site of damage also typically fail to regenerate, leaving behind tissue scars from the poorly reconstituted collagen matrix [10].",
        "Current clinical practices for treating burn wounds include skin grafting, skin substitutes, and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). The standard treatment for burn wounds involves early excision of necrotic tissue followed by autologous skin grafting procedures [11]. However, the limited availability of autologous skin becomes an issue for patients with severe burn injuries [12]. This problem can be solved by repeated harvesting of the donor site, but the site must re-epithelialise within 2 to 3 weeks to reduce scarring [13]. Biological skin substitutes including amnion and cultured epithelial autografts (CEA) have proven effective in the treatment of burn wounds, although the presence of allogeneic products presents a risk of contamination and disease transmission [14]. Synthetic skin substitutes such as Biobrane® and Suprathel® have shown favourable results in accelerating healing time and reducing pain, but still pose risks of infection and hypertrophic scarring [15]. For NPWT, a clinical trial involving small-area, thermal paediatric burns showed that this expedited re-epithelialisation [16]. However, NPWT can be problematic for both patients and caregivers due to the physical burden, technical difficulties and mechanical issues. Hence, current clinical approaches are associated with numerous practical drawbacks for the patient, and also lack efficacy in the complete renewal of skin that has been compromised by burn wounds. These limitations call for the need to develop tissue engineered treatment methods.",
        "Tissue engineering approaches have become a significant area of interest for the treatment of burn wounds. Tissue engineered skin replacements have great potential for widespread applications in the field of wound healing, particularly to address the limited availability of autologous skin [17]. Recent advances include the exploration of strategies involving stem cells, biomaterials, and advanced manufacturing methods such as 3D printing to produce effective, alternative treatments. For instance, the role of adipose tissue-derived stem cell (AdSC) transplantation in skin repair has been demonstrated in a murine model [18], where enhanced tissue regeneration was evidenced by increased cell proliferation, a higher degree of neovascularisation, and up-regulation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) protein. Moreover, a variety of biomaterials have been investigated as scaffolds to support skin regeneration, such as silk fibroin [19], metal-doped calcium silicate [20], and polymeric hydrogel scaffolds [21]. These biomaterials have been shown to favour re-epithelialisation and angiogenesis, reduce the risk of post-injury infection, and possess excellent biocompatibility. Additionally, new methods have been developed to ‘print’ functional living skin, such as by using a biomimetic bio-ink and digital light processing-based 3D printing technology [22]. This approach was shown to promote efficient neovascularisation by mimicking the structure of natural skin, which induced dermal regeneration in a large animal model. Furthermore, Integra [23], a widely recognised dermal replacement technology worldwide, provides a scaffold for endogenous cell ingrowth and dermal stroma synthesis following healing. Integra has been used clinically as a skin substitute [24], and shown to reduce wound surface area and accelerate healing [25]. However, a major challenge lies in its susceptibility to infection, caused by the collection of haematomas and seromas beneath the artificial skin substitute [26].",
        "Currently, stem cells used for skin tissue engineering are in preclinical testing stages, with experimental studies only starting to emerge from 2010. Stem cells can provide critical benefits to tissue engineered burns treatment by stimulating direct differentiation into skin tissue structures, and interacting with nearby cells to create a more inducive environment for regeneration. The therapeutic potential of stem cells arises from their ability to secrete regenerative cytokines, making them an attractive choice for treating chronic wounds [27]. In preclinical treatments of burn wound models, inclusion of stem cells has resulted in better wound healing by inducing improved granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, healing speed, wound appearance, amount of scarring, presence of adnexal structures, regulation of inflammatory markers, and formation of vascular structures in the epidermal layer as well as its thickness and structure. By far the most popular type of stem cell being used in preclinical studies of burn wound repair are mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), commonly harvested from adipose tissue, bone marrow, and umbilical cord. MSCs play an important role in skin homeostasis and damage repair by promoting immune regulation, monitoring resident stem cells, and secreting growth factors to drive epithelialisation and neovascularisation [28, 29]. Other types of adult stem cells have proven to be useful for skin repair, such as those derived from hair follicle, dental pulp, and kidney. Pluripotent stem cells have also been used, but may raise several issues. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and foetal stem cells (FSCs) are associated with moral concerns and substantial legal restrictions, slowing down their applications in clinical wound healing [30, 31]. These and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are also prone to teratoma formation due to their pluripotency depending on the efficiency of the differentiation protocol, raising potential safety concerns [32]. Hence, ESCs, FSCs and iPSCs have not been included in our analysis due to their current limitations in being used for clinical applications. In vitro studies have also been excluded, since studies involving animal models are more closely representative of the clinical performance of new burns treatment strategies.",
        "The vast majority of studies using a stem cell-based approach for treating burn wounds are at the preclinical testing stage, and vary widely in their methods and outcomes. Over the past three years, only a few reviews have discussed tissue engineering methods for skin repair, with a primary focus on biomaterials [33], murine models [34], pluripotent stem cells [32], or immunomodulation [31] and other signalling pathways [30]. This review will cover the latest advances in tissue engineered solutions involving adult stem cells, tested in a variety of preclinical models. It will inform researchers and clinicians on the current progress in developing an ideal stem cell-based treatment for burn wounds, reflecting on a range of aspects including the type and source of stem cell, type of scaffold/matrix, animal model, graft type, type of wound injury, timeframe of treatment and analysis, and any proposed mechanisms.",
        "Selection of studies in this review was performed using the PRISMA scoping review protocol and checklist [35]. A comprehensive search of the electronic databases Embase, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted for studies published since 1 January 2009, on using stem cell-based tissue engineering approaches to treat burn wounds in preclinical animal models. Specific search strategies used for each database are presented in the Supplementary Information.",

        "Burn wounds can have severe impacts on quality of life, and current clinical treatments still face many challenges in restoring skin that is anatomically and functionally similar to native tissue, particularly for complex scenarios such as full-thickness or large area burns. Tissue engineering strategies incorporating stem cells have recently opened new doors for the effective treatment of burn wounds. Studies in preclinical models over the last 10 years, captured in this review, demonstrate substantial progress and highlight the prospect of stem cell-based tissue engineered skin constructs becoming a reality in the treatment of clinical burn injuries. In this section, we offer critical insights into different aspects of information reflected in the included studies, providing the latest updates in this exciting field of research.",
        "In our analysis, rats were the most commonly used animal model for burn wound treatment, followed very closely by mice. The primary advantages for using rats in burns studies are their availability and cost-effectiveness [37]. Rats also share several physiological similarities with humans, the most relevant being that rat skin is composed of the dermis and epidermis [38]. However, the primary wound healing method in rats is wound contraction, instead of re-epithelisation in humans [37]. The reduced healing time in rats allows researchers to study wound healing mechanisms more rapidly and efficiently. However, rapid healing times and even spontaneous healing can also prevent the risk of sepsis or immunosuppression that are generally seen in larger animal models, reducing the relevance of rats as a model for predicting the outcome of clinical burn wound treatment. Likewise, although mouse models mimic many aspects of human responses to burn injury, there are substantial differences that need to be considered [39]. Dermal and epidermal thickness, scar formation and glucose metabolism post-burn injury differ greatly between mice and humans. Thus, although small animal models confer economic advantages, have rapid reproduction rates, and reduce the time required for study, they have limited translational relevance to humans.",
        "Three of the included studies used pigs as a burn wound model, which have great anatomical and physiological similarity to humans, including in skin structure and response to therapeutics, dermal physiology, transdermal toxicology, wound healing, and neurophysiology [40]. Both humans and pigs have a thick epidermis, 50–120 μm in humans and 30–140 μm in pigs [40, 41]. In contrast to small and loose-skinned animals such as rodents, pigs and humans do not possess a panniculus carnosus, meaning that both species have a similar distribution of skin blood vessels. Both species also have sparse body hair, which is important since hair follicles impact the process of re-epithelisation. Due to the larger size of pigs, multiple treatments can be compared within the same animal, which reduces inter-individual variability [42]. However, this is not applicable for treatments which induce systemic effects. While porcine models are an optimal choice from a physiological perspective, they have higher costs and special housing requirements, as well as increased ethical concerns over their use [43].",
        "Stem cells used in the included studies were harvested from a variety of sources including adipose tissue, bone marrow, umbilical cord, hair follicle, and dental pulp. These sources differed with respect to their ease of access and feasibility of use in treating burn wounds.",
        "Conventional bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) have limited availability compared to some other sources such as adipose tissue, but treatments utilising BM-MSCs show potential to enhance skin regeneration, for example, by allowing the formation of a thicker epidermal layer and increased cell proliferation, collagen synthesis, and angiogenesis [44]. When obtaining BM-MSCs, aspiration volume directly correlates with cellular yield. Lower aspiration volumes of 10 and 20 mL have been shown to contain a lower concentration of nucleated cells and yield a lower number of MSCs [45]. In comparison, adipose tissue has been considered a more attractive source for harvesting stem cells, since subcutaneous adipose tissue can be easily accessed and repeatedly sampled, and the enzyme-based isolation procedures are not complicated [46]. The greatest advantage is the high quantity of cells that can be isolated, for instance, it is possible to obtain up to 3.5 million AdSCs from 1 g of adipose tissue [47]. However, although using liposuction as a standard procedure to collect adipose tissue is relatively safe and has minimal discomfort for the patient, this harvesting method may negatively affect the amount and viability of isolated AdSCs. The umbilical cord presents a reliable, accessible, and non-controversial source of stem cells. Applying umbilical cord-derived stem cells in burn wound models has been found to thicken the epidermis, increase the amount of dermal ridges, and create a better alignment of collagen fibres, demonstrating their active participation in skin wound healing through regenerative processes [48]. A novel method of isolating these stem cells involves cryopreserving cells from fresh umbilical cord post-delivery, in autologous cord plasma, to effectively reduce the risk of prion or virus contamination [49]. However, unlike for bone marrow and adipose tissue, ready access to umbilical cord as a stem cell source is more limited. While these are the predominant sources of stem cells considered for treating burn wounds, less utilised sources such as hair follicles and dental pulp also have useful attributes.",
        "Hair follicle stem cells (HSFCs) are involved in the formation of new hair follicles, epithelisation of wounds, and promotion of vascularisation in newly formed skin [50]. Although their original purpose is hair regeneration in response to skin injury, HFSCs are recruited at the site of a burn injury to differentiate into cells that assist in repairing the damaged epithelium [51]. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) modulating localised inflammation help to promote HFSC differentiation, thereby contributing to skin-barrier regeneration. HFSCs also have multiple advantages including their abundant source, easy sampling and low tissue damage during the sampling procedure, high proliferative capacity and differentiation potential, and the blatant lack of ethical issues [50]. On the other hand, dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) have potential as a stem cell source as they have been shown to generate mineralised tissue and extracellular matrix in xenograft models [52]. Current isolation methods for DPSCs include the explant method and the enzymatic digestion of pulp tissue method, but these techniques still need to be improved to achieve optimal proliferative capacity of cells, karyotypic stability, and clinal translatability. DPSCs can be implanted in chitosan, collagen or composite biomaterial scaffolds to induce tissue regeneration, and have shown positive results in regenerating periodontal tissue and skin lesions caused by burns. Their regenerative capacity in a burn wound repair model has been suggested to match stem cells derived from bone marrow and adipose tissue [53].",
        "MSCs were the most common type of stem cells used in the included studies. They are a heterogeneous population that commonly refer to adult stem cells capable of differentiating into connective tissues including bone, muscle, cartilage, and fat [54]. MSCs are a popular choice for use in skin tissue regeneration due to a range of beneficial properties, and were the most commonly chosen stem cell type among the included studies in this review. They can be harvested from a wide variety of tissues such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, and even menstrual blood. The main beneficial functions of MSCs in the context of skin repair include anti-inflammatory and immune-modulation effects [55–57], angiogenesis [58], and promotion of cell proliferation [59].",
        "MSCs are known to migrate to wound sites, differentiate, and regenerate lost tissue by regulating cellular responses to injury through paracrine signalling [60]. Experimental studies have shown that MSCs can coordinate inflammatory responses following tissue injury. For instance, MSCs secrete multiple inflammatory modulators including nitric oxide (NO), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin(IL)-10 and TNF-alpha-stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) [61]. MSCs can also facilitate wound healing by increasing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, which results in reduced levels of inflammatory IL-6 and IL-8, as well as decreased collagen production and hence reduced fibrosis [62]. Other beneficial interactions of MSCs include promoting the production of anti-inflammatory IL-35, PGE2 which reduces natural killer cell proliferation and T-cell migration, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which promotes angiogenesis, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) which is involved in downregulating fibrosis and increasing cell recruitment in the wound bed [62]. MSCs can also influence wound healing by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ [63]. In the remodelling phase of wound healing, MSCs produce transforming growth factor (TGF)-β3 and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), as well as regulate the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and collagen deposition [60, 64, 65].",
        "The anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties of MSCs make allogeneic transplantation possible [66]. Allogeneic human MSCs and some xenogeneic MSCs can avoid acute immune rejection through the expression of factor H and other complementary proteins [67]. They possess the ability to block neutrophil function by supressing the oxidative bursts of both resting and activated neutrophils, while simultaneously preserving neutrophil phagocytic chemotactic functions. Cytokines expressed by MSCs have been shown to play a critical role in immune-modulation mechanisms [68]. Quiescent MSCs mainly produce the immune-regulatory cytokines TGF-β and IL-10, whereby TGF-β inhibits IL‐2, major histocompatibility complex II (MHC‐II), and co‐stimulatory factor expression in dendritic cells (DCs) and T-cells, while IL-10 inhibits antigen-presenting cell maturation and suppresses T helper 17 cell (Th17) generation [68].",
        "MSCs also produce a wealth of bioactive trophic factors, which simulate adjacent parenchymal cells to kick-start the process of repairing damaged tissue [69]. In wound repair, MSCs play an important role in promoting angiogenesis, a complex process controlled by both pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. The ability of MSCs to mediate angiogenesis has been shown in a study where BM-MSCs engrafted in a skin wound released pro-angiogenic factors [70]. Human AdSCs have also been shown to secrete growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), VEGF, and TGF-β, which are directly involved in angiogenesis and wound healing, and resulted in increased microvessel formation in a murine burn model [71]. A study using the porcine model also confirmed that AdSC delivery can accelerate angiogenesis in a dose dependent manner in deep partial thickness burns [72].",
        "MSCs play a primary role in promoting cell proliferation and enhancing overall tissue repair. Cell cycle analysis and anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining in a rat skin expansion model showed that AdSC-treated injuries had significantly higher percentages of cell proliferation compared to fibroblast-treated injuries [18]. The proliferating cells were predominantly observed at the stratum basale and hair follicles. In another study using a rat skin wound model, regions treated with AdSCs showed increased rates of cell proliferation in granulation tissue. This was thought to be due to the influence of AdSCs on activated macrophages, which released significant amounts of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), a cytokine directly involved in the epithelial proliferation process [73]. The majority of studies included in this review observed that MSCs combined with a biomaterial scaffold have the capacity to accelerate wound healing, promote re-epithelisation, and induce skin tissue regeneration.",
        "Although an interesting point of investigation, only one of the include studies compared the effectiveness of using different doses of MSCs in wound healing, by incorporating them into a dermal regeneration template [74]. This porcine study used umbilical cord MSCs, and surprisingly found that a low dose range of 200–40,000 cells/cm2 stem cells was the most effective in regenerating full-thickness burn excised wounds. This was followed by a middle dose range of 2–4 × 105 cells/cm2, and lastly a high dose of 2 × 106 cells/cm2. The lower doses proved more effective in several aspects of skin repair, including accelerated wound healing, reduced scarring, and enhanced neovascularisation. Moreover, epidermal thickness was observed to be highest in the low dose group and decreased with increasing cell dose. These findings are potentially paradigm shifting among current beliefs in skin tissue regeneration, as previous studies hypothesised that a larger dose of stem cells was required to enhance skin healing [75–81]. To explain these findings, it was hypothesised that excessive amounts of transplanted stem cells might proliferate to the maximum capacity and consume all available resources, leading to possible nutrient deficiency and hypoxia in the wound environment that then catalysed cell death [74].",
        "MSCs cultured in 3D have the characteristics of enhanced differentiation capacity, upregulated pluripotency marker gene expression, and delayed replicative senescence [82]. Although there is no research to directly compare the effects of 2D versus 3D culture on burn wound healing, studies on other types of tissue regeneration show promising results. An in vitro study investigating the therapeutic effects of 3D spheroids formed from human MSCs for acute kidney injury showed that 3D culture enhanced the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins including collagen I, fibronectin and laminin, when compared to cells cultured in 2D [83]. The 3D spheroids also exhibited stronger anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties. When injected into the kidney of rat models, 3D cultured cells were more effective in protecting against apoptosis, reducing tissue damage, enhancing vascularisation, and improving overall renal function than 2D cultured cells. Another study examined the effects of human MSC secretome on corneal wound healing in rabbits [84]. Concentrations of bioactive factors such as HGF and ICAM-1 increased by up to five fold in the secretome produced by MSCs cultured on 3D fibre matrices compared to those on 2D culture dishes. The 3D cultured MSCs were effective at facilitating wound healing in corneal fibroblast cells and explanted corneas.",
        "3D bioprinting is a recent technological advance that can be used to produce 3D cellular or tissue structures, possessing the advantages of high resolution, flexible operation, repeatable printing, and high-throughput output, making it an appealing option for generating bioactive constructs for the clinical treatment of skin burns [85]. Since the first 3D bioprinting technology was reported, tissue engineering has made great progress in this realm, with the field now progressing towards printing mini-sized organs and tissues [86]. Using 3D bioprinting, different types of cells can be deposited at specific locations to form multilayer structures and build anatomically-similar tissues [87]. In an example where 3D bioprinting was applied in skin tissue engineering, a dermal-derived ECM (dECM) bioink was used to tackle the rapid degradation and high shrinkage seen in traditional collagen-based bioinks. The printed mixture of adipose tissue-derived MSCs and endothelial progenitor cells, together with skin-derived dECM was used to produce pre-vascularised skin grafts, which effectively accelerated skin healing in a mouse excisional wound model [88].",
        "All included studies except one used allogeneic or xenogeneic grafts. One study used isogeneic cells from genetically identical clones [89].",
        "Autologous skin grafts have remained the standard of care for clinical skin reconstruction and wound coverage, typically involving the use of split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs) and full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs). Although both have been known to provide good healing outcomes in patients, they are limited by certain drawbacks. STSGs have lower levels of elastin compared to FTSGs and are unable to regenerate full-thickness skin, often undergoing significant contraction following placement [90]. While STSGs can cover large wound areas on the recipient, a variety of donor site morbidities can occur including scarring, chronic pain, and infection [91]. FTSGs are more preferable for skin repair since they contain all skin layers as well as the regenerative appendages found in each cutaneous compartment [90]. However, FTSGs have a higher metabolic demand and are limited by the lack of donor skin, restricting their application to smaller wounds. Interestingly, a recently developed autologous homologous skin construct (AHSC) technology makes use of the patient’s innate skin regeneration potential to generate full-thickness skin, including all dermal and epidermal components [92]. In this case, a 10-year-old boy who suffered from a large upper torso burn wound was treated with STSGs and developed painful, functionally limiting scar contractions. As alternative treatment, a 17.5 cm2 section of skin was harvested from the groin and sent to be manufactured into AHSC at a biomedical facility. The skin construct was applied to a 200 cm2 wound immediately following excision. The AHSC displayed 100% graft take, as well as initial postoperative epithelialisation and re-pigmentation which progressed to complete epithelial coverage at 8 weeks. At 11 months, the regenerated skin restored range of movement and showed no adverse scarring, suggesting the potential of this technology in paediatric burn reconstruction.",
        "Allogeneic skin grafts catalyse potent immune responses involving both the innate and adaptive immune system, and their clinical applications need to rely heavily on effective immunosuppression in the recipient [93]. The immunocompromised state of patients with severe burn injuries receiving allogeneic skin grafts may result in delayed rejection, secondary infections, and increased scarring. In sandwich grafting for burn treatment, the skin allograft functions as a biological dressing that sits on top of a widely meshed autograft, to protect the wound bed in the interstices of the autograft [94]. Naturally, the allograft would separate from the wound bed due to gradual rejection, allowing the underlying autograft to complete the process of epithelisation. However, another major concern of using skin allografts is the risk of disease transmission. While the reported rates of disease transmission are sporadic and low, microbial testing is crucial to ensure the safety of the allografts.",
        "Xenogeneic materials such as porcine or fish skin can be used for temporary skin coverage, particularly in large scale or severe burns to stabilise the patient until they can be treated by autologous skin grafting [93]. Xenogeneic grafts contain antigens which are recognised by the immune system as foreign, which can lead to biochemical failure of the graft or even host organism death [95]. For clinical application, chemical treatments may be used that crosslink proteins within xenogeneic tissue, but this may not completely mask important antigens [93]. Although a recent Phase II clinical trial has suggested that a xenograft dressing could achieve re-epithelialization in burn wounds even without autologous split-thickness skin grafting [96], xenografts currently can only be considered a temporary solution for the clinical care of patients with severe burns.",
        "The types of preclinical burn models used in the included studies can be divided into thermal burn, radiation burn and surgical wound. Thermal burn was the most common injury used in animal models to test the effectiveness of tissue engineered constructs in burn wound healing. This is because thermal burns from fire, flames or scalds account for approximately 80% of all reported burns [97]. The metabolic response in burn patients following thermal injury is biphasic, with an initial ebb phase and then a hypermetabolic and catabolic flow phase [98]. The increased metabolic rate results from evaporative heat loss from the burn wound, as well as a central effect of inflammation on the hypothalamus. A study on the standardisation of thermal injuries in the rat model validated the same hypermetabolic response induced by thermal injury that is generally associated with severe burns [99]. Skin samples confirmed that animals receiving thermal burn wounds sustained skin injury across all layers, including complete epidermal destruction and thermal coagulative damage. Burned hair follicles also displayed distinct cellular damage and cytoplasmic swelling.",
        "Surgical wounds were the second most common injury type among the included studies. Surgical wounds are typically created under sterile conditions, and do not result in the same immediate pathophysiological effects seen in conventional burns. Therefore, although surgical skin wound models are more consistent and controlled, they are less representative of clinical burn pathology and responses to treatment due to inherent differences in physiological responses.",
        "Radiation burns are clinically far less common than thermal, electrical and chemical burns, with very different pathophysiological responses. Only 2 of the included studies used radiation burn in their animal models [100, 101]. Compared to thermal skin burns, radiation burns are characterised by necrosis, paroxysmal and chronic pain resistant to opiates, as well as uncontrolled, successive inflammatory waves [102]. Ulceration and necrosis may extend to deep dermal and underlying muscle structures, with the inflammatory waves inducing severe pain [103]. Furthermore, ionising radiation causes DNA damage which leads to repair responses, genetic mutations, or cell death, with early and late effects. Ultraviolet radiation resulting in ‘sunburn’ is one of the key inducing factors of squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma [104]. Excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation carries profound health risks including atrophy, pigmentary changes, skin wrinkling, and malignancy [105]. As such, radiation burn may not be a highly representative wound model for general burns treatment.",
        "The delay between establishing the skin wound in the preclinical model and applying the engineered skin product to the wound varied among the included studies, with some applying the tissue engineered product immediately post-burn, and others delaying the treatment for up to 10 days. Generally, studies involving burns patients showed that the best clinical outcomes were obtained when burns were excised and grafted at 24–48 h after the injury [106–108]. In preclinical models, treating burns outside of this optimal period using tissue engineered products may potentially reduce healing rates, although inter-species differences should also be taken into consideration when analysing the results.",
        "There was a large variation in the endpoints of outcome evaluation used in the included studies, ranging from 7 to 90 days post-burn. Some studies also had multiple endpoints at which biopsies were taken or animals were euthanised. The normal wound healing process occurs in three phases: haemostasis and the inflammatory phase (from the time of injury to day 4–6), the proliferative phase (day 4 to 14), and finally maturation and remodelling (day 8 to 1 year or longer) [60, 109]. Studies where endpoints do not extend beyond the proliferative phase of wound healing would not allow the full effects of wound maturation and remodelling to be assessed, and therefore may not be indicative of long-term healing response. Endpoints of 1 year or longer in preclinical models would obviously be ideal, particularly for larger animals due to their longer lifespan, but this is often difficult to implement due to housing requirements and increased costs. Interestingly, despite size differences, there were no major variations in the time period required for the start of wound recovery between small and large animals, with the vast majority of included studies reporting that wound filling with granulation tissue occurred between 7 to 21 days, and only one porcine study reporting 28 days.",
        "Biomaterials used for tissue regeneration can be generally divided into natural and synthetic biomaterials [110]. Natural biomaterials derived from biological and plant sources have been widely studied in tissue engineering because of their biocompatibility, bioactivity, and biodegradation properties, many of which possess similar structure to natural ECM. When placed in biological systems, natural biomaterials release products during biodegradation that have minimal cytotoxicity, and provide biomimetic properties to support cell adhesion and function [110]. Collagen, chitosan, and fibrin are some common examples of natural biomaterials used by studies included in this review, and are derived from protein and polysaccharide sources [111].",
        "Collagen is a naturally occurring protein and an ubiquitous component of the skin ECM, which is commonly used as a scaffold material due to its mechanical and cell-adhesive properties [112]. Although collagen scaffolds can undergo fast biodegradation and also result in wound contraction [113], this can be mitigated by crosslinking [114]. Chitosan is a natural polymer derived from chitin. It is a popular material choice for skin regeneration scaffolds since it has good biocompatibility with skin cells, is anti-microbial, promotes wound healing, and reduces scar formation [115]. 3D chitosan nanofibrillar scaffolds produced by electrospinning showed great ability to promote skin repair both in vitro and in a mouse model [116]. However, applications of pure chitosan are often limited by low mechanical durability [117]. When combined together, collagen/chitosan scaffolds have shown the ability to promote keratinocyte migration and wound re-epithelisation in an ex vivo human skin wound model [118], as well as cutaneous wound healing in murine models when combined with BM-MSCs [119, 120]. Scaffolds with this material combination can have many advantages for skin repair such as mechanical stability, antibacterial function, and accelerated collagen synthesis through fibroblast recruitment, diluting the drawbacks of the individual materials.",
        "Fibrin is another versatile biopolymer that can be used as a scaffold for skin regeneration. It can improve skin graft success rates, support keratinocyte and fibroblast growth [121], and convey better angiogenic properties than collagen scaffolds [112]. However, fibrin hydrogels used in skin tissue engineering also exhibit several limitations: gel shrinkage during the formation of flat sheets, low mechanical stiffness, and rapid biodegradation before the formation of vital tissue structures [121]. The usefulness of fibrin hydrogels can be extended by incorporating ECM-derived proteins to improve their biological activity, such as fibronectin, vitronectin and laminin. Injectable fibrin scaffolds that slowly release a cocktail of growth factors including PDGF, VEGF, TGF-β1, IGF, FGF, and EGF can promote skin healing through cell proliferation, collagen deposition, and tissue revascularisation [122].",
        "Composite scaffolds can combine the advantages of several biomaterials to enhance skin regeneration, and compensate for the limitations of individual materials. One of the included studies seeded MSCs onto a biodegradable hybrid hydrogel synthesised from unsaturated arginine-based poly(ester amide) and chitosan derivative [123]. These MSC-seeded hybrid gels promoted wound closure, re-epithelialisation, granulation tissue formation, and vascularisation of third degree burns in mice. They also increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 expression and M2-like macrophages, and reduced inflammatory TNF-α expression and M1-like macrophages. While the hydrogels alone were seen to promote vascularisation, they were much more effective when seeded with MSCs. In other studies, 3D printing has been used to fabricate composite scaffolds with new material combinations for skin repair, such as a gelatine-sulfonated silk composite scaffold to overcome the deficiency of dermal vascularisation [124]. As a collagen derivative, gelatine possesses great biocompatibility and fast degradation rate, which exhibits enhanced mechanical support when combined with sulfonated silk. This 3D printed scaffold was shown to promote the regeneration of skin-like tissues in a rat skin defect model.",
        "Another interesting but less commonly explored natural biomaterial for skin repair is the acellular amniotic membrane, obtained from the placenta following caesarean section delivery, conveying excellent biocompatibility as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects [125]. The amniotic membrane includes amniotic mesenchymal cells (AMCs) and amniotic epithelial cells (AECs). AMCs are capable of differentiating into all three germ layers and secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines such as PGE2, IDO, HGF and TGF-β [126]. AECs have been shown to express HLA-G antigens on their surface, which are involved in the induction of immune tolerance and can effectively reduce the risk of post-transplantation rejection [126].",
        "Synthetic polymers are also used as scaffold materials for skin regeneration as they eliminate the risk of disease transmission, and their fabrication processes can be more precisely controlled to give tailorable mechanical and chemical properties. However, most synthetic polymers lack bioactivity unless further modified [127]. An example is poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), which has good biocompatibility and also exhibits potential as a protein delivery system [127]. Modified PVA hydrogels were shown to be biocompatible and not elicit severe inflammatory responses for up to 12 weeks after in vivo implantation in mice. Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) is another commonly used synthetic polymer in skin tissue engineering [128]. PEG-based amphiphilic copolymers have versatile uses as scaffold materials, where the hydrophobic polyester components provide biodegradation and protein adhesion, while the hydrophilic PEG blocks provide better mechanical properties and elasticity [129].",
        "Other substances have been added to tissue engineered constructs involving stem cells in combination with scaffolds to improve their bioactivity and functional characteristics for skin repair in the included studies. Other cell types added in combination with stem cells can include dermal papilla cells, dermal fibroblasts, and keratinocytes [130]. Dermal papilla cells are mesenchymal cells found in the skin which regulate hair follicle growth and development [131]. Dermal fibroblasts are extensively involved in the natural wound healing process, particularly during the proliferative phase by performing collagen synthesis and contraction. Fibroblast proliferation can be induced by a variety of growth factors including PDGF, IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF-α [109]. Keratinocytes migrate, proliferate and differentiate into the epidermis during wound healing, and also promote angiogenesis by secreting VEGF [109].",
        "A range of bioactive substances have been added to tissue engineered constructs in the included studies, including spirulina biomass, hematoporphyrin, and the PDGF-B gene. Spirulina is a blue-green microalgae that has been shown to aid skin wound healing by promoting angiogenesis, immune cell infiltration, epithelialisation, ECM deposition, and wound contraction [132], as well as by enhancing fibroblast viability and anti-oxidative mechanisms [133]. Hematoporphyrin is a photosensitiser that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), providing anti-microbial effects while promoting cell proliferation, and regulating inflammatory factors and collagen remodelling [134]. PDGF-B is a growth factor that recruits pericytes essential for the stabilisation and maturation of vascular structures [135]. PDGF is produced by several cell types, including macrophages, monocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells, which can then result in chemotaxis [109]. In skin repair, PDGF-B acts as a chemical inducer that can catalyse repair cells to migrate from the wound edge to the wound bed [136], as well as stimulate the proliferation of repair cells to increase the formation of granulation tissue [137]. In addition to these, VEGF is a common pro-angiogenic factor utilised in skin repair to accelerate the early phases of wound healing by promoting neovascularisation [138]. EGF is another commonly used growth factor recognised for its therapeutic functions in stimulating skin cell growth, proliferation and differentiation [139].",
        "While stem cells have attracted significant attention in skin tissue engineering due to their ability to differentiate into tissue-specific cells and/or secrete bioactive factors to aid repair, several hurdles need to be overcome before stem cell-based products can become a standard method in clinical burns treatment. A primary hurdle in the translation of stem cell-based tissue engineered skin arises from the inherent discrepancies in skin structure and physiological response between humans and animal models [37]. For instance, murine models cannot fully replicate the pathophysiological and systemic responses to burns that humans demonstrate, which reduces the translational relevance of products tested using such models. While porcine models provide a better prediction of clinical treatment outcomes, the majority of current studies are limited in scope due to practical constraints such as housing requirements, cost, and ethics. For these reasons, the generation of in vitro skin organoids may bridge a gap between animal models and clinical response to treatment. For instance, skin organoids have been generated in 3D culture using a homogenous population of mouse pluripotent stem cells, which replicated some of the characteristics of native skin including the development of new hair follicles [140]. The same group then developed a human skin organoid, by guiding human iPSCs through a month-long process of differentiation to generate complex hair-bearing human skin tissue [141]. These skin organoids may be used to model burn wounds for testing new skin substitutes, offering short modelling times and the potential to be made patient-specific [142].",
        "Recent developments in biofabrication technologies such as 3D bioprinting are enabling the production of anatomically-similar skin constructs, which can replicate the essential features and native functions of human skin, and be used either as a test model for new skin substitutes or developed as a therapeutic product. 3D bioprinting provides the advantages of reproducibility and customisability, allowing for accurate cell positioning and control in preparing biomimetic tissue structures [143]. Using 3D bioprinting with a medical grade bioink and mechanically extracted human skin cells, a dermis could be reconstituted in vitro, and skin cellular components could also be printed directly onto an in vivo skin wound [144]. Experiments in a murine model suggested that this technology was feasible and well-tolerated, with potential for development into a clinical treatment for patients with severe burns through a single intraoperative step. In another approach, a collagen and alginate bioink in combination with keratinocytes and fibroblasts were printed in a 3D scaffold, where cells were shown to form dense structures similar to human skin as they could migrate and proliferate on the scaffold [143]. The use of additive manufacturing in skin tissue engineering could improve standardisation and reproducibility of patient outcomes, and assist the translation of new therapeutic products into clinical applications.",
        "The development of new biomaterials could further augment the formation of biomimetic skin constructs, potentially progressing towards full-thickness skin regeneration. For example, antibiotic-based silk fibroin (ABSF) films can accelerate burn wound healing by increasing fibroblast viability and adhesion, as well as by reducing the chance of infection at the wound site [145]. Additionally, a dextran-based hydrogel was found to stimulate neovascularisation within the first week of application when used to treat third degree burns in a pig model, resulting in rapid healing and wound closure, increased re-epithelisation and ECM remodelling, and superior reinnervation of newly formed skin tissue compared to conventional dressing treatment [146].",
        "Future directions for using stem cells in burns treatment could involve not only the direct use of cells themselves, but also their secretory products such as extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes (small EVs) and microvesicles (large EVs). The emerging role of EVs both as disease biomarkers and therapeutic agents is being increasingly recognised, as they have been identified to play key roles in intercellular communication [147, 148]. Stem cell-derived EVs have been shown to replicate the pro-regenerative functions of their parent cells, such as promoting cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and supressing apoptosis [148], pointing to their potential in being used as novel therapeutics for skin repair and burns treatment [149], possibly obviating the need to use cells and navigate associated practical hurdles. EVs from human iPSCs and MSCs are considered to have a key role in paracrine signalling, and can enhance healing in burn wounds without the associated stem cells [150]. For instance, EVs from iPSC-derived MSCs have been shown to enhance the migration of human dermal fibroblasts to stimulate vascularisation, effectively promoting wound healing by reducing scarring and improving collagen maturity [151]. In mouse model of a second degree burn, iPSC-derived EVs played a significant role in enhancing skin re-epithelisation and increasing numbers of keratinocytes [152]. MSC-derived EVs have similarly been reported to promote skin regeneration and accelerate would healing [147]. Part of the mechanisms leading to these effects may be related to the immunomodulatory properties of the parent MSCs, whereby their ability to promote anti-inflammatory M2 microphage polarisation, aid B-cell regulation, and suppress effector T-cells are replicated in the MSC-derived EVs [153, 154].",
        "Nanotechnological approaches are now being increasingly explored to provide innovative tissue engineering solutions for treating burn wounds. Nanoparticles could be used for temporary or sustained controlled delivery of growth factors [155]. For instance, a nanofibrous skin substitute was created using electrospinning to allow programmable release of multiple angiogenic growth factors through gelatine nanoparticles [156]. This construct was designed to deliver endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor in the early stage of wound healing to accelerate epithelisation and vascular sprouting, while PDGF and VEBF are released in the later stages to induce blood vessel maturation. Moreover, micro-/nano-robots are being increasingly explored as an exciting new field to provide targeted drug delivery that can be controlled by external sources such as magnetic forces, light, or ultrasound [157]. These could be used to deliver a range of cargo from genes and biomacromolecules to cells, and might find new applications in bioengineered skin constructs.",
        "Nanosensors are another exciting area of development that could be integrated into tissue engineering solutions for real-time monitoring of skin repair, using biomarkers generated during the process of wound healing. For instance, novel fluorescent magnesium hydroxide nanosheets have been integrated with electrospun fibres and agarose gels to create multifunctional topical wound dressings [158]. The nanosheets provided the dressing with potent antimicrobial properties, with a strong fluorescence signature that could be used to assess the dressing degradation and functional antimicrobial capacity. Moreover, pH-responsive changes in fluorescence could act as a probe for wound acidification as an indicator of healthy wound healing. Such approaches could be considered for developing new skin wound dressings with biosensing capabilities.",
        "Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is rapidly evolving field. From our discussions in this review, it is evident that the use of stem cell-based tissue engineering approaches, augmented by biomaterials to assist skin repair in preclinical models of burn wounds has demonstrated promising outcomes, whereby full-thickness burns have been regenerated together with accessory structures such as hair follicles [50] in some cases. Nevertheless, further studies need to be conducted to test the safety and efficacy of these methods, and address possible variations associated with donors or treatment procedures before stem cell-based tissue engineered skin can be implemented for clinical burns treatment in human patients. This can be conducted through the optimisation of parameters, including those assessed in this review – cell types and tissue sources, cell dosage, supporting biomaterials, and treatment timeframe. Improved reporting would also help with standardisation of results from preclinical studies, particularly on quantitative data such as the thickness of newly formed skin and incidence of complications, which were rarely specified in the studies included in this review. Furthermore, as treatment responses in animal models do not directly translate to humans, it is vital that more physiologically relevant preclinical models are used to assess new therapies, or that new technologies are used to create in vitro representations of human tissue to aid proof of concept studies. By combining cross-disciplinary advances in regenerative medicine, incorporating stem cells, new biomaterials, manufacturing techniques, and nanotechnological advances, tissue engineered skin will move closer to becoming a reality for the clinical treatment of full-thickness burns.",

        "Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) have emerged as promising approaches to address the limitations of conventional treatments for tissue and organ damage, offering new therapeutic techniques that have revolutionized the field of biomedical research [1,2,3]. TERM involves the integration of cells, biomaterials, and bioactive molecules to synthesize a network of biologically functional tissue substitutes or to stimulate the body’s natural regenerative processes [4]. Currently, TERM is a relatively novel field with many avenues left to explore. One avenue of particular interest is appropriate biomaterial scaffold selection [5,6]. Biomaterial scaffolds serve to contain, protect, and transport cells and their necessary bioactive molecules and essential nutrients [7]. The scaffold should ideally mimic the specific native tissue microenvironment for the cell of interest, conducive to their proliferation, differentiation, migration, reorganization, and survivability [8,9]. Thus, the selection of an appropriate biomaterial involves careful consideration of the material’s biological, mechanical, and physiochemical properties, including but not limited to the availability of attachment substrates for cells, diffusion capability, biocompatibility, degradation rate, stiffness, tuneability, and cost [10,11,12,13].",
        "Traditional biomaterials used range from ceramics, synthetic and natural polymers, metals and alloys, or even in varying combinations, all of which will offer distinct advantages and disadvantages depending on the desired characteristic and purpose [14,15]. In recent light, the chicken egg has garnered attention for its viability as a biomaterial for TERM research due to its vast advantages, including accessibility, affordability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and inherent bioactivity [16,17]. Moreover, there are fewer ethical concerns due to the fact that the commercially available eggs are mostly unfertilized [18,19,20].",
        "The four major layers of the chicken egg are the eggshell (ES), eggshell membrane (ESM), egg white (EW), and egg yolk (EY). These components collectively possess a rich array of proteins, minerals, and growth factors that contribute to unique physiochemical and biological properties [21,22]. Studies have shown that each component has the potential to be used as a biomaterial on its own; however, researchers can also extract, modify, and use each specific component in combination with other biomaterials to enhance bioactivity, mechanical strength, and/or provide controlled release capabilities [23,24].",
        "Despite the promising prospects of chicken-egg-based biomaterials, challenges and limitations exist. For instance, the variability in egg composition from egg-to-egg and batch-to-batch and potential allergenicity need to be carefully addressed. Moreover, the translation of egg-based biomaterials from preclinical studies to clinical applications requires a comprehensive understanding and optimization of their physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and long-term stability [21].",
        "To our knowledge, there is limited research connecting the basic introduction of the chicken egg and its chemical and biological properties to its application in tissue engineering. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of chicken eggs as a biomaterial for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine research. This paper will discuss the unique structure, composition, and biological properties of each chicken egg component and highlight their current state of research and applications. By describing the egg’s properties from the perspective of tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and as a biomaterial, providing specific examples of its applications, readers can gain insight into its vast innovative potential.",
        "The chicken egg consists of four main components: the eggshell, eggshell membrane (ESM), egg white (EW), and egg yolk (EY). Each component serves a unique purpose in protecting and supporting the developing embryo if fertilized [21].",
        "The most outer layer is the eggshell, which is a thin, hard, and brittle covering of approximately 0.3 mm in thickness, primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and phosphate. The shell serves to provide structural integrity and protect the inner components (yolk, white, and embryo) from mechanical impact, microbial contamination, and dehydration [25]. The ES is composed of three layers: the most outer surface (cuticle), a spongy (calcareous) layer, and an inner lamellar (mamillary layer). The spongy and inner lamellar layer together form a porous matrix of protein fibers and calcite crystal. This porous architecture (7000–17,000 pores per egg) allows for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and moisture to permeate into the egg. The outer cuticle layer is covered with mucin proteins, which effectively plug and seal the pores, physically keeping bacteria out. Furthermore, it has been shown that these proteins also exhibit antimicrobial activity [25,26]. Structurally, the chicken egg forms with two distinct poles: a blunted end and a pointed end [27]. The physiochemical properties of the two inner layers remain relatively consistent across batches of eggs and over time, with some minor variations; however, studies have shown that the quality of the cuticle layer changes depending on the hen’s age at the time of egg formation; decline in the quality of the cuticle layer increases the egg’s susceptibility to microbial invasion and physiochemical changes. [25]. Its rigid matrix and crystalline structures provide it with ideal properties for use in powder and/or microparticle form for bone regeneration [21].",
        "The next component is the ESM, which has several functions. The ESM is a thin fibrous protein network just beneath the ES. During egg development, it acts as the structural foundation for the formation and calcification of the shell. It also acts as an additional physical barrier to microbial invasion, supports the formation of enzymes and proteins, and compartmentalizes the egg white component, preventing it from the mineralizing processes that occur in the eggshell. Like the ES, the ESM is also composed of three distinct substructure layers: the most outer layer (outer shell membrane), the middle layer (inner shell membrane), and the most inner layer (limiting membrane) [18,28,29]. Between the outer shell membrane and inner shell membrane, an air cell can be found on the blunt end of the egg. Because the ES is porous, this is where gas exchange typically occurs. This air cell enlarges as the egg cools after being laid and also enlarges over time as the egg undergoes gas exchange and its water content evaporates. Due to its ability to act as a mesh foundation for ES formation and high protein content, ESM has reportedly been used as a whole membrane and in powdered form for bone, cartilage, skin, and vasculature regeneration studies [21].",
        "Below the ESM is the EW. EW is a clear gel-like component of the chicken egg. Like the ES and ESM, the EW component also serves as a physical barrier against bacteria infiltration. Additionally, several proteins in this component, such as conalbumin and lysozyme, have antibacterial properties [18]. The EW has two clear phases: an inner thick albumin and outer thin albumen. The thick albumen has a much more viscous property and forms a capsule directly around the EY and its membrane. Meanwhile, the thin albumin surrounds the thick albumin, closer to the ESM. The thin albumen has a higher water content and functions to provide moisture to the yolk and develop embryos if fertilized. Two opaque EW spiral filaments that extend from the polar ends of the EY and attach to the ES, called the chalazae, form part of the EW. These filaments suspend and maintain the EY in the center of the egg, providing stability and a protective mechanism against the inertia of external forces. Unlike the ES, the physiochemical properties of EW can vary greatly over time depending on various factors, including atmospheric temperature and storage duration. For example, studies have shown that the pH of EW ranges from 7.6 to 9.7. The pH initially increases rapidly after the egg is laid; it becomes more alkalotic over time, particularly with increased temperatures. However, after even longer incubation periods, the pH of the whites eventually decreases. This correlation is directly related to the diffusion of carbon dioxide out of the egg [30]. Other notable physiochemical properties of EW include its high water-holding capacity, foaming properties, emulsifying properties, and heat-induced gelation properties. These properties are attributed to its diverse protein composition (over 150 different proteins). However, its gel-like properties can be altered through changes in pH and temperature and the presence of salts [31,32]. Due to its unique properties, it is reportedly being used in powder and hydrogel form for TERM research [21].",
        "The most inner layer of the chicken egg is the EY, which is enclosed by a transparent proteinaceous membrane called the vitelline membrane. This membrane is also composed of three sublayers, which include an amorphous middle layer encapsulated between a more fibrous inner (perivitelline lamina) and outer layer (extravitelline lamina) [27,33]. This membrane functions as the final barrier against bacterial invasions and also functions to maintain the shape of the yolk and compartmentalize it from the white. Within the vitelline membrane is the EY itself—a pigmented homogenized fluid body that serves as a source of nutrients for the developing embryo (if fertilized). The EY has two distinct phases: one being a clear yellow aqueous phase (plasma), which contains a majority of the yolk’s lipids and soluble proteins, and the other being an insoluble phase (granules). Due to its high lipid contents, it has excellent gelation properties that can also be modified through temperature. The pH of the EY component is relatively more robust with changes in temperature and over time compared to EW and is reported to have a range of approximately 5.9 to 6.5 [30]. Various components of the EY have been isolated and used in gel or oil form [21] (Figure 1).",
        "The content of the chicken egg is capable of nurturing a chicken embryo; therefore, the egg contains all necessary nutrients and ideal composition to support cellular activity and biological growth. This diverse composition ultimately contributes to the egg’s unique structure, physicochemical properties, and biological activities [21,34]. The whole egg is mainly composed of water (74.4%), proteins (12.3%), and lipids (11.6%). It also contains small amounts of carbohydrates (1%), many minerals and trace elements (phosphorus, sodium, strontium, potassium, sulfur, iron, copper, silica, chlorine), essential amino acids, antioxidants, and every vitamin with the exception of vitamin C. However, it is important to note that variations in the composition exist and may vary depending on chicken strain, age, and environmental factors [33,35,36]. The average proportion of total egg weight of each component is as follows: ES (9%), ESM (<0.5%), EW (62%), and EY (29%) [33,36].",
        "The shell is composed of 95% inorganic minerals, 3.5% organic material, and 1.5% water. It has been reported that calcium carbonate makes up to 98.5% of the inorganic minerals. Other inorganic minerals found in the shell include calcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2), magnesium carbonate (MgCO3), and trace amounts of other ions including sodium, strontium, potassium, sulfur, and silica [18,21,33]. The organic aspect of the ES comes from the outer cuticle layer, which is composed of 90% glycoproteins, but also contains 4% carbohydrates, 3% lipids, and 3% hydroxyapatite crystals [37].",
        "The fibrous network of ESM is composed of 90% proteins, many of which resemble human extracellular matrix (ECM) such as collagen type I, collagen type V, collagen type X, glucosamine, proteoglycan, desmosine, keratin, hyaluronic acid, and sialic acid. The various collagen types represent approximately 10% of the total proteins. They also contain approximately 3% lipids and 2% carbohydrates. Of its composition, there are also bioactive and functional molecules including hyaluronic acid, amines, amides, and carboxylic acids [21].",
        "The EW makes up the majority of the total egg weight at approximately 62% and makes up 56% of the protein found in eggs. In addition to protein, the EW component also contains carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and water. The protein component is made up of more than 150 proteins. These proteins can be categorized as main proteins or minor proteins. Ovalbumin is a major protein that makes up 54% of the total EW proteins while other major proteins include ovotransferrin (12%), ovomucoid (11%), globulins (8%), ovomucin (3.5%), and lysozyme (3.5%) [21,33,38]. Some prominent minor proteins include ovoinhibitor (1.5%), ovoglycoprotein (1%), flavoprotein (0.8%), ovomacroglobulin (0.5%), cystatin (0.05%), and avidin (0.05%), which offer key biological activities (further discussed below).",
        "The innermost component of the chicken egg, the EY, has a mean total egg weight of 29%. EY is composed of 50% water, 30% lipids, 16% proteins, 4% carbohydrates, and various micronutrients including vitamins (A, B, D, E, K,) and essential minerals (calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, potassium, and sodium) [21,33]. The aqueous phase contains 90% of the EY’s total lipids, a majority of it being low-density lipids (LDLs), and approximately 50% of the EY’s total proteins. Conversely, the insoluble phase contains the remaining 10% lipids, mostly as high-density lipids (HDLs), and the other half of the EY’s total proteins. Some notable proteins found in the EY with biological activity include livetin, phosvitin, and immunoglobulins (further discussed below) [21,39].",
        "While the eggshell is often overlooked due to its relative lack of nutrients, it does have a place in regenerative medicine. For example, due to the presence of calcium phosphate, ES has been shown to have high bioactivity. It also possesses biodegradable properties, making it suitable for biomaterial research. Furthermore, the trace elements found in the ES have been shown to be capable of promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Evidently, studies have shown its use in bone tissue engineering research as it can serve as a biocompatible scaffold for osteogenesis, and cell attachment and proliferation [21]. In an in vitro study by Dadhich (2016), it was shown that naturally derived calcium phosphate from ES led to greater cellular activity and growth compared to synthetic calcium phosphate, suggesting that the unique composition of ES has great biological activity and potential uses in TERM research [40].",
        "Similar to the other components of the egg, the ESM also provides antibacterial, biodegradability, and biocompatibility properties. In an in vitro study, it has been suggested that the ESM is capable of binding and destroying bacterial cell membranes [41]. Furthermore, due to its high collagen composition, ESM resembles human ECM and thus has the ability to induce cellular adhesion, migration, and proliferation [21]. Though limited to mice studies, other biological activities of the ESM such as wound healing, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity have also been observed [41].",
        "EW has a wide variety of functions and biological properties because of its diverse functional protein profile. As with all components of the chicken egg, EW exhibits biocompatibility, biodegradability, and antibacterial properties. Ovalbumin, the most abundant protein in EW, plays a role in cell adhesion and attachment and has antioxidant properties [18]. Conalbumin, ovotransferrin, and lysozyme are three other major proteins of EW that also demonstrate antibacterial properties. It is noteworthy that lysozyme, among the other antibacterial proteins, demonstrates broad-spectrum antibacterial specificity, and can also moderate cells from malignant transformation [18,34]. Another major protein of EW is ovomucoid, which is highly significant as it is the primary source of egg allergies in humans [21]. Like ESM, EW has a resemblance to human ECM and thus exhibits ECM-like properties, which include adsorbing and modulating the diffusion of growth factors and other nutrients, acting as a substrate for cellular attachment, and protecting cells from enzymatic degradation. Numerous in vivo studies further demonstrate the wide range of biological activity that EW possesses, including improving cellular activity (viability, proliferation, migration, differentiation), inducing angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, and reducing inflammation [18,21].",
        "Due to the relatively higher lipid concentration in the EY compared to other egg components, the yolk exhibits some different biological activities. The most notable properties are its high anti-inflammatory, anti-neurodegenerative, and anti-atherosclerotic properties. Uniquely, the EY’s plasma phase resembles human blood as it is rich in various peptides, antibodies (namely immunoglobulin Y (IgY)), and nutrients [34,41]. Phosvitin, a key protein of the insoluble phase of EY, has a wide variety of biological activities. It has been reported to be capable of inducing osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, metal chelating, antioxidant properties, and antimicrobial properties. Together, the various EY molecules have demonstrated a wide range of other biological activities, including enhancing wound healing, analgesic effects, neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects, and immune modulation [21,33,34,42,43].",
        "Unlike other protein-based biomaterials, EW is usable in its raw form for different applications thanks to its antibacterial properties [44]. EW has inherent antibacterial properties due to the presence of lysozyme, which can disrupt β-1,4 linkages in the bacteria barrier of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [45]. Impressively, the EW’s antibacterial properties do not disappear in denatured forms; heat-denature at certain pH values and chemical-denatured treatments could even increase the hen EW lysozyme antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria [46,47].",
        "Aware of the excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial characteristics, researchers have utilized EW as a biomaterial in various applications, such as electro-spun fibers [44,48] and hydrogels [45,49,50,51] for wound healing, nanocomposites [52,53], and microfibers [47,54,55] for bone tissue engineering. As bacterial infections represent a major cause of the failure of medical implants and devices, coating material surfaces with lysozyme from EW could be considered a promising strategy [56].",
        "EW can be collected from fresh eggs purchased from stores [23,57,58,59] and farms [60], or it can be purchased in a processed form such as egg powder from various companies [47]. There are different ways to process EW into a hydrogel; one method is altering its physicochemical properties such as changing the pH or temperature [45,50,61]. Another method is to introduce crosslinkers into EW, like glutaraldehyde (GA) and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDE) [16,62]. A third method, which is the most popular, is mixing and crosslinking EW with other molecules such as alginate, gelatin, and chitosan to form a composite or hybrid gel (Table 1) [10,49,57].",
        "A water-insoluble EW hydrogel membrane was developed by Dong et al., which has applicable mechanical properties, softness, and elasticity [63]. The fabrication included a unique technology, unidirectional dehydration, where a film with nanopores is applied to allow the directional movement of water molecules from EW because of gravity [63,64]. The condensed EW proteins were then transformed into an organized structure and formed an EW hydrogel membrane with a heat treatment.",
        "Without toxic chemicals involved, Ovomucin (OVN) could be isolated from raw EW using isoelectric precipitation method by altering the pH and ion strength [65,66]. OVN could be potentially used for creating desired pore sizes and increasing porosity in tissue engineering, given its excellent foaming property [67].",
        "Luo et al. compared ovalbumin hydrogels crosslinked by three different crosslinkers: glutaraldehyde (GA), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDAC), and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDE). As revealed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, various pore sizes and porosities were found in ovalbumin hydrogels with these crosslinkers. The BDE-crosslinked scaffold had the most uniform pore size distribution and a relatively narrow pore size range (50–160 mm). Only small pores could be seen on the surface of the GA-crosslinked scaffold, but its cross-sectional area pore size was found to be relatively uniform (20–180 mm). The EDAC-crosslinked scaffold had the most porous structure and the largest pore sizes (40–300 mm). Controllable pore sizes and porosity allow ovalbumin hydrogels to meet more needs of biomaterials and could potentially be applied to a larger range of biomedical applications.",
        "Apart from synthetic materials, natural polymers have also been utilized to modify the mechanical properties of ovalbumin hydrogel. For example, flavonoids are able to promote the gelation of ovalbumin solutions, improving its strength and elasticity [68]. Another research group added gelatin to stabilize the OVN hydrogel for high porosity and implantability [65]. With an increase in OVN concentration, cell functions were improved, and more organized cytoskeletons were found in cells cultured on the scaffolds. In animal tests, a limited inflammatory response was found after implantation, indicating that it is a desirable candidate for various biomedical applications [65].",
        "Zhao et al. generated hydroxypropyl chitosan–EW hydrogel (HPCS–EWH) with excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial properties. Moreover, as a hydrogel pad, it has desirable self-healing efficiency and mechanical strength, preventing deformation, damage, and cracking during its service life [49]. Furthermore, the HPCS–EWH provided a distinguished effect in promoting the healing of burn wounds regarding re-epithelialization, formation of granulation tissue, and tissue remodeling.",
        "Chang and their colleagues developed a hydrogel with EW that has excellent stretchability, direct-writing 3D printability, and self-healing, without losing inherent bioactive elements [23,45]. Their hydrogel methodology combined two ways for EW gelation: alkalization and ionic crosslinking. In alkalization, carboxyl groups (-COOH) in EW proteins are deprotonated to -COO, and electrostatic repulsion becomes dominant, causing the breakdown of the original balance, followed by the reorganization of the protein chains and the formation of a solid hydrogel [69]. Later, they soaked the hydrogel in a culture medium with multivalent ions, such as Na+ and Ca2+, to establish a secondary network of ionic bonds. With ion crosslinking, the Young’s modulus of the hydrogel increased by 2.5-fold, and the pore size shrunk dramatically [45].",
        "Unlike most bio-inks used for 3D printing that require gelatinization as soon as possible after printing to retain their shape and avoid fusion caused by gravity, this EW hydrogel could be directly written as 3D architecture [23]. Adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH) induces protein denaturation within the EW bio-ink, forming new bonds such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between protein chains. These dynamic bonds contribute to the shear thinning property, which is essential for successful direct ink writing. In direct ink writing, a bio-ink with the shear thinning property experiences stress surpassing its yield threshold when extruding through the nozzle. This mechanical strain induces a viscosity alteration, facilitating swift solidification subsequent to deposition [70]. Moreover, it was found that with different concentration ratios of EW and NaOH, the hydrogel’s mechanical properties can be easily tuned, such as the elongation ratio, tensile strength, and Young’s Modulus, making it a promising scaffold for use in various tissue engineering applications with different mechanical needs [23]. Notably, the same group further developed a 3D-printed sensor composed of EW hydrogel embedded with carbon nanotubes, which could record the radial augmentation index and the stiffness index of the cardiovascular system [23]. They also demonstrated that this hydrogel was capable of maintaining inherent bioactive elements after alkalization, supporting multiple biological activities in would healing, including angiogenesis and the promotion of collagen synthesis and assembly [45].",
        "Beyond these findings, the integration of egg white into vascular scaffolds amplified cellular affinity. For example, Mousseau et al. utilized a thermally crosslinked EW matrix to successfully fabricate a pre-vascular network with endothelial and smooth muscle cells [71]. In the study by Wang et al., EW hydrogels were capable of enhancing blood vessel distribution, epidermal tissue formation, and increased presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in mouse wound healing [50]. Hu et al. developed a triple-layered vascular scaffold whose inner and outer layers were composed of a polycaprolactone-collagen composite, whereas the middle layer contained an EW and sodium alginate composite (EW-SA) [72]. Intriguingly, they fabricated the middle EW-SA layer by using a coaxial extruded-based printing technique. This technique leveraged a coaxial nozzle to dispense a calcium chloride (CaCl2) aqueous solution, functioning as the cross-linking agent for the alginate component of the hydrogel, thus achieving rapid layer formation.",
        "EW has also garnered interest in bone regeneration research; its biocompatibility and antibacterial characteristics significantly improve the performance of bone/dental biomaterials, especially in in vivo studies [52,54,73,74,75]. Notably, Patty et al. developed a nanocomposite with EW, where ovalbumin significantly affected the pore sizes and porosity of their bone biomaterials, and controllable pore sizes and porosity could be achieved by involving different concentrations of EW [73]. Interestingly, another research group found that the presence of EW stimulated the expression of osteogenic genes, coding for bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin at mRNA level, indicating EW as a promotor of osteogenesis [75].",
        "With the addition of alginate, EW has been employed as a biomaterial for salivary gland cell culture [10,57]. EW proteins in the hydrogel are locked by a network of alginate polymers when cross-linked with CaCl2 [76]. As the backbone of the material, the concentration of alginate affects various physical properties including stiffness, porosity, and pore size [77,78]. Ultimately, changes in these properties could influence the gene expression and cell behavior of embedded cells. We found that EW mixed with 2% w/v alginate (EW:Alginate (2%) = 2:1) showed the greatest cell viability, and the largest spheroids were found in 3% EWA (EW:Alginate (3%) = 2:1) [57]. The study showed that cells grown on EW-Alginate (EWA) scaffold had comparable spheroid size to cells grown on Matrigel® over 3 weeks. Similarly, Duan et al. developed an EW dual crosslinked hydrogel with sodium hydroxide and CaCl2, and they found that increasing the concentration of calcium ions (from 0% to 4%) decreases the porosities of their hydrogels and the equilibrium swelling ratio [74].",
        "In summary, researchers have crafted wound healing hydrogels, tissue-engineering scaffolds, and even 3D-printable constructs using egg white. Its antibacterial and bioactive attributes persist, holding potential for vascular scaffolds, bone regeneration, and salivary gland cell culture advancements. Its biological, mechanical, and physiochemical properties could be easily tuned by choosing different crosslinkers and partner molecules and adjusting their molecule concentrations. These easily accessible and cost-effective EW biomaterials hold great promise for advancing the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, bridging the gap between scientific innovation and practical application.\nbiomolecules-14-00439-t001_Table 1Table 1Different gelation methods of EW and the biomedical applications.\nCrosslinker/Gelation Methods CrosslinksFeature(s) Application(s) Reference(s)Electrospun egg white/polyvinyl alcohol fiber1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl carbodiimide (EDC)Amide bonds between amines and carboxylic acid groupsGood spinnability (with 40–60% EW),mechanical strength, resistance to degradation, and good biocompatibility.Wound healing[48]Ovalbumin-flavonoids self-assembled hydrogelsFlavonoids(1)Hydrogen bond (between ovalbumin and puerarin/naringin/naringenin/genistein)(2)Hydrophobic interaction (between ovalbumin and daidzein)Promoted the gelation of ovalbumin in low concentration; generated a hydrogel more elastic than viscous.N/A[68]Ovalbumin hydrogel1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDE)Amide bondsUniform pore sizeN/A[62]EW-alginate hydrogelCalcium chlorideIonic bondsEasily reversible from hydrogel to solution(1)2.5D culture of human salivary acinar cells(2)3D printing[10,57,72]EW-hydroxypropyl chitosan hydrogelChitosanIntramolecular hydrogen bondingBiocompatibility,Anti-inflammationAntibacterial propertySelf-healing(1)3D printing(2)To heal deep partial-thickness skin burn wounds[49]EW-gelatin hydrogelGlutaraldehydeDisulfide bondsTunable viscosity (1)2D hydrocolloid films(2)Microfluidic(3)3D culture of Primary normal human dermal fibroblasts[79]EW hydrogelAlkalization and ionic crosslinkingHydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions,Ionic bonding.Tunable mechanical properties (elongation ratio, tensile strength and Young’s Modulus)(1)Direct-writing 3D printing(2)Wound healing(3)Electronic sensors[23,45,50]",

        "EY plasma is promising to be used as a biomaterial in tissue engineering, as it shares similarities with the plasma of human blood as both are enriched with peptides, antibodies, and nutrients. EY plasma can be obtained by centrifuging fresh EY at 15,400 RCF for 6 h [80]. However, the typical pH level of EY, which is around 6, may impede or have a negative impact on cell survivability. Our lab found that with the supplement of NaOH, commercial culture medium, PBS, or even EW, the EY’s pH could be altered from 6 to 7.3, which roughly resembles physiological pH, allowing for cells to survive in the presence of EY [81]. The gelation of EY plasma could be achieved by freezing the EY at −20 °C and then thawing it to 37 °C. It can stay in gel form at 37 °C, which allows the EY plasma to be 3D-printed as a tissue engineering scaffold with controllable geometries [80]. Specifically, EY plasma was used as a bio-ink in conjunction with EW and demonstrated cell proliferation of NS-SV-AC (a human salivary acinar cell line) without the support of a commercial culture medium over 14 days [81].",
        "Similarly, the EY hydrogel produced by freeze-drying and crosslinked by transglutaminase exhibited excellent rheological behavior and bonding strength for wound dressing [82].",
        "The biomedical applications of EY extend beyond its use as a hydrogel. Its fractions can also be isolated and incorporated into other materials. For instance, one study added EY oil to a chitosan gel to enhance the topical treatment properties for dermal burns, where its healing effects were statistically significant compared to Silverdin, a commercial product [83]. Moreover, as low-cost and biocompatible materials, EY and EW have been introduced to present technology to provide porous structures in microchannels of microfluidic devices, potentially applicable for biomedical diagnostics and environmental monitoring [84]. They could serve as perm-selective nano-porous materials to replace currently used nanostructures requiring sophisticated and expensive nanofabrication methods.",
        "However, the most well-known biomedical application of EY is the utilization of its existing antibodies. Immunoglobulin Y (IgY), the primary immunoglobulin present in avian blood, can be transmitted to their offspring and accumulate in EYs, providing access to large amounts of antibodies non-invasively [85]. Therefore, EY is a well-known and reputable source for customized antibodies in health research and has been developed and used in commercial therapeutics and as diagnostic tools [86,87].",
        "As eggshell is rich in CaCO3 and easily obtained, it is considered an excellent source of calcium to generate hydroxyapatite (HA), the primary component found in bones. Studies have promoted HA synthesis by mixing calcium from ES with fibroin and alginate, fabricating an injectable hydrogel as a scaffold for bone regeneration [88]. Another group utilized EW and ES to create a novel biomimetic hybrid hydrogel, incorporating eggshell particles to enhance the hydrogel’s mechanical properties [89]. Moreover, the hydrogel was observed to promote osteogenic differentiation in vivo, as evidenced by the detection of essential biomarkers like Runx2 and Col-1.",
        "ESM is also favorable in bone engineering research due to its collagen-based matrix and viscoelastic mechanical characteristics, offering a potential substitute for the extracellular bone structure. It has been characterized as porous and hydrophilic, and its biocompatibility can be improved by modifying its surface properties [90]. A novel 2D biomaterial for bone engineering, mineralized ESM, exhibited in vitro osteogenic differentiation and osteo-inductive properties [91]. The ESM was mineralized only on the outer surface, while the inner surface remained unmineralized. The mineral phase displayed chemical and structural characteristics resembling the inorganic phase of mineralized tissues, encouraging in vivo implantation studies and its potential use in dental/bone regeneration.",
        "ESM is also considered an excellent material for wound dressing as it promotes higher secretion of VEGF and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), enhancing the proliferation of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and umbilical vein endothelial cells [92,93,94].",
        "Interestingly, studies have suggested that ESM exhibits anti-aging properties by upregulating the decorin, MMP2, and type III collagen gene expressions, thereby enhancing the ECM environment within the papillary dermis of mice. Furthermore, a correlation was observed between elevated type III collagen levels and enhanced skin elasticity [95].",
        "In summary, both ES and ESM hold biomedical potential for bone engineering and wound dressing. Abundant in CaCO3, ES supports osteogenic differentiation and hydroxyapatite synthesis. ESM, featuring collagen matrix and viscoelasticity, could be further applied in bone regeneration and skin health.",
        "This review highlights the structure, physiochemical properties, composition, biological activity, and application of the four major components of the chicken egg: the eggshell, eggshell membrane, egg white, and egg yolk. Compared to other biomaterial available on the market, the chicken egg is widely available, accessible, and affordable, making it an excellent choice for research. Furthermore, as discussed in this review, there are clear benefits of using the chicken egg in biomedical and TERM research due to its diverse biological activities. The use of chicken egg components in conjunction with other biomaterials allows researchers to create composite biomaterials with unique and diverse properties as needed for various studies [96].",
        "However, researchers should be aware of the limitations of using the chicken egg as a biomaterial. The biggest limitation is the variation in the composition and physiochemical properties of the egg [97]. From batch to batch, eggs will exhibit slight variations in macronutrient and micronutrient properties. If using whole egg or whole egg components (e.g., ES, ESM, EW, or EY) for studies, the study outcomes may be affected by the changes of composition. This limitation may not apply if certain specific molecules are extracted for study purposes. Furthermore, depending on the chicken strain, diet, age, and temperature of storage, the chicken egg composition and quality of components may vary due to changes in pH and percentage of CO2 and water, thus ultimately affecting the quality and efficacy of select molecules and their function [98,99]. Researchers should seek to standardize—to the best of their ability—the source, storage condition, and timing of chicken eggs to optimize study accuracy and precision. Another limitation to consider is the allergen molecule, ovomucoid, found in the EW component. The egg is one of the most common food allergies; thus, as egg-based research progresses towards clinical studies, egg allergies should be a consideration.",
        "There are multiple ways to crosslink egg proteins. Some common methods include using chemical crosslinkers such as glutaraldehyde [79] or NaOH [23,45], thermal crosslinking through temperature changes [80,81], and enzymatic crosslinking using enzymes like transglutaminase [100]. These methods create bonds between protein molecules, resulting in a more stable structure for various applications in biomaterials and tissue engineering. However, many crosslinking methods (such as alkalization and heating) and a variety of crosslinking agents (such as EDC or glutaraldehyde) also lead to protein denaturation. Therefore, future research and considerations are needed regarding the decreased efficacy of denatured egg proteins when crosslinked, as there is potential for active egg proteins to demonstrate improved or distinct performance in certain applications.",
        "Our review has highlighted the wide usage of chicken egg research with promising and notable results. Continued research will further uncover the potential of chicken egg use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, whether it be use as a scaffold for cell growth and/or wound healing, as a vehicle for drug delivery, or as a source of nutrients. Future direction in egg research should look towards refining egg-based products and preparing for clinical studies and applications.",

        "With the ability of differentiation and self-renewing, the critical role of stem cells in the formation of organisms and tissue repair and regeneration has been highlighted [1–3]. In detail, the undifferentiated state of stem cells in various tissues, if necessary, they can undergo cell division, and then differentiate into specialized cell types through their symmetric and asymmetric division patterns. Meanwhile, mechanisms controlling stem cell fate are considered fundamental factors for tissue and organ development and homeostasis, which is also important for better application of stem cell-based therapies in vivo [4–7]. Given that stem cells are widely reported to be capable of secreting bioactive factors, exerting immune modulation and angiogenesis, stem cell therapy has been utilized to regenerate injured tissues in in vitro applications [8, 9]. From numerous published studies, stem cell therapies are progressively recognized as a critical building block in tissue regeneration, offering cures for a wide variety of diseases, such as diabetes, myocardial infarction, and inflammatory diseases [5, 10, 11]. However, many challenges limit the successful use of stem cell translation in clinical practice, such as low cell retention and engraftment and poor long-term maintenance of stem cell function [12–14]. Therefore, a supportive microenvironment is needed to regulate stem cell function by activating or potentiating intrinsic host repairment after cell administration.",
        "Engineered, fully defined materials are synthesized to overcome these bottlenecks regarding stem cell-based therapies. Biomaterials, conjugated growth factors [15] and tissue-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) [16], with tunable biophysical and biochemical properties to maintain and enhance stem cell function, are means of survival and differentiation of transplanted cells [2, 17]. Meanwhile, studies have shown that with heightened impacts of engraftment and differentiation, engineered materials co-transplanted with stem cells can facilitate functional recovery and structural integrity, such as angiogenesis and electromechanical improvement, providing a favorable niche for tissue regeneration [12, 18].",
        "Driven by these emerging engineered platforms, alterations in microenvironment-mediated stem cell fate may ultimately satisfy the therapeutic application of stem cells in the clinic.",
        "Therefore, in this review, the importance of engineered strategies in the regulation of stem cell homeostasis and fate in vitro, as well as mimicking the tissue microenvironment in vivo, is highlighted. At the same time, engineered platforms that control microenvironmental parameters and regulate cell–cell or cell-ECM interactions to direct stem cell growth and engraftment are discussed. Additionally, we summarize recent research on an artificial niche consisting of biomaterials, conjugated growth factors, or tissue-derived ECM, which can be utilized to provide a favorable microenvironment to enhance therapeutic effects in clinical translational applications (Table 1).Table 1Strategies for both synthetic and tissue-derived scaffolds to regulate cell microenvironmentModified microenvironmentManufacturing/processingEngineering strategiesReferenceInteraction with matrix proteinsBiomimetic scaffoldse gStem cell enhancement and engineering- Natural biomaterials- Alginate hydrogel[56]Chitosan (CS)[61]Tissue engineering and regenerationHyaluronans (HA)[64]- Synthetic biomaterials- Nanoparticle[60]Biomatrix collagen[63]PEG-HA-RGD-based hydrogel[62]RGD-alginate hydrogel[71]Immobilization of soluble factorsConjugated growth factors materialse gStem cell enhancement- CS/PGE2[79]Tissue repair and regenerationDextrin-rhEGF[99]ImmunomodulatoryControlled release materials- CS-IGF-1C[104]ProangiogenesisCS-NO hydrogel[106, 109]Interaction with ECM proteinsNatural ECM scaffoldse gStem cell enhancement- Tissue-derived ECM- Cartilage matrix[116]Tissue engineering and regenerationMatrigel[120]Decellularized placenta matrix scaffoldDecellularized placenta matrix scaffold[124]- Stem cell culture system by coating ECM scaffolds- Hypertrophic (HY) ECM[123]Endogenous ECM[127]Signaling feedback from modified nicheEVs scaffoldse g- RGD-biotin hydrogels[69]EVs engineeringCS-NO hydrogel[121]Tissue regenerationCollagen matrix[129]Stem cell differentiationChitosan (CS)[135]",
        "Strategies for both synthetic and tissue-derived scaffolds to regulate cell microenvironment",
        "With the ability to differentiate into an unlimited supply of tissue or organ-specific cells, stem cells can circumvent immunologic rejection after transplantation and promote the development of cell-based therapies in the treatment of a variety of debilitating disorders. Although cell therapy offers promise to restore function to benefit clinical practice, undesirable therapeutic outcomes challenge the translation process. The main hurdles that result in this phenomenon of stem cell-based therapy in clinical translational applications are as follows [19, 20]. When most cells leak out of the tissue or are mechanically washed out following blood flow, low retention rates of administered cells can be a critical limitation [21, 22]. Meanwhile, exogenous stem cells in the hostile, ischemic and inflammatory microenvironment are unfavorable to survival and proliferation, which even can lead massive cells to die in vivo [23]. Furthermore, modest improvement in stem cells cannot completely change the notable up-regulation of related oxidative stress and harmful cytokines, as well as anoikic at injured sites in the complex and dynamic pathological environment [20, 24, 25]. Another bottleneck is that the use of stem cells at the clinical level was not as effective as expected, various ex vivo processes must be performed to achieve the desired results [26]. In the hope of contributing to stem cell-based treatment options, enhanced strategies are summarized to address the low retention and survival of implanted cells. Interestingly, bioengineering approaches may provide solutions to overcome the current limitations in stem cell translational applications.",
        "Stem cells residing in specific anatomic locations in the body are also termed three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment or niches that include surrounding cells, ECM, secreted or bound biomolecules, and cytokines that are critical for their functional enhancement after transplantation [27]. The microenvironment as a dynamic system can trigger stem cell fate specification events such as quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation, contributing to a wide variety of physiological stages of development, homeostasis, and responses to injury/stress [28–30]. However, a poor environment on the one hand can be the main obstacle that leads transplanted cells to exhibit poor cellular retention and engraftment in vivo. On the other hand, the delivery of stem cells into an ischemic and hypoxic environment generally leads to cellular apoptosis and further poor cell viability and engraftment that affected successful translational applications [31, 32]. Furthermore, damaged tissues often lose deeper layers, indicating that the use of engineered scaffolds is important in establishing functionalized artificial niches for stem cell-based therapy [33]. To address these challenges, advances in modulating stem cell behavior, viability, and retention are urgently needed [34]. As it can modulate and recapitulate these complex cellular architectures and properties, as well as biochemical and biophysical signals, mimicking the native microenvironment is essential to guide stem cell fate decisions and control cell behavior [35, 36]. Consequently, engineered bioactive scaffolds that mimic the niche-like 3D microenvironment are hopeful strategies by regulating stem cell fate and cell–cell or cell–matrix interactions and allowing to be degraded and remodeled, which will eventually enhance therapeutic efficacy [37] (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Engineered microenvironment for stem cell therapy. Low cell retention and engraftment exist in vivo transplantation of stem cells. To address these challenges, biochemical or biophysical modifications of biomaterials are urgently needed to establish a favorable microenvironment for stem cell therapy. By means of engineered bioactive scaffolds, a suitable niche was designed to trigger specification events of stem cell fate specification events, enhancing cell differentiation, retention, engraftment, and self-renewal in vivo via cell–matrix or cell–cell interaction, and thus promoting tissue repair and regeneration",

        "Recent advances in the field of scaffold-based developmental tissue engineering are expected to revolutionize stem cell-based therapy via enhancing cell function in vivo after transplantation. The concept of developmental engineering strategy was first proposed by Lenas et al. by using biomaterial scaffolds as cell support [38]. Developmental engineering that includes several characteristics such as robustness for process stability and product reproducibility to resist to varieties of external adverse factors, signaling pathway dependence for in vitro developmental processes emphasizing the subsequential developmental stage, semi-autonomous meaning for self-established conditions and progresses naturally according to its needed processes, can facilitate tissue growth and cell differentiation, and the formation of intermediate tissue with modular behavior [38]. In other words, the strategy represents “in vitro biomimetics in vivo tissue development”, emphasizing the process of in vitro tissue engineering. Meanwhile, the rules of biomimetic process design have been developed comprehensively to enable tissue engineering to become a technology-based discipline, which promoted the improvement of cell-based therapy by constructing a cell microenvironment based on engineering scaffolds [39]. In the process of bone healing, the treatment of large bone defects is still a challenge for the remaining complications after bone grafting. The developmental engineering strategy to mimic the natural healing cascade or promote stem cell differentiation for rapid bone regeneration is considered a promising application in biomedicine [40, 41]. In the application of cell enhancement, artificial scaffold parameters such as appropriate soluble and surface-bound cytokines, cell–cell interactions, ECM, physicochemical cues, and mechanical forces are required to control and regulate stem cell behaviors through cell–cell or cell–matrix adhesion interactions [42, 43]. Strategies for stem cell enhancement and controlled release systems at a certain site of the body are necessary for tissue repair and regeneration. Therefore, stem cells incorporated with engineered biomaterials, growth factors, or small molecules are absolutely imperative to boost the retention and survival rate of stem cells and further facilitate tissue regeneration in vivo (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Strategies for artificial scaffolds for cell enhancement. Engineered biomaterials based on their biochemical and biophysical microenvironment, for example, the characteristics of biophysical cues of surface topography, material shape and size, and mechanical forces, as well as biochemical cues to conjugate growth factors, controlling to release specific small molecules and tissue-derived ECM scaffold, were extensively applied in stem cell-based therapy to improve cell maintenance in vitro and in vivo. Strategies designed to regulate cell behavior play an important role in enhancing therapeutic effects after transplantation in vivo",

        "Currently, biomaterials have spurred substantial advances to improve therapeutics at the clinical level, and at the same time, provide a favorable platform for the establishment of artificial niches to control stem cell culture and differentiation [2, 44]. On the basis of their components and structures, biomaterials are capable of transmitting specific signals on biochemical levels that satisfy the role of cells in the tissue repair process. Stem cells can interpret biomaterial instructions through cell–matrix interactions and then modulate their fate determination. To direct cell fate, several crucial parameters need to be considered within biomaterials, such as topography, chemistry, and physical properties. Several studies have reported that surface topography and chemical composition can regulate cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and proliferation [45, 46]. Gradually, scaffolds containing beneficial characteristics were introduced to satisfy engineering approaches, which could activate specific biological responses and not change bulk properties [47–49]. As the mechanical properties of the substrate can control stem cell fates, bio-nanocomposites represent a fundamental role in the improved mechanical and functional properties of synthetic polymers [50, 51].",
        "Moreover, some of the bio-nanocomposites could be modulated by introducing conductive nanostructures to exert electrical properties, such as carbon nanostructures (e.g., nanotubes, graphene, and nanofibers) and metal nanostructures (e.g., gold, silver). Results have suggested that the integration of two different nanostructures facilitates the development of bio-functional porous scaffolds that range from specific bioactivity, structural and mechanical integrity, to electrical conductivity. For example, Fortunati and Misra et al. developed a ternary nanocomposite scaffold, a novel biodegradable/bioactive composite material containing three different materials by incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) [52, 53]. Furthermore, with respect to the properties of interconnectivity, pore size, and shape, scaffold morphology is another critical factor for stem cell-biomaterial interaction. The appropriate morphology of biomaterial scaffolds, especially their microstructures, is important for cell differentiation and tissue response. In essence, smart polymeric nano-systems with an appropriate composition can be defined as artificial scaffolds to mimic the morphologic structure and function of the surrounding tissue. At the same time, scaffolds should also be capable of enhancing cell functions, such as cell attachment, differentiation, maintenance, and migration, as well as autocrine production of growth factors, immunomodulators, and other bioactive factors [46, 54, 55].",
        "Inspired by the better biophysical and biochemical properties of functional materials, integrative stem cells and engineering approaches are increasingly being utilized to address challenges in regenerative and translational medicine [56]. Compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture, three-dimensional (3D) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) culture exerts better multi-differentiation potential and can be considered an excellent culture system [57, 58]. In previous studies, thermosensitive hydrogels based on chitosan (CS), with their change from liquid to gelation at room temperature and excellent biocompatibility, are widely used as an ideal 3D injectable scaffold to deliver stem cells in the tissue repair and regeneration process [59, 60]. For example, the combination of chitosan-coated conduit and neurosphere cells with human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) exhibited functional recovery in the sciatic nerve [61]. Similarly, the enhanced approach of the hyaluronic acid hydrogel scaffold to deliver ADSCs has shown a notable improvement in the treatment of burn wounds, which is due to its properties of improving neovascularization and wound closure, and reducing scar formation [62]. Abundant evidence has explained that biomaterial scaffolds can alleviate noxious insults and create nurturing and protective environments that augment the therapeutic efficacy of implanted cells [63, 64].",
        "Biomimetic materials have been reported to serve as fully defined scaffolds or carriers to successfully deliver bioactive agents and therapeutic molecules for application in tissue engineering [65]. As stem cells require cell adhesion through cell–cell or cell-ECM interaction through integrin involvement to prevent anoikis, it is especially necessary to investigate integrin activation and cell adhesion in engineered biomaterials [66]. Studies have determined that the non-fouling native alginate has the characteristics of biocompatibility, high water content, tailor ability, and low cost, as well as easily modified to supply specific binding sites for cell adhesion. The hydrogel, an ideal 3D scaffold, contains specific cues for stem cell differentiation, reducing the inflammatory reaction after co-transplantation [67, 68]. In addition, a biofunctionalized scaffold of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD), a self-assembled peptide with a specific cell recognition motif, can bind strongly to the integrin of stem cells, triggering integrin-stimulated cell adhesion [69]. Tripeptide nanoparticles, as a widely used peptide sequence, could mimic the native niche by constructing a 3D structure environment [70]. Furthermore, a study on retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and neural retina generated from human embryonic stem cells/induced pluripotent stem cells (hESCs/hiPSCs) with RGD-alginate scaffolds also showed that it was useful to compensate for the current protocol and improved the formation of other pigmented, neural or epithelial tissue through the derivation, transportation and transplantation of neural retina and RPE [71]. Apparently, these findings initiate the survival and proliferative pathways of anchorage-dependent cells [72]. Engineered materials are ideal scaffolds for providing a biomimetic 3D system to support nano-biomaterial and stem cell interactions and to direct stem cell behavior [44, 73].",
        "In addition to the intrinsic regenerative, angiogenic, and tissue repair properties of stem cells, the immunomodulatory effect of innate and adaptive immune cells has been progressively investigated [74]. Influences of monocytes/macrophages on stem cell fate are considered important factors when stem cells are delivered to poor surroundings of diseased or injured tissues. Therefore, determining the immunophenotype of monocytes/macrophages among encapsulated stem cells is crucial for immune cells, which can be changed by absorbed proteins on the surface of the biomaterial by affecting their adhesion, apoptosis, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as the secretions of ECM proteins and growth factors [75, 76]. Furthermore, a study has revealed that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) incorporated into chitosan (CS) hydrogels can alleviate inflammation by promoting the transformation of M1 macrophages into the M2 phenotype, which can secrete high levels of interlukin-10 (IL-10) [77, 78]. Similarly, applying the incorporation of PGE2 and CS hydrogel to a murine cutaneous wound healing model exerted a better therapeutic effect, demonstrating the improvement of the niche at the injured site. Regulation of balanced cytokines and mediators in wound healing in vivo, especially the balance of three overlapping phases (Fig. 3) that include inflammation, regeneration (angiogenesis) and remolding (fibrosis), could guide tissue repair and regeneration [79]. Furthermore, a study of MSCs that entrap a specific macrophage immunophenotypes with the gelatin/polyethylene glycol-based matrix has indicated a considerable improvement in adipocyte differentiation and further promotes normal wound healing [80]. Advances in developmental engineering strategies with the capacity to construct a suitable microenvironment for stem cell-based therapy, protein replacements, or gene therapies may pave the way for some incurable diseases, such as rare genetic epidermolysis bullosa (EB) [81], and bone grafting [82].Fig. 3Incorporation of PGE2 into the CS hydrogel created a balanced microenvironment in vivo. Inflammation, tissue regeneration, and remodeling are three important phases in wound healing events at the injured site. In this study, the increased anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic activities of macrophages and the reduction of fibrosis were investigated, which demonstrated that the wound microenvironment was better improved by hydrogel in vivo, exhibiting a balanced niche of the overlapping inflammatory, regenerative (angiogenesis) and remodeling (fibrosis) phases of cutaneous wound healing.

        "The crucial role of immune cells involved in the tissue repair/regeneration processes after implantation or injury by secreting cytokines, promoting the degradation of ECM and clearing debris, can mediate the interaction between synthetic or tissue-derived biomaterials implantation and the cell microenvironment to orchestrate tissue regeneration. Therefore, the properties of biomaterial implants should be considered, such as appropriate physical, chemical, and biological signals [83, 84]. In detail, engineering biomaterials will recruit plasma proteins like fibronectin, vitronectin, albumin, and others on the surface after implantation, which are important factors to stimulate the adhesion and activity of immune cells [85]. Regarding the physical signals of implants, including shape, different surface properties, and substrate stiffness, increasing evidence demonstrated that the role of their immunomodulation properties mainly focused on macrophages by designing appropriate implants conditions to regulate the anti-inflammation response by the secretion of IL-4 and IL-10 (M2 subtype of macrophages) to meet the need for tissue restoration after injury [86, 87]. In terms of chemical signals, mounting studies have shown that the chemical composition of biomaterials, such as inorganic signals (metallic ions, ceramics), and functional groups, can be utilized and modified, and some of them can be released from biodegradable implants. These chemical signals can interact with immune cell adhesion and protein to control the production and release of cytokines in the process of immunomodulation in vivo [88, 89]. Biological factors such as genes, ECM, stem cells, and cytokines, as a straightforward way to influence immune responses, are regarded as an effective way for immunomodulation. The biomaterial network can be used as delivery system and support scaffold to regulate inflammation and tissue homeostasis [90, 91]. On the other hand, targeted immunomodulation strategies to mediate specific immune cells by providing a suitable microenvironment may drive the development of advanced tissue engineering and stem cell therapy.",
        "Growth factors can be used to support stem cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation by communicating with cells, which requires exogenous application in cell enhancement [92]. In the context of tissue repair and regeneration, the delivery of growth factors to adherent cells can stimulate and accelerate functional recovery of injured organs [93, 94]. Since exogenous growth factors are easily degraded in cultured medium, engineered biomaterials, such as hydrogels are suitable candidates for conjugation by means of proper chemistry, topography, and mechanics characteristics [95, 96]. In previous research, the conjugation of growth factors to bio-functional hydrogels that are capable of spontaneously eroding a physical microstructure on poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was developed. Then, covalent immobilization of growth factors was employed to use as an efficacious means of communicating with adhering cells and thus improved cell proliferation [97]. To guide the neuronal differentiation of MSCs, a nerve growth factor conjugated to electrospun nanofibrous meshes with its topographic signals significantly promoted cell function after injury [98]. Recently, studies have determined that localized delivery of dextrin-conjugated growth factors for bioactive therapeutic agents can support stem cell expansion and differentiation as an adjunct to promote tissue repair [99, 100]. Meanwhile, the hybrid biomaterial scaffold with conjugated growth factors to deliver bone marrow-derived MSCs in vivo effectively promoted neovascularization and bone formation in organ repair [101]. Furthermore, considering the essential role of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in tissue regeneration, a short synthetic IGF-1C peptide was introduced and immobilized in chitosan hydrogel material (CS-IGF-1C) and then transplanted with ADSCs, indicating a significant improvement in functional recovery and structural integrity of injured organs [12, 102]. Similarly, the artificial microenvironment of the CS-IGF-1C scaffolds exerted a good influence on angiogenesis in mouse hindlimb ischemia [103]. Furthermore, better therapeutic effects of the CS-IGF-1C scaffold were observed in a mouse colitis model by activating MSC secretion of PGE2 [104], which can promote M2 macrophage polarization (Fig. 4). On the basis of the above, the development of innovative and effective biomaterial scaffolds with conjugated growth factors is expected to be an alternative strategy in promoting the development of regenerative medicine.Fig. 4The engineering approach provides a niche for stem cell transplantation. A biomaterial designed with growth factors was applied for stem cell transplantation, for example, human placenta-derived MSCs (hP-MSCs) applied to treat trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice [104]. First, stem cells were cultured in CS-IGF-1C hydrogels in vitro, stimulating the production of PGE2, and then upregulating the cell proliferation markers of EGF, IGF-1, and HGF. Second, stem cells were co-transplanted with the hydrogel in vivo and PGE2 released from stem cell uptake through binding to its receptor in macrophages. Down-regulated genes of IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α were observed and the secretion of IL-10 by M2 macrophages, promoting the polarization of M2 macrophages in colitis of the mouse model. Finally, the results determined the functional recovery of colitis mice under the stem cell co-transplantation system of stem cells with conjugated growth factors",

        "Currently, engineered substrates with controlled release of bioactive factors, proteins, or growth factors have been regarded as vehicles to offer a desirable niche for stem cell delivery, which can improve cell proliferation and engraftment and further improve the therapeutic efficacy of implanted cells [105, 106]. Nitric oxide (NO), a highly reactive radical, is an essential molecule to regulate cellular/molecular functions and physiological processes associated with tissue regeneration in mammals [107]. However, the short biological half-life of NO limited its application in stem cells [108]. In response to local NO release, a preliminary study of endothelial differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) was observed when ESCs were incorporated in a CS-based hydrogel to release NO in a controllable manner. Clearly, NO release occurred only in the presence of β-galactosidase [21]. Similarly, stem cells with NO stimulation have also been shown to exert superior therapeutic effects by enhancing the proangiogenic potential in mouse hindlimb ischemia [109]. Meanwhile, to fully capture and control bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2), a platform with nanoporous poly (lactide-coglycolide) (PLGA) microspheres mediated by soybean lecithin (SL) was developed to deliver stem cells and was ultimately determined to be significant for bone tissue regeneration [110]. Recently, a study showed that injectable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (GMs) act as carriers to control growth factor release and as a delivery vehicle for transplanted stem cells to promote functional recovery of injured tissues in rat degenerative disc disease [111]. Collectively, stem cells are co-transplanted with bio-functional scaffolds that carry profitable bioactive factors, which can not only create optimized microenvironments to improve cell function, but also act as controllable release systems to compensate for the energy and nutrition deficit due to diseased conditions in the body and eventually facilitate tissue repair and regeneration (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Controlled release of small molecules, growth factors, and proteins. Control release systems can be considered an effective way to modulate stem cell behavior. a The utilization of NO-releasing hydrogels to support stem cell delivery through the control of NO generation can upregulate the expression of endothelial cell-like phenotypes, such as VEGFA, bFGF, ANG1, ANG2, and then significantly facilitate neovascularization in mouse with ischemic hindlimb [109]; b Injectable GMs were employed to deliver growth factors and as vehicles of stem cells, which can promote cell differentiation into nucleus pulposus (NP)-like gene markers of COL2, ACAN, Krt19, CD24, determining a promising approach for the in vivo treatment of rat degenerative disc disease [111]; c The PLGA and SL deliver system were designed to control the release of BMP-2, and then applied the platform to build a suitable microenvironment for stem cell culture. In this culture system, stem cell matrix mineralization abilities were detected, and osteogenic cell-related gene expression of COL-1, OCN, OPN, and RUNX2 was demonstrated, indicating the potential of the engineered platform for bone tissue regeneration [110]",

        "The extracellular matrix (ECM), as one of the important microenvironment parameters of stem cells, is closely related to cell survival and fate. Mounting evidence has suggested that the ECM-based microenvironment is related to the biophysical properties and biochemical extracellular stimuli of stem cells and could determine the cell fate between self-renewal and differentiation [112]. Constitutively, it can be obvious that the limits of transplanted stem cells can be attributed to the loss of their excellent potential when taken outside of their niche, leaving them alone at injured sites where there is no functional vascular network to support cell survival [113, 114]. Advancing in the microenvironment based on engineered ECM has been gradually shown for stem cell therapy [115]. Additionally, the mechanical properties of biomaterial scaffolds, especially tissue-derived ECM is particularly crucial for a 3D cell culture system. With the characteristics of viscoelastic and stress relaxation, ECM has been widely applied in the field of tissue regeneration, such as cartilage tissue engineering, where the mechanical confinement of ECM regulates chondrocytes to form cartilage matrix to replace damaged cartilage. Simultaneously, the tunable mechanical properties of matrix scaffolds can enhance stem cell function, such as the capacity of activity and osteogenic differentiation [116–118]. Therefore, considering the significance of cell-ECM interactions in the engineering strategy for cell culture, the mechanical parameters of biomaterial scaffolds should be highlighted.",
        "Matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane, is considered a commonly used plate-coding matrix for controlling stem cell fate and a vehicle for cell administration in a variety of dimensions [119, 120]. Similarly, when human ESC-derived endothelial cells were suspended in Matrigel, the supplied substrate could considerably reverse the down-regulated expression of a series of ECM and adhesion molecule-specific genes [121]. The changes in these genes after cell detachment provided valuable information for the interaction between cell-ECM [122]. Furthermore, the strategy that uses the hypertrophic type of designed ECM scaffolds providing the necessary microenvironment of endochondral ossification by regulating stem cell functions is important for promoting osteogenic differentiation and repairing bone defect [123]. Recently, a study on decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) isolated from perinatal tissues, especially placenta-derived ECM, has shown significant effects on anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic in skin wound healing. At the same time, this research identified the crucial role of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the treatment of wound injury [124], providing an encouraging substitute to employ the GAG-enriched placental dECM hydrogel for cell or drug delivery in the development of tissue regeneration.",
        "Importantly, depending on the characteristics and properties of ECM scaffolds, it is of great importance to deliver meaningful soluble and immobilized factors in the determination of sophisticated extracellular signals such as self-renewal and lineage commitment [125, 126]. Preliminary research has shown that human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) cultivated with endogenous ECM and adhesion molecules facilitate cell retention and are beneficial for cardiac function recovery when injected directly into the intramyocardial tract in a rat model [127]. Moreover, collagen, as an important component of ECM that relies on many biological activities and good mechanical properties, provides a favorable niche for stem cell growth. For example, a functional collagen matrix scaffold was used to improve stem cell function by promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration for in situ tendon regeneration [128, 129]. Collectively, the benefits of an ECM-based niche that improves the survival and revascularization of administered stem cells are a promising strategy to be further developed.",
        "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from cells can carry vital information in the form of lipids, proteins, mRNAs, and small RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and can participate in intercellular communication [130, 131]. Recently, EVs as paracrine factors released from stem cells have been extensively utilized in varying animal disease models and are an alternative to stem cell-based therapy due to their therapeutic potential [132]. However, the retention and stability of EVs following time in vivo after transplantation can be a major obstacle in clinical reality [133]. Hopefully, after encapsulation and transplantation with engineering strategies, EVs can maintain their biological activity and achieve controlled release in vivo for a longer time [134]. When stem cell-derived EVs were incorporated with the CS hydrogel, the stability of miRNAs and proteins, as well as their retention, was significantly enhanced in vivo. Meanwhile, the abilities of pro-angiogenesis and endothelium-protective of engineered EVs were assessed in vitro, demonstrating better therapeutic effects for hindlimb ischemia [135]. Additionally, EVs released from nitric oxide-releasing polymer treated MSCs exhibited proangiogenic capacity both in vitro and in vivo by building a microenvironment for stem cell culture, which revealed superior tissue repair and functional recovery for ischemic disease [106]. In general, engineering strategies may facilitate the development of cell-free therapeutic applications, whether biomaterial scaffolds were incorporated with stem cell-derived EVs, or applied to cell culture systems.",
        "Many effective strategies for stem cell therapy have been translated into clinical investigations as a result of considerable favorable supports in the regenerative capacity of stem cells [136]. Furthermore, increasing research has shown that stem cell transplantation has the potential to allow specific regeneration of injured or diseased tissue in patients [17]. Although with the transient presence of stem cells in a few days after transplantation, clinical investigations using stem cell products have exerted a significant tropic influence on immune and inflammatory responses after transplantation, especially the two successful applications of limbal stem cells for eye burns and MSCs for pediatric graft versus host disease [137]. Additionally, engineered platforms such as biomaterials, conjugated growth factors and small molecules, and tissue-derived ECM providing a favorable microenvironment for stem cell function are emerging as a means of approach for tissue regeneration in preclinical studies [129, 138]. Hence, driven by the increasing development of engineered platforms, the advancement of cell niches can elicit excellent properties of translational therapy, which is full of hope for improving disease prevention and treatment and eventually contributing benefits to patients.",
        "Regarding its significant properties on the paracrine secretion of bioactive factors, angiogenesis, and immunoregulation, stem cell-based therapy has potent therapeutic effects on diseases such as myocardial fraction, hindlimb ischemia, cutaneous wound, colitis, kidney, and spinal injury, as well as bone defect/graft and ocular burns, and thus can be considered a promising approach in regenerative medicine. Moreover, biomaterials and materials with conjugated growth factors and small molecules, as well as dECM matrix, have largely served as bioactive scaffolds to engineer a suitable niche to facilitate functional recovery of implanted cells and further enhance therapeutic efficacy in vivo. In conclusion, engineered platforms provide a favorable microenvironment to promote the maintenance and engraftment of exogenous cells. Meanwhile, stem cell therapy should attach more importance to the application of developmental engineering strategies, which provide excellent properties in improving the functional recovery and structural integrity of diseased organs.",

        "The brain, being an intricate part of the central nervous system (CNS), is responsible for integrating and regulating information in the nervous system along with the spinal cord. Injuries to the CNS caused by diseases, disorders, or accidents are very critical due to the limited regenerative capacity of CNS tissues, intricate neural circuitry, and complex inflammatory responses. The presence of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) restricts the entry of therapeutic agents into the CNS, and the formation of glial scars at the lesion can hinder axonal regrowth. Secondary injury processes, including excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, further exacerbate damage. Timing of therapeutic interventions, heterogeneity of injuries, ethical concerns, and patient‐specific variability add to the complexity. Moreover, stroke, trauma, and a variety of neurodegenerative disorders can cause damage and death of neuronal tissue in the CNS. In view of the limited regenerative capacity of the CNS, damage to the CNS tissue can have severe consequences on the individual. Since CNS injuries have a profound impact on our society and existing pharmacological treatments are not effective enough, novel therapeutic approaches that target the regeneration of CNS tissue are essential.\n1",
        "To address and facilitate the recovery of the impaired CNS, cell‐based repair has emerged as a mechanism for replacing damaged or degenerating cells and repairing CNS tissues. The therapeutic potential of cell‐based therapies lies in the reconstruction of damaged circuitry via (a) replacement of damaged neurons directly, (b) secretion of therapeutic factors enhancing neuroprotection, anti‐inflammatory effects, or enhanced angiogenesis in the pathological host environment, and (c) creating an environment that promotes neuroplasticity in the host. This cell‐based repair strategy encompasses the utilization of cellular entities to substitute impaired or depleted brain cells. This method entails employing either autologous cells, derived from the patient's own body, or allogeneic cells sourced from a donor.\n2\n Stem cells, characterized by their undifferentiated nature with the capacity to develop into diverse cell lineages, stand as a potential cell source for this therapeutic approach. The strategy of implementing cell‐based therapy can be executed via direct cerebral injection of cells at the injury site.\n3\n The therapeutic benefits of cell repair have been demonstrated in numerous preclinical studies, and its effectiveness is currently being evaluated in several clinical trials.\n1\n However, despite the progression of cell‐based CNS reparation as a therapeutic strategy throughout the years, substantial barriers, including immune rejection, difficulty in targeting specific brain regions, and potential risks of tumorigenesis, have impeded its widespread implementation in clinical settings. Hence, as an alternate, cell‐based biomaterials like hydrogels, constituting gel‐like substances amenable to injection into the brain, offer a platform to facilitate cellular proliferation and viability.\n4\n Hydrogels have demonstrated their suitability as biomaterials for brain tissue regeneration due to their unique characteristics. These materials feature three‐dimensional crosslinked polymer networks with a water content exceeding 90%. Additionally, hydrogels offer adjustable physicochemical properties, enabling them to conform to irregular brain cavities effectively. They create a favorable microenvironment conducive to the growth and proliferation of nerve cells. Furthermore, their porous internal structure imparts softness and flexibility, minimizing tissue damage during application. These hydrogels furnish a scaffold for cellular growth and afford immunoprotection to the cells. Beyond the mere replacement of damaged cells, cell‐based hydrogels also possess the capability to induce repair and regeneration of compromised brain tissue. This outcome may arise through the secretion of growth factors or other signaling molecules by the transplanted cells or by instigating the patient's endogenous cells into restoring and regenerating the afflicted tissue.\n5\n, \n6",
        "Traditionally, highly viscous noninjectable hydrogels like polyethylene glycol (PEG) and poly 2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate hydrogels (poly‐HEMA) have been employed to treat CNS injuries and are adapted for tissue engineering purposes. These hydrogels are modified with substances like arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) and natural materials such as alginate, gelatin, agarose, hyaluronic acid (HA), and chitosan to enhance cell adhesion, making them effective biomaterial scaffolds for treating brain lesions. However, their physical properties limit their application, with systemic or direct brain administration causing cell loss or dispersion. Attempts to scale up vascular transport during implantation can worsen cerebral ischemia due to blood flow obstruction during open surgery or incisions. Moreover, implanted biomaterials often trigger neuro‐immune reactions, disrupting the BBB and causing inflammation with plasma and peripheral blood cells entering the ventricle. In the context of CNS injury, injectable biomaterials may be used to repair or replace damaged tissue or to deliver drugs or other therapeutic agents to specific locations within the brain.\n7\n Nanoparticles (NPs) and microparticles are also potent injectable biomaterials used for brain injury repair. These particles have advantageous properties such as smaller size, shape, and structure.\n8\n It is easier to introduce them into biomaterial matrix containing stem cells, which offers a beneficial mechanism for continuous and smooth delivery of medication.",
        "Injectable hydrogels as potential biomaterials offer several potential advantages for the treatment of CNS injury. They can be designed to release drugs or other agents over a controlled period of time, allowing for sustained therapeutic effects.\n9\n They can also be designed to be biocompatible and biodegradable since they are not harmful to the body and can be safely broken down and eliminated after use. In addition, injectable biomaterials may be able to cross the BBB, the protective layer of cells surrounding the brain.\n10\n Overall, injectable biomaterials hold great promise as a means of treating CNS injury and improving the lives of individuals affected by these conditions. On this basis, this comprehensive review is drafted to provide an overview of different CNS conditions that require cell reparation. It also explores the potential biomaterial methodologies that can enhance the efficacy of treating brain injuries. Moreover, this narrative review covers various aspects of the topic, including the current state of research, available interventions, challenges, and advancements in the field.",
        "All relevant information concerning injectable biomaterials for CNS injury was collected from published literature in the English language. Published preclinical and clinical study results were reported in the current study. We conducted a comprehensive literature search from 2001 to 2023 in major scientific databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Springer Link. Among the search terms and Boolean operators used were “Injectable Biomaterials” AND “Neurodegenerative diseases; Brain injury; Brain tumor; Nerve injury”; “Injectable biomaterials” AND “Cell based therapy”; “Injectable biomaterials” AND “nanoparticles”; “Injectable biomaterials” AND “microparticles”; “Injectable biomaterials” AND “Hydrogels”, without any word limits. A total of 1535 documents were retrieved from the initial database searches. These documents underwent a rigorous screening process. Two independent reviewers initially screened titles and abstracts for relevance based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria include the availability of English‐language data, strategies for repairing brain injury, diseases amenable to cell‐based therapies, along with some applications of different hydrogels for CNS injury. As well, books and abstracts that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Articles with insufficient or ambiguous data as well as articles written in languages other than English were excluded from consideration. After excluding such literature with insufficient data or published in a foreign language, 130 studies were finally included in the study for data extraction and synthesis. Notably, the selected 130 studies provided a comprehensive basis for synthesizing the current state of knowledge regarding the use of injectable hydrogels in CNS injury contexts. This methodology allowed us to encompass a wide range of research, ensuring the relevance and quality of the included studies in our narrative review.",

        "These injuries can result in paralysis and loss of sensation due to damage to the spinal cord. Cell‐based therapies, such as the transplantation of neural stem cells, have been shown to promote nerve regrowth and improve functional recovery in animal studies. Several methods of cell transplantation are being explored as therapeutic strategies for SCI, including modulating the host immune response, enhancing axonal plasticity, providing neurotrophic support, and replacing damaged cells.\n18\n It has been demonstrated that neural progenitor cells are effective at improving motor function and forming synaptic connections between grafted neurons and host neurons when transplanted into rodent and nonhuman primate models of severe SCI. In the case of SCI, numerous stem cells, including neural stem cells (NSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), Wharton jelly stem cells, adipose‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs), umbilical cord blood stem cells (UCB‐SCs), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), umbilical cord‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC‐MSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have been shown to be effective in the repair of SCI. Constructed NSCs‐derived neural network tissue with strong survival within an NT‐3/fibroin‐coated gelatin sponge (NF‐GS) scaffold, modified by tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC). After receiving tissue from neural networks produced from NSCs that had been transformed by TrkC, SCI‐affected rats' recovery of motor function was noticeably enhanced. Together, the findings revealed that a useful method for researching and creating SCI treatments involves transplanting the neural network tissue created in the three‐dimensional (3D) bioactive scaffold.\n19\n, \n20\n Moreover, the synergistic application involves the coalescence of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)‐derived neural stem cells (iNSCs) with a 3D construct of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel, aimed at fostering regenerative processes subsequent to SCI. A mouse spinal cord transection model was created to evaluate the GelMA hydrogels' impact on in vivo neuronal regeneration. Implants made of GelMA/iNSC greatly aided functional recovery. Additional histological examination revealed that the GelMA/iNSC group had much smaller cavity regions and less collagen was deposited. Additionally, the combination of GelMA and iNSC transplantation reduced inflammation by lowering active macrophages/microglia (CD68‐positive cells). Furthermore, the implantation of GelMA/iNSC showcased noteworthy therapeutic outcomes by forestalling the formation of glial scars and GFAP‐positive cells, concomitantly fostering the regeneration of axons. The utilization of this tridimensional hydrogel laden with stem cells stands undoubtedly as a prospective therapeutic modality for SCI reparation.\n21\n Notably, rats afflicted with SCI and subjected to a dual intervention involving edaravone injection alongside Schwann cell transplantation exhibited enhanced neurological functionality coupled with the regrowth of nerve fibers.\n22\n A typical representation of the delivery of stem cells into the brain is represented in Figure 1.",

        "TBI is still a leading cause of mortality and disability, affecting an estimated 10 million individuals each year. TBI is a disease that destroys normal brain function and produces major physical, cognitive, and emotional problems. TBI pathophysiology consists mostly of a breach of the BBB, widespread neuro‐inflammation, diffuse axonal damage, and neurodegenerative abnormalities.\n23\n Preclinical research has demonstrated the potential therapeutic usefulness of stem cell therapy. In preclinical research, neuroprotective and regenerative capabilities of stem cells have been proposed as the mechanism of action.\n24\n In recent years, research has discovered that a number of stem cells, including MSCs, NSCs, multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), and EPCs, can heal neurological damage following TBI.\n25\n STEMTRA, a recently completed phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02416492) that observed the potential effects of intracranial administration of bone marrow‐derived cells on patients with chronic motor deficit from TBI, discovered that significantly more patients receiving cell treatment showed enhanced motor status at 6 months in comparison to the patients receiving a control sham.\n10",
        "Strokes are the third most common cause of disability and the second most common cause of mortality worldwide. Stroke, being the major cause of depression and dementia, causes brain cells to die suddenly due to lack of oxygen flow to the brain.\n26\n Merely two treatments possess approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke, namely tissue plasminogen activator and thrombectomy. Remarkably, despite being the second leading cause of both mortality and enduring incapacitation on a global scale, the available therapeutic options remain limited. As a multimodal therapy with the potential to produce neuroprotective and regenerative growth factors as well as potentially acting as cell replacement for lost and injured brain cell types, NSCs have attracted a lot of attention.\n27\n NSCs‐based therapy may be significant among cell types due to its capacity for neuronal differentiation, as well as its capacity to promote endogenous neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and the control of the neuro‐inflammatory system.\n28\n, \n29\n Although cell‐based therapy may be an effective stroke treatment, there are still numerous obstacles to overcome, such as poor transplanted cell yields and the heterogeneity of the disease and injured tissue.",
        "PD is an incurable condition that causes the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta to degenerate locally. Many of the PD treatments available today can only treat the symptoms, not the underlying neurodegeneration that causes PD. MSCs, ESCs, NSCs, and iPSCs‐based cell treatment have been the subject of numerous animal research.\n30\n, \n31\n The efficacy of cell replacement therapy for PD is widely supported by these preclinical investigations, providing a viable substitute for pharmaceutical therapies. Additionally, cell repair has been used in numerous clinical investigations for PD. For instance, the European research group TRANSEURO was founded in 2010 (NCT01898390) to examine the therapeutic effectiveness of utilizing transplants of the fetal ventral mesencephalon to replace cells in PD.\n10\n, \n32\n Using iPSCs, recent developments in the fields of cellular reprogramming and personalized medicine now enable the development of cell therapies that were previously unreachable and the patient‐specific modeling of PD using iPSCs.\n33\n iPSCs can be specifically differentiated to become dopaminergic neurons, which are prone to neurodegeneration naturally. The first striking human trial for iPSC transplantation in PD started in Japan in 2018. One of the strongest possibilities for slowing or perhaps reversing the progression of PD at the moment is this type of cell treatment, which has demonstrated encouraging outcomes in other model organisms.\n34",
        "AD is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid (Aβ) plaques that eventually form in degenerating neurons of the aged brain. These protein plaques are mostly made up of Aβ fibrils and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of phosphorylated tau protein. Despite the development of several cholinesterase inhibitors, N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, and monoclonal antibodies to prevent neurodegeneration, trigger neural regeneration, or clear up Aβ deposits, none of the treatments are helpful in alleviating the cognitive and memory dysfunctions of AD patients. As a result, stem cell therapy represents a potent treatment option for AD.\n35\n, \n36\n AD stem cell sources include NSCs, ESCs, and MSCs derived from bone marrow, umbilical cord, and umbilical cord blood. Patient‐specific iPSCs in particular are presented as a future potential and a challenge for the treatment of AD.\n37\n, \n38\n As a replacement or regeneration method, stem cell‐based treatment provides new promise for AD treatment. MSCs are multipotent stem cells with immunomodulatory capabilities and excellent biosafety, as well as the potential to synthesize neurotrophic and proangiogenic molecules, making them effective for neuro‐regeneration.\n39\n In the instance of AD, MSCs‐based therapies have demonstrated the ability to heal damaged brain tissue while also slowing disease progression. Although the exact treatment mechanism effect of stem cell transplantation is unknown, MSCs therapy has demonstrated to be an alternative therapeutic option for neurodegenerative illnesses such as AD. Several clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the utility of MSC infusions in patients with AD.\n40\n For example, the Korean business Medipost conducted a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02054208) in patients with AD to evaluate intra‐ventricular delivery of a product named NEUROSTEM®, (UCB‐MSCs). Another product, Astro Stem, employs ADMSCs and will shortly be evaluated in patients with AD in a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04482413).\n10\n Similarly, NSCs transplantation, which targets both neuron networks and pathogenic proteins, has a positive effect on behavior and the microenvironment. NSCs stimulate endogenous synaptogenesis, which improves cognition. However, it is challenging to correctly characterize NSCs' positive effects in AD.\n41",
        "Exceeding a global count of 2 million individuals, MS affects a substantial populace and manifests as a persistent inflammatory disorder of the CNS. The intricate nature of MS arises from the interplay between genetic propensities and environmental hazards, contributing to its onset. A variation of the HLA‐DRB1 gene of the major histocompatibility complex is the key genetic determinant linked to MS susceptibility, but there are numerous other minor genetic risk factors as well.\n42\n, \n43\n The term “stem cell therapy” refers to a vast field that includes the therapeutic transplantation of numerous stem/progenitor cell types derived from diverse tissues into potential patients. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transplantation\n44\n is presently the only method with clinical validation in this area. This method, which is frequently used to treat hematologic malignancies including multiple myeloma and leukemia, is also showing amazing results in patients with active RRMS who do not react to DMTs.\n45",
        "In the context of CNS injury, injectable biomaterials serve the purpose of repairing or replacing damaged tissue. Additionally, they enable precise drug delivery to specific locations within the brain. Different biomaterials including cell‐based hydrogels, microparticles, NPs are effectively used for targeted delivery of therapeutics to the brain, which are discussed as follows. Moreover, a pictorial representation illustrating the characteristics and similarities and differences of these biomaterials is shown in Figure 2.",

        "The brain is an intricate part of the CNS, responsible for integrating and regulating information in the nervous system along with the spinal cord. Injuries to the CNS due to diseases, disorders, or accidents are very critical as it hardly regenerates.\n46\n The rapid movement of astrocytes towards injured sites prevents further damage to the neural network by forming glial scars around the injured sites. The brain damage became irreversible due to inadequate regeneration of neurons and axons and the development of glial scars at the lesion.\n47\n Facilitating the recovery of neuron and axon regeneration by NSCs transplantation along with inhibitory antibodies is quite a hurdle, preventing its pervasive clinical practice.\n48\n However, due to inadequate physical support to the lesion as well as microenvironment cherishing the cell growth makes neural cell transplantation scant for substantial brain injury. A variety of biomaterials with physicochemical properties that can be altered in response to the environment, such as malleable biodegradability, tissue‐like mechanical properties with structural resemblance to extracellular matrix (ECM), pertinent bioactivity, and cytocompatibility, have emerged into focus for the purpose of providing a microenvironment for cell growth and tissue regeneration of soft tissue, bone, and the peripheral nervous system as well as the CNS.\n49\n, \n50\n The ideal material for regenerating brain tissue has proven to be hydrogels, as they contain 3‐dimensional crosslinked polymer networks with a water content above 90%. Moreover, hydrogels possess adjustable physicochemical properties for filling the irregular cavity in the brain. It can also provide a favorable microenvironment for nerve cell growth and proliferation; apart from that, the porous internal structure provides its softness and suppleness, leading to the minimization of tissue damage.\n10\n Traditionally, non‐injectable, very viscous hydrogels have been used to treat CNS injuries. In tissue engineering, such hydrogels are frequently converted into external wound dressings or implantable biomaterial scaffolds.\n51\n Noninjectable hydrogels with mechanical qualities like those of brain tissue are commonly utilized in the regeneration of brain tissues, which includes PEG and poly‐HEMA. After being modified with the RGD sequence and natural substances including alginate, gelatin, agarose, hyaluronic acid (HA), and chitosan, the capacity of hydrogels to adhere to cells dramatically increases, enhancing their effectiveness as biomaterial scaffolds for treating brain lesions.\n52\n However, the physical characteristics of non‐injectable hydrogels limit the range of applications, when administered systemically or directly into the brain, most transplanted cells perish or spread to the peripheral organs. Furthermore, scaling up vascular transport of stem/progenitor cells might aggravate cerebral ischemia by obstructing blood flow to the brain, since implantation is only possible through an open surgery or requires a substantial incision to be made.\n53\n Also, the implanted biomaterials frequently cause neuro‐immune reactions, causing the BBB to be broken and plasma and peripheral blood cells to enter the ventricle. Inflammation and neuro‐immune reactions can be brought on by an influx of fluid and peripheral blood cells, such as lymphocytes and macrophages.\n54\n Drugs or cells can be directly delivered by injectable hydrogels to the damaged area of the brain, protecting the BBB. The CNS may be treated with drugs using injectable hydrogels, and neuronal stem cells can be transported using these hydrogels as scaffolds.\n55\n As minimally invasive surgery continues to advance, the usage of injectable hydrogels adapts to the brain's environment and satisfies the evolving needs of biomaterials for smaller surgical sites. The in situ injection of hydrogels promotes gelation, which results in the clearing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and restricts extensive dissemination to maintain local release of hydrogel in the lesion region, might be accelerated by revamping the physical and chemical characteristics.\n56\n, \n57\n With every new technological advancement, hydrogels design quickly develops, enhancing every component of cell repair (cell adhesion, biological signals) to deliver the most effective neuroprotective result to the targeted cells.",
        "Novel drug administration of liposomes, polymeric micelles, and NPs have the potentials to be powerful tools for addressing CNS injuries. NPs containing germane molecules are suitable biomolecules, and an important resource for in situ administration in the CNS. Because of their tiny size, encapsulated biomolecules containing active chemicals can traverse the BBB, improving pharmacological profile while limiting toxicity.\n58\n Due to limited regenerative impact of delivering biomolecules alone in damaged tissue, nanoparticle unaided approach is not befitting for tissue regeneration in CNS. However, the potential of micro‐carriers and other microscale materials for cell‐based brain healing in the brain has been demonstrated by a variety of research.",
        "Formulations of polymeric micro/nanoparticles for the controlled release of hydrophobic and hydrophilic biomolecular medicines have been extensively developed. The preservation of biomolecule activity and biomolecule diffusion from the delivery site to the target site are challenges in the design of micro/nanoparticle formulations for CNS regeneration. The majority of micro/nanoparticles deployed in the CNS are made of poly‐lactic‐co‐glycolic acid (PLGA), a biodegradable polymer that has been recognized for use in medicine. After being injected into tissue for CNS distribution, PLGA micro‐particles cause a modest microglial/astroglial response and can linger there for up to 4 months.\n59\n, \n60\n The use of nerve growth factor (NGF) or GDNF‐containing PLGA micro‐particles for the treatment of PD, AD, and retinal degeneration is widespread.\n58\n The neurotrophins were released in vitro over a period of 6 weeks with a high burst release typical of PLGA micro‐particles, and this led to both tissue regeneration and functional gains. It is undesirable because surfactants can be cytotoxic that high quantities of surfactants were needed to disperse the micro‐particles for injection.\n61\n Another strategy is to distribute both cells and medicinal compounds using pharmacologically active micro‐carriers. One such instance is the in vitro seeding and in vivo transplantation of fetal ventral mesencephalic transplants in the hemi‐Parkinsonian rat striatum using PLGA micro‐carriers functionalized with GDNF.\n62\n, \n63\n This method increased the cells’ capacity for functional function as well as for reinnervation and survival. In preclinical models of stroke, pharmacologically active micro‐carriers have also been employed to increase the reparative capability of a population of MSCs known as marrow‐isolated adult multilineage inducible (MIAMI) cells,\n63\n, \n64\n PD\n62\n and Huntington's disease.\n65\n Apart from that another approach was made earlier to embryonic rat hippocampal neurons which were effectively matured and transplanted into the adult rat hippocampus using colloidal glass microbeads.\n66",
        "Approaches are being developed to combine micro/nanoparticles acting like carriers along with cell‐loaded hydrogels, such as the preparation of a MnO2 NPs dotted hydrogels involve dispersing MnO2 NPs in a PPFLMLLKGSTR peptide in modified hydrogels made of hyaluronic acid. MSCs can adhere to the hydrogels' surface and bridge nerve tissue with it. The MnO2 NPs successfully increase MSCs viability by reducing the oxidative environment. On a long‐span rat spinal cord transection model, MSCs transplantation results in a significant recovery of motor function. It also causes in vivo integration and neural differentiation of the implanted MSCs, which results in a highly effective regeneration of CNS spinal cord tissues. Therefore, by the thorough management of pathological microenvironment problems, the MnO2 NPs dotted hydrogels represents a promising technique for stem‐cell‐based therapy of CNS illnesses.\n67\n Also, a significant potential has been introduced to treat pathological imbalance of zinc during epilepsy and dementia by using a hydrogel made of HA generated from skeletal muscle, ZnONPs are delivered locally to the damaged spinal cord (ZnONPs‐Gel). In this study, ZnONPs‐Gel implantation successfully restored hindlimb motor function in SCI mice by controlling the focal microenvironment and reducing reactive oxygen species and inflammation. This work created a novel method for administering ZnONPs locally to treat SCI.\n68\n The hydrogels maintain the cells and particles in the treatment location while the particles provide a continuous, long‐term release of the biomolecules, such as neurotrophic factors to boost cell survival. This synergistic method offers several benefits. Numerous research on PD have demonstrated the positive effects of neuronal cell transplantation on GDNF‐rich scaffolds, which enhance survival and functional recovery.\n69\n Although the primary goal of utilizing nanoparticles is often to increase cell survival, therapeutic molecules can also be utilized to improve other features, such as angiogenesis by introducing, for example, VEGF in the wounded site.\n70\n, \n71",
        "Injectable hydrogels extensively used in brain injury research are classified into natural injectable hydrogels, synthetic hydrogels and self‐assembled or mixed hydrogels. Each category possesses unique attributes that make them suitable for specific applications. They differ in terms of their composition, origin, properties, and applications that are well‐discussed within this review.",
        "Natural injectable hydrogels, derived from biocompatible materials like cellulose, hyaluronic acid, collagen, chitosan, and others closely mimic the native CNS extracellular matrix. Their inherent biocompatibility and biodegradability make them an attractive choice for CNS repair. These hydrogels foster neural regeneration by creating a conducive microenvironment, promoting cell adhesion, and minimizing immune responses. The most commonly used natural hydrogel materials in tissue engineering are based on the natural components of ECM, such as cellulose, hyaluronic acid, chitosan, collagen, alginate, and gelatin,\n72\n, \n73\n which are discussed in detail below.",
        "Aside from its low immunogenicity and 3D structure, native ECM hydrogels have a multitude of biomolecules, including cytokines and chemical substances that stimulate cell growth and differentiation.\n49\n, \n74\n ECM is generally digested with pepsin and decellularized to prepare injectable ECM. Materials for preparing ECM hydrogels fall under two categories, namely, (a) nerve tissues and (b) non‐nerve tissues.\n50\n, \n75\n A study by Ghuman et al.\n76\n developed an injectable fluid by preparing ECM from pig bladder, exposing it to 4% ethanol, decellularizing it with 0.1% acetic acid, and lysing it with pepsin at a temperature of 21°C. The biodegradation rate of ECM hydrogels, the degree to which endogenous cells and nerve cells penetrated the materials, and the degree to which tissues were modified around the apoplexy cavity were determined by injecting different concentrations of the hydrogels into apoplexy rats' brains. The results of these studies indicate that injectable ECM hydrogels in the dosage of 4 mg/ml can result in maximum tissue regeneration in the brain. After 14 days of implantation, 80% of the ECM hydrogels degraded at a rate of 6.11 litres per day. There was a steady infiltration level of macrophages in the hydrogels that could be maintained at 700–800 cells/μL. It has been reported that the remaining hydrogels became denser with mature nerve cells after 90 days of injection which is a sign of tissue transformation and regeneration.\n76\n Such hydrogels functions as a supportive scaffold when injected into damaged neural tissue, providing a conducive microenvironment for cell attachment, proliferation, and survival. This biomimetic platform promotes neuroplasticity, aids axonal regeneration by guiding nerve fibers,\n74\n modulates immune responses to curb excessive inflammation, and can deliver bioactive molecules to facilitate tissue healing. Through these mechanisms, injectable ECM holds potential for ameliorating debilitating neurological conditions by promoting repair and functional recovery within the nervous system.\n49\n, \n50",
        "The polysaccharide HA is highly aqueous with repeated and alternate disaccharide units, mostly located in the brain and the ECM.\n77\n, \n78\n The biocompatibility and biodegradability of HA makes it ideal for use as a base for the development of new biologics. Additionally, it is used for cell transplantation, or it can be used on its own as a biological scaffold.\n51\n It exerts potential neuroprotective effects by modulating neuroinflammation and promoting tissue repair. Through interactions with CD44 receptors, HA regulates immune responses and dampens inflammation, thus reducing neuronal damage. Moreover, the viscoelastic properties of HA can contribute to tissue restoration by providing structural support and promoting cellular regeneration in debilitating neurological conditions.\n51\n, \n78\n Studies have prepared HA‐based hydrogels by crosslinking MMPase peptides with acrylate and adding HA to the main chain. It is possible to mimic brain mechanical properties by varying the cross‐linking agents.\n52\n According to a study, human pluripotent stem cells injected into stroke mice stimulated differentiation of the cells, but after 1 week, the hydrogels failed to improve the survival of stem cells.\n53\n In contrast, in another study, HA hydrogels containing brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were injected into the cranial cavities of mice within a week of stroke. The group receiving HA hydrogels combined with BDNF resulted in a significantly higher number of new neurons in contrast to the control group following 9 weeks of stroke.\n54\n This suggested that HA hydrogels with BDNF significantly increased the number of new neurons in the brain.",
        "In addition to these pros, Ho et al.\n55\n reported that hyaluronic acid‐methylcellulose (HAMC) hydrogels, which are HA based physical cross‐linking hydrogels, cause severe damage to the CNS. It was reported that erythropoietin delivered via hydrogels to the cerebral cortex of stroke induced mice resulted in a significant increase in neurons, a decrease in inflammation, a reduction in stroke lumen size, and migratory neuroblast proliferation in the inferior ventricle.\n55",
        "Chitosan, a natural polymer mainly composed of d‐glucosamine and randomly linked β‐(1‐4) units of N‐acetyl‐d‐glucosamine, is recognized as the most abundant polysaccharide after cellulose for its biodegradability, biocompatibility, non‐allergenicity, non‐toxicity, resistance to oxidation, antibacterial and anti‐inflammatory properties.\n56\n It has shown potentials in mitigating debilitating neurological conditions through several mechanisms. Firstly, chitosan's positively charged amino groups can interact with negatively charged molecules, potentially reducing the aggregation of misfolded proteins implicated in neurological conditions like AD. Secondly, its anti‐inflammatory properties may modulate neuroinflammatory responses, offering neuroprotection. Lastly, chitosan‐based drug delivery systems could enhance the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents across the BBB, facilitating treatment strategies for neurological disorders.\n56\n, \n58\n However, for chitosan‐based biomaterials, functionalization is necessary to address its low solubility and poor mechanical properties. For instance, adding succinic or ferulic acid to chitosan hydrogels injection and administering it to Wistar rats demonstrated adequate biocompatibility. This suggests the potential application of functionalized chitosan hydrogels to treat CNS injuries.\n57\n Tseng and his colleagues in 2015 synthesized a self‐injectable chitosan‐based hydrogels that gelatinized slowly at room temperature but rapidly at body temperature (37°C). The hydrogels stimulated 38% neural regeneration in the zebrafish embryo model.\n58\n Yao and colleagues, by combining chitosan, beta‐glycerophosphate, hyaluronic acid and hydroxy cellulose developed a thermal hydrogel carrying human umbilical cord neural stem cells. This biocompatibility composite thermal hydrogel with optimum gelation rate secretes BDNF resulting in neuronal proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis process, facilitating survival and recovery in rat models.\n59",
        "Fibrin, a natural enzyme‐degrading protein synthesized by simply mixing thrombin with fibrinogen and involved in blood and lymph coagulation is highly biocompatible and biodegradable in nature.\n60\n Its ability to bind many proteins, cells, and ECMs makes it a flexible hydrogel.\n79\n Additionally, the ratio of fibrinogen and thrombin can be adjusted to match the mechanical properties of fibrin hydrogels with those of human spinal cord tissues. Furthermore, as per study, during in vivo degradation or polymerization, the released by‐products from the hydrogel also contribute to damage repair.\n79",
        "By the year 1998, the US‐FDA had approved fibrin tissue sealant for use in intraoperative hemostasis and wound healing.\n80\n By introducing ultrasound into a silk fibroin solution, some researchers developed a silk hydrogel based on fibrin. By controlling the time and intensity of ultrasound, brain compatibility was achieved. Experimental mice injected with this silk‐based fibrin hydrogel showed cell death and inflammation in the implanted area without any sensory, motor, or cognitive deficits, indicating its biosafety in the brain.\n81\n Further study has demonstrated that fibrin‐based biological scaffolds are capable of not only providing a sustaining environment for transplanted cells after a brain injury but also exerting neuronal antiapoptosis.\n82\n When used homologously, this hydrogel has been found to have complete biocompatibility based on current research. Neuronal differentiation could be enhanced by precisely controlling its mechanical properties by adjusting the ratio of fibrinogen to thrombin or by adding some other stable hydrogels.\n83\n In light of these characteristics, fibrin is an interesting tissue engineering candidate, however, fibrin hydrogel systems have been poorly utilized in brain research to date.",
        "Collagen, a natural hydrogel synthesized by hydrolysis of gelatin, has diverse applications in medical science such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, bone reconstruction, dressing of wounds and various cell encapsulation systems. Depending upon applicability, it can be shaped from films and shields to nanoparticles, sponges and gels.\n84\n, \n85\n While there are 29 types of collagen, only type I and type IV collagen are abundant and most widely used.\n86\n Type IV collagen plays an important role in the formation of neuromuscular junctions and the basement membrane of the BBB within the nervous system. While type I collagen contributes to development of neurons, formation of dura mater, pia mater as well as growth of axons.\n87\n It has also gained immense attention for CNS repair owing to its biodegradability, biocompatibility, versatility, and nontoxicity and is considered a potential candidate for regeneration of brain tissues.\n85",
        "Based on applicability, collagen can be shaped to micro or nanospheres or injectable scaffolds to release drugs locally to protect neurons in neurodegenerative conditions like PD or AD and for encapsulating stem and genetically modified cells for its safer delivery. Further, collagen has immense application as filling agents in filling the voids caused by injuries where it provides structural support and a suitable microenvironment for the growth of axons.\n88\n Literature provides sufficient information regarding use of collagen hydrogels in brain tissue regeneration therapy. In the study by Guan and his colleagues, human bone marrow‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in combination with collagen hydrogel were injected into the injury site of experimental rats.\n89\n Results showed that the combination of collagen hydrogel with hMSCs is therapeutically more promising as compared to the hMSCs alone. In the presence of collagen hydrogels, the proliferation of hMSCs to specific organs was enhanced while inhibiting proliferation to nonspecific organs and supporting cell differentiation and growth. This resulted in enhanced brain metabolism and restoration of its function. In another study, rat NSCs were injected in healthy rats by suspending in collagen hydrogel solution.\n90\n The stem cells displayed excellent viability in the hydrogel and could be reabsorbed after 15 days which suggests biodegradability of the collagen hydrogel.",
        "Hoban et al. used collagen (type I) as vectors to deliver glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factors (GDNF) to the brain via transgenic bone marine‐derived MSCs for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. As a result of the study, hydrogel reduced both astrocyte recruitment and responses of microglial cells without affecting cell survival or GDNF secretion.\n91\n These studies suggest that injectable collagen hydrogels have great potentials as a treatment for TBI and other nerve injury repair strategies. The applications and specific‐characteristics of these natural hydrogels are listed in Table 2.",

        "These hydrogels are artificially synthesized in a laboratory using chemical processes. They are composed of synthetic polymers or materials that are not naturally occurring, however it present opportunities for precise customization of properties. While modifications may be needed for optimal biocompatibility, their versatility in mechanical attributes is particularly advantageous.\n95\n, \n96\n, \n97\n These hydrogels predominantly comprise polyacrylamide (PAM) and PEG as their base materials. In contrast to naturally occurring hydrogels, these hydrogels exhibit comparatively inferior physical characteristics and are more prone to inducing inflammatory responses following in vivo administration.\n95\n They hold promise in mitigating debilitating neurological conditions through multifaceted mechanisms. These hydrogels, when injected into the affected area, can provide a supportive three‐dimensional matrix that promotes cell survival and tissue regeneration.\n95\n Moreover, their tunable properties enable controlled release of therapeutic agents, such as neurotrophic factors or drugs, facilitating localized treatment and fostering neural recovery.\n95\n, \n97\n In an in vivo investigation conducted by Tamariz et al.,\n96\n PEG‐Si, a thixotropic hydrogel containing irradiation silica nanoparticles, was intracranially administered into the striatum of rats, while a sterile saline solution was injected into the corresponding cerebral hemisphere as a control. After a duration of 30 days, notable substantiation and astrocolloid reactions were observed specifically in the hemisphere where the polymer hydrogel was introduced. In 2008, Bjugstad et al.,\n97\n conducted a study involving the implantation of PEG‐based hydrogels into the striatum and frontal cortex regions of primates. The hydrogel formation involved the photocrosslinking of a PLA‐B‐PEG‐B‐PLA triblock polymer using a methacrylate group. In one hemisphere of the grivet brain, the hydrogels were injected, while the contralateral hemisphere received a needle injection without the hydrogels, serving as the sham‐implantation group. A third grivet received bilateral injections of PEG‐GDNF. The complete degradation of all hydrogels was observed after a 4‐month period. A PEG hydrogel concentration of 13% w/v induced minimal infiltration of astrocytes and microglia, which was comparable to that observed in the sham‐implantation group. Conversely, a marginal increment in the glial response was observed when utilizing 20% w/v PEG hydrogels incorporated with GDNF, thereby suggesting that PEG‐based hydrogels persist in their capacity as a viable drug delivery system with promising prospects, even subsequent to modifications.\n97",
        "Self‐assembled hydrogels represent a three‐dimensional framework composed of polymeric substances that undergo self‐assembly through either physical or chemical crosslinking mechanisms. They may incorporate both natural and synthetic components depending on the design. These materials exhibit exceptional attributes such as remarkable biocompatibility, biodegradability, and responsiveness to physiological stimuli, thereby rendering them highly suitable for applications in tissue culture, drug delivery systems, and the fabrication of implanted sensors for human use. Furthermore, the versatile bonding interactions between the polymeric chains and water molecules, along with their capacity for chelating metal ions, expand their potential applications in fields such as photovoltaics and optics.\n98\n The biocompatibility of self‐assembled hydrogels is attributed to some extent to their composition, which generally includes biological or bio‐inspired molecules such as proteins, peptides, amino acids, carbohydrates, therapeutic agents, and oligonucleotides.\n99\n Such hydrogels are generated through the spontaneous self‐assembly of monomeric constituents, leading to the formation of polymer‐like fibrils through noncovalent interactions. The entanglement of these fibrils further results in the formation of an extensive network, inducing gelation of the surrounding aqueous solvent. Self‐assembled hydrogels have demonstrated distinct advantages over covalently bonded hydrogels, making them desirable for applications in the biomedical domain.\n99\n The versatility and biomimetic nature of self‐assembling peptides (SAPs) render them an optimal choice for addressing the intricate and sensitive environment associated with neural tissue damage. In addition to the finely tailored properties of these hydrogels, which strive to emulate healthy physiological tissue, the use of a minimally invasive delivery approach becomes crucial to mitigate off‐target effects and complications arising from surgical interventions. SAPs, belonging to the class of injectable hydrogels, are characterized by short, repetitive amino acid units and modified polar and nonpolar residues, enabling them to form a double‐β‐sheet structure upon dissolution in water.\n100\n This structural arrangement facilitates sol‐gel transition without the need for toxic cross‐linking agents or chemical additives, thereby exhibiting inherent biocompatibility. SAPs provide a favorable combination of in situ polymerization, adaptability for biofunctionalization, the capability to finely adjust physicochemical characteristics, and remarkable compatibility with living cells.\n101\n Guo et al. conducted an experiment wherein an ionic complementary hydrogel, namely RADA16, was implanted into the lesion cavities of rats with surgically induced TBI. The objective was to evaluate its potential for reconstructing the damaged cortex. Remarkably, RADA16 exhibited successful integration with the host tissue and resulted in a significant reduction in the size of the lesion cavity after a six‐week period. Furthermore, researchers observed a notable decrease in pathological glial hyperplasia and an attenuated inflammatory response.\n102\n In another study, SAP hydrogels demonstrated the capability to deliver exogenous stem cells into the brain. To achieve this, researchers modified RADA16 by attaching an adhesion motif called IKVAV, derived from laminin, and encapsulated NSCs within the modified hydrogels. Subsequently, this combination was transplanted into rats with neocortical damage caused by a perforated biopsy. After 6 weeks, the encapsulated NSCs proliferated and differentiated into neurons, as evidenced by an increase in the expression of mature neuronal markers such as β‐tubulin and microtubule‐associated protein 2 (MAP2), compared to the use of cell therapy alone. Moreover, there was an observed increase in the levels of Synapsin‐1, a potential marker of synaptic formation.\n103\n Additionally, several experiments have demonstrated the ability of SAPs to transport drugs, biological agents, and other therapeutic substances into the damaged brain cavity, thereby improving treatment efficacy while maintaining favorable biocompatibility.\n104\n, \n105",
        "Injectable hydrogels intended for CNS regeneration must exhibit biocompatibility, non‐immunogenicity, and a lack of detrimental effects on human cells and tissues.\n106\n Furthermore, these hydrogels should promote axonal growth and elongation while gradually degrading over time, eliminating the need for additional surgical procedures to remove the scaffold.\n107\n, \n108\n The mechanical characteristics, encompassing stiffness and surface topography of the scaffolds, are pivotal factors in their biomaterial design. Studies have revealed that even small variations in mechanical and topographical features can profoundly influence cell fate, attachment, polarity, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival.\n109\n In the context of neural tissue engineering, scaffolds must be able to withstand the stresses exerted by the surrounding tissues.\n108\n Thus, before injection, the hydrogels should possess a lower elastic modulus than their storage modulus, while after injection, they should transit to a state where the storage modulus exceeds the elastic modulus, resulting in the formation of a soft and cohesive solid that can withstand the pressure from the surrounding tissues.\n110",
        "The swelling ratio and degradation rate of biomaterials are influenced by various factors, including the type of polymer, chemical and mechanical properties of the biomaterial, and the presence of enzymes at the injury site. For effective CNS regeneration, hydrogels should degrade slowly and exhibit minimal swelling. The degradation rate of the biomaterial should strike a balance between early degradation, which could impact glial scarring, cause additional inflammation, and inhibit axon elongation, and late degradation, which could facilitate new tissue generation and prevent long‐distance axonal regeneration.\n110\n Excessive hydrogel degradation before neural regeneration can result in swelling and a loss of mechanical injury.\n111\n, \n112\n Additionally, the porosity of scaffolds, as well as the diameter and interconnectivity of pores, are crucial for proper nutrient and biological molecular diffusion, waste elimination, cell attachment, and tissue growth.\n113\n High swelling ratios can lead to hydrogel deformation, occlusion of the defect, and inhibition of neurite development.\n114\n The incorporation of hydrophilic or electrostatically charged moieties in hydrogels can increase swelling, but it may also enhance network permeability and significantly affect hydrogel biomechanics. In the context of subdural injection of hydrogels after spinal cord or traumatic brain injuries, maximal swelling can aid in the removal of excess fluid from the parenchyma, thus preventing further inquiry.\n115\n It is worth noting that pre‐swelling of micro‐particle‐based hydrogels\n116\n and shape‐memory hydrogels before in vivo delivery may cause tissue damage similar to in situ swelling pressures. Moreover, increasing macromere content or crosslinking density can reduce water uptake of hydrogels, but this may compromise mechanical strength and permeability, leading to potential issues and adverse consequences.\n117",
        "Another critical characteristic of injectable hydrogels is their solidification conditions, which should minimize tissue and cell damage, allowing solidification to occur under mild circumstances.\n117\n The initial velocity of the hydrogel and various environmental parameters, including crosslinker, pH, light, and temperature that influence solidification are of great importance. These parameters must be biocompatible and enable the hydrogel to undergo gelation within seconds to minutes of injection.\n117\n The gelation time of injectable hydrogels is a crucial consideration. Adequate gelation time is essential to mitigate the risk of injection needle occlusion and facilitate the interaction between the spared spinal cord tissue and the hydrogel solution before gelation. Further research is warranted to establish the optimal gelation times for diverse types of injectable hydrogels.\n118",
        "Designing biomaterials for brain repair presents a range of challenges, as elucidated in recent scientific literature. Among these challenges, achieving optimal bioavailability and nonimmunogenicity of the employed biomaterials stands out prominently. Studies have emphasized the importance of selecting materials that do not elicit harmful immune response and are well‐tolerated by brain tissue.\n119\n, \n120",
        "Another challenge is promoting appropriate cellular interactions and tissue integration. Recent research has focused on developing biomaterials that can stimulate axonal growth, guide neuronal migration, and support the formation of functional neural networks.\n121\n, \n122\n Furthermore, achieving controlled degradation rates and avoiding excessive swelling is crucial for biomaterials intended for brain repair. Recent studies have investigated strategies to optimize the degradation kinetics of biomaterials to match the regenerative timeline of brain tissue and prevent adverse reactions such as glial scarring.\n123\n, \n124",
        "In addition, the mechanical properties of biomaterials play a crucial role in their design. Recent literature has emphasized the need to tailor the stiffness, elasticity, and viscoelastic properties of biomaterials to mimic the mechanical properties of native brain tissue, providing appropriate mechanical support and minimizing tissue damage.\n125\n, \n126\n, \n127",
        "Moreover, the ability to deliver therapeutic agents, such as growth factors or drugs, within the biomaterial matrix is an ongoing challenge. Recent studies have explored various approaches, including the incorporation of drug‐release particles or the functionalization of biomaterials with bioactive molecules, to enable controlled and localized delivery of therapeutic factors.\n128\n, \n129",
        "Overall, recent scientific literature underscores the challenges associated with designing biomaterials for brain repair, highlighting the need for further research and innovation in this field to develop effective strategies for neural regeneration and functional recovery.",
        "The intricate nature of the brain poses significant challenges in the development of effective treatment strategies. The failure to achieve successful drug treatments for neurological diseases has led to the emergence of alternative approaches, like cell‐based therapies, for brain healing and repair. The advent of biomaterials has profoundly revolutionized the potential of brain cell repair. The ability to design biomaterials‐based devices for localized delivery of cells and biomolecules in a minimally invasive manner has opened up intriguing possibilities for targeting neuroprotection and neuroregeneration, overcoming the limitations associated with conventional drug delivery methods for brain therapeutics. It is evident that we are entering an era of specialized and rational biomaterial design to address CNS injuries, with exhaustive investigations conducted for each specific condition to optimize the development of biomaterial‐based therapies. Traditional implanted hydrogels are no longer adequate for meeting the requirements of contemporary treatments. Injectable hydrogels have the ability to undergo sol–gel transition in vitro and in vivo. Precise injection of hydrogels, along with the necessary cells and drugs, into the lesion site using a fine needle, followed by in vivo gelation at an appropriate rate within the lesion cavity, holds the potential to minimize the cavity, promote nerve tissue regeneration, and reduce inflammation. However, the unstable and imprecise introduction of hydrogels into the body poses risks due to the demanding technical requirements associated with brain injection and the lack of reported procedures. Moreover, the understanding of the mechanism underlying nerve tissue growth stimulation remains insufficient. Therefore, in addition to encouraging continued research on the structure and properties of hydrogels, further investigations should prioritize elucidating the mechanism governing tissue responses to enhance functional recovery after hydrogel implantation. Ongoing research endeavors provide hope for the design of highly efficient injectable hydrogels for repairing brain damage.",

        "The alveolar bone, which secures teeth in the jaw, can undergo resorption following tooth extraction due to the lack of mechanical load [1,2]. The regeneration of alveolar bone, as opposed to skeletal bone, poses unique clinical challenges. While autologous bone grafts are considered the “gold standard” for significant alveolar bone defects [3], they come with drawbacks such as donor site morbidity, deformity, potential infection, and the risk of graft rejection. Consequently, research in material science and tissue engineering is focused on finding suitable materials and their fabrication for the replacement and reconstruction of alveolar bone [4]. BTE focuses on crucial processes involving cell growth and the complex structure of human bone at both microscopic (biomineralisation) and macroscopic (ossification) scales [5].",
        "Numerous methods have been explored to halt the resorption of the alveolar process [6], and research on various strategies for reconstructing alveolar bone defects is rapidly expanding. However, the included studies exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity [7], necessitating the establishment of a unified standard for bone regeneration in the alveolar process [8]. The advancement of medical science, particularly in implantology, relies on the development of a robust research methodology that enables a legitimate transition from correlational conclusions to causative ones, thereby minimising potential errors before clinical trials. As an interdisciplinary field, BTE combines osteoconductive scaffolds, osteogenic cells, growth factors, and their interrelationships within the natural microenvironment [9]. An integrated methodological approach is proposed to optimise scaffold characteristics, grounded in interdisciplinary research encompassing regenerative medicine, materials, tissue, and dental engineering. Although many phenomena in nature are exceptionally complicated and challenging to replicate, BTE employs a biomimetic approach. This approach provides unique and innovative solutions, offering one strategy to individual fields [10].",
        "Among the promising strategies in this area, the employment of scaffolds fabricated via 3D printing techniques stands out. One such technique is FFF, also known as fused deposition modelling (FDM) [11,12]. Other methods include PolyJet, selective laser sintering (SLS), digital light processing (DLP), stereolithography (SLA), and bioprinting [13]. In comparing FFF with these alternatives, it is valuable to consider various aspects such as cost, materials employed, adaptability of the technique to the structure of the model produced, and the safety associated with the technique’s use [14,15,16].",
        "The PolyJet 3D printing technique [13] utilises photopolymerisation, utilising resin streams for construction. In contrast, SLS [17,18] uses a laser to sinter polymer powders, which facilitates the production of complex geometries that may be more difficult to realise with other methods. DLP [19] cures resins using light and can deliver rapid printing times. SLA [20] is distinguished by its high resolution and ability to fabricate intricate structures precisely. Bioprinting, a specialised subset of 3D printing technology, is engineered to construct biological structures encompassing tissues and organs [21].",
        "While each technique mentioned above possesses distinct advantages, FFF is particularly notable for its cost-effectiveness—it is comparatively economical, enhancing its accessibility [22]. It also supports a wide selection of biocompatible materials, including various biodegradable polymers, which are increasingly relevant in BTE. Furthermore, FFF offers versatility to accommodate specific user needs, allowing for the straightforward customisation of designs without significantly impacting production costs [23]. FFF printers are generally simpler to construct than their counterparts in the 3D printing domain. For instance, the absence of laser radiation or ultraviolet (UV) light in FFF enhances user safety, positioning this technology as a viable option for industrial upscaling within BTE contexts. The inherent simplicity and flexibility of FFF technology make it an exemplary candidate for manufacturing processes aligned with the principles of lean manufacturing and rapid prototyping.",
        "The FFF technology involves the layer-by-layer deposition of fused material to construct a 3D object. This process initiates with the generation of a 3D computer model, which is subsequently ‘sliced’ into thin cross-sections utilising specialised slicing software. This software delineates the pathways for the print head to follow and sets various printing parameters, including temperatures, speeds, and infill patterns. The print head, or extruder, is heated to a predetermined temperature, facilitating the melting of the filament. This filament, a strand of thermoplastic material typically measuring 1.75 ± 0.15 mm in diameter, is directed into the heated extruder [16]. Within the extruder, the material liquefies and is extruded through a narrow nozzle, generally 0.4 mm in diameter [24], onto the build platform. The extruder traverses the preordained paths, laying the material in successive layers. Upon completion of a layer, the build platform descends (or the extruder ascends, contingent upon the printer design), and the process iterates for the subsequent layer. The newly deposited material cools and solidifies, bonding with the layer beneath it. After the printing concludes, the final object is meticulously detached from the build platform [13].",
        "Currently, two significant bottlenecks are identifiable within the context of BTE concerning FFF. The first involves the processing of the filament to ensure it satisfies the requisite material specifications. The second entails the fine-tuning of printing parameters to achieve a scaffold with properties that are appropriately tailored for BTE.",
        "A scaffold, which imitates the bone tissue structure, can minimise the risk of rejection by the body and foster bone regeneration [25]. Three-dimensional printing enables the precise and controlled fabrication of personalised spatial structures with complex geometries, adaptable to the anatomical shapes of the alveolar bone [26,27]. One of the most promising materials is PCL [28], mainly due to a suite of properties that set it apart from other synthetic polyesters, such as polyglycolic acid (PGA), polylactic acid (PLA), and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) [29].",
        "PGA is a bioresorbable, aliphatic polyester frequently utilised in the medical domain, especially for surgical sutures, owing to its high tensile strength and degradability [30]. PGA scaffolds have been employed in BTE on account of their mechanical attributes. Nevertheless, PGA undergoes rapid degradation and generates acidic by-products, which could affect the local cellular milieu and impede tissue regeneration.",
        "PLA is another aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources like cornstarch or sugarcane. Besides its widespread use in biodegradable packaging, PLA is employed in the medical field for sutures, drug delivery systems, and tissue engineering scaffolds [31]. However, similar to PGA, the degradation of PLA can lead to acidic by-products, potentially affecting the cellular environment.",
        "PLGA is a copolymer of PLA and PGA that combines the properties of both polymers. Its versatility, evidenced by its tunable degradation rates and mechanical properties, makes it a preferred choice for drug delivery and tissue engineering. PLGA scaffolds can offer intermediate degradation rates between PLA and PGA while maintaining sufficient mechanical strength [32]. However, as with its parent polymers, the degradation by-products can influence the pH of the local environment, which might necessitate careful consideration during scaffold design and application.",
        "In the realm of BTE, the choice between PGA, PLA, and PLGA often hinges on the specific requirements of the application, including the desired degradation rate, mechanical properties, and biological response of the surrounding tissue. PCL offers advantages that address some of the limitations inherent in the polymers mentioned above.",
        "In BTE, one pivotal consideration is the processing properties of PCL, which include a low melting point (approx. 60 °C) [33]. Additionally, PCL’s flexibility, attributable to its low glass transition temperature (approx. −60 °C) [34], along with its thermoplasticity, renders it more amenable to being shaped into various forms when compared to the relatively more brittle PLA. Moreover, the balance between stiffness and flexibility in PCL can be modulated [10,28], enhancing its versatility. It readily blends with other polymers or ceramics to form copolymers or composites, thereby facilitating the fabrication of scaffolds with properties that are optimally tailored for bone tissue regeneration.",
        "The second pivotal consideration is scaffold longevity within the body, referring to structural and mechanical integrity. While PGA, PLA, and PLGA present distinct advantages, they typically degrade more rapidly than PCL. The slower degradation rate of PCL [28] is particularly advantageous in BTE, as it ensures the scaffold remains intact, providing consistent mechanical support throughout the development and maturation of bone tissue.",
        "Currently, two limitations of PCL scaffolds are noted. One involves carrying out an appropriate compatibilisation strategy to strengthen the surface to hydrophilic properties. Hydrophilisation is correlated with facilitating cell anchoring and adhering. The second involves the adaptation of the degradation rate of material to the remodelling of bone tissue. However, due to PCL’s degradation rate and surface properties, its sole use might not adequately stimulate regenerative processes in bone tissue. Therefore, the introduction of ceramics and natural polymers [35] into the 3D scaffold presents a solution since these materials have high bioactive potential.",
        "The incorporation of ceramic materials into the PCL matrix permits the regulation of both degradation and resorption rates. Their bioactivity is unmatched, enhancing the interaction with bone cells. In accordance with the biomimetic approach, HA is identified as a promising material owing to its structural congruence with bone tissue. Other materials, such as β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) [36], bioactive glass, and silica-based ceramics, also promote the formation of bone tissue; however, their bioactivity is somewhat inferior compared to HA. Furthermore, their biodegradation rates and biocompatibility are less optimally adaptable to specific requirements than those of HA.",
        "In the biomimetic approach to BTE, CGI and CS are deemed appropriate materials. CGI, in conjunction with HA—the quintessential organic and inorganic components of bone tissue—plays a pivotal role in biomimetic mineralisation [37]. Together, they replicate the natural microstructural matrix, providing an optimal environment for tissue regeneration. CS, a natural polysaccharide within the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) family, also demonstrates significant bioactive potential [38,39,40]. Renowned for its biocompatibility, capacity to promote cell growth, and ability to inhibit bacterial proliferation, CS facilitates the biomimetic mineralisation process, which involves the synthesis of mineral substances similar to those in natural bone tissue [41]. Compared to other natural polymers, CS has distinct advantages:It exhibits superior mechanical properties and a more streamlined purification process than silk fibroin [42].Its production is less costly and arises from more diverse sources than hyaluronic acid [43].CS surpasses bacterial cellulose in biodegradation within physiological environments and demonstrates enhanced osseointegration [44].",
        "It exhibits superior mechanical properties and a more streamlined purification process than silk fibroin [42].",
        "Its production is less costly and arises from more diverse sources than hyaluronic acid [43].",
        "CS surpasses bacterial cellulose in biodegradation within physiological environments and demonstrates enhanced osseointegration [44].",
        "Utilising a 3D scaffold comprising PCL, HA, CGI, and CS can establish a biomimetic environment that triggers regenerative processes at the alveolar bone defect site [45,46]. The scaffold’s structure allows the adhesion of bone cells, providing mechanical support, while CGI and CS act as active ingredients stimulating osteoblasts’ anchoring, proliferation, and differentiation [47,48]. Through the synergy of these components, the PCL-based 3D scaffold can accelerate the regeneration process, leading to bone mineralisation at the defect site. This approach paves the way for practical BTE by establishing a biomimetic environment conducive to restoring the structure and function of bone tissue in a manner harmonious with the body’s biology, thereby leading to improved therapeutic results.",
        "This review outlines the main challenges in designing osteoconductive scaffolds with osteoinductive potential for alveolar bone engineering. Emphasis is placed on understanding processes such as biomineralisation and ossification. Through a biomimetic approach, we examine a range of properties that these scaffolds should possess (Figure 1). Given that reviewing processing conditions and structural, mechanical, degradation, and surface properties is complex and subject to debate, we focus on discussing and identifying research gaps.",
        "The alveolar bone is unique due to its embryonic cellular origin, specific ossification process, and connection to teeth via periodontal tissues. This bone plays a pivotal role in safely anchoring teeth, enabling them to withstand the forces generated during chewing and biting (mechanical function) [6,8]. Additionally, the alveolar bone contributes to maintaining the shape of the mouth by connecting the tooth root with surrounding bone tissue (stabilisation function) [49]. This linkage secures the tooth’s position and reduces the risk of tooth loss due to periodontal disease or other oral health issues [50].",
        "Moreover, the alveolar bone plays a significant role in tooth development. As the teeth evolve, the bone grows and reshapes to accommodate the emerging tooth. The alveolar bone also aids in maintaining teeth alignment posteruption, regulating the movement and positioning of periodontal ligaments [51].",
        "Understanding the unique function and structure of the alveolar bone can significantly contribute to maintaining oral homeostasis, which is a balance between the resorption and formation of bone [6]. Bone tissue homeostasis is strongly related to the balanced activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone formation and resorption, respectively. Moreover, osteocytes play a pivotal role in regulating both of these processes [8,52]. These cells interact through mechano-biochemical signals with each other to regulate the processes of bone formation and resorption, which is crucial for bone homeostasis (Figure 2) [6,53].",
        "Thus, the amount of bone tissue resorbed by osteoclasts is balanced by the amount of new bone formed by osteoblasts, ensuring that the net bone mass remains constant (coupling system). However, this equilibrium is disrupted following tooth extraction or during the early healing phase of severe periodontitis, resulting in excessive osteoclastic bone resorption—a primary characteristic of jawbone disease. The ultimate consequence of the alveolar bone’s physiological remodelling is localised loss [6,53].",
        "Therefore, all processes, including the ossification of the alveolar bone, are integral to oral health and development. This diverse jaw structure’s morphological and mechanical features necessitate innovative therapeutic approaches [54].",
        "Scheme of osteocyte–osteoblast–osteoclast interactions enclosed in coupling system. (I) Osteocyte–osteoblast interactions: osteocytes possess the ability to detect mechanical loads on bone. When a bone is loaded, osteocytes convert this load into biochemical signals. Subsequently, osteocytes can release factors, such as prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO), which modulate osteoblast activity. Through this mechanism, osteocytes promote the activation of osteoblasts to form new bone in response to loading. (II) Osteoblast–osteoclast interactions: osteoblasts produce and release factors such as RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor ϰ-B ligand) and M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulating factor). RANKL binds to the RANK receptor on the surface of osteoclast precursors, leading to their differentiation into fully active osteoclasts. Additionally, osteoblasts produce osteoprotegerin (OPG), which serves as a ‘trap’ for RANKL, inhibiting osteoclast activation. The balance between RANKL and OPG in the bone microenvironment determines whether bone will be resorbed or formed. (III) Osteocyte–osteoclast interactions: osteocytes can also release RANKL, influencing the activation of osteoclasts. Furthermore, osteocytes can secrete factors that inhibit osteoclast activity in response to mechanical loading [6,55,56,57].",
        "Ossification is the overarching process of bone formation. It predominantly results in the growth and repair of hard tissue at the macroscopic scale. Mimicking natural biological processes by inserting a PCL-based scaffold into an alveolar bone defect poses a significant challenge. The scaffold’s architecture is designed to provide stability and mechanical strength commensurate with bone tissue.",
        "Ossification primarily occurs through endochondral and intramembranous mechanisms [21,58]. Figure 3 offers a comparative overview of these processes. Alveolar bone ossification proceeds via the intramembranous mechanism [6,59]. From an engineering perspective, these two mechanisms exhibit several key distinctions.",
        "Firstly, endochondral ossification occurs within a pre-existing cartilaginous scaffold, which provides inherent mechanical stability during ossification and biodegrades as the bone tissue gains enough mechanical strength [60]. In contrast, intramembranous ossification directly occurs within connective tissue, lacking the mechanical robustness provided by a cartilaginous scaffold. This aspect makes the developing intramembranous ossification more vulnerable to external forces, potentially leading to deformities in the bone architecture [61].",
        "Secondly, the origins of osteoblasts, the cells responsible for bone formation, differ between the two processes. In endochondral ossification, osteoblasts initially form outside the cartilaginous scaffold, typically differentiating in the bone marrow [62]. These cells then migrate into the scaffold, where they proliferate and differentiate. Conversely, osteoblasts directly originate within the connective tissue in intramembranous ossification, differentiating from mesenchymal cells resembling primitive fibroblast precursors.",
        "Consequently, the two ossification processes significantly differ in their mechanisms, particularly regarding their mechanical implications and osteoblast formation [63]. It would be intriguing to hypothesise whether introducing a scaffold could alter the biological behaviour of the healing and ossification process.",
        "Understanding the ossification mechanism of the alveolar bone aligns with the biomimetic approach and aids in designing bone replacement material. The scaffold at the defect site should provide sufficient space for osteoblast development without creating a spatial barrier. One method to minimise this spatial barrier, thereby promoting the differentiation of osteoblasts (bone ossification) and fibroblasts (bone healing), is to enable the scaffold to transmit mechanical forces and convert them into a biochemical signal (mechanotransduction) [64].",
        "Bone mineralisation, a specific stage of ossification at the microscopic scale, involves the precipitation of calcium (Ca2+) and primarily monohydrogen phosphate (HPO42−, Pi) ions [65]. The typical biogenic mineral is hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HA), an inorganic component integral to bones and teeth [66]. Biomimetic mineralisation is a strategy that seeks to emulate natural mineralisation processes to create hydroxyapatite with a crystallographic structure that resembles bone apatite [67]. For instance, Cai et al. utilised X-ray spectroscopy to analyse the resulting materials. They found that the calcium-to-phosphorus (Ca/P) ratio of the synthesised hydroxyapatite (1.65) was similar to that of natural bone tissue (1.67) [68]. While the precise mechanism of biomineralisation remains controversial and not entirely understood due to limitations and gaps in comprehending this process in vivo [69], the control of hydroxyapatite (HA) crystallisation by an organic matrix, such as type I collagen (CGI), is common to all apatite-containing hard tissues [5,70].",
        "From a crystallisation standpoint, biomineralisation can be divided into two stages: the nucleation of calcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2, CaPi) (i) and the growth of its crystals in the form of apatite (ii) (Figure 4).",
        "HA nucleation occurs in matrix vesicles produced by osteoblasts and released into the extracellular matrix (ECM) [71]. Ca2+ is transported inside the vesicle by the Ca2+ pump, and Pi is converted from organic to inorganic by alkaline phosphatase. The matrix vesicle contains CGI, the matrix for CaPi precipitation. Thus, this process occurs at the interface of the inorganic–organic phase [72,73]. From a biochemical perspective, the precipitation behaviour of CaPi can be influenced by critical parameters, such as pH and the concentration of individual Ca2+ and Pi. Three variants are identified within the matrix vesicles, where a unique microenvironment prevails (Figure 5). In the first variant (pH equal to or lower than 6.2), biomineralisation does not occur, even if an appropriate concentration of Ca2+ and Pi ions is present in the matrix vesicles. Equilibrium is then established between the concentrations of monohydrogen phosphate (HPO42−, Pi) and dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4−) ions, where their concentration remains constant. In addition, HPO42− is condensed into pyrophosphate (HP2O74−, PPi) ions. The second variant occurs in a neutral or slightly alkaline environment (pH in the range of 7.0 to 7.2). Here, the precipitation process of Ca2+ and HPO42− occurs.",
        "Furthermore, the bicarbonate (HCO3−) ions are enzymatically degraded to carbon dioxide (CO2) and the hydroxyl anion (OH−). It can be hypothesised that CO2 contributes to the rupture of the matrix vesicle, and the OH− is incorporated into the apatite structure, forming HA. The third variant (pH in the range of 6.2 to 7), which is most characteristic of bone, involves HCO3− not being fully decomposed and incorporated into the apatite structure [74]. Consequently, hydroxyapatite in bones, typically doped with bicarbonate (so-called bone apatite), is characterised by easier solubility, facilitating dynamic bone remodelling [75,76].",
        "Crystal growth primarily occurs after the matrix vesicle opens. The standard size of the basal unit of bone apatite is 30–50 nm (length), 15–30 nm (width), and 2–10 nm (thickness) [77], exhibiting a rodlike or platelike microstructure, and is embedded in collagen fibres [78]. Bone apatite constitutes approximately 50 vol.% of the mature bone. The specific microstructural organisation of bone is age-dependent and varies among different bones and within different locations of the same bone [79]. HA crystals are deposited on collagen fibrils in intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar spaces [37,74]. HA crystal growth is regulated by noncollagenous proteins such as osteocalcin and SIBLING [80].",
        "In addition, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) also appear to be indirectly involved in HA crystal growth [81,82]. Many studies on bone mineralisation focus on the role of CGI and cells such as osteoblasts and osteoclasts, which may draw attention away from the functions of GAGs. Properties of GAGs, such as their ability to bind and hold water protection against mechanical stresses or interactions with proteins and minerals [83,84], may play pivotal roles in HA crystal growth. Therefore, further research is necessary to understand these processes better.",
        "GAGs, soft and hard tissue ECM components, are highly anionic straight-chain polysaccharides composed of repeating disaccharide units. Each unit consists of amino sugar and uronic acid. GAGs in bones play a vital role in transmitting mechanical forces. Their structure enables them to absorb impact energy, reduce the risk of injury, and contribute to bone toughness by retaining bound water in a bone mineral matrix [85]. The GAGs align specifically with the CGI, increasing the ordering of the CGI fibrils in the direction of mechanical force transmission [83,84]. On the other hand, too high accumulation of GAGs in cartilage and bone tissues leads to progressive cartilage damage, reducing bone growth [86,87].",
        "The primary component of the GAGs fraction in alveolar bone is chondroitin sulphate (ChS) [88,89]. ChS was first extracted from cartilage tissue. However, it is essential to note that interactions between ChS and type II collagen (CGII)—primarily found in cartilaginous tissue—may differ from interactions between ChS and CGI, which predominate in alveolar bone tissue. Although present in lesser amounts in bone than in cartilaginous tissue, ChS indirectly contributes to biomineralisation. Due to its chemical structure, ChS attracts Ca2+ and Pi ions deposited on collagen fibres to form the bone mineral unit [90,91]. ChS also provides chemical protection; its presence can prevent CGI from acidic denaturation even at low pH levels during inflammation [92]. Furthermore, ChS plays a pivotal role in controlling the shape, size, and number of apatite crystals, promoting the intrafibrillar growth of HA crystals [90,91]. It also enhances bone elasticity, although it may be presumed that this occurs in a manner distinct from that in cartilaginous tissue areas.",
        "Given the complexity of the nucleation and growth phenomena of HA crystals, the biomineralisation mechanism still needs to be fully understood. Therefore, two theories are proposed: classical and nonclassical [74].",
        "The classical theory of bone mineralisation suggests that the critical determinant is the occurrence of the substrate, specifically the collagen matrix [74]. Type I collagen (CGI), the most abundant protein in mammals, constitutes 25% (by dry weight) of all proteins. It is one of ten types of collagen, making up about 90 wt.% of all collagens [93]. This protein is expressed in the cells of the skin, ligaments, tendons (fibroblasts), cartilage (odontoblasts), and bone (osteoblasts), serving as the primary structural element in these tissues [94,95].",
        "The nonclassical theory of bone mineralisation posits that this process heavily relies on the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. According to this, the collagen matrix is not the only determining factor for biomineralisation; noncollagen proteins such as bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin, and SIBLING proteins [53,70,96,97], as well as polysaccharide compounds like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [83], are also significant contributors. This theory argues that noncollagen proteins are pivotal in controlling the shape and size of apatite crystals, leading to proper bone mineralisation. Furthermore, the nonclassical theory suggests that mechanical stresses can influence biomineralisation. These stresses potentially modulate the biochemical signal, adding another layer of complexity to our understanding of biomineralisation [98].",
        "Both theoretical viewpoints and the impact of mechanical stress should be considered in hard tissue engineering research designs to provide a comprehensive view of bone mineralisation.",
        "Currently, aliphatic polyester-based scaffolds are gaining popularity over human-origin living bone tissue surgically transplanted (autograft) [99]. Research in this field focuses on composite scaffolds based on PCL, with HA and natural polymers (such as CGI or CS) [100,101,102,103]. In contrast to autografts (see Figure 6), PCL-based scaffolds, supplemented with HA, CGI, and CS, provide more control over the structure, mechanical properties, and composition. For a scaffold to effectively foster the growth of new bone tissue in a defect, it must exhibit properties conducive to bone regeneration. These regenerative properties can be categorised into the following processes: osteoconduction, osteoinduction, osseointegration, and osteogenesis [104,105,106,107].",
        "Osteoconduction is the 3D process of ingrowth of capillaries, perivascular tissue, and osteoprogenitor cells from the bone bed into a structure of the porous implant. The main factor ensuring osteoconductivity is a complex interplay between the microarchitecture and surface of the scaffold and its material type. The microarchitecture (porosity, pore size, and shape) is said to ultimately determine the efficiency of new bone formation and its vascularisation [108]. Osteoconduction is the main driving force of bone regeneration in the case of a scaffold [109].",
        "Osseointegration is defined as a surface (2D) process in which the implant comes into direct contact with the bone and maintains it during functional loading. Its biological measure can be expressed as the percentage of bone in direct contact with the implant or the force needed to remove the implant from the bone. The main factor ensuring successful osseointegration is the determination of the appropriate macroarchitecture of an implant (i.e., its shape and hydrophilicity) [109,110,111,112].",
        "Osteoinduction is a characteristic process inside the scaffold that, via the presence of appropriate biologically active substances (vital proteins and growth factors), encourages the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and other osteoprogenitor cells into osteoblasts [83,84]. Moreover, according to Weber, osteoinductive factors are independent of osteoconduction that has occurred [109].",
        "Osteogenesis is the process by which osteoblasts in the scaffold produce minerals that calcify the collagen matrix (biomineralisation), creating a substrate for new bone formation (ossification) [113,114,115].",
        "Division of bone grafts according to their origin. An autograft is a tissue transferred from the same individual. It has been considered to be the standard of bone graft replacements. An allograft is a tissue transplanted within the same species, e.g., from one person to another. A xenograft is a tissue or organ that is derived from a species that is different from the recipient of the specimen. An alloplastic graft consists of synthetic biopolymers. It is synthetically derived or made from natural materials [116].",
        "Bone regeneration is a highly complex process. Oryan et al. assessed the bone repair effect of the (polylactide, PLA)/PCL/HA scaffold without loading it with differentiated bone cells. An in vivo analysis of this scaffold in rats confirmed that the bone tissue’s self-healing potential was not sustained even 80 days postinjury. However, adhesion of native HA particles was observed in several scaffold areas. This result suggests that HA generates a conducive environment for cells to attach and proliferate within the fabricated scaffold [117]. Therefore, a cell-free scaffold can support mild repair effects.",
        "Bone regeneration generally depends on the concurrent occurrence of the healing and ossification processes. Yu et al. studied in vivo the impact of a PCL/HA/CS scaffold loaded with osteogenic markers (e.g., BMP-2) and angiogenic markers (e.g., VEGF, PDGF) on bone regeneration in a rabbit model to achieve a pronounced therapeutic effect. These markers stimulate the differentiation of bone and epithelial tissue, respectively. It appears that both BMP-2 and VEGF mutually enhance the fracture regeneration process [45], which results in a notable improvement in new bone formation. However, regenerating the alveolar bone after tooth extraction remains a significant challenge [118]. Generally, healing and ossification are more cooperative and sequential stages.",
        "In the case of alveolar bone, the inflammatory reaction that starts healing induces significant bone resorption. Although this phenomenon is temporary, it substantially reduces bone volume. Naik et al. conducted clinical trials utilising PCL-based scaffolds inspired by results previously documented in animal studies and performed augmentation of intraoral defects in a selected group of patients [119]. From the drawn conclusions, it can be inferred that the anatomical features of the sinus cavity play a crucial role in the success of local alveolar bone augmentation. New bone growth is observed when the graft material contacts the Schneiderian membranes, the floor, and the walls of the sinus without penetrating the delicate oral mucosa. Moreover, developing a method where the scaffold permits the migration of osteoblasts into the scaffold’s inside has a significant value.",
        "In bone tissue regeneration, numerous biological studies are conducted; for instance, the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of osteoblasts in the scaffold are examined. Ultimately, the repair effect of the alveolar bone is determined based on its volumetric growth [120]. Achieving an osteoconductive scaffold with osteoinductive potential involves developing scaffolds with desirable structural, mechanical, degradation, and surface properties to at least induce a mild repair effect on bone tissue. A mild repair effect on bone tissue suggests the potential for the inoculation of cells, markers, and growth factors into the scaffold’s internal environment. Only such a scaffold, combined with cell therapy, results in satisfactory regeneration of bone tissue [27].",
        "Furthermore, combining an osteoinductive strategy with a custom osteoconductive scaffold, identifying the limiting steps of biomineralisation and ossification mechanisms, and comparing the repair effect of the scaffold with a control group (autograft) will provide more reliable results. Despite many constraints, PCL-based composite scaffolds extruded from filament exhibit significant potential for BTE applications [121]. As the electrospun PCL/HA scaffold has been demonstrated to be a robust material for repairing bone defects [122,123] and, when loaded with various drugs and metal particles [124], significantly promoting osteogenic activity, there is a reasonable expectation that the 3D printing method could yield equivalent or even more substantial results [125].",
        "PCL is a linear polyester (Figure 7) characterised by a slow degradation rate, which makes it suitable for potential load-bearing applications [126,127,128]. It has gained approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), enabling new solutions for surgical implant material and drug delivery devices for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications [129,130]. Consequently, its usage in fabricating 3D scaffolds for bone engineering has increased. The advantages of PCL include high flexibility and elongation [131], satisfactory biocompatibility, lower acidity of breakdown products compared to other polyesters, and significant load-carrying potential [132].",
        "However, the limitations of pure PCL are worth noting. Due to its poor hydrophilicity, it lacks the osteogenic potential to induce bone regeneration [133]. Therefore, researchers have been combining PCL with various polymers [134,135,136] and inorganic substances [137,138,139] to enhance the biomechanical properties of the scaffolds. The incorporation of bioactive inorganic particles, such as HA [100,103,140,141,142] and CS [143,144,145], into the PCL matrix offers a promising solution to overcome these drawbacks.",
        "The crystalline phases of CaPi exhibit good biocompatibility, which makes them promising materials for repairing hard tissue defects [146]. The most common biomineral CaPi crystal phase is hydroxyapatite ((HA); Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) (Figure 8), which is thermodynamically stable in body fluids [147]. HA has drawn researchers’ interest in recent years due to its porous structure, modification potential, biocompatibility, and bioactivity, the latter referring to its high osteogenic potential [139]. This characteristic greatly accelerates bone and tooth regeneration. Moreover, studies indicate that HA nanoparticles can effectively suppress the growth of various cancer cells [148,149,150]. Over the past decade, HA has gained widespread recognition as a biomedical material used in bone repair, metal implant coating, dental restoration, and drug delivery systems [151].",
        "The source of HA affects its chemical composition, structure, and properties [152]. Numerous methods have been developed to prepare HA. These techniques can be categorised into two groups: (i) biobased extraction methods, and (ii) synthetic methods, which include the hydrothermal method, chemical precipitation method, hydrolysis method, solid-state synthesis method, and sol-gel method [153].",
        "Synthetic HA is the most commonly used material. It is easily obtained from an aqueous solution via a simple coprecipitation method [154]. HA can be produced in various crystallographic forms by reaction between calcium and phosphate salts. A significant feature of HA is its ability to accommodate suitable ionic substitutions, thereby influencing its composition, structure, and solubility. Consequently, ions of similar or smaller size than Ca2+ (such as Fe2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+) can be incorporated into the HA crystal lattice with minimal impact on lattice parameters [155].",
        "It was also demonstrated that lanthanides such as Yb and Ho, which have ionic radii much larger than Ca2+, can enter the HA crystal lattice without significantly affecting its internal crystal structure [156]. Additionally, the incorporation of Si ions from metasilicate—which is generally absorbed and abundantly distributed in connective tissue—is significantly involved in bone regeneration [157,158]. Biologically synthesised HA created in a physiological environment typically contains various trace elements, including F, Si, Cu, Mg, Sr, Ag, Zn, and Fe, which aid bone regeneration [159,160].",
        "The introduction of necessary elements into the HA structure to enhance its biological activity is appealing due to its compact process and simple composition. However, the conclusions derived from research on HA biomineralisation require further clarification [161]. From an engineering standpoint, the main challenge is to obtain HA with an admixture of a specific element that facilitates a long-term and slow release of trace elements required by the body [162].",
        "Despite its many advantages, introduced HA remains a foreign substance to bone tissue. This is crucial because there are differences in the crystal structure, size, and stability between synthetic HA and in vivo mineralised HA [163]. On the other hand, synthetic HA with the same Ca/P ratio as bone minerals readily converts to bone apatite in vivo. The most limiting feature of HA from an engineering perspective is its high brittleness. To increase the mechanical strength and structure of the final scaffold, many researchers have introduced HA particles into the PCL matrix [117,164]. Ongoing research aims to achieve an evenly distributed high HA content, enabling the body to accept the bone graft material.",
        "One of the challenges in hard tissue engineering is the development of alternative sources of CGI as an initial-stage matrix of biomimetic mineralisation. Currently, CGI is obtained from the skin tissue of cows [165], rat tails [166], and fish [167]. Research is being conducted on using plant collagen in BTE. However, it still requires research and development of technology, in addition to plant collagen and the so-called recombinant collagen. Research is also being carried out to obtain synthetic collagen. This collagen is more accessible to manufacture and can be tailor-made for tissue engineering, but unfortunately, it is not as biocompatible as natural collagen. All of the above sources of CGI have their advantages and limitations. They require further research to provide a safe and effective replacement for natural collagen in bones [168].",
        "CGI, the primary organic component of bone ECM, has a complex structure comprising three hierarchical levels. The base level consists of a triplet of amino acids, primarily proline (Pro), hydroxyproline (Hyp), and glycine (Gly) [169]. These triplets of amino acids are arranged repeatedly to form a secondary structure [170]. The tertiary level is a triple helix formed from three interconnected chains (Figure 9). At the supramolecular level, collagen fibrils form fibres [171], which undergo self-assembly into a hydrogel network under appropriate physicochemical conditions [172].",
        "A systematic analysis of CGI’s primary amino acid sequence reveals a biomacromolecule enriched with charge. Recently, efforts to clarify the role of CGI molecules in mineral nucleation including performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [173,174]. Although most MD simulations or simplified in vitro studies neglect complex in vivo biological environments, the significant benefits and relevance of these discoveries and proposed theories are evident. This approach offers the advantage of preventing errors early in research.",
        "Understanding CGI-HA interactions is crucial for comprehending biomineralisation and the formation of bone and tooth tissues [174]. The behaviour of Ca2+ and Pi ions is influenced not only by the pH and concentration in the environment but also by the type of protein involved, especially its conformation, which dictates the distribution of positive and negative charges on its surface [175].",
        "Wang et al. utilised MD simulation to investigate the initial stage of biomineralisation, characterised by the aggregation and nucleation of Ca2+ and Pi to form CaPi. The results demonstrated that Pi ions play a more critical role in biomineralisation than Ca ions. Moreover, the helical conformation of proteins enhances the likelihood of precipitation of the crystalline phase of HA. It is suggested that the intermittent distribution of acidic and basic residues on protein surfaces promotes the formation of large concentrations of Ca2+ and Pi, potentially leading to homogeneous nucleation [175]. The cumulative charge on the protein surface largely dictates the binding affinity of Ca and Pi ions [176].",
        "Xue et al. proposed a mechanism for forming CaPi minerals on the surface of CGI, which varies depending on the composition of phosphate and carbonate ions. The presence of HPO42− in the solution is critical for regulating apatite nucleation, while the presence of H2PO4− inhibits the crystal nucleation process. The inclusion of CO32− in the solution can promote the formation of CaPi clusters. The regulation of apatite clusters can be achieved by altering the ratio of anion concentrations, such as PO43−/HPO42− and PO43−/CO32−. It is hypothesised that mineralisation and demineralisation are strongly tied to the thermal stability of bonds and the kinetics of ion association [177].",
        "As a substitute for CGI, Zhou et al. designed and synthesised a bioactive peptide as a promising agent for preventing tooth decay. It can inhibit demineralisation in an acidic environment and induce self-healing remineralisation in situ [178]. In the outermost layer of the bioactive peptide, positively charged amino acid residues bind to Pi, while negative charges attract Ca2+. Through this strong interaction, HA nucleation sites are formed [179]. Compared to CGI, this protein shows a statistically higher affinity to the tooth surface, stronger counteracting demineralisation, and the promotion of remineralisation of the tooth [180]. The bioactive peptide also has an antibacterial effect. It inhibits the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans (cariogenic bacteria) [179].",
        "An integrated experimental and computational approach can provide high-resolution insight into the biomineralisation mechanism. MD simulations combined with empirical studies (e.g., NMR spectroscopy) allow for determining how the peptide interacts with the HA surface [181].",
        "Another way to improve the regulation of HA nucleation processes is through enriched proteins in glutamate and aspartate residues and citrate ions. However, this mechanism still needs to be sufficiently elucidated. Zeng et al. used MD simulations to investigate how citrate ions regulate the adsorption behaviour of polyaspartic acid on the surface of HA in a CaPi solution. Polyaspartic acid can be used as an ion chelate for Ca2+ complexation, and it can serve as a template for HA biomineralisation by organizing the distribution of Ca2+ on its surface. In mineralisation, citrate ions act as a bridge between the acidic peptide moiety and the HA surface. Thus, the synergistic role of citrate ion and acidic peptide may provide new insight into interfacial phenomena during biomineralisation [182]. In addition to the peptide structure, apatite doping also affects the adhesion of HA to the protein surface. The peptide binds through electrostatic interactions between the cationic peptide molecules and negatively charged groups on the crystal surface [174]. For example, HA modified by Sr2+ doping was better at promoting protein adhesion than pure HA [183].",
        "CS is used in BTE because its chemical structure mimics the biological behaviour of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [184,185,186]. CS is a natural linear polymer composed of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine units linked by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds with free amino groups. It is the second most naturally occurring polysaccharide. CS is derived from chitin (CN) (see Figure 10), which is isolated from the exoskeletons of shrimps [187], crustaceans, insects, algae, and fungi. To extract CN from, for instance, a crustacean shell, the shell must undergo four steps: pretreatment (washing and drying), demineralisation (acid treatment), deproteinisation (base treatment), and discolouration. CN is then converted to CS through deacetylation (alkaline treatment), which involves the hydrolysis of the acetamide groups and transarrangement of the C-2/C-3 substituent systems in the sugar ring [187,188] (see Figure 10). In general, CS is insoluble in neutral or alkaline solutions due to its specific molecular structure. However, it can dissolve in acidic aqueous solutions (pH < 6.5) by protonating the -NH2 moieties [189]. Both CN and CS can form hydrogels due to the large number of functional groups (hydroxyl and amino) available for chemical reactions [190,191]. However, CS has a stronger reactivity and higher hydrophilicity than CN because of the more significant number of amino groups from the deacetylation process [192].",
        "Due to its biological properties (biocompatibility, biodegradability, bioactivity) [193] and polyelectrolyte activity, CS is a suitable organic material for the development of organic–inorganic composite materials, functioning as a carrier or stabiliser of hydroxyapatite (HA) [194,195,196]. Like GAGs, it supports cell adhesion and growth [197,198]. CS also garners attention for its antibacterial properties [199]. Its degradation products are nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, and noncarcinogenic, attributes gaining importance in tissue engineering, wound healing, and drug delivery [200,201,202,203].",
        "The properties of CS are primarily influenced by the degree of deacetylation (DD) and molecular weight (MW). Various DDs and MWs of pure CS can be obtained by secondary treatment of CN [204]. Studies have demonstrated that DD affects the hydrophilicity and biocompatibility of CS, while MW largely determines the degradation rate and mechanical properties. Higher DD correlates with more efficient cell attachment, proliferation, and bioactivity of growth factors. When comparing two types of CS with identical DD but different MW, the one with a higher MW exhibits superior mechanical properties and a slower degradation rate. On the other hand, if two types of CS have the same MW but different DD, the CS with a higher DD degrades more quickly, contrary to the behaviour observed in low-molecular-weight CS [205,206]. Theoretically, CS with higher DD and MW is more suitable for biomedical applications.",
        "CS, acting as a nucleation substrate, impacts the growth mechanism of HA crystals, which can occur in various ways. Depending on the type and content of ECM components, HA can assume different morphologies, such as spheres, rods, whiskers, needles, and plates [207]. MD simulations reveal possible chemical bond formations between the N atoms of CS and the Ca atoms of HA. Furthermore, they indicate the presence of hydrogen bonds between phosphate’s oxygen atoms and CS’s hydroxyl groups. This insight supports understanding the interfacial interaction mechanism, which depends not only on the primary structure of CS but also on the crystal lattice of HA particles. MD simulations predict the behaviour of CS macromolecules on different HA crystallographic planes, indicating that CS macromolecules adsorb more strongly to the HA (1 0 0) surface than to the HA (0 0 1) and HA (1 1 0) surfaces. The interactions between CS and HA were analysed using concentration profiles and pair correlation functions of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in CS [208].",
        "MD simulations are also utilised to understand the mechanism that enhances the mechanical properties of biomaterials intended for hard tissues. Mathesan et al. observed that both Young’s modulus and maximum stress increase with the rising content of HA and the degree of CS cross-linking. Changes in the conformation of CS chains and the evolution of intrinsic structural variables are tied to these mechanical properties. Further results suggest that the formation of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions force changes in various systems [209]. MD simulations enable an understanding of the deformation mechanisms of HA crystals under uniaxial stretching and compression at the nanoscale. Depending on tensile and compressive loading direction, these can lead to significant compression/stretch asymmetry and crystal anisotropy [210]. It is particularly notable as native HA tends to be Ca deficient. In areas of Ca deficiency, cracks form and expand along the direction of the vacancy. While Ca vacancies can impair the mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite [211], it remains an open question whether these cracks in nanocrystals represent the initial stage of a self-healing mechanism (micro-remodelling process) or if they signal the onset of hard tissue damage [212].",
        "The functionalisation of CS is commonly employed to increase bioactivity, mainly focusing on the selective modification of free amino groups [213]. The reactive primary amines and the primary or secondary hydroxyl groups in CS lend it significant versatility [214,215]. CS derivatives are functional across numerous fields, such as food, agriculture, environment, textiles, medicine, and pharmacy. They can be fabricated in various forms, including gels, micro- or nanoparticles, coatings, and scaffolds [216].",
        "A well-known example is chitosan sulphate (CSS) (see Figure 10). CSS mimics the main GAG in alveolar bone: chondroitin sulphate (ChS). CSS is a negatively charged polysaccharide that interacts with positively charged proteins, which could promote osteoblast adhesion, proliferation, or differentiation. The application of nanotechnology is also crucial, as creating structures at the nanoscale level makes it easier to emulate the natural microarchitecture of bone [217,218]. While these mimicry methods cannot fully replicate the complexity and precision of biomineralisation, they can support bone regeneration, especially in its initial stages. Therefore, further research is needed to understand these processes better.",
        "Another example is carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) (see Figure 10). A CMC-based scaffold coated with tricalcium phosphate (TCP) can biomineralise by forming HA deposits in an ex vivo tooth model [219]. The high mineralisation potential is attributed to carboxyl groups in the organic polymer, which facilitates the spontaneous growth of apatite crystals [220]. The development of these apatite crystals imparts bioactivity to the scaffold and may directly influence its bonding with surrounding structures [221]. Additionally, CMC has antibacterial properties, particularly against cariogenic bacteria, and exhibits considerable potential for wound healing due to its ability to control the expression of the transforming growth factor TGF-β1, interleukin (IL-1), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) [222,223,224].",
        "Three-dimensional printing technology has revolutionised BTE by enabling the production of complex architecture PCL-based scaffolds. Moreover, the precision offered by computer-regulated manufacturing in 3D printing allows for optimising control of critical structural properties such as porosity, pore size, and interconnections in bone scaffolds [49,225]. Table 1 lists the key fabrication parameters for PCL-based scaffolds. Manufacturing 3D-printed grafts remains in its preliminary stages, and researchers still need to establish uniform dimensions for these scaffolds dedicated to BTE. Despite this, integrating cutting-edge imaging technologies with 3D printing, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), enables the designing process of a scaffold architecture for unique tissue defects [13]. As a result, this enhances the efficacy of treating irregular wounds and tissue anomalies, significantly improving medical treatment techniques. In particular, 3D-printed PCL-based scaffolds may significantly contribute to specialised fields such as oral and maxillofacial surgery [11,226] due to their ability to custom-fit unique tissue defects, making them an invaluable tool. Despite the initial high costs associated with research on scaffolds in bone engineering, 3D printing has emerged as a feasible alternative to conventional graft practices [10,227]. Although the high costs associated with the initial stage of research on PCL-based scaffolds in bone engineering are emphasised [119], in the long term, they can reduce the money, time, and effort associated with implantation operations [49]. Consequently, the availability and accessibility of grafts are substantially improved, offering promising prospects for the future of bone engineering.",
        "The method of 3D printing for creating bone engineering scaffolds did not develop earlier because solvent casting was the primary fabrication technique. This delay can be attributed to the lack of suitable materials and control methods for extrusion [16,252]. Only recently has research focused on producing dispersions of nanomaterials in polymer matrices, particularly in PCL, which has led to the development of 3D-printed scaffolds in tissue engineering. These processes help meet the requirement for adequate physical connectivity, which is crucial for effective cell anchoring and adhesion [246].",
        "The extrusion process for PCL filaments necessitates careful consideration of additive content, rheological properties, and processing conditions tailored specifically for the fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing method. Extruded PCL-based filaments, often combined with HA or CS, attract substantial interest due to their osteoinductive potential. Unique behaviour is observed when materials like PCL/HA are used during 3D printing. They form distinctive structures with a higher viscosity than the PCL control sample, requiring increased oversight due to an elevated risk of printer nozzle clogging. Maintaining comprehensive control over the filament deposition temperature and the distance between the filaments is critical to ensuring a successful 3D printing process [16].",
        "Challenges arise when an increase in the HA concentration in the PCL-based filament leads to a corresponding increase in viscosity. This issue can be mitigated by elevating the heating temperature [121,253]. As for material composition, Biscaia et al. argued that incorporating HA into the PCL matrix enhances its mechanical properties, but these enhancements do not proportionally increase with the ceramics’ presence in the composite. The most common weight ratio of polymer to ceramic is 80/20 or 60/40 wt.% [246,254]. In contrast, Rezania et al. suggested that the optimal concentration of HA in the PCL matrix is approximately 30 wt.% [22].",
        "Excessively high HA content and greater fragmentation can increase the risk of ceramic particle agglomeration in the polymer matrix, resulting in a brittle material. However, a proper arrangement of bioceramic reinforcement in the polymer matrix can prevent stress concentration [22,255] and promote the structural integrity of the final material [16,256].",
        "In the context of processing, PCL is one of the most preferred polymers for extrusion-based 3D printing dedicated to medical applications due to its low melting point of about 60 °C (melting temperature, Tm) [33,144,257]. Furthermore, the thermal degradation process of PCL does not begin until approximately 300 °C (degradation temperature, Td) [34]. This fact indicates high static and dynamic thermal resistance due to the range between Tm and Td, known as the wide processing window.",
        "From a rheological perspective, molten PCL displays a broad range of viscoelastic behaviours. At lower temperatures within the processing window, it exhibits viscoelastic properties, whereas at higher temperatures, it assumes the characteristics of a viscous liquid. Consequently, the viscosity within this wide processing window can vary during printing. Therefore, adjusting printing parameters (temperature, melt index, printing speed) ensures consistently structured outcomes with similar pore sizes, shapes, and interconnections [121].",
        "Interestingly, Ogata et al. demonstrated that polyesters (e.g., PLA) that have been melted once do not significantly change their viscosity upon reheating at a higher temperature [258]. However, concurrently, Yoshida et al. observed that the polymer’s heating duration affects its extrusion’s smoothness. This effect is likely due to small bubbles in the molten mix escaping during prolonged heating, which results in a more even distribution of extrusion pressure [121].",
        "Moreover, the optimal velocity and temperature printing adjustment relies not only on the polymer features (such as the MW and polydispersity of PCL) but also on the individual 3D printer heating system and variable ambient temperature. Although DSC studies demonstrate the low melting point of PCL (even approx. 51 °C) [259], the optimal temperature for 3D printing PCL from the extruded filament is around 85–90 °C [121]. Therefore, the wide PCL processing window confirms its potential for creating detailed and complex scaffold structures.",
        "Interestingly, Ghorbani et al. [260] observed that the incorporation of HA induces a higher melting temperature and degree of crystallinity in PCL. Conversely, Biscaia et al. noted that incorporating HA into PCL reduces its endothermic melting enthalpy. This effect is likely attributable to the high crystallinity of HA, which is thought to accelerate the nucleation of PCL chain segments, thereby generating a lower degree of PCL crystallinity [246]. Moreover, 3D printing technology promotes oriented crystallisation [261]. The formation of row nuclei facilitates this process, further enhanced by the flow stress applied to the polymer melt during printing [12,261]. Notably, the crystallinity of the polymer significantly influences the mechanical properties of the produced scaffolds [246,248,261].",
        "Lastly, 3D printing technology offers a distinct advantage over conventional manufacturing methods, such as salt leaching [262] and electrospinning [263,264]. As it does not require toxic solvents, 3D printing provides a safer and more environmentally friendly solution.",
        "Despite its numerous advantages, a 3D-printed PCL-based scaffold has limitations, particularly in the postprocessing stage. The most significant of these are the following: (i) the sterilisation process required before implantation, and (ii) the brittleness of the final scaffold. First, sterilizing PCL-based scaffolds without disturbing their structure can be challenging. This issue partially depends on other characteristics such as mechanical, degradation, surface, and biological properties. Second, some researchers have adopted innovative postprinting modifications like enveloping the 3D-printed PCL scaffold with a layer of CS hydrogel [265] or using a PCL/CS composite [266] hydrogel to develop electrospun sheets, offering a potential solution to the brittleness problem [67]. It is worth noting that CS maintains its thermal stability at PCL printing temperatures. The first melt isothermal process, which occurs above 100 °C, relates more to the loss of bound water than to polysaccharide breakdown [264], thereby preserving its structural integrity during printing. Therefore, to tackle the above problems, 3D printing is combined with other methods, facilitating the development of scaffolds that encapsulate the benefits of both techniques.",
        "3D printing can be combined with electrospinning to produce a scaffold that provides high control over micro- and macrostructure, shape, and mechanical strength. Electrospinning enables the production of fibres with dimensions ranging from microns to the submicron scale. Gonzalez-Pujana et al. demonstrated high metabolic activity and mineralisation of cells cultured on microfibres made from a PCL-based scaffold. Due to electrospun fibres, a microscale structure mimics the cells’ natural environment, promoting osteogenic differentiation [247].",
        "Another hybrid technology involves the combination of 3D printing and freeze-drying. This technology can produce spongy structures with controlled pore size gradients, resulting in scaffolds that exhibit interconnected and adjustable pore structures [267]. When a scaffold is soaked in a solution containing growth factors or other bioactive substances and then subjected to freeze-drying, these bioactive factors become fixed within the scaffold structure [268]. For instance, PCL has been functionalised with a decellularised bone extracellular matrix (dbECM) to produce osteoinductive fibres for 3D printing. Adding bone dbECM to PCL enhanced the mechanical properties of the resulting scaffold, improved cell adhesion, and promoted osteogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [21,269].",
        "One of the key aspects of scaffolds is their external morphology structure, which affects their performance and tissue interaction. The parameters closely related to the functionality of the scaffold are the size and geometry of pores and their interconnections.",
        "Well-designed porosity with interconnected pores stimulates new bone tissue growth [270]. Additionally, vascular infiltration can be modulated by controlling pore size. Macropores provide space that facilitates cell migration and tissue penetration, thus promoting bone tissue regeneration. Numerous studies have examined the effect of varying pore sizes on the adhesion, proliferation, and migration of different cell types, such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and fibroblasts [271]. Oh et al. reported that the appropriate pore size for osteoblast and chondrocyte growth ranges from 300 to 400 μm, while fibroblasts should be around 200 μm [272]. Therefore, the suitable pore size in PCL scaffolds can be estimated to lie between 200 and 400 μm [238]. However, two optimal pore size ranges were also distinguished: 200–600 μm [16,273,274] and 450–700 μm [275]. For instance, Wang et al. used a pore size of 550 μm, which falls within these ranges [16]. Furthermore, pore sizes above 300 μm have been reported to improve vascularity and bone ingrowth [131,246,276,277,278].",
        "Interestingly, Ghayor et al. challenged the long-standing assumption that the optimal pore size for bone scaffolds ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 mm. They contend that the ideal pore size should fall between 0.7 and 1.2 mm. These assertions stem from their work with TPC-based scaffolds produced through 3D printing, which they assessed for potential in facilitating in vivo bone formation. They suggest that these findings may pave the way for innovative methodologies in treating bone defects [36,108].",
        "Building on Ghayor’s paradigm regarding larger pore sizes, the research of Hernandez et al. warrants consideration. They devised a hybrid system using a PCL-based scaffold featuring a pore size of 1.2 mm complemented by a hydrogel. This design exhibited cytocompatibility, as evidenced by the successful adhesion and viability of hMSC within the hydrogel matrix and on the solid scaffold surfaces. Furthermore, biomineralisation tests in SBF highlighted the nucleation and growth of apatite crystals both within the hydrogel and on the PCL scaffold, attesting to its bioactivity. While this hybrid system is optimised for addressing long bone defects, comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies remain indispensable [230].",
        "Although pore size and geometry are known to influence cell behaviour and tissue formation in vitro, it is unclear how this translates to in vivo scenarios [279]. However, pore architecture inside a scaffold is inevitably necessary for effectively binding growth factors and nutrient transport to cells.",
        "In addition to macropores, scaffolds also contain micropores, which can have positive and negative effects. On the one hand, they can accelerate surface roughness, degradation, and resorption of PCL, which is inherently slow. On the other hand, these micropores could reduce the structure’s compressive strength [246]. Therefore, a balance must be found to maintain the scaffold’s structural integrity.",
        "Equally important is the scaffold’s mechanical behaviour, which heavily depends on a precisely defined pore geometry and directly affects cell interaction. Scaffold structures can be fabricated in various forms, such as helixes, meshes, rings [265], or orthogonal, circular, and sinusoidal shapes [280]. Thus, innovative, versatile, and efficient strategies to 3D print PCL scaffolds with unique anisotropic and curved geometries could better mimic natural tissue.",
        "In conclusion, while size and geometry influence cell behaviour and tissue formation in vitro, our understanding of how this translates to the in vivo scenario remains limited [108,279]. However, one thing is certain: pore architecture is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the effective binding of growth factors and transport of nutrients to cells. By appropriately designing porosity, pore size, and geometry, we can achieve scaffolds with optimal mechanical properties, enhancing osteoconductive features.",
        "In BTE, predicting the forces exerted on native bone during normal function is particularly relevant for designing, fabricating, and integrating a printed scaffold with the host. The most important mechanical property parameters for alveolar bone are the compressive strength and modulus of elasticity, as, during the opening and closing of the jaw, the most significant force induced at the dental symphysis is the compressive force in the transverse direction [281]. The mechanical properties of the 3D-printed PCL scaffold’s layer-by-layer construction can be estimated based on the compact and cancellous bone structure’s volume ratio.",
        "Generally, the compact structure of bone, depending on the orientation of HA crystal growth (transverse or longitudinal), mechanically resembles either a semibrittle or viscoelastic material [282]. The transverse compressive strength of the compact bone structure ranges from 131 to 224 MPa. The modulus of elasticity for compact bone is 17.0 to 20.0 GPa in the longitudinal direction, with a shear modulus of 3.30 GPa and a structural density of 1.80 g/cm3 [283].",
        "As for the cancellous bone structure, it is highly porous, and its density is 0.20 g/cm3. The compressive strength of the spongy bone structure depends on its apparent density and ranges from 2.0 to 5.0 MPa. The modulus of elasticity ranges from 90.0 to 400.0 MPa [284].",
        "The volume ratio of these structures, constituting the alveolar bone, is determined by various factors such as the location of bone loss in the alveolar bone, age, sex, and health status. The optimal compressive strength might range between 5.0 and 131.0 MPa, while the elastic modulus could lie between 400.0 MPa and 17.0 GPa. Lv et al. contend that scaffolds, which mimic the structure of natural cancellous bone, adapt more adeptly to the microenvironment [285]. Conversely, Pitrolino et al. questioned the validity of designing scaffolds to align with the mechanical properties of native bone tissue. They argued that designing an optimal cellular niche should take precedence over delineating the mechanical strength specifications of scaffolds, as osteocytes—when formed in the appropriate cellular niche—assume the role of structural and mechanical integration within the tissue [286].",
        "Although modelling the alveolar bone’s mechanical properties requires more detailed research and analysis, compact and cancellous bone structures’ compressive strength and elastic modulus provide valuable data. Implanting a scaffold with either excessive or insufficient mechanical strength at the implant site could fail to support native bone growth or lead to bone resorption. Thus, the scaffold’s ability to provide the required mechanical support is a critical criterion for the resulting structure. For instance, Wang et al. obtained PCL-based scaffolds with HA (20 wt.%), achieving compressive strength and elastic modulus of 8.0–11.7 MPa and 11.4–29.2 GPa, respectively. According to the proposal above, these values meet the proposal requirements of the mechanical property of trabecular bones [16].",
        "Apart from orientation, location, and host age, the water environment plays a crucial role in the mechanical assessment of the scaffold. The behaviour of bone in a wet state significantly diverges from that in its dry form [79,287]. To facilitate proper regeneration without notable deformations, the PCL-based scaffold—modified by introducing HA and CS—should offer an elastic modulus identical to that of hard tissues: 1500 MPa in dry and approximately 10 MPa in wet conditions. Pressure causes the liquid to be extruded from the porous structure, thereby increasing the colloidal osmotic pressure and, consequently, the Young’s modulus. An elevated Young’s modulus enhances resilience to high stress [288,289], and the higher the elastic modulus, the less likely the scaffold will deform.",
        "The alveolar bone develops healthily when optimal mechanical forces act on it. Osteocytes embedded in the bone matrix are the primary mechanically sensitive cells involved in the transduction of mechanical stress into a biological response [6]. It is assumed that resorption of the alveolar bone occurs especially when a tooth is missing, i.e., when the alveolar bone is unaffected by mechanical forces. Regarding the designed scaffolds, structural parameters (porosity, pore connections, pore size, and pore geometry) and mechanical parameters (compressive strength and modulus of elasticity) affect how osteocytes perceive mechanical stimuli, which may affect their biochemical reactions. In this respect, the intramembranous ossification of the alveolar bone can be analogously compared to the piezoelectric effect. Since the mechanical stresses in the piezoelectric material generate an electric field (electrical signal), the mechanical stresses in the alveolar bone initiate a biochemical signal towards enzymatic activation for biomineralisation, which ultimately ends in ossification. This unique ability to convert mechanical forces into a biochemical signal is called mechanotransduction. Probably, ionic proteins are responsible for mechanotransduction [290]. These proteins immediately respond to mechanical stimuli by initiating an ionic current. As evidence grows regarding the critical role of this phenomenon in the management of physiological processes, there is a need to identify these proteins [291]. Design scaffolds taking this phenomenon into account become increasingly urgent.",
        "Understanding the relationship between the structural and mechanical parameters of the scaffold and its mechanotransduction capacity is crucial in bone tissue regeneration [122]. The question arises: how does mechanotransduction affect the ossification process? Al-Maslamani et al. developed cell-stretching devices to explore the molecular pathways responsible for cellular responses to mechanobiological processes [292]. Therefore, in the context of BTE, essential factors influencing regenerated bone dynamics are not only biological but also mechanical issues. Figure 11 shows theoretical diagrams of the relationship between mechanical stress (MS), biochemical signals (BS), and the ossification process (OP). Ossification of the healing alveolar bone uses physical movement, mainly compressive forces (less stretching), imitating orthodontic tooth movement.",
        "In a biomechanical context, tensile stress breaks down adjacent ECM molecules, thereby evenly distributing protein molecules. Compressive stress causes the accumulation of adjacent molecules, shortening the distance between HA crystals and affecting bone tissue growth. Both of these stresses regulate bone tissue homeostasis at the local site. Undoubtedly, bone tissue expands as a result of its regular mechanical stimulation. Due to the nature of the load, this stimulation can be divided into two types, static load (Wolf’s law) and dynamic load (Delpech’s law), which affect the formation of bone trabeculae. Too little or too much static load on the bones causes osteoporosis, while too little or too much dynamic load causes atherosclerosis. Disproportionate stress and friction promote inflammation, activating the action of osteoclasts and cytokinins [289]. The hypothesis remains unsettled as to whether the action of compressive and tensile forces in the early period of alveolar process healing is necessary.",
        "A particular challenge in designing a PCL-based scaffold is considering its degradation properties. From a materials engineering perspective, degradation deteriorates the structural integrity of the structure and leads to a decline in the mechanical properties of the scaffold. It indicates that a scaffold must be designed so that native bone tissue forms in place of the degraded polymer, subsequently assuming the structural and strength functions. The primary task within this paradigm is to synchronise scaffold degradation kinetics with tissue regeneration rates while maintaining identical structural and mechanical integrity [293]. In the context of bone engineering, PCL has a long degradation time of two to four years [264,294], while bone remodelling takes about six months [295]. Factors that may affect the rate of degradation and the structural and mechanical integration of the scaffold include the following:Material characteristics (degree of crystallinity, polydispersity and MW of PCL, amount and type of components with osteoinductive potential in the PCL matrix).Topological features (porosity, size and shape of pores, thickness of solid material).Degradation environment (pH, ion exchange) [34,296].",
        "Material characteristics (degree of crystallinity, polydispersity and MW of PCL, amount and type of components with osteoinductive potential in the PCL matrix).",
        "Topological features (porosity, size and shape of pores, thickness of solid material).",
        "Degradation environment (pH, ion exchange) [34,296].",
        "Understanding the degradation mechanism of PCL is essential for its application in the biomedical and pharmaceutical domains [297]. PCL belongs to semicrystalline polymers. Chemical degradation primarily occurs in the amorphous regions of PCL where hydrolysis of ester bonds takes place, breaking longer PCL chains into oligomeric (shorter) ones [296,298,299]. Yoshida et al. reported that the hydrolysis of PCL ester groups exhibits first-order kinetics, meaning that the degradation rate depends mainly on the amount and MW of the polymer [121]. However, an autocatalytic effect emerges in the amorphous regions as the degradation progresses. The cleavage of labile ester moieties, and thus the formation of oligomers with carboxylic and hydroxyl end groups, can uncontrollably accelerate the hydrolysis of adjacent ester moieties [300,301]. PCL degradation products diffuse less easily than other polyesters with shorter aliphatic chains. In addition, the oligomers formed are acidic. Yoshida et al. recorded a pH value that dropped from pH 7.45 to pH 6.11 within 28 days of degradation, a finding also consistent with the downward trend reported by Sung et al. [32]. Lowering the pH confirms that acidic metabolites are formed due to PCL degradation [264]. Although a decrease in pH occurs, PCL degradation products induce fewer pH changes in the local medium than other aliphatic polyesters [296]. Incorporating ceramic particles into a PCL matrix exhibits buffering behaviour [117]. However, a comparison of the degradation kinetics of PCL-based scaffolds containing different ceramic materials still needs to be included [34].",
        "Although the amorphous regions of semicrystalline polymers are more susceptible to hydrolytic degradation [296,299], degradation also occurs in the less accessible crystalline regions, which, in the case of PCL, are represented by numerous spherulites. As the degradation of the intact chains in the crystalline regions progresses, the form of the spherulites changes into so-called “crystalline residues” that take on the structure of “elongated-chain crystallites” [297].",
        "Along with hydrolytic degradation, the phenomenon of recrystallisation occurs. It involves the amorphous areas of PCL rearranging to more ordered structures in contact with the crystalline areas (interspherulitic boundaries). Li et al. reported that adding PCL (approx. 25 wt.%) to other aliphatic polyesters such as PLA (approx. 75 wt.%) leads to an increase in the degree of crystallinity of the composite—from the initial 14 wt.% by mass up to 52 wt.%—after 63 weeks of research on the degradation process. This reorganisation is attributed to the low glass transition temperature of the polymer [302]. The preservation of amorphous regions and the dominance of imperfect and defective crystalline regions helps counteract the phenomenon of recrystallisation, thereby increasing the degradation rate. It can be found that the addition of CS reduces the spherulites and forms more distinct interspherulitic PCL boundaries [260]. The effect of counteracting the phenomenon of recrystallisation is attributed to the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds between polysaccharide rings in CS chains [265,303], which aids in the hydrolytic degradation of PCL ester groups.",
        "In vivo, enzymatic degradation also occurs, which attacks the crystalline regions of PCL, disintegrating the scaffold structure. In vitro studies in which a PCL-based scaffold was subjected to enzymatic degradation began to be reported in the literature [304,305]. However, Bartnikowski et al. exposed PCL-based 3D scaffolds to concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl). Acid etching of these scaffolds with different concentrations of HCl, due to the intense penetration of protons (H+), ultimately led to the disintegration of the scaffold structure. The features of acid hydrolysis represent degradation under physiological conditions. Acid digestion can be compared to the action of enzymes in the oral cavity at the site of the defect, which, due to inflammation, is locally acidic. By imitating the microenvironment of the cavity, one can estimate material characteristics and scaffold topology, both of which are dependent not only on the structure and components but also on the technique used to manufacture the material [296].",
        "The type of erosion determines the structural and mechanical integrity of PCL-based scaffolds. Subject to hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation, scaffolds may undergo either surface or bulk erosion or a combination of both.",
        "Surface erosion is common with polyesters, which, despite being hydrophobic, are highly susceptible to surface hydrolysis. The advantage of surface erosion is that while the structure’s size decreases with weight loss, its density remains unchanged. This characteristic allows the scaffold to maintain its mechanical integrity, a property critical to BTE. Generally, the surface will degrade initially when the scaffold structure comes into contact with a degrading medium. As the medium penetrates the material, most of the scaffold’s solid material begins to break down. This process results in bulk erosion, during which the construct’s volume stays the same, but there is a decrease in density and mechanical strength [306].",
        "Although surface erosion is generally slower than mass erosion, it is typically more desirable because the material decomposes uniformly at a constant rate, making it easier to control. Furthermore, uncontrolled autocatalytic degradation often occurs in conjunction with progressing bulk erosion. It is frequently observed with polyesters, as their acidic degradation products cannot easily diffuse through the polymer network. This results in a localised increase in acidity, which in turn accelerates the scaffold’s degradation in an uncontrolled manner [29,307].",
        "The task involves designing a scaffold with a specific surface erosion timeline and estimating the final stage of degradation when simultaneous surface and volume erosion occurs to predict the time of structural and mechanical disintegration. Maintaining structural and mechanical integrity depends not only on the underlying mechanism of PCL degradation but also on the scaffold’s topology and the surrounding microenvironment [296].",
        "The type of erosion also depends on the fibre thickness and the nature of the solid scaffold material. For instance, once the critical thickness of aliphatic polyester fibre exceeds 2 mm, the degradation mechanism changes from surface erosion to bulk erosion, regardless of ion exchange [306]. In the core part of the materials, partially degraded oligomeric chains accumulate and initiate hydrolysis with a high catalytic effect, potentially leading to accelerated and uncontrolled hydrolytic degradation in the core part—a phenomenon referred to as core-accelerated bulk erosion. However, concerning poly(L-lactide) PLLA, a polyester belonging to the same polymer family as PCL, Tsuji et al. observed that when the diameter of the scaffold fibres is less than 2 mm and optimal ion exchange is ensured, PLLA tends to undergo surface erosion [297]. In this case, ions do not diffuse into the material, meaning that a substantial part remains unaffected. Interestingly, Grizzi et al. noted that foils, powders, and microspheres of PLLA degrade much more slowly than solid material samples [308]. The smaller the polymer size (corresponding to an increased specific surface area), the slower the degradation rate.",
        "Although enhancing the surface area of aliphatic polyester-based scaffold fibres slows down degradation, the degradation process becomes more uniform and easily controlled due to the reduction in internal heterogeneous autocatalytic degradation. An illustrative example is a study on the degradation rate of films of another aliphatic polyester (e.g., PLLA) about porosity. It was found that nonporous PLLA degrades faster than porous PLLA [309,310]. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that ion exchange is facilitated in a porous structure, thus inhibiting autocatalytic bulk erosion and maintaining the structure’s integrity for extended periods.",
        "The type of erosion also depends on factors related to the degradation medium, such as pH, temperature, and the presence of ions and enzymes. Therefore, the site of implant placement is vital. In areas with poor vascularisation and low diffusion, degradation products tend to linger, resulting in increased acidity. Bulk erosion is in environments where the ion exchange of Ca2+ and Pi is restricted [297]. Consequently, the type of erosion is strongly determined by the ion exchange characteristics of the microenvironment. When optimal ion exchange occurs, the types of erosion generally occur sequentially: surface erosion precedes bulk erosion.",
        "In conclusion, the degradation of aliphatic polyesters, e.g., PCL, involves a complex interplay of several parallel and successive phenomena, including water absorption, cleavage of ester bonds, neutralisation of terminal carboxyl groups on the surface, internal autocatalysis, diffusion and solubilisation of oligomers, and recrystallisation effects [311,312]. The type of erosion that PCL naturally undergoes in a physiological environment is currently debated. Although pure PCL scaffolds do not experience significant erosion initially (nominally less than 1 wt.% loss, up to 1 to 3 months) [313,314], the situation alters slightly for a PCL scaffold with incorporated ceramic particles or CS. These scaffolds exhibit weight loss within the first seven days. However, the origin of this material loss is challenging to ascertain. It could be attributed less to PCL degradation and more to the strong binding of water to HA and CS, as these compounds make it difficult to remove moisture [121].",
        "A scaffold in bone engineering should be biocompatible and biodegradable, and also, its surface should be conducive to migration and anchoring osteoblasts as a direct site of interaction with host cells. The scaffold’s physical properties (e.g., surface roughness, development of the specific surface area) [315] play a critical role in providing cell anchorage [16]. Successful anchoring enables effective cell adhesion [316]. Cell adhesion allows cells to stick to the scaffold’s surface through specific molecular interactions, promotes cell proliferation, and enables cell differentiation through the development of a specific surface area [251,317].",
        "Natural polymers such as proteins (e.g., CGI) and polysaccharides (e.g., CS) are considered suitable materials for facilitating osteoblast anchoring due to the presence of functional groups that differ in polarity, electrostatic charge, and ability to interact via van der Waals forces [318]. Unfortunately, their relatively poor mechanical properties, such as high brittleness and insufficient compressive strength, do not meet the necessary structural and mechanical requirements. Thus, while natural polymers possess high osteoinductive potential, they lack osteoconductive features. This leads to the consideration of synthetic biopolymers like PCL in BTE. PCL has appropriate mechanical properties but is marked by significant hydrophobicity [319]. Modifying a PCL-based scaffold is required to improve its surface wettability [103,320].",
        "One method of enhancing the hydrophilicity of a PCL-based scaffold surface is through the incorporation of HA. The presence of ceramic particles increases the material’s hydrophilicity due to the micropores that appear on the surface of the scaffold fibres, which are associated with greater polarity. While the reasons for the altered surface architecture are unclear, as noted by various authors, a strong correlation has been identified between increased roughness and improved cell adhesion [152,246]. The uniform distribution of HA in the PCL matrix, with some particles exposed on the surface of the filament and some forming agglomerations, amplifies its cellular activity [16,321]. For instance, a higher value of surface roughness of the scaffold fibres was also observed when the concentration of CS was increased [121].",
        "Two specific methods for surface functionalisation, aimed at eliciting desired biological responses, are also noted: gas plasma treatment and the exposure of the polymer surface to other reactive reagents, such as through acid and alkali etching [319].",
        "These methods enhance surface roughness and introduce new functional groups through the covalent modification of the polymer surface due to surface degradation. These surfaces can then be further modified by attaching biologically active compounds such as CGI and growth factors (e.g., BMP-2). This wetting effect can enhance the degree of biomineralisation [322,323,324,325]. The surface properties of PCL can be altered by combining plasma treatment and collagen modification. Studies were also conducted to immobilise collagen on the surface of ultrathin PCL films, significantly improving hydrophilicity after surface modification [326]. The rate of cell attachment and proliferation on the resulting films was increased. Integrins, cytoskeletal and ECM proteins such as CGI and the arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide, can be covalently attached or physically deposited (via electrostatic adsorption) on the PCL surface.",
        "Another method to increase the hydrophilicity of a PCL-based scaffold involves etching with concentrated acids or bases. For instance, a PCL-based scaffold can be immersed in a NaOH solution for 24 h, increasing hydrophilicity promoted by alkaline hydrolysis [238]. This process contributes to the formation of additional carboxylate (COO−) and hydroxyl (OH−) groups at the ends of the PCL chain on the surface of the scaffold, thereby increasing its roughness through surface erosion. The interaction of the PCL-based scaffold with a drop of water has been found to correlate with scaffold–protein and scaffold–cell interactions [327,328]. Therefore, the contact angle can be interpreted as an indicator of the scaffold’s initial cell adhesion capacity. For instance, PCL scaffolds with higher HA concentrations (20 wt.%) exhibit a smaller contact angle (approx. 78°), reflecting superior hydrophilicity [236].",
        "Designing scaffolds for alveolar bone augmentation poses a significant challenge. Any discussion to determine scaffold characteristics should begin with a systematic meta-analysis of biomineralisation and ossification. Currently, the literature primarily consists of phenomenological descriptions of these processes. Although our understanding of bone tissue growth at the micro- and macroscopic levels is limited, an examination of the mechanisms of biomineralisation and ossification through the lens of materials engineering and bone tissue can provide direction for the development of osteoconductive scaffolds with osteoinductive potential.",
        "The initial proposal for design involves the selection of materials. A scaffold based on polycaprolactone (PCL), characterised by its optimal biocompatibility, biodegradability, and bioresorbability, emerges as a suitable candidate for scaffolds that exhibit osteoconductive characteristics. Synthetic polyesters can undergo modifications to render their properties suitable for bone tissue engineering (BTE). PCL-based scaffolds, when modified with hydroxyapatite (HA), type I collagen (CGI), and chitosan (CS) particles, demonstrate high osteoinductive potential. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the CGI–HA and CS–HA interactions serve as a guide for in vitro testing.",
        "The strategy for designing PCL-based scaffolds is in its nascent stages. Currently, it involves employing heuristic methods to explore the most effective ways of obtaining and analysing scaffold properties. A research path ranging from fundamental principles to clinical applications must be standardised to implement a scaffold in an alveolar bone defect successfully. The present challenge at the meta-analytical level calls for an interdisciplinary approach (Figure 12). Each step of the design process necessitates verifying and evaluating correlation relationships to ensure the scaffold meets the required standards and proves safe and effective for final clinical applications.",
        "Currently, the prevailing trend in designing precise augmentation of alveolar bone defects involves fabricating scaffolds using 3D printing. The ideal pore size and interconnectivity for cell migration, nutrient transport, and vascularisation have yet to be standardised. Moreover, integrating mechanotransduction and cell signals into 3D-printed scaffolds to guide and stimulate bone growth still needs to be explored. The standardisation of mechanical properties is also a subject of debate. Additionally, while most studies initially focus on mechanical properties, the long-term performance of scaffolds in vitro and in vivo, as degradation progresses, remains to be investigated.",
        "Further research is required to determine how to maintain structural and mechanical integrity. Moreover, surface modifications of the scaffold play a pivotal role. A burgeoning area of research involves introducing HA/CS composites into the PCL matrix or depositing CGI onto the surface of the PCL scaffold.",
        "Despite current research gaps, the potential of 3D-printed PCL-based scaffolds reinforced with HA, CGI, and CS for BTE is significant. The design of the scaffolds’ structural, mechanical, degradation, and surface properties could promote osteoblast adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. These are crucial mechanisms for successful bone regeneration, especially in the case of the alveolar bone, which is sensitive to disturbances in homeostasis. Future research to resolve the discussed limitations will facilitate the development of new concepts and research procedures in BTE.",

        "Segmental tracheal defects, caused by congenital anomalies, trauma, or malignancy resection, present a critical clinical challenge due to the absence of reliable regenerative solutions. The trachea's unique architecture, which build of alternating cartilaginous rings and fibrous connective tissue, gives structural rigidity and flexibility to withstand respiratory forces. However, defects exceeding 50 % of the tracheal length often require surgical intervention, as self-repair is limited by poor vascularization and mechanical instability [1]. Current clinical approaches, including autografts and synthetic prostheses, are limited by immune rejection and mechanical mismatch, leading to complications such as stenosis, graft collapse, or infection [[2], [3], [4]]. The native trachea comprises 16–20 C-shaped hyaline cartilage rings interconnected by fibrous connective tissue and smooth muscle, forming a semi-rigid, flexible tubular structure [1,2]. While the cartilage rings are not fully circumferential, their alternating arrangement with fibrous-muscular tissue enables the trachea to withstand compressive forces during respiration while retaining flexibility for dynamic movements [3,4]. Synthetic materials like silicone or polypropylene cannot mimic the biomechanical strength of natural trachea. This mismatch causes stress shielding and mucosal erosion [5]. Autologous tissues are biocompatible but still have limits like availability and anatomical mismatch [6]. These limitations present the need for tissue-engineered solutions. The solution must replicate the trachea's structural and functional complexity.",
        "Recent advances in 3D bioprinting and biomaterial engineering enable precise printing of multicellular constructs. Complex programming of mechanical properties and biological functions is now achievable, which is vital for replicating the trachea's complicated architecture. Hydrogels such as gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), chondroitin sulfate methacryloyl (ChSMA), and silk fibroin methacryloyl (SilMA) are widely used for their biocompatibility and tunable stiffness [[7], [8], [9]]Decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM)-based bioinks have emerged as promising alternatives, offering tissue-specific biochemical cues to enhance cellular recruitment and functional maturation. For instance, Zhang et al. demonstrated that cartilage-derived dECM bioinks improved chondrocyte proliferation and matrix deposition in bioprinted tracheal constructs [10]. However, conventional dECM bioinks often suffer from batch variability and inadequate mechanical strength for load-bearing application. To address these challenges, hybrid strategies combining dECM with synthetic polymers (e.g., polycaprolactone or nanoclay composites) have gained traction. Shen et al. developed nanoclay-reinforced dECM bioinks that enhanced osteogenic differentiation while maintaining extrusion fidelity, highlighting the potential for hybrid materials in complex tissue engineering [11]. Additionally, emerging technologies like volumetric bioprinting and embedded 3D printing have enabled rapid fabrication of vascularized tissues. Bernal et al. (2021) reported that volumetric bioprinting could create centimeter-scale vascular networks within minutes, addressing a key bottleneck in tracheal graft vascularization [12].",
        "Despite these advancements, few bioinks simultaneously address the trachea's anisotropic mechanics, vascular integration, and long-term stability. GelMA, a photocrosslinkable collagen derivative, promotes cell adhesion but lacks sufficient mechanical strength for load-bearing applications [13]. ChSMA improves chondrogenic differentiation but exhibits fast gelation kinetics that compromise printability [14], while SilMA offers elasticity but lacks bioactive signals for vascularization [15]. Furthermore, dynamic self-healing properties—critical for interfacial cohesion between heterogeneous tissue layers—are rarely integrated into tracheal bioinks. Li et al. (2022) developed self-healing hydrogels with dynamic covalent bonds, demonstrating enhanced mechanical resilience and vascular ingrowth in vivo [16]. However, their application in tracheal bioprinting remains unexplored.",
        "To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a biomimetic chondro-fibrous integrated trachea (CFT) built by 3D bioprinting using tissue-specific hydrogels functionalized with a self-healing glucomannan-peptide copolymer (GM-P). Unlike common materials, GM-P enhances interfacial cohesion, sustains angiogenic signaling, and enables dynamic mechanical adaptation through shear-thinning behavior. By using iPSC-derived chondrocytes and fibroblasts, we engineered alternating cartilaginous and fibrous rings that replicate native tracheal anisotropy. This approach integrates material innovation with stem cell technology to overcome translational barriers in vascularization, mechanical compatibility, and seed cell sourcing, offering a clinically viable strategy for tracheal reconstruction.",

After crosslinking, plain GelMA, GCGM-P and GSGM-P became opaque. This opacity likely came from increased light scattering caused by polymer network densification and microphase separation during photocrosslinking, which disrupted the initial homogeneous molecular arrangement.Fig. 1Characterization and rheological analysis of Multifuctinal Tissue-specific Hydrogels.

        "The molecular architectures of plain 10 % GelMA, GCGM-P (GelMA/ChSMA/GM-P), and GSGM-P (GelMA/SilMA/GM-P) highlight their distinct crosslinking mechanisms. 1H NMR spectroscopy confirmed the dense ChSMA network in GCGM-P, as indicated by new crosslinking-related peaks at 7.25–7.75 ppm (Fig. 1B), which indicated enhanced hydrophobic interactions between ChSMA and GelMA. These interactions sterically hindered polymerization, delaying gelation. In contrast, SilMA in GSGM-P contributed to a flexible yet resilient network through its high-density methacryloyl groups and elongated polymer chains. The intrinsic chain flexibility in SilMA allowed gradual reorganization during crosslinking, balancing rapid network formation with energy dissipation capacity.",
        "Both GCGM-P and GSGM-P demonstrated significantly prolonged gelation times compared to plain GelMA (6.2 ± 0.3 s vs. 9.6 ± 0.4 s and 8.3 ± 0.4 s, Fig. 1C). In the case of GCGM-P, this delay was attributed to the rigid, hydrophobic ChSMA framework, which sterically hindered molecular mobility and consequently reduced crosslinking efficiency. For GSGM-P, the slower gelation time was ascribed to SilMA's dynamic chain reorganization during photocrosslinking, where its elongated polymer topology temporarily constrained rapid network assembly. These delays highlight distinct material design philosophies: ChSMA emphasizes structural stability, whereas SilMA achieves a balance between crosslinking kinetics and inherent energy-dissipative capabilities, both of which surpass the functional simplicity of the conventional GelMA network.Notably, despite the incorporation of additional polymer networks, the compressive modulus of GSGM-P (13.4 ± 1.4 MPa) was lower than that of plain GelMA (15.6 ± 2.0 MPa). This apparent contradiction arises from the distinct material interactions in GSGM-P: (1) SilMA's elastomeric methacrylated silk fibroin chains formed a loosely crosslinked network dominated by flexible β-sheet structures [9], prioritizing energy dissipation over rigidity; (2) Phase separation between SilMA and GelMA (evidenced by SEM in Fig. 1G) created heterogeneous domains with reduced crosslinking density, further lowering stiffness [32]; (3) The dynamic self-healing GM-P copolymer introduced reversible hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, which enhanced shear-thinning behavior (Fig. 1L and M) but compromised static mechanical strength [16]. These results highlight the critical role of polymer chemistry in tailoring hydrogel mechanics for specific tissue layers—stiff cartilaginous regions versus flexible fibrous interfaces.",
        "Mechanical characterization revealed that GCGM-P exhibited a shear modulus of 5.35 ± 0.64 kPa, significantly higher than GSGM-P (3.39 ± 0.25 kPa) and 10 % GelMA (3.61 ± 0.44 kPa) (Fig.D), attributed to the rigid ChSMA framework. In contrast, GSGM-P's modulus was similar to native fibrous tissue due to the elastomeric SilMA network. Swelling tests in PBS (pH 7.4) revealed equilibrium swelling ratios of 100 ± 3.5 % (GCGM-P) and 120 ± 2 % (GSGM-P), while enzymatic degradation in collagenase/hyaluronidase (20 U/mL, 37 °C) reached 85 ± 2.5 % and 90 ± 3 % after 6 h, confirming controlled biodegradability (Fig. 1E and F).",
        "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of freeze-dried hydrogels showed interconnected porous architectures with pore sizes of 272.6 ± 47.38 μm (GCGM-P) and 347.6 ± 56.36 μm (GSGM-P) (Fig. 1G), revealing cell infiltration and nutrient diffusion. Rheological analysis further validated their stability under physiological conditions. Both GCGM-P and GSGM-P exhibited satisfying time-dependent stability, maintaining consistent storage moduli (G) over a 30-min period (Fig. 1H and I). Temperature sweep analyses revealed reversible gel-to-sol transitions at 35 °C (Fig. 1J,K), a critical feature for preserving structural integrity during post-printing cooling. Furthermore, strain amplitude sweeps confirmed shear-thinning behavior (G’< G″ at y> 50 %, Fig. 1L and M), critical for extrusion-based bioprinting. These results proved mechanical, structural and degradative properties of the hydrogels, enabling their application in biomimetic tracheal reconstruction [20,21].",
        "GelMA (fixed at 10 %) was selected based on its balance between biocompatibility and structural stability in extrusion-based bioprinting [12,15]. ChSMA (2 %) in GCGM-P follows optimized ratios from cartilage tissue engineering literature, where ≤2 % maintains printability while achieving compressive moduli comparable to native cartilage [20,21]. SilMA (6 %) in GSGM-P reflects fibrous tissue engineering standards, balancing flexibility and degradation kinetics as validated in vascular and dermal regeneration models [22,23].",
        "The mechanical and degradative properties of GCGM-P and GSGM-P hydrogels showed their potential for biomimetic tracheal reconstruction. The delayed gelation of GCGM-P, attributed to the dense ChSMA network, ensures structural integrity during printing, while the elastomeric SilMA in GSGM-P mimics native fibrous tissue flexibility. These results addressed the importance of crosslinking density in balancing printability and mechanical resilience [16,17]. The controlled biodegradability and interconnected porous architectures further support cell infiltration and nutrient diffusion, breaking through a key limitation in common hydrogels [18].",
        "To closely mimic the alternating stiff-to-soft tissue architecture of the native trachea, we designed two types of matrix hydrogels with different mechanical properties: GCGM-P (10 % GelMA, 2 % ChSMA, 1 % PEO, 1 % GM-P) for cartilage regeneration and GSGM-P (10 % GelMA, 6 % SilMA, 1 % PEO, 1 % GM-P) for fibrous tissue integration. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, both GCGM-P and GSGM-P showed excellent compressive resilience, withstanding up to approximately 85 % strain due to the ductile network of GelMA, which facilitates adaptation to the physiological movements of the native trachea. However, the introduction of a highly crosslinked ChSMA network into the soft GelMA network significantly increased the compressive modulus from 15.6 ± 2.0 MPa to 58.7 ± 4.2 MPa, while a low-crosslinked SilMA network slightly reduced the compressive modulus to 13.4 ± 1.4 MPa (Fig. 2C). The similar trend was observed in repeated compressive cycle tests, where GCGM-P maintained higher mechanical strength than GSGM-P after five compressive cycles (Fig. 2D and E). Both GCGM-P and GSGM-P showed no significant decline in mechanical strength at approximately 60 % strain after five compressive cycles.Fig. 2Analyses of anisotropic structural design.

        "As shown in Fig. 2F, the results of the FEA demonstrated that the interconnected structural design significantly enhanced the integration between the FBs rings and the CHs rings. Under axial compression, the tubular structure withstood the applied forces, with stress distributed evenly across the stiff and soft regions. Similarly, under axial tension, the model exhibited uniform stress distribution, indicating mechanical integration between the alternating rings. In lateral compression, the flexible gaps between the rigid CHs rings allowed for effective dispersion of perpendicular compressive forces, maintaining structural stability.",
        "Finite element analysis (FEA) further revealed that the alternating stiff and soft regions not only enhanced mechanical recovery but also showed physiological functionality. The CHs rings, with their higher compressive modulus, provided structural support, while the FBs rings, with their lower modulus, allowed for flexibility and adaptation. This anisotropic design closely mimics the natural mechanical behavior of the native trachea, ensuring both mechanical strength and physiological adaptability.",
        "The linear elastic model utilized in FEA simulations was validated for physiological relevance within the applied strain range of ≤60 %. This threshold aligns with three key benchmarks: native tracheal strain ≤50 % [1], GelMA linear elasticity ≤60 % [13], and SilMA quasi-linearity ≤65 % strain [32]. Collectively, these data confirm that the model accurately represents the mechanics of both engineered constructs and native tissues under simulated physiological loading.The alternating stiff (CHs) and soft (FBs) rings mimic natural tracheal mechanics. FEA simulations confirm stress distribution patterns. These patterns are essential for physiological adaptability, resolving mechanical mismatch issues observed in synthetic grafts [19]. The higher compressive modulus of GCGM-P compared to native cartilage suggests potential for enhanced load-bearing capacity, while GSGM-P's flexibility ensures dynamic respiratory forces. This approach builds on Zhou et al.’s work [[24], [25], [26]] but introduces dynamic adaptability through GM-P integration, offering a clinically relevant advancement. While uniaxial compression testing provided foundational data (e.g., compressive modulus, cyclic resilience) to compare the engineered CFT with native trachea, we acknowledge that this approach simplifies the complex mechanical environment of the trachea in vivo. Physiological respiratory pressures induce multidirectional loading, including cyclic radial distension and axial tension, which are critical for evaluating graft failure modes. Although the current linear elastic finite element analysis (FEA) and uniaxial tests do not account for the viscoelastic or strain-rate-dependent properties of the hydrogels, they provide a foundational understanding of stress distribution patterns under static loading, guiding iterative design optimization. Replicating dynamic physiological conditions requires advanced models and multiaxial testing protocols beyond the scope of this exploratory study. Future work will integrate dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and biaxial testing to characterize viscoelasticity, strain-rate dependency, and hyperelastic behaviors. These data will inform refined constitutive models for FEA, incorporating internal pressurization and dynamic stress states to bridge the gap between benchtop validation and clinical performance.",
        "To develop tissue-specific bioinks for 3D bioprinting of biomimetic trachea constructs, chondrocytes were mixed in GCGM-P gels to obtain cartilage-specific bioinks, while fibroblasts were mixed into GSGM-P gels to obtain fibrous tissue-specific bioinks. The cytocompatibility of these bioinks was assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays and live/dead staining (Fig. 3A and B). The results demonstrated that the photo-crosslinked natural polymers and their corresponding hydrogels (GCGM-P and GSGM-P) exhibited no obvious cytotoxic effects, which indicated excellent biocompatibility of the photo-crosslinked matrix hydrogels.Fig. 3Biological evaluation of tissue-specific matrix hydrogels.(A, B) CCK-8 assays (A) and live/dead staining (B) of chondrocyte-loaded GCGM-P and fibroblast-loaded GSGM-P bioinks cultured for 1, 4, and 7 days in vitro.

        "As shown in Fig. 3C, after 7 days, both fibroblasts and HUVECs in GSGM-P exhibited significant spreading, proving that open GelMA-SilMA network enhance cell spreading. In contrast, chondrocytes in GCGM-P exhibited limited lateral spreading compared to fibroblasts and HUVECs in GSGM-P, with a tendency to remain in situ. This behavior aligns with the dense GelMA-ChSMA network architecture, which may restrict long-range cell migration while still supporting local adhesion. These observations are consistent with the natural growth patterns of these cell types in vivo. Fluorescence images confirmed these findings. The limited morphological variation observed in fluorescence images may stem from the 3D hydrogel environment. Nonetheless, the functional outcomes (e.g., ECM deposition, gene expression) still validate the hydrogels’ ability to guide tissue-specific cellular responses. Future studies employing advanced imaging technique (e.g., confocal z-stacks) may further resolve spatial interactions within these constructs.",
        "Quantitative morphometric analyses revealed distinct cell spreading behaviors across hydrogel conditions (Fig. 3D). Chondrocytes in GCGM-P achieved localized spreading with significantly larger cell areas (31.36 ± 8.19 μm2) compared to 10 % GelMA (14.63 ± 7.62 μm2, p < 0.01). This suggests that the GCGM-P network, despite its dense architecture, provides adhesion-supportive niches to promote chondrocyte-matrix interactions, consistent with their native tissue behavior. Similarly, fibroblasts in GSGM-P showed greater spreading (28.71 ± 7.89 μm2) than in 10 % GelMA (23.30 ± 6.63 μm2, p < 0.05), while HUVECs in GSGM-P demonstrated superior elongation (20.24 ± 10.05 μm2 vs. 16.52 ± 7.13 μm2, p < 0.05). These data corroborate the fluorescence imaging and SEM observations, validating the tissue-specific regulatory functions of GCGM-P and GSGM-P.",
        "The differential cell spreading and motility witnessed in GCGM-P and GSGM-P hydrogels can be ascribed to their distinct mechanical characteristics. Substrate stiffness plays a crucial role in regulating cell migration, where softer matrices typically enhance cell motility [46,47]. In this study, the significantly lower compressive modulus of GSGM-P (13.4 ± 1.4 MPa) promoted extensive spreading and dendritic extensions of fibroblasts and HUVECs, thereby facilitating matrix infiltration. In contrast, the rigid GCGM-P hydrogel (58.7 ± 4.2 MPa) constrained the lateral movement of chondrocytes, favoring a stationary, matrix-synthesizing phenotype that is essential for cartilage regeneration.",
        "To further clarify the structural compatibility and cell-matrix interactions within the hydrogels, SEM imaging was taken on freeze-dried GCGM-P, GSGM-P, and control GelMA samples loaded with chondrocytes and fibroblasts (Fig. 3E). The GCGM-P hydrogels showed a dense, interconnected porous network with an average pore size of 272.6 ± 47.38 μm, while GSGM-P showed a more open architecture with larger pores (347.6 ± 56.36 μm). These distinct microstructural features directly correlated with the differential cell behaviors observed in previous assays. Most chondrocytes in GCGM-P were localized within the smaller pores, adopting rounded morphologies consistent with their native phenotype. In contrast, fibroblasts in GSGM-P demonstrated extensive spreading and dendritic extensions by the larger pore dimensions and elastomeric SilMA network. Control GelMA, lacking tissue-specific modifications, showed irregular pore structures and limited cell-matrix integration, with cells exhibiting flattened or contracted morphologies.",
        "To validate the tissue-specific bioactivity of our hydrogels, we performed cross-comparison experiments using q-PCR (Fig. 3F). Chondrocytes cultured in GSGM-P exhibited significantly reduced expression of chondrogenic markers (COL II, ACAN, SOX9) compared to those in both GCGM-P and plain GelMA (p < 0.05). Similarly, fibroblasts cultured in GCGM-P showed suppressed fibrogenic (α-SMA, FAP, vimentin gene expression compared to their counterparts in GSGM-P and GelMA (p < 0.05). Notably, HUVECs in GSGM-P demonstrated superior angiogenic (CD31, VEGF) expression (GSGM-P > GCGM-P > GelMA), with GCGM-P outperforming GelMA (p < 0.05). This improvement in GCGM-P over GelMA is attributed to the GM-P copolymer, which introduces bioactive RGD motifs and dynamic self-healing properties that stabilize the microenvironment, mitigate shear stress, and enhance endothelial adhesion and tubulogenesis. Collectively, these results underscore the ability of GCGM-P and GSGM-P to provide tissue-specific mechanical and biochemical cues—chondroitin sulfate in GCGM-P promotes cartilage regeneration, while elastin-rich GSGM-P supports fibrous and vascular tissue maturation. All these results suggest that our photocrosslinked matrix hydrogels support cell survival, proliferation, and spreading, while showing distinct tissue-specific regulatory functions based on diverse mechanical and biological microenvironments.",
        "While GCGM-P's pore size (272.6 ± 47.38 μm) theoretically permits cell migration, its high stiffness (58.7 ± 4.2 MPa) and ChSMA-mediated receptor binding likely restrict chondrocyte motility, favoring a stationary, matrix-synthesizing phenotype [8]. In contrast, GSGM-P's lower stiffness (13.4 ± 1.4 MPa), SilMA-derived RGD motifs, and dynamic GM-P bonds collectively promote fibroblast spreading and migration, despite comparable pore dimensions. These findings align with studies demonstrating that cell behavior is orchestrated by the interplay of pore architecture, mechanics, and biochemical cues [46,47].The distinct cell behaviors in GCGM-P and GSGM-P reflect the hydrogels' tissue-specific bioactivity. Chondrocytes in GCGM-P retain a rounded morphology, essential for cartilage ECM deposition, while fibroblasts in GSGM-P showed well spreading for fibrous tissue formation [27,28]. These findings contrast with control GelMA lacking microenvironmental cues, highlight the necessity of functionalized bioinks [29,30].",

Over a period of 14 days, P0 generation MSCs showed characteristic spindle-shaped morphology during adherent growth (Fig. 4B).

        "Biomimetic chondro-fibrous trachea (CFT) was printed based on the printability and structural accuracy. For GCGM-P (cartilage-specific) and GSGM-P (fibrous tissue-specific) bioinks, extrusion parameters were fine-tuned under controlled temperature (19 ± 1 °C). This temperature was selected based on literature-reported optimal ranges for GelMA-based hydrogels (15–20 °C) to balance viscosity and cell viability [33]. Specifically, preliminary trials tested temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25 °C, evaluating extrusion continuity, structural collapse, and post-printing cell survival. At temperatures below 17 °C, excessive viscosity caused nozzle clogging, while temperatures above 21 °C accelerated gelation instability and reduced shape fidelity. 19 ± 1 °C emerged as the optimal compromise, ensuring smooth extrusion while maintaining hydrogel integrity and cell functionality [34,35].",

Histological examination revealed tissue-specific structures characterized by cartilage and fibrous tissue ingrowth. The reconstructed trachea showed a typical lacunar architecture, with deposition of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix in the cartilaginous regions and mature fibrous tissue and vascular infiltration in the fibrous tissue areas (Fig. 7C and D).",
        "The elevated compressive modulus of the CFT (96.5 ± 4.2 MPa) was designed to provide temporary mechanical reinforcement during early regeneration, preventing collapse under respiratory forces. Post-implantation, GM-P's controlled degradation and host-cell-driven ECM remodeling are expected to gradually restore native-like compliance.Although the regenerated tracheal cartilage partially overlapped with the native trachea, this integration was achieved by the formation of regenerated fibrous tissue (Fig. 7E). Additionally, staining for tracheal epithelial cells within the lumen of the regenerated trachea confirmed successful regeneration of the epithelial tissue, which is critical for restoring physiological function.",
        "As shown in Fig. 7F, by comparing the ciliated cells and surrounding tissues of the native trachea with those of the regenerated trachea, we found that although the regenerated trachea exhibited a pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium and a lamina propria rich in elastic fibers similar to the native trachea, it was notably deficient in the submucosa containing lymphatic vessels and mixed glands. This suggests that while the epithelialization of the regenerated trachea primarily restores the defense and clearance functions of the ciliated epithelium, the secretory function of the mucosal glands remains significantly limited [42,43].",
        "In addition to the findings above, we observed defects and resorption of cartilage and matrix, localized accumulation of fibrous and endothelial tissues. The texture of regenerated CFT samples were also hard to obtain ideal sections during histological processing. These issues are primarily attributed to the inflammatory response following local tracheal repair and the rejection reaction by human-derived cells, which will be a critical focus in the next phase of research [44,45].",
        "Successful anastomosis in rabbits validates clinical feasibility, but epithelialization without submucosal glands highlights incomplete regeneration. This suggests challenges in mucosal gland engineering [22]. Immunomodulatory strategies, such as GM-P's anti-inflammatory potential, may reduce rejection responses to human-derived cells, to be studied in further investigation [42].",
        "Furthermore, the stiffness-mediated regulation of cell behavior highlights the significance of biomechanical cues in tissue-specific regeneration. The high modulus of GCGM-P (58.7 ± 4.2 MPa) sustained chondrocytes in a low-motility state that was conducive to the deposition of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). In contrast, the softer GSGM-P (13.4 ± 1.4 MPa) facilitated fibroblast migration and the organization of fibrous tissue. These findings are consistent with well-established mechanotransduction principles, according to which matrix stiffness guides cell motility and phenotypic commitment [46,47].",
        "Overall, this study demonstrated the feasibility and potential advantages of using 3D bioprinted biomimetic tracheal constructs for rapid and efficient tracheal reconstruction, offering an alternative therapy for segmental tracheal defect repair. This approach opens up a new way for the field of tracheal tissue engineering and regenerative medicine [45].",
        "This study introduces a biomimetic tracheal engineering strategy centered on a self-healing glucomannan-peptide copolymer (GM-P), which addresses critical implanting challenges in vascular integration and mechanical adaptability. By applying GM-P into tissue-specific hydrogels, we engineered anisotropic constructs that mimic native tracheal architecture, combining cartilaginous stiffness with fibrous flexibility. The GM-P copolymer not only enhances interfacial cohesion and shear-thinning printability but also actively promotes vascular network formation through sustained angiogenic signaling without exogenous growth factors [14,24].",
        "Subcutaneous and rabbit tracheal implantation validated the constructs' ability to restore structural integrity, epithelialization, and load-bearing functionality. Utilizing iPSC-derived chondrocytes, this platform offers new patient-specific solutions for tracheal defects, contrasting common grafts limited by passive vascularization and donor cell scarcity [31,36]. Notably, future advancements could further improve cell sourcing by reprogramming patient-derived fibroblasts into iPSCs, enabling the generation of all necessary cell types (e.g., chondrocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells) from a single autologous source. This approach would reduce immune rejection risks and enhance clinical feasibility by fully utilizing the patient's own cells.",
        "While the current work confirms the biomimetic design and mechanical compatibility of the CFT under simplified loading conditions, advancing toward clinical translation necessitates more complex mechanical evaluations. Future studies will focus on dynamic physiological loading simulations, including cyclic respiratory pressures and multiaxial stress analyses, to bridge the gap between theoretical validation and in vivo performance. These efforts will further refine the graft's resilience under failure-critical problems, ensuring its readiness for clinical trials.",
        "Although challenges in submucosal regeneration persist, the GM-P framework offers new ideas for future innovations, such as immunomodulatory strategies or decellularized matrix hybrids [42,45]. Future iterations will incorporate stiffness gradients to better replicate the trachea's anisotropic mechanics, while long-term studies will evaluate dynamic modulus reduction and physiological integration. By demonstrating the functional synergy between GM-P's self-healing properties and iPSC-derived cellular components, this study provides a blueprint for transitioning tracheal engineering from theoretical biomimicry to clinically actionable solutions.",

        "Cleft lip alone, or in occurrence with the cleft of the palate (CL/P), is the most common developmental anomaly in the craniofacial region, with an estimated incidence of around 1 in 700 infants born alive [1]. Clefts occur during the fourth stage of development. The locations at which the fusion of different developmental processes fails to occur indicate the impacted site. A cleft lip develops due to failure in the fusion of the frontonasal and maxillary processes, and failure in the fusion of the secondary palatal shelves of the maxillary process leads to a cleft palate [2]. Based on the International Perinatal Database of Typical Orofacial Clefts (IPDTOC), a total of 9.92 cases of cleft lip per 10,000 births, with or without cleft palate, was reported. A total of 3.28 per 10 thousand people had an isolated cleft lip, while 6.64 per 10 thousand people had a cleft lip and palate association [3].",
        "Although genetic factors are a major contributor to the etiology of cleft lip and palate, external factors such as hormonal imbalance, drug use, malnutrition, exposure to toxins, and a variety of other biological factors are also involved in their etiology [4,5]. There are regional and national differences in the overall incidence of orofacial clefts. Racial and cultural diversity, differences in climatic conditions, and variations in programs for the care of expectant mothers could all contribute to this disparity [6]. These patients are prone to various complications, including psychosocial distress due to compromised esthetics, speech and hearing impairments, and feeding difficulties [7].",
        "The therapeutic journey for cleft lip and/or palate patients begins as early as three months old, involving numerous maxillofacial reconstructions, with the first being lip repair. Palatal closure surgery is meticulously determined by the surgeon and is typically performed when the child is between six and twelve months old [8,9,10].",
        "Using stem cells in cleft therapy has a promising effect on bone regeneration and is considered an adequate alternative to conventional bone grafting techniques. Clonogenic cells with the capacity to divide, multiply, and differentiate are identified as stem cells. Adult stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and embryonic stem cells are the three distinct categories of stem cells [11]. Adult stem cells are multipotent or unipotent and are found in different tissues, including the skin, blood, intestine, muscle, heart, and brain. Their main function is maintaining tissue hemostasis, and in case of injury or loss of cells, they can proliferate and self-renew themselves [12]. Adult stem cells are divided into hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells [13]. By genetically modifying adult somatic stem cells to transform into embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be created [14]. iPSC-derived tissues closely resemble the cell donor, which is a critical factor in disease modeling and drug screening research [13]. Furthermore, non-hematopoietic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess multipotency and can differentiate into the mesodermal (osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes), ectodermal (neurocytes), and endodermal (hepatocytes) lineages [15].",
        "MSCs are a type of stem cell that is widely studied in the field of regenerative drugs and are found in copious quantities in adipose tissue. Following liposuction or lipectomy, they can be exfoliated via aspiration [13]. Because of their diverse spectrum of differentiation potentials, adipose stem cells have been considered for application in the field of regenerative medicine, specifically in relation to bone regeneration. One of their main applications is orofacial bone regeneration [13].",
        "Most embryonic stem cells originate from fertilized eggs in a vitro clinic, rather than naturally fertilized eggs in vivo clinics [16]. The groundbreaking discovery of iPSCs enabled researchers to ethically experiment on pluripotent stem cells without the need to face controversies regarding the use of embryos [17]. There are numerous disagreements when it comes to the gold standard among stem cells. Bone marrow stem cells are by far the most-often-employed stem cells to treat patients with cleft palates. Bone marrow stem cells consist of both hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells and are harvested from the iliac crest or sternum [18]. According to some authors, embryonic stem cells are still widely regarded as the “gold standard” [19]. However, some other authors believe that, from an ethical and moral standpoint, adult embryonic stem cells are recognized as the gold standard of care in clinical trials. According to Prentice, adult stem cells are the real gold standard in regenerative medicine [20]. Adult stem cells and MSCs are present throughout the body and were first discovered by Friedenstein in 1976. These cell source, which was originally discovered in bone marrow, is believed to be the best for clinical research according to him [21]. Another study mentioned that, based on their multipotency and capacity for renewal, bone marrow MSCs are presently the gold standard [22]. However, according to another study, a comparison is also made between adipose stem cells and bone marrow stem cells, which are still regarded as the gold standard of stem cells [23]. Mesenchymal stem cells generated from bone marrow are considered gold-standard osteoprogenitors according to studies by Le et al. However, they also argued that several factors related to bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapies remain unclear, such as the use of pure cell preparations, the substantial number of cells needed to accomplish satisfactory healing, the need for growth factor supplementation, and the incomplete healing of fractures in many patients. Further disadvantages that discourage interest in their therapeutic application involve the invasive nature of isolating mesenchymal stem cells, their extremely low frequency in bone marrow, and the need for copious quantities to promote bone regeneration. Hence, they mentioned that, as opposed to BMMSCs, adipose-derived stem cells have the following benefits: adipose-derived stem cells have a greater proliferative capacity, can be separated in large quantities using a straightforward process, and can hold onto their differentiation potential for an extended amount of time [24]. A “golden approach” cannot be identified because of the variety of study designs, and not all studies produced satisfactory results. However, most studies mentioned adult stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, as the recent gold standard that could be used without facing ethical controversies. The study aims to examine the role and effectiveness of stem cells in the treatment of cleft lip and palate (CLP) and highlight areas that require further investigation and improvement.",

        "The search and study selection processes were conducted by two reviewers (A.A. and R.E.). In case of any disagreement on a study’s eligibility, it was resolved by a third reviewer (M.J.). Initial screening based on titles and abstracts was independently performed by the reviewers, followed by a subsequent assessment of full texts for potential inclusion. Any disagreements during this process were resolved with the third reviewer.",
        "Three reviewers (P.P., A.A., and R.E.) initially screened the titles and abstracts relevant as per the inclusion criteria. The PRISMA flow chart recorded the data collection.

A fourth reviewer, M.J., evaluated the studies with disagreement. All the finalized articles were included in Table 2. The risk of bias in the included studies is shown in Figure 2.",
        "This study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42024566111). This work is an umbrella review of several systematic reviews with varying techniques for treating the clefts.",
        "Figure 1 portrays a flowchart illustrating the technique used in this umbrella review. A thorough search of multiple databases yielded 70 articles. After screening based on title and abstract, 15 full-text papers were evaluated for eligibility. Following the first screening, six publications were eliminated for several reasons. Two of them were irrelevant to the current study, while one focused only on animal studies. Furthermore, three studies presented interventions that did not focus solely on stem cells. These exclusions were critical in refining the selection process, ensuring that only relevant and appropriate studies were included for further analysis. Five systematic reviews underwent qualitative analysis.",
        "A systematic review by Badr et al. investigated adipocyte stem cells (ADSCs) used in the treatment of cleft lip and palate. Four studies were included. The study yielded important findings regardless of the limited number of articles included, suggesting promising outcomes in managing cleft patients. The evidence was not enough to warrant its routine use by oral surgeons; however, their efficiency in bone regeneration and reconstruction has been highlighted in the study. However, the study highlighted the potential of tumor formation from the human ADSCs and recommended that their safety testing be mandatory [25].",
        "Abbasi et al., in a systematic review, investigated various uses of stem cells in dentistry and described their current state in intraoral applications, and included 172 studies, 16 of which are human studies. Insufficient human studies exist involving stem cell therapy for dental regeneration. Clinically, researchers were able to regenerate periodontal-like tissue, bone, and pulp-like tissue, but complete tissue regeneration is still difficult. The study concluded that stem cell treatment in dental applications has been notably promising. Combining in vitro osteogenic-differentiated human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs) with recombinant platelet-derived growth factor enhanced bone regeneration, particularly during alveolar cleft repair [26].",
        "Sepanta and colleagues’ goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of various scaffolds when combined with growth hormones and stem cells in both human and animal models. Among the 46 studies reviewed, combining scaffolds, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and growth factors resulted in considerable bone repair. Notably, employing human bone marrow MSCs in conjunction with calcium sulfate resulted in bone regeneration rates of 35.4% and 25.6% after four months. Furthermore, HA/TCP loaded with MSCs and platelet-rich growth factor demonstrated a 51.3% mean bone formation after three months and a comparable bone formation (41.34%) after 12 months. Furthermore, combining PDGF with HA/TCP and MSCs improved bone growth in anterior maxillary clefts [27].",
        "Martín et al. systematically reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of stem cells for bone repair in individuals with alveolar bone atrophy. Their study comprised seven human clinical studies. Various stem cell sources were employed in these studies, including bone marrow-derived MSCs and adult stem cells from sources like the iliac crest. All research successfully achieved bone regeneration utilizing stem cells, but with varying methods and outcomes. It was concluded that tissue-engineering therapy using stem cells to rehabilitate patients with bone atrophies is successful according to the reviewed research [28].",
        "A comprehensive evaluation of the literature was conducted by Fatmah et al. Nine research papers were included in this systematic review, the majority of which described the use of various types of stem cells to effectively treat cleft lip and palate. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to be the most effective form of stem cell, followed by adipose stem cells, in the treatment of cleft lip and palate and bone regeneration. However, other types of stem cells have also demonstrated encouraging outcomes [29].",
        "This umbrella review aims to offer an overview of the current landscape of stem cell therapy in treating cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients, specifically focusing on bone regeneration. Despite the limited number of studies available, significant findings have been highlighted, particularly regarding the efficiency of stem cells in bone regeneration.",
        "The most effective course of treatment is surgical repair, which offers the best long-term functional and cosmetic results. However, it usually requires several procedures and relies on the surgical team’s expertise and timing. Speech therapy and orthodontic treatment are essential adjuncts that optimize the benefits of surgery. Prosthetic devices may improve quality of life, but they are only meant to be temporary fixes. Psychosocial support deals with the emotional and social difficulties related to CLP and is a crucial part of holistic care [8,9,10]. The anomaly can be successfully treated by the presented non-stem cell treatments for CLP, and stem cell therapy proves to be promising in the future.",
        "Overall, the use of stem cells has shown positive outcomes. However, the most used type of stem cell was mesenchymal stem cells. In all five studies, it was proven that mesenchymal stem cells were the most effective. Martín et al. noted that MSCs, bone marrow-derived MSCs, stem cell culture-conditioned medium (MSC-CM), adult stem cells from the iliac crest, and bone marrow -derived MSCs, along with platelet-rich plasma used for alveolar bone repair, have successfully achieved bone regeneration [28]. Additionally, a study by Sepanta et al. reported that the use of mesenchymal stem cells and growth factors led to considerable bone repair [27]. Likewise, in a notable study by Abbasi et al., important insights into enhancing bone regeneration by the combination of recombinant platelet-derived growth factor and in vitro osteogenic-differentiated human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs) were demonstrated particularly in the repair of alveolar cleft defects. However, most studies included in this research were animal studies, with a limited number of human studies. It was concluded that more clinical follow-ups were essential to demonstrate the credibility of stem cell therapy when used orally [26]. Supporting that, it was stated by Berebichez-Fridman and Montero-Olvera, as well as Nancarrow-Lei et al., that bone marrow-derived MSCs are considered the gold standard of mesenchymal stem cells as they exhibit multipotency and renewal capacity [21,22]. Furthermore, Fatmah et al.’s study reported that several types of stem cells effectively treated cleft lip and palate [29]. It has been proven that mesenchymal stem cells were the most effective, followed by adipose stem cells. Also, the systematic review by Badr et al. noted promising outcomes in the management of cleft patients [25]. However, more advanced clinical trials are required to provide us with reliable information about the application of ADSCs in the treatment of cleft palates. Adipocyte stem cells have been compared with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, as reported by Rada, Reis, and Gomes. Even though they may be easily obtained from both sources, bone-derived MSCs are still regarded as the gold-standard osteoprogenitors [23]. On the contrary, George T.-J. Huang stated that embryonic stem cell features have been regarded as the gold standard in pluripotent stem cell-based regenerative therapy [30]. The absence of identical genetics between donor and recipient cells is the most significant disadvantage of human ES cells for therapeutic use. iPS cells overcome this challenge. More critically, many genetic illnesses are uncommon and lack animal research models. Custom iPS cells may be developed from patients and investigated utilizing in vitro or in vivo techniques. As mentioned before, IPSCs do not face controversies like embryonic stem cells. They can differentiate into embryonic stem cells [31]. Although their molecular equivalency is still questioned, it raises the need to further research their use and effectiveness. However, they have the potential to make a valuable change in the field of stem cells. Most studies emphasized the need for further investigation and more clinical follow-ups. Some also mentioned that its effectiveness, predictability, safety testing, and a standardized protocol are required to provide us with reliable evidence concerning stem cell use in cleft lip and palate patients.",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) emerged as the most used type of stem cells across the reviewed studies. Martín et al. demonstrated successful bone regeneration using various MSC sources, including bone marrow-derived MSCs and stem cell culture-conditioned medium [28].",
