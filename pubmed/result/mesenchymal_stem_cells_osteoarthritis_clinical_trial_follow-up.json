        "Significance StatementThis study was designed as a prospective, randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled trial in patients with knee osteoarthritis. All procedures were performed in the outpatient clinic setting. Only intra‐articular injection was applied, without surgical intervention and concomitant injection.

        "In osteoarthritis, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are gaining popularity as a disease‐modifying treatment because of their ease of harvesting, safety 1, 2, and potential to differentiate into cartilage tissue 3, 4, 5. Furthermore, MSCs have been known for paracrine 6, 7, 8, anti‐inflammatory 9, 10, and immunomodulatory effects 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 through the release of several growth factors and cytokines 1, 2, 16. Because the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis is based on both degeneration and inflammation, the paracrine effect, reducing of immune response, and stimulation of local tissue repair with the properties of MSCs would be beneficial to improve the intra‐articular environment as a disease‐modifying treatment 11, 12, 17, 18. Successful pain relief, functional improvement, and even cartilage regeneration have been reported in clinical studies of the intra‐articular injection of MSCs for knee osteoarthritis 1, 2, 16, 19. However, besides the study of Vega et al. 16, most studies were not randomized or blinded and did not have a comparative group 1, 2, 19. Some previous studies used allogeneic MSCs 16, 20, and their use has been concerning because of the theoretical potential for adverse effects such as tumorigenesis or host immune rejection when compared with autologous MSCs, although no severe adverse effects have been reported. Our previous phase I/IIa trial 2 reported the clinical efficacy and safety after using an intra‐articular injection of autologous adipose tissue‐derived MSCs (AD‐MSCs) with high dose (1 × 108 cells). However, the study 2 performed the intra‐articular injection of AD‐MSCs after arthroscopic lavage procedure in the operating room. Therefore, there might be performance bias as clinical and structural improvements would be affected by surgical procedures. In addition, there was an open label test without control group 2.",
        "Therefore, we conducted a current phase IIb clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a single intra‐articular injection of high‐dose (1 × 108 cells), autologous AD‐MSCs in patients with knee osteoarthritis through randomized, double‐blinded, and placebo‐controlled study in the outpatient setting, without limitation of daily activity. We report the clinical and radiological outcome after a single intra‐articular injection of autologous AD‐MSCs.",
        "The present study was performed between June 2015 and December 2016 in two orthopedic centers. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of both institutes, and Korea Food and Drug Administration. This was designed as a randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled study in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Eligible patients were between 18 and 75 years of age with osteoarthritis of the knee joint (Kellgren‐Lawrence grade 2 to 4) 21 and had an mean pain intensity of 4 or more on a 10‐point visual analog scale (VAS) for at least 12 weeks (supplemental online Appendix 1). Patients underwent physical examination; laboratory tests such as routine blood and urine tests, serologic test, tumor screening, electrocardiogram, and pregnancy test if indicated; and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee at screening with informed consent. To objectively assess cartilage regeneration, we enrolled patients with at least one focal or localized grade 3 or 4 lesion on MRI scan. All pain medications were discontinued except the rescue analgesic. All participants who were identified as eligible for clinical trials returned to the hospital within 1 week for lipoaspiration. All lipoaspiration procedures were performed in the outpatient clinic. According to the randomization, participants were blindly assigned to AD‐MSCs injection (MSC group) or normal saline injection (control group). Three weeks after lipoaspiration, one of autologous AD‐MSC injection or normal saline injection was administered intra‐articularly in the outpatient clinic. No specific physical limitation was recommended from the day after the injection. Patients were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months after the injection. At each visit, the efficacy and safety evaluation were performed. Furthermore, simple radiograph and MRI of the knee were obtained at 3 and 6 months after the injection in all patients. The rescue analgesic was defined as an approved medication for patients' pain control. The rescue medication that was permitted was acetaminophen at a dose of 4,000 mg or less per day. Other analgesics were not permitted, and any medications that patients were taking were recorded. If the participant had an osteoarthritis medication, the drug was discontinued for 2 weeks as a wash‐out period.",
        "All the procedures were performed with an informed consent. AD‐MSCs (Jointstem; R‐Bio, Seoul, Korea) used in the current study were isolated and cultured based on a previously reported study 22. Adipose tissues of patients were obtained by lipoaspiration from abdominal subcutaneous fat under Good Manufacturing Practices conditions. Lipoaspiration was performed using the tumescent technique, which was defined as 3–5 cc of infiltrate per 1 cc of aspirate at 3 weeks before injection 23, 24. The process of lipoaspiration was as follows: (a) sterile skin preparation; (b) local anesthesia using 2% lidocaine; (c) stab incision (2 mm) using number 11 mass; (d) injection of tumescent solution into the subcutaneous fat layer of the harvesting site; (e) after 10–15 minutes, approximately 20 mL of adipose tissue was collected using an metal cannula connected to a 10 cc syringe; (f) the collected fat‐tumescent solution was kept at 2°C–8°C in a sterile bag and transported to the laboratory; and (g) wound suture (number 5 blue nylon) and dressing. Aspirated tissues were digested with collagenase I (1 mg/mL) under gentle agitation for 60 minutes at 37°C 22. The digested tissues were filtered through a 100‐mm nylon sieve to remove cellular debris and were centrifuged to obtain a pellet. The pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, USA)‐based media containing 0.2 mM ascorbic acid and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cell suspension was recentrifuged. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was collected. The cell fraction was cultured for 4–5 days in Keratinocyte‐SFM (Invitrogen, USA)‐based media containing 0.2 mM ascorbic acid, 0.09 mM calcium, 5 ng/mL recombinant epidermal growth factor (rEGF), and 5% FBS until confluent (passage 0). When the cells reached 90% confluency, they were passaged. AD‐MSCs from the control group were also cultured until passage 1. The cells were then frozen and stored at liquid nitrogen cell storage (−196°C), which might be the most common method of storing cells safely for a long period in most laboratories 25. All of the AD‐MSCs used in this study were collected at passage 3. Culture‐expanded cells were then tested for cell number, viability, purity (CD31, CD34, CD45), identity (CD 73, CD 90), sterility (bacterial and fungal), and endotoxin and mycoplasma contamination as recommended by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 (21CFR), before shipping. Cultured AD‐MSCs maintained a survival rate of more than 80% for 72 hours at 2°C–8°C 22. This high level of purity was demonstrated by the consistent expression of positive or negative surface antigen for MSC up to 72 hours. Thus, the cells were made and shipped on the day of injection, with a survival rate of at least 87% (average 92.8%) for 72 hours. And the MSCs were injected into the knee joint in the outpatient clinic within an hour after being delivered to the hospital.",
        "All injections were administered once into the patient's knee joint under the ultrasound guidance. Intra‐articular injection was performed by a specialized physician who was not involved in the entire evaluations of the participants. Also, neither the physician nor the patient was aware of who was receiving AD‐MSCs, hence double blinding the study. In the MSC group, 1 × 108 cells of AD‐MSCs in 3 mL of saline was administered intra‐articularly, and in the control group, 3 mL of saline (NaCl 9 mg/mL) was administered intra‐articularly under the ultrasound guidance. The dose of cell injection was determined by the result of the previous study 2.",
        "The clinical evaluation was performed by a blinded physician. Primary outcome was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) 26 at 6 months after intra‐articular injection.",
        "Secondary outcomes were categorized into clinical scores, physical examination, radiologic examination, and safety. Clinical scores included a 10‐point VAS for knee pain and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) 27. Physical examination included range of motion, quadriceps power, presence of joint effusion, presence of joint crepitus, presence of medial joint line tenderness, and presence of pes anserinus tenderness.",
        "Radiologic outcomes were measured with Kellgren‐Lawrence (K‐L) grade 21, joint space width of medial and lateral compartment 28, 29, and hip‐knee‐ankle (HKA) angle 30 using simple radiograph. MRI was evaluated before injection and 3 and 6 months after injection. MRI was performed using a 3.0‐T scanner (Achieva 3.0‐T; Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, Netherlands) with an 8‐channel knee coil. The maximum gradient strength was 80 mT/m, and the maximum slew rate was 100 mT/m/ms. The images were transferred digitally to a picture archiving and communication system (PiView STAR, Seoul, Korea). Radiologic measurements were performed using the electronic calipers and goniometer provided in the software.",
        "The size and depth of cartilage defects was also measured using MRI by two blinded musculoskeletal radiologists. Depth of the cartilage defect in MRI was classified according to the modified Noyes grading system 31. For calculating size of the cartilage defect in MRI, the maximum diameter of the cartilage defect with modified Noyes 31 grade 3 and 4 in each compartment was analyzed in the sagittal (anteroposterior) and coronal (mediolateral) images. Size of the cartilage defect was measured by multiplying the anteroposterior and the mediolateral diameter 2. If multiple defects existed in one compartment, the highest grade was selected. Calculated size of the cartilage defects was compared within each group and between both groups after the injection.",
        "The safety was analyzed with vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests (supplemental online Appendix 2), and adverse events. The severity of adverse events was based on the National Cancer Institute‐Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI‐CTCAE) 32. When adverse events occurred, the cause‐and‐relationship between injection and adverse events was recorded according to the World Health Organization‐Uppsala Monitoring Centre causality assessment system 33.",
        "Because the primary outcome was the difference in WOMAC score between baseline and 6 months, sample size was set based on the results of the previous study (α risk 0.05, power 0.8, changes in WOMAC score 21.3, and SD 19.12) 2. The required number of patients was determined to be five. Considering the representative clinical trial and dropout rate, we decided to recruit 12 patients in each group. Outcome measures were analyzed based on the intention‐to‐treat population. Data are reported as means ± SD. Unpaired t test was used to assess efficacy before and after injection, and McNemar's test or Bowker's test was used for categorical variables. The analysis was performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS institute, Inc., Cary, NC).",
        "Thirty‐three patients were assessed for eligibility, and 24 patients were enrolled: 12 patients in the MSC group and 12 patients in the control group through the randomization (Fig. 1).

        "The most important finding of this study was that a single intra‐articular injection of autologous AD‐MSCs in patients with osteoarthritic knees led to satisfactory clinical and functional improvement without adverse events over 6 months of follow‐up. All procedures were accompanied with the outpatient clinic setting. Patients in the MSC group demonstrated significantly improved WOMAC scores, which was the primary outcome of this study. This single injection of AD‐MSCs significantly led to a 55% reduction in the WOMAC total score, 59% in the WOMAC pain score, 54% in the WOMAC stiffness score, and 54% in the WOMAC physical function score at 6 months after injection. Previous studies 1, 2, 16, 19 showed that the clinical outcomes improved at 6 months after MSC injection. This is consistent with the results of this study. Moreover, similar to some previous studies 16, 19, clinical outcomes were well maintained even at 6 months after injection. This finding suggests that symptom improvement can be well maintained over 6 months with a single intra‐articular MSC injection. Therefore, intra‐articular injection of MSCs would be a viable option for the treatment of degenerative osteoarthritis of the knee as a simple method without concomitant surgical procedures, and it is able to be carried out in the outpatient clinic.",
        "Several types of MSCs have been used for an intra‐articular injection in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis 1, 2, 16, 19. Orozco et al. 1, 19 used autologous bone marrow (BM)‐derived MSCs for the intra‐articular injection. They reported significant improvement in clinical scores over 12 months after the injection. Vega et al. 16 performed a randomized controlled study of allogenic BM‐MSCs in patients with K‐L grade 2 to 4 osteoarthritis. They reported significantly improved pain and cartilage quality, but the efficacy for pain was smaller than that reported with autologous BM‐MSCs 1. However, direct comparisons are difficult because the former study 1 was uncontrolled. Both previous and present studies using high‐dose AD‐MSCs 2 showed similar improvements in pain VAS and WOMAC scores. In the previous study 2, a high dose of AD‐MSCs was injected after concomitant arthroscopy. In contrast, in the present study, a single intra‐articular injection of AD‐MSCs was performed in the outpatient setting. Moreover, whereas the previous study 2 was an open‐label test without a control group, the present study was a randomized, double‐blinded, and placebo‐controlled design. However, it is difficult to determine the actual differences in intra‐articular injections of BM‐MSCs and AD‐MSCs because the researches differ in study design, cell type, presence of adjunctive therapy, and rehabilitation protocols 1, 2, 5, 16, 19. Meanwhile, there are various options as to whether to use “autologous” or “allogeneic” MSCs for intra‐articular injection 5, 16, 34. Theoretically, autologous MSCs have been known to be safe because they do not result in antibody formation 5. The risk of tumorigenesis, disease transmission, and possibility of host immune rejection after use of allogeneic MSCs is still a concern 20. In contrast, donor site morbidity to harvest autologous MSCs would be a negative point compared with allogeneic MSCs 16. Moreover, autologous MSCs should not be recommended for genetic disorders 35. Rather, in patients with genetic disorders, allogeneic MSCs would be a reasonable option for the treatment 16, 35. In a previous study 16 using allogeneic MSCs for intra‐articular injections, few major adverse events were reported, and improvements in clinical outcomes were similar to studies using autologous MSCs 1, 2, 19. However, further clinical research including safety and efficacy evaluation would be necessary for clinical practice of an intra‐articular injection of allogeneic MSCs.",
        "Previous studies 1, 2, 16, 19 have reported chondral changes after the intra‐articular injection of MSCs in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Some studies 1, 16, 19 measuring structural changes after MSCs injection reported on cartilage regeneration at 6 months after injection using T2 relaxation time and poor cartilage index on MRI. In the previous study 2, cartilage regeneration could be seen in the second‐look arthroscopy at 6 months after the AD‐MSCs injection. In the present study, we could not find significant cartilage regeneration in MRI at 6 months after the injection. However, the cartilage defect was increased in the control group but maintained in the MSC group (p = .0051). Moreover, unlike the previous study that recommended partial weight‐bearing with crutches for 8 weeks after injection 2, we allowed normal daily activities without any restriction or support. Because Orozco et al. 19 reported a continuous improvement in cartilage quality over a 2‐year follow‐up from the baseline, we expect cartilage improvement in our series with a longer follow‐up. Chondral changes over time will require further research.",
        "Concerns about safety of MSCs remain among clinicians and patients. According to previous trials 16, 35, 36, 37, there were no major adverse events, but some patients commonly reported joint pain, swelling, and difficulty with movement in a temporary period. One previous systemic analysis 5 was performed with clinical trials on autologous BM‐MSCs. The literature found no serious adverse events with a mean follow‐up of 21 months. The evidences are consistent with the present study in that an intra‐articular injection of MSCs appeared to be safe during the short‐term period. Nonetheless, further research is necessary for mid‐ to long‐term adverse events.",
        "Our study had some limitations. First, a small number of patients participated in this randomized, double‐blinded, and placebo‐controlled study. It was performed as a pilot, phase IIb clinical trial, prior to multicenter and large cohort study in the phase III clinical trials. Second, because the WOMAC score was a primary outcome, this sample size is insufficient to adequately analyze the radiologic outcomes. Further larger sample size would be necessary to confirm these findings. Third, the follow‐up period was 6 months. There might be unexpected outcomes regarding clinical efficacy, adverse events, and structural outcomes in the long‐term follow‐up. In the future, long‐term studies with large sample sizes will be needed.",

        "Significance StatementThis paper reports the results of the first‐in‐human clinical trial investigating a stem cell‐based medicinal product called Cartistem (a composite of culture‐expanded allogeneic human umbilical cord blood‐derived mesenchymal stem cells and hyaluronic acid hydrogel). The application of the stem cell‐based medicinal product showed promising efficacy in terms of durable cartilage regeneration. Clinical outcomes were improved and stable, and no significant adverse events were observed over 7 years of follow‐up. There are currently no effective regenerative options for cartilage loss in osteoarthritis; thus, the researchers believe that this stem cell‐based medicinal product could provide a novel therapeutic option to regenerate worn cartilage lesions in osteoarthritis.

        "Articular cartilage has very limited capacity for self‐regeneration 1. Current treatment of cartilage defects in osteoarthritic patients is primarily palliative and includes medication and activity modification. The microfracture technique is applicable for repair of small‐ to mid‐sized cartilage defects in osteoarthritis, but results are suboptimal and cartilage tends to deteriorate within a few years 2, 3, 4. The application of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) to osteoarthritic knees is not routinely recommended in elderly patients because of accelerated cellular senescence and dedifferentiation of autologous chondrocytes during the culture expansion process 5.",
        "The use of stem cells has become a major interest in the field of regenerative medicine. Many human tissues, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood, and synovium, are well‐known sources of adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) 6. However, the effects of MSCs on cartilage regeneration are still under investigation. Although some reports are indicated to have studied the application of stem cell therapy in osteoarthritis, they have predominantly been the result of medical procedures and are described as exploring the application of “a heterogeneous cell population obtained from an autologous tissue containing uncertain portions or number of stem cells” 7, 8, 9. There have been only a few reports on the application of autologous stem cells (a homogeneous stem cell population that was isolated from an autologous tissue and expanded in culture) for the regenerative treatment of osteoarthritic cartilage defects 10, 11, 12. The procedure of harvesting autologous tissue to obtain stem cells is invasive and requires the patient to undergo two operations. We could not find a report in the literature describing the application of allogeneic stem cells (a homogeneous stem cell population that was isolated form an allogeneic tissue and expanded in culture) for the repair of cartilage defects in osteoarthritic patients.",
        "Human umbilical cord blood‐derived MSCs (hUCB‐MSCs) are isolated in a noninvasive manner and are also hypoimmunogenic 13. Furthermore, hUCB‐MSCs have shown high expansion capacity, which provides enough cells for therapeutic applications 14. Furthermore, we could not find any report in the literature on the long‐term safety and efficacy of allogeneic stem cells in human cartilage repair. Therefore, in this first‐in‐human clinical trial with extended duration of follow‐up, we aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of a novel medicinal product (a composite of allogeneic hUCB‐MSCs and hyaluronic acid [HA] hydrogel [Cartistem; Medipost, Seongnam‐si, Gyeonggi‐do, Korea, http://www.medi‐post.com]) for articular cartilage regeneration in patients with osteoarthritic knees.",
        "This study was an open‐label, single‐arm, single‐center, phase I/II clinical trial with a 24‐week follow‐up period. In addition, we performed long‐term follow‐up to assess safety and efficacy over 7 years. Patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee joint with Kellgren‐Lawrence (K‐L) grade 3 and painful full‐thickness cartilage defects (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade 4 lesions), which were not responsive to more than 6 months of palliative treatment, were eligible to participate. Other inclusion criteria were visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain between 40 and 60 mm during screening; a cartilage defect larger than 2 cm2; swelling, tenderness, and limited range of motion lower than grade 2; adequate blood coagulation activity; and adequate renal and hepatic function. Participants were excluded based on the following criteria: autoimmune or inflammatory joint disease; ligament instability higher than grade 2; a history of infection, surgery, or radiation therapy in the knee joint within the past 6 weeks; enrollment in any other clinical trial within the past 4 weeks; immunosuppressant use within the past 6 weeks; corticosteroid or viscosupplementation injection to the affected knee within the past 3 months; or current pregnancy or lactation.",
        "Two groups were studied to ensure safety of the participants and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on dose‐limiting toxicity (DLT) of the study medicinal product (a composite of allogeneic hUCB‐MSCs and HA hydrogel). The first three participants were assigned to receive low‐dose MSCs (group A), and the next three were assigned to receive high‐dose MSCs (group B) (Table 1). One participant in the low‐dose group did not consent to 12‐week arthroscopy; thus one more participant was assigned to receive low‐dose MSCs (group A) to fulfill the requirement for proceeding to the high‐dose trial. The doses and cell concentrations were selected based on previous animal studies 15. The allogeneic hUCB‐MSCs were transplanted at a dose of 500 µl/cm2 of the defect area with a cell concentration of 0.5 × 107 cells per milliliter. DLT was defined as any case with 2 or more of the following severe adverse reactions after transplantation: swelling, tenderness, limited range of motion, and pain of the knee joint. This study was reviewed and approved by the Korean Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the institutional review board at our institution (Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea). Informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment in this study.",
        "Baseline and treatment characteristics of study participants",
        "The medicinal product (hUCB‐MSCs‐HA hydrogel composite) was produced under Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines, which were approved by the regulatory authority, and provided as an investigational new drug by Medipost. Human umbilical cord blood was collected from umbilical veins at the time of neonatal delivery, with informed consent from the mother, and stored in a cord blood bank. The hUCB‐MSCs were isolated and characterized according to previously published methods 16. Mononuclear cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation at 550g for 30 minutes using a Ficoll‐Hypaque solution (density, 1.077 g/ml; Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com). Isolated mononuclear cells were washed, suspended in minimum essential medium (a‐MEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences, Waltham, MA, http://www.thermofisher.com) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, http://www.gelifesciences.com), and then seeded into culture flasks at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells per cm2. Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, with a change of culture medium twice per week. Colonies of spindle‐shaped cells formed approximately 2 weeks after plating. Cells were trypsinized (0.25% trypsin; GE Healthcare Life Sciences), washed, and resuspended in culture medium (a‐MEM supplemented with 10% FBS) when the monolayer of MSC colonies reached 80% confluence.",
        "A standard arthroscopic examination was performed to assess cartilage defects. Then, the cartilage defect site was exposed through a small longitudinal arthrotomy. Multiple drill holes (5 mm in diameter and 5 mm deep) were made approximately 2–3 mm apart at the cartilage defect site of the femoral condyle. The study drug (Cartistem) was implanted in the drill holes of the lesion from the base to the surface (supplemental online Fig. 1). In the case of a kissing lesion, the composite was only transplanted in the femoral lesion because of dose limitation in terms of cell numbers. The wound was then closed and a splint was applied.",
        "Patients were encouraged to perform quadriceps‐setting and straight leg‐raising exercises starting immediately after surgery. Active and active‐assisted range of motion exercise and nonweight‐bearing ambulation of the operated knee with a walking aid was started on postoperative day 1. Nonweight‐bearing ambulation was recommended for 12 weeks post‐transplantation to protect the repair tissue.",
        "Safety parameters included any abnormality found in the physical examination, vital signs, or laboratory studies as well as any adverse events (AEs). Adverse reactions in the knee joint were assessed by swelling, tenderness, active range of motion, and pain. Other AEs were categorized by the World Health Organization (WHO) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 17. The primary efficacy parameter was the cartilage status at 12 weeks post‐transplantation, which was assessed by an arthroscopic examination according to the ICRS cartilage repair assessment 18. Secondary efficacy parameters were the 100‐mm VAS score for pain on walking and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation form score. Safety and efficacy parameters were assessed during screening, immediately after transplantation, and at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks post‐transplantation per the initial protocol.",
        "During the 7‐year extended follow‐up period, safety assessments, assessment of the VAS score for pain and IKDC score, arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and histological evaluations were performed. The safety parameters, VAS score for pain, and IKDC score were evaluated at 1‐, 3‐, and 7‐year follow‐up visits. An independent research assistant administered the questionnaires on safety and efficacy. Secondary arthroscopy was performed at 1 year, which was evaluated by an independent surgeon. Histological assessment was performed at 1 year. The biopsy specimens taken during the secondary arthroscopy were stained with Masson's trichrome, Safranin O, and immunohistochemical staining for type II collagen, and were evaluated by an independent pathologist blinded to this trial. A delayed gadolinium‐enhanced MRI of the cartilage (dGEMRIC) was performed at 3 years post‐transplantation to evaluate the quality of the regenerated cartilage. A dGEMRIC measures the T1 relaxation time of the cartilage and involves the intravenous administration of negatively charged contrast agent (Gd‐DTPA2−). The distribution of Gd‐DTPA2‐ is inversely proportional to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content of the tissue of interest. Healthy cartilage, which contains an abundance of GAG, will show a low Gd‐DTPA2− concentration, whereas GAG‐depleted degraded cartilage will show a high Gd‐DTPA2− concentration. T1 relaxation times are inversely proportional to the concentration of Gd‐DTPA2−. The precontrast T1 relaxation time was calculated to evaluate the change in GAG content in the repair‐cartilage tissue. The T1 relaxation time was measured for 2 representative regions of interest (ROIs) in the same slice: the repair tissue area (ROI 1) and the healthy native cartilage (ROI 2). Quantitative R1, which represents the relaxation rate, is measured as 1/T1 (in 1/second). The change in R1 (ΔR1) was calculated as the difference between the precontrast and postcontrast R1. The ΔR1 represents the concentration of Gd‐DTPA2−. The ratio of ΔR1 in regenerated cartilage to ΔR1 in native cartilage is known as the relative ΔR1 index, which equals 1.0 in the case of perfect regeneration 19. The MRI scan was assessed by an independent musculoskeletal radiologist who was blinded to this study.",
        "Safety analyses were performed on all of the participants who received hUCB‐MSCs‐HA hydrogel composite transplantation. Efficacy analyses included all participants who had at least one efficacy parameter evaluated. The pre‐ and posttransplantation VAS score for pain and IKDC subjective scores were compared using the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, http://www.sas.com). P values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.",
        "Seven participants received a hUCB‐MSCs and HA hydrogel composite transplantation between November 2, 2005, and May 12, 2007 (supplemental online Fig. 2). The mean age of the participants was 58.7 years, and their mean BMI was 26.4 kg/m2. The average defect size was 4.9 cm2 in group A and 7.3 cm2 in group B. Group A participants were implanted with 1.15–1.25 × 107 hUCB‐MSCs, and group B participants were implanted with 1.65–2.00 × 107 hUCB‐MSCs according to the size of the articular cartilage defect. Six participants consented to join the extended follow‐up study after the 6‐month visit. One participant in group A opted out of the extended follow‐up study because she was satisfied with the current status of her knee and did not want additional examinations (Table 1).",
        "Mild to moderate AEs, but no serious AEs, were reported in five participants as follows: arthralgia, back pain, bladder distension, and elevated antithyroglobulin antibody level (Tables 2, 3). Only the elevated antithyroglobulin antibody level, which was classified as “increased infection susceptibility” according to the WHO criteria, was determined to be a treatment‐emergent adverse event (TEAE). An internal medicine specialist judged that it required no additional treatment, and it normalized spontaneously. No participant experienced DLT. Therefore, the higher dose was determined to be the MTD. In the extended follow‐up, no specific adverse reactions were observed in the six participants over 7 years. No participants underwent additional knee surgery or knee replacement conversion due to pain, aggravation, or functional impairment of the knee through the follow‐up period.",
        "Summary of treatment‐emergent adverse events by body system (all causalities)",
        "Incidence of treatment‐emergent adverse events",
        "Maturing repair tissue was observed at the 12‐week arthroscopic examination (supplemental online Table 1). In the extended follow‐up, two participants consented to the arthroscopic examination with biopsy at 1 year. The arthroscopic examination at 1 year revealed good resurfacing with thick and glossy white hyaline‐like cartilage at the lesion site. The regenerated cartilage had a smooth surface with firm consistency and also showed good integration with the surrounding native cartilage (Fig. 1). No bone formation or overgrowth was observed. The biopsy specimens were stained strongly with Masson's trichrome, Safranin O, and the immunohistochemical stain for type II collagen, which represents a similar histology to that of native hyaline cartilage (Fig. 2).",
        "Findings from secondary arthroscopy at 1 year after human umbilical cord blood‐derived mesenchymal stem cell‐hyaluronic acid hydrogel composite transplantation. (A): Good resurfacing was identified at the defect site. The defect site was resurfaced well with regenerated cartilage showing a smooth surface. Firm consistency of the regenerated cartilage was palpable with a probe. Good integration with the surrounding cartilage was also observed. The repair cartilage was assessed as grade 2 according to the International Cartilage Repair Society assessment criteria in this participant (ID: 007‐004). (B): A biopsy sample was taken from the regenerated cartilage, and fairly thick regenerated cartilage was recognizable at the biopsy site.",
        "Histological findings of the regenerated cartilage. The histologic analysis of the biopsy sample showed that the regenerated cartilage had a staining pattern similar to that of normal articular hyaline cartilage. A columnar alignment of chondrocytes with lacunae formation was observed at the regenerated cartilage. (A): Masson's trichrome staining showed abundant collagen staining. (B): Safranin O staining showed abundant glycosaminoglycan staining. (C): Immunohistochemical staining showed strong staining of type II collagen, which is typical in articular hyaline cartilage. The superficial region near the articular surface is less strongly stained with Masson's trichrome, Safranin O, and type II collagen antibody, and the deepest portion of the repair site was transformed to a subchondral bone, which is similar to the histological architecture of native articular cartilage. Scale bars = 200 µm (left), 100 µm (middle), and 50 µm (right).",
        "The 100‐mm VAS score for pain improved from 49.1 at pretransplantation to 19.3 at 24 weeks post‐transplantation (p = .018). The IKDC subjective score also improved from 39.1 at pretransplantation to 63.2 at 24 weeks post‐transplantation (p = .018) in all seven participants. These improved scores were maintained without significant deterioration up to 7 years (Fig. 3).",
        "Changes in VAS score for pain and IKDC subjective knee scores over the 7‐year follow‐up period. (A): The VAS score for pain was significantly improved in all participants at 3 months post‐transplantation (a result that may have been significantly affected by nonweight‐bearing ambulation for that period) and increased nonsignificantly at 6 months (p = .204). The improvement in pain at 6 months was maintained for 7 years. (B): The IKDC subjective knee score was improved significantly in all participants at 6 months. This improvement did not deteriorate significantly over 7 years. Abbreviations: IKDC, International Knee Documentation Committee; VAS, visual analog scale.",
        "Five participants consented to MRI evaluation at 3 years. The mean relative ΔR1 index was 1.44 (supplemental online Table 2), which indicated high GAG content of the regenerated cartilage (Fig. 4).",
        "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of cartilage regeneration 3 years after human umbilical cord blood‐derived mesenchymal stem cell‐hyaluronic acid hydrogel composite transplantation. (A): A cartilage defect of International Cartilage Repair Society grade 4 was detected at the medial femoral condyle by a preoperative MRI. (B): Cartilage regeneration at the defect site was observed at the medial femoral condyle at 3 years post‐transplantation. (C): The change in relaxation rate (ΔR1) in regenerated cartilage and ΔR1 in native cartilage were obtained at the marked areas to calculate the relative ΔR1. (D): A high glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content was observed in the regenerated cartilage by delayed gadolinium‐enhanced MRI of the cartilage. Higher T1 values (blue) are associated with increased relative GAG content, whereas lower T1 values (red) are associated with decreased GAG content.",
        "The results of this phase I/II clinical trial show that a novel stem cell‐based medicinal product (Cartistem), composed of allogeneic hUCB‐MSCs and HA hydrogel, had an acceptable efficacy and safety profile during the core trial phase and over extended follow‐up. No significant AEs or undesired effects such as overgrowth, osseous metaplasia, or tumorigenesis were observed during this study. One TEAE was reported (elevation of the antithyroglobulin antibody level) but normalized spontaneously. Arthroscopic examinations at 1 year showed well‐healed cartilage defect sites. The histological assessment at 1 year showed highly hyaline‐like cartilage. A dGEMRIC at 3 years showed persistent regenerated cartilage with high GAG content. The improved pain and function of participants did not show significant deterioration over 7 years of follow‐up.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first report of a clinical trial investigating an allogeneic stem cell‐based medicinal product (allogeneic hUCB‐MSC‐based therapeutics) for the regeneration of articular cartilage defects in osteoarthritic patients. As mentioned, there have been some studies that explored the application of stem cell therapy on osteoarthritis. However, upon closer inspection, these studies, for the most part, describe results of medical procedures using a heterogeneous cell population obtained from an autologous tissue containing an uncertain number of stem cells 7, 8, 9. The cell population obtained by these medical procedures contains variable numbers of autologous stem cells, which is less than 0.1% in the case of the bone marrow aspirate concentration procedure 20. We question whether the term “stem cell therapy” is acceptable for this kind of medical procedure containing only a small number of stem cells 8.",
        "Recently, there have been a few reports of actual stem cell therapy using autologous stem cells (a homogeneous stem cell population that was isolated from autologous tissue and expanded in culture) for the regenerative treatment of osteoarthritic cartilage defects 10, 11, 12. However, clinical use of allogeneic stem cells for cartilage regeneration has not been reported and, therefore, information on efficacy and safety is lacking. Although autologous BM‐MSCs have been extensively studied, the collection of autologous BM‐MSCs is invasive. More importantly, the number of MSCs obtained from harvested BM is very limited, especially in older patients 20. The hUCB‐MSCs have a higher proliferation rate, karyotype stability after prolonged expansion, and greater chondrogenic potential compared with BM‐MSCs 21. Moreover, hUCB‐MSCs have several additional advantages, including ease of availability from cord blood banks, noninvasive collection procedures, and hypoimmunogenic properties 22. There have been some preclinical studies that showed efficacy of hUCB‐MSCs for cartilage regeneration 15, 23, 24. Thus, we believe that hUCB‐MSCs are strong candidates for development of a novel stem cell‐based medicinal product for cartilage regeneration in osteoarthritic patients.",
        "Our study reveals that treatment with an allogeneic hUCB‐MSC product (Cartistem) is safe. Our results show no significant AEs or undesired effects over 7 years of follow‐up. None of the participants had substantial permanent morbidity, nor did any subjects discontinue the study prematurely after transplantation. Only one participant was lost in the long‐term extension phase, because she died of senile infirmity at 6 years post‐transplantation at the age of 76. We also found no evidence of abnormal findings suggesting rejection or infection. We believe that the characteristics of the hUCB‐MSCs such as hypoimmunogenicity and immunomodulatory activity 25, 26 contributed to the lack of rejection, despite their allogeneic use.",
        "Treatment with the new hUCB‐MSC–HA composite was associated with no detectable immunological issues and resulted in successful regeneration of articular cartilage, even in immunocompetent animals 15, 23, 24. The transplanted cells disappeared gradually from 4 to 8 weeks in rabbit and mini‐pig models 24. Other in vivo studies that investigated the fate of transplanted MSCs in osteoarthritis reported that labeled transplanted MSCs gradually disappeared in the regenerated tissue over time 27. We believe that the gradual disappearance of transplanted hUCB‐MSCs contributes to the long‐term safety of allogeneic transplantation of hUCB‐MSCs that we observed in our study. Currently, the mode of action of hUCB‐MSCs is understood to promote differentiation of endogenous chondroprogenitor cells by paracrine action 28. These findings support the use of allogeneic hUCB‐MSCs as a safe therapeutic option in the clinical setting that warrants further investigation to confirm the safety and efficacy in a larger patient population.",
        "The results of this study also suggest that the novel allogeneic stem cell‐based medicinal product results in good‐quality cartilage regeneration in osteoarthritis. The histological evaluation at 1 year revealed that the repair tissue was similar to native hyaline cartilage. At the 3‐year MRI assessment for the quality of repaired tissue, the average relative ΔR1 was 1.44 among the five participants studied, which suggests that the repaired tissue is comparable to healthy native cartilage. Previous reports indicate that relative ΔR1 was 1.32 at 1 year post‐ACI for focal chondral defects in nine patients (average age, 21.2 years) 19, and 1.13 and 1.55 at 1 year and 2 years, respectively, for postosteochondral allograft transplantation in nine patients (average age, 43.2 years) 29. Although the hUCB‐MSCs‐HA composite was transplanted at sites of osteoarthritic cartilage defects in elderly patients in this study, the relative ΔR1 of this study was comparable with that after ACI or osteochondral allograft transplantation in younger patients with focal chondral defects 19, 29. These results suggest that hUCB‐MSC–HA hydrogel composite transplantation may have a more favorable outcome than currently available cartilage repair methods.",
        "Another notable finding of this study is that the improvements in pain and function at 24 weeks post‐transplantation did not deteriorate significantly for 7 years. In addition, the participants enrolled in this study were patients with K‐L grade 3 osteoarthritis at baseline, but did not undergo any additional knee surgery or knee joint‐replacement surgery during the 7‐year follow‐up period post‐transplantation. These long‐term results are significant given that microfracture has been reported to provide short‐term improvement in knee pain and function for osteoarthritic cartilage lesions, but cartilage once again deteriorates after 1–2 years 30. This decline is attributed to the difference in durability of the fibrocartilage that results from microfracture compared with native hyaline cartilage 3. Therefore, the findings of our study are encouraging because current articular cartilage repair procedures are known to be unsatisfactory among elderly patients with large defects 5, 31, 32. In the present study, the repair site was restored with hyaline‐like cartilage tissue, which seemed to contribute to the observed persistence of the regenerated cartilage with durable improvement in pain and function. These findings suggest that the hUCB‐MSC–HA composite can be a stem cell‐based therapeutic product for the treatment of osteoarthritic cartilage defects.",
        "Limitations of this study should be considered. First, a small number of patients participated in this clinical trial. Small sample size is an inherent limitation of this type of phase I/II first‐in‐human clinical trial because the risk‐benefit ratio in humans is unknown. This study included surgical procedures and was the first in‐human clinical trial of the allogeneic UCB‐MSC product. Thus, the regulatory authority only allowed a small number of patients to participate with a dose‐escalation protocol. Second, there is no control group in this clinical trial. Because there was no optimal method for cartilage regeneration in osteoarthritis that could have been used as a control procedure and there were also concerns about making large‐bore drill holes (5 mm) at the subchondral bone without any additions, this clinical trial could not have been conducted with a control group. The microfracture technique using small‐bore drill holes (usually 1–2 mm) has resulted in deterioration within a few years 2, 3. Moreover, in our preclinical studies with hUCB‐MSCs, we found that hUCB‐MSC transplantation showed favorable cartilage regeneration compared with an untreated defect‐only control group 23, 24. Although this study has no control group (defect only), the safety and efficacy of hUCB‐MSCs for cartilage regeneration were verified in the long‐term extended follow‐up period. Third, this study could not evaluate cartilage repair in highly deformed knees. The participants in this study had K‐L grade 3 osteoarthritis; therefore, the lower extremity alignment was not severely deformed. Fourth, only two participants consented to the arthroscopic examination for biopsy at 1‐year post‐transplantation. The dGEMRIC, however, was performed in five participants, and demonstrated encouraging results in terms of quality of the repair tissue. Finally, the mode of action of the hUCB‐MSCs for the regeneration of articular cartilage is only partially understood 28.",
        "Application of the allogeneic hUCB‐MSCs‐based novel medicinal product appears to be safe and effective for the regeneration of durable hyaline‐like cartilage in osteoarthritic knees. The results of this study warrant further investigation of this novel therapeutic product in a larger number of patients.",

This trial provides evidence of safety and efficacy of a highly accessible allogeneic cell source that had not been tested in knee osteoarthritis, in spite of its well‐known biological advantages.

        "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease, leading to chronic pain, poor quality of life, and increased mortality 1, 2, 3. This imposes a major social burden due to elevated health care costs and premature workforce retirement 4, 5. However, despite decades of research, no true disease‐modifying OA drugs are described, and clinical effects of pharmacological interventions remain of short duration. In consequence, current aims have been directed toward the development of newer cell‐based therapies. Initial attempts aiming at joint repair with autologous chondrocytes 6, 7, thus requiring surgical harvest and implantation, have been in part replaced by the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), because they have both the capacity for self‐renewal and expansion, as well as inflammation‐dependent homing mechanisms associated with tissue restoring properties 8, 9, 10.",
        "In animal models of induced OA, from mouse to horse, MSC transplantation has been able to prevent, halt, or even reverse cartilage degradation 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Most human data from clinical series emerge from individuals with underlying OA‐predisposing conditions that require surgical intervention, such as meniscal tears or focal chondral defects (FCDs). In such cases, improvements in pain, histologic, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphologic scores have been noted 16, 17, 18.",
        "However, MSC therapy is also being assessed now in patients with diffuse knee OA. Indeed, three pilot studies of autologous cell therapy with bone marrow (BM)‐MSCs or adipose‐derived (AD)‐MSCs have been reported, suggesting early evidence of clinical efficacy at 6 months follow‐up 19, 20, 21. In addition, a single phase I trial has tested allogeneic BM‐MSCs, also reporting improvements in joint pain and function 22. Since we and others have shown that umbilical cord‐derived‐MSCs (UC‐MSCs) exhibit higher clonogenic, proliferative, and migration potential than BM‐MSCs, as well as improved secretion of relevant chondrogenic factors 23, 24, interest in UC‐MSCs as a more potent cell source suitable for allogeneic MSC‐based therapy has expanded 25. More than 3,000 patients have received allogeneic MSC treatment for different conditions, and no event linked to allo reactivity has been reported 26.",
        "We therefore decided to test this easily accessible and well‐characterized source of MSCs in a phase I/II controlled, randomized, triple‐blind trial, comparing single or double intra‐articular injection of UC‐MSCs, with an approved viscosupplementation treatment, in individuals with knee OA.",
        "The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02580695) and planned as a phase I/II randomized, double‐blind, controlled trial assessing the safety and efficacy of single or repeated doses of intra‐articular UC‐MSCs, compared with repeated doses of intra‐articular hyaluronic acid (HA) in patients with knee OA. It was approved prior to patient recruitment by a Chilean Ministry of Health Ethics Committee (CECSSMO131015) and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.",

Patients were excluded if they had bilateral symptomatic knee OA, condylar or tibial plateau generalized bone marrow edema on MRI, major axial deviation defined by valgus (>10°) or varus (5°) deformity of the involved leg, use of oral or intra‐articular steroids or hyaluronic acid in the past 6 months, ipsilateral hip or ankle pain, local or systemic infection, any form of secondary arthritis, previous malignancy, or body mass index ≥30. All randomized patients provided written informed consent.",

AEs were documented at each visit and described in terms of incidence, severity, and relatedness with intra‐articular infiltration. The secondary endpoint of the trial was efficacy, as assessed by the following validated clinical outcome scales: Western Ontario and Mc Master Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) Spanish validated version 27, Pain Visual Analog scale (VAS), Quality of life by the Short‐form 36 (SF‐36) questionnaire 28, Patient Global Assessment, and the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Committee (OMERACT)‐Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) Responder Index Criteria 29. WOMAC was registered according to Likert Scale version using the following descriptors for each item: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), and extreme (4). Final scores are the sum of items in each subscale, ranging 0–20 for pain, 0–8 for stiffness, and 0–68 for physical function.

Briefly, treatments were processed in an International Organization for Standardization 9001:2015‐certified Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)‐type Laboratory (Cells for Cells, Santiago, Chile), under GMP conditions according to the Food and Drug Administration Guidance for industry (current good tissue practice and additional requirements for manufacturers of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue‐based products). Umbilical cords were obtained from full‐term human placentas by cesarean section after informed consent, from healthy donors, and were aseptically stored in sterile phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, U.S.). Within 3 hours of birth, the umbilical cord was sectioned and washed with PBS and antibiotics. Wharton's jelly was dissected into small fragments (1–2 mm), seeded in 100‐mm culture plates, and maintained in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM) Alpha Modifications (Alfa‐MEM) high glucose (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, U.S.) supplemented with 10% heat‐inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, U.S.), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mM L‐glutamine (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, U.S.). At 48 hours, nonadherent cells were removed and washed with PBS, and culture medium was replaced with fresh medium every 3 days. When the cell culture reached 70%–80% confluence, cells were detached by treatment with TrypLE TM Express (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, U.S.) and reseeded at a density of 2,500 cells per cm2 into 500‐cm2 flasks (Nunc, Denmark). At passage 3, UC‐MSC were characterized according to the International Society for Cellular Therapy Guidelines 30, harvested, and cryopreserved in Profreeze (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) following the manufacturer's instruction. Cell size and doubling time, senescence markers, paracrine and immunomodulatory activity, and migration capacity of UC‐MSCs as compared with BM‐MSCs have been described elsewhere (RIMECARD trial) 23, 24. The protocol is patented by Cells for Cells, request number 201702357.",
        "For the trial, cells were thawed and expanded until passage 5 using Alfa‐MEM supplemented with 10% AB plasma. Cells were detached by treatment with TrypLE TM Express and washed twice with PBS prior to final suspension and packaging. The release criteria for clinical use of UC‐MSC comprised the absence of macroscopic clumps, contaminating pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, mycoplasma, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, cytomegalovirus, and fungi), or endotoxin (≤0.5 EU/mL); and a viability >80%, with an identity and purity pattern characterized by ≥95% positivity for CD73, CD90, and CD105, and negativity (≤2%) for the expression of CD45, CD34, CD14, and Human Leukocyte Antigen‐DR isotype (HLA‐DR).

No safety signals were detected in the experimental groups as compared with HA controls. At the end of the study follow‐up (12 months), the group with repeated UC‐MSC intra‐articular injections (20 × 106 every 6 months) experienced significant clinical changes in total WOMAC, pain component, and VAS when compared with HA (Table 3). Compared with baseline, only patients in the MSC groups experienced significant amelioration of pain and disability at 6 and 12 months of follow‐up as opposed to the control HA group (Fig. 3).

When cells were injected intra‐articularly, an increase in the expression of TNF‐α‐stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG‐6) was observed in the joint cartilage, with no expression in the control group. A reduction of metalloprotease A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS5) levels was evidenced as well. TSG‐6 has been reported as a mediator of the beneficial effect of MSCs in both cardiac and lung injury models of tissue damage. On the other hand, the expression of anti‐Calcitonin Gene‐Related Peptide in the C5 dorsal horn of the OA animals was also significantly decreased, indicating a suppressive effect on the central sensitization component of pain. Saulnier et al. 37 confirmed the reduced expression of metalloproteinases (1, 3, and 13) after MSC injection, but describe that MSC‐conditioned medium can also convey these anti‐inflammatory effects on OA synoviocytes. In sum, MSC treatments are known to induce potent anti‐inflammatory, tissue‐restoring, and analgesic effects that could explain the clinical findings described in recent trials as well as in the present phase I/II study.",
        "Indeed, the size of the effect for clinical response of the VAS score in this trial reached 0.81 for cell therapy, evidencing a high symptomatic impact, leading to a number needed‐to‐treat of only 2.1. Such an effect surpasses the usual findings reported for intra‐articular placebo or HA according to recent meta‐analyses 38, 39, 40. Somehow underscoring these effects, the OARSI clinical responder status was achieved by all (100%) MSC‐2 group patients at 6 and 12 months. This is usually achieved only in 50%–60% of patients receiving intra‐articular steroids or HA during initial (3–6 months) follow‐up 41, 42. Our own data confirmed this trend, but without reaching significance (100% vs. 62%, p = .08; Fig. 3). Taken together, our findings suggest that clinical impact of UC‐MSC treatment is beyond the expected placebo effect described for most therapeutic approaches in knee OA 43, 44.",
        "The past few years have witnessed increasing efforts in translating the benefits ascribed to cell therapy in a restricted—usually FCD—group of OA patients to the larger population with established nonfocal degenerative disease. Autologous cell‐based therapy with bone marrow (BM‐MSCs) and adipose tissue‐derived cells (ASCs) has been the aim of most of these series. Although MSC doses and follow‐up are variable between studies, all have used a single intra‐articular injection at baseline. Orozco et al. 19 demonstrated 70% pain relief with 40 × 106 autologous BM‐MSCs at 1 and 2 years of follow‐up, and subsequently, a 40% reduction of pain and 30% improvement in joint function in a more recent open label, single‐arm study of 15 patients 45. Jo et al. assessed ASCs in a proof of concept study at three different intra‐articular cell doses (10, 50, and 100 × 106), achieving a moderate decrease in WOMAC at 6 months only in the high‐dose group 20. However, in a phase I dose‐response trial by Pers et al. 21, preliminary evidence of clinical benefit at 6 months in terms of pain and disability was achieved only with the smallest cell dosing, of 2 × 106. The combination of MSC plus HA in a single injection has not added any clinical benefit so far 46.",
        "Even if all such MSC‐based trials report a good safety record, and some degree of improvement of cartilage quality or chondral defects 20, 21, 45, autologous cell therapy does encounter limitations. When derived from bone marrow, a 100‐fold decline of precursor cells has been noted from birth to the average age of typical OA patients 47. Furthermore, reduced chondrogenic activity of MSCs has been described in cultures originating from individuals with advanced OA 48. In this regard, the allogeneic source provided in the present trial (UC‐MSC) was shown to express superior clonogenicity, migration, and paracrine capacities in vitro, as well as less senescence when compared with BM‐MSCs 23. Indeed, our cell source has been extensively characterized and tested for alloreactivity 23, immunoregulatory and paracrine effects 24, and tumor development in immunodeficient laboratory animals 23, 49. This underscores that allogeneic cell sources can be batch tested for quality, purity, or potency 32, and made accessible for “off the shelf” administration, with no need for delays or prior invasive harvesting procedures. In spite of these advantages, clinical testing of allogeneic cell sources in OA has been limited. In cases with established disease, Vega et al. 22 have recently published a trial with 40 × 106 allogeneic BM‐MSCs showing 10% reduction of pain by WOMAC and mild improvement in cartilage morphology by MRI T2 mapping. Gupta et al. 50, in a study also with allogeneic BM‐MSCs, found no significant differences when comparing several intra‐articular cell doses (25, 50, 75, and 150 million) with placebo. In our protocol, we chose a dose of 20 × 106 UC‐MSCs, considered intermediate, given the large variability (3 to 150 × 106 cells) reported in trials. Another advantage of our trial was to test repeated MSC injections, totaling 40 × 106 cells and allowing the comparison of single versus double MSC doses, with respect to HA administration, because the available preclinical data suggested periodic application of MSCs could inhibit OA progression in rats 51. In contrast with preclinical observations by Joswig et al. 52, in our case, repeated intra‐articular injection of UC‐MSCs in patients did not trigger more frequent or severe AEs. Although allogeneic Adipose Tissue (AT)‐MSCs have been shown to induce a humoral immune response in patients 53, our prior experience with the UC‐MSC source from this trial describes no emergence of donor reactivity in response to treatment 23.",
        "Regarding structural outcomes, we detected no change at 6‐ or 12‐month follow‐up in our patients, possibly given the mild baseline involvement upon imaging. Initial WORMS scores were low (46.1 and 40.1 out of total 332 in MSC‐1 and ‐2 groups), and indexes for the cartilage component showed only limited disease according to our inclusion criteria. Nonetheless, longer‐term—2 year—data from our series could be informative because Vangsness et al. 18 have noted a preventive effect of MSC cell‐based therapy in OA development, with increased (3.1×) odds of disease progression at 2‐year follow‐up in controls. The main limitations of this phase I/II, randomized, controlled, triple‐blind trial are related to the small number of patients per group and the mild‐to‐moderate OA, which was associated with a low clinical and radiological involvement.",
        "In this phase I/II trial, a repeated UC‐MSC dose strategy led to a favorable safety profile and improved clinical result for the treatment of long‐term pain in knee OA patients.",

        "The synovial joint (SJ) facilitates the movement between adjacent bones ensuring a physiological range of motion. The joint cavity contains synovial fluid (SF), an ultrafiltrate of blood plasma that is secreted by the synovial membrane (synovium) which lines the articular capsule. The SF is primarily composed of hyaluronan, lubricin, proteinase, collagenases, and prostaglandins [1]. Hyaline cartilage forms the articular cartilage, which is continuous with the synovial membrane, covering the entire articulating surface of each bone [2]. SJs are comprised of a collection of tissue types enclosed within a sheath and, as such, is considered as being an organ. Like other organs, SJs are targets for various disorders, such as autoimmune diseases, infections, trauma, and, most commonly, degenerative changes such as those found in osteoarthritis (OA) [3]. Inflammatory joint diseases affect the entire synovial joint, with pathological changes observed in joint components, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, synovial fibroblasts, synovial macrophages, adipocytes, tenocytes, ligament fibroblasts and endothelial cells [4], as well as the modified inflammatory milieu of immune cells [5]. SJ disorders, such as OA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), afflict a substantial proportion of the global population, reportedly reaching 7% [6] and 1% [7] worldwide, respectively.",
        "Arthritis is broadly classified into inflammatory and non-inflammatory types, both including a plethora of etiologies [8]. Inflammatory arthritis is comprised of RA, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) [9]. Additional arthritic conditions include mono-arthritis [10], and oligo-arthritis or polyarthritis, depending upon the number of affected joints. Gout and Pseudogout are inflammatory metabolic arthropathies caused by crystal deposits [11]. OA is the most prevalent form of arthritis and a leading cause of chronic pain and long-term disability in the elderly. The health and economic burden of OA is increasing in parallel with the ageing of the global population [12].",
        "Inflammatory arthritis management has substantially improved patients’ quality of life and clinical outcomes [13]. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends starting treatment for newly diagnosed RA patients by means of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) therapy, mostly focusing upon methotrexate (MTX) [14], either alone or in combination with other csDMARDs or glucocorticoids (GCs). If the therapy is not well tolerated or ineffective, EULAR recommends using one of the following biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs): inhibitors of TNF, IL-6 receptor or CD20 antibody, a selective T cell co-stimulation modulator, CTLA-4 Ig, or targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs (Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors) [15]. For PsA patients, EULAR recommends treatment with csDMARDs (MTX) as an initial therapy. bDMARDs that include TNF, IL-17, IL-12/23, IL-23 inhibitors, or targeted therapies, such as phosphodiesterase-4, and JAK inhibitors are indicated if the treatment target had not been achieved [16]. GCs administrated through intra-articular (IA) injections are gold standard treatment for persistent joint inflammation [17].",
        "There are no systemic approved disease-modifying drugs (DMOADs) for OA patients [18]. The most common therapeutic options to treat OA patients' joints are GCs administrated intra-articularly [19]. Joint replacement surgery is considered for severe cases of uncontrollable clinical disease with inadequate response to conservative treatment [13]. There are a few experimental alternative intra-articular (IA) treatment options, such as hyaluronic acid (HA) injections, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and novel cell-based therapeutics [20]. Clinical outcomes with those novel experimental approaches, however, are often inconsistent, with different strengths recommended across guidelines [21].",
        "MSCs are stromal cells that have self-renew abilities and exhibit multi-lineage differentiation. MSCs can be isolated from a variety of tissues, such as the umbilical cord, endometrial polyps, menses blood, bone marrow (BM), or adipose tissue [22]. MSCs derived from multiple sources have been used as cell-based therapy for decades due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties [23, 24]. Studies on MSCs for OA therapy have shown positive clinical outcomes, with improved joint function, pain level, and quality of life. Several clinical MSCs trials conducted on RA patients have also demonstrated some advantages [25, 26]. The largely positive outcomes without severe side effects in clinical trials have established MSCs as promising tools for arthritis therapy. However, further research is required to investigate its applicability in clinical settings [26]. This review will cover current in-vitro and in-vivo models in MSCs research for synovial joint disorder therapy, the results of clinical trials that investigated IA administration of MSCs, and the recent advancements in the potential application of cell-free therapy by means of MSCs-derived extracellular vesicles.",
        "AD-MSCs have gained interest due to their therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine. Their low immunogenicity and their ability to self-renew, to differentiate into various tissue-specific progenitors, to migrate into damaged sites, and to act through autocrine and paracrine pathways have all been shown to be the main mechanisms by which cell repair and regeneration occur [27]. Unlike bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), AD-MSCs can be extracted in large, concentrated quantities (about 500 times more than BM-MSCs) by means of relatively simple procedures and under local anesthesia. Another benefit of AD-MSCs is that they can be extracted from various human body sites [26]. Furthermore, it has been shown that adipose tissue is superior to BM because of its safety and consistent efficacy in improving pain and functional outcomes [28].",
        "Most studies examining the effect of AD-MSCs on joint disorders rely upon in-vitro models in which synovial cells cultured with AD-MSCs are tested, providing information on their reciprocal effect as summarized in Table 1. These models enable the investigation of gene expression, proliferation, secreted proteins, cell populations, and cellular morphology. The different strategies to co-culture AD-MSCs with synovial cells are shown in Fig. 1. AD-MSCs are isolated from adipose tissue, while synovial cells are extracted from SF obtained via arthrocentesis from patients with synovitis (Fig. 1A). Direct and indirect co-cultures allow the investigation of different types of cellular communication, like juxtacrine (Fig. 1B) and paracrine (Fig. 1C) signaling, through the degree of exposure different cell types have on each other. In Fig. 1B and C shown are synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMCs) a cell fraction grown in suspension. Figure 1D shows examination of AD-MSCs conditioned medium (CM) on two synovial cell types: SFMCs (in suspension) and adherent fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS).Table 1Summary of in vitro findings of AD-MSCs in co-culture systemsCulture systemCell sourceEffectRefDirect co-culturePeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and AD-MSCs, previously primed with or without IL-1βAD-MSCs modified CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio[29]AD-MSCs and activated-M1-like macrophages differentiated from PBMCs and digested OA synoviumAD-MSCs responsible for the switching of activated-M1-like inflammatory macrophages to a M2-like phenotype[30]RA patients SF-primed AD-MSCs, CD4+ T cells and monocytes obtained from peripheral blood samplesThe effect of SF on the ability of AD-MSCs to modulate the phenotype of macrophages or T cells was evaluated[31]MSCs line with chondrocytes isolated from OA patients3D co-culture induced suitable conditions for MSC differentiation toward chondrocytes better than 2D standard culture[32]Indirect–transwell co-cultureAD-MSCs in the upper chamber and peripheral blood monocytes (CD14+) in wellThe ability of AD-MSCs to modulate the macrophage phenotype was enhanced after priming with IL-1β[29]AD-MSCs in the upper chamber and activated-M1-like, M2-like macrophages and SF cells in the lower chamberMigration assays were performed to determine if M1-like, M2-like macrophages, and SF cells influenced the migration of AD-MSCs.

        "Giannasi et al. compared the secretome composition of CM collected after 24 h or 72 h from untreated MSCs and from cytokine-primed MSCs with either tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and/or interleukin 1β (IL-1β). The pre-activation of AD-MSCs aimed to mimic the pathological milieu of OA joints in order to target their secretion towards a specific pathological phenotype. Their results indicated that pre-conditioning AD-MSCs with inflammatory cytokines induced cell activation and led to the enrichment of their secretome by several factors with recognized anti-OA effect, including anti-inflammatory, chondroprotective, and analgesic properties [38]. These findings have also been confirmed by Colombini et al.’s group, who demonstrated an enhanced immunomodulatory potential of IL-1β-primed AD-MSCs on macrophages [29]. Another study examined the role of AD-MSCs in switching activated M1-like inflammatory macrophages into M2-like anti-inflammatory phenotype, partially through the PGE2/COX2 pathway, as the authors demonstrated with isolated OA synovial macrophages. This capability supports a specific role of AD-MSCs in the therapeutic resolution of OA synovial inflammation, as well as providing evidence that IFNγ-activated M1-like macrophages represent a good cell model capable of testing AD-MSCs activity [30].",
        "Migration plays an important role in the therapeutic function of stem cells. AD-MSCs can migrate toward tissue injury sites in response to high levels of chemokines [39]. In order to assess such AD-MSCs activity, transwell inserts with large (8 μm) porous were used, allowing cells in the upper chamber to migrate through the pores. The degree of migration of different cells can then be quantified [e.g. chondrocytes [33], B [40] and T cells [41]] with or without AD-MSCs.",
        "Zhang et al. showed that AD-MSCs significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of primary articular chondrocytes when co-cultured together, suggesting that AD-MSCs may act upon endogenous chondrocytes by secreting trophic factors. Co-cultured AD-MSCs also significantly upregulated the expression of articular chondrocyte re-differentiation markers and downregulated the expression of articular chondrocyte de-differentiation markers at the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that AD-MSCs were capable of forming high-quality biomechanical articular cartilage in-vivo [33].",
        "It is important to take into account the effects of synovial cells on AD-MSCs when considering AD-MSCs as a possible therapy for inflammatory synovial disorders. Sayegh et al. demonstrated that the immunomodulatory efficiency of AD-MSCs is highly dependent upon the cytokine/articular microenvironment. AD-MSCs cultured with pro-inflammatory SF of RA patients maintained their proliferation capability and upregulated gene expression involved in immunomodulation through a TNF/NF-κB-dependent mechanism. Their results also showed that AD-MSCs exposed to pro-inflammatory SF were more effective in inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inhibiting pro-inflammatory macrophages compared to control SF obtained from a patient undergoing a trauma-related surgery [31]. Another group co-cultured SF from OA patients with AD-MSCs with the aim of mimicking the joint cavity environment. Their results showed an increase in AD-MSCs viability following SF supplementation as well as changes in several genes involved in cell survival. For example, FOS like 1 (FOSL1), which is involved in the therapeutic effect of AD-MSCs, was upregulated after SF exposure. Those authors suggested that future AD-MSC-based therapy may be further enhanced in an environment that facilitates upregulation of the expression of FOSL1, an AP-1 transcription factor subunit, expression [42]. Wesdorp et al. [43] studied the influence of synovial inflammation on MSCs migration, and whether modulation of inflammation with GCs (triamcinolone acetonide [TAA]) may influence migration. Those authors found that macrophages secrete factors that stimulate MSCs migration, and that modulation with TAA specifically increased the ability of anti-inflammatory macrophages to stimulate MSCs migration. They suggested that modulating inflammation and thereby improving MSCs migration could be a therapeutic approach based upon endogenous repair of cartilage defects.",
        "It has been suggested that the 3-dimensional (3D) spheroid, which is a multicellular aggregate formed under non-adherent 3D in-vitro conditions, may be a useful in-vitro method to better understand MSCs therapy since expression of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and other adhesion proteins as well as immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic genes are upregulated in that cell culture system [44]. AD-MSCs spheroids could therefore emerge as a promising OA treatment, although studying the appropriate methods of administration and considering their interaction with SF is essential. Toward this end, Fuku et al. [45] examined the effect of patient SF on 2D-culture AD-MSCs and spheroid AD-MSCs and observed that SF exhibited a lethal effect on AD-MSCs in 4 patients. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of such an effect of SF on AD-MSCs. Although many positive effects have been attributed to the formation of AD-MSC spheroids, Fuku’s group emphasized that the usefulness of spheroids in OA treatment should be examined in experimental conditions that are more suitable for the joint cavity environment and in a larger number of cases. They recommended that the cytotoxic activity of SF against AD-MSCs administered for therapeutic purposes into the joint cavity should be considered when improving culture methods [45].",
        "It has been shown that AD-MSCs secretum, also known as CM, possesses effects like those observed after transplantation of MSCs [46], containing many cytokines, proteins, growth factors, as well as extra cellular vehicles (EVs) with beneficial effects that can be used in regenerative medicine [47]. For example, one group treated synovium and cartilage explants with MSCs-CM to study the paracrine effect of MSCs secretome. Additionally, they used a co-culture system of synovium and cartilage explants, while preventing direct contact between cartilage and synovium, using filter inserts, creating a more complex and clinically relevant model to test AD-MSCs secretome. Using this culture setting, they found that synovial explants exposed to MSCs-CM expressed less pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL-1β, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and had reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, while upregulating multiple anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic pathways in osteoarthritic cartilage and synovium [36].",
        "EVs comprise a heterogeneous group of vesicles released by various cell types, EVs are released from cells but cannot replicate on their own. EVs can be classified into different subtypes based on their diameter: exosomes (30–100 nm), microvesicles (100–1,000 nm), and apoptotic vesicles (1–5 mm) [48] (Fig. 2A). Several studies have indicated that EVs can transfer their contents to elicit functional responses and mediate signaling through surface receptor contact between cells. EVs contain thousands of different bioactive molecules, including surface proteins, intercellular proteins, amino acids, metabolites, mRNAs, non-coding RNA species, and DNA [49] (Fig. 2B), playing an active role in various processes, such as angiogenesis, antigen presentation, cellular homoeostasis, inflammation, and immunomodulation. EVs derived from various types of MSCs have recently been explored as a novel strategy for cell-free therapy in a variety of diseases, including RA. Based upon current evidence, EV-derived MSCs have been demonstrated to be important MSCs mediators that exert similar functions, and that they can perform the indispensable functions of their parental cells. AD-MSC-derived EVs (AD-MSC-EVs) are thought to function similarly to AD-MSCs.Fig. 2AD-MSCs-derived extra-cellular vesicles (EVs) A Types of EVs; exosomes (30–100 nm), microvesicles (100–1,000 nm), and apoptotic vesicles (1–5 mm) and their mode of secretion into the extracellular space.

        "Although several studies have shown that AD-MSCs could ameliorate RA, the ones that explored the role of AD-MSC-EVs for RA treatment have emerged only recently [49].",
        "Farinazzo et al. showed that AD-MSC-EVs can partially inhibit T cells activation in-vitro, but that this effect was insufficient in-vivo. In addition, AD-MSC-EVs were shown to drive M2 macrophage polarization, thus reducing the ability of macrophages to evoke inflammatory responses. Interestingly, Rossana et al. [50] demonstrated that only the EVs that had been isolated from AD-MSCs pre-activated with IFN-γ and TNF-α induced M2 macrophage polarization. Those authors therefore suggested that the effects of the immunomodulatory AD-MSCs-EVs on macrophages may not be constitutive but rather induced by the inflammatory microenvironment.",
        "The therapeutic ability of MSCs to address OA mainly relates to the secretion of bioactive factors, which can be found within their secreted EVs. Cavallo et al. [51] demonstrated the potential of AD-MSC-derived small EVs (sEVs) by showing their effect on gene expression and protein release of both chondrocytes and synoviocytes by counteracting IL-1β-induced inflammatory effects. The inflammatory environment mediated by NF-κB pathway was significantly attenuated by sEVs. This approach can potentially be used as a new therapeutic strategy for OA therapy. Another group showed that EVs reduced the production of inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, PGE2, and NO in OA chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1β. Treatment also decreased the release of MMP activity and MMP-13 expression, whereas the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the expression of collagen II were significantly enhanced [52].",
        "In a similar model, Tofiño-Vian et al. showed that EVs from AD-MSCs reduced inflammation and oxidative stress, mostly through IL-6 and prostaglandin E2, which may mediate anti-senescence effects in OA osteoblasts, seen by the downregulation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and the reduced accumulation of γH2AX foci [53].",
        "Among the bio-active molecules in AD-MSC-EVs microRNAs (miRNAs), e.g. miR-146a [54], miR-451a [55], miR-93-5p [56], miR-376c-3p [57], have been shown to directly alleviate local inflammation and promote tissue repair. Engineering AD-MSCs, whether by pre-activation or direct transfection, is used as a novel approach for functionalizing AD-MSC-EVs for a more potent immunomodulatory and regenerative effect. Li et al. showed that miR-338-3p overexpressing AD-MSCs exosomes could inhibit chondrocyte inflammation and degradation, as seen by decreased expression of PGE2, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, MMP-3 and MMP-13, as well as by promoting chondrocyte proliferation through targeting RUNX2 [58]. Martinez-Zalbidea et al. transduced an immortalized AD-MSCs line with a CRISPR activation lentivirus system that overexpressed the TSG-6 gene and demonstrated their immunomodulatory potential in IL-1β activated intervertebral disc cells, specifically downregulating IL-8 and COX-2 [59].",
        "Adipose tissue-derived autologous cells are easier to obtain for cell-free therapy in large-scale populations, making adipose tissue a richer and safer source compared to other tissues. Proteomic analyses have shown that AD-MSC-EVs are more closely associated with immunomodulation-related proteins than those from BM-MSC-EVs [60]. In addition, AD-MSC-EVs have been shown to be more effective than BM-MSC-EVs at promoting cartilage and bone regeneration in a mouse model and they represented a superior resource for cell-free therapy [61]. Woo et al. demonstrated that AD-MSC-EVs not only promoted the proliferation and migration of human OA chondrocytes, but that they also maintained the chondrocyte matrix by increasing type II collagen synthesis and decreasing MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5 expression [62].",
        "In-vivo models are necessary for translation of novel treatments to human trials. Understanding the effects of AD-MSCs on synovial cells requires the selection of animal models of various arthritic conditions. Here, we discuss experimental models used to investigate the effects of AD-MSCs on inflammatory arthritis, OA, and metabolic arthritis.",
        "In-vivo experimental animal models of inflammatory RA are used extensively to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms governing inflammation-driven joint damage. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is the RA animal model most commonly used in basic research and drug development studies since it resembles the human RA features of typical synovitis and bone erosion manifestations. BM-MSCs were shown to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro but could not inhibit CIA disease severity [63]. In contrast, MSC-derived EVs ameliorated CIA manifestations via induction of immunomodulatory T lymphocytes [64]. Methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) is another model, and it includes local immunization with a protein antigen (BSA, ovalbumin) followed by IA administration to the affected joints. In contrast to other RA models, AIA occurs only in the injected joints and the immune response is confined to the affected joint where histological features are similar to those of RA [65]. IA administration of MSCs in that model showed reduced inflammation and cartilage damage [66], and MSCs-CM reduced disease severity and immune responses [67].",
        "Proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA) is induced by repeated immunizations with cartilage PG aggrecan in adjuvant, resulting in polyarthritis and subsequent articular cartilage and bone erosion [65]. Swart et al. [68] explored the immunosuppressive effect and mechanism of action of MSCs administrated via intraperitoneal (IP) and IA administration in a PGIA model. MSCs treatment, both via IP and IA, suppressed PGIA. MSCs were largely retained for weeks in the injection site. Those authors showed that MSCs treatment induced a more regulatory phenotype with the production of IL-4 and IL-10, but also of IFN-γ, and a systemic decrease of pathogenic antibodies, thus demonstrating the potential value of MSCs treatment in resistant arthritis.",
        "The K/BxN model and G6PI-induced arthritis are transgenic mice expressing a transgenic T-cell receptor (TcR). These mice develop spontaneous arthritis, which was shown to be B-cell dependent. The transfer of IgG antibodies from arthritic K/BxN mice to naïve mice induced transient arthritis in many different mouse strains. It has been shown that AD-MSCs therapy was unsuitable for modulating the progression of K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis. Based upon the differences in the immune status and monocytic/macrophage balance among the different arthritic models, it was suggested that the identification of cell-specific targets of MSCs will assist in predicting which RA patients will respond positively to MSCs-based therapy [69]. Wang et al. showed that IA administration of AD-MSCs attenuates RA progression by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and mitigating neutrophil infiltration and cartilage erosion, as well as promotes the reconstruction of the CX3CR1+ synovial macrophage barrier in serum-transfer arthritis model mice [70].",
        "The SKG arthritis model was developed using a point mutation in the gene coding for ZAP-70, affecting TcR signaling and eventually leading to an effect upon thymic selection of T cells and, subsequently, autoimmunity. Local transplantation of AD-MSCs and AD-MSC spheroids had a significant therapeutic effect in that model [71]. Another group showed that the administration of AD-MSCs in the SKG arthritis model has a paradoxical effect according to the disease phase during which they were administered, suggesting that the cells act differently depending upon the disease stage [71].",
        "Transgenic mice that overexpress human IL-1α are used to study the role of IL-1 in arthritis. These mice develop spontaneous polyarthritis, synovial proliferation, and cartilage and bone destruction. The cellular composition in joints changed in favor of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and macrophages [72]. Lee et al. [73] investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of BM-MSCs in an IL-1RaKO mouse model. Those authors demonstrated that BM-MSCs inhibited Th17 polarization and thereby reduced inflammation in those mice.",
        "Current animal models for OA can be broadly classified into subtypes, as described by Samvelyan et al. [74], including naturally occurring, genetically modified, surgically induced, chemically induced, and non-invasive models. Spontaneous OA models, such as naturally occurring and genetically modified ones, are commonly used to study primary OA, while invasive models, such as surgically and chemically induced ones, as well as non-invasive models are used to investigate secondary OA. Invasive models are largely used to assess the efficacy of potential OA treatments. Li et al. [75] injected AD-MSCs to rats in an OA model induced by medial meniscectomy of the knee for 8 weeks prior to AD-MSCs injection. AD-MSCs transplantation was accompanied by enhanced cartilage regeneration in those rats. Their study also demonstrated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of labeled AD-MSCs in the injured rat joints 10 weeks after their IA administration. The authors concluded that AD-MSCs persisted locally for 10 weeks in the rat joint, coinciding with the efficacy observed. It is postulated that persistence and/or proliferation of the AD-MSCs in the joint is required to exert their functions in promoting joint regeneration and/or cartilage protection, further supporting the safety and feasibility of IA administration of AD-MSCs for OA treatment [75].",
        "Zhou et al. treated OA rats with IA administration of AD-MSCs, which alleviated OA and inhibited cartilage degeneration by suppressing cartilage apoptotic damage and reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion [76]. In contrast, repeated IA administration of allogeneic BM-MSCs resulted in an adverse clinical response and aggravation of the OA. Although there were no differences in clinical parameters between autologous and allogeneic MSC-treated equines with OA after the first IA administration of these cells, there was an adaptive immune response and aggravation of OA following a second exposure [77].",
        "Mei et al. [78] evaluated the efficacy of IA administrations of culture-expanded allogenic AD-MSCs for the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT)-induced rat OA. Their results supported the protective effect of AD-MSCs on cartilage degeneration, without any notable adverse effects. MHC-unmatched AD-MSCs protected chondrocytes from inflammatory factor-induced damage. Those results revealed that the paracrine effect of AD-MSCs on chondrocytes contributes, at least in part, to the therapeutic effect of AD-MSCs in OA. Similarly, Kuroda et al. [34] found that IA administrated AD-MSCs inhibited cartilage degeneration progression in an ACLT-OA rabbit model. That effect was mediated by AD-MSCs homing to the synovium and by the secretion of factors with chondroprotective effects, such as regulating chondrocyte viability and cartilage matrix protection, specifically thorough inhibiting MMP-13. Cheng et al. used combined IA AD-MSCs and shockwave (SW) therapy in an ACLT OA rat model. The combination therapy had a chondroprotective effect as evidenced by a significantly increased bone volume, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number, as well as a significantly reduced synovitis score compared to the other treatments [79].",
        "The use of uncultured adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) consisting of AD-MSCs as well as M2 macrophages has shown therapeutic potential for OA. Onoi et al. induced OA in immunodeficient rats by destabilization of the medial meniscus and immediately injecting human SVF, AD-MSCs, or saline (control group) into the knees. The SVF group showed significantly slower OA progression and less synovitis, with higher expression of collagen II and SOX9, lower expression of MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5, and a lower M1/M2 ratio in the synovium compared with the AD-MSCs and control groups [80]. Ko et al. [81] used another therapeutic approach consisting of 3D-cultured AD-MSCs. Those authors evaluated the effect of spheroidal AD-MSCs administration on cell survival and arrest the progression of surgically induced OA in a rat model. Their results showed that AD-MSCs spheroids had better in-vitro and in-vivo survival and better chondrogenic potential, and that they exerted greater regenerative effects than AD-MSCs in single-cell suspension, probably by a paracrine mode of action. These findings support the use of stem cell-based therapeutics upon AD-MSCs spheroid forms to treat OA. Similarly, Yoon et al. [82] compared the chondrogenic differentiation capabilities of AD-MSCs in monolayer and culture in 3D suspension bioreactors. Enhanced in vivo cartilage formation was achieved by the transplantation of spheroid-cultured AD-MSCs compared to monolayer-cultured AD-MSCs. The authors attributed this to increased TGF-β3 expression and p38 activation. Their results showed that spheroid culture may be an effective method for large-scale in-vitro chondrogenic differentiation of AD-MSCs and subsequent in-vivo cartilage formation.",
        "Pain is a recurrent symptom in OA and the primary reason for medical intervention. Amodeo et al. [83] explored the efficacy of AD-MSC-CM in controlling pain and neuroinflammation in OA. Their monosodium-iodoacetate (MIA)-induced OA mouse model is largely used to evaluate pain resulting in functional impairment similar to human OA. Those authors demonstrated that AD-MSC-CM exerts a rapid and lasting relief of pain symptoms, probably through modulation of neuroinflammation. They also reported that systemic injection of AD-MSC-CM appears to be the most active route.",
        "Several animal models of hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis have been reported for in-vivo assessment. The injection of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals into various anatomical structures to induce crystal-induced inflammation has been proposed; however, only a few of these models accurately reflect the joint microenvironment in which an acute gouty attack occurs [84]. The pathogenesis of gouty arthritis, characterized by the MSU crystal deposition in the joints associated with acute flares, has been associated with NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and subsequent amplification of the inflammatory response. Medina et al.’s study tested the effect of AD-MSCs administration on the clinical inflammatory response in rabbits after MSU injection. A single dose of AD-MSCs was injected IA shortly after IA administration of MSU crystal. There was both local and systemic inflammatory response resolution in this model. Furthermore, AD-MSCs promoted M2 macrophages in the synovial membrane, inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome, and induced anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 or TGF-β, while decreasing NF-κB activity [85]. The few in-vivo models that have thus far been described in the literature for PsA include three main categories of animal models for PsA: spontaneous/gene mutant types, transgenic types, and induced types [86]. MSCs were not employed for treatment of PsA in those models.",
        "In animal models, Woo et al. showed that IA administration of AD-MSC-EVs significantly attenuated OA progression and protected cartilage from degeneration in two OA models [62]. In addition, MSCs exosomes were shown to reduce pain and repair temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (OA-TMJ) by mounting a well-coordinated response of attenuating inflammation, enhancing proliferation and matrix synthesis, while reducing apoptosis and matrix degradation to achieve overall joint homeostasis and promote TMJ repair and regeneration in an OA-TMJ animal model [87]. Tsujimaru et al. showed that AD-MSC-EVs possess immunosuppressive factors in their vesicles similar to AD-MSCs. They also showed that AD-MSCs and their derived EVs carry IL-1ra that effectively replaces its deficiency in an RA mice model, thereby improving their severe state. This effect has been shown to be comparable to that of anakinra, a recombinant IL-1ra-approved drug for RA management [88]. Wang et al. demonstrated the efficacy of exosomes derived from miR-486-5p overexpressing AD-MSCs in medial menisco-tibial ligament OA rat model. IA administration of miR-486-5p containing exosomes showed a better effect on cartilage preservation (decreased apoptosis, increased Col II and decreased Col X deposition), as well as synovial macrophage preservation (decreasing iNOS and increasing CD163 staining in synovium samples) [89].",
        "Clinical trials for evaluating the effectiveness of AD-MSCs for arthritis therapy in OA have shown promising results. Kim et al. conducted a clinical trial on 49 OA patients (55 knees) with symptoms of knee joint pain and/or functional limitations despite non-surgical treatments for a minimum of 3 months, AD-MSCs were harvested and loaded into a fibrin glue product and then surgically implanted into the lesion site. Clinical assessment scores showed significant improvement among the patients, with 74.5% of them expressing satisfaction with the resultant pain relief [90]. Interestingly, patients over 60 years of age who had lesion sizes > 6.0 cm2 showed less favorable results. Although there were some variations in the results due to these 2 factors, the overall clinical outcomes of MSC implantation in OA patients were encouraging.",
        "Pers et al. [91] reported their phase I, prospective, bicentric, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalating clinical trial of AD-MSCs therapy in 18 OA patients who were injected IA. Despite the limited number of patients and the absence of a placebo arm, the authors were able to demonstrate the safety and promising treatment potential of AD-MSCs. Freitag et al. [92] conducted a randomized trial on 30 OA patients in whom AD-MSCs were extracted from their adipose tissues and cultured until passage 2 prior to injection. Autologous AD-MSCs were then IA administered in a single injection (group 1) or in 2 injections (group 2), while the control patients received conservative management (group 3). The AD-MSCs-treated groups showed clinically significant improvement in pain reduction and function. Magnetic resonance imaging analyses showed that 37% of the participants in the first treatment group exhibited further cartilage loss compared to the control. However, ~ 89% of the patients in the second treatment group showed marked improvement or no progression in cartilage loss. Furthermore, no serious adverse events were observed in the 2 treated groups during follow-up. The authors concluded that AD-MSCs therapy is a safe and effective treatment for OA and that frequent injections are preferable.",
        "Lee et al. conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 24 patients with knee OA aged 18–75 years who had a mean pain intensity (VAS score) of 4 or higher for a minimum of 12 weeks with at least 1 grade 3–4 lesion. The patients were randomly divided into those treated with IA AD-MSCs administration and a control group administrated with saline. The AD-MSC-treated group showed significant reductions in knee pain. Their physical and radiological examination data showed that they demonstrated a wider range of knee motion and unchanged cartilage defects, in contrast to the enlargement of defects seen in the control group. It was concluded that IA administrations of autologous AD-MSCs provided satisfactory functional improvement and pain relief for OA patients, and did so without causing short-term adverse events [26, 93]. In another study evaluating the safety and therapeutic potential of autologous AD-MSCs in OA patients, 18 OA patients were enrolled and divided into three dose groups. Clinical and radiological parameters were evaluated during 96 weeks of follow-up. The high-dose AD-MSCs group exhibited better pain relief and greater improvement in knee function compared to the other 2 groups [94].",
        "Several studies have indicated that the inhibitory effect of AD-MSCs is affected by the stage of OA at which they are administered, favoring early-stage intervention with little to no effect in the late stage of the disease [95–97]. In addition, swelling of the injected joints is frequently observed and is thought to be associated with the survival rate of the AD-MSCs. Directly injected cells usually have limited cell retention and survival rates, especially in large cartilage lesions. Koh et al. reported that AD-MSCs seeded in scaffolds may have better viability, preservation, and aggregation. Those authors recommended that appropriate cell-loaded scaffolds should be developed for treating patients with large cartilage defects in order to improve the efficacy of this procedure, as well as the level of comfort of the patients [97].",
        "Compared to OA, relatively few trials have been performed with MSCs in RA. In some cases, MSCs therapy may not be suitable for RA, given the growing armamentarium of other efficient therapeutics available as opposed to OA. Although there have been a limited number of clinical trials of MSCs, especially AD-MSCs for RA therapy, the therapeutic safety and efficacy have been confirmed in several studies [26]. Vij et al. conducted a phase I/IIa non-randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single, intravenous infusion of autologous AD-MSCs over a period of 52 weeks in RA patients. The results indicated that it was safe and efficacious for the improvement of joint function in those patients [98]. In a multicenter, dose escalation, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled phase Ib/IIa clinical trial of 53 patients, Álvaro-Gracia et al. demonstrated that intravenous infusion of culture-expanded AD-MSCs was generally well tolerated and free of side effects at the dose range and time frame studied [99]. In their double-blind, ascending dose, Phase I/IIa randomized controlled trial, Freitag et al. sought to assess the safety and efficacy of an allogeneic AD-MSCs preparation (MAG200) in the treatment of knee OA over 12 months. Their results showed a reproducible and statistically significant effect over placebo, which was clinically relevant for pain in the 10 ​ × ​106 dose cohort and for function in the 20 ​ × ​106 and 100 ​ × ​106 dose cohorts. Furthermore, a trend in disease-modification was observed, with improvement in total knee cartilage volume in MAG200 10, 20, and 100 ​ × ​106 dose cohorts, but with progression of the OA in placebo group, though this was not statistically significant [100].",
        "Chen et al. evaluated the safety and efficacy of IA administration of allogeneic AD-MSCs (ELIXCYTE®) for OA knee among 57 subjects in a patient-blind, randomized, active-control trial consisting of 4 arms that consisted of a hyaluronic acid control and 3 ELIXCYTE® doses. The results showed a significantly reduced pain score at week 24 between the post-treatment visit and baseline in all ELIXCYTE® groups. Compared to HA group, those groups revealed significant decreases at week 4 in total pain scores, stiffness scores, and functional limitation scores, suggesting the potential benefit of ELIXCYTE® in earlier onset cases [101]. Similarly, Kuah et al. investigated Progenza (PRG) in-vitro expanded AD-MSCs with cell culture supernatant as potential disease-modifying treatment options for OA. Their single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study showed significant within-group improvement in pain scores from baseline at all-time points for the PRG group, with highly significant improvements seen at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 compared to the marginal improvement in the placebo group [102]. Although its safety has been extensively demonstrated, it is important to note that allogenic AD-MSCs IA administrations might have serious consequences in certain conditions. For example, Hosono et al. reported the development of severe arthritis caused by multiple IA administration with AD-MSCs for knee OA. A total of 113 patients received AD-MSCs treatment, and 75% (85/113) of them received an AD-MSCs injection at least twice with a 6-month interval. Although no obvious negative sequelae were observed in any patient after the first treatment, 53% (45/85) of the patients who received their second or third AD-MSCs injections sustained severe knee arthritis. In terms of pathophysiology, Hosono et al. found anti-histone H2B Ab in SF samples from patients who exhibited severe arthritis following the second AD-MSCs treatment [103]. Although more research is needed to determine the duration of the therapeutic effects, the optimal dosing, and the administration strategy, as well as recipient patient profiles for treatment candidates, AD-MSCs are considered to be low-risk and suitable for treatment. The source of AD-MSCs, whether autologous (derived from the patient) [90–95, 98] or allogenic (donor-derived) [99–104], as well as additional donor characteristics (Fig. 3A), should also be addressed in future research and therapeutic decisions.Fig. 3Standardization of AD-MSCs and AD-MSC-derived therapies may promote the translation into clinical practice A Identification of suitable donor candidates for AD-MSCs source isolation, being syngeneic or allogeneic transplantation, maximizing treatment potency. B Production and processing of a variety of AD-MSCs and AD-MSC-derived therapies insuring both quality and safety. C Stem cell-based therapy can be translated to clinical practice and potentially become an off-the-shelf treatment for the wide population",

        "Finally, MSCs and their derived products have immunomodulatory, chondro- and osteo-protective potential via functional changes of T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and synovial cells that help restore the synovial hemostasis, as shown in the graphical abstract. Many pathways relating to the pathogenesis of arthritis have been shown to be affected by AD-MSCs. Table 2. summarizes the underlying mechanisms of AD-MSC-mediated immunomodulation and tissue regenerative abilities across experimental models. AD-MSCs treatment has consistently been shown to reduce the levels of IL-1β and TNFα, key cytokines involved in the inflammatory response and the development of structural bone and cartilage damage in arthritis. In contrast, IL-10 and TGF-β, key regulators of immune homeostasis, are consistently increased by AD-MSCs treatment. These findings coincide with phenotypic changes from inflammatory T-cells to Tregs and from M1-macrophages to M2-macrophages.Table 2Summary of the effects of AD-MSC effects on disease-associated inflammatory cells/cytokines across arthritis modelsAD-MSCs treatment typeModelResultsReferenceT-cellsIn-vitroAD-MSCs CMRA human PBMCs↑ TGF-β, ↑ Tregs, ↓ Th17, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-17, ↓ IL-21[105]Allogeneic AD-MSCsCollagen-reactive RA human T cells; direct and transwell co-cultures↓ IFNγ, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-17, ↑ IL-10, ↑ Tregs[106]SF primed AD-MSCsActivated CD4+ T cells; direct co-culture↑ Tregs, ↓ Th1[31]AD-MSCsCD3+ T cells from CIA mouse lymph node↓ IFNγ, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-2, ↑ IL-10, ↑ TGF-β[107]AD-MSCsCon A-stimulated murine splenocytes and human PBMCs; direct co-culture↓ T-cell proliferation[108]In-vivoHuman AD-MSCs, allogeneic and syngeneic murine AD-MSCsCIA mice; intraperitoneal injection↓ Sera IgG, ↓ RANTES, ↓ Th1/Th17, ↓ IFNγ, ↓ TNFα, ↑ IL-10, ↑ Tregs[107]AD-MSCsCIA mice; Intravenous injection↓ GM-CSF+CD4+ T cells (in spleen and peripheral blood but not in the draining lymph nodes), ↑ Tregs, Tr1, and LAG-3+Tr1 cells (in the draining lymph nodes)[109]AD-MSCsSKG mice; intraperitoneal injectionCon-A stimulated splenocytes; ↓ IL-17, ↓ IL-6, ↑ IL-10, ↑ TGF-β[108]Clinical trialAD-MSCsPhase Ib/IIa clinical trialDistribution of T-cell populations, including Tregs in circulation, was not significantly modified among cohorts[99]Monocytes/MacrophagesIn vitroIL-1β primed Allogeneic AD-MSCsCollagen-reactive RA human monocytes/macrophages; direct and transwell co-cultures↑ IL-10[106]IL-1β primed AD-MSCsLPS\\IFN-γ activated CD14+ monocytes from healthy donors; transwell co-culture↑ CD206, ↑ M2-macrophages[29]AD-MSCsIFN-γ activated CD14+ monocytes from healthy donors; transwell co-culture↓ M1-macrophages (↓ IL-1β, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ MIP1α/CCL3, ↓ S100A8, ↓ S100A9), ↑ M2-macrophages (↑ IL-10, ↑ CD163, ↑ CD206, ↑ PGE2[30]SF primed AD-MSCsLPS\\IFN-γ activated CD14 + monocytes; direct co-culture↓ CD40, ↓ CD80[31]AD-MSCs and AD-MSC spheroidsPMA-differentiated, LPS activated THP-1 cells; co-culture↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6[71]Murine inguinal fat AD-MSCsCX3CR1+ synovial lining macrophages from healthy mice; direct and transwell co-culturesTranscriptome related to leukocyte cell–cell adhesion, migration, and regulation of immune effector were significantly enriched and upregulated, e.g. M2 polarization; ↑ Rac2, ↑ CCL2, enhanced barrier function in CX3CR1+ macrophages; ↑ Tjp1, ↑ F11r[70]In-vivoAD-MSCs and AD-MSC spheroidsSKG mice; IA administration↓ Macrophage infiltration[71]Murine inguinal fat AD-MSCsK/BxN serum-transfer arthritis mice; IA administrationSynovium; ↓ IL-1β, ↓ TNFα, ↑ CX3CR1+ macrophagesPeripheral blood; ↑ IL-10, ↓ IL-6, ↓ IL-1β[70]Synovial cellsIn vitroAllogeneic AD-MSCsLPS\\TNFα stimulated RA human FLS; direct and transwell co-cultures↓ TNFα, ↓ PGE2, ↓ collagenase activity, ↓ gelatinase activity[106]AD-MSCsCollagen-reactive CIA mice synovial cells; direct and transwell co-cultures↓ IL-1β, ↓ TNFα, ↓ MIP2, ↓ INFγ, ↓ IL-12, ↓ RANTES, ↑ IL-10, ↓ IL-17, ↓ IL-2, ↑ TGFβ[107]AD-MSCs from infrapatellar Hoffa fat, SC hip fat, and SC abdominal fatchondrocytes and synoviocytes; transwell co-cultures↓ IL-1β, ↓ IL-6, ↓ CXCL8/IL-8, ↓ COX2, ↑ PGE2[110]AD-MSC-EVs and CMIL-1β activated OA chondrocytes and cartilage explants↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ PGE2, ↓ NO, ↓ COX2, ↓ MMP activity, ↓ MMP-13, ↑ IL-10, ↑ collagen II[52]AD-MSC-EVs and CMIL-1β activated OA Osteoblasts↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ PGE2, ↑ IL-10, ↓ mitochondrial oxidative stress, ↓ accumulation of γH2AX foci[53]AD-MSC and AD-MSC spheroidsRA synovial fibroblasts; transwell co-cultures↓ Migration, ↓ proliferation[71]infrapatellar fat pad AD-MSCIL‐1β activated OA articular cartilage cells↑ COL2A1, ↑ Aggrecan, ↑ SOX9, ↓ MMP‐13, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ IL-1β, ↓ ROS[111]In-vivoinfrapatellar fat pad AD-MSCSprague–Dawley rats OA; IA administrationIn synovial fluid; ↓ ROS, ↓ IL-6, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-1β[111]Autologous AD-MSC and SVFSheep transected meniscus; IA administrationCondyle Immunohistochemistry; ↑ COLL2, ↓ COLL1, ↓ IL-1β, ↓ MMP13Synovial Fluid; ↓ IL-1β, ↓ CTX2, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ PGE2[112]AD-MSC derived exosomesMIA-induced rat OA model; IA administrationcartilage tissues and rat synovial tissues; ↓ β-catenin, ↓ WNT3, ↓ WNT9, ↑ COL2[57]",

        "AD-MSCs therapy for inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint disorders generally exhibited positive outcomes across research platforms, including in-vitro and in-vivo animal studies as well as in human clinical trials. However, despite its immense potential, only a few MSC-based therapies have been approved. It is vital for research groups to choose the appropriate models, both in-vitro and in-vivo, understand their limitations, and work to maximize their translatability. While significant progress has been made, additional research is needed to optimize AD-MSCs and AD-MSC-derived EV treatment strategies for joint disorders. Figure 3 shows the potential of future studies investigating AD-MSCs and their derivatives products towards clinical therapeutic use. The research needs to include platforms for evaluating the safety, optimal dosing, administration routes as well as profiles of patients who are candidates for such treatment (Fig. 3A). Standardizing the method of culturing, isolating and processing AD-MSC-derived treatments (Fig. 3B), could lead to their use in clinical application for standard arthritis care (Fig. 3C).",
        "Additionally, further insights into the immunomodulatory mechanisms of AD-MSCs and AD-MSC-derived EVs in synovial joint disorders are necessary for successful translation into clinical practice. Overall, while AD-MSC-based therapies show promise for the treatment of joint disorders, further research is essential to realize their full therapeutic potential.",

        "The synovial joint (SJ) facilitates the movement between adjacent bones ensuring a physiological range of motion. The joint cavity contains synovial fluid (SF), an ultrafiltrate of blood plasma that is secreted by the synovial membrane (synovium) which lines the articular capsule. The SF is primarily composed of hyaluronan, lubricin, proteinase, collagenases, and prostaglandins [1]. Hyaline cartilage forms the articular cartilage, which is continuous with the synovial membrane, covering the entire articulating surface of each bone [2]. SJs are comprised of a collection of tissue types enclosed within a sheath and, as such, is considered as being an organ. Like other organs, SJs are targets for various disorders, such as autoimmune diseases, infections, trauma, and, most commonly, degenerative changes such as those found in osteoarthritis (OA) [3]. Inflammatory joint diseases affect the entire synovial joint, with pathological changes observed in joint components, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, synovial fibroblasts, synovial macrophages, adipocytes, tenocytes, ligament fibroblasts and endothelial cells [4], as well as the modified inflammatory milieu of immune cells [5]. SJ disorders, such as OA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), afflict a substantial proportion of the global population, reportedly reaching 7% [6] and 1% [7] worldwide, respectively.",
        "Arthritis is broadly classified into inflammatory and non-inflammatory types, both including a plethora of etiologies [8]. Inflammatory arthritis is comprised of RA, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) [9]. Additional arthritic conditions include mono-arthritis [10], and oligo-arthritis or polyarthritis, depending upon the number of affected joints. Gout and Pseudogout are inflammatory metabolic arthropathies caused by crystal deposits [11]. OA is the most prevalent form of arthritis and a leading cause of chronic pain and long-term disability in the elderly. The health and economic burden of OA is increasing in parallel with the ageing of the global population [12].",
        "Inflammatory arthritis management has substantially improved patients’ quality of life and clinical outcomes [13]. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends starting treatment for newly diagnosed RA patients by means of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) therapy, mostly focusing upon methotrexate (MTX) [14], either alone or in combination with other csDMARDs or glucocorticoids (GCs). If the therapy is not well tolerated or ineffective, EULAR recommends using one of the following biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs): inhibitors of TNF, IL-6 receptor or CD20 antibody, a selective T cell co-stimulation modulator, CTLA-4 Ig, or targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs (Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors) [15]. For PsA patients, EULAR recommends treatment with csDMARDs (MTX) as an initial therapy. bDMARDs that include TNF, IL-17, IL-12/23, IL-23 inhibitors, or targeted therapies, such as phosphodiesterase-4, and JAK inhibitors are indicated if the treatment target had not been achieved [16]. GCs administrated through intra-articular (IA) injections are gold standard treatment for persistent joint inflammation [17].",
        "There are no systemic approved disease-modifying drugs (DMOADs) for OA patients [18]. The most common therapeutic options to treat OA patients' joints are GCs administrated intra-articularly [19]. Joint replacement surgery is considered for severe cases of uncontrollable clinical disease with inadequate response to conservative treatment [13]. There are a few experimental alternative intra-articular (IA) treatment options, such as hyaluronic acid (HA) injections, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and novel cell-based therapeutics [20]. Clinical outcomes with those novel experimental approaches, however, are often inconsistent, with different strengths recommended across guidelines [21].",
        "MSCs are stromal cells that have self-renew abilities and exhibit multi-lineage differentiation. MSCs can be isolated from a variety of tissues, such as the umbilical cord, endometrial polyps, menses blood, bone marrow (BM), or adipose tissue [22]. MSCs derived from multiple sources have been used as cell-based therapy for decades due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties [23, 24]. Studies on MSCs for OA therapy have shown positive clinical outcomes, with improved joint function, pain level, and quality of life. Several clinical MSCs trials conducted on RA patients have also demonstrated some advantages [25, 26]. The largely positive outcomes without severe side effects in clinical trials have established MSCs as promising tools for arthritis therapy. However, further research is required to investigate its applicability in clinical settings [26]. This review will cover current in-vitro and in-vivo models in MSCs research for synovial joint disorder therapy, the results of clinical trials that investigated IA administration of MSCs, and the recent advancements in the potential application of cell-free therapy by means of MSCs-derived extracellular vesicles.",
        "AD-MSCs have gained interest due to their therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine. Their low immunogenicity and their ability to self-renew, to differentiate into various tissue-specific progenitors, to migrate into damaged sites, and to act through autocrine and paracrine pathways have all been shown to be the main mechanisms by which cell repair and regeneration occur [27]. Unlike bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), AD-MSCs can be extracted in large, concentrated quantities (about 500 times more than BM-MSCs) by means of relatively simple procedures and under local anesthesia. Another benefit of AD-MSCs is that they can be extracted from various human body sites [26]. Furthermore, it has been shown that adipose tissue is superior to BM because of its safety and consistent efficacy in improving pain and functional outcomes [28].",
        "Most studies examining the effect of AD-MSCs on joint disorders rely upon in-vitro models in which synovial cells cultured with AD-MSCs are tested, providing information on their reciprocal effect as summarized in Table 1. These models enable the investigation of gene expression, proliferation, secreted proteins, cell populations, and cellular morphology. The different strategies to co-culture AD-MSCs with synovial cells are shown in Fig. 1. AD-MSCs are isolated from adipose tissue, while synovial cells are extracted from SF obtained via arthrocentesis from patients with synovitis (Fig. 1A). Direct and indirect co-cultures allow the investigation of different types of cellular communication, like juxtacrine (Fig. 1B) and paracrine (Fig. 1C) signaling, through the degree of exposure different cell types have on each other. In Fig. 1B and C shown are synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMCs) a cell fraction grown in suspension. Figure 1D shows examination of AD-MSCs conditioned medium (CM) on two synovial cell types: SFMCs (in suspension) and adherent fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS).Table 1Summary of in vitro findings of AD-MSCs in co-culture systemsCulture systemCell sourceEffectRefDirect co-culturePeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and AD-MSCs, previously primed with or without IL-1βAD-MSCs modified CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio[29]AD-MSCs and activated-M1-like macrophages differentiated from PBMCs and digested OA synoviumAD-MSCs responsible for the switching of activated-M1-like inflammatory macrophages to a M2-like phenotype[30]RA patients SF-primed AD-MSCs, CD4+ T cells and monocytes obtained from peripheral blood samplesThe effect of SF on the ability of AD-MSCs to modulate the phenotype of macrophages or T cells was evaluated[31]MSCs line with chondrocytes isolated from OA patients3D co-culture induced suitable conditions for MSC differentiation toward chondrocytes better than 2D standard culture[32]Indirect–transwell co-cultureAD-MSCs in the upper chamber and peripheral blood monocytes (CD14+) in wellThe ability of AD-MSCs to modulate the macrophage phenotype was enhanced after priming with IL-1β[29]AD-MSCs in the upper chamber and activated-M1-like, M2-like macrophages and SF cells in the lower chamberMigration assays were performed to determine if M1-like, M2-like macrophages, and SF cells influenced the migration of AD-MSCs.

        "Giannasi et al. compared the secretome composition of CM collected after 24 h or 72 h from untreated MSCs and from cytokine-primed MSCs with either tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and/or interleukin 1β (IL-1β). The pre-activation of AD-MSCs aimed to mimic the pathological milieu of OA joints in order to target their secretion towards a specific pathological phenotype. Their results indicated that pre-conditioning AD-MSCs with inflammatory cytokines induced cell activation and led to the enrichment of their secretome by several factors with recognized anti-OA effect, including anti-inflammatory, chondroprotective, and analgesic properties [38]. These findings have also been confirmed by Colombini et al.’s group, who demonstrated an enhanced immunomodulatory potential of IL-1β-primed AD-MSCs on macrophages [29]. Another study examined the role of AD-MSCs in switching activated M1-like inflammatory macrophages into M2-like anti-inflammatory phenotype, partially through the PGE2/COX2 pathway, as the authors demonstrated with isolated OA synovial macrophages. This capability supports a specific role of AD-MSCs in the therapeutic resolution of OA synovial inflammation, as well as providing evidence that IFNγ-activated M1-like macrophages represent a good cell model capable of testing AD-MSCs activity [30].",
        "Migration plays an important role in the therapeutic function of stem cells. AD-MSCs can migrate toward tissue injury sites in response to high levels of chemokines [39]. In order to assess such AD-MSCs activity, transwell inserts with large (8 μm) porous were used, allowing cells in the upper chamber to migrate through the pores. The degree of migration of different cells can then be quantified [e.g. chondrocytes [33], B [40] and T cells [41]] with or without AD-MSCs.",
        "Zhang et al. showed that AD-MSCs significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of primary articular chondrocytes when co-cultured together, suggesting that AD-MSCs may act upon endogenous chondrocytes by secreting trophic factors. Co-cultured AD-MSCs also significantly upregulated the expression of articular chondrocyte re-differentiation markers and downregulated the expression of articular chondrocyte de-differentiation markers at the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that AD-MSCs were capable of forming high-quality biomechanical articular cartilage in-vivo [33].",
        "It is important to take into account the effects of synovial cells on AD-MSCs when considering AD-MSCs as a possible therapy for inflammatory synovial disorders. Sayegh et al. demonstrated that the immunomodulatory efficiency of AD-MSCs is highly dependent upon the cytokine/articular microenvironment. AD-MSCs cultured with pro-inflammatory SF of RA patients maintained their proliferation capability and upregulated gene expression involved in immunomodulation through a TNF/NF-κB-dependent mechanism. Their results also showed that AD-MSCs exposed to pro-inflammatory SF were more effective in inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inhibiting pro-inflammatory macrophages compared to control SF obtained from a patient undergoing a trauma-related surgery [31]. Another group co-cultured SF from OA patients with AD-MSCs with the aim of mimicking the joint cavity environment. Their results showed an increase in AD-MSCs viability following SF supplementation as well as changes in several genes involved in cell survival. For example, FOS like 1 (FOSL1), which is involved in the therapeutic effect of AD-MSCs, was upregulated after SF exposure. Those authors suggested that future AD-MSC-based therapy may be further enhanced in an environment that facilitates upregulation of the expression of FOSL1, an AP-1 transcription factor subunit, expression [42]. Wesdorp et al. [43] studied the influence of synovial inflammation on MSCs migration, and whether modulation of inflammation with GCs (triamcinolone acetonide [TAA]) may influence migration. Those authors found that macrophages secrete factors that stimulate MSCs migration, and that modulation with TAA specifically increased the ability of anti-inflammatory macrophages to stimulate MSCs migration. They suggested that modulating inflammation and thereby improving MSCs migration could be a therapeutic approach based upon endogenous repair of cartilage defects.",
        "It has been suggested that the 3-dimensional (3D) spheroid, which is a multicellular aggregate formed under non-adherent 3D in-vitro conditions, may be a useful in-vitro method to better understand MSCs therapy since expression of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and other adhesion proteins as well as immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic genes are upregulated in that cell culture system [44]. AD-MSCs spheroids could therefore emerge as a promising OA treatment, although studying the appropriate methods of administration and considering their interaction with SF is essential. Toward this end, Fuku et al. [45] examined the effect of patient SF on 2D-culture AD-MSCs and spheroid AD-MSCs and observed that SF exhibited a lethal effect on AD-MSCs in 4 patients. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of such an effect of SF on AD-MSCs. Although many positive effects have been attributed to the formation of AD-MSC spheroids, Fuku’s group emphasized that the usefulness of spheroids in OA treatment should be examined in experimental conditions that are more suitable for the joint cavity environment and in a larger number of cases. They recommended that the cytotoxic activity of SF against AD-MSCs administered for therapeutic purposes into the joint cavity should be considered when improving culture methods [45].",
        "It has been shown that AD-MSCs secretum, also known as CM, possesses effects like those observed after transplantation of MSCs [46], containing many cytokines, proteins, growth factors, as well as extra cellular vehicles (EVs) with beneficial effects that can be used in regenerative medicine [47]. For example, one group treated synovium and cartilage explants with MSCs-CM to study the paracrine effect of MSCs secretome. Additionally, they used a co-culture system of synovium and cartilage explants, while preventing direct contact between cartilage and synovium, using filter inserts, creating a more complex and clinically relevant model to test AD-MSCs secretome. Using this culture setting, they found that synovial explants exposed to MSCs-CM expressed less pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL-1β, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and had reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, while upregulating multiple anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic pathways in osteoarthritic cartilage and synovium [36].",
        "EVs comprise a heterogeneous group of vesicles released by various cell types, EVs are released from cells but cannot replicate on their own. EVs can be classified into different subtypes based on their diameter: exosomes (30–100 nm), microvesicles (100–1,000 nm), and apoptotic vesicles (1–5 mm) [48] (Fig. 2A). Several studies have indicated that EVs can transfer their contents to elicit functional responses and mediate signaling through surface receptor contact between cells. EVs contain thousands of different bioactive molecules, including surface proteins, intercellular proteins, amino acids, metabolites, mRNAs, non-coding RNA species, and DNA [49] (Fig. 2B), playing an active role in various processes, such as angiogenesis, antigen presentation, cellular homoeostasis, inflammation, and immunomodulation. EVs derived from various types of MSCs have recently been explored as a novel strategy for cell-free therapy in a variety of diseases, including RA. Based upon current evidence, EV-derived MSCs have been demonstrated to be important MSCs mediators that exert similar functions, and that they can perform the indispensable functions of their parental cells. AD-MSC-derived EVs (AD-MSC-EVs) are thought to function similarly to AD-MSCs.Fig. 2AD-MSCs-derived extra-cellular vesicles (EVs) A Types of EVs; exosomes (30–100 nm), microvesicles (100–1,000 nm), and apoptotic vesicles (1–5 mm) and their mode of secretion into the extracellular space.

B Illustration of EVs encapsulation that contains biologically active cargos including proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and specific surface markers",
        "Although several studies have shown that AD-MSCs could ameliorate RA, the ones that explored the role of AD-MSC-EVs for RA treatment have emerged only recently [49].",
        "Farinazzo et al. showed that AD-MSC-EVs can partially inhibit T cells activation in-vitro, but that this effect was insufficient in-vivo. In addition, AD-MSC-EVs were shown to drive M2 macrophage polarization, thus reducing the ability of macrophages to evoke inflammatory responses. Interestingly, Rossana et al. [50] demonstrated that only the EVs that had been isolated from AD-MSCs pre-activated with IFN-γ and TNF-α induced M2 macrophage polarization. Those authors therefore suggested that the effects of the immunomodulatory AD-MSCs-EVs on macrophages may not be constitutive but rather induced by the inflammatory microenvironment.",
        "The therapeutic ability of MSCs to address OA mainly relates to the secretion of bioactive factors, which can be found within their secreted EVs. Cavallo et al. [51] demonstrated the potential of AD-MSC-derived small EVs (sEVs) by showing their effect on gene expression and protein release of both chondrocytes and synoviocytes by counteracting IL-1β-induced inflammatory effects. The inflammatory environment mediated by NF-κB pathway was significantly attenuated by sEVs. This approach can potentially be used as a new therapeutic strategy for OA therapy. Another group showed that EVs reduced the production of inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, PGE2, and NO in OA chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1β. Treatment also decreased the release of MMP activity and MMP-13 expression, whereas the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the expression of collagen II were significantly enhanced [52].",
        "In a similar model, Tofiño-Vian et al. showed that EVs from AD-MSCs reduced inflammation and oxidative stress, mostly through IL-6 and prostaglandin E2, which may mediate anti-senescence effects in OA osteoblasts, seen by the downregulation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and the reduced accumulation of γH2AX foci [53].",
        "Among the bio-active molecules in AD-MSC-EVs microRNAs (miRNAs), e.g. miR-146a [54], miR-451a [55], miR-93-5p [56], miR-376c-3p [57], have been shown to directly alleviate local inflammation and promote tissue repair. Engineering AD-MSCs, whether by pre-activation or direct transfection, is used as a novel approach for functionalizing AD-MSC-EVs for a more potent immunomodulatory and regenerative effect. Li et al. showed that miR-338-3p overexpressing AD-MSCs exosomes could inhibit chondrocyte inflammation and degradation, as seen by decreased expression of PGE2, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, MMP-3 and MMP-13, as well as by promoting chondrocyte proliferation through targeting RUNX2 [58]. Martinez-Zalbidea et al. transduced an immortalized AD-MSCs line with a CRISPR activation lentivirus system that overexpressed the TSG-6 gene and demonstrated their immunomodulatory potential in IL-1β activated intervertebral disc cells, specifically downregulating IL-8 and COX-2 [59].",
        "Adipose tissue-derived autologous cells are easier to obtain for cell-free therapy in large-scale populations, making adipose tissue a richer and safer source compared to other tissues. Proteomic analyses have shown that AD-MSC-EVs are more closely associated with immunomodulation-related proteins than those from BM-MSC-EVs [60]. In addition, AD-MSC-EVs have been shown to be more effective than BM-MSC-EVs at promoting cartilage and bone regeneration in a mouse model and they represented a superior resource for cell-free therapy [61]. Woo et al. demonstrated that AD-MSC-EVs not only promoted the proliferation and migration of human OA chondrocytes, but that they also maintained the chondrocyte matrix by increasing type II collagen synthesis and decreasing MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5 expression [62].",
        "In-vivo models are necessary for translation of novel treatments to human trials. Understanding the effects of AD-MSCs on synovial cells requires the selection of animal models of various arthritic conditions. Here, we discuss experimental models used to investigate the effects of AD-MSCs on inflammatory arthritis, OA, and metabolic arthritis.",
        "In-vivo experimental animal models of inflammatory RA are used extensively to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms governing inflammation-driven joint damage. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is the RA animal model most commonly used in basic research and drug development studies since it resembles the human RA features of typical synovitis and bone erosion manifestations. BM-MSCs were shown to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro but could not inhibit CIA disease severity [63]. In contrast, MSC-derived EVs ameliorated CIA manifestations via induction of immunomodulatory T lymphocytes [64]. Methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) is another model, and it includes local immunization with a protein antigen (BSA, ovalbumin) followed by IA administration to the affected joints. In contrast to other RA models, AIA occurs only in the injected joints and the immune response is confined to the affected joint where histological features are similar to those of RA [65]. IA administration of MSCs in that model showed reduced inflammation and cartilage damage [66], and MSCs-CM reduced disease severity and immune responses [67].",
        "Proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA) is induced by repeated immunizations with cartilage PG aggrecan in adjuvant, resulting in polyarthritis and subsequent articular cartilage and bone erosion [65]. Swart et al. [68] explored the immunosuppressive effect and mechanism of action of MSCs administrated via intraperitoneal (IP) and IA administration in a PGIA model. MSCs treatment, both via IP and IA, suppressed PGIA. MSCs were largely retained for weeks in the injection site. Those authors showed that MSCs treatment induced a more regulatory phenotype with the production of IL-4 and IL-10, but also of IFN-γ, and a systemic decrease of pathogenic antibodies, thus demonstrating the potential value of MSCs treatment in resistant arthritis.",
        "The K/BxN model and G6PI-induced arthritis are transgenic mice expressing a transgenic T-cell receptor (TcR). These mice develop spontaneous arthritis, which was shown to be B-cell dependent. The transfer of IgG antibodies from arthritic K/BxN mice to naïve mice induced transient arthritis in many different mouse strains. It has been shown that AD-MSCs therapy was unsuitable for modulating the progression of K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis. Based upon the differences in the immune status and monocytic/macrophage balance among the different arthritic models, it was suggested that the identification of cell-specific targets of MSCs will assist in predicting which RA patients will respond positively to MSCs-based therapy [69]. Wang et al. showed that IA administration of AD-MSCs attenuates RA progression by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and mitigating neutrophil infiltration and cartilage erosion, as well as promotes the reconstruction of the CX3CR1+ synovial macrophage barrier in serum-transfer arthritis model mice [70].",
        "The SKG arthritis model was developed using a point mutation in the gene coding for ZAP-70, affecting TcR signaling and eventually leading to an effect upon thymic selection of T cells and, subsequently, autoimmunity. Local transplantation of AD-MSCs and AD-MSC spheroids had a significant therapeutic effect in that model [71]. Another group showed that the administration of AD-MSCs in the SKG arthritis model has a paradoxical effect according to the disease phase during which they were administered, suggesting that the cells act differently depending upon the disease stage [71].",
        "Transgenic mice that overexpress human IL-1α are used to study the role of IL-1 in arthritis. These mice develop spontaneous polyarthritis, synovial proliferation, and cartilage and bone destruction. The cellular composition in joints changed in favor of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and macrophages [72]. Lee et al. [73] investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of BM-MSCs in an IL-1RaKO mouse model. Those authors demonstrated that BM-MSCs inhibited Th17 polarization and thereby reduced inflammation in those mice.",
        "Current animal models for OA can be broadly classified into subtypes, as described by Samvelyan et al. [74], including naturally occurring, genetically modified, surgically induced, chemically induced, and non-invasive models. Spontaneous OA models, such as naturally occurring and genetically modified ones, are commonly used to study primary OA, while invasive models, such as surgically and chemically induced ones, as well as non-invasive models are used to investigate secondary OA. Invasive models are largely used to assess the efficacy of potential OA treatments. Li et al. [75] injected AD-MSCs to rats in an OA model induced by medial meniscectomy of the knee for 8 weeks prior to AD-MSCs injection. AD-MSCs transplantation was accompanied by enhanced cartilage regeneration in those rats. Their study also demonstrated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of labeled AD-MSCs in the injured rat joints 10 weeks after their IA administration. The authors concluded that AD-MSCs persisted locally for 10 weeks in the rat joint, coinciding with the efficacy observed. It is postulated that persistence and/or proliferation of the AD-MSCs in the joint is required to exert their functions in promoting joint regeneration and/or cartilage protection, further supporting the safety and feasibility of IA administration of AD-MSCs for OA treatment [75].",
        "Zhou et al. treated OA rats with IA administration of AD-MSCs, which alleviated OA and inhibited cartilage degeneration by suppressing cartilage apoptotic damage and reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion [76]. In contrast, repeated IA administration of allogeneic BM-MSCs resulted in an adverse clinical response and aggravation of the OA. Although there were no differences in clinical parameters between autologous and allogeneic MSC-treated equines with OA after the first IA administration of these cells, there was an adaptive immune response and aggravation of OA following a second exposure [77].",
        "Mei et al. [78] evaluated the efficacy of IA administrations of culture-expanded allogenic AD-MSCs for the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT)-induced rat OA. Their results supported the protective effect of AD-MSCs on cartilage degeneration, without any notable adverse effects. MHC-unmatched AD-MSCs protected chondrocytes from inflammatory factor-induced damage. Those results revealed that the paracrine effect of AD-MSCs on chondrocytes contributes, at least in part, to the therapeutic effect of AD-MSCs in OA. Similarly, Kuroda et al. [34] found that IA administrated AD-MSCs inhibited cartilage degeneration progression in an ACLT-OA rabbit model. That effect was mediated by AD-MSCs homing to the synovium and by the secretion of factors with chondroprotective effects, such as regulating chondrocyte viability and cartilage matrix protection, specifically thorough inhibiting MMP-13. Cheng et al. used combined IA AD-MSCs and shockwave (SW) therapy in an ACLT OA rat model. The combination therapy had a chondroprotective effect as evidenced by a significantly increased bone volume, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number, as well as a significantly reduced synovitis score compared to the other treatments [79].",
        "The use of uncultured adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) consisting of AD-MSCs as well as M2 macrophages has shown therapeutic potential for OA. Onoi et al. induced OA in immunodeficient rats by destabilization of the medial meniscus and immediately injecting human SVF, AD-MSCs, or saline (control group) into the knees. The SVF group showed significantly slower OA progression and less synovitis, with higher expression of collagen II and SOX9, lower expression of MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5, and a lower M1/M2 ratio in the synovium compared with the AD-MSCs and control groups [80]. Ko et al. [81] used another therapeutic approach consisting of 3D-cultured AD-MSCs. Those authors evaluated the effect of spheroidal AD-MSCs administration on cell survival and arrest the progression of surgically induced OA in a rat model. Their results showed that AD-MSCs spheroids had better in-vitro and in-vivo survival and better chondrogenic potential, and that they exerted greater regenerative effects than AD-MSCs in single-cell suspension, probably by a paracrine mode of action. These findings support the use of stem cell-based therapeutics upon AD-MSCs spheroid forms to treat OA. Similarly, Yoon et al. [82] compared the chondrogenic differentiation capabilities of AD-MSCs in monolayer and culture in 3D suspension bioreactors. Enhanced in vivo cartilage formation was achieved by the transplantation of spheroid-cultured AD-MSCs compared to monolayer-cultured AD-MSCs. The authors attributed this to increased TGF-β3 expression and p38 activation. Their results showed that spheroid culture may be an effective method for large-scale in-vitro chondrogenic differentiation of AD-MSCs and subsequent in-vivo cartilage formation.",
        "Pain is a recurrent symptom in OA and the primary reason for medical intervention. Amodeo et al. [83] explored the efficacy of AD-MSC-CM in controlling pain and neuroinflammation in OA. Their monosodium-iodoacetate (MIA)-induced OA mouse model is largely used to evaluate pain resulting in functional impairment similar to human OA. Those authors demonstrated that AD-MSC-CM exerts a rapid and lasting relief of pain symptoms, probably through modulation of neuroinflammation. They also reported that systemic injection of AD-MSC-CM appears to be the most active route.",
        "Several animal models of hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis have been reported for in-vivo assessment. The injection of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals into various anatomical structures to induce crystal-induced inflammation has been proposed; however, only a few of these models accurately reflect the joint microenvironment in which an acute gouty attack occurs [84]. The pathogenesis of gouty arthritis, characterized by the MSU crystal deposition in the joints associated with acute flares, has been associated with NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and subsequent amplification of the inflammatory response. Medina et al.’s study tested the effect of AD-MSCs administration on the clinical inflammatory response in rabbits after MSU injection. A single dose of AD-MSCs was injected IA shortly after IA administration of MSU crystal. There was both local and systemic inflammatory response resolution in this model. Furthermore, AD-MSCs promoted M2 macrophages in the synovial membrane, inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome, and induced anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 or TGF-β, while decreasing NF-κB activity [85]. The few in-vivo models that have thus far been described in the literature for PsA include three main categories of animal models for PsA: spontaneous/gene mutant types, transgenic types, and induced types [86]. MSCs were not employed for treatment of PsA in those models.",
        "In animal models, Woo et al. showed that IA administration of AD-MSC-EVs significantly attenuated OA progression and protected cartilage from degeneration in two OA models [62]. In addition, MSCs exosomes were shown to reduce pain and repair temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (OA-TMJ) by mounting a well-coordinated response of attenuating inflammation, enhancing proliferation and matrix synthesis, while reducing apoptosis and matrix degradation to achieve overall joint homeostasis and promote TMJ repair and regeneration in an OA-TMJ animal model [87]. Tsujimaru et al. showed that AD-MSC-EVs possess immunosuppressive factors in their vesicles similar to AD-MSCs. They also showed that AD-MSCs and their derived EVs carry IL-1ra that effectively replaces its deficiency in an RA mice model, thereby improving their severe state. This effect has been shown to be comparable to that of anakinra, a recombinant IL-1ra-approved drug for RA management [88]. Wang et al. demonstrated the efficacy of exosomes derived from miR-486-5p overexpressing AD-MSCs in medial menisco-tibial ligament OA rat model. IA administration of miR-486-5p containing exosomes showed a better effect on cartilage preservation (decreased apoptosis, increased Col II and decreased Col X deposition), as well as synovial macrophage preservation (decreasing iNOS and increasing CD163 staining in synovium samples) [89].",
        "Clinical trials for evaluating the effectiveness of AD-MSCs for arthritis therapy in OA have shown promising results. Kim et al. conducted a clinical trial on 49 OA patients (55 knees) with symptoms of knee joint pain and/or functional limitations despite non-surgical treatments for a minimum of 3 months, AD-MSCs were harvested and loaded into a fibrin glue product and then surgically implanted into the lesion site. Clinical assessment scores showed significant improvement among the patients, with 74.5% of them expressing satisfaction with the resultant pain relief [90]. Interestingly, patients over 60 years of age who had lesion sizes > 6.0 cm2 showed less favorable results. Although there were some variations in the results due to these 2 factors, the overall clinical outcomes of MSC implantation in OA patients were encouraging.",
        "Pers et al. [91] reported their phase I, prospective, bicentric, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalating clinical trial of AD-MSCs therapy in 18 OA patients who were injected IA. Despite the limited number of patients and the absence of a placebo arm, the authors were able to demonstrate the safety and promising treatment potential of AD-MSCs. Freitag et al. [92] conducted a randomized trial on 30 OA patients in whom AD-MSCs were extracted from their adipose tissues and cultured until passage 2 prior to injection. Autologous AD-MSCs were then IA administered in a single injection (group 1) or in 2 injections (group 2), while the control patients received conservative management (group 3). The AD-MSCs-treated groups showed clinically significant improvement in pain reduction and function. Magnetic resonance imaging analyses showed that 37% of the participants in the first treatment group exhibited further cartilage loss compared to the control. However, ~ 89% of the patients in the second treatment group showed marked improvement or no progression in cartilage loss. Furthermore, no serious adverse events were observed in the 2 treated groups during follow-up. The authors concluded that AD-MSCs therapy is a safe and effective treatment for OA and that frequent injections are preferable.",
        "Lee et al. conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 24 patients with knee OA aged 18–75 years who had a mean pain intensity (VAS score) of 4 or higher for a minimum of 12 weeks with at least 1 grade 3–4 lesion. The patients were randomly divided into those treated with IA AD-MSCs administration and a control group administrated with saline. The AD-MSC-treated group showed significant reductions in knee pain. Their physical and radiological examination data showed that they demonstrated a wider range of knee motion and unchanged cartilage defects, in contrast to the enlargement of defects seen in the control group. It was concluded that IA administrations of autologous AD-MSCs provided satisfactory functional improvement and pain relief for OA patients, and did so without causing short-term adverse events [26, 93]. In another study evaluating the safety and therapeutic potential of autologous AD-MSCs in OA patients, 18 OA patients were enrolled and divided into three dose groups. Clinical and radiological parameters were evaluated during 96 weeks of follow-up. The high-dose AD-MSCs group exhibited better pain relief and greater improvement in knee function compared to the other 2 groups [94].",
        "Several studies have indicated that the inhibitory effect of AD-MSCs is affected by the stage of OA at which they are administered, favoring early-stage intervention with little to no effect in the late stage of the disease [95–97]. In addition, swelling of the injected joints is frequently observed and is thought to be associated with the survival rate of the AD-MSCs. Directly injected cells usually have limited cell retention and survival rates, especially in large cartilage lesions. Koh et al. reported that AD-MSCs seeded in scaffolds may have better viability, preservation, and aggregation. Those authors recommended that appropriate cell-loaded scaffolds should be developed for treating patients with large cartilage defects in order to improve the efficacy of this procedure, as well as the level of comfort of the patients [97].",
        "Compared to OA, relatively few trials have been performed with MSCs in RA. In some cases, MSCs therapy may not be suitable for RA, given the growing armamentarium of other efficient therapeutics available as opposed to OA. Although there have been a limited number of clinical trials of MSCs, especially AD-MSCs for RA therapy, the therapeutic safety and efficacy have been confirmed in several studies [26]. Vij et al. conducted a phase I/IIa non-randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single, intravenous infusion of autologous AD-MSCs over a period of 52 weeks in RA patients. The results indicated that it was safe and efficacious for the improvement of joint function in those patients [98]. In a multicenter, dose escalation, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled phase Ib/IIa clinical trial of 53 patients, Álvaro-Gracia et al. demonstrated that intravenous infusion of culture-expanded AD-MSCs was generally well tolerated and free of side effects at the dose range and time frame studied [99]. In their double-blind, ascending dose, Phase I/IIa randomized controlled trial, Freitag et al. sought to assess the safety and efficacy of an allogeneic AD-MSCs preparation (MAG200) in the treatment of knee OA over 12 months. Their results showed a reproducible and statistically significant effect over placebo, which was clinically relevant for pain in the 10 ​ × ​106 dose cohort and for function in the 20 ​ × ​106 and 100 ​ × ​106 dose cohorts. Furthermore, a trend in disease-modification was observed, with improvement in total knee cartilage volume in MAG200 10, 20, and 100 ​ × ​106 dose cohorts, but with progression of the OA in placebo group, though this was not statistically significant [100].",
        "Chen et al. evaluated the safety and efficacy of IA administration of allogeneic AD-MSCs (ELIXCYTE®) for OA knee among 57 subjects in a patient-blind, randomized, active-control trial consisting of 4 arms that consisted of a hyaluronic acid control and 3 ELIXCYTE® doses. The results showed a significantly reduced pain score at week 24 between the post-treatment visit and baseline in all ELIXCYTE® groups. Compared to HA group, those groups revealed significant decreases at week 4 in total pain scores, stiffness scores, and functional limitation scores, suggesting the potential benefit of ELIXCYTE® in earlier onset cases [101]. Similarly, Kuah et al. investigated Progenza (PRG) in-vitro expanded AD-MSCs with cell culture supernatant as potential disease-modifying treatment options for OA. Their single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study showed significant within-group improvement in pain scores from baseline at all-time points for the PRG group, with highly significant improvements seen at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 compared to the marginal improvement in the placebo group [102]. Although its safety has been extensively demonstrated, it is important to note that allogenic AD-MSCs IA administrations might have serious consequences in certain conditions. For example, Hosono et al. reported the development of severe arthritis caused by multiple IA administration with AD-MSCs for knee OA. A total of 113 patients received AD-MSCs treatment, and 75% (85/113) of them received an AD-MSCs injection at least twice with a 6-month interval. Although no obvious negative sequelae were observed in any patient after the first treatment, 53% (45/85) of the patients who received their second or third AD-MSCs injections sustained severe knee arthritis. In terms of pathophysiology, Hosono et al. found anti-histone H2B Ab in SF samples from patients who exhibited severe arthritis following the second AD-MSCs treatment [103]. Although more research is needed to determine the duration of the therapeutic effects, the optimal dosing, and the administration strategy, as well as recipient patient profiles for treatment candidates, AD-MSCs are considered to be low-risk and suitable for treatment. The source of AD-MSCs, whether autologous (derived from the patient) [90–95, 98] or allogenic (donor-derived) [99–104], as well as additional donor characteristics (Fig. 3A), should also be addressed in future research and therapeutic decisions.Fig. 3Standardization of AD-MSCs and AD-MSC-derived therapies may promote the translation into clinical practice A Identification of suitable donor candidates for AD-MSCs source isolation, being syngeneic or allogeneic transplantation, maximizing treatment potency. B Production and processing of a variety of AD-MSCs and AD-MSC-derived therapies insuring both quality and safety. C Stem cell-based therapy can be translated to clinical practice and potentially become an off-the-shelf treatment for the wide population",

        "Finally, MSCs and their derived products have immunomodulatory, chondro- and osteo-protective potential via functional changes of T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and synovial cells that help restore the synovial hemostasis, as shown in the graphical abstract. Many pathways relating to the pathogenesis of arthritis have been shown to be affected by AD-MSCs. Table 2. summarizes the underlying mechanisms of AD-MSC-mediated immunomodulation and tissue regenerative abilities across experimental models. AD-MSCs treatment has consistently been shown to reduce the levels of IL-1β and TNFα, key cytokines involved in the inflammatory response and the development of structural bone and cartilage damage in arthritis. In contrast, IL-10 and TGF-β, key regulators of immune homeostasis, are consistently increased by AD-MSCs treatment. These findings coincide with phenotypic changes from inflammatory T-cells to Tregs and from M1-macrophages to M2-macrophages.Table 2Summary of the effects of AD-MSC effects on disease-associated inflammatory cells/cytokines across arthritis modelsAD-MSCs treatment typeModelResultsReferenceT-cellsIn-vitroAD-MSCs CMRA human PBMCs↑ TGF-β, ↑ Tregs, ↓ Th17, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-17, ↓ IL-21[105]Allogeneic AD-MSCsCollagen-reactive RA human T cells; direct and transwell co-cultures↓ IFNγ, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-17, ↑ IL-10, ↑ Tregs[106]SF primed AD-MSCsActivated CD4+ T cells; direct co-culture↑ Tregs, ↓ Th1[31]AD-MSCsCD3+ T cells from CIA mouse lymph node↓ IFNγ, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-2, ↑ IL-10, ↑ TGF-β[107]AD-MSCsCon A-stimulated murine splenocytes and human PBMCs; direct co-culture↓ T-cell proliferation[108]In-vivoHuman AD-MSCs, allogeneic and syngeneic murine AD-MSCsCIA mice; intraperitoneal injection↓ Sera IgG, ↓ RANTES, ↓ Th1/Th17, ↓ IFNγ, ↓ TNFα, ↑ IL-10, ↑ Tregs[107]AD-MSCsCIA mice; Intravenous injection↓ GM-CSF+CD4+ T cells (in spleen and peripheral blood but not in the draining lymph nodes), ↑ Tregs, Tr1, and LAG-3+Tr1 cells (in the draining lymph nodes)[109]AD-MSCsSKG mice; intraperitoneal injectionCon-A stimulated splenocytes; ↓ IL-17, ↓ IL-6, ↑ IL-10, ↑ TGF-β[108]Clinical trialAD-MSCsPhase Ib/IIa clinical trialDistribution of T-cell populations, including Tregs in circulation, was not significantly modified among cohorts[99]Monocytes/MacrophagesIn vitroIL-1β primed Allogeneic AD-MSCsCollagen-reactive RA human monocytes/macrophages; direct and transwell co-cultures↑ IL-10[106]IL-1β primed AD-MSCsLPS\\IFN-γ activated CD14+ monocytes from healthy donors; transwell co-culture↑ CD206, ↑ M2-macrophages[29]AD-MSCsIFN-γ activated CD14+ monocytes from healthy donors; transwell co-culture↓ M1-macrophages (↓ IL-1β, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ MIP1α/CCL3, ↓ S100A8, ↓ S100A9), ↑ M2-macrophages (↑ IL-10, ↑ CD163, ↑ CD206, ↑ PGE2[30]SF primed AD-MSCsLPS\\IFN-γ activated CD14 + monocytes; direct co-culture↓ CD40, ↓ CD80[31]AD-MSCs and AD-MSC spheroidsPMA-differentiated, LPS activated THP-1 cells; co-culture↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6[71]Murine inguinal fat AD-MSCsCX3CR1+ synovial lining macrophages from healthy mice; direct and transwell co-culturesTranscriptome related to leukocyte cell–cell adhesion, migration, and regulation of immune effector were significantly enriched and upregulated, e.g. M2 polarization; ↑ Rac2, ↑ CCL2, enhanced barrier function in CX3CR1+ macrophages; ↑ Tjp1, ↑ F11r[70]In-vivoAD-MSCs and AD-MSC spheroidsSKG mice; IA administration↓ Macrophage infiltration[71]Murine inguinal fat AD-MSCsK/BxN serum-transfer arthritis mice; IA administrationSynovium; ↓ IL-1β, ↓ TNFα, ↑ CX3CR1+ macrophagesPeripheral blood; ↑ IL-10, ↓ IL-6, ↓ IL-1β[70]Synovial cellsIn vitroAllogeneic AD-MSCsLPS\\TNFα stimulated RA human FLS; direct and transwell co-cultures↓ TNFα, ↓ PGE2, ↓ collagenase activity, ↓ gelatinase activity[106]AD-MSCsCollagen-reactive CIA mice synovial cells; direct and transwell co-cultures↓ IL-1β, ↓ TNFα, ↓ MIP2, ↓ INFγ, ↓ IL-12, ↓ RANTES, ↑ IL-10, ↓ IL-17, ↓ IL-2, ↑ TGFβ[107]AD-MSCs from infrapatellar Hoffa fat, SC hip fat, and SC abdominal fatchondrocytes and synoviocytes; transwell co-cultures↓ IL-1β, ↓ IL-6, ↓ CXCL8/IL-8, ↓ COX2, ↑ PGE2[110]AD-MSC-EVs and CMIL-1β activated OA chondrocytes and cartilage explants↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ PGE2, ↓ NO, ↓ COX2, ↓ MMP activity, ↓ MMP-13, ↑ IL-10, ↑ collagen II[52]AD-MSC-EVs and CMIL-1β activated OA Osteoblasts↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ PGE2, ↑ IL-10, ↓ mitochondrial oxidative stress, ↓ accumulation of γH2AX foci[53]AD-MSC and AD-MSC spheroidsRA synovial fibroblasts; transwell co-cultures↓ Migration, ↓ proliferation[71]infrapatellar fat pad AD-MSCIL‐1β activated OA articular cartilage cells↑ COL2A1, ↑ Aggrecan, ↑ SOX9, ↓ MMP‐13, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ IL-1β, ↓ ROS[111]In-vivoinfrapatellar fat pad AD-MSCSprague–Dawley rats OA; IA administrationIn synovial fluid; ↓ ROS, ↓ IL-6, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-1β[111]Autologous AD-MSC and SVFSheep transected meniscus; IA administrationCondyle Immunohistochemistry; ↑ COLL2, ↓ COLL1, ↓ IL-1β, ↓ MMP13Synovial Fluid; ↓ IL-1β, ↓ CTX2, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ PGE2[112]AD-MSC derived exosomesMIA-induced rat OA model; IA administrationcartilage tissues and rat synovial tissues; ↓ β-catenin, ↓ WNT3, ↓ WNT9, ↑ COL2[57]",

        "Also of note is the wide range of AD-MSCs treatment types, including different adipose tissue sources, culture methods, priming and processing approaches (Table 2), demonstrating both the need for further research for optimizing the therapeutic effect of AD-MSCs, as well as the need for standardization prior to clinical translation (Fig. 3B).",
        "AD-MSCs therapy for inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint disorders generally exhibited positive outcomes across research platforms, including in-vitro and in-vivo animal studies as well as in human clinical trials. However, despite its immense potential, only a few MSC-based therapies have been approved. It is vital for research groups to choose the appropriate models, both in-vitro and in-vivo, understand their limitations, and work to maximize their translatability. While significant progress has been made, additional research is needed to optimize AD-MSCs and AD-MSC-derived EV treatment strategies for joint disorders. Figure 3 shows the potential of future studies investigating AD-MSCs and their derivatives products towards clinical therapeutic use. The research needs to include platforms for evaluating the safety, optimal dosing, administration routes as well as profiles of patients who are candidates for such treatment (Fig. 3A). Standardizing the method of culturing, isolating and processing AD-MSC-derived treatments (Fig. 3B), could lead to their use in clinical application for standard arthritis care (Fig. 3C).",
        "Additionally, further insights into the immunomodulatory mechanisms of AD-MSCs and AD-MSC-derived EVs in synovial joint disorders are necessary for successful translation into clinical practice. Overall, while AD-MSC-based therapies show promise for the treatment of joint disorders, further research is essential to realize their full therapeutic potential.",

RESULTS: Knee KOOS scores, knee OKS scores, and VAS pain scores changed in similar ways in the two treatment groups. Both treatment groups demonstrated significant improvement pre-procedure to post-procedure in knee KOOS scores (p < 0.0001), knee OKS scores (p < 0.0001), and VAS pain scores (p < 0.0001). Patients with K-L grade 2 showed better functional and clinical outcomes than patients with K-L grades 3 and 4 (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Both intra-articular BMAC and ADSC injections significantly improved pain and functional outcomes at 6-month follow-up in patients with KOA.

        "In osteoarthritis, degenerative joint disease results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone [1]. Among the over 60, about 10% of males and 18% of females are affected [2, 3], and osteoarthritis causes significant disability [4, 5]. Conventional conservative treatments which include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucosamine, chondroitin sulphate, omega-3 fatty acids, hyaluronic acid, and corticosteroid injections, showed limited clinical benefits [6–8], without preventing the progression of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) or providing long-term improvements in function and joint pain [9]. When KOA progresses to the final stages and non-surgical treatments fail, total knee replacement may be an effective alternative [10, 11]. However, total knee replacement is not without complications, with 20% of patients presenting with persistent pain or loss of function at 12 months [12–14]. With the recent increase in interest for regenerative medicine, patients often undergo intra-articular orthobiologic therapy for KOA and cartilage disease [15, 16]. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from autologous bone marrow cells (BMAC) or from adipose- derived stromal cells (ADSCs) included in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) [17–20], and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) obtained from autologous blood are used for these purpose [21]. MSCs are multipotent cells that show strong self-renewal capabilities, with a differentiation ability to form chondrocytes, adipocytes, and osteocytes [22]. MSCs may differentiate and participate in the regeneration of connective tissues, given their capability to home in on and attach to diseased tissue [23–25], including bone, articular cartilage, tendon, ligament and fat [22, 26–29]. Furthermore, BMAC and ADSCs exest anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, trophic, and immunomodulatory effects which can retard the progression of OA [30–32]. Though MSCs have been used in clinical practice since 1995 [33], to date there are no real guidelines and indications, and the clinical evidence of MSCs for KOA remains unclear. MSCs could be a safe and efficacious modality for cartilage repair and for regeneration in KOA [34, 35], with improvements in pain and function at short-term follow-up [36–38]. Others authors reported that MSCs for KOA have no clinical evidence [39, 40], and did not recommend their use [41]. To our knowledge, only one study directly compared the results between autologous BMAC or ADSCs as tissue sources of MSCs for symptomatic KOA [42]; there were significant improvements in clinical outcomes with both BMAC and ADSCs injections, without a significant difference in improvement between the two autologous tissue sources. Therefore, we determined whether autologous MSCs injections provide clinical and functional improvements in KOA patients, and whether the results differ between BMAC and ADSCs.",
        "Between January 2021 and April 2022, 51 patients undergoing intra-articular injection of BMAC and 51 patients undergoing intra-articular injection of ADSCs were prospectively recruited. The present study followed the principles of express in the Declaration of Helsinki and received ethic approval by the Ethic Committee of the University of Salerno (n.90578 del 19/12/2020). All patients signed written consent to participate to the study. The patients’ age, sex, body mass index (BMI), previous surgery on the affected knee, and medical comorbidities were recorded at pre-operative assessment. Selection criteria were clinical findings of KOA with radiographic evidence of degenerative joint disease on standing anteroposterior and lateral radiographies. Exclusion criteria were age over 75 years, Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0 and 1, body mass index < 18 or ≥ 35, patients with a severe (> 10°) varus or valgus deformity, concomitant involvement of ligaments and/or menisci, and infectious or inflammatory joint disease. Patients who received both knee arthroscopy and BMAC or ADSCs at the same time were excluded. The Kellgren and Lawrence (K–L) classification was used to grade the severity of osteoarthritis: grade 0 is absence of radiographic signs of osteoarthritis; grade 1 is characterized by doubtful joint space narrowing and possible osteophytic lipping; in grade 2, there are definite osteophytes and possible narrowing of joint space; grade 3 is defined by moderate multiple osteophytes, definite narrowing of joint space and some sclerosis and possible deformity of bone ends; grade 4 is a severe condition with large osteophytes, marked joint space narrowing, severe sclerosis, and definite deformity of bone ends [43]. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), and visual analog scale (VAS) were collected by one orthopedic surgeon (AP) for 102 patients in the previous week before the procedures, and at the first and 6 months from injection. The KOOS evaluates the course of knee injury and treatment outcomes [44]. It assesses 42 items in 5 separately scored subscales: Pain (nine items), Symptoms (seven items), Activities of daily living (17 items), Sport and Recreation Function (five items) and Quality of Life (four items). Scores are transformed to a 0–100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems. The OKS is a 12-item patient-reported PRO specifically developed to assess function and pain after knee surgery [45]. The score ranges from 0 (poorest function) to 48 (maximal function). VAS is used to classify knee pain, and it ranges from no pain (0) to an extreme amount of pain (10). Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. Before surgery, patient signed an informed consent that informed about the operative procedure, functional and cosmetic expectations, and possible complications related to the surgery, consenting also to be part of any outcome research.",

        "According to the main findings of the present study, intra-articular ADSCs or BMAC orthobiologic therapy improves clinical and functional scores in patients with symptomatic KOA at 6 months of follow-up with similar efficacies. Patients with mild KOA (K–L 2) treated with BMAC and ADSCs injections have better clinical and functional results than patients with moderate and severe KOA (K–L 3/4).",
        "Intra-articular MSCs for KOA may improve pain and function for 12 or 24 months, with no evidence of improvements in cartilage status in KOA [35, 36, 41, 46]. Conversely, a recent meta-analysis of 13 RCTs showed that intra-articular MSC injection was not superior to placebo in pain relief and minimum clinically important functional improvement for patients with symptomatic KOA [47]. Recently, Aletto et al. analysed the short-term clinical and functional results of 126 patients with early KOA treated with adipose-derived stem cells only and showed a statistically significant improvement of KOOS and VAS [48].",
        "In MRI evaluations of cartilage repair, current evidence showed controversial results, with no improvement in cartilage status [49–51]. An accurate pre- and post-operative planning with MRI imaging must be obtained to evaluate the improvement of cartilage status [52]. In studies without adjuvant surgery, there was no significant improvement of cartilage status after intra-articular injection of MSCs, with no difference in terms of the WORMS score than baseline. Only one study, which compared HTO and microfracture with and without MCSs injection, reported improved cartilage status in the MSC group based on MRI evaluation at 12 months [51]. Intra-articular injection of MSCs after concomitant surgery showed significantly higher MOCART score than HTO and microfracture without MSCs injection. Therefore, future studies of intra-articular injection of MSCs are necessary to accurately assess at MRI the efficacy of MSCs on cartilage status in KOA.",
        "Recent systematic reviews and network meta-analyses compared MCSs with other injectable intra-articular orthobiologic therapy [53, 54]. By 12 months, AD-MSCs and LP-PRP showed similar clinical pain relief effects, with better functional improvement with LP-PRP. Clinical efficacy of the hyaluronic acid viscosupplementation was lower than that of biological agents.",
        "The total number of MSCs present in bone marrow harvests and lipoaspirates has not yet been estimated [55]. MSCs collected from bone marrow aspirate form only a small percentage of mononuclear cells, approximately 0.001–0.02% [56]. Also, age could represent a limit for autologous harvest, in terms of the fitness of aspirate stem cell concentrate. After the age of 75, the proliferative capacity of mesenchymal cells is reduced [57]. Thus, the clinical effect of BMAC and ADSCs is most likely exerted through some concentration of MSCs in combination with angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory cytokines and growth factors [58]. From a surgical point of view, bone marrow harvesting and lipoaspiration are both simple procedures with minimal side effects. Both procedures are minimally invasive, last about 30 min, and can be carried out as an office procedure.",
        "This study has some limitations. First, the choice of treatment was not randomized. Furthermore, there was no comparison with other therapies, such as placebo or other injection such as hyaluronic acid, PRP, and corticosteroid. Another important limitation of this study was the short- term follow-up. Also, we evaluated only patient-reported outcome measures, without considering the biological effects of mesenchymal cells on cartilage repair, which can be assessed by MRI. Only another study directly compared the results between autologous BMAC or ADSCs as tissue sources of MSCs for symptomatic KOA and showed significant improvement in clinical outcomes with both BMAC and ADSCs injections, without a significant difference between the two autologous tissue sources [42]. We are aware that the highest level of evidence for effectiveness of one or the other treatment outlined in the present investigation can only be produced using a randomized study trial design. However, given the constraints of our setting, we are confident that the results are valid and reliable. The recruitment process was rigorous, data collection was performed in a strict scientific fashion, we used validated outcome measures, and the results obtained are clinically relevant. Future randomised clinical trials with longer follow-up should investigate which autologous orthobiologic tissue source is most effective in KOA.",
        "Both BMAC and ADSC intra-articular injections significantly improved pain and functional outcomes at 6-month follow-up in patients with KOA. There were no statistically significant differences between BMAC and ADCSs groups in terms of clinical and functional outcomes. Further high-quality clinical trials are required to validate these results on a larger scale.",

METHODS: Total number of 40 patients with KOA enrolled in two groups. Twenty patients received intra-articular injection of 100 x 10(6) allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AD-MSCs), and 20 patients as control group received placebo (normal saline). Questionnaire-based measurements, certain serum biomarkers, and some cell surface markers were evaluated for 1 year. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and 1 year after injection was performed to measure possible changes in the articular cartilage. RESULTS: Forty patients allocated including 4 men (10%) and 36 women (90%) with average age of 56.1 +/- 7.2 years in control group and 52.8 +/- 7.5 years in AD-MSCs group. Four patients (two patients from AD-MSCs group and two patients from the control group) excluded during the study. Clinical outcome measures showed improvement in AD-MSCs group. Hyaluronic acid and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein levels in blood serum decreased significantly in patients who received AD-MSCs (P < 0.05). Although IL-10 level significantly increased after 1 week (P < 0.05), the serum level of inflammatory markers dramatically decreased after 3 months (P < 0.001). Expressions of CD3, CD4, and CD8 have a decreasing trend during 6-month follow-up (P < 0.05), (P < 0.001), and (P < 0.001), respectively. However, the number of CD25(+) cells increased remarkably in the treatment group 3 months after intervention (P < 0.005). MRI findings showed a slight increase in the thickness of tibial and femoral articular cartilages in AD-MSCs group. The changes were significant in the medial posterior and medial anterior areas of ​​the tibia with P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively. CONCLUSION: Inter-articular injection of AD-MSCs in patients with KOA is safe. Laboratory data, MRI findings, and clinical examination of patients at different time points showed notable articular cartilage regeneration and significant improvement in the treatment group.

        "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), one of the most common types of osteoarthritis (OA), is mainly characterized by cartilage and subchondral bone impairment. In addition, meniscus and ligament injuries and synovitis could be associated [1]. Furthermore, inflammation is evidenced as a trigger factor in KOA pathogenesis and its association with KOA is directly related to the severity of pain [2]. The rising burden of this chronic degenerative disease peculiarly in developed countries [3] and increased demands for an efficient treatment for KOA have highlighted regenerative medicine as a promising approach. Regenerative medicine represents novel therapeutic modalities for KOA such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) [4], monoclonal antibodies [5], and cell-based therapies with different cells [6, 7].",
        "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)-based therapies have been considered as a therapeutic modality for KOA in numerous preclinical [8] and clinical studies [9, 10]. Considering their elite features such as high proliferative capacity, remarkable immunomodulatory features, their notable safe application, the ability to differentiate into chondrocytes, no major ethical concerns, and easy isolation and presence in a wide variety of tissues, MSCs are suitable candidates in regenerative medicine [11]. However, the momentous feature of MSCs is their unique immunomodulatory characteristics [12]. MSCs modulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), while usually increase the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) [13]. This anti-inflammatory capacity has made MSCs a rewarded option for cartilage regeneration and pain relief in KOA [11]. Moreover, lack of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86, CD40, and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II), and low expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on MSCs, results in notable immunomodulatory features and no alloreactivity [13, 14]. These properties of MSCs generate the opportunity for researchers to use allogeneic MSCs instead of the autologous cells in regenerative medicine [15].",
        "Among different sources of MSCs, adipose tissue is the mostly regarded in the last decade. Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AD-MSCs) are abundance, accessible, and due to their uncomplicated isolation procedure, and maintaining enhanced differentiation capacity for more extended time they have being applied in many clinical studies [16, 17]. Results of a meta-analysis in 2021, analyzing 19 randomized controlled trials including 811 patients, indicated superiority of AD-MSCs compared to bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) [18].",
        "Accustomed monitoring methods for following the effect of MSCs transplantation in KOA are usually limited to imaging-based methods [19, 20]. However, evaluation of some inflammatory or specific biomarkers such as IL-6 and TNF-α in body fluids has been proposed for early diagnosis, and also precise monitoring the effect of MSCs therapy in KOA [10, 21, 22].",
        "In this study, following our previous pilot study which evaluated the clinical and laboratory findings of AD-MSCs transplantation in KOA [23], we present a phase II triple-blinded randomized clinical trial for the evaluation of the efficacy of AD-MSCs for the treatment of KOA.",
        "The current study represents the phase II of a triple-blinded clinical trial conducted at Shafa Yahyaian hospital, Iran University of Medical Science, between June 2019 and September 2021, and was commensurate with the good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines and the latest version of the Helsinki Declaration. Signed informed consents were obtained from all participants after an accurate explanation of the procedure by the physicians. The trial was monitored and analyzed by the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB; Royan Institute) at Royan Institute. This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Royan Institute (IR.ACECR.ROYAN.REC.1396.138) and registered in the Iranian registry of clinical trials (IRCT, https://en.irct.ir/trial/46) with the following ID code number: identifier IRCT20080728001031N23.",
        "In this study, the stratified block randomization was performed to randomize the patients into AD-MSCs and control groups. Randomization eliminated the possible impact of age and gender on the result of intervention. Permuted block randomization with four blocks/10 patients per block resulted in equal allocation of patients in the treatment and control groups. This randomization provided unbiased selection in treatment assignments. Statistical analysis was conducted to endorse the statistical power for the considered permuted randomization.",
        "After the safety approval which was obtained in the phase I by the assessment and monitoring of three patients [23], phase II was conducted and 40 patients enrolled in two distinct groups, 20 patients at the AD-MSCs group received an intra-articular single dose of 100 × 106 AD-MSCs suspended in 5 ml normal saline (NS), and 20 patients in the control group received 5 ml NS. The patients underwent a single injection of 100 × 106 AD-MSCs in this study; this cell dose has been chosen after the review of some dose escalation studies [24, 25] which declared that high dose (100 × 106) of MSCs transplantation led to more enhancement in clinical and MRI outcomes compared to low or medium dose. In this regard, numerous studies reported the efficacy of this cell dose in KOA without any AEs [26–28]. Although some studies proposed repeated MSCs injection could be better modality in clinic [29, 30], no significant outcome measures have been reported in comparison of single vs. repeated injections. Hence, a single MSCs injection administrated in this study considering the patients’ comfort and also the lack of enough evidence indicating the superiority of repeated MSCs injections in KOA. All the patients, orthopedic surgeon who injected cells, and the interviewer who collected data were blinded to the assigned groups.",
        "The schematic overview of the study design is illustrated in Fig. 1. Eligible participants were aged 18–65 years with mild to moderate symptomatic KOA [Kellgren–Lawrence (K–L) grades of II-III] with visual analogue scale (VAS) equal or more than 3 and knee joint alignment less than 30 degree.

        "Safety assessment, as primary outcome, was conducted by recording any severe adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) during the follow-up. AEs and SAEs including allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, fever, chills, pain, injection-site reaction, sudden death, not otherwise specified (NOS), joint swelling, joint stiffness, neurological disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders; neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified gastrointestinal disorders; and infections, renal and urinary disorders were evaluated according to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 4.0.",
        "Efficacy of AD-MSC’s injection was evaluated and comprised by several questionnaires including Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), VAS, and knee osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), and Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaires at the baseline and in 3, 6, and 12 months after injection. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), KOOS, VAS, and SF-36 are self-administered questionnaires which completed by patients. The WOMAC consists of 24 items that are divided into three subscales: pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). Each item was scored on a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. To calculate the total WOMAC score, the raw scores were summed (0–96) and then transformed to a scale of 0–100. Knee osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) consists of 42 items, divided into five subscales: pain, symptoms, daily function, sport and recreation, and quality of life. Each item was scored on a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 represents no difficulty or symptom, and 4 represents extreme difficulty or severe symptom. The KOOS score was calculated by summing the scores for each subscale and averaging them, which higher scores indicate better knee function and less severe OA symptoms [31]. The VAS consists of a 10 cm line, with one end representing “no pain” and the other end representing “worst pain imaginable.” Patients were asked to place a mark on the line to indicate their level of pain intensity. The VAS score was calculated by measuring the distance in millimeters between the “no pain” endpoint and the patient’s mark. Higher scores indicated more severe pain intensity. Short Form 36 (SF-36) consists of 36 questions under 8 different subcategories including physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), body pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE), mental health (MH) that reflect the physical and mental health status of patients. The score of each subgroup was calculated separately (0–100), and the higher score represented the better patient’s condition [32].",
        "Inflammatory changes following the injection have been assessed by measuring the levels of some specific and inflammatory biomarkers including cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), hyaluronic acid (HA), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), IL-6, and IL-10 in blood serum at baseline, 1 week, and 3 months after injection. The levels of these biomarkers have been measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To measure serum COMP, HA, Il-10, and IL-6 levels using ELISA, human COMP ELISA kit (Cat. No: E1486Hu), human HA Elisa kit (Cat. No: E1374Hu), human IL-10 ELISA kit (Cat. No: E0102Hu), and human IL-6 ELISA kit (Cat. No: DE4640) were used. We followed the manufacturer’s instruction for each kit.",
        "Another monitoring strategy used in this study was evaluation of the cell surface CD markers. Cells obtained from peripheral blood samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD25 markers. Analysis of cell markers was performed at baseline, and 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after injection. In this regard, the samples were processed to obtain a single-cell suspension and remove any debris or aggregates that may interfere with the analysis by adding PBS. The next step was to stain the cells with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies that recognize specific cell surface markers. Different CD markers were detected with their specific antibodies which conjugated with fluorescent dyes to allow their simultaneous detection. After staining, the cells were washed to remove unbound antibodies. Data collection and analysis of the fluorescent intensities were made using a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, New Jersey, USA) at Royan institute.",
        "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment was conducted at baseline and 12 months after the injection. Fast spoiled gradient-echo (FSPGR) MRI protocol was used in sagittal plane using 3 Tesla system (Magnetom Tim Trio; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The thickness of distal femoral cartilage and proximal tibial cartilage was evaluated in femur lateral central (FLC), femur lateral posterior (FLP), femur lateral anterior (FLA), femur medial central (FMC), femur medial posterior (FMP), femur medial anterior (FMA), tibia lateral anterior (TLA), tibia lateral central (TLC), tibia lateral posterior (TLP), tibia medial anterior (TMA), tibia medial central (TMC), and tibia medial posterior (TMP). The one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been used to evaluate the validity of cartilage thickness changes at baseline and 1-year post-injection follow-up.",
        "The primary outcome was the difference in WOMAC score between baseline and 12 months. In this regard, the sample size was calculated according to the results of the WOMAC score in a previous study [33]. The α risk of 0.05, power of 80%, mean difference in WOMAC score of 0.5, standard deviation of 0.5 were considered in this study which resulted in the sample size of 16 participants per group. We increased the sample size per each group to 20 patients in order to enhance the reliability of our study.",
        "Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 22. Independent sample t test was used for quantitative normally distributed data and chi-square test for qualitative variables. Comparison between groups at different time points were evaluated by one-way repeated ANOVA, and Mauchly’s test of sphericity conducted for testing the assumption of sphericity to validate one-way repeated ANOVA. Furthermore, the reliability of MRI measurements was tested using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the two observations. In order to be deemed statistically significant, the P value needed to be less than 0.05 in this study.",

        "The evaluation of CD3, CD4, and CD8 markers in the AD-MSCs group at different time points had almost the same trend.

        "The present study investigated the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injection of allogeneic AD-MSCs in KOA by the assessment of clinical outcomes, MRI, some serum biomarkers, and cell CD markers in peripheral blood samples. Clinical outcome measures showed improvement in AD-MSCs group.",
        "Knee osteoarthritis is the most prevalent type of OA which has a distinct effect on the global health status [34]. Despite the availability of different conventional therapeutic methods for KOA, generally classified as surgical and non-surgical treatments, finding an innovative treatment with regenerative ability and inflammation suppression has remained non accessible. Intra-articular transplantation of AD-MSCs has been proposed as a novel minimally invasive treatment for KOA by inducing cartilage regeneration beside inflammation suppression [35, 36]. A high proliferation rate (tolerance for multiple passages without losing their stemness properties), abundance and accessibility (can be obtained through a minimally invasive liposuction procedure), strong immunomodulatory properties (low immunogenicity and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors), and chondrogenic potential have made AD-MSCs a promising option for KOA [37, 38]. The other sources of MSCs may also be effective; for instance, bone marrow is the most studied source of MSCs which has shown promises in KOA, but the superiority of AD-MSCs in comparison with BMSCs has been reported in the recent studies [18]. Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs) are the other one which it is potential in KOA examined in some studies which indicated the positive results with high proliferation rate and low risk of viral contamination [30, 39]. However, UC-MSCs have been introduced inferior to AD-MSCs in a meta-analysis which compared the efficacy of MSCs with different sources in KOA [40]. Moreover, synovial fluid and dental pulp are the other uncommon sources of MSCs due to the lack of sufficient number of MSCs and invasive harvesting procedure [41].",
        "WOMAC, KOOS, VAS, and SF-36 are the most common questionnaires available to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment modalities in patients with KOA [42]. These questionnaires were used in our study to evaluate the relevant changes in the patients’ health conditions during the 12-month follow-up. Assessment of these questionnaires together indicates the improvement of the patients’ condition in AD-MSCs group.",
        "WOMAC is one of the most common questionnaires used in similar studies [18]. The results of the present study have shown that the WOMAC score in the AD-MSCs group represented a remarkable decrease during 12 months of follow-up compared to the control group, and the mean score of this questionnaire in the AD-MSCs group 6 months after injection decreased by more than 70%. Despite the temporary decrease in WOMAC score in the control group after 3 months, this value increased remarkably and reached the baseline score. In this context, Lee and colleagues used this questionnaire at baseline and 3, and 6 months after intra-articular injection in order to investigate the effectiveness of autologous AD-MSCs in KOA. Results of their study showed remarkable decline in WOMAC score and pain reduction 6 months after injection [26].",
        "In KOOS, contrary to WOMAC, the lower score describes the worse health status of the patient. The results of our study showed a noticeable increase in the scores of all subgroups (symptoms, pain, daily function, sport and recreation, and quality of life), in the AD-MSCs injected group during the 1-year follow-up. This increasing trend was significant, while in the control group, despite a slight increase after 3 months, at the end of 12 months, no significant changes were observed compared with the baseline.",
        "According to the VAS results, the severity of pain indicated by the patients in AD-MSCs group during the 1-year follow-up showed a decreasing trend, and this reduction was noticeable. A meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials with 476 patients evaluated pain level and functionality improvement after intra-articular injection of MSCs in KOA. The results of this study indicated that transplantation of MSCs significantly reduced the VAS score during the long-term follow-up [43].",
        "According to the assessment of SF-36, the condition of the patients who received AD-MSCs was improved significantly, and this improvement was remarkable in all subgroups of the SF-36.",
        "Assessment of the questionnaire-based outcomes indicated almost the same trend during the 12-month follow-up in similar studies. The highest rate of improvement was observed 3 months post-injection then plateaued between 6 and 12 months after AD-MSCs injection. The observed trend in this study was the same as the other studies. For example, the WOMAC and KOOS outcomes in the study conducted by Freitag et al. followed a similar trend. They used single and double doses of 100 × 106 AD-MSCs in the patients with KOA. The WOMAC score and all subgroups of KOOS in the single dose group followed an improving trend up to month 3 after injection and then remained stable up to 12 months [29]. Furthermore, the results of VAS and WOMAC in the other study conducted in 2021 indicated the same pattern. Three doses (16 × 106, 32 × 106, and 64 × 106) of AD-MSCs administrated in this trial. The WOMAC total score and VAS in all intervention groups increased dramatically 3 months after injection, while reached an approximately constant value at 6, 9, and 12 months [44]. The paracrine effect of injected MSCs is certainly one potential mechanism that could be contributing to the observed outcomes. Remarkable increase in the clinical outcomes 3 months after injection was observed, probably due to the paracrine ability of MSCs by secretion of immunomodulatory cytokines and growth factors [45].",
        "MRI findings demonstrated thickness alteration in 12 different points of the femoral and tibial articular cartilage. These 12 points of articular cartilage were selected according to the cartilage areas assessed in whole-organ magnetic resonance imaging score (WORMS) in KOA [46]. Evaluation of the results of these changes indicated a significant increase in the cartilage thickness in the AD-MSCs group in just two points of the tibia (TMP and TMA). Nevertheless, in the other points, despite the increasing trend of cartilage thickness in the AD-MSCs group, any statistically meaningful different was not observed between the AD-MSCs and control groups. Considering the increasing trend of cartilage thickness in the AD-MSCs group in most of the mentioned points (except for the antero-lateral femur and tibia articular cartilage, where the thickness decreased after 1 year), future studies with large population are suggested to show the possible improvement. In a similar clinical trial, Khalifeh Soltani et al. evaluated the chondral thickness by the use of magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) after the 6 months of allogeneic placental MSCs transplantation in KOA. Their results declared nearby 10% increase in chondral cartilage thickness after 6 months in case group [47].",
        "Also, articular cartilage evaluation by MRI has considered in the similar randomized trials by the use of common scoring systems. For instance, in 2019, after intra-articular injection of autologous AD-MSCs, researchers examined the modification of articular cartilage based on MRI osteoarthritis knee scores (MOAKS) between two treatment groups (a single dose of 100 × 106 AD-MSCs and double doses of 100 × 106 with 6-month intervals), and control group. Their results showed that 12 months after the first injection, the symptoms were alleviated in the patients receiving double doses of AD-MSCs, while in spite of the improvement in the MOAKS, it was not significant [29]. Furthermore, the results of the study conducted by Zhao et al. with 18 participants in three different doses, who underwent intra-articular injection of allogeneic human AD-MSCs (the low-dose, mid-dose, and high-dose received groups with 1.0 × 107, 2.0 × 107, and 5.0 × 107 cells, respectively), indicated that significant improvement in the symptoms was evaluated by WOMAC and SF-36, and structural modifications of articular cartilage were confirmed by multi-compositional MRI sequences. However, any remarkable difference has not been reported in WORMS between groups [19]. However, none of the mentioned studies reported a separate score of the changes in cartilage thickness. In this regard, considering cartilage thickness and volume in future studies for more accurate monitoring of the MSCs effects in cartilage regeneration in KOA is proposed.",
        "Assessment of biological markers is indicated for the early diagnosis of inflammatory diseases such as OA, and also for monitoring the potency of the treatment methods [48]. In the present study, three OA specific biomarkers (COMP, HA, and MMP-3) and two inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-6) in blood samples were investigated in different time points. Noticeable reduction of COMP level in the blood serum of the patients in AD-MSCs group after 3 months indicated cartilage damage alleviation and the effectiveness of the transplantation of AD-MSCs in KOA. Yang et al. [49] in a OA cohort study showed that COMP is a promising predictor of cartilage destruction, which its higher level usually associates with synovitis in KOA. Furthermore, An et al. in a preclinical study indicated that human AD-MSCs administration leads to the reduction of elevated COMP serum concentration in KOA rabbits [50].",
        "In addition, the expression level of HA in AD-MSCs group diminished significantly and the average serum level of HA among the patients who received AD-MSCs injection, decreased by 47.18% after 3 months compared with the baseline. The correlation between serum HA concentration and OA has been evidenced in numerous literatures [51, 52]. Serum HA has been proposed as an alternative tool besides conventional diagnostic methods for early detection of KOA and monitoring the disease progression [53].",
        "Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) is another early KOA biomarker investigated in this study. Despite a slight decrease in the concentration of MMP-3 in the AD-MSCs group after 3 months, any significant difference was not reported between AD-MSCs and control group. The results of some studies conducted for the assessment of any association between MMP-3 level and OA severity indicated that the elevated level of MMP-3 correlates with severe OA [54–56]. Nonetheless, MMP-3 is an enzyme that is involved in the degradation of various ECM proteins. Its association has been reported in other physiological and pathological conditions and is not specific to cartilage degradation [57]. However, numerous preclinical studies investigated serum level of MMP-3 in osteoarthritis after MSCs transplantation in animal models. For instance, Lee et al. [58] evaluated the level of MMP-3 after using membrane-free components of AD-MSCs in OA rats. They proposed that reducing trend of MMP-3 levels may be an indicator for alleviation of cartilage destruction after applying this treatment method. Furthermore, the reduction of MMP-3 expressed by chondrocytes was reported in another animal study after BMSCs transplantation in New Zealand rabbits in KOA model [59]. In spite of the MMP-3-level assessment following the MSCs transplantation in KOA in different animal models, to the best of our knowledge no clinical trial evaluated the changes of this marker after MSCs therapy in KOA. In the present study, in spite of the significant reduction in serum COMP and HA, any meaningful changes in MMP-3 serum concentration were not observed. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is the main component of the cartilage ECM, and COMP is a protein that is produced by chondrocytes and is specifically presented in cartilage ECM, while MMP-3 is not specific to cartilage degradation [57, 60]. Hence, the serum levels of COMP and HA may be more correlated with OA progress or improvement compared to the MMP-3 serum concentration. Although no significant changes in MMP-3 level were reported, a slight decreasing trend in the AD-MSCs group may suggest evaluation of MMP-3 serum concentration in future studies with larger population.",
        "The serum level of IL-6, an upstream pro-inflammatory cytokine with complex roles in diseases with inflammatory background, was declined after MSCs transplantation in consequence of modulating immune system [61]. Serum concentration of IL-6 is proposed as an indicator of OA severity, and its association with cartilage destruction is endorsed in many clinical investigations [62]. In this regard, Li and colleagues evaluated the level of this marker as a post-treatment indicator after the injection of BMSCs in patients with KOA. They showed that the secretion of this marker significantly declined at 6 and 12 months after injection [22]. This inflammatory marker has also been examined in the present study, and the results showed that the expression level of IL-6 in the AD-MSCs group significantly decreased during the 3-month follow-up, indicating that AD-MSCs by immune system modulation alleviated the inflammation triggered by KOA.",
        "Interleukin-10 is the other inflammatory cytokine which MSC therapy affects its secretion. The IL-10 expression increased by MSCs in order to reduce the proliferation of T cells to modulate the immune system. This anti-inflammatory cytokine along with other markers such as TGF-β1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune system by inhibition of lymphocytes proliferation and maturation of dendritic cells [63]. In this respect, Sofia et al. [64] have shown that serum IL-10 levels were increased in OA rats after treatment with Wharton jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (WJ-MSCs). Regarding this anti-inflammatory cytokine, our results showed that in the AD-MSCs group, a significant elevation in IL-10 expression was observed after 1 week, which indicates the impact of AD-MSCs in down-regulation of the immune system to avoid rejection after allogeneic AD-MSCs transplantation. Afterward, expression of this cytokine showed a remarkable decline after 3 months, which may be occurred due to reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6). The pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are in a complex interaction. According to the previous basic studies, IL-6 has been shown to stimulate the production of IL-10 to regulate the immune response and prevent excessive inflammation. Hence, IL-6 reduction leads to the decrease in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation rate (the most common pathway that has been implicated in the promotion of IL-10 secretion) which results in the inhibition of IL-10 expression [65, 66]. In the control group, no changes in the secretion of IL-10 were reported.",
        "To show that if AD-MSCs can lead to the reduction of inflammation in KOA, the percentage of cells expressing CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD25 was analyzed in blood. These CD markers may be suggested as additional inflammatory indicators in OA, due to the recent reports that elucidate T helper (Th) cells which are involved in the pathogenesis of OA [67]. Synovial fluid analysis could reflect the changes in inflammation status better, but collecting the peripheral blood sample is safe, more feasible, and noninvasive than synovial fluid samples. Moreover, the findings of several studies indicated correlation between synovial fluid and peripheral blood CD markers in patients with OA [68, 69].",
        "In our study, the results of the evaluation of CD3, CD4, and CD8 in the blood serum of patients who received AD-MSCs had almost followed a similar decreasing trend at different time points during the 6-month follow-up. A dramatic reduction in the percentages of cells expressing these markers accrued after 1 week due to the immune-regulatory features of AD-MSCs. Then, approximately a plateau has been observed in the trend of these markers during 6-month follow-up. The expression level of each of these markers reached a relatively stable values, which were well below the baseline levels between 3 and 6 months after injection. This decrease in the expression of the mentioned cell surface markers 6 months post-injection in the AD-MSCs group, compared with the baseline levels, can be attributed to the alleviation of KOA-induced inflammation. While in the control group, the levels of CD3 and CD8 were almost constant during the 6 months, the percentage of CD4+ cells increased slightly 3 months after injection, which are in association with other findings investigated in this study such as the results of OA index biomarkers and various analyzed questionnaires. Enhancement in CD4+ cells population is possibly caused by the progression of OA. Furthermore, CD25+ cells increased dramatically in the AD-MSCs group in comparison with the control group. CD25 is usually expressed in low levels in humans and is one of the markers expressed by T regulatory (Treg) cells. Treg cells are a subgroup of T cells that modulate immune system responses by inhibiting the proliferation of T cells and the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β. It has been shown that MSCs contribute to the activation of Treg cells in order to modulate the immune system [70].",
        "The results of our study showed that single intra-articular injection of 100 × 106 allogeneic AD-MSCs was not associated with any SAEs which is consistent with the results of studies which used the same cell dosage [26–28]. Additionally, considering the inflammatory markers assessment besides the wide range of outcome measures revealed the remarkable efficacy of this method in KOA. The improvement in clinical outcomes such as WOMAC, VAS, KOOS, and SF-36 was reported by most of the similar clinical trials which evaluated autologous and allogeneic MSCs [20, 71]. However, the expression of two inflammatory serum markers following MSCs therapy was reported only by one study, Li et al. in 2020, which evaluated the inflammation modulation after MSCs administration in KOA. Their finding revealed the remarkable reduction in TNF-α and IL-6 levels in MSCs group indicating decrease in the inflammation which was in accordance with our results [22].",
        "Translation of this multiple assessment findings proposed that intra-articular transplantation of AD-MSCs alleviates KOA complications due to inflammation modulation and induction of cartilage regeneration. Administration of allogeneic AD-MSCs is safe and improves clinical signs and symptoms. The analyzed end points suggested pinnacle enhancement in WOMAC, VAS, KOOS, and SF-36 after 6 months. For future investigations, clinical trials with large populations, considering repeated booster doses with 6-month intervals, and assessment of more biological markers in synovial fluid following the AD-MSCs transplantation are recommended.",

    "title": "Clinical-grade extracellular vesicles derived from umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells: preclinical development and first-in-human intra-articular validation as therapeutics for knee osteoarthritis. degradation. Persistent low-grade inflammation defines OA pathogenesis, with crucial involvement of pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages. While mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and their small extracellular vesicles (sEV) hold promise for OA treatment, achieving consistent clinical-grade sEV products remains a significant challenge. This study aims to develop fully characterized, reproducible, clinical-grade batches of sEV derived from umbilical cord (UC)-MSC for the treatment of OA while assessing its efficacy and safety. Initially, a standardized, research-grade manufacturing protocol was established to ensure consistent sEV production. UC-MSC-sEV characterization under non-cGMP conditions showed consistent miRNA and protein profiles, suggesting their potential for standardized manufacturing. In vitro studies evaluated the efficacy, safety, and potency of sEV; animal studies confirmed their effectiveness and safety. In vitro, UC-MSC-sEV polarized macrophages to an anti-inflammatory M2b-like phenotype, through STAT1 modulation, indicating their potential to create an anti-inflammatory environment in the affected joints. In silico studies confirmed sEV's immunosuppressive signature through miRNA and proteome analysis. In an OA mouse model, sEV injected intra-articularly (IA) induced hyaline cartilage regeneration, validated by histological and muCT analyses. The unique detection of sEV signals within the knee joint over time highlights its safety profile by confirming the retention of sEV in the joint. The product development of UC-MSC-sEV involved refining, standardizing, and validating processes in compliance with GMP standards. The initial assessment of the safety of the clinical-grade product via IA administration in a first-in-human study showed no adverse effects after a 12 month follow-up period. These results support the progress of this sEV-based therapy in an early-phase clinical trial, the details of which are presented and discussed in this work. This study provides data on using UC-MSC-sEV as local therapy for OA, highlighting their regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties and safety in preclinical and a proof-of-principle clinical application.

        "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent progressive multifactorial joint disease and is characterized mainly by the deterioration and loss of articular cartilage. OA is one of the main sources of chronic pain and disability in developed countries, causing substantial costs to the health and employment welfare systems [22, 24, 51]. The knee is the most affected joint, accounting for almost four-fifths of the OA burden worldwide [14]. To date, knee OA does not have treatments capable of delaying cartilage deterioration or restoring the function of the articular cartilage, basing its treatment on the symptomatic control of pain and joint stiffness through multimodal approaches [32].",
        "The pathogenesis of OA is intricate and heterogeneous, with low-grade chronic inflammation recognized as a pivotal process in its onset and progression [75]. Prominent features of OA include chronic synovitis and cartilage degeneration, and emerging evidence suggests that synovial inflammation precedes cartilage degeneration [88]. Macrophages in synovial tissue, particularly the pro-inflammatory M1-like subtype, play a crucial role in initiating, sustaining, and amplifying inflammation by releasing cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α [19]. Conversely, M2-like macrophages, with an anti-inflammatory phenotype, secrete cytokines like IL-10, which are essential for tissue repair and inflammation resolution [19]. In patients with OA, synovitis is characterized by an increased number of M1-like macrophages that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) [84,95], which contributes to inflammation, matrix dysregulation, and cartilage damage [44, 92]. The impact of ROS on chondrocytes has been extensively documented, demonstrating that oxidative stress induces apoptosis in primary cartilage cells [27, 53]. In animal models of OA, reducing pro-inflammatory mediators and ROS levels ameliorates crucial pathophysiological aspects of OA, underscoring the control of inflammation and oxidative stress as a targeted therapeutic strategy for OA treatment [3, 41].",
        "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been widely studied as a possible biological therapy for OA, highlighting their clinical intra-articular (IA) application as a potential modality capable of halting or potentially reversing the degradation of articular cartilage in animal models [77]. This therapeutic effect has been intricately linked to small extracellular vesicles (sEV), which demonstrate similar paracrine tissue regenerative capabilities to their cellular counterparts while presenting a cell-free and safer product [39, 68, 86, 91]. In animal models of OA, therapies utilizing MSC-sEV have demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy by promoting cartilage regeneration and mitigating OA progression through the modulation of immune reactivity [96], restoring cartilage matrix homeostasis [98] and chondrogenic stimulation [12]. Therapeutic outcomes depend mainly on the origin of the parental cell [6]. Although there are no clinical reports of IA administration of MSC-sEV therapeutics in patients with OA, clinical cases of graft-versus-host disease [33] and chronic kidney disease [59] have reported good tolerability after systemic administration, which substantiates the ongoing early-stage clinical development of sEV-based therapeutics.",
        "Pursuing standardized manufacturing protocols to produce clinical-grade products with defined critical quality attributes poses a significant challenge for clinical research groups. Ensuring consistency and reproducibility across diverse production batches remains paramount [67]. The governing principle of \"the process is the product\" necessitates stringent delineation, characterization, and oversight at every manufacturing phase, from initial parental tissue selection to the ultimate packaging of the final product. This strict process design should integrate preclinical evidence and be meticulously formulated within a regulatory framework. Despite ongoing efforts, no clinical-grade sEV-based products have yet obtained market approval from regulatory agencies for any medical indication, including OA treatment.",
        "According to our previously published data, the umbilical cord (UC) is the most promising source of MSC for treating OA due to its superior chondrogenic capacity and ability to suppress T-cell proliferation in vitro, along with lower angiogenic properties compared to bone marrow and other sources of placental origin [23]. The results were validated in a Phase I/II Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial and in a Phase I Dose Escalation Clinical Trial conducted in 2019 (NCT No. 02580695) [47, 48]. Given that the mechanism of action (MoA) underlying this therapy is highly associated with sEV, we aimed to develop a clinical-grade therapy based on UC-MSC-derived sEV to treat knee OA. The objective of this study is to investigate their efficacy and safety profile. To ensure consistent production of the therapeutic product, we initially developed a standardized research-grade manufacturing protocol. We extensively studied the efficacy, safety profile, and underlying MoA using various in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches. Subsequently, this manufacturing process underwent adaptation, homologation, and validation to adhere to good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations, ensuring compliance with quality standards for clinical use. Finally, the clinical-grade product underwent its first safety assessment in human through IA administration of the knee joint. Our results showed a complete characterization of sEV derived from UC-MSC under non-cGMP conditions. We identified consistent miRNA and protein profiles across multiple batches, indicating the potential of a standardized manufacturing process. This research offers a comprehensive insight into the preclinical characterization and initial clinical application of UC-MSC-derived sEV as an IA therapy for OA, emphasizing their regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties and safety profiles, as well as proof-of-concept engineering of sEV to incorporate an exogenous miRNA cargo for delivery in key cell lineages involved in OA. The work presented here culminates in the design of an early-phase clinical trial that is poised and expected to begin enrollment immediately. This trial uses a defined dose-escalation protocol of UC-MSC-sEV for the treatment of knee OA. The primary objectives of this trial will be to evaluate safety, feasibility, and toxicity and to determine the optimal feasible dose for consecutive trials.",
        "Preclinical sEV batches were obtained as reported previously [20]. Briefly, UC-MSC from three donors in passage 5 were seeded and expanded in a maintenance medium composed of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), high glucose, supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (10,000 U/mL and 10,000 μg/mL, respectively), 1% L-glutamine (200 mM) (all from Gibco, Paisley, United Kingdom), and 5% human platelet lysate (hPL) on 10-layer Nunc™ EasyFill™ Cell Factory™ systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States, Cat. #140400) with a density of 6250 cells/cm2. After cells reached ∼70–80% confluence, the maintenance medium was discarded, and cells were washed three times with PBS 1X before addition of the induction media (DMEM high glucose + 1% L-Glutamine) for sEV production for 48 h. The recovered medium was clarified by serial centrifugations and filtrations. After obtaining the total supernatant (SN), the sEV were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the SN was discarded, and the sEV were washed with PBS 1X. The suspension was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The SN was again discarded, and the precipitated sEV were resuspended in the remaining PBS 1X and then preserved at − 80 °C until use. Ethical approval for the donation of umbilical cords to obtain stem cells with a therapeutic purpose was obtained from the Scientific Ethical Committee of the public agency Servicio de Salud Metropolitano Oriente (CECSSMO050612) and written informed consent was obtained from the umbilical cord donor.",
        "sEV characterization for size, concentration, identity, and purity assessment was performed according to MISEV guidelines [87], following the protocols previously described by our group [20] with no changes in the antibodies or equipment used. Briefly, the size mode (nm) and concentration (particles/mL) of the sEV preparations were assessed by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) using a NanoSight NS300 system (Malvern Instruments Limited, United Kingdom), considering the sample dilution in the respective sEV suspension solution (PBS or Ringer Lactate). The presence of tetraspanins CD63, CD81, and CD9 (sEV surface markers), CD44 and CD90 (MSC origin markers) (BioLegend, United States of America, Cat. #397502 and Cat. #328102, respectively) and HLA DR/DP/DQ and HLA A/B/C (major histocompatibility complex class I and class II antigens, respectively) (BD Biosciences, United States of America, Cat. #564244 and eBioscience Cat. #14-9983-82) was evaluated by flow cytometry on a FACSCanto™ II cytometer (BD Biosciences, United States of America). The acquired data were analyzed using FlowJo software (V10, BD, United States of America). The presence of Syntenin-1 (sEV endosomal origin marker), Flotillin-1 (sEV membrane marker), Calnexin (endoplasmic reticulum marker), and TOMM20 (mitochondria marker) was evaluated by western blot. The structure of sEV was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) following a previously standardized protocol established by our group [20, 94]. Images were captured using a Talos™ F200C G2 (Scanning) TEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the Advanced Microscopy Facility UMA-UC (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile). sEV staining for in vitro and in vivo tracking was performed according to a previously established protocol by our group [20, 69] using the lipophilic near-infrared fluorescent cyanine dye DiR (Biotium, United States of America, Cat. #60017) as sEV-membrane staining agent and washed using MW 3000 size-exclusion exosome spin columns (Invitrogen, United States of America, Cat. #4484449) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The stained particles were analyzed using NTA as described previously [20].",
        "Three independent UC-MSC donors were selected for the production and enrichment of sEV. The obtained sEV were characterized by NTA to determine the size mode and particle concentration and by flow cytometry to evaluate CD63 expression as sEV marker (> 90% of positive events). A value of 4 × 109 sEV particles of each UC-MSC donor was used for miRNA profiling and proteomics.",
        "The sEV-miRNA cargo profile was determined using the services of FIRALIS S.A. (Huningue, France; www.firalis.com). Briefly, miRNA profiling was performed using HTG/EdgeSeq Whole Transcriptome Assay (WTA; 2083 miRNAs), followed by sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq 500. The data obtained were normalized before the comparative analyses. The miRNA enrichment percentages were calculated by considering the number of reads of a particular miRNA and the total number of reads in the sample.",
        "For sEV-protein cargo identification, label-free quantification (LFQ) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry was performed at the Clinical Proteomic Platform of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine & Biotherapy of the University of Montpellier (Montpellier, France). For this purpose, sEV were lysed, and the proteins were reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin using magnetic beads. The peptides were desalted and injected into a nanoLC-Q-TOF Impact II (Bruker, United States of America). Protein identification was performed with Maxquant software (V1.6.17.0; Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Germany). The parameters used were the following: trypsin as digestion enzyme, 1 as the number of missed cleavages, a tolerance of 10 ppm for parent ions and 0.05 Da for MS/MS spectra, the minimum peptide size was 5 amino acids, the maximum peptide mass was 4.600 Da and a protein identification false discovery rate (FDR) was set at 2.5%. The UniProt database was used as the reference (V01/02/2021). The initial protein amount normalized to LFQ intensities for each protein before data processing was performed using the LFQ-Analyst platform. Proteins that were considered contaminants and redundant were removed. LFQ data for each protein were transformed using the log2(x) formula. The data were then normalized to a normal distribution and missing values were imputed using the BCPA (Bayesian missing value imputation) method.",
        "For in vitro studies, human osteoarthritic chondrocytes (huOAC), synoviocytes, and monocytes were procured following established protocols, which were reviewed and approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee of Universidad de Los Andes (approval certificate #CEC2021077). Tissue samples were collected after obtaining written informed consent from the donors, adhering to the institutional guidelines of the Universidad de los Andes. The isolation and expansion of huOAC were performed using previously described methodologies [65]. Briefly, huOAC and synoviocytes were isolated from joint tissues of patients who underwent total knee or hip replacement surgery. The cartilage tissue for huOAC isolation was sectioned into thin slices and subjected to one hour-long digestion using a protease solution (Merck KGaA, Germany, Cat. #P5147) at 37 ºC under continuous agitation. This was followed by secondary digestion in a collagenase II solution (Sigma-Aldrich, United States of America, Cat. #C6885) for 16 h at 37 °C under constant agitation. Synoviocytes were obtained by slicing the synovial membrane into approximately 1 mm2 pieces and digesting them in a collagenase I solution (Sigma-Aldrich, United States of America, Cat. #C0130) under similar conditions. After digestion, huOAC and synoviocyte samples were filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer (FALCON, United States of America, Cat. #352340) to eliminate undigested tissue. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, United States of America, Cat. #10437028), 1% P/S, and 1% L-glut under standard culture conditions. Monocytes were derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from healthy blood donors using Ficoll-Paque™ PLUS (Cytiva, Sweden, Cat. #171440002) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Monocytes were isolated using the EasySep™ Human Monocyte Isolation Kit (StemCell Technologies™, Canada, Cat. #19359) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Upon isolation, monocytes were cultured in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM; Gibco, United States of America, Cat. #12440–053) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, 1% L-glut, 20 mM HEPES (Gibco, United States of America, Cat. #15630080), 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, United States of America, Cat. #21985–023), and 1% MEM non-essential amino acids (Gibco, United States of America, Cat. #11140–050) under standard culture conditions. Additionally, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; 20 ng/mL) (BioTechne, R&D Systems, Cat. #216-MC) was immediately added to the culture media to induce monocyte-macrophage differentiation.",
        "The PKH26-stained sEV internalization assay in huOAC, synoviocytes and macrophages was performed as previously described with some modifications. Briefly, PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, United States of America, Cat. #PKH26GL)-stained sEV were added to the culture media of either huOAC, synoviocytes or macrophages (1 × 108 particles per 200,000 cells). After 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA and permeabilized with a PBS 1X + Triton X-100 0.1% solution for 10 min on vertical agitation. huOAC and synoviocytes were stained with phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 488 at a 1:600 dilution (Invitrogen, United States of America, Cat. #A12379) and macrophages were stained with anti-CD206 at a 1:500 dilution (Biolegend, United States of America, Cat. #321110). Finally, the cells were washed three times with PBS 1X before mounting on 12 mm glass slides using Fluoroshield with DAPI (Abcam, United States of America, Cat. #ab104139). Samples were left to dry at RT for at least 30 min, after which images were taken using a confocal microscope (SP8, Leica, Germany).",
        "DiR-stained sEV internalization assay was performed in huOAC cells according to a previously established protocol by our group [2, 20, 69], with some modifications. Briefly, 10,000/well of huOAC were seeded in 4-well plates and cultured in 300 μL/well of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glut, and 1% P/S. After 24 h, cells were washed three times with PBS 1X, and a solution of 300 μL of DMEM (supplemented with 1% L-glut) containing DiR-stained sEV (35 × 103 particles per cell) was added per well. As an internalization control, a second 4-well replicate was cultured in parallel; however, once the sEV were added, they were incubated at 4 °C. After 16 h, cells were detached and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCanto™ II cytometer (BD Biosciences, United States of America), and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software (V10, BD, United States of America). For confocal microscopy imaging, huOAC (30,000 cells/well) were cultured on a 10 mm cover glass coated with Poly-L-Lysine in a 4-well plate. The cells were treated with 30 × 103 DiR-stained sEV/cell. Following a 16 h incubation period, huOAC were rinsed thrice with PBS 1X and fixed at room temperature (RT) for 30 min using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Subsequently, nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma Aldrich, United States of America, Cat. #63493) at a 1:2,000 dilution for 15 min at RT, and the samples were then mounted on a microscopy slide using fluorescence mounting medium (Dako, United States of America, Cat. # S3023). The acquired images were examined using a confocal microscope (SP8, Leica, Germany).",
        "Engineered sEV were developed using electroporation to enrich them with a synthetic miRNA derived from Caenorhabditis elegans (cel-miR-39) (Ambion, United States of America, Cat. #4464076; Assay ID: MC20682). For this, sEV (2 × 109 particles) loaded with cel-miR-39 (360 nM) were resuspended in buffer containing sucrose (50 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich, United States of America, Cat. #S7903) in a total volume of 100 μL. Electroporation was performed using a single 4 mm cuvette in a Nucleofector electroporation system (Lonza, Germany, Cat. #AAF-1002B & AAF-1002X) following the ER-113 program. After electroporation, the sEV were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C for membrane stabilization. Subsequently, RNAse A (Thermo Scientific, United States of America, Cat. #EN0531) was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/mL and incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min. The treated sEV were stored at − 80 °C for at least 24 h before downstream analysis. Quantification of the miRNA loaded within the sEV involved: RNA extraction (TRIzol Reagent, Invitrogen, United States of America Cat. #15596026), reverse transcription (Applied Biosystems, United States of America, Cat. #43366596), qPCR (TaqMan, United States of America, Cat. #4440040), and miRNA cel-miR-39 TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems, United States of America, Cat. #4427975; Assay ID: 464312_mat). The engineered sEVs’ ability to transfer miRNA cargo was assessed on huOAC, synoviocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages by culturing them for 24 h with engineered sEV loaded with cel-miR-39 and sEV loaded with a scrambled sequence (Ambion, United States of America, Cat. #4464076; Assay ID: MC20682) was used as the control (15,000 particles/cell). Following the abovementioned protocols, RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and qPCR analyses were conducted to determine cel-miRNA-39 transference to cells.",
        "Monocytes isolated from three healthy donors were used in a monocyte-derived macrophage (hmMØs) differentiation assay. Monocytes were seeded on a flat-bottom 96-well plate (100,000 cells/well) and cultured under standard conditions for 6–7 days in 250 μL of MLR medium (10% FBS, 1% P/S 1%, L-glut, 20 mM HEPES, 1% Non-Essential Amino Acid solution and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s medium) supplemented with 20 ng/mL M-CSF (BioTechne, United States of America, Cat. #216-MC). Half of the cell culture medium was discarded every other day, and fresh MLR/M-CSF supplemented medium was added. After six days of culture, monocytes were differentiated into macrophages and characterized by flow cytometry using fluorophore-conjugated antibodies for CD68 and CD11b detection (both from BioLegend, United States of America, Cat. #333816 and Cat. #101206, respectively). At this point, sEV treatment was started at 1 × 108 sEV/well in MLR/M-CSF supplemented medium (100 μL). After 24 h, the SN was collected to study the cytokine secretion by macrophages using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and macrophages were detached to determine their polarization status by flow cytometry. The secreted Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels were determined by ELISA (Human DuoSet ELISA, R&D Systems, United States of America, Cat. #DY217B-05, DY293B-05, DY206-05, DY210-05, and DY201-05, respectively) following the manufacturer’s instructions. To evaluate the polarization status of hmMØs, CD68 and CD11b were used to discriminate double-positive cells. Antibodies against HLA-DR (BD Biosciences, United States of America, Cat. #564244) and CD86 (BioLegend, United States of America, Cat. #305420) were used for pro-inflammatory immunophenotyping (M1 polarization markers), and antibodies for CD206 and CD163 detection (BioLegend, United States of America, Cat. #321110 and Cat. #333606) were used for anti-inflammatory immunophenotyping (M2 polarization markers). Normalization of the median fluorescence intensities (MeFI) of each M1 and M2 marker against the MeFI values obtained in no-treatment control macrophages was used to determine the polarization status of the cells: a higher proportion of HLA-DR and CD86 MeFI’s in comparison to CD206 and CD163 MeFI’s was an indicative of pro-inflammatory M1-like polarization; on the contrary, a higher fold change of CD206 and CD163 MeFI’s in comparison to HLA-DR and CD86 was indicative of anti-inflammatory M2-like polarization. Cell viability staining (1:500, LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit; Invitrogen, United States of America, Cat. #L34975) was added to each sample for dead cell removal. Flow cytometry data acquisition was performed using a FACSCanto™ II cytometer (BD Biosciences, United States of America). The acquired data were analyzed using the FlowJo software (V10, BD, United States of America).",
        "Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release-based sEV cytotoxicity assessment was performed in huOAC following the manufacturer’s instructions (Cytotoxicity Detection KitPLUSLDH; Roche, Germany, Cat. #04 744 926 001). Briefly, huOAC (2,900 cells/well) were plated on a 96-well flat-bottom cell culture plate and cultured in complete medium (100 μL/well; 10% FBS, 1% P/S 1% and L-glut in DMEM). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 1% L-glut after three washes with PBS 1X, and sEV were added according to the following doses: dose 1 = 100 × 106 sEV/well; dose 2 = 400 × 106 sEV/well. After 24 h, SN was recovered to quantify LDH following manufacturer’s instructions. The negative control corresponded to untreated huOAC, whereas the positive control corresponded to Triton X-100 treated huOAC.",
        "To evaluate the chondroprotective potential of sEV, menadione was used as a cell death-triggering agent in huOAC. For this purpose, huOAC (100,000 cells/well) were seeded in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, 1% L-glut (300 μL/well) in a 24-well plate. Once 80% confluence was reached, 20 μM of menadione (Sigma-Aldrich, United States of America, Cat. #M5750-25G), and 1 × 108 sEV/well were added to fresh media (300 μL). Control wells without menadione, or menadione + sEV were also considered. After 6 h, PBS 1X containing 2% FBS (300 μL) was added to each well to wash and stop the menadione effect. Immediately, the SN was recovered and reserved, and the adherent cells were dissociated using TrypLE Express Enzyme (150 μL/well; Gibco, United Kingdom, Cat. #12605093). Next, PBS 1X containing 2% FBS (150 μL/well) was again added to recover the cells that may have remained attached to the wells. SN was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain a cellular pellet for further evaluation of apoptosis using FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen, United States of America, Cat. #556547) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For this, a mix of Annexin V (1.25 μL) and Propidium Iodide (2.5 μL) prepared in 50 μL of Annexin V binding buffer was added per sample and incubated in darkness for 15 min at RT. Unstained, single-stained, and dead cells were used as controls. Flow cytometry data acquisition was performed using a FACSCanto™ II cytometer (BD Biosciences, United States of America), and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software (V10, BD, United States of America).",
        "All mice studies were performed at the Cells for Cells S.A. animal facility following protocols revised and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Universidad de los Andes (approval certificate #CEC2021077). C57BL/6j mice (The Jackson Laboratory; Cat. #000664) were bred and maintained in the same facility. Experiments were carried out using male and female mice aged 8 to 12 weeks, which were randomly assigned to groups according to the experimental design. Mice were housed in cages with ad libitum access to food and water, along with pleated paper and paper cones for environmental enrichment. To ensure animal welfare, a supervision protocol was implemented based on established guidelines [56]. This study complies with the ARRIVE Guidelines for reporting animal research, and a complete ARRIVE checklist is provided in Supplementary Checklist 1. No data was excluded in the analysis of the in vivo studies.",
        "The collagenase-induced OA (CIOA) model was used as previously described [50, 81]. Three groups were established to be compared: (1) Sham (healthy control, no OA induction), (2) OA (CIOA) and (3) sEV (CIOA animals treated with sEV). For OA and sEV groups, one unit of type VII collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum (Sigma-Aldrich, United States of America, Cat. #C2399) in 5 μL PBS 1X was IA administered to the knee joints of C57BL/6j mice on days 0 and 2. Additionally, for the sEV group, on days 7 and 14, the mice of sEV group were subjected to IA injections with 2 × 108 sEV diluted in 5 μL PBS 1X. On day 42, the mice were euthanized, and paws were carefully dissected to remove soft tissues, followed by fixation in 4% PFA (Merck KGaA, Germany, Cat. #1004965000).",
        "Paw samples were analyzed in a μCT SkyScan 1278 (Bruker, United States of America) using the following parameters: 0.5 mm aluminum filter, 59 ± 4 kV, 500 μA, 0.5° rotation and 360° angular range. The specimens were scanned in all spatial planes to obtain 2D and 3D digitalized images using the Nrecon reconstruction software (V1.7.4.2; Bruker, United States of America). Then, standardized regions of interest (ROI) were obtained using the DATAVIEWER analyzer software (V1.5.6.2; Bruker, United States of America). The 2D (bone mineral density) and 3D (surface-to-volume ratio) bone changes in four knee zones (medial femur, lateral femur, medial tibia, and lateral tibia of each paw) were quantified usin the CTan software (V1.18.4.1; Bruker, United States of America). Subsequently, the paws were decalcified through a two-week incubation in a 5% formic acid solution (prepared in distilled water; Merck KGaA, Germany, Cat. #100264) and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. As previously described, tibias were sectioned frontally and stained with safranin O and Fast Green, as described for staining proteoglycans/cartilage and bone, respectively [76]. Cartilage degradation was quantified using a modified Pritzker/Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) score, as previously described [63, 81].",
        "For immunogenic analysis, three groups of mice were established: (1) sham, (2) OA and (3) sEV, as previously mentioned. Mice were IA injected with 5 μL PBS 1X-solution containing ∼2 × 108 particles of UC-MSC-sEV. On day 10 (3 days after IA sEV administration), the popliteal lymph nodes were recovered and mechanically disaggregated. Then, cells were passed through a 40 μm filter (Falcon, United States of America, Cat. #352340) and centrifuged at 1680 rpm for 6 min and cultured for 4 h with Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA, 50 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, United States of America, Cat. #P8139) and ionomycin (1 µg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #I0634) in the presence of 10 μg/mL brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich, United States of America, Cat. #B6542). Subsequently, surface staining was performed using specific antibodies against CD4 (BioLegend, United States of America, Cat. #100422) and CD25 (Biolegend, United States of America, Cat. #102012), followed by fixation and permeabilization using Cytofix/Cytoperm™ (eBioscience, United States of America, Cat. #5523). Finally, intracellular staining for IFN-γ (BD Pharmingen, United States of America, Cat. #554411), IL-17 (BD Pharmingen, United States of America, Cat. #560666) and Foxp3 (eBioscience, United States of America, Cat. #125773–82) was achieved. Final acquisition was performed with a FACSCanto™ II cytometer (BD Biosciences, United States of America), and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software (V10, BD, United States of America).",
        "To evaluate the in vivo biodistribution pattern of sEV therapeutics, mice were IA injected with 5 μL-PBS 1X solution containing ∼2 × 108 particles of freshly purified DiR-stained sEV and non-stained sEV (auto-fluorescence control) (n = 3 per group). At different time points after injection (0, 24, and 48 h), sEV fluorescence intensities were assessed using a LI-COR Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, United States of America) for the entire animal and excised organs according to the manufacturer’s instructions. As control of the sEV staining procedure, DiR was diluted in 100 μL PBS 1X (at a concentration of 71 μM) and then washed using size-exclusion spin columns.",
        "A comparative analysis of miRNAs within the sEV derived from UC-MSC donors was performed. To ensure analytical robustness, a threshold was implemented, wherein miRNAs with a count per million (CPM) greater than 0.5 in at least two out of three samples were considered. The identified miRNAs were subsequently cross-referenced with miRNet and HMDD databases [11, 15]. The target genes associated with the identified sEV-miRNAs were selected and subjected to Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, focusing on biological processes, using the R package GOStats, GOchord, and networkD3 [18].",
        "Concurrently, for protein analysis, proteins present in sEV with at least 2500 LFQ (protein abundance value) in at least two out of the three samples analyzed were considered. The resultant proteins were subjected to Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, specifically focusing on biological processes, using the R package GOStats, GOchord, and networkD3.",
        "To determine the effect of sEV on putative target genes, hmMØs were subjected to the polarization assay described before and RNA was extracted (TRIzol Reagent, Invitrogen, United States of America Cat. #15596026) for reverse transcription assay. Trancript levels of STAT1 were determined by TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems, United States of America, Cat. #4453320; Assay ID: Hs01013996_m1) and transcript levels of PPARγ were determined by qPCR using Brilliant II SYBR Green (Agilent Technologies; Cat. #600828) and the following primers: forward 5′-CCTTGCAGTGGGGATGTCT-3′; reverse 5′-CTCGCCTTTGCTTTGGTCA-3′). Both qPCR were performed in an AriaMx Real-time PCR System (Agilent Technologies).",
        "For product development and process validation studies, three sEV batches were generated and isolated at a smaller scale using a previously described protocol, except for the utilization of either PBS 1X or Ringer Lactate (RL; Baxter, United States of America, Cat. #HRB2323) during the sEV washing step and the final sEV resuspension. Each formulation was evaluated according to the following parameters: particle’s size mode (nm), concentration (particles/mL), identity markers (CD63, CD81, and CD9), and potency assays (via the hmMØs polarization assay), utilizing established protocols, as previously described. The stability assessment of the sEV-based therapeutics was conducted at 5 and 24 months after storage at − 80 °C. This evaluation encompassed sEV batches produced and enriched on a reduced scale by employing RL as the vehicle for formulation.",
        "Short-term stability of sEV products after thawing was conducted at 2–8 °C in previously − 80 °C-stored sEV, which were thawed and maintained at 2–8 °C for 24 h. Both studies employed the same parameters as those previously described for evaluation.",
        "A flowchart of cells and sEV production for clinical use is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1.",
        "All tissue samples were obtained using protocols that were reviewed and approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee of the Universidad de Los Andes (approval certificate #CEC201861). Clinical grade cell manufacturing was carried out as previously described by our group with some modifications [30, 92348]. In brief, UC were obtained from full-term human placentas by cesarean section after signed informed consent from healthy donors following the United States of America (USA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Title 21, Part 1271: Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, Subpart C: Donor Eligibility (§1271.45–1271.90). UC-MSC treatments were manufactured in a facility that complies with GMP in compliance with USA CFR FDA Title 21, part 1271, Subpart D: Current Good Tissue Practice (§1271.145–1271.320) and with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification for the Quality Management System (ISO Standard No. 9001:2015) of the UC-MSC production process at Cells for Cells S.A., Santiago, Chile (www.c4c.cl). All sterility controls were negative to approve the subsequent use of UC-MSC.",
        "UC-MSC were cryopreserved in the third passage (p = 3) until their approval as the master cell bank (MCB) and were subsequently used in the clinic. Cell culture was performed as previously described [20, 30, 9, 48]. The UC-MSC were characterized according to the guidelines of the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy [16]. Immunophenotyping of UC-MSC was performed using a Human MSC Analysis Kit (BD Stemflow™, United Sates of America, Cat. #562245), and dead cells were discarded using Zombie Aqua Dye (BioLegend, United States of America, Cat. #77143). The analysis was performed by flow cytometry using a FACSCanto™ II cytometer. The acquired data were analyzed using the FlowJo software V10. This analysis was performed using MCB cells to approve the lot for clinical use. The trilineage differentiation capacity of cultured UC-MSC was evaluated using the StemPro™ differentiation kits (Gibco, Life Technologies Corp., United States of America) following the manufacturer’s instructions: Adipogenesis Kit (Cat. #A1007001), Chondrogenesis Kit (Cat. #A1007101) and Osteogenesis kit (Cat. #A1007201). After 21 days, cell differentiation into adipocytes was confirmed by Oil Red O staining of lipidic vacuoles (Sigma-Aldrich, United States of America, Cat. #O0625) and osteocyte differentiation was confirmed by calcium deposits detected using Alizarin Red staining (Sigma-Aldrich, United States of America, Cat. #A3757). Chondrogenic differentiation was confirmed after 10 days by Safranin O staining (Sigma-Aldrich, United States of America, Cat. #S2255). Tumorigenic tests of UC-MSC in immunocompromised mice were performed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Cells for Cells S.A. animal facility. After 3 months, organs were collected (skin, liver, lung, brain, and kidney), and histopathological analysis was performed. The previously described results showed the absence of tumors. The genomic stability of the UC-MSC over time was tested by karyotype analysis of cells at p-5 according to the USA CFR FDA Title 21, Part 211: Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals, Section 110: Sampling and testing of in-process materials and drug products (§210.110). Thus, a Batch Approval Certificate (BAC) is generated, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.",
        "UC-MSC approved for clinical use were thawed and seeded in maintenance medium composed of DMEM (Corning, Mediatech Inc., United States of America, Cat. #15-018-CV), supplemented with 1% P/S, 2 mmol/L L-glut and 5% fibrinogen-depleted hPL (manufactured by Cells for Cells S.A., under GMP compliance standard) [20], on a Nunc™ TripleFlask™ at a density of 2000 cells/cm2. After the cells reached confluence, they were expanded and seeded on a 10-layer Nunc™ EasyFill™ Cell Factory™ system. After the cells reached approximately 80% confluence, the maintenance medium was discarded. Cells were washed with PBS 1X (Gibco, Life Technologies Corporation, United States of America, Cat. #10010072) before the addition of the induction medium for sEV production: DMEM supplemented with only 2 mmol/L L-glut. After 2 and 4 days, SN was collected and subjected to serial centrifugation to remove cellular debris and sequential filtrations in 0.45 and 0.22 μm pore-size membrane filtration units (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States of America, Cat. #569-0020 and Cat. #566-0020, respectively), and then, subjected to serial ultracentrifugation (Thermo Electron LED GmbH, model Sorvall WX +) at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C. The pellet obtained was washed once with RL, the supernatant was discarded and sEV were resuspended in the remaining RL, aliquoted, and stored at − 80 °C until use. The sterility of sEV was evaluated using the same protocol described above for the UC-MSC sterility assessment. Each final product of the sEV-based therapeutic for clinical use complied with standardized procedures based on GMP and all quality controls mentioned above.",
        "For the clinical case, the selection of the clinical exploration dose was not established using the conventional allometric scaling method for human-equivalent dose (HED) typically used for small-molecule drugs. This, due to the limitations inherent to the complex manufacturing of an sEV-based product that imposes a limit on the dose of the product that can be produced, thereby restricting the range of doses feasible to administer in a clinical experience. Instead, the IA dose extrapolation for the HED was based on an evaluation of the observed preclinical and clinical efficacy of previous studies performed by our group using the sEV parental cells [47, 48], as well as an assessment of the acceptable safety risk, by the FDA's statement “If available, previous clinical experience with the cellular and gene therapy (CGT) product or related products, even if by a different route of administration or for a different condition, may help to justify the clinical starting dose,” from the “Considerations for the Design of Early-Phase Clinical Trials of Cellular and Gene Therapy Products” guidance [17]. The exploratory dose was calculated based on our published clinical results of IA use of 2 × 106 UC-MSCs in knee OA [47] (NCT No. 03810521) and our own findings indicating a secretion rate of ~ 5.3 × 1010 particles sEV of the same number of cells [20]. Considering the manufacturing feasibility of the sEV-based product, we estimate that a dose of 2 × 1010 ± 0.5 × 1010 total sEV would be required for local administration to the knee.",
        "The cGMP-sEV (2 × 1010 ± 0.5 × 1010 particles) packed into a syringe was kept at 4 °C until IA administration in the patient. The final number of particles was determined using NTA as described above. As a UC-MSC-sEV therapeutic sterility assessment, 11 × 107 particles were used for contamination determination by Aerobic/anaerobic automated blood culture system, and 14 × 107 particles were used for endotoxin determination as described previously. Both control groups were negative for release of the final product. A Certificate of Analysis (CoA) was delivered, indicating that cGMP-sEV-based therapy has the necessary sEV characteristics for release and the minimum sterility requirements for patient administration (Supplementary Fig. 3).",
        "The patient was recruited in October 2021 at the Osteoarthritis Center at the Clínica Universidad de los Andes in Santiago, Chile. Approval was obtained from the Scientific Ethical Committee of the public agency Servicio de Salud Metropolitano Oriente (CECSSMO030821). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. Subject met the following inclusion criteria: age between 30 and 75 years, symptomatic knee OA (defined as daily pain at the affected joint for at least 3 months before inclusion and a visual analog scale equal to or greater than 40 mm), and grade II to III Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic changes. None of the following conditions was retained: meniscal rupture, bilateral symptomatic knee OA, disease of the hip and/or spine, local or systemic infection, any form of secondary arthritis, or previous malignancy. The injection was performed by an orthopedic surgeon at the superior lateral aspect of the patella using a 21-gauge, 1-inch needle. No local anesthetic was used before the puncture. Clinical outcomes (VAS and WOMAC indexes) were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up.",
        "Regarding the imaging procedure, MRI at baseline and 6 months later was analyzed by a blinded radiologist. The patient was studied using a Philips Achieva 3 Tesla MRI scanner, with Smart Knee software to achieve equal knee positioning in pre- and post-treatment resonance imaging. The MRI protocol aims to study articular cartilage volumetry to evaluate the positive changes with treatment and the absence of structural damage to the cartilage. The DICOM files were anonymized and sent electronically to a third party via a secure platform (Image Analysis Group—IAG—, London, UK) for analysis. The external company utilized proprietary software following ISO13485 and the USA CFR FDA Title 21, Part 11: Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures (§11.1–11.300), to perform Quality Controls on, segment, and quantify all MRI images. The images were analyzed by an IAG radiologist and reported to our group.",
        "The clinical investigation will represent a phase I trial focusing on UC-MSC-sEV in patients with symptomatic Kellgren II-III knee OA. The phase I component of the study will be an open-label dose escalation pilot study (NCT No. 06431152; title: “Administration of sEV derived from UC-MSC in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: safety determination in a pilot dose-escalation study”) in which three cohorts of subjects with OA will receive increasing doses of UC-MSC-sEV administered as a single IA injection. Each cohort will comprise four participants. Specifically, patients within the cohorts will be administered the following exploration doses: 2 × 109 particles/3 mL RL ± 0.5 × 109 particles (first cohort-low dose), 6 × 109 particles/3 mL RL ± 0.5 × 109 particles (second cohort-median dose), or 2 × 1010 particles/3 mL RL ± 0.5 × 109 particles (third cohort-high dose). Eligible study subjects will be enrolled at the Clínica Universidad de los Andes. The selection of the study subjects will be performed following the inclusion and exclusion criteria shown in Fig. 8E.",
        "The UC-MSC-sEV will be prepared at the Cells for Cells S.A. GMP facility based at the Clínica Universidad de los Andes. The sEV-based therapeutic for clinical use will be manufactured in compliance with standardized procedures based on GMP regulations and all quality controls aforementioned. The sEV therapeutic will be transported to the patient administration site under controlled conditions, ensuring maintenance of a temperature range between 2–8 °C. The sEV injection is expected to be administered within the first 6 h of product manufacture.",
        "The primary study endpoints of this trial will focus on the safety, feasibility, and toxicity of the sEV-based product. The phase I will examine: (1) the incidence of immediate post-infiltration adverse reactions in patients; (2) the occurrence of synovitis post-infiltration in patients at 24 and 48 h, as well as on days 7 and 15; (3) the frequency of post-infiltration pain reported by patients at 24 and 48 h, and on days 7 and 15; and (4) the prevalence of adverse events related to sEV therapy occurring beyond IA infiltration at 24 and 48 h, and on days 7 and 15, as well as at months 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. The secondary study endpoint will be determine the optimal dose for phase II trials. The criteria that will be considered are: (1) Safety profile at infiltration at 24 and 48 h, and on days 7 and 15, as well as at months 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12; (2) changes in WOMAC scores at months 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12; and (3) alterations in the VAS pain scores at months 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.",
        "All figure legends include n involved. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (V10.2.0; United States of America). For the data normality test, a Shapiro–Wilk test was performed, followed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or unpaired Student’s t-test, depending on the number of groups to be evaluated. For large datasets, outliers were removed using the robust regression and outlier removal (ROUT) method (Q = 1%). For non-parametric data, a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test was performed. For in vivo model, there were no criteria set for including/excluding animals. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant in all cases (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, ns: not significant).",
        "MSC from four UCs were individually enriched and characterized following ISCT recommendations [16] for their subsequent validation and use as sEV-producing parental cells (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thirty-nine batches of purified sEV were obtained under non-cGMP conditions using a protocol established, optimized, and validated in our facility and based on previous studies [2, 20, 69, 94]. Figure 1A illustrates the characterization of the sEV batches according to the MISEV guidelines (size, concentration, identity and purity markers, and morphology) [79, 87]. Specifically, NTA obtained data showed a unimodal size distribution (Fig. 1B), a mean of 149.4 ± 23.98 nm as size mode (Fig. 1C) and a concentration of 1,22 × 1011 ± 7,58 × 1010 particles/mL (Fig. 1D). Bead-based flow cytometry analysis was performed to assess the presence of the tetraspanins CD63, CD81, and CD9, which are considered classical sEV identity markers. The median fluorescence intensity (MeFI) of the gathered data showed the presence of all three markers. However, a hierarchy was identified in the detected MeFI, with CD63 being the most expressed (16.95 ± 12.05 a.u.), followed by CD81 (8.50 ± 5.65 a.u.), and CD9 (4.63 ± 2.78 a.u.) (Fig. 1E. The presence of MSC surface markers CD90 and CD44 was also evaluated to verify the MSC origin of the sEV (MeFI for CD90 = 24.17 ± 18.17 a.u.; MeFI for CD44 = 31.40 ± 36.01 a.u. (Fig. 1F), as well as the presence of HLA A/B/C major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I antigens (MeFI = 2.46 ± 2.14 a.u.) and the absence of HLA DR/DP/DQ MHC-class II antigens (MeFI = 1.15 ± 0.07 a.u.) (Supplementary Fig. 5). Western blot was performed to evaluate Syntenin-1 and Flotillin-1 as complementary identity markers and Calnexin and TOMM20 as sEV purity markers. As expected, the bands confirmed the presence of Syntenin-1 (sEV endosomal origin marker) and Flotillin-1 (sEV membranous component marker) and the absence of Calnexin (endoplasmic reticulum marker) and TOMM20 (mitochondrial marker) (Fig. 1G). TEM allowed the visualization of isolated particles composed of non-agglomerated, cup-shaped vesicles, with a size and morphology compatible with sEV (Fig. 1H). These data confirm the extracellular vesicle and exosome nature of UC-MSC's secreted particles. These findings further confirm that sEV batches, purified according to our established protocol, align with MISEV guidelines, ensuring size, identity, and purity criteria and establishing their MSC origin.Fig. 1 UC-MSC secretes sEV with unique and reproducible molecular cargo.

        "Approximately 1604 distinct miRNAs were identified among sEV samples (1278 in sample sEVdonor 1, 1194 in sample sEVdonor 2, 1218 in sample sEVdonor 3, and 1220 in a biological replicate sample of sEV from donor 3) (Table S1). Notably, 904 miRNAs were shared among the sEV samples derived from three UC-MSC donors (Fig. 1I), indicating that they were commonly expressed in our purified sEV. Interestingly, the number of reads obtained for each miRNA detected showed that only 13 miRNAs represented ~ 70% of the total reads processed for each batch of sEV analyzed (Fig. 1J), which confirmed the feasibility of obtaining sEV with a specific and reproducible miRNA signature. In the proteomic analysis of sEV, a total of 420 distinct proteins were identified among the samples (392 in sample sEVdonor 1, 386 in sample sEVdonor 2, and 252 in sample sEVdonor 3) (Table S2), of which 236 proteins were shared between the three sEV samples (Fig. 1K). Of these proteins, 70 corresponded to proteins expected to be found in sEV isolates (Supplementary Fig. 6) [79, 87], confirming the EV and exosome nature of our UC-MSC-derived isolates. Taken together, these results suggest that despite variations in miRNA and protein compositions between sEV samples, a core set of miRNAs and proteins that are consistently present in UC-MSC-derived sEV exists. This implies a high standardization and reproducibility level in manufacturing, emphasizing the potential of producing sEV with specific molecular signatures suitable for therapeutic applications.",
        "In huOAC, flow cytometry analysis data showed progressive uptake and accumulation of sEV over a 24 h time (Supplementary Figs. 7A and B), confirming its intracellular location through confocal microscopy (Fig. 2A). Similarly, internalization of sEV was also observed in synoviocytes and macrophages (Fig. 2B and C, respectively). To confirm the delivery of sEV cargo, a proof-of-concept experiment using engineered sEV loaded with a synthetic miRNA (cel-39) derived from Caenorhabditis elegans was performed on chondrocytes, synoviocytes and macrophages. Characterization of the engineered sEV demonstrated that the loading protocol via electroporation maintained vesicle size, quantity, integrity, and identity (Supplementary Fig. 8) and morphology (Fig. 2D). qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the successful loading of sEV with exogenous cel-miRNA-39 (Fig. 2E). Incubation of engineered sEV with chondrocytes, synoviocytes and macrophages revealed effective transfer of cel-miRNA-39 via direct internalization (Fig. 2F). Altogether, these results confirm that sEV can be taken up by various cell types present within the joint microenvironment and can deliver their molecular cargo to recipient cells. This underscores the potential therapeutic impact of targeted content delivery.Fig. 2sEV are internalized by key OA-related cell lineages and can be engineered to carry and deliver and external miRNA.

        "To investigate whether sEV-based treatment acts as a specific stimulus to hmMØs to predominantly adopt an M2-like phenotype (anti-inflammatory state), a hmMØs polarization assay was established and analyzed by flow cytometry and ELISA (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, sEV treatment decreases the expression of HLA-DR (fold change of 0.56 ± 0.13 respect to control) and CD86 (fold change of 0.82 ± 0.28 respect to control) and increases the expression of CD206 (fold change of 1.55 ± 0.54 respect to control) and CD163 (fold change of 1.25 ± 0.18 respect to control), suggesting the acquisition of an anti-inflammatory M2-like state. Due to M2-like macrophages exhibit significant phenotypic heterogeneity and can be subdivided into various subtypes: M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d, each expressing specific markers, exhibiting unique cytokine profile, and performing varied function [72], a comprehensive study was conducted to assess diverse pro- and anti-inflammatory secreted cytokines. Figure 3C shows that the treatment with UC-MSC-sEV stimulate the secretion of IL-10 (control = 81.33 ± 20.42 pg/mL; sEV = 4149 ± 1561 pg/mL), VEGF (control = undetectable; sEV = 277 ± 114 pg/mL), IL-6 (control = 143.0 ± 243.2 pg/mL; sEV = 2250 ± 93.89 pg/mL), and TNF-α (control = undetectable; sEV = 471.0 ± 177.6 pg/mL). An increasing trend was also observed for IL-1β (control = 6.59 ± 11.43 pg/mL; sEV = 108.0 ± 69.32 pg/mL). This ambivalent secretory profile of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, along with the expression of CD86, suggests an increment of the polarization to an M2b-like subset [85]. Interestingly, this biological effect was consistent across various monocyte donors and sEV batches (Supplementary Fig. 9). Altogether, the data obtained demonstrate that UC-MSC-sEV treatment triggers an anti-inflammatory state in hmMØs, presenting the potential to contribute to the repair of damaged articular cartilage.Fig. 3 sEV drives macrophage polarization and exerts chondroprotective activity against oxidative stress.

        "To study the chondroprotective activity of UC-MSC-sEV against oxidative stress, huOAC cells exposed to menadione—an agent known to induce cell death via ROS-dependent mechanisms  [45]—were treated with UC-MSC-sEV (Fig. 3E). As shown in Figs. 3F and G, while menadione induced cell death in 80.61 ± 11.47% of cells, treatment with sEV mitigated this effect, diminishing cell death to 57.21 ± 18.69%, demonstrating the chondroprotective activity of sEV against oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and their potential to mitigate OA progression.",
        "To investigate the safety of the sEV-based treatment in vitro, cytotoxicity based on the measurement of the cytoplasmic enzyme LDH was performed in huOAC cells after treatment with UC-MSC-sEV (Fig. 3H). LDH detection in the SN indicates plasma membrane damage, a characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis, necrosis, and other forms of cellular damage [38]. The LDH release-based assay showed that sEV treatment did not elicit any alterations in LDH release into the extracellular milieu of huOAC cells (Fig. 3I). This safety assessment indicated the absence of potential cytotoxic effects on primary cells forming hyaline cartilage, demonstrating a favorable biocompatibility profile for the administration of sEV into the joint.",
        "To elucidate the mechanism through which UC-MSC-sEV exert an anti-inflammatory effect on hmMØs, bioinformatics analysis was carried out to integrate data from miRNA profiles and proteomics to analyze interconnected biological networks. Among the ~ 1200 miRNAs identified in each sEV sample, close to 45% (corresponding to 516 miRNAs) exhibited sequence homology with entries in the online miRNET database [11]. Subsequently, by cross-referencing these 516 miRNAs with the HMDD database, a repository for experimentally supported human miRNA-disease associations [15], a subset of 16 common miRNAs was identified (Fig. 4A). The characterization of these 16 identified miRNAs revealed different expression patterns, highlighting the enriched levels of miR-320a, miR-107, miR-320c and miR-137 (Fig. 4B), due to the high number of targets (Table S3). Importantly, all 16 miRNAs were associated with processes implicated in OA (Table S4), emphasizing their potential relevance in this context. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of the targets of the selected miRNAs were conducted to identify the pathways related specifically to macrophages or inflammation that contribute to the anti-inflammatory mechanism. Biological processes, such as “macrophage differentiation”, “macrophages derived from cell differentiation”, “regulation of macrophage cytokine production”, and “macrophage cytokine production” were the terms with more genes associated with the pathway related to “macrophages” (Fig. 4C). In the GO category “inflammation”, the main terms identified were “inflammatory cell apoptotic process” and “inflammatory response to wounding” (Fig. 4D). The association between these miRNAs and their respective protein-coding gene targets within pathways is shown in Fig. 4E for macrophage-related processes and Fig. 4F for inflammation related processes, in which miRNA-107 and miRNA-320a stood out with the highest number of targets in these contexts. Of predicted target genes, highlight Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1 (PARP1), among others, since at least two miRNAs shared them and, notably, were previously reported to be involved in the complex process of macrophage polarization (Table S5). Through the list of detected miRNAs, miRNA-222, miRNA-27a and miRNA-125a-5p were identified in all sEV batches. These miRNAs have been associated previously to play a crucial role into M2b-like polarization of macrophages [85]. In particular, miRNA-222 up-regulation polarizes monocytes to M2b-like macrophages [78], miRNA27-a is increased in M2b-like macrophages [25], and miRNA-125a-5p overexpression enhances M2b polarization [5]. This underscores their potential influence on key processes associated with macrophages and inflammation, suggesting a crucial role in the molecular landscape of OA. The full dataset is presented in Table S6.Fig. 4The deciphered molecular signature of sEV provides insights of their inflammation-related bioactivity in silico.

        "Regarding the proteins identified in the sEV cargo, the GO analysis revealed significant enrichment in “macrophage migration,” “regulation of macrophage migration,” and “inflammatory response” in the biological process category. Notably, CD81, Apolipoprotein B (APOB), Integrin alpha V (ITGAV), and Integrin-β3 (ITGB3) were highly enriched in the macrophage-related processes (Fig. 4G). In addition, complement component 3 (C3), CD81, Serpin family E member (SERPINE1), and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) were implicated in inflammation (Fig. 4H). Interestingly, SERPINE1 and A2M have been reported to be involved in binding pro-inflammatory molecules, promoting the M2-like phenotype, and attenuating cartilage degeneration and bone resorption in preclinical OA models via distinct signaling pathways [37, 54, 9983,]. These findings underscore the potential significance of these molecules in macrophage-related and inflammatory processes and offer valuable insights into their roles within the intricate molecular network associated with OA. The complete dataset is presented in Table S7.",
        "In order to confirm the in silico predictions related to the role of sEV’s miRNA and protein cargo in regulating macrophage polarization and inflammation, RT-qPCR analysis was conducted to measure the transcript levels for Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) and Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARγ) in hmMØs treated with sEV for 24 h. The results showed a decrease in STAT1 transcript levels (Fig. 4I, left), supporting the modulatory effect of sEV on macrophage polarization. A decrease was also observed in PPARγ transcript levels (Supplementary Fig. 10). Control macrophages treated with IFNγ/LPS (M1 phenotype) exhibited an expected increase in STAT1 transcript levels [34] and a decrease in PPARγ [93].These findings confirm the capacity of sEV to shift macrophage profiles towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. A summary schematic is presented (Fig. 4I, right).",
        "On days 7 and 14 post OA induction, 2 × 108 particles were injected via IA (Fig. 5A). This concentration was established considering the highest number of particles attainable within a 5 μL solution, corresponding to the maximum volume feasible for administration into a mouse knee joint [36, 74]. At 42 days post-OA induction, the mouse articular cartilage was subjected to histomorphometric and histopathological studies. Representative images obtained by μCT are shown in Figs. 5B and D to assess the bone architecture of the joint. μCT involves recording 2D X-ray images from various viewing angles around the freely rotating sample, which is followed by a 3D reconstruction generated by computer algorithms [62]. The 2D parameter corresponded to bone mineral density (BMD), which was employed to quantify the mineral total mass normalized by the volume of the analyzed zone, providing an estimate of bone integrity [26, 52]. μCT analysis revealed decreased BMD in the lateral femur (0.001977 ± 0.0002000) as well as in the medial and lateral tibia (0.002362 ± 0.0003302 and 0.001915 ± 0.0002477, respectively) joint areas of animals treated with sEV compared to the vehicle-treated group (0.002370 ± 0.0003670, 0.002858 ± 0.0004405, and 0.002214 ± 0.0003149, respectively), with values approaching those of the sham group (0.001929 ± 0.0005558, 0.002015 ± 0.0007867 and 0.001645 ± 0.0004973, respectively) (Fig. 5C). Regarding the 3D parameters, the bone surface-to-volume ratio (BS/BV) was assessed, a value that indicates the ratio between the surface area and volume of the region segmented as bone, providing a measure of the number of bone-lining cells covering a given volume of bone in the sample [52, 61]. The BS/BV analysis exhibited a drastic reduction in sEV-treated animals in all joint areas analyzed (medial femur = 9.158 ± 1.777,lateral femur = 9.755 ± 1.478; medial tibia = 8.309 ± 1.492; and lateral tibia 9.651 ± 1.136 with respect to vehicle-treated (medial femur = 11.82 ± 2.071; lateral femur = 12.22 ± 1.337; medial tibia = 10.56 ± 1.492; and lateral tibia = 13.04 ± 1.655 and sham groups (medial femur = 11.29 ± 4.373; lateral femur = 10.44 ± 3.224; medial tibia = 10.32 ± 3.325; lateral tibia = 11.26 ± 4.553 (Fig. 4E).Fig. 5 sEV reduces the severity of osteoarthritis and promotes regeneration in a murine model in vivo.

        "Histological analysis revealed signs of joint regeneration in animals treated with sEV. Figure 5F displays representative images of each experimental group, where the articular cartilage layer is observed in red owing to the staining process. Although animals with OA displayed architectural loss and cartilage degradation, these findings were absent in the sEV-treated group. These results indicate that sEV-based therapeutic shields cartilage and bone from degradation in the CIOA murine model. Histologically, the severity of cartilage damage and the affected surface area were evaluated using the Pritzker OARSI score, which considers the degree of degeneration and depth of damage [57]. The clinical score obtained showcased low values in the articular regions of the medial femur, lateral femur, medial tibia, and lateral tibia in sEV-treated animals (10.59 ± 3.062, 9.094 ± 2.782, 10.53 ± 5.786, and 10.86 ± 4.924, respectively), akin to those in the sham control groups (3.971 ± 2.440, 4.059 ± 2.947, 3.529 ± 1.875, and 4.531 ± 2.101, respectively), and lower than the values obtained in vehicle-treated mice (18.37 ± 10.50, 19.97 ± 10.27, 17.27 ± 12.60, and 26.72 ± 3.256) (Fig. 5G). These results demonstrated that sEV-based therapy has regenerative and protective therapeutic potential for hyaline cartilage in a murine model of OA, which must be confirmed in patients.",
        "To assess the potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of sEV, we investigated the immune cell populations within the proximal popliteal lymph nodes following IA administration of sEV. After three days of IA sEV administration, the mice were humanely euthanized, and the drained lymph nodes were harvested for subsequent flow cytometry analysis. Our findings revealed that IA administration of sEV tended to decrease the proportions of CD4+IL-17+ cells, predominantly composed of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells, and significantly inhibits the population of CD4+IFN-γ+ cells, predominantly characterized by pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine-producing cells, as compared to the OA control by two-fold and thee-fold, respectively. In the case of CD25+FOXP3+ cells (T-reg cells), sEV IA administration tended to increase their percentage by a quarter (Fig. 6A). This observation suggests an immunosuppressive activity exhibited by sEV derived from UC-MSCs, which is consistent with the previously observed immunomodulatory effects in in vitro assays and predicted by in silico assays based on the miRNA and proteomic cargo of sEV.Fig. 6 sEV exerts immunosuppresive activity in vivo and are maintained within the knee joint space. A For murine in  vivo immunogenicity assessment popliteal lymph nodes were isolated from sham, OA and sEV treated mice and T-CD4+ cell populations were determined by flow cytometry as follows: CD4+IL-17+ for proinflammatory cells; CD4+IFNy+ for helper cells and CD25+FOXP3+ for Treg cells. Representative histograms for each subpopulation are shown (left) and subpopulations percentages are presented (right).

        "To investigate the biodistribution kinetics of the sEV-based product following IA injection in vivo, healthy mice were administered a single injection of therapeutic doses (2 × 108 particles/knee). In vivo scans conducted at 24, 48, and 72 h post-injection revealed the presence of DiR-stained sEV in the knee joint. As shown in Fig. 6B, the signal from DiR-stained sEV remained localized within the knees of the animals for up to 72 h. Ex vivo organ analysis was performed to evaluate the possible migration of sEV from the joint to other organs of the mouse body without detecting any signal from the DiR-stained sEV in the examined organs (Supplementary Fig. 11). These data indicate the retention of sEV at the administration site without significant migration to other organs during the study period, implying a favorable safety profile for IA administration of sEV.",
        "To translate the preclinical product into a formulation suitable for clinical use, it was necessary to substitute the carrier solution utilized in the preclinical product (PBS) with a solution that adhered to the standards required for therapeutic administration, such as RL solution. The homologation study of the generated sEV-based products was performed according to the MISEV recommendations to characterize sEV and evaluate their potency in the hmMØs polarization assay. Details are given in Appendix 1 and Supplementary Fig. 12. The findings demonstrated that sEV suspended in RL showed similar results to those suspended in PBS in terms of size, concentration, morphology, integrity, identity, purity, and potency. This highlights the suitability of RL as a vehicle for sEV suspensions and suggests its potential clinical applicability.",
        "To evaluate the stability of the sEV-based product under relevant storage conditions, sEV batches produced and enriched at a reduced scale were stored at − 80 °C for periods of 5 and 24 months. The results indicated no notable differences in the size mode, concentration, and presence of identity markers after storage for 5 months (Supplementary Fig. 13). Regarding the long-term stability testing, the NTA analysis revealed minimal change in particle size (from 149.5 ± 15.18 nm to 161.1 ± 5.773 nm) along with a decrease to one third of particle concentration (time 0 = 3.26 × 1011 ± 2.14 × 1011 particles/mL; time 24 month = 1.17 × 1011 ± 4.63 × 1010 particles/mL) (Fig. 7A). Concerning the expression of canonical markers in sEV, the MeFI values suggested that storage for 24 months did not induce alterations in tetraspanins expression (Fig. 7B), maintaining the previously observed hierarchy: CD63 > CD81 > CD9. The assessment of sEV potency 24 months post-storage was also tested using the hmMØs polarization assay. The therapeutic sEV-based product retained its potential to induce an anti-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages, exhibiting an M2b-like polarization effect. This significant finding was characterized by reduced expression changes of HLA-DR and CD86, along with increased expression of CD206 and CD163 (Fig. 7C) and an increase in IL-10 (control = 78.88 ± 0.00 pg/mL; sEV = 149.8 ± 97.19 pg/mL), IL-6 (control = 17.64 ± 0.00 pg/mL; sEV = 547.3 ± 777.2 pg/mL), and TNF-α (control = not detected; sEV = 11.54 ± 14.24 pg/mL) secretion (Fig. 7D). This biological effect was consistent across the different monocyte donors (Supplementary Fig. 14). These results demonstrate that even after 24 months of storage, the vesicles maintained their identity and functional characteristics linked to anti-inflammatory properties despite the reduction in particle concentration.Fig. 7  sEV phenotype and activity is stable after prolonged storage and thawing.

        "To validate the suitable timeframe between thawing and administration of the sEV product, a short shelf-life study was carried out using the thawed sEV maintained in the temperature range of 2–8 °C. This temperature range was investigated because of its optimal suitability for logistics, transportation, and storage of products within facilities where this therapeutic approach can be applied. As shown in Fig. 7E, both the particle modal size and the concentration of the formulation remained stable at 24 h (size: 130.6 ± 11.7 nm; concentration: 2.34 × 1011 ± 1.14 × 1011) compared to the initial time point (size: 119.2 ± 1.2 nm; concentration: 2.96 × 1011 ± 1.70 × 1011). Regarding the identity markers, the MeFI values revealed that the expression of the tetraspanins remained consistent at 24 h (CD63 = 36.9 ± 0.5; CD81 = 8.1 ± 1.6; CD9 = 6.9 ± 0.8) compared to the basal time (CD63 = 28.7 ± 1.3; CD81 = 7.3 ± 1.9; CD9 = 5.6 ± 0.9) (Fig. 7F). Potency assays showed that 24 h storage does not alter the capacity of the sEV product to drive hmMØs towards the M2b state. Flow cytometry showed the increased expression of CD206 and CD163 along with reduced expression changes of HLA-DR and CD86, as shown in Fig. 7G. Likewise, cytokine quantification demonstrated an increased secretion compared to control macrophages of IL-10 (control = 132.4 ± 34.94 pg/mL; sEV = 842.2 ± 215.5 pg/mL), VEGF (control = 11.57 ± 10.15 pg/mL; sEV = 107.3 ± 33.97 pg/mL), IL-6 (control = not detected; sEV = 2,523 ± 1,541 pg/mL), TNF-α (control = not detected; sEV = 142.9 ± 87.24 pg/mL) and IL-1β (control = not detected; sEV = 20.16 ± 14.10 pg/mL) (Fig. 7H). Collectively, these data show that thawed sEV therapeutics remain stable for 24 h at temperatures ranging from 2 °C to 8 °C. During this period, no significant alterations in size, concentration, specific protein markers, or potency were observed. Consequently, storing sEV within this temperature range could be an optimal storage condition.",
        "A 56 year-old woman with symptomatic knee OA was recruited for the IA injection of sEV. Owing to her professional occupation, she spent most of the day on her feet. Initial assessment revealed a pain-centric clinical presentation, with a limited gait range of 40 m and Kellgren-Lawrence stage II OA evident on radiography. She had no history of infiltration, arthroscopy, or surgery of the affected joint. Clinical examination indicated the absence of deformity, effusion, and preserved joint range, along with a positive patellar grinding test and negative Apley compression test. The body mass index was 30.2 kg/m2.",
        "Patient-infiltrated therapy was subjected to strict quality controls at critical stages of the manufacturing process for its approval for clinical use, including its characterization by immunophenotyping for CD63, CD81, and CD9 markers. Syntenin-1, Flotillin-1 and Calnexin were not detected by WB. Sterility was verified by automated aerobic/anaerobic blood culture testing, mycoplasma and endotoxin tests, and all tests were negative.",
        "The patient’s baseline visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 60 mm, and her Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index was 79.6 (pain = 13, stiffness = 5, function = 61.6). After six months, the VAS and WOMAC indices were markedly reduced to 0 mm and 2 (pain = 0, stiffness = 0, function = 2), respectively. At 12 months, a sustained response was evident, with a VAS score of 0 mm and WOMAC index of 23 (pain = 3, stiffness = 2, function = 18) (Fig. 8A), allowing the patient to complete an unrestricted 200 m walk. Safety assessments revealed only transient post-injection pain, which was managed with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and no joint effusion. No local or systemic symptoms or diseases were recorded during the 1 year follow-up. MRI images of the patients’ knees at baseline and six months (Fig. 8B) were analyzed by Image Analysis Group (IAG; a third party based in London, UK). Following QC using IAG’s proprietary technology and processes, the volumetric sequences SAG 3D SPAIR and SAG 3D WATSc were selected to study the progression of cartilage damage. Quantitative volumetry obtained via artificial segmentation of the femoral cartilage showed consistent hyaline cartilage volume pre- and post-treatment in both SAG 3D SPAIR and SAG 3D WATSc sequences, with no sign of degradation (Fig. 8C).Fig. 8First-in-human sEV administration over time and phase I clinical study design.

        "In phase I, three cohorts are planned with four subjects in each cohort receiving a three-fold escalating dose of 2 × 109 ± 0.5 × 109 total particles, 6 × 109 ± 0.5 × 109 total particles, or 2 × 1010 ± 0.5 × 1010 total particles. These exploration doses will seek to determine the optimal dose to advance to phase II. Due to the characteristics of the sEV-based product and its manufacturing considerations, the exploration dose in the clinical case (2 × 1010 ± 0.5 × 1010 total particles) was established as the maximum tolerable dose feasible to investigate in the early-phase clinical trial. The medium and low doses correspond to a reduction of three-fold each, an escalated dose magnitude recommended by the FDA in its guidance for the design of early clinical trials using cellular products 17.",
        "For the phase I, controlled, prospective, non-comparative clinical trial using a defined dose-escalation protocol of UC-MSC-sEV for the treatment of knee OA, the incidence of both serious and non-serious adverse events directly attributed to- or resulting from the sEV infusion will be reported. This evaluation will extend from the early post-infusion period through 12 months of follow-up. The analysis of the primary safety endpoint will focus on the characterization of the proportion of adverse events in each treatment arm, while the secondary endpoint will be used for the design of the phase II trials. The analysis of the change in the WOMAC and VAS scores will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the product based on sEV in a small sample size. Analysis of the frequency of adverse events along with overall assessment of potential efficacy using clinical endpoints will allow us to determine safety and whether to proceed with a phase II trial. The study design flow is summarized in Fig. 8D.",
        "The clinical use of cell-derived biologics such as sEV encompasses different modalities, and their manufacturing processes may be vastly different from those of other therapeutics. Although identifying appropriate preclinical in vivo models to study the potential of sEV-based therapeutics can be challenging, the findings of this study, based on a well-established CIOA animal model, underscore the potential of UC-MSC-derived sEV as a novel therapeutic avenue to address the complexities of OA. The success of the early development of novel therapeutics is heavily dependent on robust findings and complete preclinical data focusing not only on function, safety, and efficacy, but also on manufacturing, quality control, scaling, stability, and storage cues. Hence, issues related to pharmaceutical categorization are essential, and the regulatory aspects of the manufacturing and application of new therapeutics must be vigorously implemented [40]. A unified framework from early phase development to the commercialization of sEV-based drug products is still in progress. Nonetheless, we provide substantial advances in establishing a robust framework, beginning with the development of a sEV-based therapy, demonstrating consistent production, reproducible batches, and confirming the safety of clinical-grade products via initial human trials. The outcomes of our preclinical studies are consistent with those of prior research highlighting the regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties of MSC-sEV in mitigating joint degeneration, especially in the context of osteoarthritis [8, 13, 60, 70].",
        "In our previous controlled randomized phase I/II trials, we described the safety and anti-inflammatory effect of IA injection of UC-derived MSC, the parental cells used to produce sEV. We also identified optimal dose and number of injections required to achieve clinical efficacy in patients with OA [47, 48]. The demonstration of the safety and clinical efficacy of the parental cells is relevant for de-risking the use of UC-MSC-derived sEV, but it cannot be fully extrapolated to the sEV product, and similar studies need to be performed. In this study, detailed characterization of UC-MSC-derived sEV under non-cGMP conditions underscores their potential as a therapeutic option for OA. The manufacturing protocol follows a designed workflow adhering to the stringent guidelines of the USA CFR FDA Title 21, Part 211: Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals (§211.1–211.208), from tissue procurement to final product packaging, validating the identity and purity, and ensuring reproducible production of the isolated UC-MSC-sEV. Comprehensive analyses, including morphology, size, and protein marker assessments, confirmed the small extracellular vesicle classification [87]. Notably, a specific expression pattern of transmembrane tetraspanins was identified in all the sEV batches, with a consistent hierarchy of CD63 > CD81 > CD9. Syntenin-1 expression in sEV products has also been detected, providing evidence to support an endosomal biogenesis pathway for these extracellular vesicles [4]. The presence of MSC surface antigens CD90 and CD44 [16], was confirmed in the sEV products, indicating their MSC cellular origin [89]. The reduced MHC class I expression and absence of MHC class II in sEV products suggests a potential immune privilege that limits recognition by cytotoxic T cells and minimizes immune response risks [66, 71]. This characteristic, which is expected due to the parental cell origin [7], enhances the safety profile of allogeneic sEV-based therapies. The molecular cargo profile revealed a consistent shared repertoire of miRNAs and proteins, indicating the degree of standardization of the manufacturing process. Despite the inherent variability between samples, identification of a core molecular signature suggests the practicality of obtaining sEV with reproducible and specific compositions. The established reproducibility and consistency of the molecular cargo of sEV are clear advances that promote confidence in translating preclinical developments into clinically relevant therapeutic interventions. While some studies have suggested that EV-borne miRNAs do not act as effectors of cell-to-cell communication [1], future research should delve into elucidating the specific contribution of this core molecular signature to the observed therapeutic effects in OA, paving the way for a better understanding of the treatment’s MoA.",
        "Although the therapeutic impact of sEV may not depend exclusively on the internalization and transfer of their molecular cargo, evidence in literature underlines the pivotal role of these mechanisms in achieving therapeutic actions 49. In this study, the internalization of sEVs in key cells for the regulation of OA progression, such as chondrocytes, synoviocytes, and macrophages, was evaluated [29, 28, 73, 90]. The internalization assay confirmed the intracellular presence of sEV in these cells, confirming their potential as acceptors for the therapeutic effects mediated by sEV. A proof-of-concept experiment demonstrated a miRNA cargo shuttle in chondrocytes, synoviocytes and macrophages, emphasizing the specificity and potential therapeutic impact of sEV-mediated content delivery within diverse cell types constituting the OA joint microenvironment.",
        "In OA pathology, inflammation and oxidative stress are closely integrated during disease progression, with elevated inflammatory mediators contributing to joint tissue abnormalities [46]. Local inflammatory responses, spearheaded by resident macrophages with a predominant pro-inflammatory phenotype [35], increase oxidative stress and accumulate ROS [46]. This alters cellular homeostasis in the joint, affecting cartilage metabolism and the viability of its cellular components, while perpetuating the inflammatory cascade [58]. Regulating the cellular redox balance and reducing the prevalence of pro-inflammatory macrophages within the joint are pivotal considerations for mitigating the severity of OA, as previously described [41, 43, 82]. In this context, our in vitro data showed that sEV treatment triggered the polarization of naïve (M0) macrophages into an M2b-like phenotype by targeting critical transcriptions factors involved in macrophage polarization and protected hOAC from ROS-induced apoptosis. M2b macrophages, also known as regulatory macrophages, are characterized by the expression of CD86 and various pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β, and elicit significant expression and secretion of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine [85]. Our findings suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying this polarization may involve the modulation of STAT1. By downregulating STAT1 expression, sEV facilitate a shift towards a macrophage profile that supports resolution of inflammation and tissue repair, processes that are essential for protecting chondrocytes and maintaining joint homeostasis in OA. The acquisition of an M2b phenotype is crucial for resolving inflammation in the OA joint, since these cells significantly suppress the immune response, impede naïve macrophage polarization into an M1-like state, and resist repolarization into M1-like macrophages [10]. This would contribute to reducing extracellular inflammatory proteins and simultaneously protecting chondrocytes from ROS-induced apoptosis and establishing a healthy microenvironment. These findings are consistent with previously reported results for other experimental MSC-sEV therapies, where an anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages was also observed [42, 9755]). At the clinical level, the M1/M2 macrophage ratio has been significantly associated with the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system in knee OA, indicating that it is a potential predictor of OA severity [43, 101]. The immunomodulatory effects on macrophage reprogramming shown here, might additionally, represent the MoA by which sEV can skew the inflammatory microenvironment towards a pro-chondrogenic status, leading directly to a decrease in pain and stiffness scales in patients. Investigating the potential of UC-MSC-sEV products to repolarize M1-like macrophages into the M2b-like state and validating their biological impact on synovial macrophages will be investigated in future studies.",
        "By performing in silico analysis, we identified at the molecular level that miRNAs and proteins transported by sEV may be involved in orchestrating molecular events, particularly related macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses. Using various bioinformatic tools, the analysis revealed 16 miRNAs with distinct functionalities related to OA and immunological processes, as documented in several studies. miRNA-107 has been identified for its protective role against knee OA, which is characterized by the reduction of caspase-1 activity and the inhibition of IL-1β [64]. Furthermore, circulating miRNA-320a has been linked to the promotion of an M2-like immunosuppressive phenotype, suggesting its possible involvement in the regulation of inflammation [21]. In addition, miRNA-222-3p, miRNA-27a and miRNA-125a-5p were detected in all sEV batches. These miRNAs have been associated to play a crucial role into M2b-like polarization of macrophages [85]. In line with these findings, we validated STAT1 and PPARγ as potential miRNA target genes in macrophages, which was also associated with an increase in IL-10 production in macrophages exposed to sEV. The above findings allow us to better understand the molecular mechanisms that may be modulated by UC-MSC-sEV and potentially intervene in the inflammatory processes associated with OA using sEV enriched in specific molecular components to further improve their impact on immunological processes.",
        "The efficacy of UC-MSC-sEV treatment was demonstrated in the CIOA murine model, where μCT analysis revealed reduced BMD and BS/BV in sEV-treated animals, indicating a protective effect on joint integrity. Notably, histological assessment showed signs of joint regeneration, confirming the role of sEV in protecting cartilage and bone from degradation. The Pritzker OARSI score also indicated the regenerative potential of sEV therapy for hyaline cartilage. Additionally, immune cell analysis revealed an anti-inflammatory effect, reducing the number of pro-inflammatory Th17 and Th1 cytokine-producing cells after sEV administration. Previous studies using UC-MSC-sEV-based therapies reported outcomes similar to those observed in this study [102]. For example, the study conducted by Li et al. [42] indicates that UC-MSC-sEV can alleviate cartilage degradation in OA by delivering key proteins and modulating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway through miRNAs, promoting M2-like macrophage polarization, and exhibiting potent immunomodulatory potential. Likewise, Zhou et al. [100] report that UC-MSC-sEV treatment inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors in macrophages, prevents cartilage extracellular matrix degradation, enhances chondrocyte proliferation and migration, and inhibits chondrocyte apoptosis.",
        "With respect to the biodistribution studies, the data indicates that sEV remain localized in the joint space for at least 72 h. This result reinforces the safety profile for IA administration due to the absence of leakage of sEV to other organs. Coupled with the expression profile of MHC class I and II in sEV and the absence of cytotoxicity observed in huOAC after different treatment doses in vitro, these results collectively confirmed the safety profile of the therapy in non-clinical safety studies. The choice of local delivery through IA administration provides an advantage by ensuring higher concentrations of sEV to the site of injury and increasing their uptake by target cells, particularly those within the knee joint space, while limiting off-target effects and the necessity of high and repetitive dosing.",
        "After establishing the efficacy and safety profile in preclinical settings, the development of the UC-MSC-sEV product began with GMP homologation and validation to meet regulatory requirements and ensure the safety and quality of treatment. The product demonstrated consistency in size, concentration, and identity after modification of its formulation (RL as the vehicle). Notably, the sEV-based product retained its potency, defined as its ability to induce an anti-inflammatory state in naïve macrophages. After rigorous evaluation of its stability, the functionality of the product during long-term storage and within a defined shelf life was evident, further validating the potential of UC-MSC-sEV as a viable and robust therapeutic option for clinical translation.",
        "The safety profile and promising impact of sEV-based therapy was evident in a 56 year-old woman with knee OA which highlights the potential therapeutic activity of sEV for OA treatment. Following IA administration, the patient showed notable and long-lasting improvement in pain and disability. Clinical assessments, including VAS and WOMAC index scores, showed substantial improvements at 6 months and persisted at the 12 month follow-up. The patient's unrestricted completion of a 200 m walk further denotes the potential therapeutic efficacy of sEV in managing knee OA symptoms. Safety analysis revealed only transient pain post-injection, well managed with medication, with no recorded adverse events during the 1 year follow-up, indicating a favorable safety profile. Imaging assessments using a third party’s proprietary image analysis software indicated the absence of degenerative cartilage damage progression post-sEV treatment, suggesting that sEV intervention did not harm the joint structure. Moreover, the consistent values of femoral cartilage volume shown by the UK-based imaging company suggested that sEV therapy “may halt cartilage reduction”. The increase of WOMAC index scores at one year is expected as sequential dosing might be needed. The frequency and dose responses will be addressed in sequentially planed clinical phases following the analysis of findings from the upcoming phase I clinical trial.",
        "The design of the phase I clinical trial was based on a wealth of knowledge, integrating insights from diverse sources. Our prior clinical experience with OA therapy using UC-MSCs [47, 48] provided a foundational understanding. This experience, coupled with considerations of joint size and anatomy in mice and humans, informed by preclinical dosage data obtained from the murine OA model were pivotal for the dosing approach. Real world evidence and insights gleaned from Dr. Rohde's group regarding the local intracochlear clinical application of sEV [86], was also taken into consideration in defining the dose-escalation protocol. The manufacturing feasibility of the sEV-based product were also examined, further influencing the design of the protocol. This was particularly pertinent as the concentration of sEV that can be locally administered in the knee joint is strongly determined by the maximum volume of product that can be delivered into this joint (1–3 mL maximum volume according to information obtained directly from surveyed orthopedic surgeons). The manufacturing capacity also influenced the trial design and size of the cohorts, as cautioned in the FDA guidance “Considerations for the design of early-phase clinical trials of cellular and gene therapy products” [17]. This collective knowledge guided the development of the submitted dose-escalation protocol.",
        "Given the influence of manufacturing processes on the clinical application of sEV, the impact of manufacturing processes on the clinical application of sEV cannot be overstated. As we advance safety and clinical efficacy studies of sEV-based therapies, there is an urgent imperative to design, implement, standardize, and validate new manufacturing protocols on larger scales. These protocols must enable the production of higher treatment doses, facilitating diverse therapeutic regimens for patients who stand to benefit from these innovative advanced therapies.",
        "This research demonstrates a pioneering clinical treatment employing UC-MSC-derived sEV for the treatment of OA, providing preclinical evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic modality, and culminating in safe translation to the clinic. A registered phase I safety trial is currently underway in which single doses of UC-MSC-sEV are administered by intra-articular injection in 12 patients with moderate knee OA (NCT no. 06431152; title: “Administration of sEV derived from UC-MSC in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: safety determination in a pilot dose-escalation study”) with a 12 month follow-up [80].",
        "This study establishes a standardized manufacturing protocol and a feasible workflow for clinical grade sEV. It demonstrates initial safety in a first-in-human IA administration. Additionally, by establishing a proof-of-concept for upcoming studies into cutting-edge therapy modalities for the management of OA, it fills the gap between preclinical promise and initial clinical application. Lastly, the developments discussed here provide a framework for developing regenerative medicine treatments for degenerative joint diseases.",

    "title": "The efficacy of intra-articular injections in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. progressive loss of articular cartilage. Intra-articular injections are a mainstay of nonoperative treatment, however, there is controversy as to the optimal injectable for these patients. The purpose of the current study is to perform a network meta-analysis of the randomized control trials in the literature to ascertain whether there is a superior injectable nonoperative treatment for knee OA. METHODS: The literature search was conducted based on the PRISMA guidelines. Randomized control trials (RCTs) evaluating intra-articular injectables in osteoarthritic knees were included. Data was extracted and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, where available were analyzed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Clinical outcomes were compared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical analysis performed using R. The treatment options were ranked using the P-Score. RESULTS: Seventy-nine RCTs with 8761 patients were included in this review. Intra-articular injectables evaluated included autologous conditioned serum (ACS), bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC), botulinum toxin, corticosteroids (CS), hyaluronic acid (HA), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), ozone, saline placebo, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), plasma rich in growth factor (PRGF), and stromal vascular fraction (SVF). At 4-6 weeks and 3 months of follow-up, the treatment with the highest P-Score for WOMAC score was high molecular weight (HMW) HA + CS [P-Score = 0.9500 and 8503, respectively]. At 6-months follow-up, the treatment with the highest P-Score for WOMAC score was PRP [P-Score = 0.7676]. At all post-injection time points, the treatment with the highest P-Score for VAS score [P-Score Range = 0.8631-9927] and Womac score at 12 Months [P-Score = 0.9044] was SVF. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence shows that SVF injections result in the greatest improvement in pain and functional outcomes in patients with knee OA at up to 1 year of follow-up.

        "Knee osteoarthritis has become one of the fastest increasing major health conditions faced by aging Americans [1, 2]. Management of knee osteoarthritis costs an estimated $89.1 billion annually in the USA as well as associated patient morbidity such as pain and activity limitations [3, 4]. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for cost-effective and reliable non-surgical treatment modalities that alleviate symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis, particularly for patients who are not yet eligible for total knee replacement [5, 6].",
        "Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections have been increasingly used for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis; however, the data supporting its use are heterogeneous and lacking consensus regarding indication and utility [7–14]. Many published articles have demonstrated the favorable pain relief and safety profile, ease of preparation and administration, and relatively low cost of PRP preparation. As such, the PRP market is expected to increase exponentially in the next ten years [15–17]. With this considerable financial incentive, there is increasing research and pressure to publish promising results of this emerging technology. However, there is significant criticism regarding the existing clinical and scientific evidence on PRP’s efficacy, given that previous research is inconclusive and limited by heterogeneity in PRP preparation and study design [7, 16, 18–21]. The considerable revenue generated from PRP and other orthobiologic injections used for the management of knee osteoarthritis, particularly when compared to other treatment modalities such as over-the-counter anti-inflammatories and physical therapy, may incentivize significant industry and financial interest to succeed [16].",
        "As researchers investigating the utilization of PRP for knee osteoarthritis may be incentivized to demonstrate positive findings, we sought to identify whether the literature evaluating the use of PRP for knee osteoarthritis was at increased risk of spin, defined as the reporting of data in a manner that overstates beneficial effects or understates negative effects despite insufficient evidence to support those conclusions [23–25]. Despite the available clinical practice guidelines, clinicians often make treatment decisions based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the primary goal of this study was to use a validated spin assessment tool to identify and categorize the incidence of spin and related bias in the abstracts of systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the utilization of PRP for knee osteoarthritis [23, 26, 27]. Secondary goals included establishing correlations between various spin types and abstract characteristics, including the year of publication, and the level of evidence included.",
        "A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search was conducted in Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane databases using a predetermined protocol [28]. Search terms included, (“Meta-Analysis [Publication Type] OR systematic review[Filter] OR\"systematic review\"OR\"systematic reviews\"OR meta-analysis OR metaanalysis OR “meta analysis” OR metanalysis OR meta-analyses OR metaanalyses OR “meta analyses” OR PRISMA”) AND (“Platelet-Rich Plasma” OR “PRP” OR “Platelet Rich Plasma” OR OR “Thrombocyte-Rich Plasma” OR “Thrombocyte Rich Plasma” OR OR “plasma rich in growth factors” OR PRGF OR “platelet derived growth factor” OR “platelet derived” OR “platelet gel” OR “platelet concentrate” OR PRF OR “platelet rich fibrin” OR ACP OR “autologous conditioned plasma” OR “APS” OR “autologous protein solution” OR “platelet lysate”) AND\"Osteoarthritis\"[Mesh] OR “osteoarthritis” OR “OA”). Results were collected and deduplicated using EndNote 20 (Clarivate, Philadelphia, PA, USA).",
        "Two independent authors (M.K.R. and N.M.K.) reviewed publications for study eligibility. Criteria included systematic reviews or meta-analyses published in English, peer-reviewed journals on the use of PRP as a primary treatment arm for knee osteoarthritis. Studies that were not systematic reviews or meta-analyses, not published in English, lacked an accessible full-text or abstract, or included non-human or cadaver subjects were excluded. Additionally, those that evaluated non-injectable PRP or PRP as a secondary study outcome or non-primary comparative group, or utilized injected PRP in a location that was not the knee, or for any indication other than knee osteoarthritis were excluded.",
        "After deduplication, 448 studies were retrieved using the search terms above, 79 of which were eligible for abstract evaluation after screening (Fig. 1, Supplemental Table 1). Two reviewers (M.K.R. and N.M.K.) were trained to identify the 21 types of spin as originally reported by Yavchitz et al. [27] to evaluate the abstracts of the identified studies (Table 1). There are three categories described including “misleading reporting,” “misleading interpretation,” and “inappropriate extrapolation.” The presence of each spin type received 1 point; the absence of each spin type received 0 points. The total score possible per abstract was 21 points, with higher scores indicating increasing frequency of spin. Each reviewer independently evaluated abstracts for the presence of spin per the validated tool. Full texts were reviewed if authors disagreed or if additional clarity was required. Scoring conflicts were mitigated by a third trained reviewer (C.K.M.). The full text was evaluated to collect the year and journal of publication, Level of Evidence according to guidelines published by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, study design, funding source, and reported adherence to PRISMA guidelines [28, 29].

        "Descriptive statistics, including frequency and percentage or the means and standard deviations, were utilized to characterize the frequency of each type of spin and the overall spin score. Furthermore, the five most common types of spin and the five most severe types of spin as defined by Yavchitz et al. [27] were assessed further by correlating spin type with the level of evidence and the year of publication. Spearman’s rank-order correlation was used to compare categorical variables (spin type with level of evidence and year of publication). The five most severe types included “conclusion formulating recommendations for clinical practice not supported by the findings,” “title claims or suggests a beneficial effect of the experimental intervention not supported by the findings,” “selective reporting of or overemphasis on efficacy outcomes favoring the beneficial effect of the experimental intervention,” “conclusion claiming safety based on non-statistically significant results with a wide confidence interval,” and “conclusion claiming the beneficial effect of the experimental treatment despite high risk of bias in primary studies.” Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 28.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA).",

        "The present study established that spin favoring the utilization of PRP injections is highly prevalent in abstracts of systematic reviews and meta-analyses for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. We demonstrated high frequency of spin, particularly those relating to misleading reporting or misleading data interpretation, high frequency of lack of identification of funding sources, limited protocol registration, and relatively low Scopus CiteScore™. As the first study of its kind, we noted consistent presentation of inaccurate information distributed via the abstract of manuscripts related to PRP [23, 31–36]. This is of particular concern given the increasing patient awareness of PRP as a therapeutic option in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, the increased utilization of PRP among orthopedic surgeons, and the well-documented reality that physicians often make clinical decisions based solely on abstracts [7, 16, 21, 37, 38]. These findings indicate appropriately powered and blinded RCTs with results presented in the absence of spin are necessary to (1) better evaluate the utility of PRP injections for knee osteoarthritis and (2) better counsel patients regarding expectations of this therapy [24, 25, 27].",
        "The most frequently reported spin types included “conclusion claiming the beneficial effect of the experimental treatment despite high risk of bias in primary studies” (84.8%), “failure to report a wide confidence interval of estimates” (72.2%), “authors hide or do not present any conflicts of interest” (58.2%), “ignoring that the review included different study design” (49.4%), and “failure to report the number of studies/patients actually contributing to the analysis for main outcomes” (49.4%). Furthermore, we identified at least one type of spin in 100% of assessed abstracts. In a spin assessment of systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating superior capsular reconstruction in the shoulder literature, Kim et al. [23] utilized a similar methodology in an evaluation of superior capsular release and reported a high frequency of “the conclusion claims the beneficial effect of the experimental treatment despite a high risk of bias in primary studies” at 65%. They similarly found 100% of included studies had at least one type of spin. In a study of PRP utilized for the treatment of orthopedic injury of the hand, foot and ankle, spine, hip, and knee, Reddy et al. [36] reported only 28.4% of included studies reported at least one type of spin. The rates of spin in the present study were similar to these previous reports, indicating that the abstracts included in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of PRP used for treatment of knee osteoarthritis have the potential to include misleading language.",
        "Outside of the orthopedic literature, however, the primary sources of spin differ and the overall frequency of spin appears to be substantially lower. For example, in an assessment of systematic reviews and meta-analyses focusing on percutaneous coronary intervention, Cole et al. [33] reported only 22.1% of included studies had at least one type of bias. Their most frequent form of spin, “selective reporting of, or overemphasis on efficacy outcomes or analysis favoring the beneficial effect of the experimental intervention,” was only present in 14.8% of included abstracts. Demla et al. [34] applied a similar spin assessment to systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating cataract therapies and found only 30.0% of included studies had at least one form of spin. Their highest frequency was also in the category “selective reporting of, or overemphasis on efficacy outcomes or analysis favoring the beneficial effect of the experimental intervention” (18.2%), which is also substantially lower than those noted in the present study, or that by Kim et al. In fact, these frequencies (14.8% and 18.2%) more closely resemble our 10th (21.5%) and 11th (12.7%) most common types of spin. Although a relative weighting is not a component of the spin scoring system, we additionally reported most severe types of spin recorded. To our knowledge, no other study to date implementing spin assessment has done this. While additional studies are needed to evaluate spin in other orthopedic procedures and topics, this represents concerning data, suggesting that systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the orthopedic literature may be vulnerable to distorted data reporting that over or understates effects with insufficient evidence when compared to other fields.",
        "Although PRP injections in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis are increasingly utilized, results such as these should give pause to orthopedic surgeons when evaluating the quality of data available to support their use. We acknowledge that high-quality data exist supporting the therapeutic effects of PRP when utilized for knee osteoarthritis [39–42]; however, the overall body of literature shows mixed effects, particularly with respect to functional, radiographic, and pain outcomes [9, 43–46]. Furthermore, given that PRP injections are not currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Association (FDA), many patients must pay for these procedures out of pocket. The average reported costs may be in excess of $714 per treatment, and some physicians utilize multiple injections for a given treatment course [43]. Moreover, the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons statement does not currently recommend the use of PRP due to the lack of beneficence, the high-cost, and potential safety issues [9]. The potential negative implications of elevated spin and distorted reporting in systematic reviews and meta-analyses may result in ongoing misinformation and misinterpretation of data related to these procedures. This evaluation similarly calls for increased high-quality assessments and a heightened awareness of spin by providers and journals as it pertains to distribution of information, and its impact on patient care and outcomes.",
        "There are several limitations and strengths of this evaluation. Many of the included abstracts were published in journals in which there are word count limitations. This indicates that some of the included studies may have unintentionally spun findings due to an inability to include the level of detail needed to provide appropriate context and reduce bias. However, there is a strong impetus for abstracts to be both accurate and non-distorted relative to the manuscript as many individuals reading the abstract may not have access to the full-text, nor the time to read the entire manuscript. Therefore, the present evaluation provides substantial value to understand how an orthopedic surgeon may interpret the body of literature describing PRP injections for knee osteoarthritis. Moreover, our findings should caution orthopedic surgeons considering PRP injections given spin in abstracts can lead to misinterpretation of results, and identification of favorable results even when studies lack significant findings [25, 32, 47]. Furthermore, this study is inherently limited by the spin tool employed. However, Yavchitz et al. [27] performed validation of their assessment tool, and it has been utilized a number of times in the published literature. Aside from these limitations, we utilized a validated tool, included a large sample of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and had a high degree of adherence to an established assessment protocol. Moreover, we demonstrated novel and concerning findings that highlight the need for improved reporting in orthopedic systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing the utilization of PRP injections for knee osteoarthritis. Ideally, orthopedic surgeons should pause prior to indicating patients for this treatment, to consider the quality of the evidence supporting its utilization particularly in light of the long-term outcomes and associated costs.",

    "title": "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Injections for the Treatment of Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials. people worldwide. The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the setting of osteoarthritis has been explored by many clinical trials in the literature. Exploring these clinical trials is important for assessing the benefit of this modality in the setting of osteoarthritis. METHODS: On November 9, 2022, a search was conducted on PubMed/MEDLINE databases to explore clinical trials involving MSC injections for osteoarthritis. Only articles that were clinical trials, explored the use of MSC injections in osteoarthritis, involved human subjects, and written in English language, were included. Relevant data was extracted from the included trials. RESULTS: A total of 43 trials were included (N=43). The knee was most the commonly explored joint (95.4%), and adipose tissue was the most commonly utilized MSC source (49%). All but one trial (97.7%) reported clinical improvement in the MSC group on follow up, and 33 trials (76.7%) reported better clinical outcomes in the MSC groups when compared to control groups. Twenty-three trials (53.5%) used imaging to evaluate outcomes following MSC injections, out of which twenty (46.5%) reported improvements in the affected joint. Similarly, four trials (9.3%) used second look arthroscopy, out of which three (7%) reported better outcomes on follow up. CONCLUSION: While published trials show good therapeutic potential for MSC injections in the setting of osteoarthritis, several discrepancies render the efficiency and reliability of this modality equivocal. The adoption of standardized protocols, employment of comprehensive evaluation tools, and reporting negative results is essential in order to appropriately assess the utility of MSC injections for the treatment of osteoarthritis.",

      "title": "The Use of MSCs, iPSCs, and EVs in the Repair of Human MSK Tissues: Is Ultimate Success Dependent on Developing Excellent Implant Materials as Well as Creating an Optimal Environment for Implantation? What Is the Rationale for These Choices?",
      "abstract": "It has been >35 years since the cells described as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were reported to have multi-lineage potential, which opened the possibility that they could be used to repair injured or diseased musculoskeletal tissues. Since that time, similar cells have been isolated from many tissues, again raising expectations that they could be used to repair or regenerate many types of tissues. While some progress in using these cells, as well as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to facilitate the repair of tissues has been achieved, an emerging body of literature would suggest that the cells in question facilitate repair via released extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain a cargo of molecules which induce endogenous cells to do the actual repair. How the “stemness” of the cells is involved in such processes remains to be elucidated. While progress in the repair of compromised tissues has been obtained, from some perspectives, the progress has been challenging and successful translation to patients has been slow. In part, this has been due to considerable emphasis being placed on the cells or EVs, and not as much on the environments in which they are implanted. However, successful outcomes likely depend on both the development of optimized materials to be implanted and an environment that is conducive to success after implantation. This perspective article reviews some of the options regarding the implantable materials and the variables or factors that could impact the local environment’s suitability for success following implantation. In addition, attempts are made to reconcile the designation of endogenous cells labeled MSCs and their potential roles as regulators of tissue integrity in vivo.",

While progress in the repair of compromised tissues has been obtained, from some perspectives, the progress has been challenging and successful translation to patients has been slow. In part, this has been due to considerable emphasis being placed on the cells or EVs, and not as much on the environments in which they are implanted. However, successful outcomes likely depend on both the development of optimized materials to be implanted and an environment that is conducive to success after implantation. This perspective article reviews some of the options regarding the implantable materials and the variables or factors that could impact the local environment’s suitability for success following implantation. In addition, attempts are made to reconcile the designation of endogenous cells labeled MSCs and their potential roles as regulators of tissue integrity in vivo.",
        "With there being rapidly aging societies around the world, many individuals are suffering from a loss of the age-related integrity of many of their tissues, particularly those of the musculoskeletal system, which impact mobility and many aspects of daily living. Prominent among these conditions and diseases are osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc degeneration, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and ligament and tendon injuries. For many of these conditions, effective interventions only treat the symptoms and do not lead to the return of tissue structural integrity.",
        "The discovery of what were termed mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) > 30 years ago [1,2,3] was a paradigm-shifting finding that initially offered the potential to repair and regenerate connective tissues. However, this initial euphoria led to considerable “hype” and the potential of these MSCs to meet these expectations was not realized to the extent that was suggested in the literature and by commercial entities. These limited and variable successes led to considerable research to better define the characteristics of the cells and their actual potential to repair and regenerate damaged connective tissues in vivo. This research has led to suggestions that, rather than “stem” cells, they are mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or medicinal signaling cells (MSCs) [4,5], with the latter name reflecting on the fact that the cells in question may not repopulate damaged or diseased tissues but instead secrete mediators or release EVs that modulate the behavior of resident cells to facilitate repair. Thus, what were originally labeled as “stem” cells function in many tissues as “regulatory” cells [6]. Thus, much has been learned about the cells in question, in terms of both their strengths and limitations.",
        "In contrast, studies to better define the state of the environment to which the MSCs and their products should be introduced, and whether to use cells or appropriately generated tissue engineered constructs containing MSCs or their products, have been less of a focus but are potentially equally important to the success of the interventions [7]. That is, putting optimally developed MSCs, their EVs with an optimal cargo content, or a specific tissue engineered construct into a suboptimal environment may very likely compromise the ultimate success of the intervention.",
        "Therefore, this perspective article will present and discuss advances on both sides of the field of connective tissue repair and regeneration and attempt to address how to integrate the two research efforts to enhance the potential for success in the clinical translation of findings.",
        "The repair and regeneration of tissues, with the potential to prolong healthy life, has been a long-term goal of many clinician-scientists and researchers. Just replacing injured or diseased tissues can be accomplished by the well-controlled transplantation of allogenic donor tissues, but this approach is not without risks, and most individuals would prefer to use their own autologous tissues and cells, if possible, to repair and regenerate tissues.",
        "In lieu of tissue transplantation, another option for repair is the use of stem cells. Embryonic stems cells that arise during development are one option that could be explored, but there are ethical concerns with using human embryonic cells, and there is also a risk of such cells developing cancers such as teratomas [8,9].",
        "Approximately 35 years ago, reports of MSCs came from Caplan’s lab [1,2] that offered another option to repair connective tissues. These cells were multipotent and could be differentiated into bone, cartilage, and adipocyte lineages using specific induction protocols. Such cells were found in nearly every tissue that was examined and could therefore be used in an autologous manner. The most used sources of MSCs for study in vitro or in preclinical models were from bone marrow [10], adipose tissue [11], and synovium [12,13], as well as cord blood [14], Wharton’s jelly [15], placenta [16], synovial fluid [17], amniotic fluid [18], and individual tissues. Of interest are the findings that those from bone marrow appear to prefer the osteogenic lineage when differentiated, while those from synovium appear to prefer the chondrogenic lineage reviewed in [6,12]; thus, MSC populations in different locations may serve specific functions in different environments.",
        "MSCs are also heterogeneous at the cell level, as determined by limiting dilution analysis [17]. While some reports have raised the possibility that such heterogeneity is associated with in vitro culturing and passaging the MSCs in vitro, as discussed in [6,19,20], population studies would indicate that some heterogeneity is intrinsic to specific locations. Regarding autologous repair approaches, the potential for additional individual variation in the “quality” of the MSC population (i.e., via genetics and epigenetics) in any particular location could also impact the success of their use in repairing a damaged tissue [21,22].",
        "In spite of a number of limitations [21,23] in the use of MSCs, reagents which are usually defined by their functional lineage differentiation phenotype and cell-surface antigen phenotype [24,25,26,27,28], some successes with connective tissue repair have been reported for conditions such as osteoarthritis, as reviewed in [29,30], and cartilage defects [31]. An example of one of these successes was the use of human synovium-derived MSCs in a tissue engineered construct (TEC) to effectively repair human knee cartilage defects [12,13,32,33,34]. In a small pilot study of five patients (the maximum allowed by the Japanese agency funding the study), the implantation of a TEC containing undifferentiated MSCs in a self-generated matrix led to the long-term (>5 years) repair of the damaged tissue [13,32,33,34]. The in vivo-generated repair tissue expressed collagen II and developed a superficial zone following implantation and, therefore, the implanted cells either differentiated into zone-specific chondrocytes or convinced endogenous cells to generate repair hyaline cartilage and replace the matrix of the TEC, which initially contained collagen I, with a collagen II-rich matrix. It is too soon to say that the injured cartilage was totally “regenerated” and, based on earlier results from studies in porcine models [35,36], the repair of hyaline cartilage may not have a completely regenerated surface. In spite of this potential limitation, the 5-year post-implantation findings are very positive regarding the ability of this intervention to prevent knee hyaline cartilage defects in humans from progressing to osteoarthritis. Based on the initial success of this TEC MSC pilot program, a larger multi-arm clinical trial is currently underway in Japan.",
        "However, it should also be noted that the TEC implanted in these studies was mainly prepared using autologous MSC, so it is not possible to determine whether the implanted cells repopulated the repair tissue or facilitated repopulation by endogenous cells. However, this could be assessed further, as allogenic cells also appear to function well in this porcine model [37], and cells from females could be implanted into the cartilage defects of males and the cells in the repair tissue could be assessed by karyotyping. Thus, this approach of using synovium-derived MSCs is very effective in cartilage repair and demonstrates the successful translation from a relevant porcine model to humans [34]. With continued improvement in this technique, such as regulating the oxygen tension to enhance the cartilage-directed differentiation of the MSC [38], current successes may be further optimized.",
        "In addition to cartilage repair, this approach of using a TEC and synovium-derived MSCs has also shown some success in other applications in relevant preclinical models. These include the repair of osteochondral defects in a rabbit model [31], as well as the repair of meniscal defects in both rabbit [39] and porcine [40] preclinical models. As meniscal injuries are common and their repair is critical to preventing the development of osteoarthritis, the translation of preclinical findings to human conditions should also be a priority [41]. Therefore, the continued optimization of the use of TEC in relevant preclinical models may lead to additional clinical trials in the near future.",
        "While much research continues to investigate the use of MSCs in the repair of musculoskeletal tissues and others, it was noted that many cells, including MSCs, release small EVs during their culture, as discussed in [42,43,44,45], and these vesicles contain a variety of bioactive molecules including proteins, miRNA, mRNA, and lipids [46]. The content or “cargo” of EVs can vary depending on the differentiation status of the MSC, the source of the cells, as discussed in [47], the age [48,49] and sex [50,51] of the donor, and the species of the donor, as discussed in [52]. The functioning of EVs may be the mechanism by which MSCs are able to facilitate repair via modifying the activity of endogenous cells in the target site and their ability to respond appropriately. Thus, EVs could be released by appropriate MSCs, recognized by endogenous cells via membrane-associated recognition systems, as discussed in [20], and then taken up by these cells to facilitate cell activation/modification that leads to an enhanced repair capability.",
        "Since 2000, the field of EV generation, characterization, and function has expanded dramatically, with international journals dedicated to publishing relevant articles (i.e., Journal of Extracellular Vesicles) and organized societies formulating criteria for their study, definitions, guidelines, position papers, and characterization (i.e., International Society for Extracellular Vesicles; http://www.isev.org, accessed on 24 June 2025). Such efforts have greatly advanced the field as, early on, the names used to describe these vesicles were varied (i.e., exosomes, different names for vesicles of different sizes, extracellular vesicles) and attempts to standardize names and characteristics have allowed for more clarity and a better ability to compare the results of different studies.",
        "As with the early days of MSCs, the field of EVs has been complicated by the conditions of generation (i.e., cells they are derived from, cargo content variation, and conditions of generation—i.e., presence of serum or serum-free culture) discussed in [53,54,55]. Regarding the latter point of potential serum effects, it appears that the generation of serum, such as the widely used fetal bovine serum (FBS), leads to contamination by EVs present in the serum, as well as small-sized particulates that may be generated by the actual coagulation process [55]. Not only would the presence of such bovine-associated EVs complicate the study of MSC-derived EVs, serum-associated EVs and particulates could also interfere with the activity of MSC-derived EVs generated in the presence of serum [55]. Therefore, if a serum source is required in a study of EVs, it should be centrifuged at >100,000× g for an extended period of time to eliminate these confounding elements.",
        "In spite of the emerging nature of EV applications, preparations of EVs have been investigated for their efficacy in treatments for osteoarthritis [56,57,58], intravertebral disc degeneration [59], tendon injury [60], ligament healing [61], bone integrity and repair [62,63,64], meniscal repair [65,66,67], chronic wounds [68], and muscle [69]. Thus, EVs may be useful for mediating connective tissue repair in a variety of circumstances and their cargo of miRNA may play important roles in the repair of connective tissues such as bone and cartilage [70], the intervertebral disc [71], and the meniscus [72].",
        "While EVs may be an important mechanism for the functioning of MSCs, offer the advantage of having a minimal potential to cause cancer, and have no nucleus, they do have the limitation of a short half-life when applied in vivo. That is, if effective repair requires prolonged exposure to EV, having the continuous generation of EVs via implanted MSCs rather than the repeated injection of EVs may be the most effective strategy to optimize repair. At some point, the implanted cells would no longer be needed and then would perhaps die by a mechanism that would not induce subsequent inflammation. This concept is exemplified by a recent study by Nakagawa et al. [73] that used human donor cells in a nude rat model, where implantation of the human constructs led to the effective repair of osteochondral defects but human cells were no longer present in the mature repair tissue.",
        "While MSCs/PMRCs have long been the focus of intense investigation regarding their “stem cell” or multi- or pluripotency potential to repair tissues of the MSK system, a second option regarding pluripotency arose from the work of Yamanaka’s laboratory, which described the ability to “reprogram” adult somatic cells in vitro using a cocktail of four factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4) [74,75]. These cells, called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), offer potential for tissue repair, but the original description using c-Myc raised concern regarding the potential to result in tumors and led to attempts to generate the cells without c-Myc [76]. Since 2006, many investigations have characterized the generation and use of iPSCs in a variety of repair/regeneration situations, as reviewed in [77,78,79,80], and improvements in the protocols for generating iPSCs are discussed in [81,82,83].",
        "Included in these studies on iPSCs are several which are focused on different tissues of the MSK system, as reviewed in [84], such as tendons [85,86,87,88], cartilage [89,90,91,92,93,94,95], intervertebral discs [96,97], bone [98,99,100], and ligament [101]. Most studies are in vitro or in animals, including mini pigs [95], where iPSCs and MSCs were compared, horses [102,103], goats [104], and companion animals [105]. While a number of studies have used iPSCs in large animal models, there is a paucity of information regarding clinical trials in patients that used MSK applications. However, some in the dental field have been reported, as reviewed in [106]. There is a need for more clinical trials in this area, as discussed in [107], and some countries such as Japan have a national program to foster and advance the clinical applications of different types of stem cell therapy for a variety of conditions, as discussed in [108].",
        "Similar to natural MSCs, iPSCs can also generate EVs, and these EVs have been studied for their cargo content and characterized for their potential application in tissue repair [43,109,110,111]. When EVs from MSCs and iPSCs were compared, considerable variation in their cargo content was observed [112], as well as lineage-specific differences [113]. Thus, for specific applications regarding connective tissue repair, generating optimized EV cargo content will be required to enhance the potential for success of this method. However, continued assessment and investigation may identify some commonalities, such as defined miRNAs that are essential, as discussed in [111]. Thus, both MSCs and iPSCs may be used for specific applications to repair MSK tissues, and their respective EVs may also be used to better characterize how the implanted cells impact endogenous cells to facilitate repair/regeneration.",
        "In summary, there are several different options for using multipotent cells or EVs derived from such cells to repair damaged connective tissues of the musculoskeletal system, with each option having advantages and limitations (Table 1). While considerable progress in understanding both the cell and tissue biology of these options and their potential applications to improve the repair of damaged or diseased tissues has been made, much of the research remains in vitro or in preclinical models. Optimization of the success regarding outcomes will depend on factors such as the source/origin and quality of the cells or EVs to be implanted, as well as the biological site of implantation, the state of the environment (i.e., inflammation; anabolic or catabolic) that the cells or EVs will be implanted in, the nature of the scaffold use to keep the materials at the site of implantation, and the biomechanical environment [114].",
        "As outlined in Section 1, the field(s) of connective tissue repair and “regeneration” use what were initially labelled MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells) [1,2] and then emerged as MSCs (mesenchymal stromal cells) followed by MSCs (medicinal signaling cells) [4,5] as the field matured and more insights were illuminated, particularly as the advent of a body of knowledge regarding EVs developed. Thus, over time, less emphasis was placed on the “stem” aspects and more on the regulatory aspects of the cells, particularly with regard to EVs. Therefore, names do matter as they should be accurate, reflect the cells’ function, and can likely influence expectations by both researchers and patients.",
        "While the abbreviation for the cells in question, MSC, has been retained through their history, their role in tissue repair has evolved and, thus, the retention of MSC as a name is also somewhat confusing for the literature and, potentially, patients who are targeted by commercial companies offering “stem cells” in the treatment of connective tissue diseases such as osteoarthritis, or even diseases and conditions of other biological systems (i.e., brain, heart, liver, kidneys). Thus, they could be called pluripotent mesenchymal regulatory cells (PMRCs), a name which recognizes their multi-lineage potential, their mesenchymal origins, and their regulatory function [6], or, more appropriately, multipotent mesenchymal regulatory cells (MMRCs). Such names also do not presuppose that their primary role is related to tissue repair and regeneration, which the field appears to have accepted without considering other roles. Their regulatory role, the finding that these cells are located as pericytes in nearly all tissues [3,115], and their decline in numbers and perhaps function with age (decreasing at a time in the lifespan when they might be more needed for tissue repair functions) may indicate that they have other functions earlier in life such as during times of rapid and integrated growth and maturation of tissues and organ systems [115]. The ability of these cells, initially labeled MSCs, to enhance the repair of damaged tissues could also play important functions in the coordinated and integrated growth associated with the period of time from birth to puberty and then from puberty to skeletal maturity [115]. The function of these cells in the growth and maturation following puberty may mean that they are further regulated by sex hormones to some degree. This could explain some of the reported sex-specific differences in EVs derived from these and other cells [116,117]. That this concept has validity is shown by the results of the studies of Nakagawa et al. [73], who showed that, in a xenogeneic model, the implanted cells disappeared and were replaced by endogenous cells in the repair tissue. Such findings also indicate that the mediators of the effect(s) of the implanted cells (i.e., EVs and/or secreted molecules) are not species-specific, as human cells were implanted into an immune compromised rat model. Consistent with the concept that MSCs/MMRCs and iPSCs function mainly via using EVs to facilitate the repair of damaged tissues of the MSK system (discussed in Section 1.2.2), the paracrine functions of these cells dominate their function in vivo rather than their “stem cell” characteristics. If that is the case, why do MSCs retain their “stem cell” characteristics when isolated from a variety of tissues? Further, there are two other important questions: (1) is “stemness” necessary to develop specific lineages and subsequently specific cargos in the EVs; and (2) is “stemness” related to other, as yet unknown, functions of the cells, as indicated by them maintaining tissue integrity when they are subjected to environmental and metabolic stresses? In addition, while there are some characteristics which differ between MSCs derived from different tissues [118], there could also be different subsets of cells with “stemness” or multipotency within a tissue, and they may have different functions. This topic should be a focus of future studies as even MSCs that freshly isolated from tissues appear to be heterogeneous [17].",
        "While the cells currently called MSCs by nearly all of the field may have other functions, that does not detract from their “stem cell” capabilities, as they have demonstrated the potential to repair tissues damaged by disease and/or injury. However, if they have multiple roles to play in health and disease, one should not lose that perspective, and in that regard, names likely matter to those active in the field and those looking to the field for research and clinical application guidance. From this perspective, the environment into which such cells are implanted will likely influence the ability of such cells to perform specific functions. Thus, attempting to function in an inflammatory environment may be critical for specific response patterns, as discussed in [102].",
        "Following injury to a connective tissue such as those within joints, tendons, skin, muscles, or oral cavities, the host usually responds to the insult with an acute inflammatory response. This response is designed to remove damaged tissue components, thwart any infectious agents, and initiate a rapid fibrotic response. In tissues such as skin, this leads to scar formation and protection of the host via closing the breach in this protective layer. However, a similar breach in the mucosal surface of the oral cavity heals with an outcome closer to regeneration [119,120].",
        "While this outcome mediated by inflammatory responses is protective for skin, for connective tissues that require structural features to function optimally in a biomechanically active environment, such as ligaments, tendons, articular cartilage, and menisci, this “protective” inflammatory response leads to mechanically inferior outcomes in nearly all cases, as discussed in [114]. This concept can be observed during development, as some injuries to the human fetus can heal via regeneration (i.e., scarless wound healing) early during gestation, and this response then converts to a scar formation response later in development, as discussed in [121,122,123]. This conversion is associated with several factors including the development of an inflammatory response, as discussed in [124,125,126]. It has also been demonstrated in some adult preclinical models where treatment immediately after injury with anti-inflammatory agents (i.e., glucocorticoids) prevents the development of osteoarthritis-like disease in the knee. This has been reported for multiple preclinical models including rabbits [127,128,129,130], sheep [131], and pigs [132], and appears to be a general phenomenon and not species-specific. However, evidence for large clinical trials in patients could not be found. When interventions such as corticosteroids are given, the circumstances may impact the outcomes [133]. Caution in this regard is likely warranted as high doses of steroids can influence intraarticular MSC function [134].",
        "Regarding the role of acute inflammatory processes in the environment being considered for an MSC/iPSC/EV intervention, additional points need to be raised and discussed. First, an acute inflammatory response can evolve into a chronic inflammatory response if the initial insult persists, as discussed in [135,136,137], and a chronic inflammatory state can be challenging to control. As a chronic inflammatory state has features which differ from an acute inflammatory reaction, it can be difficult to regulate and interfere with chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis [138,139,140,141], which is often a target of stem/stromal cell therapies [142]. Thus, a non-healing chronic wound in a person with diabetes, such as foot ulcers [143,144] or a tendon rupture [145], may be an environment that could compromise the success of cellular and/or EV therapy. Furthermore, it has been reported that iPSCs can be influenced by inflammatory cytokines [102], so their function could be impacted by the environment.",
        "A second point is that genetic or stochastic variables that occur shortly after an acute injury to a connective tissue can influence long term outcomes even without an intervention. Using rupture of the human Achilles tendon as an example, it has been shown recently using proteomic approaches that that the analysis of tissue samples and fluids taken days (time of surgery) or weeks (2 weeks post-surgery), respectively, after the injury can identify biomarkers that can predict excellent or poor outcomes at 1-year post-injury, as reviewed in [146,147,148,149,150,151]. Several of these biomarkers represent elements of inflammation and immune-mediated events. Defining what constitutes an environment that leads to a favorable outcome versus an unfavorable outcome and developing interventions to enhance poor endogenous environments would be critical for enhancing the potential success of any MSC/iPSC/EV interventions in patients with such environments following an injury (i.e., complete rupture of a tendon) or chronic inflammation of the tendon (i.e., chronic tendinopathy).",
        "A third point relates to the influence of co-morbidities on the environment following an injury or during a chronic connective tissue disease. Thus, conditions like diabetes [152] and kidney disease [153] can contribute to dysfunctional healing and repair processes. In patients, diabetes can contribute to the development of chronic wound risk [152,154,155], and in rat models of tendon healing, the induction of diabetes can contribute to compromised healing [145]. Dysregulated glucose control in diabetic states can also lead to altered extracellular matrices due to the formation of advanced glycation end (AGE) products [156,157]. Such alterations can subsequently lead to interactions with macrophages that express the receptor for AGE (RAGE), contributing to an inflammatory environment [158]. An environment with compromised natural healing may also contribute to a lack of success with MSC/iPSC/EV interventions as well.",
        "In addition to co-morbidities, self-inflicted conditions resulting from smoking can lead to both alterations in endogenous MSC cells [159,160] and alterations to long-term connective tissue repair outcomes [161,162], although there are some mixed results in this area, as reviewed in [163]. In part, the effect of smoking may include effects on the vascular system [164]. In addition to effects on MSCs, smoking may also impact the function of iPSCs [165,166,167]. Therefore, smoking and vaping should be avoided to remove deleterious effects on both the multipotent cells and the environment.",
        "As many of these co-morbidities appear with aging, in which older patients may require more interventions to repair injured and/or diseased tissues, the local and systemic environments of the patient likely need to be addressed if they can compromise the effectiveness of MSC/iPSC/EV-based interventions. Thus, a fourth point relates to healing environments that are not compromised by co-morbidities but are instead influenced by “aging” processes. This consideration of the environment is complicated by the disconnect between biological and chronological aging, as discussed in [168,169,170]. However, for some tissues such as tendons and ligaments, the stiffness of the tissues changes with age, possibly due to alterations in the expression of the lubricant PRG4 [171,172,173]. There can also be increases in collagen cross-linking with age [174,175], another alteration which influences the mechanical properties of the tissue. Furthermore, there also appears to be a decline in the number of MSCs in tissues with age, and if these cells are involved in responses to MSC/EV interventions for connective tissue repair/regeneration, then, with increasing age, there would be fewer cells to respond, and these cells might be functionally compromised [176].",
        "A fifth point regarding the environment relates to sex differences and also the fact that, for females, the hormonal environment is not constant. Furthermore, the hormonal environment can influence the inflammatory environment [177,178,179,180,181]; thus, a critical feature of the environment that any MSC/iPSC/EV-based intervention would be implanted in in vivo is variable across the lifespan in females (i.e., puberty, skeletal maturity, menopause). Furthermore, after puberty and before menopause, the hormonal environment would be variable depending on menstrual cycles and pregnancy. After menopause, the environment would be deficient of estrogen and progesterone but still have testosterone present. This, of course, can be altered by taking HRT and HRT-like regimens, but some secondary sequalae of menopause may still be altered.",
        "From this discussion, it is clear that “one size does not fit all” when it comes to the optimal environment for MSCs/iPSCs/EVs alone or in engineered constructs to be implanted in (summarized in Table 2). As such, the expectations regarding the success of the outcomes of such implantations will have to be clearly managed. That is, can such implants be used to enhance outcomes in environments compromised by co-morbidities, inflammatory conditions, age or genetics, or is tissue regeneration still the goal? The former is likely a more pragmatic and achievable goal, while the latter is a worthwhile pursuit, but is likely going to be a long-term effort that will have to be tailored for the best MSCs/iPSCs/EVs for unique subsets of environments. While the focus of this discussion has been connective tissues of the MSK system, many of the considerations may also apply to other organ systems such as degenerative neurological conditions, renal diseases, and pulmonary conditions.",
        "It should also be pointed out that the presence of co-morbidities and the medications used to control such complications, as well as aging factors, may not only influence the environment that MSCs/iPSCs/EVs are implanted into but also the quality of the materials that are implanted if autologous cells/EVs are generated for re-introduction. Thus, in some circumstances, the use of minimally immunogenic allogenic materials should be considered.",
        "From the above discussions, it is evident that optimizing both the materials to be implanted to facilitate damaged tissue repair and the environment into which they will be implanted are likely both critical for the expected level of success regarding the outcomes. Furthermore, consideration should be given to the integration of their development rather than their independent evaluation.",
        "For this approach to succeed, the initial target should likely be a specific patient subset, with definable criteria being used. For acute situations, such as the trauma-induced development of a cartilage defect, the rupture of a tendon such as an Achilles tendon (AT), or severing a flexor tendon of the hand, this would likely require a rapid response protocol using allogenic MSCs/iPSCs or EVs prepared for the situation.",
        "For the rupture of an AT, a rapid biomarker assessment protocol to determine whether the patient was a “good” or poor” outcome candidate [146,147,148] or at risk to develop a DVT [149], as well as the sex of the patient, would lead to the implantation of a suitable pre-prepared delivery system since the window of opportunity is short. As EVs and MSCs are reported to be of low immunogenicity, as discussed in [182,183,184], they could theoretically be used without fear of rejection until they were no longer required to facilitate repair by endogenous cells. As demonstrated by the study by Nakagawa et al. [73], even in a rat model where immune rejection was not an issue, the implanted human MSCs and iPSCs disappeared from the mature repair tissue. In the case of a ruptured flexor tendon, one would likely have to consider the repair of the tendon proper, as well as the sheath [185,186,187,188,189]. In this situation, not only is tissue repair an issue, but the inhibition of adhesion formation between the tendon and sheath [188,189] is also required. This latter target may require the addition of a further intervention such as the use of a molecule such as a lactoferrin peptide to induce PRG4, a boundary lubricant that can minimize adhesion [190,191]. These issues are likely important to resolve as MSCs have been used for flexor tendon repair with variable results, as reviewed in [192].",
        "In the case of a chronic condition such as osteoarthritis, where hyaline cartilage needs to be repaired/regenerated, a somewhat different approach likely needs to be considered. First, the inflammation needs to be controlled. Second, there should be sufficient endogenous tissue and cells available to allow the implanted cells/materials to facilitate repair. Therefore, repair should be considered early rather than later in the disease progression when little endogenous tissue remains. This approach conceptually goes against much of current medical practice, which generally endorses a more conservative approach until the disease progresses, a timeline that may diminish the opportunity for cellular therapy success. A limitation of addressing tissue repair in osteoarthritis of the knee, for example, is that one may not know when the condition actually started, as diagnosis is usually dependent on the appearance of symptoms; secondarily, the term osteoarthritis is an umbrella term for multiple causations [193]. One subset includes trauma to structures such as the anterior cruciate ligament that can affect the biomechanical functioning of the knee as an organ system, a situation that may put excessive loading on the repair tissue and thus lead to the reoccurrence of osteoarthritis due to degeneration of the repair tissue.",
        "The induction of a cartilage defect in the femoral condyle or tibial plateau presents an interesting scenario for the use of MSCs in a TEC to repair this defect in patients [12,13,32,33]. It can be uniquely addressed, as it is known when the defect occurred, and one can derive effective MSCs populations and subsequently EVs from them, elements that can be used to generate good outcomes based on the results of pilot studies [13,32,33]. One could also attempt to regulate the inflammatory environment via the controlled use of corticosteroids [127,128,129,130,131,132]. Finally, one can debride the edges of the cartilage defect to generate a suitable implant site. As well, the TEC used in such studies adheres to the defect site without the need for suturing, which is also an advantage. Thus, one could generate a TEC for use in such circumstances using autologous cells or have a pre-prepared TEC that incorporates appropriate allogenic cells. However, as a cartilage defect site can progress to overt osteoarthritis over time, it is still not clear as to when such a site may convert from an “acute” site to a “chronic” site and require a modified approach to facilitate optimized repair.",
        "While EVs may need to be optimized for specific applications, MSCs or advanced iPSCs will likely still be needed for implantation in vivo for many applications if EVs are the vehicle for the cellular effects; thus, the situation may require the chronic generation of EVs from the cells to optimize long-term tissue repair. Furthermore, the “stem cell” properties of MSCs and iPSCs may be very useful in the treatment of diseases and conditions where the loss of endogenous matrix and cells is extensive, but this type of application may require unique scaffolds that mimic the natural ECM to encourage the appropriate differentiation of the implanted cells.",
        "One of the main questions that arises from the discussion in Section 4 is whether it is technically feasible to both generate an optimal cellular component to facilitate the effective repair of damaged connective tissue and to optimize the in vivo environment to enhance outcomes to meet expectations. Failing that set of circumstances, what is the best compromise to realistically offer a fairly long-term solution that improves the quality of life for the affected patients? It is likely that not all of the variables outlined in Section 4 exert equal influence on the outcomes; therefore, the understanding of some will have a higher priority than that of others. In this regard, some of the variables that can be defined (i.e., biological age, sex, obesity, co-morbidities, history, inflammatory biomarkers) may be investigated, but the role of others such as genetic variability may prove to be more challenging at some levels but not others. For example, if a “good” versus “poor” outcome after a rupture of the AT [146,147,148,149,150,151] has a genetic basis, then the genetic variation could be defined and addressed with tailored interventions. However, if the basis for different outcomes is primarily stochastic, then finding a solution may be more challenging but still addressable on an individual basis.",
        "It is clear that after >35 years since their discovery, the expectations surrounding MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells), as originally described for connective tissues as well as for the cells in the brain—to address serious brain conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other degenerative conditions—have perhaps not been met regarding their use to repair damaged or diseased tissues.",
        "While progress has been and is being made in the use of MSCs, iPSCs, and EVs in several connective tissue conditions, many challenges have been encountered which have contributed to variable results when attempts to repair and regenerate human connective tissues have been undertaken. However, advances have been made in using MSCs in areas such as cartilage defect repair [32,33,34,194], knee osteoarthritis, as reviewed in [194], IVD degeneration, as reviewed in [195], and bone healing, as reviewed in [196], as well as in using iPSCs in primate models [197] and human iPSCs into rat models [73,198]. In human clinical trials, variability in outcomes has been noted for some of the conditions that were investigated, so new understanding is required, particularly with regard to the host environment. However, with regard to this latter issue, some advances have also been made using non-invasive techniques such as the MRI assessment of degenerated IVD to reveal alterations in oxygen and glucose levels that could affect the outcomes after the implantation of MSCs/iPSCs/EVs [199,200].",
        "Thus, a serious analysis of what has been learned during those 35 years, as well as a better understanding of why better progress has not been made, needs to be carried out. A major part of the problem with both connective tissue conditions and diseases, as well as brain conditions, is that we do not understand the basic disease mechanisms and are thus mainly treating symptoms rather than disrupting disease processes and regenerating damaged tissues that retain optimal function.",
        "One goal going forward should be to ask more questions regarding what these cells labeled MSCs (or MMRCs) are actually doing in the various tissue they reside in normally. They do exhibit multipotency, and they likely contribute an endogenous role via appropriate paracrine signaling, which leads to the micro-repair of some differentiated cells in specific tissues. The finding that MSCs in bone marrow appear to prefer the osteogenic lineage while knee synovial MSCs prefer the chondrogenic lineage contributes to such conclusions, indicating location-specific preferences. The extensive heterogeneity of MSCs isolated from the same specific location is still a topic that needs explanation, as discussed in [17,201]. Some of the heterogeneity in MSC populations has been proposed to be an artifact of in vitro culturing, as discussed in [6,19,20], and if this is the case, why does it arise (i.e., inherent instability, in vitro culture conditions)?",
        "Given some of the limitations associated with MSCs, should the field refocus to more extensively investigate the use of iPSCs, which can be generated under defined conditions, or are iPSCs just another approach to developing more effective EVs? While there is currently cancer risks associated with iPSCs generated using c-Myc as one of the factors [202,203,204], continual improvements in the technology may lead to a more risk-free cell population [83,205,206]. Thus, a well-characterized set of iPSCs, to be used either in an autologous or allogenic manner, may be a valuable alternative to the use of endogenous MSCs. However, both MSCs and iPSCs may offer advantages for specific applications, such as the generation of EVs with specific cargos. Thus, both cell types may have unique advantages and should continue to be investigated.",
        "A particular focus should continue to be placed on the emerging role of EVs in facilitating the repair of MSKs and other tissues. Excellent progress has been made in characterizing the efficacy of these methods and some of this progress has been detailed in recent reviews by Nallakumarasamy et al. [207], Teo et al. [208], Liao et al. [209], and Kasula et al. [210]. As reviewed by Zhang et al. [211], EVs appear to influence the activities of several cell types during skin wound healing, including endogenous fibroblasts and immune cells involved in inflammatory processes. Thus, EVs from donor cells can interact with multiple cell types. Whether they use different membrane molecules to interact with different cell types or some common recognition system remains to be determined, and as reviewed by Hart [20], there are several options that are known. It may be possible to also modify their targeting, as described by Antes et al. [212]. Further characterization of their targeting and mechanisms of action could lead to engineered EVs that could target specific cells and serve as drug delivery systems, as discussed by Rodriguz and Vader [213], Abid et al. [214], and Liu et al. [215]. The continued evolution of such studies could lead to artificially generated EVs with specific targeting molecules, cargo contents, and applications for specific MSK conditions, as reviewed by Rosso and Cauda [216]. Such studies could also offer advantages to overcome any local environmental variables that inhibit “natural” EV function (i.e., proteinases, glycosidases, lipases, pH). Thus, the continued development of materials to be implanted or injected is an on-going research effort, and efforts to optimize their function and specificity should be performed in parallel with other activities related to the environment that they will be implanted in.",
        "Whichever choice of cells and derived EVs is pursued, and likely all should be pursued at this point, the use of optimal preclinical models should be entertained. It is likely that this should involve large animal models rather than rodents. Considerable investigation of the use of MSCs in rodent models has been accomplished over the past 30+ years and it has been found that they do offer the advantage of restricted genetic heterogeneity; further, the ability to knock out genes and the cost of using large numbers is manageable. However, the success rate of translating the findings from inbred rodents to humans is not high, which is likely due to the considerable heterogeneity in human populations. Thus, the strength of the inbred mouse models, genetic restriction, may be a weakness for translation to a heterogeneous population.",
        "Therefore, to enhance the likelihood of successful translation of the findings to human populations, the focus should perhaps be on large animal models that reflect the human population more accurately. For example, different breeds of domestic pigs exist which provide some genetic heterogeneity, and the genomes of these breeds have been sequenced [217,218,219], as well as that of miniature swine [220]. Their physiology has features that are similar in some aspects to humans, as discussed in [220], some of their joints are similar in size to humans, as discussed in [221,222], their weight and metabolism can be modified by diet, they can be manipulated at the genetic level if required by selective breeding, and they breed well, yielding large numbers of offspring per litter. However, they are still quadrupeds and are costly to maintain. As an example of successful use, Nakamura’s group used porcine models to validate the use of TEC containing synovial MSCs, as reviewed in [34,35,37], prior to the effective translation of the technology to human patients with cartilage defects [13,32,33]. Thus, the use of porcine models has proven valuable in this circumstance and may also prove to be valuable in other well-designed projects that involve the use of MSCs/iPSCs/EVs to address human tissue repair applications.",
        "Building on the findings from the Nakamura group and others using porcine models, one could further investigate the ability to regulate the inflammatory response following an injury to a joint, tendon, ligament, or muscle or in the context of a co-morbidity such as diabetes. Furthermore, while the translation of the cartilage defect model using a TEC was successful [13,32,33], one could also investigate the effect of the time post-injury on the ability to obtain successful repair. As the time post-cartilage defect injury leads to the induction of an osteoarthritis-like condition in both animals [223,224] and humans [225,226], such studies may be very informative for assessing future translation potential. For example, in the porcine model used by Nakamura’s group to repair cartilage defects, instead of repairing the defects immediately, one could initiate defects and then attempt repair with a TEC using synovial MSCs at increasing times post-initiation to assess when and how the local environment becomes altered and poses risk for a decline in the success of the implantation. Learning how to improve the in vivo environment may then lead to translational interventions to enhance implantation in patients with early OA.",
        "In addition to porcine models, other large models to be considered include sheep [227], goats [104], and horses [224]. The use of cats and dogs has fallen out of favor in many places due to reluctance to use companion animals, and the use of non-human primates is not only ethically challenging but also very costly but may be feasible at some specialized centers. In spite of these limitations, some chondrodystrophic dogs can be good models for connective tissue disease studies and provide valuable insights into disease processes, such as in the studies of Thompson et al. [228]. In addition, companion animals such as dogs and cats may also be the target of clinical applications for tissue repair, so some use of them in research may be warranted and necessary. Similarly, horses are both companion animals and used for racing so should also likely be used in some studies.",
        "Aside from the use of in vivo models to gain further insights into the role of MSCs, some in vitro studies using cells, organoids, or connective tissue explants may provide additional information regarding the function of these cells. However, as nearly all of the connective tissues involved in the in vivo conditions function in mechanically active environments, care should be taken to perform in vitro studies in mechanically active environments to avoid forming conclusions that are not relevant when cells are mechanically loaded. Connective tissue cells [229,230,231,232], MSCs [233,234,235], iPSCs [236,237], organoids [238,239,240,241,242], and connective tissue explants [243,244] have all have been shown to respond to mechanical loading, and in the case of meniscal explants [244] and tendon explants [245], they were shown to require in vitro mechanical loading to maintain tissue integrity.",
        "Clearly, the potential role of EVs in tissue repair and regeneration has emerged as an important mechanism that is used by both MSCs and iPSCs [246,247,248,249,250]. Therefore, how the mechanical loading of the relevant cells influences EV release from these cells and potentially influences the cargo of EVs is not well understood. Furthermore, how the loading of tissues in vivo affects EV uptake is not well characterized. This area needs more investigation. As the loading of relevant cells in vitro can alter their responses to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 [251,252,253,254,255] and the in vivo environment [240], there is likely potential for mechanical loading to influence these other aspects of cell function both in vivo and in vitro. These topics should be the subject of future investigation.",
        "Therefore, to optimize the translation potential of future investigation of the application of MSCs, iPSCs, and EVs, in vitro studies should be performed using conditions that best mimic the in vivo environment. For example, appropriate large animal models should that offer the best opportunities for translation should be employed, and injury and disease models should reflect those occurring in humans as accurately as possible. As the ability to respond to mechanical loading is critical for the in vivo function of repair tissue, assessing how such cells and constructs respond to appropriate mechanical loading in vitro may not only prepare the materials to better survive in the post-implantation environment, but may also enhance our understanding of how they function in such environments. For example, do cells generate appropriate EVs when they are loaded vs unloaded, and do EVs function in vivo under loading conditions the same as in vitro? The answers to such questions are likely important to foster in vivo post-implantation success and outcomes.",
        "The effective cellular therapy for the repair and regeneration of connective tissues requires both the appropriate cells (i.e., MSC, iPSC) and cellular constituents (i.e., EVs), as well as an optimal environment to receive the interventions. Without congruence between these two factors, successful outcomes may be variable and thus impact the quality of life of the recipients. With regard to the cellular and EV components, there has to be a match between the application (i.e., treating an acute injury vs a chronic degenerative condition) and the source and characteristics of the cells and the cargo of the EVs. Although the emerging literature appears to indicate that the generation of EVs is an important mechanism by which MSCs, as regulatory cells, facilitate tissue repair, what the role of the “stemness” characteristics of these cells in vivo remains to be fully characterized and should be the focus of further study. Perhaps the “stemness” allows for the lineage-specific generation of EVs with specialized cargo to target endogenous cells in unique environments, as indicated by the results of Winston et al. [113].",
        "With respect to the implantation environment, the inflammation and inflammatory background of the environment are likely a critical element that needs to be regulated. In the case of chronic degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, based on the findings indicating that the implanted materials appear to activate endogenous cells to facilitate repair [73], there needs to be sufficient endogenous tissue available to accomplish the repair goal. This means that repair using cellular therapy should be considered early after diagnosis rather than after the degeneration is very advanced. This scenario of an optimal cellular therapeutic vehicle coupled with an optimal implantation environment likely means that effective treatment will become personalized, and that the outcome expectations will be managed at the individual level. Furthermore, the presence of comorbidities and conditions that can influence outcomes should be considered when attempting to optimize the implantation environment. Continued progress towards achieving this dual goal should lead to enhanced outcomes going forward.",

        "Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease involving the progressive degeneration of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone, accompanied by synovitis [1]. Current treatment options for articular cartilage injury and osteoarthritis are aimed to relieve inflammation and pain, but have no effect on the natural progression of the disease [2]. Mesenchymal stromal cells are a promising option to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA) where, to date, knee arthroplasty is the only therapeutic option [3]. In the short term, the safety and usefulness of single injection of expanded autologous MSCs have been reported with positive results [4–6]. However, long-term results on the efficacy of MSCs in patients with osteoarthritis have been scarcely reported. Reservations about the time and extent of the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs are present, questioning the real value of these therapies in the medium and long term.",

There are some questions that would need further analysis, especially if a high dose of cells is needed and if the repeated intraaticular injection of BM-MSC may increase clinical results. In any case these results support the development of future phase III clinical trial.",

    "title": "What is the optimal dose of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells treatment for knee osteoarthritis? A conventional and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. and safety of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) therapy in knee osteoarthritis (KOA), no article has recently reviewed the cell dosage. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of varying doses of AD-MSCs in treating KOA using conventional and network meta-analysis. METHODS: A search of databases in in Chinese and English was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) on MSCs for knee osteoarthritis from the inception date to May 1, 2022. This study mainly analyzed the efficacy of AD-MSCs in the treatment of KOA, and subgroup analysis was performed on the therapeutic effects of MSCs from different tissues at the same dose. We divided the different cell doses into low, moderate, and high groups, with the corresponding cell doses: (0-25)*10;6, (25-50)*10;6, and > 50*10;6 cells, respectively. We further analyzed the improvement of improvement of the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores and the incidence of adverse events (AEs) after varied dosage injection. RESULTS: A total of 16 literatures were included in this study, of which 8 literatures were about AD-MSCs. Conventional meta-analysis suggests that AD-MSCs can reduce pain and improve function in KOA patients, regardless of the cell doses, up to 12 months of follow-up. The network meta-analysis showed that intra-articular injection of AD-MSCs significantly improved pain and knee function scores in KOA patients compared with the control group at 3, 6, and 12 months. Among the three groups, the high-dose group had the best treatment effect, and the degree of joint pain and dysfunction indicators improved more significantly in the early stage. For adverse events, there was a dose-response trend that increased with increasing doses. CONCLUSIONS: Both cell doses reduced pain and improved knee function in KOA patients. The effect surpassed in the high-dose group than in the moderate-dose, low-dose and control groups. However, adverse events also increase with the increase in dose, which should be carefully considered in clinical application, and the side effects still need to be paid attention to. Considering the limitations of this meta-analysis, future studies need to further explore the efficacy and safety of different doses of treatment, and carry out large sample, multi-center, randomized controlled trials to ensure the reliability and promotion value of the research results.

        "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a chronic disabling condition common in middle-aged and older people, characterized by symptoms such as pain, knee joint swelling, and restricted mobility [1]. Studies have shown that in adults aged 60 years or older, the prevalence of KOA is approximately 10% in males and 13% in females, with over 250 million individuals worldwide being affected by this condition [2]. Moreover, younger demographics are showing an escalation in the disease's incidence [3]. At present, the clinical treatment of OA mainly includes conservative treatments and surgical interventions. Conservative treatments include anti-inflammatory analgesics, intra-articular injections of hormone or sodium hyaluronate, rehabilitation physiotherapy, etc., which can relieve pain and mitigate symptoms. However, the benefits are temporary, and it is difficult to prevent or control the OA progression [4, 5], so that the disease is progressively aggravated, and finally surgical treatment is necessary. Surgical treatment is a palliative intervention for end-stage OA, which is not suitable for young patients and the elderly who cannot tolerate surgery. In addition, the life of artificial joints is limited, and there are many postoperative complications. Therefore, the prominent imperative is to develop effective treatments that simultaneously manage common symptoms and slow down KOA progression.",
        "In recent years, intra-articular injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has received extensive attention due to its immunomodulatory potential, offering a promising avenue toward decelerating the KOA development. MSCs derive from various sources. At present, the common MSCs that have been used in clinical trials of KOA include Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs), Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), and Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs). Clinical trials showed favored results [6–9].",
        "However, there are no standards for the dose of MSCs used in clinical trials. Different research teams using the same cell source vary the number of cells from 106 to 108, and the optimal dose remains unknown. Therefore, we need to establish an accurate, effective, and standardized treatment protocol to choose different MSC sources of MSCs and their injection doses. The differences in biological functions such as surface markers, immunophenotype, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of MSCs from different tissues may affect the therapeutic effect. Therefore, this study mainly focused on AD-MSCs, which have the most abundant tissue sources and are the most widely used. In addition, we divided different doses of AD-MSCs into three groups, high, moderate, and low, to verify the effectiveness of different doses in the treatment of KOA by conventional meta-analysis. At the same time, due to the lack of direct comparative evidence on different doses of MSCs, their effects were indirectly compared using network meta-analysis to provide evidence for the optimal cell dose for current KOA treatment.",
        "This article mainly analyzes the efficacy of different doses of AD-MSCs in the treatment of KOA. In order to conduct a subgroup analysis of the therapeutic effect of MSCs from different tissues under the same dose, the literature related to UC-MSCs and BM-MSCs was included. This systematic review was completed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement [10]. A meta-analysis of published literature was performed, which did not require the approval of an ethics committee. In addition, the meta-analysis protocol has been submitted to PROSPERO under registration number CRD42022378457.",
        "We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wan Fang, and VIP for relevant studies from inception to May 1, 2022, limited to papers related to the treatment of KOA by MSCs via joint injection. In addition, for a comprehensive search, all relevant articles in English and Chinese were searched, and relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were retrieved from clinical trial reports or review references.",

The complete search strategy is provided in Appendix 1.",
        "The inclusion and exclusion process followed the PICOS (Participants, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Study) principle. (1) Participants: adult patients diagnosed with primary knee osteoarthritis according to the guidelines formulated by the American Rheumatology Society or the Chinese Orthopaedic Association. (2) Intervention: the experimental group only received a single injection of MSCs into the knee joint. Those who received multiple injections or other routes of administration were excluded. The cell doses were divided into low, moderate, and high groups, and the corresponding cell doses were as follows: (0 < cells ≤ 25)*10^6, (25 < cells ≤ 50)*10^6, and cells > 50*10^6 respectively. (3) Comparison: The control group was treated with intra-articular injection of either normal saline, hormone, sodium hyaluronate, and cell culture medium and was represented as \"Standard\". (4) Outcome: at least one of Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and Adverse Events (AEs) were included in the article. (5) Study: Chinese or English randomized controlled trials without the restriction of publication year. (6) Exclusion criteria included: a. Patients with intra-segmental fractures or cruciate ligament injuries; b. Articles of poor quality, duplicate publication, and incomplete data; c. Reviews, case reports, conference papers, and animal experiments.",
        "To ensure the accuracy and reliability of data extraction, two researchers independently read the titles and abstracts and excluded articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria. The full text was then read to screen out eligible articles further. A unified data extraction table was designed. The extracted information mainly included title, first author, publication year, country, sample size, mean age, intervention methods, follow-up period, and outcome indicators. In case of disagreement, the decision was discussed with a third researcher. All continuous variables are expressed as mean ± SD. If the mean value or standard deviation of the study results were not provided, median, IQR, SE, P value, and 95% CI value in the Cochrane handbook were used to calculate the mean and standard deviation [11].",
        "Two investigators independently evaluated the literature and performed a preliminary screening according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The third researcher judged the literature with dissent, resolved the differences raised by the earlier researchers, and finally discussed and reached a consensus. The quality of the final included literature was assessed using the Cochrane tool for assessing the risk of bias [11]. The evaluation included the following seven aspects: ① random sequence generation; ② allocation concealment; ③ blinding of participants and personnel; ④ blinding of outcome assessment; ⑤ incomplete outcome data; ⑥ selective reporting and other bias. These points were graded as low risk, unclear, and high risk.",
        "The primary outcomes include ① WOMAC of 3, 6, and 12 months; ② VAS of 3, 6, and 12 months; ③ Occurrence of adverse events. Based on the different control groups used in various kinds of literature, the WOMAC and VAS scores before treatment in the experimental group were used as the common control group to reduce the source of heterogeneity.",
        "Conventional meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4 to verify the efficacy of three doses of AD-MACs in treating KOA. The VAS scores of MSCs derived from different tissues at the same intervention dose were analyzed in subgroups. Chi-squared test was used to evaluate the statistical heterogeneity among the studies. I2 was used to assess literature heterogeneity; I2 > 50% suggested high heterogeneity, and the random effects model was used, and when I2 ≤ 50% indicated lesser heterogeneity, the fixed effects model was used. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% credible intervals (CI) were used for continuous variables. No statistical significance was considered if 0 was included in the 95% confidence interval. Funnel plots were used to assess publication bias.",
        "Network Meta-analysis: Frequency network meta-analysis was performed in Stata 16.0 software to analyze the differences in the efficacy of three different cell doses. The surface area under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) was used to rank the results of interventions. A SUCRA score closer to 100% indicates a better therapeutic effect of the intervention. P < 0.05 was considered significant. A funnel plot was made for the outcome indicators to evaluate publication bias and small sample effect.",
        "A preliminary search identified 1280 relevant articles for this study. After thoroughly screening each layer, 16 randomized controlled trials were finally selected, including 14 in English and 2 in Chinese. Among them, 8 articles related to AD-MSCs, 5 articles related to BM-MSCs, and 3 articles related to UC-MSCs.

        "A total of 16 RCTs were included in this study, of which 8 RCTs pertain to AD-MSCs, encompassing 15 experimental groups and 192 KOA patients. The conventional meta-analysis was used to analyze the effect of different doses of AD-MSCs on KOA, and the efficacy of different doses of AD-MSCs was ranked by network meta-analysis. It was found that AD-MSCs significantly improve the pain and knee function scores of KOA patients in the 3,6, and 12-month follow-ups compared with control group, and the therapeutic effects of different doses are different, with the high-dose group showing the best therapeutic effect. Therefore, in practical treatment, it is more recommended to use high doses of AD-MSCs for better therapeutic effects. The results of this network meta-analysis are consistent with those of other studies, showing that the treatment effect of the high-dose group is better than that of the moderate and low-dose groups. For example, Jo et al. [17] found that the efficacy of high-dose AD-MSCs (100 × 10^6) was better than that of low-dose (10 × 10^6) and moderate-dose (50 × 10^6), which could significantly improve the pain and joint function of patients. From Fig. 15, we can see that the improvement of VAS and WOMAC in the high-dose group was most significant at 3 and 6 months, while it was similar to that in the moderate-dose group and low-dose group at 12 months. We believe that VAS and WOMAC are subjective evaluation indicators, and high doses can relieve the symptoms in a short time, with high early satisfaction. However, with the time moving forward, the occurrence of knee pain symptoms in the high-dose group magnified the patients' sensitivity, so the sense of fall was significantly higher than that in the moderate and low-dose groups. Of note, our results showed that the incidence of adverse events was positively correlated with the cell dose, and the adverse reactions were mostly pain and swelling at the injection site in the first few days after intra-articular injection. No serious adverse reactions were reported. If the side effects are considered, low or moderate-dose may be considered.",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with the potential to self-renew and differentiate into different cell types, which have been widely used in the treatment of various diseases. KOA is a disease of the joints characterized by damage and inflammation of the joint cartilage. MSCs can be used to treat knee inflammation through a variety of mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory, cartilage tissue repair, reducing apoptosis and promoting angiogenesis [28, 29]. Specifically, MSCs can secrete many anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, TGF-β and IL-1Ra, which can inhibit the inflammatory response and reduce the symptoms of knee arthritis. In addition, MSCs can differentiate into chondrocytes and secrete a large number of cartilage matrix components to help repair damaged cartilage tissue. MSCs can also promote joint tissue repair by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting angiogenesis. In conclusion, MSCs play a role in the treatment of KOA through multiple mechanisms, which can promote cartilage repair and regeneration, inhibit inflammatory response, regulate the immune system and promote angiogenesis, thereby reducing pain and improving joint function.",
        "The extensive use of MSCs intra-articular injection in the treatment of KOA has corroborated its efficacy [30]. However, the clinical application of MSCs still contends with two primary practical issues: the tissue source of MSCs and the standardization of cell injection dose. In recent years, a growing body of research has elucidated the efficacy of MSCs from different tissue sources in treating KOA. For example, a network meta-analysis by Wei et al. [8] showed that AD-MSCs were the most effective in relieving pain among all MSCs. At the same time, UC-MSCs were the most effective in functional improvement [8]. Jeyaraman et al. [7] showed through meta-analysis that AD-MSCs are more effective inimproving the VAS and WOMAC scores of KOA patients than BM-MSCs. Basic research experiments have demonstrated AD-MSCs to have more vital proliferation ability and tolerance to hypoxia in the joint cavity than BM-MSCs [31]. Moreover, in vitro expansion experiments, have confirmed that AD-MSCs are more advanced in genetic stability than BM-MSCs [32]. Toward investigating the second problem, there is still insufficient clinical evidence to prove the standard therapeutic dose. To our knowledge, network meta-analyses on varying doses of MSCs in treating KOA are lacking. Only some conventional meta-analyses have mentioned the efficacy of varying doses of MSCs in subgroup analysis [9]. Therefore, this paper summarizes the cell doses, divided into three groups, required by previous studies in treating KOA with MSCs, by directly or indirectly comparing the therapeutic effects of different cell doses.",
        "Treating KOA with adipose-derived MSCs began in 2014 [33]. Adipose tissue is increasingly used as a source of MSCs, benefited from its easy availability and ability to produce a large number of relatively uniform MSCs, making it an ideal choice for clinical applications. Therefore, the current treatment of KOA with MSCs is mainly from adipose tissue, and a large number of clinical evidences have accumulated to confirm the efficacy of AD-MSCs in the treatment of KOA, which is the reason why AD-MSCs were selected for network meta-analysis.",
        "This paper carries out network meta-analysis, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional meta-analysis that fails to compare multiple treatment groups simultaneously. However, it has certain limitations. This study only included all RCTs, single-center, and small sample clinical studies and lacked multi-center and large sample size trials. Standard cell injection doses are still lacking in clinical practice. In this study, we divided the cell doses into low, moderate, and high levels, which hinders us from obtaining a standardized and individualized treatment plan. Other factors, such as the age of patients and severity of disease, may also affect the therapeutic effect. Most of the studies included patients with Kellgren–Lawrence grade 2–3, and a small number of studies included patients with Kellgren–Lawrence grade 4 [14, 15]. Moreover, the majority of these studies focused on patients with a mean age ranging from 50 to 65, whereas a small number involved patients over the mean age of 65. It remains unclear whether OA patients with different Kellgren–Lawrence grade and age groups share different responsiveness to MSCs treatment. Notably, we included different strategies for identifying MSCs in the literature (Table 2). The majority of the studies used the classical surface marker for identification (CD73, CD90, CD105), while fewer studies used differentiation experiments for tangible validation. This lack of characterization may create potential heterogeneity in cell origin and provide additional bias to our meta-analysis. Future clinical studies may need to enhance the identification of MSCs to meet uniform standards [34]. However, differentiation assays in vitro and in vivo often require an additional 2–3 weeks to perform, which may be difficult to achieve in clinical practice. In addition, the standardization of the cell preparation and production process would also affect the therapeutic effect of MSCs in patients, which is where clinical studies differ from preclinical studies. Our analysis indicated that some studies adhered to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance (Table 2). However, others tended to rely on third-party companies for preparation [19], which might necessitate additional transit for the tissues, while some studies had onsite lab to conduct the extraction [12]. These may affect the therapeutic effect of the cells and thus create dosage heterogeneity. We were unable to perform additional subgroup analyses based on cell preparation methods or characterization criteria, which may be an additional limitation of our study.Table 2Characterization and preparation methods of the MSCsReferencesStudyCountryOriginCharacterization standardsPreparation methods(location, method)Compliance with GMP standards[11]Freitag et al., (1) 2019AustraliaAD-MSCsSurface marker (s CD90+, CD73+, CD 105+, CD14−, CD19−, CD34−, CD45−)Onsite laboratory,Enzymatic digestion[12]Garza et al., (1) 2020USAAD-MSCsSurface marker (CD45−, CD31−, CD34+)N.A,Enzymatic digestion[13]Koh et al., 2012South KoreaAD-MSCsNOOperating room,Enzymatic digestion[14]Lee et al., 2019South KoreaAD-MSCsSurface marker (purity: CD31, CD34, CD45; identity: CD73, CD90)Laboratory,Enzymatic digestion[15]Lu et al., 2019ChinaAD-MSCsSurface marker (Cd105+, CD73+, CD90+, CD45−, CD34−, CD14−, CD11b−, CD79a−, CD19−, HLA II−)Laboratory,Medium cultureYes[16]Jo et al., 2017KoreaAD-MSCsSurface marker (CD31, CD34, CD45; identity: CD73, CD90)N.A,N.

        "Sixteen literatures were included in this study, eight of which were related to AD-MSCs in the treatment of KOA. Overall, it was found that both cell doses reduced pain and improved knee function in KOA patients and were significantly better than those in the control group. It was noted that superior results were achieved by the high-dose group in comparison to the moderate and low-dose groups, and the patients' pain and dysfunction indicators improved more significantly in the early stage. The high-dose group typically used twice as many cells or more than the moderate-dose group. Therefore, an ample cell doses may yield a greater therapeutic effect on KOA. In conclusion, the results of this network meta-analysis indicate that AD-MSCs is a promising treatment for knee OA, but it needs to be carefully considered in clinical application, and the potential risks and side effects still need to be noted. Due to the limitations of this meta-analysis, future studies need to further explore the efficacy and safety of different doses, and carry out large sample, multi-center, randomized controlled trials to ensure the reliability and promotion value of the research results.",

However, their efficacy, optimal dose and addition of adjuvants must be determined. Here, we evaluated the clinical effects of a dose of 100 x 10(6) bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) in combination with Platelet Rich Plasma (PRGF(R)) as adjuvant in a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: A phase II, multicenter, randomized clinical trial with active control was conducted. Sixty patients diagnosed with knee OA were randomly assigned to 3 weekly doses of PRGF(R) or intraarticular administration of 100 x 10(6) cultured autologous BM-MSCs plus PRGF(R). Patients were followed up for 12 months, and pain and function were assessed using VAS and WOMAC and by measuring the knee range of motion range. X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging analyses were performed to analyze joint damage. RESULTS: No adverse effects were reported after BM-MSC administration or during follow-up. According to VAS, the mean value (SD) for PRGF(R) and BM-MSC with PRGF(R) went from 5 (1.8) to 4.5 (2.2) (p = 0.389) and from 5.3 (1.9) to 3.5 (2.5) (p = 0.01), respectively at 12 months. In WOMAC, the mean (SD) baseline and 12-month overall WOMAC scores in patients treated with PRGF(R) was 31.9 (16.2) and 22.3 (15.8) respectively (p = 0.002) while that for patients treated with BM-MSC plus PRGF(R) was 33.4 (18.7) and 23.0 (16.6) (p = 0.053). Although statistical significances between groups have been not detected, only patients being treated with BM-MSC plus PRGF(R) could be considered as a OA treatment responders following OARSI criteria. X-ray and MRI (WORMS protocol) revealed no changes in knee joint space width or joint damage. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with BM-MSC associated with PRGF(R) was shown to be a viable therapeutic option for osteoarthritis of the knee, with clinical improvement at the end of follow-up.

        "Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) occurs in 10% of men and 13% of women aged 60 years or older and is increasing significantly because the aging population [1, 2]. To date, total knee arthroplasty is the definitive treatment for advanced grade of symptomatic OA [3].",
        "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) offer some interesting properties that could be useful for treating OA [4]. Because OA is the result of an inflammatory pathophysiology, with the presence of inflammatory cells, the modulation of the immunological responses and the expression of inflammatory mediators by MSCs present a major therapeutic potential [4–7] providing the theoretical basis for the exogenous administration of MSC to be effective. It has been suggested that the number of MSC in subchondral bone decreases with age and correlates with OA degree, and that this deficit is necessary for the development of the degenerative process [8–13]. In addition, it has been proposed that during tissue injury the reparative process requires the migration of MSCs to the site of injury to exert their effects [14, 15].",
        "Although treatment with MSCs in knee OA has been shown as a safe and feasible procedure in numerous phase I and II clinical trials, there are still doubts about its efficacy, mechanism of action, dosing and use of adjuvants [16–19]. Thus, the good preliminary results in safety have encouraged clinicians to conduct clinical trials focused on the efficacy of MSCs.",
        "The use of platelet rich plasma (PRP) in orthopedic surgery is growing for the treatment of osteoarthritis [20, 21]. However, due to the different methods of production standardization is difficult and there is an open debate concerning the interpretation of the research on PRP [21, 22]. In any case, the identification of PRP-derived anabolic growth factors (basic FGF, TGF-β1, TGF-β2, EGF, IGF-I, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, VEGF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1ra, sTNF-R1, sTNF-RII, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, IFNγ) may present therapeutic potential in the treatment of osteoarthritis, especially in combination with MSCs, through enhancing or preserving their regenerative properties [23–25]. In addition, a positive effect on joint lubrication through stimulation of synoviocytes-derived hyaluronic acid has been reported for PRP, thus, when administered as co-adjuvant of MSCs, PRP could increase the intra-articular retention and survival of MSCs in an anti-inflammatory environment [26, 27].",
        "Despite the existence and availability of these two promising biological treatments, little is known about the clinical effect of the combination of the two. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of intraarticular injection of 100 million bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) in combination with autologous PRP (PRGF®) in the treatment of OA.",
        "This is a phase II randomized clinical trial with active control conducted between August 2016 and July 2018, involving the Clínica Universidad de Navarra (Pamplona, Spain); IBSAL-Hospital Universitario de Salamanca (Salamanca, Spain) and Hospital Vithas San José (Vitoria, Spain). All the procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Navarra and the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (Nº EudraCT: 2011-006036-23, Clinical Trials.gov identifier: NCT02365142) an Ethics Commite for Clinical Research of Navarra, Salamanca and País Vasco.

        "Patients were randomly assigned to receive either PRGF® or BM-MSC and PRGF® treatment with allocation as per a computer-generated randomization schedule. This allocation procedure was centralized to ensure that no center knew the treatment allocation of any patient until the patient had been recruited into the trial. The biopsy linked to the use of autologous cells did not allow any blinding procedure for patients nor clinicians for ethical reasons. Blinding processes were carried out for imaging evaluation and statistical analysis. The control group was constituted by patients who received PRGF® as a weekly single intra-articular injection of PRGF®, final volume of 8 ml, for 3 weeks. The BM-MSCs group was formed by patients who received a single intra-articular injection of 100 × 106 autologous cultured BM-MSCs in 3 ml Ringer’s lactate solution, followed by an intraarticular injection of 8 ml of PRGF®. A weekly single intra-articular injection of PRGF®, in a final volume of 8 ml, was applied for 2 additional weeks.",

        "BM-MSCs were generated under good manufacturing practice conditions (GMP) with standard operating procedures as previously described [28]. Briefly, bone marrow (100 ml) was harvested from the pelvic bone (iliac crest) under sterile conditions. The mononuclear cell fraction was isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Mononuclear cells, ranging between 20 × 106 and 60 × 106, were subsequently seeded in 175 cm2 flasks with growth medium, which consisted of αMEM without ribonucleosides (Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 5% platelet lysate, 2 units/ml heparin, penicillin–streptomycin at 1% (Gibco, Life Technologies) and 1 ng/ml human fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The flasks were maintained in culture at 37ºC in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The growth medium was changed every 3–4 days. About 10–15 days later, colonies were formed, and the cells were split with TrypLE Select™ (Life Technologies) and seeded at 3000–5000 cells/cm2. Once 70–80% confluence was reached, cells were split again and cultured until they were available in the amounts required to be administered to patients. Finally, cells were harvested with TrypLE Select™, washed three times with PBS and resuspended in Ringer’s lactate buffer (Grifols, Barcelona, Spain) containing 1% human albumin (Grifols), to be administered within 24 h of harvesting of the cells. Cells were characterized according to ISCT criteria. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San José, CA, USA) with the appropriate antibodies (BD Biosciences) to confirm expression of surface markers CD90, CD73 and CD44, as well as absence of CD34 and CD45.",
        "PRGF® was obtained with PRGF-Endoret (BTI System II; BTI Biotechnology Institute, Vitoria, Spain) by centrifugation at 580×g for 8 min at room temperature. The top volume of plasma, with a platelet count similar to peripheral blood, was not used. The plasma fraction, located just above the sedimented red blood cells but not including the buffy coat, was collected in another tube. This plasma contains a moderate enrichment in platelets (two to threefold the platelet count of the peripheral blood) with no leukocytes. Thereafter, in the injection room 10% Calcium Chloride was added to activate platelets (0.05 ml of calcium chloride per ml PRP).",
        "Cell and PRGF® injection were performed through a lateral patellar approach as previously reported [18]. For cell treatment, cell injection was applied 3–4 weeks after the iliac crest biopsy had been performed. In all of the patients, cells were administered within the first hour after harvesting. For this purpose, a 19 G needle was used in two consecutive intraarticular injections. In the first one, 100 × 106 BM-MSCs were administered in 3 ml of Ringer lactate. Subsequently, 8 ml of PRGF® were injected using the same route. In the PRGF®-only group, 3 separate doses were applied, one week each, 8 ml of PRP per injection.",
        "The clinical response to intra-articular infusion of both treatments was assessed using the following procedures:",
        "To clinically assess pain and function, two scale-based methods, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Likert version of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), were evaluated at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment [29, 30]. VAS ranges from 0 (maximum relief, i.e. no pain) to 10 (no relief, i.e. maximal pain). WOMAC comprises three sub scores, pain, which includes 5 items; stiffness, with 2 items; and physical function, with 17 items. According to Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI), patients were considered WOMAC responders when they reported an improvement of 20% on at least 2 items together with an improvement of 10 points in the overall scale [31].",
        "To provide a radiographic assessment of the joint space width, Rosenberg X-ray projections were taken at baseline and 12 months afterwards. A custom methacrylate patient positioner was used to achieve a comparative view as previously described [28].",
        "A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study was carried out at baseline and 12 months after treatment. One experienced radiologist evaluated MRI images in a blinded manner by assessing the number and location of the lesions, cartilage thickness, signal intensity, and subchondral bone alteration and volume, following the Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) protocol, in which higher score values indicate more damage [32]. Three Tesla Magnetom TRIO equipment (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) was used following a protocol which included an axial T1 weighted spin‐echo (SE) (TR 700 ms/TE 11 ms) slice thickness (ST) of 4 mm; coronal T1 weighted SE (TR 700 ms/TE 11 ms) ST of 4 mm; SPACE sagittalT1 weighted (TR 800 ms/TE 43 ms) ST of 0.7 mm; 2D Intermediate weighted (IW) Fat Saturation (FS) Sagittal (TR 4620 ms/TE 21 ms) ST 3 mm; Coronal 2D IW (TR 4370 ms/TE 11 ms) ST 3 mm and sagittal T2* 2D (MapIt TR 958 ms, TE 4, 11, 18, 25 y 32 ms) ST 3 mm.",
        "The predefined analysis strategy was by intention to treat. Data were summarized using means and standard deviations (SD), medians and percentiles 25 (p25) and 75 (p75), and counts and percentages. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to test the normality assumption. For comparisons, we used the unpaired Student’s t test, the Mann–Whitney U test, the paired Student’s t test, and the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, as appropriate. All tests were two-tailed. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All the statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14 (Stata Corp. 2015.

Articular pain requiring anti-inflammatory treatment during the first 24 h after infiltration was observed in six patients in BM-MSC plus PRGF® group (five after the administration of BM-MSC plus PRGF and one after the third PRGF® injection). All patients recovered completely without sequelae.",
        "The assessment of pain by VAS showed an improvement in pain when compared with baseline in both groups. This improvement in pain level was more evident for the BM-MSC plus PRGF® group. The mean (SD) baseline and 12-month VAS scores in patients receiving PRGF® was 5 (1.8) and 4.5 (2.2), respectively (p > 0.05). For the BM-MSC plus PRGF®, the mean (SD) baseline and 12-month VAS scores were 5.3 (1.9) and 3.5 (2.5), respectively (p = 0.01). The median (p25; p75) of percentage reduction in VAS from baseline to 12 months was 39.2% (− 67%; 0%) for BM-MSC plus PRGF® group whereas it was 12.5% (− 29%; 40%) for PRGF® group (p = 0.082) (Table 2). Although this improvement was higher with the BM-MSC plus PRGF® treatment, the differences in pain assessment by VAS did not show statistically significant differences between PRGF® and BM-MSC plus PRGF® at any time points. Similar results were observed in the WOMAC score with an improvement in the overall WOMAC score observed at the different time points in comparison with the baseline value in both groups (Table 3). The mean (SD) baseline and 12-month overall WOMAC scores in patients treated with PRGF® were 31.9 (16.2) and 22.3 (15.8), respectively (p = 0.002) and 33.4 (18.7) and 23.0 (16.6) for patients treated with BM-MSC plus PRGF® at baseline (n = 24) and 12-month (n = 21) respectively (p = 0.053). The median (p25; p75) WOMAC score reductions from baseline to 12 months were 37.3% (− 80%; 8%) and 23.4% (− 63%; 6.5%) for BM-MSC plus PRGF® group and PRGF® group, respectively with no significant differences between groups (p = 0.691). The Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) defined treatment response in patients with OA is defined as an improvement greater than 20 percent on at least 2 items evaluated at 12 months and a difference greater than 10 points overall. According to this definition and the results showed, only patients being treated with BM-MSC plus PRGF® could be considered as treatment responders.Table 2VAS before administration of treatments and 3, 6 and 12 months afterwardsTimePRPBM-MSCs + PRPBaseline5 (1.8)5.3 (1.9)3 months3.8 (1.6)*3.8 (2)*6 months3.5 (2)*3.3 (2.2)*12 months4.5 (2.2)3.5 (2.5)**Data are presented as mean (SD).

        "The X-rays analysis of the knee joint space during follow up did not show any clinical effect (Additional file 1: Table S1). Because fifty per cent of the patients have a knee joint space baseline value of 0 mm (no joint space), detection of a clinical effect by X-ray imaging has certain limitations. Consistent with the X-ray results, the analysis of the MRI following the WORMS protocol did not show any significant change during follow up (Additional file 2: Table S2).",
        "We present the results of a phase II clinical trial that followed a previous phase I clinical trial focused primarily on safety and feasibility, with promising secondary efficacy results using a dose of autologous 100 million BM-MSCs, and with a clinical improvement that remained in long-term follow-up [18, 33].",
        "The use of co-adjuvants with BM-MSCs in the treatment of OA is a topic of interest. Some authors report functional and clinical improvement without the use of coadjuvants, and others report clinical improvement with the use of HA as an adjuvant for BM-MSCs, while the use of PRP as adjuvant is still controversial [28, 33, 34]. The clinical results published without co-adjuvants seems to be comparable with our results using BM-MSC and PRGF®. However, further analysis are needed in that sense.",
        "Preclinical studies showed that PRP could be used as a potent and reliable chondrogenic inducer as a substitute for TGF-β1. Some of its properties, such as its low immunogenicity, easy accessibility and role as an activator of the mechanism of hyaline cartilage production (related with the TGF-β1/SMAD signaling pathway) define the PRP as a potentially attractive coadjuvant [35, 36]. Reporting a clinical study with 18 patients, Bastos et al. concluded that the use of PRP as co-adjuvant together with 40 million BM-MSCs did not provide additional benefits over the use of BM-MSCs alone [37]. The same group, in a recent clinical trial, compared the use of 40 million BM-MSCs (n = 14) with and without PRP (n = 16) and corticosteroids (n = 17) as standard control treatment, no differences were observed in the use of adjuvant therapy with PRP in the treatment of these patients [17]. Interestingly, Bastos et al. reported the use of a white blood cell-depleted PRP (< 0.3% from the initial red blood cells and leukocytes were present) containing between 5.4- to 7.3-fold increase in platelet concentration (1.4 × 106 to 1.9 × 106 platelets/μl). It differs in some aspect to PRGF® which presents a moderate enrichment in platelets (two to threefold the platelet count of the peripheral blood) with no leukocytes. In consequence, the use of different products and the adjuvant effect over the BM-MSC could not be the same and the difference observed in our study could be a consequence of these variations [37].",
        "PRGF® is a type of PRP that presents a number of characteristics that differentiate it from other blood products. The main characteristics that define it are its concentration of platelets two to threefold higher than the levels in blood and the absence of leukocytes. This makes PRGF® a type of PRP that is poor in leukocytes, which are increasingly recommended for treating pathologies such as osteoarthritis, since promotes extracellular matrix repair, decreases inflammation, and slow-down joint degeneration [38].",
        "Furthermore, the presence of leukocytes leads to an increase in the levels of proinflammatory molecules that can influence not only the development of the pathology [39] but also harm the MSCs that are administered [40]. In an in vivo study, Dregalla et al. compared the response of bone marrow derived human mesenchymal stem cells cultured in different types of PRP. The authors observed that PRP without leukocites increased cell proliferation and hyaluronic acid synthesis compared with leukocyte-rich PRP [41].",
        "The use of PRGF® with adjuvant cell products was studied in dogs with hip osteoarthritis which received PRGF® and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell. The results demonstrated that the treatment was safe and effective, significantly improving aspects such as peak vertical force and vertical impulse [42].",
        "As in our previous clinical trial, we detected no regenerative effect after the administration of BM-MSCs, even after the use of T2-Mapping sequence. We were capable of detecting positive clinical effects when pain was evaluated. In that sense, Caplan et al. proposed a change in the name of MSCs from mesenchymal stromal cells to medicinal signaling cells [4, 43]. This change in nomenclature is explained because paracrine effects of MSCs on inflammatory cells, and recently a decreased level of inflammatory cytokines (IL-17α, IL-10 and TNF-α) with the administration of BM-MSC have been reported [17]. Futures studies should focus on the lower OA grades to delimit the paracrine effects of biological treatments in chondrocytes. We should note that 50% of the patients presented the higher degree of OA (grade IV), so the expected combined paracrine effect of PRGF® and BM-MSCs over the chondrocytes was not predictable, due to the scarce number of viable chondrocytes in cartilage with advanced OA.",
        "Our study had several limitations. The interventions could not be blinded for patients nor clinicians for ethical reasons. Efforts to minimize potential biases were made using blinded imaging evaluators and a blinded process for statistical analysis. Although placebo effect may explain some degree of the treatment impact, it does not seem plausible that this phenomenon could entirely explain the clinical improvement of patients receiving BM-MSC plus PRGF®. Some authors have defined the placebo effect as a reduction of 1.37 points on the VAS scale and 9 on the WOMAC [44, 45]. We report here, at 12 months, that the decrease in the VAS scoring was 1.8 points, and 10.4 in WOMAC score. Saltzman et al. in a meta-analysis published in 2016 objectified the effect of the saline injection on the VAS and WOMAC scales at six months. They included 14 cohorts of 13 different studies in knee OA where patients were treated with a saline injection. A saline serum effect of 1.66 in VAS and 11.34 in WOMAC at six months was determined [46]. In our study, at 6 months, we detected a decrease on the VAS of 2.0 points and 12.1 points on the WOMAC in BM-MSC plus PRGF®. In addition, patients in the group receiving BM-MSCs plus PRGF® were the only ones that can be considered responders to the treatment, according to the definition of responder to treatment for osteoarthritis of the OARSI with an improvement greater than 20 percent on each item (the OARSI definition highlights an improvement of 20% on at least 2 items) evaluated at 12 months and a difference greater than 10 points overall. Overall, these results are consistent in the literature with the use of both allogeneic and autologous cultured BM-MSCs [6, 16, 19, 28, 34, 47].",
        "Treatment with BM-MSC associated with PRGF® has been shown to be a viable therapeutic option in the treatment of OA of the knee, resulting in improvement at the end of the follow-up in VAS and WOMAC score. Only patients being treated with BM-MSC plus PRGF® could be considered as OA treatment responders. PRGF® alone showed improvement in WOMAC but not in VAS score, however, magnitude clinical differences assessed between groups were not statistically significant. Therefore, further phase III clinical trials would be necessary to confirm the efficacy of the treatment.",

    "title": "The efficacy of different sources of mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Regenerative therapies using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide an option for OA treatment as it could potentially regenerate the damaged cartilage. Bone marrow, adipose tissue and synovium are common MSC sources. The aim is to compare the therapeutic effect of MSCs from bone marrow, adipose tissue and synovium; combining its differentiation potential and accessibility, to decide the optimal source of MSCs for the treatment of knee OA. A comparison of preclinical and clinical studies using MSCs has been made with regard to treatment outcomes, isolation procedure and differentiation potential. All types of MSCs are effective at improving the clinical and structural condition of OA patients, but the longevity of the treatment, i.e. an effect that is maintained for at least 2 years, cannot be guaranteed. This review highlighted great variations in selection criteria and culture expansion conditions of MSCs between the literature and clinical trials. It also emphasised a substantial diversity and lack of consistency in the assessment mythology of clinical outcome after completion of MSC therapies procedures. A more cohesive methodology is required to evaluate the outcome of MSC treatments using quantitative and standardised frameworks in order to be able to directly compare results. Larger population of patients are recommended to assess the quality of MSC when designing studies and clinical trials to reaffirm the efficacy of MSC treatment prior to and within the clinical trials and follow up studies.

        "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease worldwide, affecting approximately 10% of men and 18% of women over 60 years of age (Cao et al., 2024). There are multiple factors that contribute to the occurrence and progression of OA. It is characterized by gradual degeneration and exfoliation of the articular cartilage, as well as structural and functional changes in the joint as a whole, including the synovium, meniscus, periarticular ligaments, and subchondral bone (Ebada et al., 2022; Mobasheri and Batt, 2016). Currently, there are four main treatments for OA: physical therapy, such as weight loss and reducing joint damage; using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to relieve the patient’s pain; intra-articular (IA) injections of drugs such as sodium hyaluronate; and joint replacement surgery for patients with severe or advanced OA (Huang et al., 2022). However, current treatments are aimed at relieving patient symptoms such as localized swelling and pain, which do not effectively improve cartilage damage (Hochberg et al., 2012). In the past decade, cell therapy for OA has developed rapidly, in which stem cell therapy has achieved excellent results (Ruscitto et al., 2023; Song et al., 2020).",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have a strong differentiation potential, can be isolated and extracted from a variety of autologous and allogeneic sites such as bone marrow (BMMSCs), adipose tissue (ADMSC), umbilical cord blood and dental pulp. In fact, there have been relevant reports about clinical trials of bone marrow MSCs, adipose MSCs, and umbilical cord MSCs for the treatment of OA (Epanomeritakis and Khan, 2024; Matas et al., 2019; Shariatzadeh et al., 2019). However, there are still many difficulties to overcome in stem cell transplantation therapy, including the risk of tumor formation, ethical issues, and transplant rejection. iPSC-MSCs are constructed by transferring transcription factors such as Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4 into adult cells via lentiviral vectors, which transform them into pluripotent stem cells with embryonic stem cell-like functions (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006; Yu et al., 2007). It has the advantages of low immunogenicity and high proliferative capacity compared to other sources of MSCs. Our pre-experiment confirmed that iPSC-MSCs were used to treat a rat OA model and achieved favorable results, and the pathological analysis showed that it could repair cartilage damage and regenerate damaged cartilage. However, we are still unknown about the fate of iPSC-MSCs after injection into the joint cavity of osteoarthritis, including cell viability, cell distribution location, attachment tissue, and intra-articular retention period. The exploration of the pharmacokinetics of iPSC-MSCs after knee injections is essential for adjusting the administration regimen, understanding the pattern of cellular effects, improving the formulation, and improving therapeutic efficacy.",
        "It has been demonstrated that after MSCs with the luciferase gene were injected into the joint cavity, fluorescent signals could be observed at different time points. Moreover, the cells in the osteoarthritis group survived longer than those in the control group, suggesting that different joint cavity microenvironments affect cell metabolism and proliferation (Li et al., 2024). There is also direct evidence suggesting that MSCs are still acting locally, but their distribution within the joint cavity is unknown (Li et al., 2016). In vivo biofluorescence imaging refers to the utilization of luciferase genes expressed in animals to produce luciferase protease that reacts with the corresponding substrate to generate a light signal and then forms an image in vitro through sensitive charge-coupled device equipment (Yeh et al., 2017). The current cell labeling methods have drawbacks such as low sensitivity, low specificity, and dependence on gene-edited animals (He et al., 2023). Antares2 is an excellent bioluminescent reporter gene with a stable and long-lasting fluorescent signal, favorable biosafety, and high detection sensitivity (Hikita et al., 2020; Yeh et al., 2017). Currently, no relevant studies use the Antares2 luciferase reporter gene to observe the metabolic and distributional characteristics of iPSC-MSCs in rats.",
        "In this study, we injected Antares2-iMSCs into the knee joints of non-transgenic rats and then explored the metabolism and distribution of the cells by in vivo fluorescence imaging. Our previous work confirmed that iPSC-MSCs had a favorable therapeutic effect on OA rats by pathological analysis including, HE staining and immunohistochemistry. Exploring the distribution and metabolic change patterns of Antares2-iMSCs in different joint microenvironments is conducive to further optimizing stem cell therapy protocols, which provides the experimental basis for applying iPSC-MSCs in the clinical treatment of OA.",
        "The iPSC-MSCs (Lot No.: 202011006) and Antares2-iMSCs (Lot No.: 20201206) were purchased from Nuwacell Biotechnology Co (Hefei, China).

        "The operation was performed in a sterile SPF animal laboratory. First, the rats were anaesthetised with Zoletil 100 (100 g/0.1 mL) (Virbac, France). The left hind limb of the rats was shaved and disinfected with 75% alcohol, and then a 20 mm incision was made to expose the left knee joint.

However, the rats in the sham operation group did not destroy any ligaments or menisci after exposing the joint cavity.",
        "Forty rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10): sham operation group (single intra-articular injection of 50 μL saline), model group (single intra-articular injection of 50 μL saline), iPSC-MSCs group (single intra-articular injection of 50 μL saline containing 2.0 × 106 cells), and sodium hyaluronate (SH) group (intra-articular injection of 50 μL sodium hyaluronate containing 0.5 mg; weekly; five times).",
        "At the end of the experiment, the knee joints of the rats were collected for histopathological evaluation. Tissue sections of the knee joint were stained by hematoxylin and eosin to observe inflammatory cells, synovial infiltration, and cartilage damage. To assess the articular cartilage damage, the tissue sections of the knee joint were immunostained with antibodies against MMP-13 (diluted 1:200, ab219620, Abcam, United Kingdom), OPG (diluted 1:200, ab203061, Abcam, United Kingdom), type I collagen (diluted 1:200, abs120555, Absin, Shanghai, China), and type II collagen (diluted 1:100, ab34712, Abcam, United Kingdom), respectively.",

The number of MSCs in each group was calculated by high-content imaging to determine the value-added of Antares2-labeled MSCs and unlabeled MSCs.",
        "To determine the in vitro detection threshold, a 100 μL PBS suspension containing Antares2-iMSCs (106, 105, 104, 103, 0 cells) was first prepared. Then, 100 μL of the configured Diphenylterazine (DTZ, 2 mg/mL, MCE, China) solution was added to each EP tube and mixed well. At the same time, the same dose of Antares2-iMSCs was injected into the knee joint cavity of the rats, and then the configured 100 μL of DTZ solution (2 mg/mL) was injected into the rats through the tail vein. The rats were immediately scanned by a small animal live imager (Amix, Spectral Instruments Imaging, United States) to determine the detection threshold in vivo.

        "After 8 weeks of modelling, the Antares2-iMSCs were injected into the knee joint cavity of rats. The rat knee joint was injected with 50 μL of saline containing 2.0 × 106 cells. The rats were then randomly divided into six groups (n = 5): stem cell injection for 5 h; stem cell injection for 24 h; stem cell injection for 72 h; stem cell injection for 1 week; stem cell injection for 2 weeks; and stem cell injection for 6 weeks.",

Subsequently, 50 μL of DTZ (2 mg/mL) solution was added dropwise to the joint tissue, and the DTZ solution was removed from the tissue after 30 s. Finally, fluorescence imaging of joint tissue was performed using a small animal imaging system.",
        "The synovium, cartilage and meniscus embedded in the OCT were sliced into 3.5um thick sections using a frozen microtome (CM1950, Leica, Germany).

Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with FITC-CD90 antibody (BD Pharmingen, United States). Finally, the fluorescence signal of each group was detected by flow cytometry (BD FACSC anto, BD Biosciences, United States).",

        "Pathological changes of OA in rats were investigated by HE staining. Compared with the sham-operated group, the pathology of the knee in the model group showed the typical changes of OA, including severe cartilage destruction, disturbed chondrocyte arrangement and synovial infiltration into the cartilage layer (Figure 1). However, treatment with iPSC-MSCs significantly increased the thickness of the articular cartilage layer, increased the number of chondrocytes, and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration in the joint cavity. Compared with the sham-operated group, cartilage tissue in the model group showed remarkably higher expression of MMP-13 and type I collagen, whereas osteoprotegerin (OPG) and type II collagen were significantly reduced (Figure 1). In contrast, iPSC-MSCs reversed the above alterations, with expression levels close to those of the sham-operated group.",

        "After determining the detection threshold, our study further explored the metabolic characteristics of Antares2-iMSCs at therapeutic doses in the knee joint. Firstly, 2 × 106 Antares2-iMSCs were injected into the left knee joints of rats in the sham-operated group and the OA group, and the results showed that the fluorescence intensity was the strongest in the knee joints of the rats after 5 h and gradually decreased over time (Figure 3A). The results showed that the fluorescent signals disappeared in the sham-operated group 2 weeks after cell injection; however, the fluorescent signals of Antares2-iMSCs lasted longer in the model group of rats than in the sham-operated group (Figure 3B).

The overall trend of decreasing fluorescence intensity was smoother in the OA group compared to the sham-operated group. After 1 week, the fluorescence signals of all three tissues in the OA group were higher than those in the sham-operated group (Figures 4E–G). There was the highest fluorescence intensity in the synovial membrane of both the sham-operated group and the OA group, followed by the meniscus and cartilage (Figures 4B,D).

The expression of CD90 in the synovial fluid of the sham-operated and OA groups was highest at 5 h and gradually decreased over time, with the greatest decrease between 5 and 24 h (Supplementary Figure S4). The expression of CD90 in synovial fluid of the OA group (25.18% ± 6.42%) was higher than that of the sham-operated group (20.79% ± 1.87%) at 5 h (Figure 6).",
        "Detection of CD90 (iPSC-MSCs) expression levels in synovial fluid by flow cytometry.",
        "Many previous studies have shown that intra-articular injection of MSCs has promising efficacy in the treatment of OA (Lamo-Espinosa et al., 2020; Lamo-Espinosa et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2024). Our experimental results suggest that treatment with iPSC-MSCs can significantly improve cartilage damage (Figure 1). In addition, iPSC-MSCs could reduce the expression of MMP-13 and elevate the expression of OPG in the knee joint, which could inhibit cartilage degradation and slow down the progression of OA (Abshirini et al., 2021). The expression of type I collagen was significantly elevated in the articular cartilage of rats in the OA group. iPSC-MSCs administration elevated the expression of type II collagen in the cartilage of rats and promoted the recovery of cartilage matrix. As an alternative source of stem cells, iPSC-MSCs can be induced from patient-specific adult cells and have similar characteristics to embryonic stem cells in terms of morphology, self-renewal and differentiation ability (Yu et al., 2007). In addition, iPSC-MSCs have superiority over other sources of MSCs in terms of cell proliferation, immunomodulation, production of exosomes with regulatory functions, and secretion of biologically active cytokines (Abe et al., 2023; Rosochowicz et al., 2024). However, the distribution and metabolism of iPSC-MSCs in the joint cavity after injection have not yet been reported.",
        "In this study, Antares2 luciferase gene-labelled iPSC-MSCs were used as labelled cells, and DTZ was used as a luciferase substrate to study the metabolism and distribution of iPSC-MSCs in rats. Antares2, a BRET (bioluminescence resonance energy transfer)-based reporter, was created by inserting the fluorescent protein CyOFP1 into teLuc, which further improves bioluminescence detection in deep tissues (Yeh et al., 2017). Antares2-iMSCs as a new labelling method can be observed with strong fluorescence signals in the 695 ± 50 nm band by small animal in vivo imagers, which has the advantages of stable fluorescence signals and avoids spontaneous fluorescence in animals. Excitation of the external light source avoids the interference of the background signal from natural fluorescent substances, and possesses the characteristics of high specificity, excellent signal-to-noise ratio and extremely high sensitivity (Li et al., 2016). In addition, the results of the high-content proliferation assay showed that there was no significant difference in the proliferation of Antares2-iMSCs and iPSC-MSCs cultured for different time periods, suggesting that Antares2 labelling had no effect on the cellular activity of iPSC-MSCs (Supplementary Figure S1). Similarly, Antares2-iMSCs have a high detection sensitivity because the minimum detectable cell concentration is approximately 104 cells in vitro and 105 cells in vivo (Figure 2).",
        "It has been shown that MSCs maintain tissue homeostasis and repair through replacement of mature cells lost due to physiological renewal, aging, and injury (Wu et al., 2024). The fate of MSCs in the knee joint is still unknown, and we need to understand the survival time and distribution characteristics of MSCs in the joint. In this way, we can explore their therapeutic mechanisms. The experimental results showed that iPSC-MSCs persisted in the joint cavity over 2 weeks after local injection and did not migrate to other sites, providing direct evidence that iPSC-MSCs exert therapeutic effects and carry out tissue repair locally rather than systemically (Figure 3A). Compared with the sham-operated group, the fluorescence signals of Antares2-iMSCs lasted longer in the rats from the OA group, which may be related to the inflammatory microenvironment of OA. The cytokines secreted in the inflammatory microenvironment of OA can attract MSCs to homing and staying locally for longer time (Fan et al., 2023).",
        "Related studies have reported on the metabolism of synovial-derived MSCs in a knee meniscectomy model and showed that more synovial MSCs were attached to the meniscus in the model group compared to the control group (Baboolal et al., 2018). Therefore, we observed the distribution of iPSC-MSCs on tissues such as synovium, meniscus and cartilage in the joint cavity by fluorescence imaging and immunofluorescence (Figures 4, 5). The experimental results showed that iPSC-MSCs injected into the joint cavity were predominantly distributed in the synovium, followed by the meniscus and cartilage, and the cells were still detectable in the tissue until 6 weeks. According to our analysis, when cells are injected into the joint cavity they are first adsorbed onto the synovium, which consists of loose connective tissue, while the smooth meniscus and cartilage are difficult to adsorb. Therefore, the idea that intra-articularly injected MSCs exert a therapeutic effect by adsorbing to the damaged area and directly differentiating into new tissue needs further validation. In addition, it has been reported in the literature that synovial fluid has a complex composition containing a variety of inflammatory factors and chemokines (Ragni et al., 2022). MSCs can effectively reduce the level of pro-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages in synovial fluid (Chahal et al., 2019). Positive CD90 expression is the minimum criterion for MSC identification as defined by the International Society for Cellular Therapy, so we examined the level of CD90 expression in synovial fluid. The results showed the largest decrease of CD90 expression between 5 and 24 h, which is consistent with the results of in vivo fluorescence imaging (Supplementary Figure S4).",
        "Although MSCs have shown significant efficacy in preclinical animal models, due to factors such as individual differences among patients and a certain proportion of non-response phenomena, MSCs therapy still faces many challenges in the process of clinical transformation. In this study, a novel cell labeling method was adopted to explore the metabolism and distribution of iPSC-MSCs after intra-articular injection. The results showed that the fluorescence signal duration of Antares2-iMSCs in the OA group exceeded 2 weeks, which was longer than that in the sham operation group. Moreover, stem cell administration fully alleviated the phenomenon of articular cartilage loss in OA rats; Intra-articular injection of iPSC-MSCs is widely distributed in the synovium, cartilage, meniscus and synovial fluid, among which the proportion contained in the synovium is the largest. Exploring the metabolic and distribution characteristics of iPSC-MSCs is helpful for guiding the administration frequency and understanding its mechanism of action. Therefore, Antares2 is an excellent bioluminescence reporter gene. This study further demonstrated the safety and feasibility of intra-articular injection of iPSC-MSCs in the treatment of OA.",

Despite its prevalence, no medical treatment can reverse the joint cartilage degradation, leading many patients to undergo invasive procedures such as arthroplasty. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), particularly those derived from adipose tissue, have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach due to their ability to differentiate into chondrocytes and potentially regenerate cartilage. While MSCs from bone marrow and umbilical cord have shown efficacy in treating OA, adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSC) are more accessible and cost-effective. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic ADMSC in treating knee OA. METHODS: This triple-blind, interventional clinical trial included 20 patients with idiopathic knee OA, meeting the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an intra-articular injection of either 0.5 x 10(8) allogeneic ADMSC or saline (control group). Participants were evaluated for clinical signs of inflammation at baseline, and then at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months post-injection using clinical assessments, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), range of motion (ROM), and Magnetic Resonance Arthrography (MRA). RESULTS: The ADMSC group exhibited significant improvement in pain reduction as measured by VAS scores compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed between the groups in ROM, and based on KOOS; quality of life, activity of daily living (ADL), recreation and sports activities, symptom and pain. Although there were no significant changes in ADL, recreation, and sports activities between groups, the ADMSC group showed significant improvements between several follow-up periods. Similar improvements were reported in the ADMSC group between several follow-ups' periods on other scales. Radiological outcomes showed a significant increase in cartilage thickness at specific locations (e.g., middle-lateral patella (P = 0.017), Tibial compartment lateral (P < 0.000)) in the ADMSC group after 6 months, demonstrating the regenerative potential of ADMSC in certain MRA sites. Multivariable analysis underlines the complexity of the interactions among treatment, time, and baseline level of variables. Although ADMSC treatment shows potential for some measures, its effects are not consistently significant for all measures. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic ADMSC are safe and effective in reducing pain (based on VAS scale) and increasing cartilage thickness in knee OA patients. However, they do not significantly enhance quality of life or daily activity compared to placebo.

        "With the aging population and increased life expectancy [1], age-related diseases are expected to become a major public health concern [2]. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the degradation of cartilage, changes in subchondral bone and synovium, and consequent damage to the underlying bone tissue [3, 4]. It leads to morphological changes such as subchondral sclerosis, subchondral bone cysts, osteophyte formation, and synovitis [3, 5]. OA is a disease affecting the entire joint; each joint might have distinct alterations, such as meniscal degeneration, inflammation, and fibrosis of the infrapatellar fat pad in the knee joint.[6] OA predominantly affects older individuals [4]. This disease progresses slowly, resulting in the degradation of hyaline cartilage in the joint, pain, and reduced activity [7].",
        "OA can affect all joints in the body, with weight-bearing joints that are frequently subjected to mechanical stress being the most commonly involved [8, 9]. Neuropathic pain, depression, and sleep disorders are also associated with OA, contributing to the increased disease burden on society [10–12].",
        "Despite the prevalence of OA, there is no established medical treatment that can reverse the degradation of joint cartilage [13]. Cellular therapies have been under investigation for treating early to advanced stages of OA for approximately two decades [14]. Autologous chondrocyte transplantation has the potential to repair and regenerate cartilage, but it is a slow process with limited self-renewal and regeneration capacity [15–17]. Furthermore, it is an invasive procedure that requires surgical extraction of cartilage tissue from non-weight-bearing joints and transplantation to affected joints [15].",
        "The shortcomings of conventional medical treatments often lead to arthroplasty in patients with end-stage OA, where the damaged joint surfaces are replaced with prosthetics [18]. In recent years, researchers have focused on less invasive therapeutic methods to regenerate the full thickness of damaged joint cartilage, such as the use of stem cells [19]. Over the past decade, a new approach in OA treatment has emerged through tissue engineering and the application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [19]. MSCs are multipotent progenitor cells commonly found in various tissues, especially bone marrow and adipose tissue. They have the ability to differentiate into osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes, and can be easily harvested from tissues and used in patient treatments [20, 21].",
        "Our team did a previous study on the efficacy of placental mesenchymal stem cells in treating knee OA, [22] and there have been other studies on the subject [23, 24]. To date, numerous studies have been published examining the efficacy of autologous or allogeneic stem cells in the treatment of knee OA which indicate that mild to moderate OA can be effectively improved using autologous or allogeneic stem cells derived from adipose tissue or bone marrow [25–30].",
        "Given the accessibility of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC) through less invasive methods compared to bone marrow-derived stem cells, along with their lower cost and insufficient evidence regarding the clinical application of ADMSC in treating OA [31], we decided to conduct a study to determine the efficacy and safety of allogeneic ADMSC in treating knee OA among patients visiting the physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic in the year 2015.",
        "The study was conducted as an interventional triple-blind clinical trial according to the CONSORT guidelines [32] after the institutional board review by Iran University of medical sciences (ethic code number: IR.IUMS.REC.1394.26914, 24 January 2016 and Trial Registry Code: IRCT2016021123298N3, 20 February 2016). Twenty patients with idiopathic knee OA were selected and enrolled in the study with informed consent. The ethics of this study are in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards [33].",
        "Initially, we administered 108 abdominal ADMSC to two patients. Both experienced mild adverse effects, including transient inflammation in both cases and a single instance of skin rash. As a result, the cell count of injection was reduced to 0.5 × 108 cells, with no observed adverse effects at this lower dose, as was observed in pervious study [34]. We subsequently adopted this cell count for all further treatments. Both patients who received the higher cell count were excluded from the study. A total of 0.5 × 108 abdominal ADMSC were injected intra-articularly under sterile conditions into 10 patients in the intervention group, who were randomly assigned.",
        "Patients were evaluated for clinical signs of inflammatory reactions 30 min after the injection, and then at intervals of two weeks, two months, and six months post-injection. They underwent clinical assessments (inflammatory reaction symptoms, VAS, KOOS, ROM, etc.) and paraclinical evaluations –magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA)- at baseline and six months after the injection (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Consort diagram. Subjects were randomized to a 1:1 ratio. No patients withdrew from the study after randomization till the end of follow up duration. Cr; Creatinine, KL; kellgren-lawrence, BMI; Body Mass Index",

        "Twenty patients with knee OA were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups: control (n = 10) and ADMSC (n = 10). We enrolled the patients into this study based on the following criteria: 1. Patients with diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis based on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, [35] graded as 2, 3, or 4 according to the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria. [36] 2. Patients with the ability to follow up with the study.",
        "Also, patients with following conditions were excluded from the study. 1. Age below 18 or above 75 years. 2. Presence of any acute or chronic infection. 3.Significant knee deformity (varus > 10° or valgus > 20°). 4. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. 5. Presence of any neoplasia. 6. BMI > 35. 7. Conditions associated with immune system weakness. 8. Presence of inflammatory joint diseases or secondary osteoarthritis. 9. Intra-articular injections within the past three months. 10. History of knee surgery. 11. Renal dysfunction (Creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL). 12. Liver dysfunction (Bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL, AST/ALT > 100 IU/L). 13. Uncontrolled diabetes.",
        "Donor eligibility and suitability was assessed referring to the national guidelines for cell manufacturing [37].",
        "For the isolation of MSCs from adipose tissue, necessary arrangements were made with the surgical departments of medical centers, and informed consent was obtained from donors. All procedures were carried out in a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility (A class clean room) following current GMP guidelines [38]. The adipose tissue was collected and washed three times with physiological serum (0.9% sodium chloride solution) to remove any remaining blood. The washed tissue was then exposed to 15 mL of an enzymatic solution (0.1% Collagenase IV (gibco—ThermoFisher) in DMEM f12 medium (gibco—ThermoFisher)). The tissue was incubated at 37°C for 0.5 to 1 h and shaken every 10 min. After enzymatic digestion by collagenase, 15 mL of physiological serum was added, and the mixture was centrifuged in 1200 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the sedimented cells were cultured in a specific medium (DMEM f12 (gibco—ThermoFisher) + 10% human serum (gibco—ThermoFisher) + 50 u/mL penicillin + 50μg/mL streptomycin (gibco – ThermoFisher) + 1 mM L-glutamine (gibco – ThermoFisher)). Subsequently, the cells were characterized by assessing surface markers and differentiation potential. These cells must have the potential to differentiate into three lineages: adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes, and be positive for markers CD73, CD90, CD105, and negative for markers CD34, CD31, CD45. It is important to note that since the cells in this study were used allogeneically, necessary tests to prevent contamination transfer to the host and cytology were conducted in accordance with the national guidelines for the use of stem cells (approved by the Ministry of Health). The cells were injected into the patient’s knee by a specialist physician at passage 4 in 2 cc of normal saline. In the control group, normal saline was injected.",
        "This study was designed as a triple-blind clinical trial to eliminate bias in the treatment and outcome assessments. Twenty patients with knee OA were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups: the control group (n = 10) and the ADMSC group (n = 10).",
        "A random number sequence generated by a computer was used for randomization. Allocation concealment was accomplished by placing group assignments in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes that were only opened at the time of the intervention.",
        "Blinding was maintained at three levels. 1. Patients were not informed about their group or type of injection. 2. Healthcare practitioners giving interventions were blinded to group allocations using identical syringes for both groups. A third party not participating in the study labeled the syringes with simply the participant’s number. 3. Outcome assessors were unaware of group allocations to ensure unbiased evaluation of results.",
        "In the control group, patients got an intra-articular injection of normal saline, whereas the case group received 0.5 × 108 ADMSC. Both interventions were designed to appear equal in volume and color, ensuring that the blinding remained consistent throughout the research.",
        "Questionnaire 1 contains the demographic questionnaire for patients before ADMSC injection, which includes age, gender, weight, height, BMI, education level, medical history, medication history, and history of major knee trauma. Questionnaire 2 (KOOS) presents the KOOS (Knee injury and OA Outcome Score) questionnaire, consisting of 42 questions covering five domains: symptoms, pain, Activities of daily living (ADL), recreational/sport activities, and quality of life (QOL) [39].",
        "Questionnaire 3 comprises the follow-up form for knee OA patients after ADMSC injection, which includes Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) results, scores from the five domains of the KOOS questionnaire, knee functional metrics (Range of Motion (ROM) and flexion contracture) via examination, radiological parameters of the knee, and the level of patient compliance. Questionnaire 4 is a form providing information on MSC injection and reminders for patient follow-up at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months post-injection, which is given to the patient before the injection. The results of the knee functional metrics (ROM and flexion contracture) are assessed through examination, while the VAS is used to measure the patient’s pain intensity. Radiological parameters of the knee are reported based on MRA films taken before and 6 months after the ADMSC injection which are listed in Table 1.Table 1There was a total of 28 places where the thickness of the cartilage was measured, with a minimum and maximum value recorded at each of the 14 separate sites.

        "We conducted Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) utilizing a Siemens Avanto Fit 1.5T equipment. A 20 mL solution of gadolinium (0.6% concentration, DOTAREM) was administered under sterile circumstances using a lateral parapatellar route. The images were examined in coronal, sagittal, and axial perspectives using MarcoPacs software. Subsequently, an experienced radiologist, who was unaware of the treatment groups, assessed the images. The thickness of the cartilage was measured in millimeters at 14 specific locations (as shown in Table 1). The minimum and maximum thickness were recorded, resulting in a total of 28 measurements per patient.",
        "The primary outcome of this study was the change in KOOS score from baseline to six months. The sample size was determined based on data from a previous study [40]. Using a significance level (α) of 0.05, an effect size (Cohen’s d) of 1.96, a statistical power of 80% (1 − β), a mean KOOS score difference of 33.3, and an estimated standard deviation of 17.0, the initial calculation yielded a required sample size of 5 participants per group. However, a moderate effect size (Cohen’s d ≈ 0.5) was applied to ensure a more conservative and robust estimation, resulting in an adjusted sample size of 12 participants per group. To further enhance our study’s reliability and statistical power, we increased the final sample size to 20 patients per group.",
        "The collected data were entered into a computer after being cleaned and were analyzed using SPSS software version 24 [41]. Fisher’s exact and chi-square tests were used for categorical variables, and t-test and one-way ANOVA were used for continuous variables. P < 0.05 was regarded as statistical significance. The sample size for this pilot trial was determined using the precedent set by previous safety and pharmacokinetic investigations [42–44]. Then, no explicit a priori power calculation was performed for secondary exploratory endpoints.",
        "Additionally, a repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to examine how stem cell treatment influences multiple outcome measures over three-time points: 2 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months. The study included time as a within-subjects factor and group assignment (ADMSC vs. Control) as a between-subjects factor. To account for potential confounding effects, the analysis controlled for several covariates, including age, sex, baseline scores (such as ADL Baseline, Sport and Recreational Baseline, QOL Baseline, and VAS Baseline), BMI, and KLS. Multiple multivariate significance tests were applied to assess the interaction effects of time and other covariates, including Pillai’s trace, Wilks’ lambda, Hotelling’s trace, and Roy’s largest root. Additionally, Mauchly’s test of sphericity was used to check whether the assumption of sphericity was met. If violations were detected, Greenhouse–Geisser corrections were applied. As a follow-up, univariate tests were performed to analyze within-subject and between-subject effects, helping to identify which specific variables contributed to significant interactions. A significance threshold of p < 0.05 was set for all statistical analyses.",
        "A total of 20 patients were enrolled in the study and completed it in its entirety. Due to the small sample size, Fisher’s Exact Test was used to compare gender distribution between the two groups, which showed no significant difference between them (p-value = 0.585). Additionally, the participants in the two groups were also similar in terms of age and body mass index (BMI) (p-value > 0.05– p-values respectively 0.52, and 0.71).

The interaction effect of groups and time on ADL was not significant (P-Value = 0.758) meaning that the daily activity of the two groups did not differ significantly. Also the symptom, given the significant difference between the two groups at the baseline of this variable, the baseline value was included as a covariate in further analyses. The interaction effect of group and time on symptoms was not significant (P-Value = 0.267), indicating that the behavior of the two groups was statistically similar.

        "The multivariate test (p = 0.049) showed a notable Time × Group interaction for pain outcomes (VAS); this effect was not significant after sphericity was corrected (p = 0.112). This implies weak evidence of variations in the trajectory of pain reduction between ADMSC and placebo groups. A notable quadratic effect of time (p = 0.023) suggested a non-linear trend in pain scores; BMI was then found to interact with this trend (p = 0.024) strongly, implying BMI modulates pain changes across time. However, no significant overall treatment effect of ADMSC on pain was observed (p = 0.364).",

However, no significant interactions between time and other factors such as age, BMI, or baseline QOL were observed.",
        "There was no notable overall shift across time regarding sport and recreational activity. However, the study found a strong quadratic interaction between time and group (p = 0.014), implying a more complex pattern of change in the stem cell and placebo groups than a straightforward rise or reduction. This indicates that the two groups followed different trajectories over time. Furthermore, a major predictor of outcomes (p = 0.032) was baseline sport and recreational activity levels; therefore, people with higher or lower baseline activity levels followed different change patterns.",
        "The analysis indicates that baseline ADL performance and time were key change factors, with some evidence of differential trajectories between treatment groups. However, the influence of ADMSC therapy on ADL improvements remains inconclusive based on our findings.",
        "These findings underline the complexity of the interactions among treatment, time, and baseline level of variables, highlighting the use of baseline predictors such as BMI, ROM, and baseline activity levels in shaping outcomes. Although stem cell treatment shows potential for some measures, its effects are not consistently significant across all measures.",
        "The results of the present study indicated that based on the VAS, the therapeutic intervention had a significant impact on reducing pain in patients compared to the control group. The VAS scores for patients in the ADMSC group decreased after six months. In the assessment of ROM, the changes observed over the specified time intervals between the two groups did not differ significantly. This suggests that stem cells did not have a greater effect than placebo in improving patients’ ROM. Moreover, the results from QOL, ADL, Symptom scores, and the mean scores for sports and recreational activities indicated no significant difference between the two groups.",
        "Although there were no significant changes in KOOS criterions (ADL, symptom, pain, QOL and sprots and recreational activities) between groups, within ADMSC group significant improvements were observed between several follow-up periods. Almost all studies that used MSCs to treat knee OA demonstrated varying clinical benefits in MSC-applied group [22, 29, 45, 46]. Notably, within the control group, we observed clinical improvement in several KOOS subscales during follow-up periods. Some studies found that injecting normal saline had a considerable placebo effect in improving patient-reported outcomes for knee OA [47, 48]. There is no clear scientific explanation for this finding.",
        "A similar study by Soltani et.al was conducted on 20 patients with knee OA, where 10 patients received stem cells from the placenta and were compared to 10 patients in the placebo group. In this study, only the improvement in ROM and one criterion of the KOOS questionnaire, Symptoms, showed a significant difference between the placenta-derived stem cells and placebo groups. Other variables, such as VAS and radiological changes, did not show significant differences compared to the placebo group [22].",
        "A study assessed the safety and efficacy of allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells in 22 patients with bilateral knee OA. Patients received either low (1 × 107), medium (2 × 107), or high (5 × 107) dosages by two intra-articular injections. Outcomes included pain and functional improvements and a slight increase in cartilage volume in the low-dose group based on MRI. The findings indicated the safety and potential benefits of these cells for OA [42]. In a study conducted by Murphy et.al., the role of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs injected into the knee joints for the repair and regeneration of damaged joint tissue following OA induction showed that intra-articular injection of 10 × 106 cells, the cell treatment resulted in a decrease in the degeneration of the articular cartilage, osteophytic remodeling, and subchondral sclerosis in the joints [49]. Another study evaluated the effect of autologous ADMSC on dogs with chronic OA, showing beneficial effects on disease improvement [50]. For another experiment, a total of 55 patients who received various doses of allogeneic bone marrow MSCs. Following a 2-year observation period, no negative effects were seen, and the group of individuals who received the cells experienced an increase in meniscal volume and a notable decrease in pain as assessed by the VAS [51]. A clinical trial involving four patients with moderate to severe OA was conducted where MSCs were administered intra-articularly. The results indicated that this method is safe and without complications; however, the effect of these stem cells on disease and pain severity was not notable [52]. Other studies also showed the similar results [53–57].",
        "We employed MRA assessment to enhance the accuracy and precision of measuring chondral thickness [58, 59]. It was noted that the therapeutic intervention did not significantly affect changes in MMP, ILP, MFF, LCW, MCN, MCW, TCM, and IMP in patients over the course of treatment. Out of the 28 locations used to test cartilage thickness in each patient, there was a significant increase in cartilage thickness in the following areas between the initial treatment and the 6 months follow-up in the ADMSC group: MLP (Max), TCL (Max), MCN (Max), LCW (Max), MFF (Max), LCN (Max), LFF (Max), LFF(min), MMP(max), and SLP (Max). Although, Soltani and colleagues’ investigation did not find any significant alterations in MRA characteristics; chondral thickness experienced a notable increase in around 10% of the assessed regions of cartilage in the knee joints of patients who were administered MSCs [22]. Also the Lu et.al study showed increase in cartilage thickness [42]. Other studies also showed similar results [60, 61].",
        "MSCs are versatile cells found in various tissues such as bone marrow, periosteum, trabecular bone, fat pad tissue, synovial membrane, and others. They can significantly stimulate the growth of chondrocytes and transform them into cartilage, making them extremely valuable for tissue regeneration [62, 63]. The main sources of therapeutic MSCs are bone marrow and adipose tissue. It is worth noting that MSCs derived from different tissues can differentiate into cartilage [63]. Also it is noteworthy that, the downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins and T-cell co-stimulatory molecules in MSCs enables the safe and effective use of these cells both systemically and locally, without the risk of severe immune reactions [64].",
        "The primary influence of MSCs on the restoration of OA joints is the stimulation of the local microenvironment through paracrine signaling. MSCs have demonstrated the ability to promote tissue regeneration through paracrine signals originating from MSCs [65]. Nevertheless, the precise mechanics of these processes are currently under investigation. Also Efficiently determining the optimal dosage of MSCs for effective treatment of knee OA is currently a subject of ongoing research. debates persist regarding the optimum number of stem cells required to enhance the symptoms of OA [66].",
        "This study is one of few clinical trial that specifically investigates the utilization of allogeneic ADMSC cells from fat tissue for the treatment of knee OA. An extensive evaluation methodology was utilized, incorporating clinical assessments, patient-reported outcomes (such as the KOOS questionnaire and VAS scores), and MRA to determine the effectiveness and safety of the treatment. Also the selection of participants was based on particular criteria, such as age, BMI, and the severity of OA. This ensured that the sample of individuals with knee OA was diverse and representative.",
        "The investigation was conducted with a limited sample size of only 20 patients, which restricts the statistical power and the capacity to extrapolate findings to the wider community. A six-month follow-up period may not provide enough time to assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of ADMSC therapy in knee OA. The precise dosage of ADMSC for the treatment of knee OA remains unknown. Also, the study employed a precise cell dosage, nevertheless, ongoing discussions continue to exist over the optimal therapeutic dosage that would maximize advantages while minimizing potential hazards. Further investigation is warranted to examine the correlation between dosage and response in order to ascertain the optimal treatment protocols. Additionally, the effects of stem cell therapy on other knee joint tissues, such as the infrapatellar fat pad and synovial membrane, were not evaluated. Future research should explore these aspects to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the therapeutic potential of stem cells in knee OA.",
        "Allogeneic ADMSC are safe for treating patients with knee OA, providing improvements in pain (based on VAS score) and radiological aspects related to the disease. However, they do not offer additional benefits over placebo in improving quality of life, daily activities, and sports activities. Further studies are needed to include this treatment in the therapeutic algorithm for patients with knee OA.",

We observed the proliferation and stemness of AD-MSCs selected from the 5 patients showing the most improvement and from the 5 patients with the least improvement, and completed further in vitro experiments including beta-galactosidase activity, reactive oxygen species and bioinformatic analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that patients treated with HTO + AD-MSCs had a significant reduction in knee OA severity as compared to patients treated with HTO alone. Moreover, we discovered that proliferation and colony forming efficiency of AD-MSCs selected from the 5 patients showing the most improvement performed significantly better than cells selected from the 5 patients with the least improvement.

        "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic joint disease characterized by a progressive degeneration of the articular cartilage, which leads to pain, functional impairment, and eventually substantial disability [1, 2]. Non-surgical options for OA remain focused on symptom relief with medications [3, 4], while surgical interventions include procedures such as high tibial osteotomy (HTO) for early-stage OA and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for advanced cases [5, 6]. Currently, there are very few long-term solutions that repair and regenerate the articular cartilage tissue and address the underlying pathology of OA [7]. As a result, there is an urgent need for new approaches that are able to halt and/or reverse the progression of the disease [8].",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have garnered a lot attention as a “drug store” for treating knee OA due to their ability to secrete trophic factors that have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, and as a “cell reservoir” due to their ability to self-renew and differentiate into cells that can repair damaged joint tissue, especially articular cartilage [8, 9]. One additional consideration that makes articular cartilage an attractive site for MSC therapy is safety since the cells are injected locally into the joint as opposed to systemically into the circulation. Over the years, a variety of MSCs from different tissue sources have been used, some with promising results [10]. However, the overall efficacy of MSC-based therapy for OA has been inconsistent [11, 12]. Some studies have reported significant improvements in OA symptoms with MSC-based therapy, while others found no discernible improvement [13–15]. This may be due to differences in individual patients, the source and preparation of the MSCs, as well as allogenic versus autologous donors [16]. In the present study, we hypothesized that the inconsistent clinical outcomes found with autologous MSC-based therapies in OA are related to differences in the quality and quantity of the injected MSCs.",
        "Recently, the concept of MSC “immune privilege” has been challenged due to mounting evidence suggesting that allogenic MSCs elicit an immune response the leads to rejection [17, 18]. Although MSCs produce trophic factors, including transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1), indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which strongly modulate the immune system when MSCs mount a response to an inflammatory environment or are stimulated with interferon-γ (IFN-γ), the stimulated MSCs or their differentiated progeny express high levels of MHC class I and II antigens [19], which delay the rejection of allogeneic MSCs. Moreover, it has been reported that allogeneic MSCs are rejected more quickly in animals that have been previously sensitized, with the majority of the cells killed within 48 h after systemic infusion [20, 21]. Likely, the clinical outcomes of allogeneic MSC therapies are due to the trophic factors produced shortly after infusion, resulting in a so called “hit-and-run” effect [17], while fewer reports have suggested that the newly formed tissue in vivo is generated directly by the transplanted allogeneic MSCs [12, 22]. Biosafety should also be a concern since pathogens, including those known and potentially unknown, can be transmitted from the transplanted allogeneic MSCs to the recipient. Thus, for these reasons, autologous stem cell-based therapies are preferable. In the present study, autologous AD-MSCs were used to treat patients with knee OA because adipose tissue can be isolated from an abundant tissue source via minimally invasive procedures, are functionally comparable to bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs and pose no immunogenicity risks [23]. Furthermore, AD-MSCs have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a variety of diseases, including the repair of critical organs such as the heart, liver, and kidneys, helping to regulate the immune response and tissue repair [24–29]. These multifaceted therapeutic effects underscore the versatility of AD-MSCs and their potential as a valuable cell-based therapy for a wide range of degenerative and inflammatory conditions.",
        "To test our hypothesis, we conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial with 45 knee OA patients who were divided into a control group consisting of 22 patients treated with HTO alone and an experimental group with 23 patients treated with HTO followed by intra-articular injection of autologous AD-MSCs (HTO + AD-MSCs). The effect of treatment was assessed by measuring pain intensity and pain relief, improvement in joint function, and cartilage regeneration in the two groups. Specifically, MRI and X-ray were performed pre-operation and 12 months post-operation. WOMAC and VAS score were collected four times, every 6 months over a 24-month period. More importantly, the characteristics of the injected autologous AD-MSCs were analyzed in the laboratory. The results we obtained supported our hypothesis and, for the first time, suggest that the stemness and senescence of the injected autologous AD-MSCs were closely correlated with clinical outcomes/success.",

Initially, 60 knee OA patients were recruited and enrolled; each was provided a subject number that was randomly generated using the PASS (NCSS LLC., USA) software package. After screening to determine if the subjects met the inclusion criteria (Supplemental Table 1), assignment to either the control (n = 22) or experimental (n = 23) groups was performed using a randomization table listing all subject numbers. Inclusion criteria was showed as follows: aged 18–65 years, male and female, patient can tolerate surgery; clinical diagnosis of degenerative arthritis by radiographic criteria; obviously extra-articular malformation; good contralateral interventricular cartilage; course of disease ≥ 6 months; there was no obvious abnormality in tumor marker detection, or patient was evaluated has not at the risk of cancer; subjects who understand and sign the consent form for this study.

        "The control group of patients received a medial open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO), while patients in the experimental group received both a HTO and liposuction (used to prepare autologous AD-MSCs) on the day of surgery and then 1 month later received an intra-articular knee injection of 5 × 107 autologous AD-MSCs (HTO + AD-MSCs). The injected cells were straight from adipose tissue and never frozen. A timeline showing the milestones for the entire 2-year study are shown in Fig. 1B; the milestones include regular examinations to obtain baseline characteristics, HTO surgery, preparation and intra-articular injection of autologous AD-MSCs or vehicle (sodium hyaluronate), and rehabilitation and efficacy evaluation.",
        "As shown in Fig. 1B, OA patients received preoperative X-rays, an MRI, and laboratory evaluations. All surgical procedures were performed by the same experienced team. For each case, an exploratory arthroscopy was performed immediately before the osteotomy to confirm the indications for a medial open wedge HTO and to evaluate articular cartilage damage. All procedures for performing the medial open wedge HTO were as previously described in detail [30, 31]. In brief, lower limb alignment was carefully adjusted to mild valgus and then fixed using the TomoFix internal fixation system (DePuy Synthes, Switzerland). After the osteotomy was completely healed at 1 year postoperatively, the internal fixation hardware was removed and a second-look arthroscopy performed. All patients received the same physical rehabilitation program and clinical follow-up for at least 2 years (Fig. 1B).",
        "To isolate AD-MSCs, 50 ml of autologous adipose tissues of patients were obtained by liposuction from abdominal subcutaneous fat under mature procedures, including sterilization, local anesthesia, incision, injection of tumescent solution, adipose tissue collection, and suture. The adipose tissue was repeatedly rinsed with physiological saline until free of red blood cells, and then incubated with 0.1% type I collagenase (catalog number SCR103, Sigma Aldrich, USA) digestion solution. The sample was sealed and oscillated at 90 revolutions/min for 30–60 min at 37 °C until no large fat particles remained. Cells were collected after removing the fascia with a 100 μm filter and seeded in T75 flask with 3 × 106 cells/ml, then cultured in a 37 °C and 5% CO2/95% air incubator in MSC Base Medium (catalog number 6114011, Dakewe, China) supplemented with 5% serum substitute (UltroGRO, Helios, USA); media were refreshed 2 times per week. When the cells reached 80% confluency, the cultures were digested using TrypLE solution and serially passaged.",
        "At passage 5 (P5), a series of tests were performed before delivery to the clinic for injection. Before injection, AD-MSC phenotype was assessed using flow cytometry. A cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml) was prepared and mixed with mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies to CD34 (catalog number 560942, BD, USA), CD44 (catalog number 555479, BD, USA), CD45 (catalog number 555483, BD, USA), CD73 (catalog number 561254, BD, USA), CD90 (catalog number 555596, BD, USA), CD105 (catalog number 560839, BD, USA), and HLA-DR (catalog number 560896, BD, USA). The mixture was incubated in a dark place for 20 min, washed, and the cells resuspended in 200 μl PBS. Phenotyping was then performed using the Guava easyCyte (MERCK Millipore, USA) flow cytometer. A microbiological safety examination was performed to identify the presence of endotoxin, mycoplasmas (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Ureaplasma urealyticum) and viruses (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, syphilis, and cytomegalovirus). Samples of AD-MSCs from each patient in passage 0 were stored in liquid nitrogen for future assay.",
        "After passing the above tests, AD-MSCs were prepared as needed for intra-articular injection. The injection volume and number of cells were determined refer to published studies [32, 33]. For each patient, 5 × 107 cells were resuspended in injectable sterile isotonic (0.9%) normal saline to a total of 3 ml before injection. All injections were performed by a single surgeon at 1 month after HTO.",
        "All data collection, measurements, and analyses were conducted by the same group of investigators who were blinded to the identity of each subject’s experimental group. Clinical assessments included arthroscopic, radiological, and functional evaluations. Knee arthroscopy is the most reliable and precise method for assessing/observing articular cartilage status. The International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grading system is a standardized method for assessing cartilage repair. It evaluates the quality and characteristics of cartilage tissue in both preclinical studies and clinical settings. Arthroscopic evaluation was carried out using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) classification system [34, 35]. Radiological evaluation was based on preoperative and 1-year postoperative knee MRI and X-ray images. MRI results were graded using a Modified MRI Grading System of the ICRS [36]. X-ray images were evaluated using the Kellgren–Lawrence (K–L) classification [37], Hip–Knee–Ankle (HKA) angle, and tibial plateau slope. At baseline, and at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively, all patients’ Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores [38] were evaluated to clinically assess changes in knee function. In terms of safety, postoperative complications were recorded, including complications such as nonunion of the osteotomy, infection, loosening of the internal fixation device, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and bone tumors.",
        "Based on the degree of cartilage repair observed arthroscopically for 24 months follow-up, we ranked and selected the top 5 (Sub-group a) and bottom 5 (Sub-group b) cases, based on ICRS scores, for further analysis stemness of the injected AD-MSCs. Sub-group a and sub-group b were chosen according to a multiple ranking system. The improvement in arthroscopic evaluation was considered to be the most important indicator, then MRI grading improvement, and WOMAC score. An aliquot of each patient’s AD-MSCs that had been stored in liquid nitrogen immediately after isolation were thawed and then cultured in complete media containing MSCBM (catalog number 6114011, Dakewe, China), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (catalog number P1400, Solarbio, China) and 5% serum substitute (UltroGRO, Helios, U.S.). Fifty percent media changes were performed every 3 days. For expansion, P1-P3 cells were seeded at 6 × 103 cells/cm2 into 100 mm culture dishes and cultured for 7 days. For cell passage, incubation in 0.25% Trypsin–EDTA (catalog number 25200072, Gibco, USA) for 2 min was used and the number of cells counted using an automated cell counter (TC20, Bio-Rad, USA). Cell counting data were used to evaluate AD-MSC proliferation. The AD-MSC samples were used for further in vitro experiments (Supplemental Figure 1).",
        "For assay of CFU-fibroblasts (CFU-F), CFU-osteoblasts (CFU-OB) and CFU-adipocytes (CFU-AD), P1 and P3 cells were plated into six-well plates at 200 and 600 cells/well.",
        "After 12 days of culture, CFU-AD samples were induced following the instructions accompanying an adipogenic differentiation kit (catalog number HUXMD-90031, Oricell, China) and culture for 7 days; similarly, CFU-OB samples were induced by following the instructions accompanying an osteogenic differentiation kit (catalog number HUXMD-90021, Oricell, China) and culture for 14 days. On day 14 of culture, samples for assay of CFU-F were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed with 1×PBS, and stained with crystal violet (catalog number C0121, Beyotime, China) for 10 min to visualize the cell colonies. Analogously, after 14 days of incubation in osteoblast differentiation media, samples for assay of CFU-OB were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed with 1×PBS, stained with Alizarin Red (catalog number ALIR-10001, Oricell, China) for 10 min, and then 1×PBS added to preserve cell morphology.

        "To assess the level of ROS, P1 and P3 cells were seeded at 1.2 × 104 cells per well into 24-well plates, cultured for 7 days, and then assayed using a ROS assay kit (catalog number 50101ES01, Yeason, China), following the instructions accompanying the kit. The amount of ROS present was observed and documented using an inverted phase contrast fluorescence microscope.",
        "Alterations of AD-MSCs function correlated with cellular structure, and TEM is a powerful technique that allows for the detailed visualization of cellular structures. We intended to compare sub-group a with sub-group b through TEM assay, which provided critical insights into the mechanisms. Cells were collected and fixed in TEM fixative (catalog number G1102 Servicebio, China), and in turn were subjected to agarose pre-embedding, post-fixation, dehydration, resin infiltration, polymerization, ultramicrotomy to prepare thin sections (Leica UC7 Leica, Germany), and staining. Finally, the cells were observed under TEM (HT7800, HITACHI, Japan) to prepare transmission electron micrographs.",

All RNA samples of human AD-MSCs from sub-group a and sub-group b were collected and library preparations for transcriptome sequencing were completed and sequenced. Raw data were processed to obtain clean data and all downstream analyses were based on clean data with high quality. Reference genome and gene model annotation files were downloaded from genome website directly. Index of the reference genome was built and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using HISAT2.

        "Based on the encouraging imaging studies, we proceeded to quantitate cartilage repair using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grading system (Fig. 2B, C). At baseline, there was no statistical difference in ICRS grades (using the MRI and arthroscopy images) between the two groups of subjects. After HTO alone, the 1-year postoperative ICRS grading of the MRI results showed that the number of patients in each grade was distributed as follows: Grade I: 4 (18%), Grade II: 4 (18%), Grade III: 5 (23%), and Grade IV: 9 (41%). In contrast, after HTO followed by injection of AD-MSCs, the number of patients in each grade was distributed as follows: Grade I: 10 (43%), Grade II: 6 (26%), Grade III: 3 (13%), and Grade IV: 4 (17%), suggesting that the combination of both surgery and stem cells significantly reduced the severity of OA as compared to patients treated with HTO alone. Next, we validated the results using arthroscopic images which allowed direct observation of the knee articular cartilage. Consistent with the MRI results, the arthroscopy showed that the number of patients in each grade after HTO alone was as follows: Grade I: 4 (18%), Grade II: 7 (31%), Grade III: 6 (27%), and Grade IV: 5 (23%). In contrast, after HTO followed by injection of AD-MSCs, the number of patients in each grade were distributed as follows: Grade I: 10 (43%), Grade II: 9 (39%), Grade III: 3 (13%) and Grade IV: 1 (4.3%). These data are graphically displayed in Fig. 2B, C and show that the proportion of patients with severe knee OA was significantly reduced after the combined treatment (HTO + AD-MSCs) versus HTO alone.",
        "To evaluate improvement in functionality and pain relief, WOMAC and VAS assessments were performed at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment (Fig. 2D, E). The results showed that there was no improvement in the VAS assessment; however, by 24 months there was a statistically significant reduction in WOMAC scores for the HTO + AD-MSC versus HTO group.",
        "Since there was such a wide variation in arthroscopic findings, no statistically significant differences could be discerned when all of the ICRS scores (i.e. grades) were averaged and then compared (HTO versus HTO + AD-MSC groups). To test whether the observed differences were correlated with variability in stemness of autologous of AD-MSCs, we chose the top 5 patients with an ICRS Grade of I as a sub-group “a” and the bottom 5 patients with an ICRS grade of III–IV as a sub-group “b” from the HTO + AD-MSCs group for comprehensive analysis of their AD-MSCs.",
        "The individual improvement of ICRS grades for patients in sub-groups a and b were statistically different (Fig. 3A); in contrast, patients in sub-group b were not different from those in the HTO group, while patients in sub-group a were significantly different. Overall, patients in sub-groups a and b were not statistically different regarding age or BMI (Fig. 3B, C). To exclude the influence of surgical factors, we compared the major indicator, postoperative HKA angle, between the two subgroups. Results showed that the lower limb alignment after HTO were basically consistent (Fig. 3D). As a part of our quality control process, we routinely analyze MSCs for the expression of specific sets of surface markers before administration to the patients, as prescribed by the International Society for Cellular Therapy position statement (ISCT) [39]. In our analysis of sub-group a and b, we found that > 95% of the cells consistently expressed CD90, CD105, CD73 as well as CD44 with no significant differences between the two groups (Fig. 3E–H). In addition, < 1% of AD-MSCs from both sub-groups expressed CD34, CD45 and HLA-DR (Fig. 3I–K).

        "To determine whether the wide variation in clinical outcomes was related to the stemness of the injected AD-MSCs, we studied the proliferation of each subject’s AD-MSCs by subculturing their cells for 3 passages (7 days/passage). The cell counts for both sub-groups dropped with increasing number of passages (Fig. 4A), but cells in sub-group a proliferated to a significantly greater extent than those in sub-group b at all three passages. Cell doubling time in sub-group a was significantly shorter and relatively stable as compared to that of sub-group b (Fig. 4B).

MSCs from sub-group a formed a greater number of CFU-F, (twofold greater at passage 1 [P1]), which were larger and more densely stained, than those from sub-group b (Fig. 4C, D). We also compared the ability of AD-MSCs from sub-groups a versus b to differentiate into osteoblasts (CFU-OB) or adipocytes (CFU-AD) in response to each lineage’s differentiation media. The degree of Alizarin Red staining for mineral in each CFU-OB, as well as the number of CFU-OB at P1 and P3, was higher from cells in sub-group a than sub-group b (Fig. 4C, D). Moreover, we found more Oil red O-stained adipocytes in each CFU-AD with higher numbers of CFU-AD formed by AD-MSCs (P1 and P3) from sub-group a than sub-group b (Fig. 4C, D).

        "10 samples were collected, including 5 in sub-group “a” and 5 in sub-group “b”, and RNA-sequencing were performed, which may provide a deeper view in AD-MSCs regulation. First, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to deeply explore the relationships between these samples and the magnitude of variation. The results indicated that AD-MSCs from sub-group a and b were different, though all were AD-MSCs from adipose tissue (Fig. 6A). Then, differential gene expression analysis was conducted. We have detected that there are indeed some differences between sub-group “a” and sub-group “b”, however, molecule and signaling pathway changes are the most important. In total, 304 genes with significantly different expression were identified, consisting of 66 genes upregulated and 238 genes downregulated, in which sub-group a was as control (Fig. 6B, C). There are individual differences in each group, considering the individual differences are inevitable. After further analysis of different expression genes by KEGG enrichment analysis and GO enrichment analysis (Fig. 6D–G), we found that genes related with cellular processes especially cell growth and death were enriched such as CCNB1, CCNB2, CDK1 and CDC20. Specifically, differentially expressed genes were enriched in cell cycle, mitotic process and cellular senescence. Further, as most enrichment analysis demonstrated the pivotal role of cell cycle pathway, we performed GSEA to explore the expression details and alterations in sub-group a and b. Genes related with cell cycle pathway were mostly located in sub-group a, revealing the essential role of cell cycle in AD-MSCs (Fig. 6H). Taken together, cell cycle pathway might correlate with the regeneration and repair capacity of ADMSCs and more exploration was needed in the future. These results revealed that genes connected with cell cycle were the possibly regulatory targets to prevent cell senescence and therapeutic effect of AD-MSCs.Fig. 6RNA-sequencing of AD-MSCs from sub-groups a and b.

        "During the last two decades, approximately 25 studies, which include ~ 500 knee OA patients treated with MSCs, have been fully described; notably, about 80% (20 out of 25) of these studies were conducted with patients who received autologous MSCs [12]. In the 20 studies investigating autologous stem cell therapy, 6 studies utilized autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), 13 studies used autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs), and 1 studies employed autologous activated peripheral blood stem cells (AAPBSCs). Among the 6 studies using autologous BM-MSCs, 4 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 were non-randomized comparative studies [14, 41–45]. Notably, only one (16.7%) of these studies reported satisfactory therapeutic outcomes. Of the 13 studies utilizing autologous AD-MSCs, 4 were RCTs and 9 were non-randomized comparative studies [15, 33, 46–53]. Among these, 6 (46.2%) studies demonstrated satisfactory therapeutic effects. The single study investigating autologous activated peripheral blood stem cells reported only fair outcomes [54]. It is important to note that some of these studies administered stem cell injections alone, while others combined them with additional biological agents. Moreover, the control group interventions varied across these studies, contributing to the heterogeneity of the results.",
        "These variations in study design, MSC source, treatment protocols, and control interventions may partly explain the inconsistency in reported outcomes across studies. This underscores the need for more standardized protocols to accurately assess the efficacy of MSC-based therapies for OA. Overall, the clinical outcomes of these studies show a large variation in improvement between MSC and control groups. Here, we provide strong evidence demonstrating that there is substantial biological variability in the function of autologous AD-MSCs and this variability likely contributes to the inconsistent clinical outcomes reported.",
        "HTO is a surgical procedure used to realign the load-bearing axis of the knee and relieve pain, retard articular cartilage degeneration, and postpone the need for a total knee arthroplasty [55, 56]. However, HTO alone has limited capacity to repair cartilage damage, resulting in short term improvement [57, 58]. Others have previously reported that HTO combined with intra-articular injection of MSCs repairs articular cartilage lesions and improves knee function better than HTO alone [15, 42]. In the current study, we showed that HTO + AD-MSCs significantly reduced the severity of knee OA, as compared to HTO alone, based on MRI and arthroscopic findings. These results support the previous obtained observations.",
        "In the present study we tested, for the first time, the hypothesis that the wide variation in clinical outcomes, previously reported by others, is correlated with the biological variability of each patient’s own (i.e., autologous) MSCs. To test our hypothesis, we stored an aliquot of each patient’s AD-MSCs in liquid nitrogen for future cell studies. We compared the quality of the archived AD-MSCs obtained from patients in the HTO + AD-MSC group: 5 patients showing the most improvement based on ICRS score (sub-group a) and 5 patients showing the least improvement based on ICRS score (sub-group b). Remarkably, proliferation and CFU-F efficiency of all 5 patients in sub-group a were significantly higher than those from the 5 patients in sub-group b during multiple passages and sub-culture (Fig. 4). Since not all the CFU-F are able to differentiate into osteoblasts or adipocytes, the differentiation capacity of the CFU-Fs to CFU-OB and CFU-AD was determined by treatment with osteoblast or adipocyte differentiation media, respectively. The results showed that the majority of CFU-Fs generated by AD-MSCs from patients in sub-group a were able to differentiate into CFU-OB and CFU-AD, many of which were higher than those formed by AD-MSCs from patients in sub-group b (Fig. 4). Moreover, the increased amount of proliferation and ability to form CFUs shown by sub-group a cells might be due to the low level of ROS production and senescent cells present compared to sub-group b cells (Fig. 5). It was also evident that lower amounts of ROS production was associated with the presence of more intact mitochondria in AD-MSCs from the patients showing more improvement in OA symptoms (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results suggest that clinical outcomes are strongly correlated with the stemness and senescence of the autologous AD-MSCs injected into the joint; cell qualities such as the capacity for proliferation, colony formation (reflecting CFU efficiency), and differentiation, and the effects of aging on MSCs (e.g. cellular senescence and intracellular ROS production). The present studies also suggest that although these cell qualities may have the potential to predict clinical outcome, MSC surface markers (e.g. CD90, CD105, and CD73), as recommended by the ISCT for routinely assessing MSC quality, did not demonstrate any potential for predicting efficacy.",
        "A review of the published reports describing the results of MSC-based clinical trials for knee OA, ~ 80% employed autologous MSCs due to biosafety concerns and increasing evidence suggesting that MSCs may not be immune privileged [17]. Our study also indicated that the senescence level of AD-MSCs had a crucial impact on the therapeutic effect. In addition, senescent cells increase with aging and acquire a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) which is characterized by the release of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases, which impair adjacent MSCs and contribute to aging-associated degenerative pathologies [59, 60]. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that oxidative stress in aging caused by dysregulated accumulation of ROS may induce cellular senescence of human MSCs and further affect stem cell function [61, 62]. Since elderly patients are the primary target population for cell-based treatment of age-related diseases such as knee OA, the quality of autologous MSCs are compromised due to aging and further influenced by other diseases (e.g. diabetes, heart disease) and multiple medicines. In particular, patients with autoimmune diseases often take steroids (e.g. glucocorticoids drugs) that can induce apoptosis of MSCs [63, 64]. Interestingly it has been reported that old-MSCs can be rejuvenated by exposure to a young microenvironment [65, 66]. By combining the findings reported in the current study, where the quality of an individual’s own MSCs (autologous MSC therapy) can be predicted with some success, with the ability to rejuvenate MSCs from elderly donors by culture on a young microenvironment, it’s possible that in the future we may be able to predict the likelihood of clinical success using one’s own cells.",
        "There were some limitations in this study. Although we believe that preserving the multiple samples of AD-MSCs from the same individual as the injected cells is already valuable. Cell samples used for in vitro experiments were not from the same culture batch as the injected cells, because the time of individual enrollment is dispersed over years. When conditions permit, direct comparison of the injected cells is preferable. Moreover, large sample size, long-term follow-up studies with further mechanism discussion are still needed in the future to help better understand the safety and therapeutic potential of AD-MSCs.",
        "In summary, our findings strongly support the hypothesis that the inconsistent clinical outcomes of autologous MSC-based therapy are correlated with the variability of the stemness and senescence of the injected MSCs. More importantly, the results indicate that the properties of MSC proliferation and differentiation, CFU efficiency and cell senescence and ROS could be used as sets of criteria to predict the clinical outcomes for autologous MSC-based therapy for knee OA. To improve the clinical efficacy, we propose to rejuvenate autologous MSCs by exposure to a young microenvironment to standardize the stemness and senescence of autologous MSCs prior to the administration. Finally, our study highlights emerging opportunities and trends in precision medicine that could potentially improve autologous MSC-based therapies.",

METHODS: Single-centre, single-blind randomized study of patients with knee OA. Twenty patients were randomized into groups of 10 each for intra-articular injection of cultured BM-MSCs (6 ​ml of BM-MSCs at 1 ​x ​10(6) ​cells/mL) or HA (6 ​ml). Clinical assessments of pain, quality of life, radiographic imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compositional change were performed at baseline and 12 months follow-up. RESULTS: Compared with HA, BM-MSCs injection resulted in significant improvement in qualify of life and reduction in pain as reflected by visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) score collectively. T2-relaxation time tended to decrease more in the BM-MSCs group with a 38 ​+/- ​24.0% reduction in 6 out of 10 BM-MSC participants; while there was only a 12 ​+/- ​7.9% reduction in 4 out of 10 HA participants at the end of follow-up.

        "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease which particularly affects the knee. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of articular cartilage, osteophytosis, subchondral bone sclerosis, and joint inflammation. The socioeconomic burden of OA is considerable. The annual direct and indirect costs, including health care, and lost productivity have recently been estimated as US$28.6 billion [1]. Population-wise, the prevalence for OA is predicted to increase significantly worldwide, including Asia [2,3]. OA also leads to a worsening quality of life and may lead to permanent disability. Medication, physiotherapy, and non-prosthetic surgery are altogether not effective treatment to prevent progressive destruction and pain caused by OA [4,5]. Due to a lack of clinically effective intervention to delay the progressive loss of joint tissues, total knee replacement (TKR) is generally regarded as the ultimate surgical procedure in end stage OA, resulting in enhanced mobility and pain reduction.",
        "Articular cartilage has limited regeneration capability. The provision of exogenous cells with the ability to mediate or generate cartilage-like extracellular matrix is the main reasoning behind the current interest in cell-based therapy for OA. Autologous chondrocytes have been used for decades but the associated donor site morbidity and application limited to small chondral defects due to insufficient cell number prompted a clinical demand for an alternative cell source [6]. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells which can be isolated from various adult tissues and expanded in vitro. MSCs are able to differentiate into chondrogenic cells and other cell types under appropriate culture conditions [7]. MSCs also possess anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effects and other biological functions through the release of bioactive factors [8,9]. These properties emphasise the potential of MSCs as a cell-based therapy for articular cartilage repair in patients with knee OA. Recently, several meta-analyses attempted to summarize the therapeutic effectiveness of MSCs therapy on knee OA [[10], [11], [12]]. Using different review strategies, pooled analysis indicated improved pain relief and certain physical functions following intra-articular injection of MSCs.",
        "Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) was conditionally recommended in patients with knee OA by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) for pain relief [13]. Previous clinical trial compared MSCs with HA in the treatment of OA, in which HA injection was also given to MSCs groups [14]. Clinical trials directly comparing MSCs and HA are limited. In this study, we conducted a randomized control clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a single intra-articular injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) versus HA in patients with knee OA. Clinical and radiological outcomes over a 12 month follow-up were reported.",
        "This was a single-centre randomized study in patients with knee OA conducted between 2015 and 2020. The study aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of intra-articular BM-MSCs against intra-articular HA in patients with knee OA (equal randomization in a 1:1 for two groups). Once the inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed, each participant was randomly assigned to their treatment groups by picking a sealed envelope with the treatment allocation. The prescriptions were assigned according to the randomization process. The study was performed in accordance with the approved institutional ethical protocol (CREC-2014.279-T) and registered in the Centre for Clinical Research Biostatistics - Clinical Trials Registry (CUHK_CCT00469).",
        "Twenty eligible patients, aged between 50 and 65 years (58.00 ​± ​4.51 years), affected by primary OA of the knee of Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade 2–3 and with a pain level equal to or higher than 5 on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale of 10 for at least 2 months were recruited with informed consent. There was no restriction on medication or any other treatment or daily activity by the recruited patients before or after intervention. Patients with the following criteria were excluded: (i) alcoholism or drug abuse; (ii) pregnancy and breast-feeding; (iii) serious pathologies such as carcinoma or autoimmune disease; (iv) hypersensitivity towards HA; (v) on-going or recent (1 month) steroid-based systemic therapy; (vi) significant hematologic disease; (vii) mechanical knee instability, ligamentous laxity or deficiency or gross knee deformity and (viii) prior knee surgery. Patients were randomized into either BM-MSCs group or HA group. All injections were given intra-articularly once into the knee joint. In the BM-MSCs group, 6 ​ml of BM-MSCs (1 ​× ​106 ​cells per ml) was injected, while in the HA group, 6 ​ml of HA (Synvisc-One®: Hylan G-F 20) was injected.",
        "Human bone marrow (10 ​ml) was harvested from the posterior iliac crest under local anaesthesia at least 1-month before injection. Bone marrow nucleated cells were isolated and cultured with standard protocol in clean room facility [15]. In brief, 20 ​ml bone marrow solution diluted in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; 1:1 ratio) was layered on Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM (GE Healthcare, Chicago, USA) before centrifugation at 400g for 30 ​min at 20 ​°C. The layer of buffy coat was collected and washed twice with 3 times the volume of DPBS. the nucleated cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 ​× ​105 ​cells/cm2 in culture medium (KO-DMEM supplemented with 1% Glutamax and 10% fetal bovine serum) which was changed twice a week. At 70% confluent, the cells were collected with Tryple, then resuspended in the culture medium, and seeded at a density of 5000 ​cells/cm2 in culture flask. Cell culture with viability above 86% as determined by trypan blue exclusion test was used. International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) recommendations were adopted for MSC characterization [7,16]. At passage 3, BM-MSCs cell suspension was washed twice with DPBS, re-suspended in 200 ​μl stain buffer (BD, 1 ​× ​106 ​cells/ml) and incubated for 15 ​min at 4 ​°C. Primary antibodies against CD14, CD19, CD29, CD34, CD44, CD45, CD73, CD90, HLA-DR or corresponding isotype controls were added to each suspension and incubated for 15 ​min at 4 ​°C with gentle intermittent shaking before subjecting to flow cytometry. In addition, the multi-differentiation potential and clonogenicity of the BM-MSCs were evaluated with standard staining protocols. One hundred BM-MSCs were seeded per 10 ​cm diameter culture dish and stained with 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) at day 14. The BM-MSCs at passage 3 were subjected to iosteogenic, adipogenic or chondrogenic induction using commercially available differentiation kits (StemPro, Gibco, Massachusetts, USA), followed by staining of calcium deposits by 0.5% alizarin red S (pH 4.1 adjusted with ammonia, Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA), intracellular oil droplets by 0.3% freshly filtered oil red O (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA), or type II collagen in micromass culture by immunohistochemical staining with anti-type II collagen (Santa Cruz, California, USA) respectively as we previously reported [17,18]. BM-MSCs at passage 5 were used for intra-articular injection. All the reagents were purchased from Life Technologies (California, USA) unless otherwise specified.",

Patients were scanned in the supine position on a 3.0-T system (Achieva TX, Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) with a dedicated knee coil to optimize signal reception. MR sequences were as follows: proton density-weighted sagittal (FOV 160 ​× ​90mm; TR 4000 ​ms; TE 30 ​ms; slice thickness 2.5 ​mm; flip angle: 90°); proton density-weighted SPAIR (spectral attenuated inversion recovery) axial (FOV 150 ​× ​150 ​mm; TR 6221 ​ms; TE 62 ​ms; slice thickness 3 ​mm; flip angle: 90°); and T2-mapping sagittal (FOV 160 ​× ​66mm; TR 2000 ​ms; TE 13 ​ms; slice thickness 2.5 ​mm; flip angle: 90°). Total scanning time was about 20–25 ​min. T2-mapped sagittal MR images were evaluated by one radiologist, blinded to the clinical data. ROIs (regions of interest) for cartilage T2 mapping was performed on serial sagittal images (24 slices) on a standard MR workstation (Philips Intellispace, Best, Netherlands) using a standard MR cartilage assessment tool available on this workstation. ROIs were drawn for different knee cartilage areas (retropatellar, femoral trochlear, medial femorotibial, lateral femorotibial) on consecutive sagittal images, the results summated, and an average value for T2 mapping in millisecond (ms) calculated for each knee. Lower T2-values signify healthier articular cartilage.",
        "VAS pain score is the most reported significant benefit in MSCs therapy. According to the VAS score reported in a relevant clinical trials at the time of protocol preparation, a sample size of 10 would allow for a mean difference of 2.76 and population variance of 7.46 with 80% power and significance level of 0.05 to detect a difference between the two groups. All the enrolled participants received treatment and completed assessments at baseline and at least two follow-up time points. All the pain and functional questionnaires were answered. Participants did not come back for every follow-up assessment were still included in the statistsical analysis owing to small sample size of this pilot study. Data was presented as mean ​± ​standard deviation or as median (lower quartile, upper quartile) where appropriate. Differences between groups at particular time points were analyzed using two-sample t test with Welch's correction and Mann-Whitney U test for normally distributed data with unequal variance and non-normally distributed data, respectively. Changes in the parameters for each subject were calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the value at each timepoint during the follow-up period. Changes in the parameters were analysed by fitting linear mixed-effects models with Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation, where groups (BM-MSCs group Vs HA group) was considered as fixed effects and within-individual variation was adjusted as random effects. If significant effects were identified by the linear mixed-effects models, hypothesis tests for pairwise comparisons between BM-MSCs and HA groups were performed using Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistics were performed using R 4.0.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA).",

        "All participants completed clinical assessments before injection and at 12 months post-injection for the primary outcome. For the secondary outcome, one participant in the HA group failed to complete the WOMAC assessment at the 12 months time-point. There were no observed complications. One patient in the BM-MSCs group required a second bone marrow aspiration procedure because the first aspiration failed to reach sufficient yield of BM-MSCs for injection. BM-MSCs injection resulted in significant reduction in VAS score at rest during the 12 months follow-up periods, while HA resulted in score increase post-injection (between-group difference, −2.91; 95% CI, −4.98 to −0.84; P ​= ​0.007). A similar trend was found for VAS score during physical activity or with burden with statistical significance reached by the differences in VAS score with burden (between-group difference, −2.93; 95% CI, −4.85 to −1.02; P ​= ​0.003) (Fig. 3 and Table 3). KSS and KSFS scores over the 12 months study period showed an increasing trend in the BM-MSCs group, though this did not reach statistical significance compared to HA (Fig. 4 and Table 3). BM-MSCs showed a significantly decrease in WOMAC total score (between-group difference, −15.52; 95% CI, −31.00 to −0.04; P ​= ​0.049), WOMAC pain score (between-group difference, −3.32; 95% CI, −6.52 to −0.12; P ​= ​0.042) and WOMAC percentage score (between-group difference, −16.17; 95% CI, −32.30 to −0.04; P ​= ​0.049) than that in HA group post intervention. WOMAC stiffness and physical function was similarly improved in the BM-MSCs group but not reaching statistical significance compared to the HA group (P ​= ​0.641 and P ​= ​0.444) (Fig. 5 and Table 3). For the SF-36 score, compared with the HA group, an improvement of the physical functioning score (between-group difference, 14.38; 95% CI, 4.58 to 24.18; P ​= ​0.005), the bodily pain score (between-group difference, 25.26; 95% CI, 7.69 to 42.82; P ​= ​0.005) and the physical component score (between-group difference, 9.03; 95% CI, 2.81 to 15.25; P ​= ​0.005) was noticed in the BM-MSCs group (Fig. 6 and Table 3). Based on subscale analysis, the improvement in the physical component score was mainly attributed to the significantly better score for bodily pain, including more freedom from pain. Vitality and mental health were the two main features that contributed to the significant improvement in the mental component score. In addition, BM-MSCs injection significantly led to higher physical functioning at 9 month post injection.Figure 3Changes of VAS pain score during the one-year follow-up period after intra-articular injection of BM-MSCs (circle) and HA (square).

        "Similar to previously reported studies, no adverse effects were reported by the participants. Since completion of the study, one of the 10 patients in the BM-MSCs group underwent TKR. All of the other participants have remained clinically stable. The pooled data of a previous meta-analysis [11] showed that the total rate of minor AE in MSCs group was 16.5% and 21.42% in control group, ranging from 2.5% to 60% per study, which did not reach a significant difference and the degree of variability between trials seemed to be raised by chance.",
        "Compositional change in the articular cartilage was evaluated by T2 mapping on serial MRI examinations. MRI is regarded as a standard non-invasive imaging assessment for determining cartilage status. Change in cartilage composition including proteoglycan loss, deterioration of collagen structure, and increased cartilage water content are reflected by T2 relaxation time measurement. Higher MRI T2 values are seen in patients with mild to severe OA [19], reflecting more severe cartilage degeneration [20]. MRI analysis indicated that BM-MSCs treatment resulted in a more pronounced reduction in T2 relaxation time, except for two subjects receiving BM-MSCs injection who showed an increasing trend of T2-relaxation time, indicative of progressive cartilage degeneration. In general, our findings were in line with the results of recent meta-analysis, which showed that BM-MSCs therapy was more effective in alleviating pain and improving self-reported function with an average follow-up period of 14 months [10,12,21].",
        "A more recent meta-analysis on MSCs therapy without adjuvant therapy reported that cultured MSCs therapy resulted in better clinical outcome in terms of pain reduction in patients with knee OA compared to uncultured MSCs [10]. As the clinical outcome of MSC therapy and the chondrogenic potential of MSCs might be associated with passage number [22,23], BM-MSCs at passage 5 were used for intervention in this study which was widely adopted by other similar RCTs for knee OA though there was yet no consensus regarding this issue. Unlike previous RCTs in which 80 ​ml bone marrow or more was aspirated for MSCs isolation [24,25], only 10 ​ml bone marrow was aspirated in this pilot study to reduce the possibility of obtaining low number of nucleated cells and potentially lower yield of MSCs in second aspirates [26]. Although this resulted in a lower MSC yield, this intervention with fewer MSCs still resulted in a similar clinical outcome compared with other RCTs that injected larger numbers of MSCs [14,25]. This suggests that a lower dose of injected MSC might not adversely affect clinical outcome. Unlike drugs or biologics which have a clearly defined and homogenous chemical structure, MSCs-based medicinal products can be regarded as a heterogeneous cell population with considerable batch-to-batch variation and, as such, variance in clinical outcome is expected. In the absence of any validated potency assay, the identity of MSCs relies on the harmonized criteria proposed by ISCT based on the plastic adherence, mutipotency, and the expression of a panel of surface markers [7]. The expression of surface markers might not be directly related to the cellular activity of MSCs or clinical outcome. Compared with younger subjects, human BM-MSCs isolated from elderly subjects usually have lower ability to form colonies and to differentiate into different lineages, and exhibit variable transcriptome and cytokine profiles, though the BM-MSCs from aged and younger donors have similar expression level of negative and positive markers [27]. In this study, we also noticed variation in the expression of positive markers (particularly CD29 and CD73), while the negative markers were found consistently absent (<2%) in all samples, indicating successful removal of hemopoietic lineage cells. A survey within the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation revealed that the threshold percentage of negative (ranging from <1% to <20%) and positive (ranging from >70% to >95%) surface markers for MSCs medicinal products varied in different manufacturing centers [28]. After reviewing the clinical assessment data and the surface markers expression, it appeared that the different expression level of positive markers were not associated with clinical outcome. Allogeneic MSCs have been found to show potential benefits in patients with knee OA [25,29], which could be used as a more reliable source for MSCs therapy. On the other hand, recent studies suggest various approaches to augment the therapeutic outcome of MSCs therapy for OA, including the use of cell-free exosomes as alternative to MSCs-based therapy [30,31], or the co- or pre-treatment of small molecules to enhance the cellular activity of MSCs [32,33], which are warranted for further investigation in clinical setting to advance the clinical application of MSCs-related advanced medicinal products for OA.",
        "There are several limitations in this study. First, subjects in the BM-MSCs group were aware of BM-MSCs treatment as they were all subjected to bone marrow aspiration. Such awareness might lead to higher follow-up compliance in the BM-MSCs group. Loss of follow-up data, particularly in the HA group, limited the continuous variables available for repeated measure analysis to assess effect change over time. As an alternative, the effect was analyzed by linear mixed-effects models. Nevertheless, retention strategy should be considered in further studies particularly when a larger sample and a longer follow up duration are involved. MRI assessment, as employed in the present study, did not provide unequivocal evidence of cartilage regeneration compared to baseline though greater reduction in T2-values with treatment were shown compared to the HA group. Arthroscopic examination and biopsy were not undertaken due to ethical concerns. BM-MSCs were injected as a suspension and, as such, the retention of the injected BM-MSCs at the OA site could not be been guaranteed. Fibrin glue or other clinically approved biomaterials should be considered in future studies to ensure more targeted delivery of the BM-MSCs to the main areas of interest. In the present study, we understood that concomitant or rescue pain medication may lead to improved patient-reported outcomes (PRO), however, considering the nature of this pilot study and cell therapy was a very new kind of treatment option to local patients, it might lead to a higher dropout rate and poor adherence during follow-up assessment if we employed more stringent recruitment criteria, such as not allowing pain medications throughout the study. In this study, provided that majority of recruited subjects are in the early stages of OA (KL grade 2) and seldom take medication for pain relief, it is reasonable to believe that the effect of concomitant pain medication in our pilot study is very limited. Nevertheless, further clinical trial in this subject area should be conducted with caution as previously recommended [34].",
        "Overall, BM-MSCs treatment appears to result in more favorable outcomes in patients with knee OA in terms of pain reduction and some self-reported functions. The small sample size of this pilot study, however, did not enable the effect of potential confounding effect due to medication and rehabilitation programs and other potential cofounder during follow up to be assessed.",

        "Graphical Abstract",
        "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex degenerative articular disorder characterized by the degeneration of articular cartilage, resulting in damage to the articular tissue, which consequently leads to impaired joint function. Because of its avascular nature and the limited self-renewal capacity of chondrocytes, adult articular cartilage presents limited repair capability, and the optimal treatment of knee OA remains unknown\n1\n. Most conventional pharmacological therapies concentrate on relieving pain in the knee joint. For severe cases of knee OA, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the only therapeutic option\n2\n. However, TKA is associated with the risk of general anesthesia and postoperative (surgery-related) complications. Therefore, identifying safe and effective alternative treatments for OA is essential.",
        "Intra-articular (IA) injection into the knee joint may be suitable for individuals who are unable to take oral medications or wish to avoid surgical treatment. IA injections primarily provide short-term symptom relief and reduce pain and function. Molecules such as corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid (HA), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) have been used as IA injection treatments\n3\n. However, these treatments currently have major limitations in terms of timing, frequency, and efficacy. Therefore, further studies are required to investigate new molecules and/or therapies associated with IA injections for knee OA.",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), recognized for their extensive proliferative ability, exhibit immunomodulatory properties associated with their potential to facilitate cartilage repair and improve knee function. While numerous clinical trials have shown that using MSCs for treating knee OA is safe and effective, questions remain regarding its effectiveness, how it works, the best timing for injections, and the proper dosage of MSCs\n4\n.",
        "Several studies have compared the effects of MSCs with those of a placebo or HA. Some of these studies found better overall functional improvement and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-identified cartilage quality improvement in the MSC group5–7. Recently, several MRI techniques such as T2 mapping, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), gagCEST, and dGEMRIC have been used to perform compositional imaging of the cartilage and selectively visualize the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen fiber network of the extracellular matrix (ECM). However, studies on the IA injection of MSCs in OA using these MRI techniques are lacking\n8\n.",
        "This double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical study examined the effect of a single IA injection of human allogeneic bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs compared with that of normal saline (placebo) in knee OA. In this study, we evaluated the safety of IA injection of MSCs into the knee and the effects of symptom relief on knee OA. We also attempted to clarify the regenerative potential of MSCs by reporting pre- and post-injection MRI T2 quantitative mapping data. We hypothesized that pain relief in MSC-treated knees would continue for several months through the prevention of cartilage damage detected by MRI.",
        "This single-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted between November 2019 and June 2022 at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital (Seoul, Korea). Random allocation with a computer-assisted method was based on a 1:1 ratio between the intervention and control groups. The study used a permuted-block randomization method to ensure balanced allocation of participants across treatment groups, with blocks of varying sizes randomly assigned to minimize predictability. This approach helps maintain an equal distribution of participants throughout the study. The process of randomization and allocation was conducted by medical personnel who were not involved in any other aspects of the study. Throughout the study, neither the participants nor investigators were aware of the group allocations. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier used was NCT04240873. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital of the Catholic University of Korea (KC19CNSI0469). All participants provided written informed consent.",
        "Patients diagnosed with primary knee OA, based on the American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria, were selected for participation\n9\n. Patients were eligible if they (a) were between 20–80 years of age; (b) exhibited Kellgren–Lawrence (K–L) Grade I–IV confirmed via radiography; (c) had a visual analog scale (VAS) score exceeding 50 mm at baseline; (d) had not seen improvement after at least 3 months of non-surgical treatment; and (e) voluntarily provided informed consent for enrollment. Individuals were excluded if they (a) had received IA injections of corticosteroids or HA in the past 3 months; (b) could not ambulate; or (c) were concurrently using anti-inflammatory medications. The study sample size was determined to achieve a statistical significance threshold (α) of 0.05 and a power of 0.80.",
        "Human BM-MSCs, Catholic MASTER cells, were sourced from the Catholic Institute of Cell Therapy (CIC) in Seoul, Korea. Bone marrow (BM) was obtained from healthy individuals between the ages of 20 and 55 years via aspiration from the iliac crest, with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital. A single donor’s BM was selected from various BM donations and sent to the CIC’s facility which adheres to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards for the isolation, growth, and quality assurance processes of BM-MSCs. The bone marrow was centrifuged at 4°C and 793 × g for 7 min to obtain the marrow pellet. After centrifugation, sterile distilled water was applied in a 10:1 ratio to eliminate red blood cells (RBCs). The RBC-depleted marrow pellets were then resuspended in an MSC growth medium provided by GE Healthcare (Seoul, Korea), enriched with 20% fetal bovine serum (also from GE Healthcare), and cultured in T-75 tissue culture flasks (Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. This growth medium was consistently used throughout cell expansion, with medium changes occurring biweekly. Once cell confluence reached approximately 70% to 90%, the cells were harvested and seeded at a density of 5–8 × 103 cells/cm2 for further expansion. This expansion occurred over 2–4 passages in a GMP-certified environment. Throughout the cell expansion phase, tests for mycoplasma and bacterial sterility, along with endotoxin levels (below 3 EU/ml), were conducted. Post-fourth passage, the cells were assessed for surface marker expression (CD90/CD73, over 95% positive; CD34/CD45, over 95% negative) and their ability to differentiate into multiple cell types.",
        "Twenty-six patients were recruited, and 24 patients were randomized (Fig. 1). An IA injection of MSCs (1 × 108 cells/2 ml) or placebo (normal saline, 2 ml) was administered. After positioning the patient supine with a pillow under the knee to achieve approximately 30° of joint flexion, thorough antiseptic measures were applied. A high-frequency linear ultrasonography probe was used to scan the suprapatellar recess of the knees. Next, ultrasound-guided knee joint injection with a 20-gauge needle was performed by a rheumatologist (J.J.L.) who was skilled in knee injection.",

        "The primary outcomes were changes in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Pain and knee joint function outcomes were assessed using a VAS of 0–100 mm, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The WOMAC score includes 24 items of pain (0–20), stiffness (0–8), and physical function (0–68), with a total score of 96\n9\n. The KOOS is a self-administered questionnaire used to evaluate participants’ opinions regarding their knee problems through five specific subscales: pain, symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), sport and recreation, and quality of life (QOL)\n10\n. A single evaluator conducted assessments of all primary outcomes at baseline and again at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.",
        "Quantitative T2 mapping of the articular cartilage along with standard knee MRI sequences was performed at baseline and at 3 and 12 months. MR was performed using a 3 T scanner (Magnetom Vida; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). The imaging protocol consisted of intermediate-weighted two-dimensional turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences with three orthogonal planes, a three-dimensional proton density-weighted TSE, and a multiecho spin-echo T2-weighted sequence for T2 mapping with the following parameters: field of view, 150 × 150 mm; pixel matrix, 384 × 230; repetition time ms/echo time ms, 3170/11.5, 23, 34.5, 46, 57.5, 69, 80.5, and 92; bandwidth, 241 Hz/pixel; and total acquisition time, 4 min 35 s. T2 maps were generated using commercial software (MapIt; Siemens Healthcare). Increased T2 values indicated a disorganized collagen microstructure and a resultant increase in the water content of the cartilage. Image registration among the three time points and region-of-interest (ROI) placement were performed using the ITK-SNAP software, version 3.8.0 (open source, http://www.itksnap.org/)\n11\n. Cartilages were divided into 14 subregions based on the MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) system\n12\n. The registered MR images from the three time points were uploaded side-by-side, and ROIs were manually located at the same location among the three time points by one musculoskeletal radiologist (J.Y.J.) with 13 years of clinical experience. Measurements were only performed when the cartilage retained more than 50% of its native thickness. After the measurements were repeated three times, all T2 values were recorded as representative and independent values for each subregion at each time point. Subregions were aggregated to establish three distinct compartments: the patellofemoral, incorporating both the patella and trochlea; the medial, composed of the medial femur’s central and posterior segments, alongside the medial tibia’s anterior, central, and posterior sections; and the lateral, consisting of the lateral femur’s central and posterior parts, in addition to the lateral tibia’s anterior, central, and posterior areas\n13\n.",
        "For biochemical analyses, fasted venous blood samples were collected in the morning at the beginning of the study and after 3 and 12 months of treatment. The bone turnover markers osteocalcin (OC) and carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) were measured along with inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate).",
        "During the monitoring phase, the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) in the index knee, including heating sensation, redness, tenderness, joint effusion, and limitations in range of motion, were recorded. Patients were advised against using any prescribed or non-prescribed analgesics if they experienced no pain and were instructed to record any emergency medication utilized, including its use period and frequency. The safety assessment included vital signs, laboratory tests, and physical examination findings. AEs were categorized as serious, treatment-related, or discontinuation owing to AEs. The severity of AEs was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE)\n14\n.",
        "Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA) and R version 3.1.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The evaluation was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach, incorporating all data from participants randomly assigned to their respective groups. A significance threshold (P-value) was established at 0.05 to test all hypotheses. For categorical data, both absolute (n) and relative (%) frequencies were calculated. Normally distributed quantitative data are reported as mean values along with their standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for these means were also derived. Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the relationship between baseline categorical variables. The distribution normality of quantitative data was assessed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk tests. Changes from baseline to each subsequent time point within groups were described using means and 95% CIs. For comparative analyses, we utilized the unpaired Student’s t-test, the Mann–Whitney U test, the paired Student’s t-test, and the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, depending on the context.",
        "The study adhered to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, and a flow diagram is shown in Fig. 1. After screening 26 patients, 24 patients were included in the study and randomized into one of the two study groups. During the follow-up period, 1 participant withdrew from the trial, and 23 participants, including 12 in the control group and 11 in the MSC group, completed the 12-month sessions and underwent pre-post assessments.",

Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups in terms of sex, K–L grade, body mass index (BMI), and knee index.

        "Figure 4 details the change of T2 values using quantitative T2 cartilage mapping MRI at baseline and 3 and 12 months following placebo or MSC IA injection in three compartments of the knee cartilage (medial, lateral, and patellofemoral). Upon examining the changes in T2 values within the medial compartment over the study period, distinct patterns emerged between the control and MSC groups. Specifically, the mean T2 values (ms) increased progressively over time, starting from a baseline mean of 38.83 (95% CI: 36.87, 40.79). This upward trajectory continued at 3 months, with a mean T2 value of 41.62 (95% CI: 39.62, 43.61), culminating in a further increase to 44.04 (95% CI: 41.97, 46.11) at 12 months. Conversely, the MSC group demonstrated a slightly different pattern. Starting from a baseline mean T2 value of 40.04 (95% CI: 37.53, 42.55), there was a modest increase to 40.91 (95% CI: 38.46, 43.36) at 3 months. At the 12-month interval, the mean T2 value for the MSC group was 41.81 (95% CI: 39.31, 44.31), indicating a less pronounced increase over time compared with the control group. At 12 months, the MSC group showed a moderate increase in T2 values, which was statistically significant (P = 0.013) compared with that of the control group. In contrast, as observed in Fig. 4, unlike the medial compartment, no statistical significance was found in the lateral (P = 0.364) and patellofemoral (P = 0.189) compartments. Figure 5 presents representative images of quantitative T2 mapping, showing increased T2 values in the articular cartilage of the medial femoral condyle over 12 months in a control group patient, while the MSC group patient exhibits only a mild increase.",

Grade 2 AEs occurred in four patients with decreased joint function in the MSC group, and these patients were treated with only oral medication. Grade 3 AEs requiring IA corticosteroid injection and interfering with patients’ ADLs occurred in three patients in the MSC group.

        "The results of the current study demonstrated that IA injection of allogenic BM-MSCs (Catholic MASTER cells) was safe and effective for the clinical improvement of knee OA. Structural changes in knee OA evaluated using quantitative T2 cartilage mapping MRI showed a significant preventive effect on the degenerative progression of the cartilage at 12 months. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show the potential efficacy of a single-dose administration of allogeneic BM-MSCs via IA injection, supported by a comprehensive serial analysis through quantitative T2 cartilage mapping MRI evaluations.",
        "The presence of an inflammatory environment, such as synovitis, within the joint plays a pivotal role in the development of OA, subsequently leading to the advancement of joint dysfunction\n15\n. MSCs exhibit a remarkable ability to alleviate inflammatory conditions by modulating immune cell properties. The regulatory effect of MSCs on the immune system has captured significant interest because of their potential allogeneic applications\n16\n. Although the therapeutic potential of autologous BM-MSCs has been widely investigated, harvesting these cells is an invasive procedure. More critically, autologous BM-MSCs harvested from older patients exhibit limitations in both quantity and quality\n17\n. Our research used Catholic MASTER cells obtained from the bone marrow of young and healthy donors. These cells may possess superior immunomodulatory functions compared with senescent MSCs, and several studies have reported their effects in this regard18,19. The superiority of the MSC source might have played a role in the positive therapeutic outcomes observed in our study.",
        "The findings of this study demonstrate the safety of IA injection of BM-MSCs into osteoarthritic knees, despite prior concerns regarding the potential AEs associated with MSC IA injections. In the early phase following treatment, the most prevalent AEs associated with the procedure in the MSC group were pain and swelling of the knee, which were observed in 75.0% of cases. Similarly, recent clinical studies on IA injection of MSCs have consistently reported these AEs, and none of the participants experienced SAEs or AEs leading to study discontinuation\n20\n. Another recent study indicated that the surgical implantation of MSCs derived from allogenic umbilical cords was safe, with no treatment-related SAEs or immune rejection over 7 years, even considering their allogeneic application\n21\n. These outcomes align with our results, showing the safety of IA injections of MSCs. However, additional studies are required to assess potential AEs over the mid- to long-term.",
        "Numerous studies have evaluated the outcomes of IA injections of MSCs versus normal saline, providing a consistent and encouraging finding: IA administration of MSCs in patients with knee OA results in significant pain reduction and enhancement of function in the short term22–25. Our study also suggests that IA injection of allogeneic BM-MSCs results in remarkable pain relief in patients with knee OA. Over a 12-month period, at all time points, MSCs induced an improvement in the pain index compared with baseline, while the control solution did not. This single injection of BM-MSCs led to remarkably greater reductions in the WOMAC and KOOS pain scores at 9 months compared with those in the control group. However, these differences did not persist after 12 months. This suggests that repeated IA injections at intervals of several months could produce long-term and continuous pain relief.",
        "Another interesting finding from this study is the decrease in serum CTX-I levels at 3 months in the MSC group compared with that in the control group. Cytokine-driven inflammatory reactions, involving molecules such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, promote bone loss by regulating the differentiation and function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. This activation in bone resorption, in turn, causes a rise in bone turnover and a reduction in bone mineral density\n26\n. In our study, there was no change in serum inflammatory markers after the IA injection of MSCs, but a decrease in bone resorption markers was observed. These findings suggest that IA injection of MSCs induces a local, rather than a systemic, immunomodulatory effect. Although the number of participants in our study was small, this finding suggests that this local anti-inflammatory effect can have a positive effect on bone turnover and mineral density.",
        "The capacity of MSCs to repair and regenerate cartilaginous tissues in joints is currently unclear. Multi-compositional MRI sequences offer a means to assess the progression of cartilage damage by analyzing the serial compositional changes in knee cartilage. This imaging modality can provide valuable insights for evaluating treatment efficacy and determining the appropriate course of treatment for patients. T2 mapping is an innovative technique in molecular imaging crafted for the early detection of OA because it identifies biochemical changes before any morphological changes occur. Numerous studies have established a link between cartilage deterioration and T2 values27,28, with elevated T2 values being indicative of articular cartilage in individuals at risk for OA\n29\n. We aimed to measure the difference in the T2 values at baseline and after IA injection of MSCs to quantitatively evaluate the effect of MSCs on knee cartilage. In our quantitative T2 MRI cartilage analysis, the medial compartment of the knee cartilage in the MSC group showed lower rates of increase in the T2 values between baseline and 12 months than that in the control group. In knee OA, the medial compartment is more commonly affected and often more severely affected than the lateral compartment\n30\n. These results reinforce the concept that IA injection of MSCs slows cartilage degeneration in knee OA.",
        "Our study had some limitations. First, the study’s limited sample size restricts its ability to discern differences, raising the risk of a false-negative outcome. Second, the small cohort size precluded the possibility of conducting subgroup analyses, such as distinct evaluations of groups based on the index knee and baseline K–L grade. Third, the use of permuted-block randomization led to an imbalance in the baseline characteristics of the samples. Finally, owing to ethical considerations, the potential effects of MSCs on cartilage could not be assessed through cartilage biopsy, which would have shed light on the mechanisms underlying pain alleviation. Conversely, a major advantage of this study is its selection of a homogenous study population based on BMI and K–L grade. Furthermore, as a single-center study supported by the CIC, consistency in the preparation and injection of MSCs was ensured.",
        "In conclusion, a single IA injection of allogeneic BM-MSCs safely provided pain relief in patients with knee OA and prevented the radiological progression of degenerative knee cartilage. These findings suggest the potential use of IA injection of allogeneic BM-MSCs as a pain-relieving and disease-modifying treatment for patients with knee OA in the outpatient setting.",

    "title": "Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for knee osteoarthritis: 5 years follow-up of three patients. destruction of joint cartilage. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found in low numbers in normal cartilage, mainly in the superficial layer, acting as repairing agents. In OA, MSCs are seen in larger numbers, but act chaotic and are unable to repair the cartilage. The synovial membrane becomes inflamed and interacts with the cartilage. Transplanted MSC have the ability to normalize them, redirecting them to their normal function. In a preliminary study, we showed that MSC could improve knee OA in four patients at 6 months. This report shows their long-term follow-up at 5 years. METHODS: One patient was lost to follow-up at 2 years and three were followed for 5 years. They were aged 55, 57, 65 and 54 years, and had moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis. The worse knee of each patient was injected with 8-9 x 10(6) MSC. RESULTS: As previously reported, all parameters improved in transplant knees at 6 months (walking time, stair climbing, gelling pain, patella crepitus, flection contracture and the visual analogue score on pain). Then, they started gradually to deteriorate, but at 5 years they were still better than at baseline. PGA (Patient Global Assessment) improved from baseline to 5 years. The better knee at baseline (no MSC), continued its progression toward aggravation and at 5 years became the worse knee. CONCLUSION: Transplant knees were all in a rather advanced stage of OA. Earlier transplantation may give better results in long-term follow-up. This is what future studies have to demonstrate. Asia Pty Ltd. Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Hospital, Tehran, Iran.

        "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major contributor to pain and disability globally, characterized by progressive cartilage degeneration, chronic synovial inflammation, and structural joint deterioration. Current non-surgical treatments, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intra-articular corticosteroids, and hyaluronic acid injections, offer symptomatic relief but do not halt disease progression. With limited therapeutic options short of surgical intervention, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has emerged as a promising regenerative approach. MSCs exert anti-inflammatory effects through IL-10 and TGF-β secretion, modulate inflammation, promote tissue repair, and improve joint function [1,2].",
        "Among MSC sources, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) have gained significant interest due to their high yield, ease of extraction, and strong proliferative potential. Compared to bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), AD-MSCs can be harvested through minimally invasive liposuction and demonstrate potent paracrine activity, facilitating cartilage repair and immune modulation [3,4]. However, despite increasing clinical investigations, several key uncertainties remain, including the comparative efficacy of autologous vs. allogeneic AD-MSCs, the optimal dosing strategy, and long-term safety considerations [5].",
        "Autologous vs. allogeneic AD-MSC therapy: mechanisms and clinical potential",
        "AD-MSCs exert their therapeutic effects primarily through paracrine signaling, secreting cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular vesicles that modulate immune responses, reduce inflammation, and promote extracellular matrix remodeling. These properties are particularly beneficial in OA, where chronic inflammation accelerates cartilage degradation [6].",
        "AD-MSCs can be autologous (from the patient’s own tissue) or allogeneic (from a donor). Autologous AD-MSCs are considered advantageous due to their immune compatibility, reduced risk of rejection, and potentially longer persistence in the joint environment. Conversely, allogeneic AD-MSCs offer an off-the-shelf treatment option with potentially stronger immunomodulatory effects but may carry a risk of immune recognition and clearance. Some studies suggest that autologous AD-MSCs provide more rapid pain relief, whereas allogeneic AD-MSCs contribute to sustained regenerative effects. Emerging evidence also suggests that therapeutic efficacy may be dose-dependent, with higher cell doses potentially yielding stronger and longer-lasting effects [7]. However, optimal dosing thresholds remain unclear and are rarely compared across studies.",
        "Need for a comprehensive comparative analysis",
        "Despite increasing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating AD-MSC therapy, variability in study designs, treatment protocols, follow-up durations, and outcome measures has led to conflicting conclusions [8]. While prior meta-analyses have evaluated MSC therapy for OA, none have fully addressed the comparative effectiveness of autologous versus allogeneic AD-MSCs across different doses. Our study addresses this gap using a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA), which provides a powerful solution by integrating direct and indirect evidence to enable the comparison of multiple AD-MSC treatment regimens within a unified analytical framework to rank treatment strategies. By evaluating outcomes across multiple time points, we aim to clarify the most effective and safest AD-MSC regimens for knee OA management, with implications for clinical decision-making and trial design.",
        "Study objectives",
        "This systematic review, pairwise and network meta-analysis, aims to comprehensively evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of low-dose allogeneic, high-dose allogeneic, and high-dose autologous AD-MSC therapy for knee OA. The primary outcomes include pain relief, measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and functional improvement, assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at three, six, and 12 months. Additionally, the study examines the adverse effect (AE) profile of different AD-MSC regimens to identify the most effective intervention based on Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. To ensure the reliability of findings, we perform consistency testing to assess the validity of direct and indirect comparisons within the NMA framework.",
        "Hypothesis and Study Significance",
        "This study hypothesizes that high-dose autologous AD-MSCs will provide rapid pain relief due to their more potent early anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs will demonstrate superior long-term functional improvement due to prolonged immune modulation and regenerative activity.",
        "This study aims to generate data-driven insights into the best AD-MSC treatment strategy for knee OA by integrating direct and indirect evidence from multiple RCTs. By doing so, it aims to support the development of standardized protocols for regenerative medicine. Findings from this meta-analysis may also inform future clinical trials and help refine patient selection criteria, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic potential of AD-MSC therapy in OA management.\nA visual overview of the AD-MSC treatment process and clinical endpoints is presented in Figure 1.",

        "The research question was framed using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) model. The population consisted of adults diagnosed with mild to severe knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II-IV). The intervention included intra-articular injections of adipose-derived MSCs, categorized into low-dose allogeneic, high-dose allogeneic, and high-dose autologous MSCs. The comparators were placebo and standard care (e.g., corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid injections, physical therapy).",
        "The primary outcomes assessed were pain relief (VAS) and functional improvement (WOMAC) at three, six, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included treatment durability over time, adverse events, and the necessity for surgical intervention, such as knee replacement.",
        "Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria",
        "This meta-analysis included RCTs evaluating intra-articular AD-MSC therapy for knee OA in adults (≥18 years) diagnosed using validated criteria such as the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system (Grade II-IV). The eligible studies administered adipose-derived MSCs as single or multiple intra-articular injections with defined cell doses and preparation protocols. Comparators included placebo (e.g., saline) and standard care (e.g., hyaluronic acid, corticosteroids, physical therapy). Studies were required to report at least one primary outcome related to pain relief (VAS, Numeric Pain Rating Scale {NPRS}) or functional improvement (WOMAC). Only peer-reviewed RCTs with a minimum six-month follow-up, published in English between January 1, 2010, and January 1, 2025, were included.",
        "Studies were excluded if they involved non-human subjects, pediatric populations, or OA secondary to inflammatory conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Trials using MSCs from non-adipose sources or systemic administration were excluded unless adipose-derived MSC outcomes were separately reported. Studies incorporating MSCs with non-standard adjunctive treatments (e.g., gene therapy) or surgical procedures were excluded unless MSC-specific outcomes were independently analyzed. Additionally, non-randomized studies, case reports, reviews, abstracts, preprints, theses, unpublished data, and studies with less than six months of follow-up or published in non-English languages without reliable translations were not considered to maintain methodological rigor.",
        "Search Strategy",
        "A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy for knee osteoarthritis. These databases were selected to ensure broad coverage of published trials across diverse clinical and geographical contexts.",
        "We constructed our search strategy based on two main concepts: AD-MSCs and knee OA. For the AD-MSCs concept, we used keywords such as adipose stem cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, adipose-derived MSCs, adipose tissue stem cells, intra-articular MSC therapy, adipose-derived regenerative cells, stem cell injection, stem cell therapy, and adipose-derived stromal cells. The associated MeSH terms included Mesenchymal Stem Cells [MeSH], Adipose Tissue [MeSH], Stem Cell Transplantation [MeSH], Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy [MeSH], and Regenerative Medicine [MeSH]. For knee OA, we included keywords such as knee osteoarthritis, osteoarthritis of the knee, degenerative knee joint disease, knee joint arthritis, degenerative joint disease, osteoarthrosis of the knee, and knee cartilage degeneration, and MeSH terms such as Osteoarthritis, Knee [MeSH], Arthritis [MeSH], Knee Joint [MeSH], and Osteoarthritis [MeSH].",
        "These concepts were combined using Boolean operators (AND, OR) to build the advanced search string: (adipose stem cells OR mesenchymal stromal cells OR adipose-derived MSCs OR adipose tissue stem cells OR intra-articular MSC therapy OR adipose-derived regenerative cells OR stem cell injection OR stem cell therapy OR adipose-derived stromal cells OR Mesenchymal Stem Cells [MeSH] OR Adipose Tissue [MeSH] OR Stem Cell Transplantation [MeSH] OR Cell and Tissue-Based Therapy [MeSH] OR Regenerative Medicine [MeSH]) AND (knee osteoarthritis OR osteoarthritis of the knee OR degenerative knee joint disease OR knee joint arthritis OR degenerative joint disease OR osteoarthrosis of the knee OR knee cartilage degeneration OR Osteoarthritis [MeSH] OR Knee [MeSH] OR Arthritis [MeSH] OR Knee Joint [MeSH] OR Osteoarthritis [MeSH]).",
        "The strategy was designed to identify all relevant studies evaluating AD-MSC interventions for knee osteoarthritis up to January 1, 2025, the final search date.",
        "Study Selection",
        "The systematic search across PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, and WHO ICTRP (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) identified 994 records. After removing 477 duplicates, 517 records remained for title and abstract screening, of which 461 were excluded for irrelevance. This left 56 full-text reports for eligibility assessment; however, 23 were not retrievable, reducing the total to 33 studies for a full review.",
        "Following full-text assessment, 25 studies were excluded, primarily due to the use of non-adipose-derived stem cells, the absence of a control arm, or the combination with another intervention. Ultimately, eight RCTs [10-17] met the inclusion criteria and were included in the traditional pairwise and network meta-analyses (Figure 2).",
        "PRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses",
        "Data Extraction",
        "Data extraction was performed using a Microsoft Excel worksheet (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) to ensure consistency and accuracy. Two independent reviewers (Alousious Kasagga and Anushka Verma) gathered data using a predefined form, with any disagreements addressed through discussion or consulting a third reviewer (Eiman Saraya).",
        "Extracted data included study characteristics (authors, year, country, study design), participant demographics (sample size, age, sex, baseline OA severity), and intervention details (MSC dose, frequency, preparation). Comparator treatments (e.g., saline, hyaluronic acid, corticosteroids) were also recorded.",
        "The primary outcomes included pain relief (VAS, NPRS) and functional improvement (WOMAC), while the secondary outcomes assessed treatment durability, adverse events, and the need for surgical intervention. Follow-up durations and effect estimates (mean differences, risk ratios, 95% confidence intervals) were extracted where available.",
        "Outcome Measurement and Scale Standardization",
        "Pain and function outcomes were assessed using either the VAS or the WOMAC, depending on the reporting format of each included study. For VAS, scores reported on a 0-10 Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) were converted to a 0-100 scale by multiplying by 10. In cases where the VAS scale was not explicitly specified, assumptions were made based on standard clinical conventions or baseline mean values. For WOMAC, raw scores with a maximum of 96 (sum of pain, stiffness, and function subscales) were converted to a 0-100 scale where applicable to allow for cross-study comparability. If studies reported only subscales, a composite score was derived using standard weighting. All transformations were performed prior to pooling data to minimize measurement-related variability.",
        "Study Characteristics",
        "Eight RCTs were included, evaluating allogeneic and autologous AD-MSCs at varying doses compared to hyaluronic acid, saline, or standard care [10-17].

        "Table 2 details study methodologies, including randomization, blinding, ethical approval, tissue harvest locations, treatment processes, and funding sources. Most trials utilized double-blinding and were industry-funded, with AD-MSCs primarily harvested from abdominal tissue.",
        "Network Structure",
        "The network meta-analysis included eight RCTs with 11 pairwise comparisons across four treatment groups: high-dose autologous AD-MSCs, high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs, low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs, and the control group. Some trials featured multiple treatment arms, forming a well-connected network. This network structure forms a cohesive subnetwork, ensuring that indirect comparisons can be made where direct head-to-head trials are unavailable. For instance, since both high-dose autologous and high-dose allogeneic were compared to the control group but not to each other, their relative efficacy can still be estimated through indirect comparison using the standard control group as a reference. By incorporating these comparisons, the analysis provided a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy and safety of AD-MSC therapies for knee osteoarthritis.",
        "Risk of Bias Assessment",
        "The quality of the included studies was judged using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 (ROB2) tool, incorporating a weighted approach based on each study’s contribution [18]. Two independent reviewers evaluated five domains: randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selection of reported results. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer.",
        "Each domain was classified as low risk, with some concerns, or high risk of bias, with overall study ratings determined based on weighted contributions providing a transparent assessment of study quality [19]. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of studies with a higher risk of bias on meta-analysis findings.",
        "Statistical Analysis",
        "A traditional pairwise meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model was performed in RevMan 5.4.1 (Review Manager {RevMan}, 2020), with results presented as forest plots for direct treatment comparisons. A frequentist NMA was also performed to estimate overall treatment effects, visualized in a summary frequentist NMA forest plot.",
        "Treatment rankings were determined using a Bayesian NMA framework, generating SUCRA probabilities to evaluate the relative efficacy of interventions [20]. Consistency testing included a frequentist loop inconsistency test and a Bayesian node-splitting analysis to assess direct and indirect evidence agreement. All NMA analyses were performed in MetaInsight (National Institute for Health and Care Research {NIHR} Complex Reviews Support Unit, University of Leicester, UK), following PRISMA-NMA guidelines [21].",
        "Results",
        "Introduction to Results",
        "This section presents findings from the traditional pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis, assessing the effectiveness of different interventions for pain relief and functional improvement, as measured by the VAS and the WOMAC. Analyses were performed at three time points (three, six, and 12 months) to evaluate both short-term and long-term treatment efficacy. Additionally, adverse effects were examined across all time points to assess the safety profile of each intervention.",
        "Traditional meta-analysis (direct comparisons): A traditional pairwise meta-analysis was conducted to summarize direct treatment comparisons from the available studies. The results are presented as forest plots, showing the pooled effect sizes of VAS and WOMAC scores at each time point. Funnel plots were also created to assess publication bias in the direct comparisons.",
        "Frequentist network meta-analysis (indirect and direct comparisons): To provide a comprehensive ranking of treatments, a frequentist NMA was conducted, integrating both direct and indirect evidence. The results are presented using a summary frequentist NMA forest plot, comparing all interventions based on VAS and WOMAC scores at each time point.",
        "Treatment rankings were determined using SUCRA probabilities, derived from a Bayesian framework, which indicates the likelihood of each intervention being the most effective. These rankings are represented through radial plots and Litmus Rank-O-Gram plots, allowing for a clear interpretation of treatment efficacy over time.",
        "Adverse effects analysis: To assess treatment safety, adverse effects were analyzed across all time points. Both traditional meta-analysis and NMA were used to compare adverse effects, with results presented as forest plots displaying risk estimates. Treatments were ranked based on safety profiles using SUCRA values, identifying interventions with the lowest risk of adverse effects.",
        "Validity and quality assessment: To evaluate the reliability of the findings, two additional analyses were conducted. First, a ROB2 assessment was performed to assess study quality and potential bias. The results of the ROB2 evaluation indicate the proportion of studies categorized as having low, some, or high risk of bias, providing insight into the overall credibility of the evidence.",
        "Second, consistency testing was conducted to verify whether direct and indirect evidence agreed within the NMA. A frequentist approach was used to assess global consistency through loop inconsistency tests, while a Bayesian node-splitting analysis was applied to detect potential inconsistencies in specific treatment comparisons.",
        "Summary of treatment rankings: To identify the best-performing treatments, SUCRA values were calculated for VAS and WOMAC scores at all time points. A SUCRA bar graph provides an overview of which treatments are most effective across three, six, and 12 months. These rankings allow for a direct comparison of interventions, facilitating evidence-based decision-making regarding optimal pain management strategies.",
        "Risk of bias assessment (ROB2 results): Eight RCTs were assessed using the ROB2 tool, which incorporates a weighted ROB2 approach to account for each study’s contribution to the meta-analysis. As shown in Figure 3A, six studies [12-17] demonstrated a low risk of bias across all domains, while two studies [10,11] showed some concerns in D2 (deviations from intended intervention) and D4 (outcome measurement bias). Figure 3B presents the weighted risk of bias distribution, illustrating that most studies had a low risk of bias. Some concerns were noted in 25% of studies for D2 and D4, but their impact was minimal.",

        "VAS Score Change (Three Months)",
        "Traditional meta-analysis: A traditional pairwise meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model evaluated the change in VAS scores at three months across three treatment groups: low-dose allogeneic, high-dose allogeneic, and high-dose autologous AD-MSCs. A total of 270 participants were analyzed across eight studies.",
        "High-dose autologous AD-MSCs demonstrated the greatest improvement in VAS scores (MD = -13.38; 95% CI: -18.29, -8.47), followed by high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs (MD = -12.52; 95% CI: -19.11, -5.93). Low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs showed the smallest effect (MD = -8.79; 95% CI: -15.91, -1.68). Heterogeneity was low for low-dose allogeneic (I² = 12%) but higher for high-dose allogeneic (I² = 68%) and high-dose autologous (I² = 72%), indicating some variability in treatment effects, as shown in Figure 4A. The funnel plot, Figure 4B, suggests no strong evidence of publication bias, as most studies are symmetrically distributed. However, a slight asymmetry is observed for high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs, suggesting potential small-study effects.",

The estimated mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for both direct and indirect comparisons are summarized below.",
        "Low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs showed the greatest improvement in VAS scores in Chen et al. (2021) (MD = -16.27; 95% CI: -28.42, -4.12), while Freitag et al. (2024) and Kuah et al. (2018) reported smaller effects with wide confidence intervals, indicating uncertainty in their estimates [10,12,14]. High-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs had the most substantial pain reduction in Chen et al. (2021) (MD = -25.61; 95% CI: -40.81, -10.41), whereas Freitag et al. (2024) and Sadri et al. (2023) showed more variable responses, with some confidence intervals crossing zero [10,12,17]. When comparing high-dose allogeneic to low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs, the effect size was less pronounced (MD = -9.34; 95% CI: -23.81, 5.13), suggesting comparable efficacy between the two treatments. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs, particularly in Freitag et al. (2019), exhibited the strongest VAS reduction (MD = -26.00; 95% CI: -37.67, -14.33), with similar but slightly less pronounced effects observed in Kim et al. (2023) and Lee et al.

        "Sensitivity Analyses",
        "Sensitivity analyses (leave-one-out method) were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the meta-analysis findings. For VAS outcomes at three months, sequentially omitting each study resulted in pooled MD values ranging from -12.1 mm (all studies included) to -10.7 mm upon exclusion of Kim et al. (2023), with heterogeneity (I²) reducing from 52% to 35% [13]. At six months, the largest observed shift was 1.2 mm (from -11.3 mm to -10.1 mm), occurring after excluding Freitag et al. (2024); heterogeneity remained largely unaffected (79% vs. 80%) [12]. At 12 months, removing Sadri et al. (2023) produced the largest change, shifting MD from -22.0 mm to -18.2 mm and substantially reducing I² from 63% to 17% [17].",
        "For WOMAC scores, omitting Kim et al. (2023) at three months resulted in an MD shift of 1.5 points (-9.3 to -7.8 on a 0-100 scale), with a corresponding decrease in I² by 37 percentage points [13]. At six months, excluding Lu et al. (2019), it caused a similar effect-size shift of 1.4 points (-12.9 to -11.4), accompanied by a 36-percentage-point reduction in I² [16]. At 12 months, again excluding Lu et al. (2019) led to the largest MD shift (-19.2 to -14.7 points) while excluding Sadri et al. (2023) decreased I² by 13% [16,17].",
        "Importantly, across all time points and outcomes, the omission of any single study did not reverse statistical significance or substantially alter clinical interpretation. Thus, these analyses support the robustness of our pooled estimates.",
        "Consistency Testing Results",
        "To ensure the reliability of the NMA results, we assessed the consistency between direct and indirect estimates using loop inconsistency testing within a frequentist framework and node-splitting analysis within a Bayesian framework [22]. These methods examined whether there were any discrepancies between direct and indirect comparisons in the treatment network for both the VAS and WOMAC scores at 12 months.",
        "Loop inconsistency analysis: The loop inconsistency test compared direct and indirect treatment effects to identify significant deviations in network coherence.",
        "No statistically significant inconsistency was observed for VAS scores at 12 months, as indicated by p-values > 0.05 across all comparisons. The highest difference between direct and indirect estimates was observed in the Low-Dose Allogeneic AD-MSCs vs. Control comparison (difference: 41.10, 95% CI: -11.81 to 94.02), though it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1279). Similarly, comparisons between High-Dose Allogeneic AD-MSCs and Control and High-Dose Autologous AD-MSCs and Control demonstrated no evidence of substantial inconsistency (p = 0.7189 and p = 0.1500, respectively).",
        "For WOMAC scores at 12 months, the loop inconsistency results similarly demonstrated no significant discordance between direct and indirect estimates. The most considerable difference was observed in the High-Dose Allogeneic AD-MSCs vs. Low-Dose Allogeneic AD-MSCs comparison (difference: 39.42, 95% CI: -4.54 to 83.38), but this variation was not statistically significant (p = 0.0788).",
        "Node-splitting analysis: The Bayesian node splitting analysis showed no statistically significant inconsistencies between direct and indirect comparisons. For VAS scores at 12 months, the High-Dose Allogeneic AD-MSCs vs. Low-Dose Allogeneic AD-MSCs comparison had a p-value of 0.2773. At the same time point, the WOMAC scores of the High-Dose Allogeneic AD-MSCs vs. Low-Dose Allogeneic AD-MSCs comparison yielded a p-value of 0.1981, further supporting consistency within the network.",
        "Discussion",
        "Efficacy Overview and Treatment Patterns",
        "Summary of key findings: This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy and safety of AD-MSC therapies for knee OA, utilizing both traditional pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis across three, six, and 12-month time points. The findings highlight distinct patterns in pain reduction (VAS scores), functional improvement (WOMAC scores), and adverse effects, allowing for a comparative assessment of treatment options.",
        "Effectiveness of MSC therapies over time: At three months, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs ranked highest for pain relief (VAS SUCRA: 75.99%), followed closely by high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs (SUCRA: 71.39%), while low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs ranked significantly lower (SUCRA: 50.53%). A similar trend was observed for functional improvement, where high-dose autologous AD-MSCs (WOMAC SUCRA: 79.75%) and high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs (SUCRA: 67.72%) outperformed low-dose AD-MSCs therapy (SUCRA: 48.06%).",
        "At six months, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs remained the most effective for pain reduction (VAS SUCRA: 82.27%), but the gap between autologous and allogeneic high-dose AD-MSCs narrowed. Notably, functional improvement rankings shifted, with high-dose allogeneic MSCs surpassing autologous AD-MSCs for WOMAC improvement (SUCRA: 74.59% vs. 67.62%).",
        "At 12 months, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs continued to provide the highest pain relief (VAS SUCRA: 81.65%), while high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs ranked highest for functional improvement (WOMAC SUCRA: 71.71%). Across all time points, the control group consistently ranked lowest, confirming its limited efficacy in managing OA symptoms compared to AD-MSC-based therapies.",
        "VAS vs. WOMAC trends (alignment and divergence): The treatment rankings for pain relief (VAS) and functional improvement (WOMAC) showed both alignment and divergence over time. At three months, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs ranked highest for both outcomes, indicating a strong early effect on both symptom relief and joint function. However, as time progressed, the rankings began to diverge. At six months, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs remained the most effective for pain reduction (VAS SUCRA: 82.27%), while high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs emerged as the top-ranked treatment for functional improvement (WOMAC SUCRA: 74.59%). This divergence persisted at 12 months, with high-dose autologous AD-MSCs maintaining their leading position for pain relief (VAS SUCRA: 81.65%) and high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs continuing to rank highest for functional recovery (WOMAC SUCRA: 71.71%).",
        "These trends suggest that distinct biological mechanisms may underlie short-term pain relief versus longer-term improvements in joint function. Autologous AD-MSCs may exert their early analgesic effects through rapid immune modulation, high cytokine secretion, and prompt suppression of inflammation. In contrast, allogeneic AD-MSCs may provide delayed but durable benefits by promoting sustained tissue remodeling and gradual joint structure and function improvements.",
        "Short-term vs. long-term efficacy: The findings support a two-phase model of AD-MSC therapy. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs consistently delivered the greatest pain relief (VAS) across all time points three, six, and 12 months, suggesting strong and sustained anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs demonstrated superior outcomes in functional improvement (WOMAC) at both six and 12 months, indicating a delayed but durable impact on joint recovery. This highlights the differential therapeutic mechanisms of autologous and allogeneic AD-MSCs, where autologous AD-MSCs primarily drive sustained inflammation suppression and symptom relief, whereas allogeneic AD-MSCs enhance long-term joint recovery through prolonged immune modulation and cartilage repair [5,23,24].",
        "Dose-dependent responses (high vs. low-dose AD-MSCs): A clear dose-dependent response was observed, with high-dose AD-MSCs consistently improving pain relief and functional outcomes across all time points. This pattern supports the hypothesis that higher concentrations of AD-MSCs enhance therapeutic efficacy, a finding also supported by previous network meta-analyses [25].",
        "While low-dose AD-MSCs conferred some clinical benefit, their effects were modest compared to high-dose treatments. These results suggest that optimizing AD-MSC dosage plays a critical role in maximizing therapeutic outcomes, particularly in patients with more advanced or symptomatic osteoarthritis.",
        "Biological Insights and Ranking Validity",
        "Biological mechanisms underlying source-dependent effects: The differing efficacy patterns of autologous and allogeneic AD-MSCs over time may be attributed to variations in cell survival, immunogenicity, and mechanisms of action. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs consistently provided the greatest pain relief at three, six, and 12 months, likely due to rapid cell integration, potent early paracrine signaling, and strong anti-inflammatory cytokine release, particularly IL-10 and TGF-β [2, 3]. Autologous stem cells are patient-derived, so they are less likely to be cleared by the immune system, allowing for more robust early paracrine signaling and rapid symptom relief.",
        "In contrast, while allogeneic AD-MSCs are not self-derived, they exhibit immune-privileged properties and can modulate host immunity. These effects, including inhibition of T-cell proliferation and promoting M2 macrophage polarization, may create a sustained anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative joint environment [26,27]. This immune reshaping may mitigate rejection and enable longer-term persistence and integration, supporting cartilage repair and improved function over time [5].",
        "Overall, the observed clinical trends may be explained by the interplay of three primary mechanisms of AD-MSC therapy: (1) paracrine signaling, which mediates early symptom relief through anti-inflammatory cytokines; (2) immune modulation, which alters chronic inflammatory pathways and fosters immune tolerance; and (3) tissue regeneration, which enables longer-term structural repair of joint tissues. These effects evolve dynamically over time and are influenced by AD-MSC source, dose, and biological behavior. This may help explain why autologous cells yield rapid pain relief, whereas allogeneic cells contribute more to long-term functional restoration.",
        "Network consistency and validity of findings: To ensure the reliability of the NMA results, consistency testing was performed using both frequentist loop inconsistency tests and Bayesian node-splitting analysis at 12 months. Neither method identified statistically significant inconsistencies between direct and indirect treatment comparisons, indicating that the assumptions of the network meta-analysis remained valid.",
        "Interpretation of treatment rankings and temporal efficacy trends: The rankings of AD-MSC therapies for pain relief (VAS) and functional improvement (WOMAC) demonstrated notable shifts across time points, reflecting differences in mechanisms of action, dose-dependent responses, and treatment durability. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs provided sustained analgesic effects over time, ranking highest for pain relief at three, six, and 12 months. Notably, high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs ranked highest for functional improvement at six and 12 months, suggesting a more gradual and sustained regenerative effect on joint function.",
        "Implications of consistency testing on AD-MSC treatment rankings: The consistency testing results confirmed that the NMA upheld its assumptions, with no statistically significant inconsistencies between direct and indirect estimates [22]. Both loop inconsistency testing and Bayesian node-splitting analysis indicated strong agreement across most treatment comparisons, reinforcing confidence in the validity of SUCRA-based treatment rankings.",
        "Despite the network's overall robustness, some comparisons, particularly those involving low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs, exhibited wider confidence intervals due to limited direct evidence. This suggests that while the general treatment hierarchy remains reliable, rankings for treatments with fewer direct pairwise comparisons should be interpreted with greater caution. Additionally, the absence of long-term follow-up beyond 12 months limits the ability to assess sustained efficacy [28].",
        "Given these findings, the NMA results provide a strong evidence base for guiding treatment selection, but future studies with longer follow-up and additional direct comparisons will be necessary to refine treatment rankings further.",
        "Safety Considerations",
        "Adverse effects and safety profile: The safety analysis highlighted the important trade-offs between efficacy and adverse effects. Among AD-MSC treatments, low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs had the highest risk of adverse effects (SUCRA: 22.24%), followed by high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs (SUCRA: 26.52%). High-dose autologous AD-MSCs, while ranking lower in safety than the control group, remained the safest among AD-MSC therapies (SUCRA: 54.08%). The control group was found to be the safest option (SUCRA: 97.16%).",
        "Serious adverse events (is AD-MSCs therapy risky?): Across the included studies, serious adverse events (SAEs) were rare and occurred at similar or higher rates in control groups compared to AD-MSC treatment groups. No SAE was directly attributed to AD-MSC therapy. For example, one SAE (1.92%) in a control group involved a joint infection requiring study withdrawal [16], while another study [13] reported a pneumonia case in a high-dose autologous AD-MSCs patient and three unrelated SAEs in the control group. Similarly, a third study [10] observed one unrelated SAE in the low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs group. These findings reinforce the safety of AD-MSC therapy for clinical use in osteoarthritis.",
        "Clinical relevance (are the AEs worth the benefit?): While high-dose AD-MSCs were occasionally associated with transient joint pain or swelling at the injection site, these effects were mild and resolved without intervention. To provide additional clinical context, the most frequently reported adverse events across the included studies included arthralgia, joint swelling, injection site discomfort, and stiffness. In Kim et al. (2023), 48 patients (38.4%) experienced at least one adverse event, with 50 Grade 1 and 22 Grade 2 events and no Grade ≥3 events [13]. Kuah et al. (2018) reported that over 80% of events were mild, with a single severe event (prepatellar bursitis) potentially related to the injection [14]. Lee et al. (2019) documented 22 Grade 1, 9 Grade 2, and 3 Grade 3 events, all resolved without further treatment [15]. Chen et al. (2021) noted treatment-related joint pain (15.8%), arthralgia (14%), and joint swelling (10.5%), with only one Grade ≥3 AE considered related to treatment [10]. These data collectively reinforce the favorable safety profile of AD-MSC therapy, particularly for high-dose autologous preparations.\nNotably, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs offered the strongest efficacy and ranked safest among all treatment options. In contrast, low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs had the highest rate of adverse events and provided less clinical benefit, raising questions about their clinical value.",
        "Selecting the appropriate AD-MSC dose and source should be based on individual patient factors such as osteoarthritis severity, symptom burden, and tolerance for mild adverse effects. For patients prioritizing symptom relief and functional recovery, particularly those with moderate to severe disease, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs may offer the most favorable balance of safety and efficacy.",
        "Trade-off between efficacy and safety of AD-MSC therapy: The balance between efficacy and safety is a critical factor in clinical decision-making for AD-MSC therapy in knee osteoarthritis. High-dose AD-MSCs demonstrated the greatest improvements in both pain relief (VAS) and functional outcomes (WOMAC), particularly when autologous AD-MSCs were used. Importantly, adverse event risk did not increase uniformly with dose. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs exhibited the most favorable safety profile, while low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs had the highest incidence of mild-to-moderate adverse events. These findings challenge the assumption that lower doses are inherently safer and highlight the importance of considering both cell source and dose when evaluating AD-MSC therapies.",
        "Clinical Translation and Future Directions",
        "Limitations and clinical implications: Several limitations must be acknowledged. Most included studies received partial or complete industry sponsorship, which may introduce publication or performance bias. Additionally, relatively few direct head-to-head comparisons exist between dose levels or MSC sources, requiring reliance on indirect evidence within the NMA framework. These limitations restrict generalizability and underscore the need for standardized outcome definitions, longer follow-up, and non-industry-funded trials.",
        "A further notable notable source of heterogeneity in this meta-analysis is differences in outcome measurement tools and scale reporting. While all included studies assessed pain and function, the specific implementation of these measures varied. Some studies utilized a 0-100 mm VAS, while others used a 0-10 Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), introducing potential scale-related inconsistencies. Similarly, WOMAC scores were reported either as raw totals (maximum 96), normalized percentages (0-100), or as subscales without a unified format. Although we applied standardized conversions to harmonize these scales, such differences in measurement and reporting may have contributed to the observed between-study heterogeneity. However, our sensitivity analysis demonstrated that our findings were not dependent on any single study; despite moderate shifts in effect size and heterogeneity when removing influential studies, the findings' overall significance and direction remained robust. This enhances confidence in the reliability of our pooled estimates. These inconsistencies highlight the importance of future research adopting unified reporting standards to facilitate more accurate comparisons.",
        "From a clinical perspective, treatment selection may based on practical and biological factors. Autologous AD-MSCs may be ideal for younger patients with early to moderate OA (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II-III), given the higher regenerative capacity of autologous cells and their safety profile. However, autologous therapy involves liposuction, cell processing, and delayed treatment, which may be costly and logistically intensive. Allogeneic AD-MSCs, by contrast, offer off-the-shelf availability, making them more feasible for older patients, patients with comorbidities, or those seeking faster access to therapy. Depending on patient characteristics and resource availability, clinicians may consider a phased strategy, using autologous MSCs for early intervention and allogeneic products for sustained joint support.",
        "Implications for clinical decision-making: The absence of treatment-related serious adverse events strengthens AD-MSC therapy's overall safety profile, supporting its clinical viability. Clinicians should inform patients about the possibility of mild, self-limiting side effects while reassuring them that serious complications are rare [24,29].",
        "These findings suggest that high-dose AD-MSC therapy, particularly autologous AD-MSCs, may offer a favorable balance of safety and efficacy for many patients. However, the choice between autologous and allogeneic sources should be individualized based on patient goals, tolerability, and whether rapid symptom relief or long-term functional improvement is prioritized.",
        "Therapeutic role of AD-MSCs in knee OA: The findings of this network meta-analysis provide valuable insights into the clinical application of AD-MSC therapy for knee osteoarthritis. High-dose AD-MSCs, particularly autologous AD-MSCs, demonstrated superior efficacy in pain relief (VAS), while high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs showed greater improvements in long-term joint function (WOMAC). These findings suggest that AD-MSC therapy may offer a more effective alternative to conventional intra-articular treatments such as corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid, especially for patients who have not responded to traditional pharmacologic or injection-based therapies [27,30].",
        "While surgical intervention such as total knee replacement (TKR) remains the definitive option for advanced knee OA, AD-MSC therapy presents a promising regenerative approach for patients aiming to delay or avoid surgery [1]. One study [31] even reported that patients treated with MSCs in one knee and TKA in the other experienced better functional outcomes and fewer complications in the MSC-treated knee. Although these findings are preliminary, they underscore MSC therapy’s potential role as an intermediate option between conservative care and surgery.",
        "Given its favorable safety and efficacy profile, AD-MSC therapy may serve as a valuable treatment strategy for patients with moderate to severe OA who are not yet candidates for surgery. Individualized treatment decisions should consider patient preferences, disease severity, and the desire to delay surgical intervention.",
        "Should clinicians prefer autologous or allogeneic MSCs?: The choice between autologous and allogeneic AD-MSCs should be guided by treatment goals and clinical context. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs demonstrated stronger and more consistent pain relief across all time points, making them a compelling option for patients seeking rapid symptom control. In contrast, high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs ranked higher for functional improvement at six and 12 months, suggesting greater long-term regenerative effects. Practical considerations also influence clinical decision-making. Autologous AD-MSCs require harvesting and processing from the patient, which may increase procedural burden, cost, and treatment delay. Meanwhile, allogeneic AD-MSCs offer off-the-shelf convenience, enabling easier access and potentially broader scalability [7].",
        "Future research priorities: While this study provides strong support for the clinical use of AD-MSC therapy in knee osteoarthritis, several key research gaps remain. One major limitation is the short follow-up duration in most studies. Although this network meta-analysis assessed outcomes up to 12 months, the long-term durability of AD-MSC therapy remains uncertain. Future trials should extend follow-up beyond 24 months to determine whether improvements in pain and function are sustained or decline over time [28]. Long-term safety monitoring will also be critical to assess any delayed adverse effects, including immune responses or intra-articular complications such as fibrosis.",
        "Another important priority is the need for direct, head-to-head randomized controlled trials comparing autologous and allogeneic AD-MSC. While this NMA provided indirect comparisons, direct evidence is needed to clarify differences in clinical efficacy, immune compatibility, and persistence within the joint environment [25,31].",
        "Additionally, future studies should explore biomarker-based patient selection strategies to optimize AD-MSC therapy. Given the heterogeneity of OA progression and treatment response, identifying biological predictors of success could improve outcomes and reduce unnecessary exposure for non-responders. Biomarkers such as IL-6, TNF-α, synovial fluid composition, or cartilage degradation products may help identify patients most likely to benefit from AD-MSC therapy [32,33]. This personalized approach could enhance treatment precision and maximize the clinical value of AD-MSC in OA management.",
        "This network meta-analysis demonstrates that high-dose AD-MSC therapy offers superior pain relief and functional improvement compared to conventional intra-articular treatments for knee osteoarthritis. A clear dose-dependent response was observed, with higher doses consistently outperforming lower doses in symptom relief and functional outcomes. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs were most effective for rapid and sustained pain reduction, while high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs ranked highest for long-term functional recovery at six and 12 months, suggesting distinct therapeutic profiles. Although mild to moderate adverse effects such as transient joint pain and swelling were more common in high-dose groups, serious adverse events were rare and occurred at similar rates to control groups, supporting the overall safety of AD-MSC therapy.",
        "Clinically, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs may be preferred for patients seeking immediate symptom relief, whereas high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs may better support long-term joint function. Given its favorable safety profile and comparative effectiveness, AD-MSC therapy represents a promising alternative for patients who have not responded to conventional treatments such as corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid.
