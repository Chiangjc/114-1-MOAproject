        "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a severe cardiac disease characterized by acute occlusion of the coronary arteries, leading to ischemic necrosis of cardiomyocytes. According to the 2023 report from the World Heart Federation, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are one of the leading causes of death globally [1]. In China, the mortality rate of coronary heart disease among urban residents was 126.91 per 100,000 in 2020, while in rural residents it was 135.88 per 100,000. Notably, the mortality rate of MI increased from 2002 to 2020, with the mortality rate of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among urban residents reaching as high as 78.65% in 2020, and 60.29% among rural residents [2]. After MI, the heart undergoes a series of complex biological processes that ultimately lead to pathological changes in cardiac structure and function. Specifically, these changes include ventricular dilation, myocardial hypertrophy, and contractile dysfunction, collectively termed ventricular remodeling (VR). VR is an adaptive response of the heart to injury following MI, but it often culminates in the development of heart failure.",
        "VR is a complex, multi-stage, and dynamic process involving the interaction of various cell types and molecular mechanisms. Its core components include cardiomyocyte death, activation of the inflammatory response, recruitment and proliferation of myofibroblasts, remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and adaptive changes in the vascular network. In terms of temporal sequence, VR can be roughly divided into three stages: the inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase, and the maturation phase. From the perspective of remodeling scope, it can be further categorized into early and late remodeling. At the onset of VR, cardiomyocyte death due to ischemic injury acts as the trigger for the entire remodeling process. The damaged myocardial tissue, particularly the dead cardiomyocytes, releases a series of alarmins known as “danger-associated molecular patterns” (DAMPs), such as high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1). In addition, the injured tissue releases various chemokines, cytokines, heat shock proteins (HSPs), and components of the complement system, which together constitute the initiating signals for the inflammatory response. Stimulated by these signals, the inflammatory response is rapidly activated, involving the activation of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Neutrophils and macrophages are recruited and infiltrate the myocardial injury area, performing their phagocytic and clearance functions to remove dead cells and ECM debris from the infarcted region. This process not only clears the “debris” from the injured area but also creates conditions for the subsequent migration, proliferation, and activation of immune cells and fibroblasts. Based on the inflammatory response, further remodeling of cardiac tissue ensues. The interaction between cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and ECM becomes the core of remodeling, while changes in endothelial cell function also play a crucial role. Under the influence of various cytokines and growth factors, fibroblasts are transformed into myofibroblasts, which actively participate in ECM deposition and remodeling. Meanwhile, endothelial cells contribute to the remodeling of cardiac tissue by forming new blood vessels and repairing processes, providing necessary blood supply to the remodeling heart. These consecutive events not only reshape the structure of the heart but also profoundly affect its function. The ultimate outcome of VR, whether in terms of structural changes or functional impacts, is decisive for the clinical prognosis of patients.",
        "Regeneration refers to the process of restoring the structure and function of damaged tissue through cell proliferation and differentiation. After MI, regeneration mainly involves cardiomyocyte regeneration and angiogenesis. Cardiomyocyte regeneration refers to the differentiation of stem cells into new cardiomyocytes to replace those that died due to infarction. Angiogenesis refers to the formation of new blood vessels in the damaged tissue to restore blood flow. Repair refers to filling the voids in damaged tissue and restoring tissue integrity through ECM remodeling and fibrosis. After MI, the repair process mainly involves the formation of scar tissue to prevent cardiac rupture. Cardiac regeneration and repair after MI involve multiple mechanisms, including activation of the inflammatory response, activation of fibroblasts, collagen deposition, recruitment and differentiation of stem cells, and ECM remodeling. These mechanisms interact with each other to promote the repair and functional recovery of the damaged myocardium.",
        "For patients post-MI, regeneration and repair of the infarcted myocardium have significant clinical implications. Compared with traditional pharmacological treatments and surgical interventions, regenerative medicine approaches such as stem cell therapy have significant potential benefits. Stem cell therapy can comprehensively improve cardiac structure and function by promoting cardiomyocyte regeneration, angiogenesis, reducing fibrosis, and modulating immune responses. However, despite the great potential of stem cell therapy in the treatment of MI, it still faces many challenges. For example, low cell survival rates and excessive fibrosis limit the effectiveness of its clinical application. Therefore, in-depth research into the mechanisms of stem cell therapy, optimization of treatment strategies, and validation of its efficacy and safety in clinical settings are of great significance for advancing the treatment of post-MI myocardial remodeling.",
        "This review aims to explore in depth the key roles and mechanisms of cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, ECM, endothelial cells, and immune cells in the process of VR after MI. Additionally, this study focuses on analyzing the potential impact of stem cell therapy on ischemic myocardial repair and proposes new directions and prospects for myocardial repair after MI.",
        "During MI, necrosis of cardiomyocytes is the primary manifestation. This process is complex and severe, extending not only to the infarcted area but also to the adjacent border zone and potentially even to distant cardiomyocytes. Pathological insults such as tissue ischemia and hypoxia lead to a progressive loss of cardiomyocytes, accompanied by the disruption of the interstitial collagen framework (degradation of the ECM, discussed in detail later), ultimately resulting in localized thinning and dilation of the myocardium in the infarcted region [3].",
        "From a biological perspective, cardiomyocytes are generally considered terminally differentiated cells with extremely limited proliferative capacity. Instead, cardiomyocytes primarily respond to various stimuli through changes such as hypertrophy, atrophy, or apoptosis. In the weeks to months following MI, surviving cardiomyocytes undergo a series of changes, the most notable of which is eccentric hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes in the non-infarcted area due to increased myocardial load, leading to dilation of the left ventricular cavity [4]. This process is initially compensatory, aiming to maintain cardiac output following infarcted myocardium and the resultant formation of non-compliant scar tissue. However, over time, these changes result in increased wall stress, left ventricular enlargement, and subsequent increases in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, as well as elevated myocardial oxygen consumption, potentially expanding the area at risk for ischemia [5]. Persistent ventricular dilation also leads to hemodynamic abnormalities, including the development of ischemic or functional mitral regurgitation [6]. With increased left ventricular preload and thinning of the ventricular wall, the heart is unable to generate sufficient contractile force, resulting in further increases in end-systolic volume and a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction. This process is a central mechanism in the development of ischemia-driven dilated cardiomyopathy and a key factor in the progression to heart failure.",
        "Following MI, the mobilization and activation of reparative fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are essential for repairing the infarcted myocardial tissue. These cells synthesize and regulate the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins to prevent catastrophic events such as ventricular rupture. However, increasing evidence suggests that the role of fibroblasts extends beyond modulating fibrotic responses for myocardial repair; their reaction to inflammatory signals and regulation of the inflammatory response also have profound impacts on myocardial repair. A thorough understanding of the phenotypic transitions and functional changes of fibroblasts during myocardial repair after MI is a current priority in post-MI research and holds significant clinical implications for patients with MI or heart failure.",
        "Fibroblasts are considered the “sentinel cells” of myocardial injury. They are widely distributed in the cardiac interstitium, interact with cardiomyocytes, and serve as an important source of pro-inflammatory mediators. However, the precise role of fibroblasts in activating the post-infarction inflammatory cascade remains unclear.",
        "Most evidence regarding the role of fibroblasts in post-infarction inflammation is descriptive. Studies have shown that in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion models, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate inflammasomes in fibroblasts and promote the generation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), thereby triggering leukocyte infiltration and cytokine expression [7]. Additionally, the expression of NLRP3 and IL-18 mRNA in the left ventricle is significantly increased, primarily localized to cardiac fibroblasts, especially when exposed to ATP. In NLRP3-deficient mice, cardiac function is significantly improved, and ischemic injury is reduced following ischemia-reperfusion [8]. This suggests that the NLRP3 inflammasome may be a key mediator through which fibroblasts exert their effects in myocardial tissue after MI.",
        "Notably, the pro-inflammatory environment in the early post-infarction period has a significant impact on the phenotype and function of fibroblasts. For example, ROS can induce cardiac fibroblasts to produce pro-inflammatory signals while reducing ECM synthesis and enhancing the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [9]. Cytokine stimulation may also play an important role during the inflammatory phase of cardiac repair. Studies have shown that in animal models of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion, the oncostatin-M (OSM) receptor on the surface of cardiac fibroblasts can bind to OSM, synthesizing and releasing keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC/CXCL1) and lipopolysaccharide-induced chemokine (LIX/CXCL5) through the JAK-STAT, MAPK, and PI3 K pathways. These factors are potent neutrophil chemoattractants [10]. IL-1α can promote the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-6 from cardiac fibroblasts, while also secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [11]. In addition, IL-1β can inhibit transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, reduce the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and stimulate the synthesis of MMPs in an IL-1R1-dependent manner [12]. Beyond their pro-inflammatory effects, cytokine stimulation can also enhance fibroblast responsiveness to profibrotic signals. For example, following MI, increased levels of TNF-α and angiotensin II (Ang II) can induce the expression of the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) in fibroblasts, thereby increasing cell [3 H]-proline incorporation and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) protein expression stimulated by Ang II, while reducing MMP-2 activity and expression [13].",
        "The attenuation of the inflammatory response marks the transition of the repair process to the proliferative phase. However, whether fibroblasts act as anti-inflammatory cells during this process remains unclear. IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK-3/IRAK-M) is an anti-inflammatory mediator expressed in the infarcted area, which can inhibit the inflammatory response following MI by reducing cellular responsiveness to pro-inflammatory signals, expressing decoy cytokine and chemokine receptors, and releasing soluble anti-inflammatory mediators [14]. In a mouse MI model, IRAK-M is significantly upregulated in fibroblasts and infiltrating macrophages, characterized by inhibition of fibroblast matrix-degrading properties and timely suppression of the inflammatory response. In contrast, IRAK-M knockout mice exhibit enhanced myocardial inflammation and protease activation, leading to adverse cardiac remodeling [15]. Given the dynamic changes in fibroblasts during myocardial repair and their responsiveness to inflammatory mediators, it can be hypothesized that fibroblasts may play an important role in suppressing post-infarction inflammation. However, the mediators and specific regulatory mechanisms involved require further investigation.",
        "During the proliferative phase, fibroblasts emerge as the predominant cell type within the infarcted myocardium. Their key characteristics include high proliferative activity, migratory behavior through the temporary matrix network of the infarct region, transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts, and sustained synthesis of structural and extracellular matrix proteins.",
        "Under the dual influence of ECM degradation and mechanical stress, fibroblasts are stimulated by growth factors and cytokines to undergo phenotypic transformation into myofibroblasts [16]. Studies have shown that the infiltration of myofibroblasts in the infarct border zone is a hallmark of the transition from the infarct healing into the proliferative phase. These cells express contractile proteins, possess an extensive endoplasmic reticulum, and secrete large amounts of matrix proteins [17, 18]. The formation of myofibroblasts requires the synergistic stimulation of multiple factors, including the activation of TGF-β, deposition of ED-A fibronectin and matricellular proteins, and increased mechanical stress [19].",
        "The TGF-β signaling pathway serves as a crucial link between the inflammatory and reparative responses. TGF-β is rapidly activated in the early stages of infarction, but the abundance of pro-inflammatory mediators at this time reduces cellular (especially fibroblast) responsiveness to TGF-β. As pro-inflammatory signals are attenuated, TGF-β robustly promotes myofibroblast transdifferentiation, activates matrix deposition, induces the expression of collagen and fibronectin, and upregulates the synthesis of protease inhibitors (e.g., TIMP-1) [20]. Studies have indicated that the profibrotic and matrix-depositing actions of TGF-β in fibroblasts are primarily mediated through the activation of the Smad3 signaling pathway, which also interacts with other key pathways regulating fibrogenic responses in the remodeling myocardium. Fibroblasts from Smad3 knockout mice exhibit reduced α-SMA expression, decreased migratory activity, and diminished capacity for extracellular matrix protein synthesis. The TGF-β/Smad3/connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) pathway is a key mediator of these changes [21]. Additionally, TGF-β can mediate the nuclear translocation of myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)-A, thereby inducing α-SMA transcription in fibroblasts. Post-MI, MRTF-A responds to TGF-β1/ROCK signaling, directly binding to and activating the CArG elements on the Col1a2 promoter to promote fibroblast phenotypic transformation and the expression of collagen proteins such as Col1a1 and Col1a2 [22].",
        "The regulation of the matrix environment plays a significant role in myofibroblast transdifferentiation. The extracellular matrix protein fibronectin ED-A is markedly upregulated in post-MI tissue. Studies have shown that ED-A knockout mice exhibit reduced left ventricular dilation and improved myocardial contractile function. At the tissue level, these mice display decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and diminished myofibroblast transdifferentiation [23]. Collagen deposition can also promote fibroblast transdifferentiation in the infarcted myocardium. Studies have shown that cardiac fibroblasts isolated and cultured on collagen matrices exhibit strong induction of myofibroblast transdifferentiation by type VI collagen. Further validation using in vivo MI models revealed concurrent increases in type VI collagen and myofibroblast content in the post-MI myocardium, suggesting an important role for the latter in cardiac remodeling [24]. Proteoglycans expressed by cardiac fibroblasts themselves can also influence myofibroblast transdifferentiation and fibrotic scar formation. Syndecan-4 (Syn4), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, is significantly upregulated in post-MI tissue. Syn4 knockout mice exhibit impaired myofibroblast transdifferentiation, with isolated fibroblasts showing reduced stress fibers and impaired activation of FAK, Akt, and RhoA pathways associated with cell migration and contractile function in response to fibronectin stimulation, as well as an increased incidence of cardiac rupture [25].",
        "Direct evidence for the stimulatory effects of mechanical stress on fibroblasts post-MI is currently lacking, with most studies inferring the role of mechanical stress through descriptions of the unique functional changes in myofibroblasts. Studies have shown that under mechanical stress, fibroblasts acquire contractile stress fibers, thereby gaining the contractile capacity of myofibroblasts [26]. These intracellular microfilament structures, primarily composed of actin and myosin, play a crucial role in cellular contractile function. Moreover, stress fibers connect to the ECM through integrin-containing cell-matrix adhesion sites, remodeling the ECM [27]. In intact tissue, fibroblasts are typically protected by cross-linked ECM; however, disruption of the cardiac ECM’s structural integrity following tissue injury may expose fibroblasts to mechanical stress, thereby promoting their transformation into myofibroblasts. Myocardial hypertrophic growth resulting from pressure or volume overload is another manifestation of mechanical stress stimulation. Studies have shown an association between myocardial hypertrophy and myofibroblast transdifferentiation. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that mechanical stress mediates actin filament assembly through the Rho-Rho kinase-LIMK-cofilin pathway, which promotes the nuclear translocation of transcriptional coactivator MRTF-A and subsequent SMA promoter activation [28].",
        "Numerous studies have confirmed that following MI, fibroblasts exhibit significant proliferative activity within the damaged tissue [29]. The regulation of fibroblast proliferative capacity involves several key molecules, including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), TGF-β1, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), Angiotensin II (Ang II), and β-catenin [30]. Notably, activation of the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway appears to convey an anti-proliferative effect [21].",
        "In animal experiments, the absence of FGF-2 leads to a significant reduction in fibroblast proliferation and interstitial collagen deposition. FGF2 knockout mice exhibit impaired scar contraction, ultimately resulting in increased infarct size and ventricular dilation [31]. Moreover, PDGF secreted by endothelial cells, through activation of the PDGF-B/PDGFR-α pathway, can reduce collagen deposition in the infarcted myocardium, possibly by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation [32]. Studies have shown that Ang II is a crucial regulator of cardiac fibrosis and extracellular matrix protein (e.g., collagen and fibronectin) synthesis in vivo, with one of its mechanisms potentially involving the G-protein-coupled AT1 receptor on cardiac fibroblasts [30]. In a rat MI model, injection of active β-catenin (Ad-catenin) into the infarct border zone significantly reduces infarct size, endowing cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts with anti-apoptotic properties and promoting cell entry into the proliferative cycle while increasing myofibroblast formation. In vitro experiments further confirmed that Ad-catenin primarily acts by increasing the number of fibroblasts [33]. In contrast, the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway is significantly activated in the infarct border zone. In vitro studies have shown that Smad3 knockout fibroblasts exhibit significantly reduced collagen mesh contraction ability, migratory activity in response to serum stimulation, and ECM protein synthesis [21].",
        "Studies have shown that in 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) knockout mice, collagen production and fibroblast accumulation are significantly reduced following MI, likely due to impaired migratory capacity of 5-LOX−/− fibroblasts [34]. During infarct repair, the specific migration of fibroblasts to the infarct area is crucial for the repair process. In addition to 5-LOX, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), and the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway may also promote fibroblast migration [21, 35, 36]. It has been pointed out that quiescent cells typically reside in a “strong adhesion state,” whereas cells involved in post-injury repair and tissue remodeling are in an “intermediate adhesion state,” a process involving cell detachment. Matricellular proteins such as thrombospondin 1 (TSP1), TSP2, tenascin-C, and SPARC possess high regulatory activity and can induce cells to rapidly shift to an intermediate adhesion state, characterized by the loss of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (e.g., vinculin and α-actin). Cell detachment may prevent apoptosis triggered by the loss of intercellular adhesion through the activation of survival signals [37]. IL-1β exerts a concentration-dependent pro-migratory effect on neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts, with all three subfamilies of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)—extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38—being activated in response to cytokine stimulation [35]. CT-1 influences myofibroblast migration through multiple parallel signaling pathways, including altering membrane potential (initial depolarization followed by hyperpolarization), modulating intracellular Ca2+ levels (initial increase followed by decrease), and activating several intracellular signaling pathways, such as JAK2 activation and myosin light chain phosphorylation [36]. Additionally, the activation of migration-inhibitory signals has been observed in MI tissue. For example, the upregulation of CXC chemokine CXCL10/interferon-γ-inducible protein (IP)−10 in the infarcted myocardium inhibits growth factor-induced fibroblast migration [38], which may serve to prevent overly exuberant fibrotic responses.",
        "Numerous studies have demonstrated that myofibroblasts are the primary source of extracellular matrix proteins during MI repair. In addition to this, myofibroblasts regulate matrix homeostasis by promoting the deposition of matricellular proteins and by expressing MMPs and their inhibitors [39]. Several mediators have been identified as being associated with the acquisition of a synthetic phenotype by cardiac fibroblasts. For instance, TGF-β is one of the earliest identified molecules [40], with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 stimulation shown to increase collagen I levels in non-operated control fibroblasts by 187 ± 10% [41]. Activated fibroblasts in the scar region can also secrete components required for the generation of angiotensin peptides, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the levels of which are significantly elevated in fibrous tissue within the infarct area [42]. The use of ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor antagonists has been proven to have positive effects in reducing scar tissue metabolic activity and attenuating myocardial remodeling in non-infarcted regions [43]. However, the composition of the ECM also plays a crucial role in regulating fibroblast function and phenotypic changes, which will be described in the following section.",
        "The maturation phase is characterized by matrix cross-linking and a reduction in cellular components. Studies have shown that in mature infarct tissue, the density of myofibroblasts is significantly decreased, with large areas of myocardial tissue being replaced by collagenous scar in mouse models [44]. Apoptosis has been identified as the primary mechanism for the clearance of fibroblasts in mature scars [45], with matricellular proteins such as thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) potentially playing an important role in regulating fibroblast apoptosis [46]. Additionally, changes in matrix composition and the stable stress environment provided by the mature scar may prompt activated fibroblasts to transition to a quiescent state.",
        "Studies have shown that while a large number of myofibroblasts undergo apoptosis, fibroblasts in the myocardium distant from the infarct region are chronically activated due to the effects of pressure and volume overload. However, research on the characteristics of fibroblasts in the non-infarcted region remains relatively limited. Animal experimental results indicate that pressure overload induces early activation of matrix synthesis pathways, which is associated with myocardial fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction, followed by activation of matrix degradation signals, leading to ventricular dilation and decompensated heart failure [47]. Volume overload, on the other hand, is primarily associated with matrix loss and cardiac dilation [48]. Further exploration is needed to elucidate the phenotypic and functional changes of fibroblasts in this particular and important region.",
        "The cardiac ECM is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the heart. Disruption of the ECM network leads to alterations in ventricular geometry and is closely associated with both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Studies have found that in the context of MI, the composition of the cardiac ECM may undergo the most dramatic changes [49].",
        "In the infarct region, myofibroblasts accumulate in large numbers and produce substantial amounts of extracellular matrix proteins. This collagen-based matrix ultimately forms a mature scar that provides mechanical support to the infarcted heart. In the later stages of healing, defects in ECM components alter the mechanical properties of the heart, leading to enhanced ventricular dilation and spherical changes, known as post-MI remodeling. Additionally, extracellular matrix proteins act as key regulators of the repair response by modulating cell-cell interactions. Extracellular matrix components also play important roles in inflammatory pathways and regulate fibroblast phenotype and gene expression, thus playing a significant role in cardiac repair.",
        "During the inflammatory phase, damaged myocardial tissue releases a series of inflammation-inducing molecules, such as TNF-α and IF-1β, which promote the release and activation of MMPs [50]. Studies have shown that in mouse infarct models, IL-1 stimulates the synthesis of MMPs in an IL-1R1-dependent manner [12]. The rapid activation of MMPs leads to the degradation of the cardiac ECM. In rats subjected to left coronary artery ligation, activation of MMPs is observed in the cardiac interstitium as early as 6 h to 2 days post-infarction [39]. Collagenases cleave collagen into 75 and 25 kDa gelatin fragments, which are further degraded into amino acids and oligopeptides by gelatinases (such as MMP2 and MMP9) and serine proteases [51]. This process involves two aspects: first, in the infarct region, pre-existing latent collagenases (e.g., MMP1) are activated during the repair process, which is an important part of the repair mechanism; second, as the existing collagenases and gelatinases are activated and participate in collagen degradation, their overall levels decrease, triggering the synthesis of new collagenase mRNA to maintain the dynamic balance of collagen degradation during tissue repair [39].",
        "In mouse and canine models of MI, it has been observed that in the early stages of MI, the extravasation of plasma proteins leads to the formation of a complex, fibrillar temporary matrix, primarily composed of fibrin and plasma fibronectin. Subsequently, the temporary matrix derived from plasma proteins is dissolved by proteases produced by granulation tissue cells and is rapidly replaced by a cell-derived temporary matrix, which contains cellular fibronectin and hyaluronan, thus forming the temporary matrix of the inflammatory phase.",
        "Recent studies have found that fibrinogen-derived fragments, as important components of the temporary matrix, make significant pathological contributions to myocardial ischemic injury. In the Langendorff myocardial ischemia-reperfusion model, mice lacking fibrinogen exhibited significantly reduced infarct size. Administration of a fibrin-derived peptide Bβ15–24 to ischemic mice competes with fibrinogen-derived fragment N-terminal disulfide bond-II (similar to fibrin E1 fragment) for binding to vascular endothelial cadherin, thereby preventing leukocyte infiltration into ischemic myocardium and reducing infarct size [52]. In a clinical study involving 234 patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), patients were administered a naturally derived fibrin peptide FX06 or a corresponding placebo via intravenous injection during percutaneous coronary intervention. The results showed that although there was no significant difference in infarct size between the FX06 group and the control group, the area of the necrotic core region on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was significantly reduced [53]. Additionally, studies have indicated that in a skin wound model, animals lacking fibrinogen exhibited reduced tensile strength and delayed wound closure in skin wounds, but the final skin repair was still completed with results comparable to the control group [54]. However, in the MI repair process, reduced scar tensile strength may lead to a series of adverse effects, such as enhanced left ventricular remodeling and significant ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, the important role of fibrinogen in MI repair still requires further exploration.",
        "During the proliferative phase, pro-inflammatory signals are attenuated, while profibrotic signaling is significantly enhanced in the damaged myocardial tissue, accompanied by the generation of new blood vessels. ECM remodeling during this stage is of great significance for tissue repair and regeneration.",
        "During the proliferative phase, fibronectin secreted by fibroblasts and macrophages constitutes a “second-order” provisional matrix. The deposition of fibronectin plays a crucial role in the transdifferentiation and activation of myofibroblasts. The transdifferentiation of myofibroblasts is the result of the combined action of multiple factors, including mechanical tension, TGF-β, and the ED-A splice variant of cellular fibronectin [55, 56]. TGF-β can induce the expression of α-SMA, thereby promoting the transdifferentiation of myofibroblasts. Additionally, TGF-β enhances the synthesis of extracellular matrix molecules, including ED-A fibronectin (FN), which is a fibronectin isoform specifically expressed during wound healing and fibrosis [57, 58]. Studies have shown that application of the anti-ED-A monoclonal antibody IST-9 to rat skin wounds can specifically block the TGF-β-induced upregulation of α-SMA and type I collagen expression, indicating that ED-A FN plays an important role in TGF-β signaling and is essential for TGF-β-induced myofibroblast phenotypic transformation [56]. Fibronectin also plays an important role in the organization and stabilization of the matrix. It dynamically polymerizes to form fibrillar structures within the ECM, thereby maintaining the structure and function of the ECM [59]. For example, in vitro cell experiments have shown that fibronectin polymerization is essential for the deposition of type I collagen and TSP-1, providing a framework for these molecules to be correctly positioned within the ECM. Moreover, fibronectin is important for maintaining the composition of cell-matrix adhesion sites. Studies have found that in the absence of fibronectin, specific integrins (e.g., α5β1) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (e.g., tensin) cannot localize to fibroblast-matrix adhesion sites, which are key areas for cell-ECM interactions [60]. However, the specific significance of these interactions in cardiac repair has not been fully explored. Additionally, the deposition of laminin and hyaluronan in the infarct region is closely related to angiogenesis and cell migration. Specifically, in the early stages of MI, laminin appears fragmented in the infarct region, indicating disruption of the cardiomyocyte basement membrane; however, laminin immunoreactivity is observed in the basement membrane of newly formed blood vessels in the infarct region 7 to 14 days after reperfusion [61]. The formation of new blood vessels provides key oxygen and nutrients for the formation and maturation of the matrix.",
        "Matricellular proteins are a diverse group of extracellular matrix proteins with unique functions. Unlike traditional structural proteins, they do not directly participate in the scaffold construction of the ECM but instead regulate tissue homeostasis and remodeling by modulating cell functions and activities under specific physiological or pathological conditions. Studies have shown that various matricellular proteins are significantly upregulated during the proliferative phase after MI and play key regulatory roles in cardiac repair.",
        "Tenascin-C is a matricellular protein that is significantly upregulated during the proliferative phase. During the proliferative stage following MI, Tenascin-C is primarily secreted by fibroblasts and localized to the edges of the infarct region, remodeled myocardial areas, and around so-called “hibernating myocardial cells” [62]. By 2 to 3 weeks post-infarction, Tenascin-C expression gradually shifts from the edges to the center of the infarct region, and it almost completely disappears during the maturation phase [62]. Studies have shown that various cytokines and growth factors, such as TNF-α, TGF-β, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and Ang II, can stimulate the synthesis of Tenascin-C through paracrine or autocrine pathways [63]. In vitro experiments further revealed the regulatory effects of Tenascin-C on cardiomyocytes. Tenascin-C significantly increases the attachment of cardiomyocytes to laminin but reduces costameric attachment of cardiomyocytes to laminin while increasing non-costameric attachment [64]. Costameres are key structures connecting cardiomyocytes to the surrounding ECM, transmitting the contractile force of myofibrils to the ECM through protein complexes, which is crucial for normal cardiomyocyte function. Costameric attachment is characterized by striated dark contacts in the region where cardiomyocytes contact the culture substrate, helping cardiomyocytes maintain structural integrity during contraction and transmit contractile force to the ECM to maintain cardiac pumping function. However, during tissue remodeling after MI, surviving cardiomyocytes in the infarct border zone need to relax this attachment to rearrange cells. Meanwhile, cells maintain attachment to the matrix through non-costameric white or gray contact sites to cope with the contractile pressure of the myocardial scar later [65]. Therefore, Tenascin-C may promote tissue remodeling by regulating the adhesion of surviving cardiomyocytes in the infarct border zone. Additionally, studies using a mouse model of myocardial cryoinjury combined with in vitro cell models found that Tenascin-C promotes the recruitment of myofibroblasts in myocardial repair by stimulating cell migration and differentiation. The alternatively spliced fibronectin type III (FNIII) and fibrinogen (Fbg)-like domains in Tenascin-C are considered key mediators of this process [66]. However, the specific role of Tenascin-C in post-infarction repair remains unclear.",
        "TSP-1 is another matricellular protein that is significantly upregulated in experimental MI models. In a canine MI reperfusion model, TSP-1 protein was significantly present in the ECM, microvascular endothelial cells, and a subset of monocytes in the infarct border region 5 to 28 days after reperfusion. In TSP-1 knockout (TSP-1−/−) mice with infarction, significant upregulation of chemokines, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, and interferon-γ-inducible protein-10/CXCL10, as well as cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TGF-β, was observed, indicating enhanced post-infarction inflammatory response and prolonged inflammatory phase. Moreover, in TSP-1−/− mice, the density of macrophages and myofibroblasts in the infarcted and adjacent non-infarcted myocardial scar regions was significantly increased, suggesting that granulation tissue formation extended into the non-infarcted region [67]. These results suggest that selective endogenous expression of TSP-1 in the infarct border region may protect non-infarcted myocardium from fibrotic remodeling by inhibiting the inflammatory response and limiting the expansion of granulation tissue. However, the specific anti-inflammatory mechanisms of TSP-1 require further investigation.",
        "Osteopontin (OPN) has been found to be significantly expressed in human post-MI tissue. Studies have shown that OPN mRNA and protein expression is abundant in macrophages within the necrotic and granulation tissues after MI [68]. OPN plays an important role in MI healing and cardiac remodeling. Research has shown that OPN-deficient mice exhibit increased left ventricular dilation, characterized by increased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), while ejection fraction (EF) and percentage fractional shortening (%FS) are significantly reduced. Additionally, activation of MMPs helps reduce myocardial fibrosis and left ventricular dysfunction in OPN-deficient mice [69, 70]. These results indicate that OPN exerts a cardioprotective effect by promoting collagen synthesis and deposition to mitigate adverse myocardial remodeling. However, the specific mechanisms by which OPN mediates matrix remodeling effects remain unclear.",
        "SPARC/Osteonectin is a matricellular protein that regulates cell-matrix interactions during wound healing. Its expression is also significantly upregulated during MI repair. Studies have found that SPARC gene-targeted inactivation in mice results in a fourfold increase in mortality after MI, mainly due to a significant increase in the incidence of cardiac rupture and heart failure. Moreover, the infarct region in SPARC gene knockout mice exhibited disorganized granulation tissue and immature collagen scar. Administration of TGF-β rescued cardiac rupture in mice. In vitro experiments showed that silencing SPARC with shRNA in cardiac fibroblasts significantly weakened TGF-β-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation [71]. These results suggest that SPARC can prevent adverse cardiovascular events after MI and may play a key role through the TGF-β signaling pathway. However, whether SPARC’s cardioprotective effects involve other key mechanisms remains to be explored.",
        "Periostin is a matricellular protein that is highly expressed in the infarct border region of human and mouse myocardium. Researchers constructed a periostin-deficient (periostin−/−) mouse model and found that these mice had impaired cardiac repair after acute MI, leading to cardiac rupture. The results indicated that this was due to reduced recruitment of α-SMA-positive cells, impaired collagen fiber formation, and decreased focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation, thereby reducing myocardial stiffness [72]. Moreover, periostin−/− mice that survived exhibited reduced fibrosis and improved cardiac function. Mechanistic studies found that cardiac fibroblasts isolated from periostin−/− mice had reduced adhesion to cardiomyocytes, and deposition of type V collagen was significantly decreased [73]. Type V collagen plays a key role in regulating collagen fibril diameter and alignment, affecting collagen fiber growth and structure [74]. The above results suggest that periostin may play a role in cardiac repair by inducing myofibroblast recruitment and collagen synthesis.",
        "Studies have shown that in a canine model of MI, collagen content continuously increases from 7 days to 6 weeks post-MI. During the first 7 days following MI, the heart is characterized by ventricular dilation and expansion of the infarct size. However, from day 7 to 6 weeks post-MI, the scar gradually contracts, the infarct area progressively diminishes, and the ventricular wall thins, a phase defined as the maturation period [75]. During scar maturation, the tensile strength of the myocardium significantly increases, a change closely associated with the cross-linking intensity of collagen. It has been found that compared to the control group, the activity of lysyl hydroxylase in infarcted tissue significantly increases and peaks in the later stages of infarction. This heightened enzyme activity promotes the formation of the final mature scar [76]. However, the enhanced tensile strength also passively increases myocardial stiffness, which may subsequently lead to impairments in both diastolic and systolic cardiac function [77]. Additionally, the mature matrix network may shield fibroblasts from mechanical tension, thereby facilitating cell deactivation and entry into a quiescent state [17, 26].",
        "In summary, the components of the ECM are not merely passive byproducts of pathological changes in the infarcted heart but actively regulate inflammatory responses and the repair process by transmitting signals that influence cell survival, phenotypic transformation, and gene expression. The dynamic changes in the ECM not only affect cellular functions but also impact the overall structure and function of the tissue by modulating cell-matrix interactions. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which the ECM functions in MI repair will facilitate the exploration of more effective therapeutic targets and strategies, thereby improving cardiac function and prognosis following MI.",
        "MI inflicts severe damage on the coronary microvasculature, leading to the disintegration of blood vessels in the infarcted area and a paucity of capillaries. This injury manifests primarily in two aspects: On one hand, the death of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells in the core of the infarct leads to intramyocardial hemorrhage, a hallmark of severe microvascular damage; on the other hand, there is a significant increase in microvascular permeability. As myocardial ischemia persists, a robust tissue repair response—angiogenesis—begins to emerge. Studies have shown that an appropriate angiogenic response is closely associated with favorable outcomes in animal models of MI, characterized by reduced scar size, attenuated cardiac remodeling, and improved cardiac function. However, the exact mechanisms remain incompletely understood, with current research mainly focusing on the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the facilitation of material exchange to meet the high metabolic demands, thereby limiting further damage to various cellular components within the microenvironment from ischemic injury [78]. Other studies have also demonstrated that intercellular communication between endothelial cells and other cell types during infarct repair plays an important role in improving cardiac function [79]. What is certain is that the dynamic changes in endothelial cells are of significant importance in the post-MI healing process.",
        "Microvascular injury, along with microvascular occlusion caused by distal arterial thromboembolism and blood cell blockage, is the main manifestation of ischemia/reperfusion injury in the coronary microcirculation. Although endothelial cells can withstand brief ischemic injury, prolonged ischemia or reperfusion following ischemia can lead to irreversible damage. In a rat model, it was found that significant vascular leakage occurred in the infarcted area after 90 min of ischemia, indicating increased vascular permeability [80]. At the microscopic level, capillary endothelial cells exhibited pronounced cytoplasmic blebbing and an increase in the number of caveolae. The increase in caveolar vesicles is considered a key mediator of trans-endothelial transport and also acts as a shear sensor for endothelial cells, leading to endothelial cell proliferation mediated by ROS following a sharp reduction in blood flow [81]. Additionally, the nuclei showed some early signs of apoptosis, such as DNA condensation at the nuclear periphery, which are considered manifestations of endothelial cell activation. The vascular integrity of the microcirculation largely depends on the connections between endothelial cells, and it was found that the average number of connections per capillary in the infarcted area was significantly reduced [80].",
        "Studies have shown that the increase in microvascular permeability is regulated by secretory proteins rapidly produced in the infarcted area under hypoxic conditions. These secretory proteins include: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA), Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), and Angiopoietin 1 and 2 (ANGPT1, ANGPT2). VEGFA is an important member of the VEGF family and plays a dominant role in the regulation of angiogenesis. However, it has been found that VEGFA can also increase microvascular permeability by activating Src tyrosine kinase and disrupting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)/cadherin-5 complex at endothelial cell junctions [82]. In contrast, ANGPTL4 can antagonize the effect of VEGFA on endothelial cell permeability. It has been found that in ANGPTL4 knockout mice and mice treated with recombinant ANGPTL4, ANGPTL4 can stabilize the VEGFR2/cadherin-5 complex, thereby maintaining the structural integrity and barrier function of endothelial cells in the first few hours after reperfusion [83]. Moreover, in patients with AMI, low serum ANGPTL4 concentration after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with microvascular injury and obstruction as shown by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) [84]. ANGPT1 and ANGPT2 play opposing roles in regulating microvascular integrity and inflammation after MI. Endothelial cells produce ANGPT2 under hypoxic and pro-inflammatory cytokine induction, which has been shown to interfere with ANGPT1-tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and epidermal growth factor-like domains 2 (TIE2) signaling after MI, thereby promoting vascular leakage and inflammation [85]. Antibody-mediated neutralization of ANGPT2 has been shown to reduce the final scar size and improve left ventricular remodeling in mice after MI [86].",
        "Enhanced proliferative activity is another important characteristic of endothelial cells after MI. Based on three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction studies of porcine coronary vessels, it was found that the number of microvessels in the infarcted area decreased, and the width and surface area of the vascular network for oxygen and nutrient exchange were reduced, with the capillary network becoming sparse. These changes were more pronounced on day 7 compared to day 1 after MI. However, from the perspective of individual microvessels, the radius and surface area of microvessels significantly increased on day 7 after MI, while vessel length shortened [87]. Further observations of the diameter of residual microvessels after MI revealed that on day 7 post-MI, the percentage of microvessels with a diameter greater than 8.2 μm (i.e., arterioles/venules) and medium-sized capillaries (6.9 and 8.2 μm) in the infarcted area increased, while smaller-diameter vessels decreased. This indicates that microvessels in the infarcted area underwent regression, while others expanded or even underwent arteriolarization. A similar observation was made in the study by Susanne et al. Based on the theory that the formation of medium and large vessels is the result of active endothelial cell proliferation, they observed BrdU-positive flat cells lining the inner walls of blood vessels, demonstrating the proliferative activity of endothelial cells [88].",
        "The above studies demonstrate that within 7 days after MI, the microvascular network in both infarcted and non-infarcted areas exhibits adaptive manifestations of reduced integrity and selective survival. However, existing ischemic and MI animal models still have limitations and may not fully replicate the pathophysiological characteristics of humans. Importantly, findings that endothelial cells exhibit significant apoptosis and impaired intercellular connections have deepened the understanding of the key role of endothelial cells in the MI microenvironment.",
        "With the continuous development of transcriptome sequencing technology, studies have gradually delineated the dynamic changes of endothelial cells after MI through single-cell RNA sequencing. The latest research, through bulk RNA sequencing, analyzed the transcriptomic characteristics of mouse cardiac endothelial cells at three key time points after injury (D0: before injury; D2: day 2 post-MI; D7: day 7 post-MI; D28: day 28 post-MI). The findings revealed that on day 2 post-MI (D2), endothelial cells exhibited increased gene expression related to metabolism, involving enzymes associated with glucose metabolism and nucleotide biosynthesis. Concurrently, genes related to cell proliferation were significantly upregulated, particularly those associated with the transition from the S phase to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, stress and cell death-related genes, such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) and Caspase 3, were upregulated, and endothelial cells acquired a pro-inflammatory phenotype, characterized by significant upregulation in the expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines (e.g., chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 [Ccl2] and Ccl7) and cytokines (e.g., Il6). By day 7 post-MI (D7), during the proliferative phase, the transcriptomic profile of endothelial cells underwent significant changes. At this time, genes associated with cell division were upregulated, indicating that cells entered the mitotic phase (M/G2 phase). Meanwhile, the expression of immune cell binding proteins (e.g., vascular cell adhesion molecule [Vcam1] and intercellular adhesion molecule [Icam1]) and chemokines was increased. In parallel, genes related to vasoconstriction and vascular tone were downregulated, involving calcium signaling pathways and contractile protein-related genes. Moreover, endothelial cells acquired pro-angiogenic and mesenchymal characteristics, as evidenced by the upregulation of ECM synthesis and deposition-related genes (e.g., collagen type I alpha 1 chain [Col1a1] and Postn). On day 28 post-MI (D28), endothelial cells had not yet returned to their pre-infarction state. Functional analysis showed that cells retained pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic, and pro-fibrotic properties [89]. Further research by Lukas et al. revealed that on day 3 post-MI, endothelial cells exhibited increased expression of S phase-related genes, which returned to homeostasis by day 14. Additionally, from day 3 to day 7 post-MI, endothelial cells transiently displayed mesenchymal cell characteristics, with increased expression of genes such as Col3a1, Fn1, and serpin family E member 1 (Serpine1), while the expression of the endothelial cell marker gene claudin-5 (Cldn5) was significantly reduced and returned to baseline levels 14 days post-injury [90]. This activation of a mesenchymal state may induce angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell migration and clonal expansion. Moreover, this subpopulation of endothelial cells may secrete ECM and inflammatory proteins, thereby indirectly influencing wound healing responses and fibrosis. The above studies demonstrate that the transcriptome of endothelial cells undergoes significant stage-specific changes after MI, providing a systematic and dynamic characterization of the dynamic changes in endothelial cells post-MI.",
        "In combination with genetic lineage tracing techniques, studies have further revealed the adaptive transcriptional and phenotypic changes of endothelial cells in response to the damaged microenvironment, including alterations in pro-inflammatory, metabolic, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic characteristics. This plasticity of endothelial cells in responding to acute stress is crucial for preventing adverse outcomes.",
        "During the inflammatory response following MI, the chemotaxis, recruitment, and infiltration of inflammatory cells are key features of the cardiac microenvironment. Studies have shown that functional changes in endothelial cells play an important role in the recruitment and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Endothelial cells can respond to pro-inflammatory environments and support immune cell infiltration through specific mechanisms. Specifically, endothelial cells release Weibel-Palade bodies containing P-selectin through degranulation, thereby promoting the adhesion and rolling of inflammatory cells [91]. Additionally, endothelial cells can be induced to express ICAM1 and VCAM1. ICAM1 interacts with activated leukocyte β2 integrins to firmly adhere white blood cells to the endothelial layer. The subsequent trans-endothelial migration of leukocytes depends on the synergistic action of ICAM1, VCAM1, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAM) [92]. In the infarcted myocardial tissue, upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-1β, and members of the IL-6 family) induces the synthesis of endothelial cell adhesion molecules [93]. These cytokines not only promote the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules but also induce endothelial cell apoptosis and ROS production, while reducing the biosynthesis of nitric oxide (NO), overall leading to endothelial layer instability [94]. Moreover, the loosening of endothelial cell contacts is thought to facilitate the recruitment of inflammatory cells, which also provides benefits for the role of inflammatory infiltration in post-MI repair.",
        "Compared with other cardiac cells, endothelial cells have relatively fewer mitochondria and do not rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP under normal physiological conditions. This unique metabolic characteristic makes endothelial cells more resistant to ischemic and injury conditions than cardiomyocytes [95]. The metabolic profile of endothelial cells is primarily centered on fatty acid transport, with CD36 and fatty acid-binding proteins (such as fatty acid-binding protein 4 [FABP4] and FABP5) being endothelial-specific proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism [96]. Under ischemic conditions, the induction of hypoxia-inducible factors and oxygen-sensing components (such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase [eNOS] or NADPH oxidase) significantly enhances glycolysis in cells, while fatty acid metabolism is correspondingly reduced [97]. Concurrently, the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and phosphofructokinase B3 (PFKB3) is significantly increased [98], while the expression of the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) is suppressed [99]. Additionally, hypoxia causes glutamine metabolism to shift from an oxidative pathway to a reductive carboxylation state [100]. Hypoxia-induced metabolic changes also involve AMP accumulation, which can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK plays an important role in regulating fatty acid oxidation and NO production in endothelial cells and affects endothelial cell function by modulating inflammatory and angiogenic responses [101]. However, whether endothelial cells in MI models also involve changes in these metabolic pathways and molecular components requires further validation.",
        "In recent years, the development of single-cell RNA sequencing technology has provided a new perspective for studying the dynamic changes of endothelial cells after MI and revealed that endothelial cells can transiently exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype shift (endothelial-mesenchymal transition, EndMT) after MI. This phenomenon has sparked researchers’ keen interest in the specific components that induce functional changes in endothelial cells. Macrophages, as one of the important cell populations in myocardial repair after MI, have been found to significantly upregulate the expression of MMP14 in macrophages on day 7 post-MI. MMP14 can activate latent TGF-β1, thereby enhancing the transmission of the TGF-β1/Smad2 signaling pathway in endothelial cells and inducing the occurrence of EndMT [102]. Further in vitro experiments have shown that the inflammatory environment induced by IL-1β and the profibrotic environment of TGF-β2 can synergistically strongly promote the EndMT process. In this co-stimulation environment, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) plays a key regulatory role [103]. In addition, the metabolic state of endothelial cells also has a significant impact on the EndMT process. It has been found that the knockout of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (Cpt2E) in endothelial cells leads to reduced fatty acid oxidation, increased levels of cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA, and affects the synthesis and secretion of silent information regulator T1 (SIRT) and the cell cycle-related gene MYC proto-oncogene (MYC), all of which have been proven to have an important impact on the EndMT process [104–106]. Mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular oxidative stress are also important inducers of EndMT. It has been found that increased levels of intracellular ROS and the knockdown of oxidative stress inhibitory molecules such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can induce the occurrence of EndMT [107, 108]. However, whether these effects still exist after MI and their specific mechanisms in the in vivo environment are not yet clear.",
        "The generation of new blood vessels after MI is crucial for the repair and functional recovery of damaged myocardium. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, it has been found that resident endothelial cells in the infarct border region exhibit a significant proliferative phenotype after MI. This cell population replenishes the endothelial cells lost due to ischemic injury through clonal proliferation, thereby promoting angiogenesis. Plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (Plvap) has been identified as a key molecule regulating endothelial cell proliferation [109]. However, despite the formation of new blood vessels in the infarcted area, their function and structure are not complete. Analysis using a fluorescence imaging system revealed that although the newly formed blood vessels in the infarcted area are morphologically well-formed, they suffer from insufficient perfusion, structural disorganization, and lack of distinct vascular hierarchy. Specifically, this is manifested as reduced vessel diameter and increased branching. Moreover, capillary endothelial cells exhibit characteristics of insufficient vascular maturation, such as reduced coverage of neural antigen 2 NG-2+ pericytes and type IV collagen [110]. These features indicate that although new blood vessels are formed, their maturation and functionalization processes are hindered, which may affect the efficiency and quality of tissue repair after MI.",
        "Despite numerous studies revealing the dynamic changes of endothelial cells after MI and the transcriptional profiles of endothelial cells at different stages post-MI provided by single-cell RNA sequencing, it is still not possible to fully integrate these dynamic changes with the spatiotemporal sequence of angiogenesis. Therefore, we cannot yet clearly articulate the specific temporal order of endothelial cell dynamic changes. The resolution of this issue requires further basic research to validate and demonstrate the temporal sequence of endothelial cell dynamic changes.",
        "Years of research have demonstrated that the inflammatory response plays a crucial role in the repair and remodeling processes following myocardial injury. Beginning with ischemic damage triggered by coronary occlusion, inflammation rapidly mobilizes nearly all cell types within the cardiac microenvironment, including mast cells, monocytes, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, and induces the large-scale recruitment and activation of neutrophils and monocytes. These cells are not only involved in the clearance and repair of the infarcted area but also have a profound impact on cardiac remodeling and functional recovery. Over time, the inflammatory response transitions from the acute phase to the reparative phase, accompanied by changes in cell types and functional adjustments. Precise regulation of this process is essential for achieving optimal healing outcomes, as excessive or insufficient inflammatory responses can lead to adverse consequences, such as poor myocardial healing or even cardiac rupture. A deeper exploration of the mechanisms of inflammation in MI is of great significance for understanding the key links in disease progression and developing effective therapeutic strategies.",
        "Shortly after the onset of ischemia, resident mast cells release preformed inflammatory mediators such as histamine and TNF-α through degranulation [108]. Concurrently, necrotic myocardial tissue cells release alarmins, which further activate the innate immune system in a process mediated by “danger-associated molecular patterns” (DAMPs) [111, 112]. Alarmins are a diverse group of endogenous signaling molecules that are predominantly released following tissue necrosis and promote the activation and recruitment of innate immune cells by binding to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [113]. Among these, HMGB1 is a key initiator of the inflammatory response following myocardial ischemia. HMGB1 activates downstream pro-inflammatory cascades by interacting with transmembrane receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) [114]. Subsequently, resident macrophages and cardiomyocytes begin to produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which participate in the recruitment of innate immune cells.",
        "In the infarcted myocardial tissue, the expression of two major families of chemokines is significantly increased: the CC and CXC chemokines. CXC chemokines containing the tripeptide sequence Glu-Leu-Arg rapidly increase in the infarcted myocardium and mediate the recruitment of neutrophils [10]. CC chemokine ligand 2 (also known as MCP-1) and CCL7 are rapidly upregulated in the infarcted myocardium and mediate the recruitment of pro-inflammatory phagocytic monocytes, which clear dead cells and matrix debris from the infarcted area [115]. Additionally, interactions involving the CC chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) may be involved in the recruitment of monocyte subsets with anti-inflammatory properties, such as suppressive monocyte subsets and regulatory T cells [116]. Pro-inflammatory macrophage subsets also infiltrate the infarcted area and may help maintain a pro-inflammatory environment within the infarcted myocardium [117].",
        "In animal models of MI, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6 is significantly increased. TNF, which is released following MI, can promote inflammatory damage and induce the synthesis of chemokines and adhesion molecules in the infarcted myocardium [118]. However, TNF has also been noted to protect cardiomyocytes from apoptosis [119]. The differential signaling through TNF receptor 1 and 2 may regulate remodeling in the infarcted heart [120]. IL-1β has been confirmed to mediate the recruitment and activation of leukocytes while delaying the activation of myofibroblasts [12, 121]. Additionally, neutralization of IL-1 has been found to reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo [122]. The upregulation of IL-6 in the infarcted myocardium may regulate inflammation and repair through the IL-6 receptor subunit β and activation of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade [123, 124]. Neutrophil adhesion is almost entirely dependent on CD18 and ICAM-1. Animal studies have shown that recombinant IL-6 can significantly induce the adhesion of yeast activation serum (ZAS)-stimulated neutrophils to cardiomyocytes and the expression of ICAM-1 on cardiomyocytes during ischemia-reperfusion [125]. However, it has been found that knockout of IL-6 in the infarcted myocardium can be compensated by other family members, rendering the absence of IL-6 inconsequential to post-infarction myocardial function and remodeling [126].",
        "In addition, other components within necrotic myocardial tissue can also activate immune responses. For instance, HSPs and ATP released from necrotic cells can activate immune cells. The damaged ECM may also transmit key signals that activate innate immune cells. Low molecular weight hyaluronan and fibronectin fragments can activate Toll-like receptors (such as cell surface receptors TLR2 and TLR4) and serve as important initiators of pro-inflammatory signaling. MMPs produced by cardiac fibroblasts can degrade the ECM, thereby facilitating cell migration to the infarcted area [127]. This process not only aids in the infiltration of inflammatory cells but may also impact cardiomyocyte survival. ECM degradation is associated with cardiomyocyte dislocation, which can lead to cardiomyocyte death as cardiomyocytes lose key survival signals transmitted by the ECM [128]. Activation of the complement system is also involved in transmitting immune responses in infarcted myocardial tissue, and complement inhibition can reduce leukocyte recruitment post-MI. Ischemia-mediated production of ROS is crucial for inflammatory signaling in the infarcted myocardium, promoting leukocyte chemotaxis and infiltration through the activation of all steps in the recruitment of inflammatory cells [129]. Substances like ROS can also activate inflammasomes in fibroblasts, leading to the production of IL-1β, which triggers leukocyte infiltration and cytokine expression [7]. These processes further amplify the inflammatory response and exacerbate myocardial injury. Additionally, non-cardiomyocyte components within cardiac tissue, such as venules endothelial cells, also play an important role in the inflammatory response. Studies have found that in MI models, venules endothelial cells can release CXC chemokines, such as IL-8 (angiogenic factor) and IP-10 (angiostatic factor) [130]. These chemokines not only induce the recruitment of neutrophils but also trigger the release of MCP-1, promoting monocyte migration [131]. Collectively, these events induce the large-scale production and recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes, which are considered independent risk factors for adverse outcomes following MI.",
        "After accumulating in the heart, neutrophils and monocytes actively participate in the inflammatory cascade. Initially, their primary function is to clear dead components, such as dead and dying cardiomyocytes. Myeloid-epithelial-reproductive tyrosine kinase (MerTK) in macrophages is a necessary component for the clearance of apoptotic cardiomyocytes by macrophages [132]. Type I interferons and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) have been shown to be another important component in inducing and clearing apoptotic cardiomyocytes. Studies have found that MI triggers the transformation of cardiac macrophages into an “interferon-inducible cell (IFNIC)” macrophage subtype, while activating the intracellular IRF3-interferon axis, thereby promoting inflammatory cell infiltration and cardiac dysfunction [133]. Interestingly, apoptotic cardiomyocytes play a crucial role in this process. Experiments have shown that during MI, apoptotic cardiomyocytes release double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to activate the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) in macrophages, which in turn promotes the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP binds to the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein (a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum) and activates the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-dependent IRF3, thereby promoting the production of IFN-β. Macrophages induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes by secreting inflammatory factors such as IFN-β and CXCL10. H-151, a selective inhibitor of STING protein, has been found to reduce IFN-β production in macrophages, thereby alleviating cardiomyocyte apoptosis and fibroblast activation [134]. These immune cells can produce proteases that help digest necrotic myocardial tissue and further release inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF, amplifying the inflammatory response through their effects on leukocytes, endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes. As time progresses post-MI, the number of neutrophils gradually decreases and almost completely disappears by day 7, while monocytes continue to accumulate in the ischemic heart. They primarily originate from extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and are continuously recruited to the damaged myocardium, where they differentiate into cardiac macrophages and influence the inflammatory process [135].",
        "The repair of damaged tissue relies on the timely inhibition and effective control of the inflammatory response. During the proliferative phase, the inflammatory response gradually subsides, and tissue repair mechanisms are initiated. The main characteristics of this stage are the disappearance of neutrophils and the appearance of Ly6 C(low) macrophages. Studies have shown that almost all cell types in the cardiac microenvironment, as well as a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and chemokines, are involved in the transition from inflammation to the repair process [136].",
        "Macrophages, as key inflammatory cells, participate in tissue remodeling during the proliferative phase. Research has found that the phenotype of macrophages in the infarcted myocardium undergoes the most significant dynamic changes, indicating a shift from early pro-inflammatory M1-type Ly6 C(high) macrophage infiltration to a predominance of late reparative M2-type Ly6 C(low) macrophages [137]. Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4 A1) has been shown to promote the transition of macrophages from a pro-inflammatory phenotype to a reparative phenotype by inhibiting the expression of IL-6, TNF, and MMP9 [138]. Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) can induce the differentiation of M2-type macrophages and promote the activation of myofibroblasts as well as the expression of monocyte/macrophage-derived proteins, thereby facilitating repair in the infarcted area [139]. Additionally, neutrophils can induce macrophages with high phagocytic capacity for apoptotic cells by releasing neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) [140]. In the myocardial infarction mouse model lacking IRAK-M, enhanced inflammatory responses, increased protease activation, and increased infiltration of CD11-b+/Ly6 C(high) pro-inflammatory monocytes were observed, while the matrix-degrading activity of fibroblasts was significantly weakened [15]. These reparative macrophages promote fibrosis and angiogenesis by producing factors such as TGF-β, VEGF, and myeloid-derived growth factor (MYDGF) [134, 141].",
        "Moreover, the efficient clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes can activate anti-inflammatory signals, facilitating the transition from the inflammatory response to the repair process. For example, the absence of MerTK leads to the accumulation of apoptotic cardiomyocytes, slowed clearance of inflammatory cytokines, and reduced cardiac contractile function [132]. IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK-3/IRAK-M), an anti-inflammatory mediator secreted by fibroblasts and macrophages in the infarct zone, inhibits the inflammatory response following MI by reducing cellular responsiveness to pro-inflammatory signals, expressing decoy cytokines and chemokine receptors, and releasing soluble anti-inflammatory mediators [14]. The transition from inflammation to repair is also accompanied by the accumulation of mast cells, which peaks on day 7 post-infarction. However, inflammatory inhibition does not appear to be the primary role of mast cells. Studies have shown that mast cells can protect cardiac contractile function by promoting the phosphorylation of tropomyosin I and myosin-binding protein C through tryptase-induced protein kinase A activity [142].",
        "Endothelial cells also play an important role in this process. They attract pericytes and smooth muscle cells by secreting PDGF-B. The interaction of PDGF-B with PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β exerts fibrotic effects. It has been found that activation of the PDGF-B/PDGFR-β pathway in infarcted myocardium mediates the formation of a new vascular coverage cell layer, promotes vascular maturation, and inhibits the infiltration of inflammatory cells. Activation of the PDGF-B/PDGFR-α pathway, although it does not affect vascular maturation, can work synergistically with the former to reduce collagen deposition and inhibit fibrosis [32]. A few weeks later, the inflammatory regulation and pro-repair functions of neutrophils, monocytes, mast cells, and various lymphocyte subsets gradually weaken, and the number of immune cell populations gradually returns to homeostasis levels.",
        "Notably, studies have indicated that immune cells may also be involved in ventricular remodeling in non-infarcted areas. Previous research has shown that heart failure following MI may primarily be due to remodeling of the left ventricular wall in non-infarcted areas. In mouse models, researchers found that recruitment of monocytes also occurs in the remote myocardium from the infarct, even significantly increasing and peaking on day 10 post-ischemia. This phenomenon is mediated by both local macrophage proliferation and monocyte recruitment, likely activated by chemokines such as MCP-1 and the MAPK pathway, which is activated by increased wall tension due to ventricular remodeling [143, 144]. The above studies demonstrate that the inflammatory response plays an important role in multiple stages following MI, including remodeling of the remote myocardium from the infarct. Further exploration of the mechanisms mediating immune cell accumulation in this area and its prognostic implications will provide new insights for the treatment of MI.",
        "The term “stem cell” is commonly used to describe a population of undifferentiated cells that have the potential to differentiate into various specific cell types and possess the ability to self-renew. To date, researchers have isolated several stem cell populations with cardiogenic potential, including human adult stem cells and pluripotent stem cells (PSCs).",
        "PSCs are stem cells that have the ability to differentiate into any cell type in the body, and they mainly include embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).",
        "ESCs are primarily derived from the inner cell mass of embryos that have developed to the blastocyst stage (approximately 5–6 days) during in vitro fertilization and are the earliest studied type of PSCs. ESCs have extremely high differentiation potential and can theoretically differentiate into any tissue cell type in an adult animal. Additionally, ESCs can proliferate indefinitely in vitro while maintaining an undifferentiated state [145]. Boheler et al. first reported the potential of ESCs to generate functional cardiomyocytes (CMCs) in vitro [146]. Studies have shown that VEGF, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and FGF2 may induce cardiogenesis and differentiation of ESCs by activating signaling pathways such as phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3 K) IA class, protein kinase C (PKC), and Wnt/β-catenin [147]. However, since the source of ESCs is related to early embryos, their research involves ethical issues, which limits the conduct of research to some extent.",
        "iPSCs are a type of pluripotent stem cell generated by reprogramming somatic cells (such as skin cells or blood cells) through genetic reprogramming techniques to acquire properties similar to ESCs. This technology was first reported in 2006 by Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka, who reprogrammed adult cells into a pluripotent state by introducing specific transcription factors (such as Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) [148]. iPSCs have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into cells of all three germ layers. Compared with ESCs, iPSCs can avoid ethical controversies and can be prepared from the patient’s own cells, reducing the possibility of immune rejection [149]. Numerous studies have shown that iPSCs can successfully differentiate into functional CMCs and vascular endothelial cells [150] and form functional three-dimensional cardiac tissue [151]. However, the direct implantation of undifferentiated ESCs and iPSCs has been found to cause teratoma formation, which is another important limitation for the clinical application of these cells.",
        "SPCs are a class of cells with self-renewal ability and differentiation potential (tissue-specific) that exist in mature tissues. These cells may originate from stem cell populations left over from embryonic development to maintain tissue homeostasis and repair damaged tissues [152]. Among them, bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) have been proven to be useful for improving myocardial injury after MI [153].",
        "BM-MNCs and MSCs are the most commonly used stem cells in clinical research promoting cardiac tissue regeneration. BM-MNCs are a population of mononuclear cells isolated from bone marrow, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). BM-MNCs can be obtained through bone marrow aspiration, do not require extensive expansion, and can be separated by density gradient centrifugation. They are the “first-generation stem cells” used in cardiovascular disease clinical trials. Studies have shown that BM-MNCs can directly differentiate into vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells to form new blood vessels [154]; or secrete pro-angiogenic factors and endothelial cell growth factors in an autocrine/paracrine manner to promote blood vessel growth [155]. With the continuous progress in the understanding of stem cell biology and cell separation techniques, researchers have begun to use purified progenitor cell populations, such as MSCs [156] and CD34+ cells.",
        "MSCs originate from the mesoderm and can be isolated from various tissues such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, placenta, umbilical cord, and even dental pulp. In addition to their self-renewal and multidifferentiation capabilities, MSCs have been widely studied for their low immunogenicity and strong paracrine and immunomodulatory functions. Studies have shown that VEGF, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), bFGF, and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and their downstream signaling can actively stimulate the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of MSCs [157], which is of great significance in cardiac tissue regeneration. Moreover, the lack of major histocompatibility class II markers in MSCs makes them an excellent choice for allogeneic transplantation [158].",
        "HSCs and EPCs are cells that specifically express CD34 and CD133. Among them, EPCs are recruited to the peripheral blood after injury and are called circulating progenitor cells when isolated from the blood. Circulating progenitor cells can differentiate into blood cell lineages and endothelial cells and have pro-angiogenic effects [159]. CD34+ cells are progenitor cells with the potential to differentiate into endothelial cells. In vitro, they can proliferate and form tubular structures during culture and exhibit functions of endothelial cells, such as the uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein (acLDL) and response to molecular stimuli like acetylcholine. In animal models, CD34+ cells have also been shown to integrate into newly formed blood vessels in ischemic tissues and form vascular walls together with host vascular endothelial cells [160].",
        "The paracrine/autocrine activity of MSCs and BM-MNCs is considered an important mechanism for promoting cell survival, growth, and eventual differentiation into myocardial tissue. In particular, MSCs require in vitro expansion and thus cannot be used on the same day of collection like BM-MNCs, which may limit their application as autologous transplants for the treatment of acute diseases. Adipose tissue-derived regenerative cell populations are obtained from liposuction samples, and their stromal fraction contains multipotent cells that can differentiate into multiple lineages. These cells can also be administered on the same day of collection and have been shown to contain a higher proportion of MSCs and CD34+ cells.",
        "CPCs are the only recognized stem cells with cardiomyogenic potential that appear during embryonic development and play an important role in cardiac development, repair, and regeneration [161]. Studies have shown that after transplantation into the infarcted heart, CPCs can not only replenish damaged cardiomyocytes but also differentiate into vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells, thereby promoting capillary formation, improving blood circulation in the infarcted area, and facilitating repair of the infarcted myocardium [162].",
        "Cortical bone-derived stem cells (CBSCs) are a subtype of mesenchymal stem cells derived from the cortical bone, with the ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple lineages, mainly into chondrocytes and osteoblasts. However, they have stronger proliferative capacity and lineage differentiation stability. Importantly, studies have found that CBSCs can promote the repair of damaged hearts in the following ways: (1) secreting pro-angiogenic factors to stimulate endogenous angiogenesis; (2) differentiating into functional mature cardiomyocytes and vascular cells [163]; and (3) exerting immunomodulatory effects [164]. Additionally, it has been found that mouse cortical bone-derived stem cells (mCBSCs) can secrete high levels of TGF-β1, which promotes the self-migration of mCBSCs and the activation and differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts [165], contributing to tissue repair and scar maturation after MI. CBSCs have also been shown to produce cytokines and growth factors that promote the growth, chemotaxis, differentiation, and survival of T cells and macrophages, such as TIMP1, CXCL12, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). CXCL12 strongly attracts lymphocytes [166] and protects cardiomyocytes from apoptosis [167]. M-CSF induces the differentiation of bone marrow cells into macrophages, induces an immunosuppressive phenotype, and induces the production of CCL2, which acts as a potent chemoattractant for lymphocytes and plays a key role in infarct healing [115]. Experiments in a porcine MI model have also shown that intracardiac injection of allogeneic CBSCs can reduce pathological remodeling of myocardial structure and function and improve left ventricular functional reserve [168].",
        "Stem cell therapy holds the promise of reversing myocardial damage and improving cardiac function, a potential that starkly contrasts with most existing medical therapies, which can only alleviate cardiovascular symptoms. Over the past 20 years, more than 200 stem cell clinical trials targeting cardiovascular diseases have been conducted, with the majority of cell types demonstrating good safety profiles. However, the rapid translation of clinical trials has largely outpaced our understanding of their mechanisms of action. Given that myocardial injury may progressively lead to severe ventricular remodeling over time, it is crucial to delve into the key mechanisms by which stem cell therapy affects myocardial remodeling.",
        "Studies have found that implanted stem cells can promote regeneration of damaged cardiac tissue through three main mechanisms: (1) secretion of various paracrine or autocrine factors into the damaged cardiac microenvironment; (2) induction of proliferation and differentiation of endogenous CSPCs; and (3) generation of new CMCs and vascular endothelial cells (VECs) in the damaged area. This study primarily discusses the effects and mechanisms of non-cardiac-derived stem cells on ventricular remodeling after MI.",
        "Necrosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes are among the earliest and most severe pathological changes following MI. Traditionally, cardiomyocytes have been considered terminally differentiated cells with little to no capacity for further division and proliferation. Consequently, non-contractile scar tissue gradually replaces the damaged myocardial tissue in the infarcted area, severely compromising the functional and structural integrity of the damaged region. Replenishing lost cardiomyocytes has long been the primary goal of stem cell therapy for MI. Although subsequent research has revealed that cardiomyocyte regeneration is not the main mechanism of stem cell therapy, the potential of different types of stem cells to differentiate into cardiomyocyte lineages and their applications have still been widely recognized and validated.",
        "Currently, various stem cell lineages have been used to differentiate or generate cardiomyocyte-like cell (CLCs) types, including BMSCs, umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, human embryonic stem cells, human induced pluripotent stem cells, and resident cardiac stromal cells (characteristics and distinctions of CLCs derived from different sources are detailed in Table 1). Among them, MSCs are the most extensively studied type of stem cells.",
        "Table 1Advantages and disadvantages of differentiating CLCs from various stem cell sourcesCell typeAdvantagesDisadvantagesReferencesBM-MSCsLow risk of immune rejection: lack of surface markersLimited differentiation capacity: low efficiency in differentiating into cardiomyocytes [169, 170]Possess immunomodulatory propertiesHigh passage number in vitro culture affects proliferation and differentiationEasily accessible, widely availableTumorigenic risk: potential for tumor formationUmbilical Cord Stem Cells (UCSCs)Low risk of immune rejection: lack of surface markersPotential for thrombosis: associated with coagulation cascade [171]Possess immunomodulatory propertiesTumorigenic risk: potential for tumor formationEasily accessible, no risk to mother or infantAdipose-Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs)Low risk of immune rejection: lack of surface markersHigh passage number in vitro culture affects proliferation and differentiation [169, 170]Possess immunomodulatory propertiesTumorigenic risk: potential for tumor formationEasily accessible, widely availableAnatomically close to myocardium, potentialy similar genetic lineageHuman Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs)Capable of differentiating into all three germ layers, high differentiation potentialEthical issues: involves embryo destruction [169, 172]Can produce a higher proportion of cardiomyocytesRisk of immune rejection: potential for host immune responseGenomic instability: potential for genetic mutations in differentiated cellsHuman Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSC)Capable of differentiating into all three germ layersLow differentiation efficacy: limited cardiomyocyte yield [169, 172]Fewer ethical issuesGenomic instability: potential for genetic mutations during inductionCan be induced from patient’s own cells, reducing immune rejection",
        "Advantages and disadvantages of differentiating CLCs from various stem cell sources",
        "BMSCs can be specifically induced to differentiate into CLCs under in vitro drug induction or in vivo myocardial microenvironment simulation conditions, exhibiting functional characteristics of cardiomyocytes. Numerous components have been shown to promote the differentiation of BMSCs into cardiomyocytes, including chemical agents (such as 5-azacytidine [5-aza]), miRNAs, cytokines (such as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1]), and members of the TGF-β superfamily.",
        "Wakitani et al. first reported the in vitro differentiation of MSCs into cardiomyocytes, primarily through the use of the cytidine analog 5-aza. Studies have found that MSCs typically contain a methylated region that determines myogenic transformation, which is transcriptionally inactive under normal conditions. 5-aza is a demethylating agent that can bind to repressor proteins on the promoters specific for cardiomyocyte differentiation, causing demethylation and thereby initiating the differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes [173]. Under the stimulation of 5-aza, research has observed structures similar to cardiomyocytes [174]. Xing et al. found that the combined use of 5-aza and Ang II can induce the expression of cardiomyocyte proteins (such as cTnI) and α-actin, and proposed that it may function by promoting the production of TGF-β1 [175], although the specific mechanism has not been elucidated. However, despite the promising role of 5-aza in stem cell differentiation, its potential carcinogenicity may limit its application in therapy [176].",
        "MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs approximately 22 nucleotides in length that act as negative regulators of gene expression by binding to the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of mRNA. Studies have shown that miRNAs play an important role in promoting the differentiation of BMSCs into cardiomyocytes. For example, miR-1 can promote cardiomyogenic differentiation of stem cells by targeting Delta-like 1 (Dll-1, a Notch ligand), as evidenced by increased expression of cardiomyocyte-specific genes (such as cTnI, cTnT, and myosin heavy chain 6 [MYH6]) [177]. miR-1–2 has been shown to promote the differentiation of BMSCs into cardiomyocytes by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway [178]. However, the specific mechanisms in both pathways have not been clearly demonstrated. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments with miR-124 have shown that miR-124 can influence the differentiation of BMSCs into cardiomyocytes by targeting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/GATA-4 pathway, with miR-124 leading to inhibition of cardiomyogenic differentiation and reduction of cardiomyocyte potassium channel currents [179]. It is worth noting that although BMSCs treated with miRNAs can express cardiac-specific genes, these cells still lack the morphological characteristics of cardiomyocytes, indicating the need for further functional studies of BMSC-derived CLCs as a basis for stem cell therapy.",
        "Cytokines, as important paracrine factors, also play a significant role in the differentiation of stem cells into CLCs. Studies have shown that the combined application of IGF-1 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) can inhibit apoptosis of BMSCs after implantation and increase angiogenesis. Notably, levels of cardiac-specific markers (such as cTnT, GATA binding protein 4 [GATA4], NK2 homeobox 5 [NKx2.5], and connexin 43 [Cx43]) in BMSCs are also increased [180]. This synergistic effect has been validated in a porcine MI model, where intracoronary infusion of IGF-1 and HGF was found to significantly increase the number of c-kit+ endogenous cardiac stem/progenitor cells (epCSCs) in the infarcted area and promote the formation of new myocardium (including cardiomyocytes and microvessels) in the infarcted and surrounding areas [181]. IGF-1 itself has been shown to induce the differentiation of BMSCs into CLCs through the PI3 K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways [182]. bFGF is a heparin-binding growth factor that is thought to induce the differentiation of BMSCs into cardiomyocytes during embryogenesis, although it is not essential for cardiomyocyte development. However, the combination of bFGF and the steroid drug hydrocortisone can induce the differentiation of sternal BMSCs into cardiomyocytes, with significant upregulation of cTnI, cTnC, and Cx43 in cell cultures [183]. The role of bFGF in post-MI repair has also been validated in a canine MI model, where retrograde coronary infusion of bFGF and BMSCs, compared to infusion of BMSCs alone, resulted in increased cell implantation efficiency, enhanced vascular differentiation, and significant thickening of the ventricular wall [184]. This suggests that this novel combination therapy and delivery method may be a promising strategy for cardiac repair following ischemic injury. IL-1, a member of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, has been shown to be significantly expressed after myocardial injury. Studies have found that IL-1β also has a positive effect on cardiac differentiation in vitro, characterized by significant increases in cardiomyocyte-related protein expression, and its combination with 5-aza (5 ng/ml) has been shown to be more effective than single-agent treatment [185]. However, despite the significant expression of cardiomyocyte-related molecules in BMSCs treated with the above cytokines, the functional characteristics of these cells have not been fully demonstrated. The addition of functional studies of cells will be the next direction of research on the role of cytokines in the differentiation of stem cells into CLCs.",
        "TGF-β1 and BMP belong to the TGF-β superfamily and are involved in regulating multiple biological processes, including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration. Studies have shown that under the induction of TGF-β1, BMSCs significantly increase the expression of cardiac-specific markers. This effect is even more pronounced when treated with autologous serum, and the cell proliferation rate is also increased [186]. Moreover, TGF-β1 has been proven to potentially participate in the differentiation of BMSCs into cardiomyocytes induced by electrical stimulation [187]. Research has found that after treating BMSCs with BMP2, BMP2 shows the ability to enhance the differentiation of BMSCs into CLCs, both in terms of cellular ultrastructural characteristics and the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins [188]. As key molecules in tissue growth and development, validating the role of the TGF-β superfamily in post-MI myocardial remodeling in humans will significantly enhance our understanding of cell therapy.",
        "In addition to the aforementioned regulatory components, some novel biomaterial carriers as the microenvironment for cell culture may also affect cell proliferation and differentiation. For example, graphene and collagen scaffolds have been proven to promote the differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes. Studies have found that when BMSCs are seeded and cultured on graphene, the expression levels of cardiac-specific markers in these cells are significantly higher than those in cells cultured on coverslips. Moreover, the BMSCs on graphene also show significant expression of matricular proteins related to cardiomyocyte differentiation, including collagen types I, III, and IV, fibronectin, and laminin [189]. When BMSCs are directly cultured on collagen scaffolds, it has been found that these cells can produce more cardiomyocyte-specific proteins and secrete cardiac trophic factors such as BMP4, HGF, VEGF, and bFGF, while exhibiting fewer fibrotic characteristics [190]. This highlights the importance of ECM in the differentiation process of stem cells. As the microenvironment for cell interaction, ECM not only provides structural support for damaged myocardium but also enhances the differentiation potential of stem cells. In addition, cell membrane proteins (such as caveolin-1), ion channel proteins (such as vanilloid receptor 1 [VR-1]), and epigenetic modification molecules (such as histone deacetylase 1 [HDAC1]) have also been proven to promote the differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes. Studies have found that treating BMSCs with siRNA for caveolin-1 can enhance the expression of cardiomyocyte markers during BMSCs differentiation by regulating the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway [191]. VR-1 is a Ca2+ channel, and its ligand capsaicin, as a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) agonist, has been proven to promote the maturation of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (mESC-CMs) [192]. In BMSCs, knockdown of VR-1 results in significantly lower mRNA and protein expression of α-MHC, α-actin, and Nkx2.5 compared to the control group, and the study suggests that this may be mediated through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway [193]. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in cell differentiation. Studies have found that treating BMSCs with HDAC1-RNAi lentiviral vectors results in significantly higher expression of cardiomyocyte-specific genes in these cells compared to the control group. Treating BMSCs with non-specific HDAC inhibitors (such as valproic acid and trichostatin A) can also achieve the same effect [194]. In addition, recent studies have also focused on nuclear reprogramming. Studies have found that inducing hMSCs with neonatal rat cardiomyocyte lysates (containing cytoplasmic and nuclear components) can promote the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins [195], thereby regulating the gene expression patterns within stem cells. This reveals the mechanisms by which stem cells differentiate into CLCs and provides a direction for promoting their transdifferentiation.",
        "Mesenchymal cells isolated from the umbilical cord have been proven to differentiate into all three germ layers and ultimately into CLCs [196]. Among them, amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (AF-MSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells from Wharton’s Jelly (WJ-MSCs) have shown extremely high differentiation potential in vitro. Under the influence of 5-aza, both can exhibit increased expression of GATA4, cTnT, α-actin, and Cx43 [197].",
        "Various types of ADSCs have been explored for their potential to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, including those derived from white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), epicardial adipocytes, pericardial adipocytes, and omental adipocytes. Research has indicated that BAT holds greater potential as a source of cardiac cells compared to WAT. Gene expression analysis has revealed that BAT significantly expresses a variety of cardiac-specific genes, including Nkx2.5, GATA4, myosin light chain 2a (MLC2a), MLC2v, cTnT, as well as VEGF and IGF-1. Additionally, it has been found that treating WAT with VEGF and IGF-1 can increase the expression of cardiac-specific genes [198]. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been found to possess BAT signature genes, such as high expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), and is believed to have similar protective effects on the heart [199]. However, studies have shown that compared to induction with 5-aza, transfecting EAT-derived stem cells with retroviral vectors carrying transcription factors (such as estrogen-related receptor gamma [ESRRG], GATA4, myocyte enhancer factor 2 C [MEF2 C], myocardin [MYOCD], TBX5, and zinc finger protein multitype 2 [ZFPM2]) can significantly induce differentiation into cardiomyocytes and upregulate the expression of Actn2 and cTnT [200].",
        "ESCs possess pluripotency and self-renewal capabilities, enabling them to differentiate into all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). The determination of their cell fate is regulated by a variety of signaling pathways and transcription factors. Studies have shown that miR-1 and miR-133 are significantly enriched in the mesoderm of differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESs), but they exhibit opposite effects when further differentiating into cardiomyocytes or skeletal muscle cells: miR-1 promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation, while miR-133 inhibits this process. Further experiments have demonstrated that miR-1 promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation by inhibiting Dll-1 expression and blocking the Notch signaling pathway in both mouse and human ESCs [201]. Additionally, supplementing IGF-1 in mES suspensions has been shown to enhance the efficiency of cell differentiation into host organ-specific cells after implantation into acute ischemic myocardial injury areas, promoting the expression of α-sarcomeric actin and significantly increasing ventricular wall thickness [181]. BMP2 has been proven to promote ESCs differentiation into cardiomyocytes downstream of HDAC1 and can restore the cells’ calcium transient capability and responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation [202]. The differentiation of ESCs into cardiomyocytes requires the participation of serum-containing medium. Adding fetal bovine serum (FBS) during the hanging drop stage and the first 24 h of adherent culture enabled ESCs treated with BMP4 to achieve cardiomyocyte differentiation. The differentiated cells exhibited expression of cardiac-specific genes, chronotropic responses to active drugs, and numerous intercellular connections, although the myofibrils mainly presented an immature phenotype [203].",
        "The maturation of cardiomyocytes is a complex process involving the transition of their structural, functional, and electrophysiological characteristics to a mature state. While significant progress has been made in the differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes to promote cardiac tissue regeneration, how to further induce these cells to mature into functional cardiomyocytes and effectively integrate them into normal cardiac tissue remains one of the key challenges in this field. Studies have shown that recapitulating the natural cellular microenvironment and allowing implanted cells to follow the physiological processes of cardiac development are crucial directions for achieving this goal. Embryonic developmental biology research has revealed that during embryonic development, cardiomyocytes are subject to comprehensive regulation by a variety of environmental factors, including stimulation by surrounding metabolites, mechanical forces, ECM remodeling, and electrical stimulation [204, 205]. Additionally, the morphological characteristics of cardiomyocytes in different planes are also important for their maturation [206].",
        "Electrical stimulation, which is closely related to the contractility of cardiomyocytes, has been relatively well-developed in promoting cardiomyocyte maturation. The contraction of cardiomyocytes is triggered by the influx of ions through voltage-gated channels. Under electrical stimulation, the resting membrane potential of immature cardiomyocytes is reduced, and spontaneous contractions can occur [207]. For example, researchers stimulated hiPSC-CMs at a frequency of 1 Hz for 5 days, then increased the frequency by 1 Hz daily until it reached 6 Hz. After a week of stepwise increasing stimulation, the frequency was reset to 1 Hz and continued until day 28. The results showed that this stepwise increasing pacing frequency significantly induced the expression of Cx43, led to more orderly sarcomeric structures within the cells, and resulted in a mature cell phenotype [208]. Further studies compared low-frequency stepwise increase (frequency increased from 1 Hz to 3 Hz daily) with high-frequency stepwise increase (frequency increased from 1 Hz to 6 Hz), and found that the high-frequency regimen significantly enhanced the structural and electrophysiological functions of the regenerated myocardial tissue [209].",
        "Mechanical forces have a direct impact on the maturation of the cardiac conduction system. Current research attempts to reconstruct the mechanical stimulation environment in vitro by simulating cyclic stretching and mimicking the stiffness of the myocardial tissue substrate. On the one hand, using hydrogels and bioreactor systems to apply cyclic stretching and pulsatile flow, it has been found that this stimulation can significantly upregulate the expression of cardiac-related genes (such as β-MHC, cardiac troponin, etc.) in PSC-CMs [210]. On the other hand, culturing cells derived from cardiac spheroids on polyacrylamide gels with a stiffness gradient (8–21 kPa), the results showed that cells gradually exhibited well-aligned myofibrils and longitudinal calcium ion propagation [211], which reflects the maturation and functional optimization of the cells.",
        "During development, the energy metabolism of cardiomyocytes shifts from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, producing ATP that is crucial for cardiac contractile function, which is an important sign of metabolic maturation in cardiomyocytes [212]. One method to promote metabolic maturation is to culture stem cells in a medium that mimics the metabolic environment of the adult heart, inducing cells to shift towards oxidative metabolism. For example, it has been found that when iPSC-CMs are placed in a specific medium supplemented with glucose, calcium, albumin-bound fatty acids, etc., contractile cardiomyocytes with spontaneous beating ability appear [204]. In addition, the expression of ion-specific genes (such as sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 5 [SCN5 A], potassium inwardly-rectifying channel subfamily J member 4 [KCNJ4], and ryanodine receptor 2 [RYR2]) and contraction-related proteins (such as troponin, myosin light chain, myosin heavy chain [MYH], etc.) also significantly increased [213]. Another method is to activate the AMPK pathway, a key protein in energy metabolism, by upregulating genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, thereby promoting the metabolic maturation of cardiomyocytes. For example, small molecules such as thyroid hormones and glucocorticoids, as well as regulating hypoxic conditions to trigger adaptive mechanisms in cardiomyocytes, can all promote their metabolic maturation [214, 215].",
        "Cardiac tissue relies on its unique 3D structure and intercellular gap junctions to effectively transmit contractile impulse signals. In vitro simulated 3D cardiac structures aim to support the maturation of cardiomyocyte metabolism and function by mimicking the in vivo physiological microenvironment. Typically, this model is composed of a 3D scaffold seeded with various cell types, including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. These cellular components collaborate within the 3D scaffold to perform key functions such as biosynthesis, tissue structure formation, and nutritional support, thereby promoting the maturation and functional integration of cardiomyocytes [216]. Studies have found that compared with 2D differentiation, the expression of mature cardiac gene markers (such as gap junction protein alpha 5 [GJA5]/Cx40, potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 5 [KCNA5], and calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha 1G [CACNA1G]) in 3D cell aggregates significantly increased, and ATP production increased by 10% [217]. In addition, some studies have inserted microfluidic devices to precisely control the cellular microenvironment in 3D co-culture systems and found that by controlling the flow of nutrients and oxygen, the microenvironment for cardiomyocyte maturation has been further optimized [218].",
        "“Intercellular differentiation” refers to inducing the differentiation of stem cells by co-culturing with cardiomyocytes. For example, a study differentiated CLCs from HF-hiPSCs reprogrammed from skin fibroblasts of heart failure patients and found that functional integration and synchronized electrical activity occurred when co-cultured with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, a characteristic that was also verified in rat transplantation experiments [219]. This provides a new direction for the repair of cardiac tissue after MI, but its effectiveness and safety still need to be further proven by mechanistic studies.",
        "In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of myocardial regeneration and cardiac remodeling with stem cell therapy. Numerous successful transplantation experiments in small animal models have provided strong support for the application of stem cell therapy in cardiac repair, demonstrating its potential for promoting myocardial regeneration. However, as research has delved deeper, especially in large animal models (particularly non-human primates such as pigs and monkeys), researchers have found that although the formation of new myocardium leads to improved cardiac function, it is also accompanied by frequent occurrences of arrhythmias. These arrhythmias mainly include serious issues such as ventricular premature contractions and ventricular tachycardia. For instance, in one study, researchers transplanted differentiated human ESC-CMs into the hearts of pigs 3 weeks after infarction. The results showed that the contractile function of the cardiac region in this group of animals was significantly enhanced compared to the control group, but monomorphic ventricular tachycardia occurred frequently within 3–4 days after treatment [220]. Similarly, in another study, cynomolgus monkeys with MI that received hiPSC-CMs also exhibited similar arrhythmias [221]. It is speculated that the occurrence of these arrhythmias may be related to the differences in heart size among animals. The larger hearts of large animals lead to more pronounced differences in the volume of transplanted cells and derived myocardial tissue, making it easier to induce electrophysiological abnormalities. In addition, compared with small animals, large animals and humans have slower heart rates, and the transplanted cardiomyocytes may more easily form pacemaker rhythms or reentrant circuits, thereby leading to the occurrence of arrhythmias [222]. It is worth noting that the cardiac structure and function of non-human primates are more similar to those of humans, so the results of these animal models can better reflect the potential problems that may arise after human stem cell transplantation. This also suggests that we need to conduct more targeted research before further advancing human trials to overcome potential arrhythmia complications. In addition, research should delve into the adverse reactions that stem cell therapy may cause and their management strategies, thereby providing a more solid scientific basis for clinical applications.",
        "Overall, both cell and animal model studies have demonstrated the strong potential of stem cell therapy in post-MI treatment and myocardial regeneration (as shown in Fig. 1). Some initial translational products have also shown positive effects. For example, one study used a cell-scaffold combination composed of human Wharton’s jelly mesenchymal stem cells and a novel composite material (consisting of polyethylene glycol (PEG), hyaluronic acid, and chitosan) and injected it into the infarcted myocardium of rabbits. The results showed that this combination could significantly improve cardiac function and promote angiogenesis and myocardial regeneration [222]. However, despite these encouraging initial findings, rigorous clinical trials and large-scale population cohort studies are still needed to comprehensively validate the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapy before it can be widely applied in clinical settings.",

        "The inflammatory microenvironment following MI significantly impacts the efficacy of cell therapy. Studies have shown that the post-MI inflammatory microenvironment may exert inhibitory effects on implanted stem cells. Therefore, an in-depth analysis of the interaction between the post-MI inflammatory microenvironment and implanted stem cells is crucial for optimizing stem cell therapy. As previously described, the inflammatory phase following MI involves nearly all components of the cardiac microenvironment, including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, ECM, endothelial cells, and the immune system. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the infiltration and differentiation of inflammatory cells are the main characteristics of this phase.",
        "Research has found that the survival rate of BMSCs in ischemic areas significantly decreases in the early post-transplantation period [223]. This phenomenon is closely related to the inflammatory cells and cytokines within the inflammatory environment. For example, cytokines such as TNF-α, the IL-1 family, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-Ɣ, and their associated signaling pathways are closely related to the survival and function of stem cells. Natural killer cells (NK cells), which are immune cells with potent cytotoxicity, play a key role in the rejection of implanted cells or tissues. Studies have shown that upregulation of major histocompatibility antigens (MHC), especially class I and II, in implanted stem cells and/or differentiated cardiomyocytes can lead to rejection of transplanted cells through the cytotoxic response of NK cells [224]. In addition, some cytokine receptors and their ligands, such as TNF-R1, IL-1R, apoptosis antigen 1 (APO-1)/FAS, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R), can induce apoptosis and tissue necrosis by activating the NF-κB cascade [225]. NF-κB is the primary responder to cytokines and other harmful factors such as ROS. Studies have shown that NF-κB, once activated by “death ligands,” can directly induce apoptosis of implanted stem cells through overexpression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) gene [226]. These “death ligands” can also mediate the autophagy cascade during cardiac injury by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Ras pathways [227]. In MSCs, the TNF-α and IFN-Ɣ network can synergistically enhance cell autophagy and apoptosis by stimulating the ROS/ERK1/3 pathway, inducing expression of the BH-3 domain protein Beclin-1, and inhibiting expression of the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) [227]. Moreover, TNF-α and its signaling pathways can inhibit the differentiation of CSPCs into cardiomyocytes and promote their development into catecholaminergic-like cells. The mechanism may involve stimulation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways around the infarct area by TNF-R1 and TNF-R2, thereby reducing the differentiation and proliferation potential of CSPCs [228].",
        "Hypoxia-mediated oxidative stress plays a significant role in inducing apoptosis of stem cells. Studies have found that hypoxia can significantly reduce the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, while increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (such as Bax, Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad), and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β)) [229]. In addition, ROS-mediated specific protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum and stimulation of the Ras and ERK1/2 signaling pathways can induce autophagic cell death [230, 231]. It has also been found that TNF-α can inhibit the secretion of stem cell factor (SCF), which is an important factor for inducing cardiac cell differentiation [232].",
        "The immunomodulatory effects of stem cell therapy within the post-MI inflammatory microenvironment have become a research hotspot. Stem cells primarily exert immunomodulation through paracrine effects and direct cell-to-cell contact, regulating the survival, proliferation, migration, and phenotypic transformation of host immune cells by secreting various immunosuppressive soluble factors, cytokines, and chemokines.",
        "MSCs are generally considered to possess immune evasion characteristics, and the inflammatory microenvironment can significantly activate the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs [233]. Studies have shown that high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as INF-Ɣ, TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-1β, can act synergistically to activate MSCs and polarize them towards an immunosuppressive phenotype [234]. Additionally, MSCs can be induced to undergo apoptosis by cytotoxic cells in a perforin-dependent manner, thereby initiating the immunosuppressive effects of MSCs [235]. This suggests that pre-activation of MSCs in vitro can optimize their immunomodulatory effects following therapeutic infusion.",
        "Regarding the interaction between MSCs and neutrophils, research has mainly focused on regulating the survival and degranulation processes of neutrophils. In vitro studies have found that co-culture of MSCs and neutrophils can significantly prolong the lifespan of neutrophils, with IL-6 derived from MSCs being a key factor. IL-6 activates the STAT3 transcription factor, thereby extending the lifespan of neutrophils [236]. However, the specific mechanism of prolonging neutrophil lifespan in post-MI repair is not yet clear, as timely inhibition of the inflammatory response to promote fibrotic repair is a necessary process in post-MI repair. MSCs can also mediate the migration and adhesion of neutrophils. For example, MSCs can promote the expression of KYNA (a GPR35 ligand), which facilitates the adhesion of neutrophils to cells expressing ICAM-1 (such as endothelial and cardiomyocytes) [237]. Moreover, TGF-β1 expressed by MSCs has a strong chemotactic effect on neutrophils and monocytes and has been shown to inhibit the cytotoxicity of neutrophils [238].",
        "Studies have found that the release of neutrophil granules is significantly reduced in the presence of MSCs, which is considered an important action of MSCs against the inflammatory microenvironment. A key factor affecting the degranulation response of neutrophils is indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). IDO can inhibit the release of human neutrophil peptide 1–3 (HNP1-3, also known as α-defensin) [239]. α-defensins are a group of pro-inflammatory proteins stored in neutrophil granules that can induce the expression of adhesion molecules and co-stimulatory molecules, promote oxidative stress responses, and inhibit fibrinolysis and block angiogenesis [240]. Additionally, MSCs can inhibit both basal and N-Formyl-L-Methionyl-L-Leucyl-L-Phenylalanine (f-MLP)-induced respiratory burst, thereby reducing neutrophil damage to the myocardium [241]. When MSCs are pre-treated by activating TLR3 and TLR4, co-cultured neutrophils exhibit enhanced survival and bactericidal capacity in a simulated bacterial infection environment [236]. However, whether this phenomenon plays a role post-MI remains to be further explored.",
        "Macrophages are important immune cells in the inflammatory environment. Studies have found that when MSCs are co-cultured with macrophages, they primarily function by promoting the polarization of macrophages towards the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype [242], with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IDO, and MSC-derived IL-10 being proven to participate in this process and validated in a myocardial infarction mouse model. Sixteen weeks after MSC implantation, significant reductions in left ventricular remodeling and fractional shortening were observed in mice [243]. MSCs can also inhibit macrophages from producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-Ɣ, while increasing the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, a process mainly attributed to the mediation of PGE2 and TGF-β1 [244, 245]. In contrast, the enhancement of macrophage phagocytic activity by MSCs is less pronounced. Additionally, in the context of sepsis, the interaction between MSCs and macrophages involves two negative feedback regulatory loops. For example, TNF-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by resident macrophages can activate MSCs to secrete the anti-inflammatory mediator TNF-α stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6), which in turn can sequester the NF-κB signaling pathway in macrophages and inhibit the secretion of TNF-α by macrophages [244]. Lipopolysaccharide, TNF-α, NO, and DAMPs from damaged tissues and macrophages can stimulate MSCs to secrete PGE2, which can convert macrophages into a phenotype that secretes the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [242].",
        "In addition to the aforementioned cell types, most studies on the immunomodulatory capabilities of MSCs have focused on their interactions with T lymphocytes, likely due to the key role of T lymphocytes in graft-versus-host disease. Splenocytes were isolated from rats with MI and injected into healthy control rats after activation. Six weeks later, lymphocyte-mediated myocardial damage was observed in the recipient rats. In vitro experiments indicated that cytotoxic T cells were primarily responsible, causing significant damage to cardiomyocytes. However, the formation of these autoreactive lymphocytes was not immediate; when isolated 3 weeks post-MI, their cytotoxic effects were most pronounced [246]. In addition to cytotoxic T cells, an increase in the Th1 cell subset post-MI has been observed, which has been shown to activate cytotoxic T cells and produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby suppressing the production of protective Tregs and Th2 cell subsets [247]. Tregs are known to inhibit immune system activation and maintain tolerance to self-antigens, while Th2 cells are involved in humoral immunity, producing immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-4 [248]. This antigen-antibody reaction against healthy cardiomyocytes may influence long-term myocardial remodeling post-MI. Regarding the mechanisms by which MSCs inhibit T cells, studies have shown that IDO, PGE2, TGF-β1, and IL-10 are likely key players. For example, tryptophan depletion induced by IDO and the accumulation of metabolites (such as kynurenic acid [KYNA] and quinolinic acid) [237], as well as the mediation of PGE2, are considered key pathways for MSCs to inhibit T cell proliferation and promote Tregs formation [249]. MSCs can release TGF-β1 from the TGF-β1/glycoprotein-A repetitions predominant (GARP) complex to inhibit T cell activation [250]; they can also arrest T cells in the G0 phase to control T cell numbers [251]. MSCs can inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and negatively regulate the co-stimulatory molecule B7-H4 to block cell cycle progression [252]. Additionally, MSCs can block the proliferation and cytotoxicity of NK cells through cytokines such as IFN-Ɣ, TGF-β1, and PGE2 [253]. Meanwhile, IL-10 and TGF-β1 produced by MSCs promote the formation of Th2 cells and induce the formation of Tregs. It has also been found that IL-4 produced by Th2 cells can promote the formation of M2-type anti-inflammatory macrophages.",
        "The contributions of B cells, dendritic cells, and NK cells to the immune microenvironment post-MI are relatively less studied. The mechanism by which MSCs act on B cells primarily involves blocking cell cycle progression and regulating cell differentiation to control the harmful effects of B cells [254]. Additionally, MSCs can affect the chemotaxis of B cells towards CXCL12 and CXCL13, thereby blocking their migration to inflammatory areas [255]. For dendritic cells, it has been found that MSCs can significantly block their differentiation [169] and induce an immunotolerant phenotype through galectin-1-mediated MAPK signaling pathway stimulation [172]. PGE2 is also considered a key mediator for MSCs to target the function and maturation of dendritic cells. Studies have shown that when dendritic cells are co-cultured with MSCs, MSCs can reduce the homing of dendritic cells to lymphoid organs by downregulating CCR7 and integrin α4β1 (CD49 dβ1), thereby inhibiting T cell activation [170]. Moreover, MSCs have been found to inhibit the proliferation of resting NK cells, as well as the production of IFN-Ɣ and cytotoxicity, primarily by blocking activating receptors on the NK cell surface, such as natural cytotoxicity receptor 3 (NKp30), natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D), and NKp44 [171].",
        "The activation of inflammasomes has been demonstrated to play a role in the post-MI inflammatory environment. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly inhibit the expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and caspase-1 (components of the NLRP3 inflammasome) in the left ventricle of mice infected with coxsackievirus B3. This process is primarily mediated by stanniocalcin-1, an antioxidant protein secreted by MSCs, and offers a novel therapeutic strategy for viral myocarditis [256]. However, whether this mechanism operates similarly in the post-MI inflammatory environment remains to be further proven.",
        "Above all, stem cells exert fine-tuned regulation of the inflammatory microenvironment through a complex and diverse array of mechanisms that span multiple levels, from the cellular to the molecular (as shown in Fig. 2). First, stem cells can be activated by the inflammatory microenvironment, polarizing them towards an immunosuppressive phenotype and thereby enabling their immunomodulatory functions. Second, stem cells promote the recruitment and infiltration of immune cells to the site of inflammation by secreting a variety of chemokines and cytokines, thereby establishing an effective immunomodulatory microenvironment at the site of inflammation. Furthermore, stem cells induce functional changes in immune cells, inhibiting the signaling of pro-inflammatory cells, reducing the release of inflammatory cytokines, and promoting the formation of anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Additionally, stem cells can modulate the activation of inflammasomes, thereby reducing the intensity and duration of the inflammatory response. These mechanisms provide a solid theoretical foundation for optimizing the application of stem cell therapy in post-MI cardiac repair. However, despite existing research that has uncovered a variety of immunomodulatory functions of stem cells within the inflammatory microenvironment, the specific details of how these mechanisms operate in the post-MI context remain unclear and require further elucidation.",
        "Fig. 2Mechanisms of stem cell therapy in modulating the inflammatory microenvironment after MI. Stem cell therapy plays a crucial role in the inflammatory phase and proliferative phase following MI, modulating the dynamic changes of the inflammatory microenvironment. During the inflammatory phase, cytokines, chemokines, and ROS released by damaged myocardial tissue induce the chemotaxis and infiltration of leukocytes. Stem cells can be activated to promote the recruitment and infiltration of immune cells. In the fibrotic scar phase, stem cells primarily modulate the phenotypic transformation and functional changes of immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells, thereby inhibiting excessive inflammatory responses while promoting angiogenesis and vascular maturation.

        "Despite the new hope that stem cell therapy has brought to post-MI cardiac repair, poor cell implantation outcomes remain a major challenge limiting its clinical application. This section will focus on the impact of the host fibrotic environment on stem cell implantation, discuss new findings on the potential interactions between host myocardial fibroblasts, ECM, and implanted cardiomyocytes, and explore the possible feedback loop between cardiac fibrosis and cell implantation.",
        "As previously described, fibroblasts and ECM dynamics play a key role in myocardial remodeling during the healing process following MI and also significantly affect the fate of transplanted cells. Current understanding of the impact of fibrotic myocardial tissue post-MI on transplanted stem cells is largely based on speculative and descriptive studies of post-MI tissue composition changes, mainly reflected in the following aspects: early inflammatory responses induce an inflammatory cell phenotype in transplanted cells, compromising their survival [257]; activation of myofibroblasts interferes with the electrical coupling of transplanted cells; a stiff matrix hinders cell migration and contractile function; scar tissue alters cardiomyocyte contractility through mechanical signaling, and supramolecular fiber structures impair tissue vascularization. These factors collectively limit the integration and functional performance of transplanted cells in fibrotic myocardium.",
        "Myofibroblasts are the primary cell type during the fibroproliferative phase following MI, possessing characteristics of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. However, unlike the electrically stimulated contraction of cardiomyocytes (which maintains cardiac rhythmic beating), the contraction of myofibroblasts primarily relies on mechanical forces for tissue repair and remodeling. There are significant differences between the two in terms of molecular markers, tissue environment, and regulatory mechanisms [26]. This difference leads to the contractile forces generated by myofibroblasts being transmitted to the cardiomyocyte membrane and activating mechanosensitive channels, which may subsequently impair the electrophysiological function of cardiomyocytes. Moreover, the α-SMA microfilaments expressed in myofibroblasts can promote the generation of abnormal automaticity and impulse conduction, affecting the electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytes and enhancing the propensity for arrhythmias through gap junctions [258]. It is thus inferred that myofibroblasts may interfere with the electrical coupling between PSC-derived cardiomyocytes transplanted into the infarcted heart. Some studies to date support this hypothesis. For instance, a study using a 3D cardiac tissue slice model derived from hiPSCs to simulate torsade de pointes (TdP)-like tachycardia in vitro showed that when treated with a potassium ion channel (IKr) blocker, the cardiac tissue exhibited rapid arrhythmias with typical TdP features, and these abnormal waveforms were mainly observed in mixtures of cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes (fibroblasts) [259]. Additionally, it was found that implantation of hMSCs themselves may cause depolarization-induced conduction slowing through heterocellular coupling and directly release paracrine factors that affect repolarization rates, thereby inducing arrhythmias in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes [260]. Notably, there are differences in the distribution and density of myofibroblasts (Mfbs) in the infarcted and peri-infarct regions following MI. At moderate densities (0–30% of Mfbs forming gap junctions), Mfbs can shorten cell action potentials and exacerbate the propensity for arrhythmia formation; whereas at high densities (80% of Mfbs forming gap junctions), Mfbs can counteract arrhythmias by causing resting depolarization and blocking conduction [261]. Moreover, the adverse electrophysiological consequences following cell therapy may be related to the ratio of myofibroblasts to implanted cells in the tissue. For example, compared to small animal models (rodents), non-lethal ventricular arrhythmias were observed in primate models transplanted with hESC-CMs, which may be attributed to spontaneously formed reentrant circuits in the animal’s myocardial tissue [220]. However, current research on the impact of the post-MI fibrotic environment on implanted cells remains very limited. Future studies should also consider exploring the effects of using stem cells from different sources, altering cell doses, or changing implantation methods at different stages post-MI on the efficacy of stem cell therapy, in order to optimize the application of stem cell therapy in the post-MI microenvironment.",
        "Following MI, excessive collagen deposition significantly increases the stiffness of myocardial tissue (from 10 kPa in a normal adult heart to over 100 kPa in fibrotic tissue), which may contribute to diastolic and systolic dysfunction post-MI [262]. In vitro studies have shown that high-density collagen (≥ 6 mg/mL) restricts the formation of electrical coupling, cellular maturation, and tissue contractility in hESC-CMs lacking cell-to-cell contact, thereby significantly limiting cardiomyocyte function [263]. Moreover, research encapsulating hiPSC-CMs in chemically crosslinked gelatin hydrogels (1.25 × 108/mL) has found that compared to cells in high-stiffness (16 kPa)/slow-degrading hydrogels, hiPSC-CMs in low-stiffness (2 kPa)/fast-degrading and medium-stiffness (9 kPa)/moderately degradable hydrogels can form significant intercellular networks, significantly express α-actinin and Cx43, and exhibit enhanced contractility [264]. These studies highlight the importance of physiological collagen density and matrix stiffness in the formation of stem cell-derived myocardial tissue.",
        "As previously mentioned, the ECM affects cardiomyocyte contractile activity through molecular mechanosensors and mechanotransducers such as integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. However, studies have found that force generation or contractility induced by non-muscle myosin also plays an important role in the mechanical sensing of cardiomyocytes. Non-muscle myosin is a motor protein that primarily participates in mechanotransduction by regulating the tension between cells and the matrix. In a MI mouse model, PKC and non-muscle myosin activity are significantly upregulated at the integrin adhesion sites of cardiomyocytes, which allows the increased matrix stiffness due to tissue fibrosis and mechanical tension to be transmitted to cardiomyocytes, leading to abnormal mechanical sensing in cardiomyocytes and thereby promoting cardiac remodeling and even heart failure [265]. As the scaffold for transplanted cell attachment, whether the increase in in vivo tissue stiffness post-MI affects cell penetration, migration, and interaction remains unclear and requires further research to elucidate the impact of scar tissue on stem cell implantation and therapeutic effects.",
        "Transplanted cardiomyocyte tissue derived from implanted cells requires vascularization to provide adequate nutrition and oxygen supply. However, scar formation in ischemic areas can affect the heart’s angiogenic capacity [266]. The process of blood vessel formation, including the proliferation, migration, and sprouting of vascular cells, may be reshaped by the dynamic changes in the ECM during myocardial fibrosis. Additionally, the excessive accumulation of crosslinked type I collagen copolymers may form a physical barrier that hinders the migration of transplanted cells or restricts the infiltration of host-derived microvessels. Fibrotic tissue also expresses a variety of anti-angiogenic or pro-apoptotic factors, such as Ang-II and TGF-β1, which limit blood vessel formation [267]. These factors collectively significantly impact the vascularization capacity of scar tissue for implanted stem cells post-MI.",
        "Myocardial injury leads to the loss of contractile myocardial tissue, which is typically irreversible in the absence of effective regeneration. Cell-based therapies have been shown to repair scarred myocardial tissue and reduce scar size, a conclusion that has been validated in multiple clinical studies.",
        "Experimental studies have shown that injection of BMSCs near the infarct site significantly reduces cardiac fibrosis. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that the conditioned medium of BMSCs can reduce collagen production by cardiac fibroblasts and decrease their responsiveness to TGF-β stimulation. It has been found that the expression of TGF-β neutralizing proteoglycan biglycan and IGF-1 in the culture medium is significantly increased, with biglycan possessing high antifibrotic activity and IGF-1 having anti-apoptotic effects [268, 269]. Moreover, following the transplantation of BMSCs, the expression of pro-fibrotic molecules (such as miR-21 and miR-155) in the infarcted myocardium is significantly reduced [270].",
        "The therapeutic potential of MSCs in the damaged heart has been confirmed in numerous studies. Implanted MSCs promote collagen degradation in scar tissue through paracrine effects, such as the expression of cytokines and MMPs. For example, in a rat MI model, following MSCs transplantation, the mRNA and protein expression of type I collagen, type III collagen, TIMP-1/2, and TGF-β1 in the tissue were significantly reduced, while left ventricular systolic pressure and left ventricular systolic and diastolic peak velocities were significantly increased [271, 272]. Additionally, MSCs can inhibit fibroblast activation and proliferation, reduce collagen deposition, and regulate the synthesis of MMPs and their inhibitors. For instance, MSCs can inhibit the activation of cardiac fibroblasts induced by hypoxia, with leptin knockout playing a key role [271]. Some genes that inhibit cell proliferation in the conditioned medium of BMSCs, such as elastin and DNA damage-inducible transcript 3, are upregulated [273]. MSCs can also alleviate myocardial fibrosis by secreting antifibrotic factors (such as adrenomedullin [ADM]), with ADM-overexpressing MSCs showing reduced MMP2 levels and improved cardiac function [274]. Moreover, HGF secreted by MSCs can inhibit the pro-fibrotic effects of miR-155 [270]. Inhibiting nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) in MSCs via siRNA can reduce collagen deposition in the infarct area and decrease myocardial cell regeneration post-MI [275]. In addition to their effects on the ECM, MSCs also possess immunomodulatory functions, as evidenced by their interactions with cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses (as previously described). Since chronic inflammation is an important driving force in the development of cardiac fibrosis, the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs may be intertwined with their antifibrotic actions.",
        "In addition to the aforementioned two major categories of stem cells, other cell types such as ESCs, skeletal muscle fibroblasts (SMBs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and pericytes (PCs) have also been found to possess antifibrotic potential. A summary of the antifibrotic effects of these cells is presented in Table 2.",

        "Endogenous cardiac stem cells (i.e., cardiac progenitor cells, CPCs) have also been shown to improve the fibrotic environment, primarily through the following two mechanisms: (1) promoting the degradation of ECM in myocardial scars; and (2) promoting ventricular wall thickening and tissue vascularization. For example, it has been found that CPCs recruited by local stimulation can secrete collagen-degrading enzymes such as MMP2/9/14, while inhibiting the expression of TIMP-4, thereby reducing the adverse effects of scar tissue [282]. Co-transplantation of CPCs with EPDCs or MSCs can produce synergistic effects, further reducing the size of infarcted tissue. It has also been found that changes in the cellular secretome, such as significant increases in the expression of VEGF-A, placental growth factor (PLGF), and PDGF-BB, contribute to improved cardiac function and reduced left ventricular remodeling [283]. Further exploration of the important signaling pathways involved in these cells will provide new insights into stem cell antifibrosis.",
        "Despite encouraging results with stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in animal studies, the translation of these findings to clinical applications still faces numerous challenges, including low graft survival rates, poor functional integration, and suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. In addition to optimizing the characteristics of the transplanted cells themselves, modulating the target of cell therapy—the fibrotic environment—to enhance functional integration between cells and tissues is equally crucial.",
        "The combination of stem cell-based regenerative medicine and pharmacological therapy is considered a promising strategy for replacing lost myocardium and restoring cardiac function. Pharmacological interventions aimed at inhibiting or reversing fibrosis and its adverse outcomes have been widely applied in the treatment of heart disease, such as ACE inhibitors and statins [284]. Statins possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce leukocyte infiltration in infarcted myocardium, thereby protecting the endothelial barrier and inhibiting the transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts [285–287]. Studies have shown that pre-treatment with statins in MI models can reduce cell apoptosis and enhance the migration and survival of implanted stem cells by activating signaling pathways such as SDF-1α/CXCR4 [288, 289]. Moreover, simvastatin treatment has been proven to enhance cardiac-related gene expression and cardiomyogenesis in ESCs [287]. In addition to statins, whether other antifibrotic drugs similarly enhance the effects of stem cell therapy requires further investigation.",
        "Studies have shown that targeting genes involved in the regulation of matricellular protein expression and matrix remodeling may help reduce scar barriers in the vicinity of cell injection, thereby improving the survival and functional integration of implanted cells in infarcted myocardium. Adenylyl cyclase-6 (AC6) is an early and effective target in this direction, which can target the TGF-β pathway, inhibit fibroblast activation and collagen synthesis, and thereby promote cardiac function improvement following cell implantation in mice [290]. In addition, overexpression of miR-29 has been shown to significantly enhance the migration and vascularization of iPSC-derived cells in implanted cell sheets within infarcted myocardium [291], a finding that has been preliminarily validated in a Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02603224). However, this combination of gene therapy and stem cells still requires further research in terms of appropriate delivery vehicles, tissue targeting specificity, and recipient immune responses.",
        "In summary, implanted stem cells are believed to reduce cardiac fibrosis, and reducing scar formation will allow enhanced cell migration and implantation, ultimately establishing a positive feedback loop (as shown in Fig. 3) to promote re-myogenesis in the infarcted heart, which is the best expectation. It should be noted that although stem cell therapy has the potential to reduce fibrosis, the adverse effects of fibrotic tissue on implanted stem cells greatly limit the efficacy of cell therapy. Therefore, developing and optimizing stem cell therapy strategies that improve the fibrotic microenvironment is of great significance.",

        "Tissue repair following MI involves a robust angiogenic response, which is crucial for reducing scar formation and improving adverse left ventricular remodeling. During embryonic development, blood vessel formation begins with the assembly of mesoderm-derived endothelial precursor cells, which differentiate to form primitive vascular plexi. Subsequently, endothelial cells sprout to form a microvascular network, which is remodeled to form a complete vascular tree [292]. Post-MI, the formation of a new microvascular network within the tissue is primarily achieved through sprouting angiogenesis from pre-existing endothelial cells in the infarct border zone, with this process involving a gradual extension from the border zone towards the center of the infarct [109]. Stem cells, as therapeutic cells with multidifferentiation potential, show broad application prospects in the treatment of MI-related tissue ischemia. Studies have shown that bone marrow-derived stem cells, pluripotent stem cells, and progenitor cells can promote angiogenesis and restore tissue function, thereby playing an important role in improving cardiac function post-MI.",
        "In the treatment of MI, stem cells mainly participate in angiogenesis to repair tissue ischemia by releasing pro-angiogenic factors and/or differentiating into vascular cell lineages. For example, EPCs and MNCs can differentiate into the endothelial cell lineage, thereby participating in the formation of new blood vessels. EPCs are derived from CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and co-express CD34, CD133, and KDR. Studies have shown that EPCs can be mobilized to the circulation to participate in angiogenesis and promote endothelial repair following tissue injury [293]. During vascular injury, tissues release large amounts of VEGF, which not only mobilizes bone marrow-derived cells to home to ischemic organs but also induces the production of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). SDF-1 can maintain the homing of circulating bone marrow cells and promote angiogenesis [294]. Kamihata et al. transplanted CD34+ BM-MNCs into ischemic myocardium in pigs and found increased local blood flow and capillary density, with BM-MNCs being incorporated into over 30% of the newly formed capillaries. Additionally, pro-angiogenic ligands and cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF-α, were detected in the tissue [295].",
        "PSCs mainly promote angiogenesis by differentiating into the endothelial cell lineage and functionally integrating into blood vessels and surrounding tissues. Studies have shown that injection of allogeneic VE-cadherin-positive ESC-ECs into the peri-infarct region of mice significantly increased capillary density in the infarct area [295]. iPSC-ECs have been shown to express endothelial cell markers, including CD31, CD144, VEGFR2 (KDR), and Von Willebrand factor [296], and to possess endothelial cell functions to some extent, such as forming tube-like structures on 3D matrices and chemotactic migration in response to VEGF [297]. In vitro experiments further confirmed that iPSC-ECs can form functionally intact vascular networks together with mesenchymal precursor cells and pericytes [298]. Lee et al. injected differentiated canine iPSC-ECs into a mouse model of MI, and the results showed significant improvement in myocardial contractility in mice, with reporter gene-positive iPSC-ECs still detectable 42 days after administration [299]. Gu et al. generated iPSC-ECs from porcine iPSCs and transplanted them into a mouse model of MI, and mechanistic studies found that iPSC-ECs may promote angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte survival by releasing various pro-angiogenic factors (such as VEGF-1 and angiopoietin) and anti-apoptotic factors, thereby improving cardiac ejection fraction [300].",
        "MSCs have relatively limited differentiation capacity, and although they can differentiate into the endothelial cell lineage or express endothelial lineage markers, their main role in angiogenesis is achieved through paracrine mechanisms. Studies have shown that after transplantation of a cell sheet composed of MSCs onto the epicardium of infarcted rats, a thick layer structure containing new blood vessels, undifferentiated cells, and a small number of cardiomyocytes was formed at the implantation site. The transplanted cell sheet enhanced angiogenesis through paracrine signaling, reversed ventricular wall thinning, and significantly improved cardiac function [301]. In vitro studies further indicated that the conditioned medium of MSCs can promote capillary lumen formation by increasing sprouting, chemotaxis, and endothelial cell proliferation [302]. The recognized effective soluble cytokines mainly include the VEGF superfamily, bFGF, HGF, IGF-1, and MCP-1. Implantation of MSCs has been shown to lead to increased secretion of VEGF [303], which induces angiogenesis post-AMI by activating the ROS-endoplasmic reticulum stress-autophagy axis in vascular endothelial cells [304]. As a member of the VEGF superfamily, PLGF also plays an important role in MSC-mediated angiogenesis and can recruit more MSCs to ischemic sites through macrophage polarization, forming a positive feedback loop [305]. bFGF mainly acts by enhancing the proliferation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells [306], although validation in tumor cells suggests that the AKT/HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway may be activated [307], its specific mechanism of action in ischemic myocardium still requires further exploration. HGF secreted by MSCs has been shown to protect endothelial barrier function by increasing the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules through Rac family small GTPase 1 (Rac1) [308]. In animal models of MI, MSCs transfected with HGF were also found to reduce infarct size, increase cell survival, and reduce collagen deposition [309], but the specific mechanisms are not yet clear. IGF-1 is mainly secreted by adipose-derived MSCs [310], and its overexpression has been shown to promote angiogenesis by activating the PI3 K/AKT pathway [311], and improve microcirculation perfusion and LVEF [312]. MCP-1 is a key chemokine that stimulates the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and MSCs [115], and it can mediate the activation of endothelial cell cadherin-12 and cadherin-19 gene expression by the transcription factor MAP-1 induced protein (MCPIP) [313].",
        "Similarly, in light of the low survival rate of MSCs following transplantation, researchers have explored various methods to enhance MSC-mediated angiogenesis, including pharmacological preconditioning, coculture or cotransplantation with supportive cells, physical stimulation, tissue engineering, and genetic modification. MSCs preconditioned with atorvastatin (ATV) have been shown to increase the expression of VEGF and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, thereby enhancing endothelial cell function [314]. Moreover, pharmacological treatment can upregulate the expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 on the surface of MSCs, mediating their migration to damaged myocardium through interaction with SDF-1 [315]. The improvement of cell therapy by ATV preconditioning has also entered clinical trial stages. Regarding cytokines, Angiotensin II (Ang II) preconditioning of MSCs has been shown to enhance VEGF expression [316]. Cotreatment of MSCs with IL-1 and TGF-β1 can promote the formation of the ATF2-SP1-SMAD3 transcriptional complex, inducing activation and further synthesis of VEGF at the promoter site [317].",
        "Interactions between supportive cells and MSCs can regulate angiogenesis through paracrine effects and cell-to-cell contact. On one hand, using supportive cells that cannot directly differentiate into endothelial cells can serve as an auxiliary means to enhance the reparative effects of MSCs. For example, coculture with BM-MSCs can promote the shift of macrophage phenotype towards the M2 type, which, through the production of anti-inflammatory factors, synergistically promotes angiogenesis [318]. On the other hand, both MSCs and supportive cells can differentiate into endothelial cells or respectively lead to neovascularization. For instance, MSCs cocultured with BM-EPCs can express vascular markers beyond those expressed in separate cultures, while EPCs can stimulate MSCs proliferation, and in turn, MSCs can enhance EPC survival [319]. Hypoxia preconditioning has been proven to be a powerful stimulus for enhancing the pro-angiogenic effects of MSCs, mainly due to the upregulation of HIF-1α and its target genes (such as VEGF, glucose transporter 1, and lactate dehydrogenase A), as well as the enhanced anti-apoptotic capacity of MSCs [320]. The application of tissue engineering tools such as biohydrogels, adhesive microdroplets, and cell patches supports the retention, survival, and secretion of pro-angiogenic factors of MSCs after transplantation through encapsulation and cross-linking actions [321]. Genetic modification can more directly regulate the paracrine effects of MSCs to maximize their pro-angiogenic effects. In addition to the cytokines mentioned above produced by MSCs, overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes (such as Bcl-2-like protein 1 [BCL2-like protein 1, BCL-XL]) [322] and chemokines (such as SDF-1α) [323] has also been shown to promote angiogenesis and has been verified in both in vitro and in vivo experiments.",
        "These data collectively demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of improving ischemic myocardium through the transplantation of stem cells and progenitor cells in preclinical animal models. However, current research still has some limitations. For example, the use of immunodeficient animal models or immunosuppressive treatment of transplanted human cells may result in a lack of functional immune response, thus failing to fully simulate the physiological environment within the human body. Moreover, it is difficult to clearly distinguish the specific mechanisms by which stem cells promote myocardial tissue regeneration or improve cardiac function in both in vitro and in vivo studies (as shown in Fig. 4), that is, whether it is achieved through promoting angiogenesis or directly promoting cardiomyocyte regeneration. Despite these limitations, these studies still provide encouraging results. The ability of stem cells to secrete a variety of pro-angiogenic factors and their potential to integrate into the vascular system are the most direct means of promoting angiogenesis.",
        "Fig. 4Mechanisms of stem cell therapy in promoting angiogenesis Post-MI. In the treatment of MI, stem cells mainly promote angiogenesis and repair tissue ischemia through two pathways. On one hand, stem cells can differentiate into vascular cell lineages, such as endothelial cells, to directly participate in the construction of new blood vessels. On the other hand, stem cells can secrete a variety of pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, HGF, PLGF, MCP1, and IGF-1, which can work together to stimulate endogenous angiogenesis and improve local blood flow perfusion",

        "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized, membrane-bound vesicles released by cells, capable of transporting bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. They significantly influence the gene expression and cellular behavior of terget cells, thereby playing a crucial role in cell-to-cell communication [324]. For stem cells such as MSCs, EVs are indispensable in assisting functional components (such as miRNAs and proteins) to cross the cell membrane. An increasing number of studies have proven that the cardioprotective effects of stem cells mainly originate from their paracrine effects, rather than direct cardiomyocyte regeneration. In the context of MI, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), as a cell-free therapy, are considered a safer alternative to virus-mediated transgenic reprogramming due to their low immunogenicity and minimal risk of immune rejection. In body fluids, EVs are mainly divided into sEVs, apoptotic bodies (ABs), and large extracellular vesicles (lEVs) [324]. Although previous reviews have comprehensively summarized the role of stem cell-derived sEVs in post-MI cardiac repair, most studies have focused on the phenotypic and functional descriptions of target cells/tissues. This section will delve into the specific mechanisms and related signaling pathways by which stem cell-derived sEVs promote angiogenesis, regulate inflammation, resist fibrosis, and induce cardiomyocyte regeneration.",
        "In the angiogenesis following MI, studies have shown that sEVs play a key role by transferring pro-angiogenic miRNAs, paracrine factors that promote angiogenesis, and inducing autophagy in endothelial cells, which may involve signaling pathways such as Notch, MAPK, NF-κB, and PI3 K/Akt.",
        "Delta-like 4 (DLL4), a membrane-bound ligand of the Notch signaling family, plays a crucial role in angiogenesis. In vitro experiments have shown that sEVs derived from MSCs can promote the formation of tube-like structures in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), while in vivo experiments have shown that they can mobilize endothelial cells into Matrigel plug, thereby promoting angiogenesis. This may be attributed to the secretion of miR-30 family members by MSC-derived sEVs [302]. Further zebrafish embryo experiments have found that miR-30b can inhibit the expression of Dll4 by targeting it, leading to excessive vascular sprouting and accelerated angiogenesis. In addition, loss-of-function experiments have shown that the absence of miR-30 can significantly inhibit the pro-angiogenic ability of MSC-derived sEVs [325]. Studies have found that sEVs derived from MSCs overexpressing HIF-1α (HIF-MSC-Exos) can significantly increase proteins related to the Notch signaling pathway, with the highest content of Jagged1 (a Notch ligand), which is also the only Notch ligand packaged into sEVs. Further in vivo and in vitro experiments have found that inhibiting Jagged1 can block HIF-MSC-Exos-induced angiogenesis [326]. This proves that the activation of the Notch signaling pathway induced by HIF-1α is the main mechanism of its pro-angiogenic effect.",
        "VEGF and FGF are two of the most potent pro-angiogenic factors, which promote angiogenesis by activating the MAPK pathway. MiR-126 secreted by MSC-derived sEVs has been shown to regulate this pathway and affect angiogenesis. Studies have found that overexpression of miR-126 can significantly enhance FGF-2-induced ERK1/2 (MAPK) phosphorylation, while knockdown of miR-126 has the opposite effect [327]. Huang et al. have proven that preconditioning with ATV can similarly enhance the positive effect on this pathway. Their study found that the expression of lncRNA-H19 in MSC-ATV-Exos was significantly increased, and the miR-675-3p and miR-675-5p encoded by the latter were also increased in co-cultured endothelial cells [314]. Under hypoxic conditions, overexpression of miR-675-5p can further enhance the level of HIF-1α, which, as the main transcription factor of VEGF, promotes the expression of VEGF and, in synergy with ICAM-1, promotes angiogenesis, showing advantages in improving cardiac function and reducing infarct size in a rat model of MI [328]. In addition, increased activity of Ras protein can also activate the expression of downstream MAPK (such as ERK1/2), thereby promoting endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Studies have found that miR-132 secreted by MSC-derived sEVs can activate the Ras-MAPK pathway by inhibiting the expression of RASA1 (a Ras GTPase-activating protein), thereby promoting angiogenesis in a mouse model of myocardial infarction [329].",
        "By simulating peripheral artery disease (an ischemia-related condition) and conducting proteomics analysis, studies have identified 1,937 proteins in sEVs derived from MSCs, recognizing pro-angiogenic molecules such as PDGF, epithelial growth factor (EGF), FGF, and NF-κB. This indicates that sEVs derived from MSCs can also secrete potential angiogenic paracrine factors. Among them, in vitro experiments have shown that the NF-κB inhibitor (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, PDTC) can significantly inhibit the tube formation capacity of sEVs, indicating that the NF-κB signaling pathway is a key mediator of MSC sEVs-induced angiogenesis [330]. It is thus inferred that sEVs derived from MSCs post-MI may exert similar effects, although the molecules affected in the pathway still require further investigation.",
        "The PI3 K/Akt signaling pathway is primarily involved in cell survival, proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenesis. The activation of the downstream protein eNOS can increase NO production, thereby promoting vasodilation and angiogenesis. Studies have found that sEVs derived from MSCs overexpressing miR-126 can significantly enhance the levels of p-Akt/Akt and p-eNOS, and promote the proliferation, migration, and tube formation capacity of endothelial cells damaged by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), while the PI3 K inhibitor (LY294002) can inhibit these effects [331]. This indicates that the PI3 K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway is involved in the protective effects of MSC-EXs on H/R-damaged endothelial cells. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a negative regulator of the PI3 K/Akt signaling pathway, which inhibits Akt activation by dephosphorylating PIP3 and reducing its levels. Compared to BM-MSCs and ADMSCs, sEVs secreted by endometrial mesenchymal stem cells (EnMSCs) highly express miR-21, which has been proven to target PTEN to activate the Akt signaling pathway, and increased expression of VEGF has been observed in co-cultured endothelial cells, thereby promoting angiogenesis. Additionally, increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreased expression of apoptosis-related proteins Bax and caspase-3 have been observed in co-cultured cardiomyocytes [332], demonstrating the anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic effects of the miR-21/PTEN/Akt axis in infarcted myocardium.",
        "In addition to the aforementioned signaling pathways, studies have found that sEVs derived from MSCs may also enhance angiogenesis by promoting autophagy in endothelial cells. It has been observed that a large number of MSCs undergo apoptosis shortly after transplantation, which seems to contradict the therapeutic effects ultimately produced. Further analysis revealed that ABs released during MSCs apoptosis may play an important role. It was observed that ABs released by MSCs were phagocytosed by endothelial cells, activating their lysosomal function and promoting the expression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), thereby significantly enhancing autophagy. Importantly, ABs also upregulated pro-angiogenic genes (such as ANGPT1 and KDR) in endothelial cells, while downregulating anti-angiogenic genes (such as THBS1 and vascular endothelial specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 [VASH1]). Ultimately, increased angiogenesis in the infarct border zone of rats, reduced infarct size, and significant improvement in cardiac function were observed [333]. This also illustrates the role of ABs, one of the components of sEVs, in promoting angiogenesis.",
        "Following MI, myocardial ischemia and necrosis activate various cell death mechanisms, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necrocytosis. sEVs derived from stem cells have been shown to induce cardiomyocyte protection by modulating these biological behaviors.",
        "MiR-21a-5p is a typical exosomal miRNA secreted by BMMSCs, which significantly reduces cardiomyocyte death induced under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. Studies have found that miR-21a-5p significantly downregulates the expression of pro-apoptotic genes such as PTEN, programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), pelikan homolog 1 (Peli1), and Fas ligand (Fasl). Among them, miR-21a-5p promotes Akt activation by degrading PTEN protein, thereby reducing its dephosphorylation of PIP3. Additionally, miR-21a-5p inhibits apoptosis by reducing Fasl expression, preventing its binding to the Fas receptor, and decreasing caspase 8 activation. miR-21a-5p also inhibits NF-κB activation by targeting Peli1, reducing inflammation and apoptosis. PDCD4 is another target gene of miR-21a-5p, and miR-21a-5p reduces its protein expression level by targeting the 3’UTR of PDCD4, thereby inhibiting its pro-apoptotic effect [334]. sEVs derived from BMMSCs have also been shown to carry the E3 ubiquitin ligase (ITCH), which inhibits the expression of apoptosis signal-regulated kinase-1 (ASK1) through ubiquitination, thereby reducing apoptosis induced in cardiomyocytes under hypoxia [335]. ASK1 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase that is sensitive to oxidative stress and can further regulate cell death through the activation of p38-MAPK and JNK signaling pathways. GSK3β is also a key molecule in promoting apoptosis, and studies have found that hypoxia treatment increases the expression of miRNA-26a in MSC-Exos, which inhibits the expression of GSK3β and phosphorylated β-catenin (a mediator of the Wnt pro-apoptotic pathway), reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury to cardiomyocytes and infarct size [336]. CXCR4 is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds to SDF-1α and plays a key role in stem cell homing, migration, and survival. Studies have found that sEVs (ExoCR4) isolated from MSCs overexpressing CXCR4 under hypoxic conditions significantly reduce the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes. This effect is achieved through the activation of the PI3 K/Akt pathway, characterized by upregulation of IGF-1 and pAkt levels in cardiomyocytes and downregulation of active caspase 3 levels. Additionally, ExoCR4 has been found to enhance the tube formation capacity of HUVECs in vitro, which is associated with upregulation of VEGF and can be inhibited by PI3 K inhibitors [337]. MiR-19a secreted by sEVs derived from hucMSCs has been shown to activate the AKT pathway and inhibit the activation of the JNK3/caspase-3 pathway by targeting and reducing the expression of SOX6. Caspase-3 is the execution protein of apoptosis, and its activation marks the irreversible stage of apoptosis. Studies have found that caspase-3/cleaved caspase-3 levels are significantly reduced under the action of miR-19a, indicating that miR-19a targets the AKT/JNK3/caspase-3 pathway to reduce apoptosis and protect cardiomyocytes from ischemic injury [338]. Circular RNAs secreted by sEVs derived from MSCs have also been shown to improve myocardial injury by affecting apoptotic pathways. Studies have found that circRNA_0002113 secreted by sEVs derived from BMMSCs acts as a “sponge” to adsorb miR-188-3p, which inhibits the expression of the RUNX1 gene by targeting its 3’UTR. RUNX1 is a transcription factor whose nuclear translocation is closely related to apoptosis. Studies have found that under the action of circRNA_0002113, the expression of the downstream deubiquitinase USP7 and p53 and BAX of RUNX1 is significantly reduced, the infarct size in rats with MI is significantly reduced, and serum cTnT levels are decreased [339]. This indicates that the circRNA_0002113/miR-188-3p/RUNX axis plays an important role in post-MI repair by affecting the USP7/p53 pathway.",
        "sEVs derived from MSCs can inhibit molecules related to pyroptosis, thereby reducing cardiomyocyte death in infarcted rats. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death characterized by the disruption of cell integrity and the release of inflammatory cytokines. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) KLF-AS1 has been shown to be significantly expressed in MSCs-Exs. lncRNAs can influence gene expression through multiple processes, including transcriptional regulation (such as binding to promoter regions), post-transcriptional regulation (such as affecting mRNA stability), and epigenetic regulation (such as recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes). Studies have found that KLF-AS1 significantly inhibits the expression of pyroptosis-related factors in cardiomyocytes (such as NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and gasdermin D [GSDMD]) and inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. It achieves this by acting as a molecular sponge for miR-138-5p, which in turn targets the silencing information regulator 2-related enzyme 1 (Sirt1), ultimately reducing the infarct size in rats [340]. NLRP3 induces the formation of mature caspase-1 and the activation of IL-1β and IL-18, which can create a pro-pyroptotic microenvironment. It has been found that miR-100-5p secreted by sEVs derived from hucMSCs can target and bind to FOXO3, an upstream molecule of NRLP3, thereby inhibiting the formation of the pyroptosis microenvironment and protecting cardiomyocytes from pyroptosis under hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) conditions [341].",
        "Recent studies have found that ferroptosis and copper overload may also contribute to cardiomyocyte death following MI. miR-23a-3p secreted by sEVs derived from hucMSCs has been shown to potentially target divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), thereby regulating cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and alleviating myocardial injury [342]. In addition, genes related to copper overload and ferroptosis (cuproptosis- and ferroptosis-related genes, CFRGs) have been identified in infarcted tissue, proving that they may be involved in post-MI tissue remodeling [343]. Further research is needed to elucidate the possible signaling pathways and sEVs-carrying molecules with targeting effects.",
        "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial damage represent the subcellular manifestations of cardiomyocyte death following MI. ER stress is characterized by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in cardiomyocytes, which can lead to apoptosis and tissue fibrosis [344]. It has been found that sEVs derived from hucMSCs can respond to ER stress-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes through the PI3 K/Akt signaling pathway, with significant reductions in the levels of apoptosis-related proteins such as Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 [345]. The significantly upregulated oxidative stress response post-MI and excessive ROS exacerbate mitochondrial homeostasis and mitochondrial DNA damage, potentially leading to more extensive and severe cardiomyocyte injury [346]. sEVs derived from MSCs have been found to protect mitochondrial function and reduce apoptosis. It has been discovered that sEVs derived from BMMSCs overexpressing macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) can reduce ROS levels in infarcted rats and inhibit excessive mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in damaged cardiomyocytes. Further mechanistic studies have found that MIF-BMMSC-exos exert cardioprotective effects by activating AMPK [347]. sEVs derived from BMSCs co-cultured with CSCs have been shown to alleviate oxidative stress-related damage in CSCs by carrying miR-124 and inhibiting the expression of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) [348]. CaMKII can activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, enhance the oxidative stress response, increase membrane permeability, release cytochrome c, and induce apoptosis [349].",
        "In addition to inhibiting cardiomyocyte injury, sEVs derived from stem cells have also been shown to induce the transdifferentiation of non-cardiomyocytes, promoting cardiomyocyte regeneration and thereby improving myocardial remodeling, a process known as “direct lineage conversion”. Studies have demonstrated that by co-culturing mouse embryonic fibroblasts with sEVs isolated from the embryoid body formation stage (Emb-EVs) and the mesoderm induction stage (Mes-EVs), fibroblasts began to contract spontaneously from day 12 and formed cell clusters resembling cardiomyocytes, characterized by the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific markers (α-actinin, α-MHC, cTnT, etc.) and the appearance of sarcomeric structures. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the miR-290 family, which is enriched in Emb-EVs and associated with pluripotency and early differentiation, may initiate the reprogramming process of fibroblasts, while the highly expressed miR-1 and miR-133 in Mes-EVs play key roles in cardiomyocyte differentiation and maturation. Moreover, when these sEVs were injected into a mouse model of MI, sEVs treatment significantly reduced infarct size and improved mouse cardiac function [350]. Further elucidation revealed that when co-cultured with sEVs secreted by epicardial adipose tissue-derived stem cells (EATDS), porcine fibroblasts showed significant upregulation of key transcription factors promoting cardiomyocyte differentiation and maturation, such as GATA4, Nkx2.5, iroquois homeobox protein (IRX4), and TBX5, indicating that fibroblasts were undergoing a reprogramming process. Although the key molecules in sEVs promoting this transdifferentiation process were not identified, the study used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify a subpopulation of EATDS with great healing potential, which was shown to secrete molecules such as Galectin-1 (regulating immune responses and cell cycle), Peroxiredoxin 2 (encoding antioxidant enzymes), and CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein) to construct a microenvironment conducive to myocardial repair [351]. These findings also provide important evidence for the clinical translation of sEVs.",
        "In MI, TLR4 serves as a key mediator of pro-inflammatory signaling, and its activation triggers inflammatory responses that exacerbate myocardial injury. Studies have shown that sEVs derived from MSCs highly express miR-182-5p, which targets TLR4, significantly reducing its mRNA and protein expression levels and further decreasing the phosphorylation level of p65, a marker of NF-κB signaling pathway activation. sEVs overexpressing miR-182-5p can significantly inhibit the expression of inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MCP-1) in myocardial tissue and significantly improve cardiac function, characterized by reduced left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), as well as increased LVEF and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) [352]. Additionally, miR-129-5p expressed by MSC-derived sEVs has been shown to target HMGB1, inhibiting its binding to TLRs and the activation of pro-inflammatory cascades, thereby suppressing inflammation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and fibrosis in infarcted mice [353].",
        "sEVs derived from MSCs have also been found to suppress myocardial inflammatory responses and promote the transition from the inflammatory phase to the fibroproliferative phase. As previously mentioned, during the inflammatory phase, fibroblasts are activated and acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype, releasing inflammatory mediators while inhibiting their transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts, which possess anti-inflammatory properties and secrete extracellular matrix proteins to maintain the integrity of cardiac structure and function, play a crucial role in this transition. Studies have shown that sEVs derived from hucMSCs can significantly increase the density of myofibroblasts in the infarct area and enhance the collagen gel contraction capacity of fibroblasts on postoperative day 2 in a rat model of MI, without significantly affecting their migration and proliferation. Moreover, sEVs from hucMSCs significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α in fibroblasts [354], highlighting their important role in inflammation suppression.",
        "In the inflammatory microenvironment, the functional and phenotypic changes of immune cells are crucial for regulating inflammatory responses and promoting cardiac repair. Tregs play an important role in inhibiting the activation of the immune system. Studies have found that sEVs derived from MSCs can induce the differentiation of Tregs, thereby promoting cardiac repair. When hucMSCs were injected into the pericardium of infarcted animals (immune cells in the pericardium migrate to the mediastinal lymph nodes and lead to immune activation after cardiac injury), it was found that sEVs were taken up by MHC-II+ antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and promoted the dephosphorylation of Foxo3 by activating the PP2 A/p-Akt/Foxo3 pathway, thereby upregulating the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, IL-33, and IL-34, and promoting Tregs differentiation. This treatment ultimately significantly improved cardiac function and reduced the size of MI [355]. Macrophages undergo the most typical and dramatic phenotypic changes in the inflammatory microenvironment, and sEVs have been shown to play an important regulatory role in this process. Studies have found that miR-24-3p secreted by sEVs derived from hucMSCs can enhance the polarization of macrophages towards the M2 phenotype by inhibiting the activation of phospholipase Cβ3 (Plcb3) and NF-κB signaling pathway-related molecules [356]. sEVs secreted by ADMSCs have been found to reverse MI-induced M1 macrophage polarization and promote M2 polarization. ADMSC-sEVs have also been shown to activate the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)/sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1)/sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the expression of NF-κB p65 and TGF-β1 [357], ultimately reducing myocardial inflammatory responses and myocardial fibrosis.",
        "Studies have shown that sEVs derived from stem cells play an important role in the regulation of myocardial fibrosis following MI, primarily by targeting key fibrotic signaling pathways such as TGF-β/Smad and Angiotensin II/AT1R. sEVs secreted by adMSCs have been proven to inhibit the expression of TGFBR2 and the phosphorylation of Smad2 by transferring miR-671, thereby alleviating myocardial fibrosis. In a mouse model of MI, this effect is manifested as a reduction in myocardial collagen fiber deposition and a significant decrease in α-SMA protein expression. In addition, sEVs treatment can also significantly reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α in myocardial tissue and significantly decrease the rate of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, demonstrating their synergistic anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects [358]. sEVs secreted by BMSCs carry miR-212-5p, which can inhibit the expression of Nod-like receptor family caspase recruitment domain-containing 5 (NLRC5) and target fibroblasts that play a key role in myocardial fibrosis. NLRC5 has been shown to further promote the expression of VEGF, which in turn promotes cardiac fibrosis by activating the TGF-β1/Smad pathway and affects cardiac function [359]. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a significant role in cardiac remodeling post-MI. The RAS consists of two regulatory axes: the ACE-Angiotensin II-AT1R axis, which promotes fibrosis, and the ACE2-Angiotensin 1–7-Mas axis, which counteracts fibrosis. Studies have found that sEVs released by third-generation BMSCs can induce the expression of ACE2 in the plasma of rats with MI, thereby accelerating the conversion of Angiotensin II to Angiotensin 1–7, reducing collagen deposition in the myocardium, and improving cardiac function in rats [360].",
        "The application of cell therapy in clinical medicine initially focused primarily on the treatment of MI. During MI, a large number of cardiomyocytes are lost, and the heart’s compensatory capacity is insufficient. The goal of cell therapy is to use coronary infusion of stem cells as an adjunct to PCI to limit cardiomyocyte necrosis and prevent the progression of the disease to heart failure, a strategy also known as “cardioprotection” [361].",
        "Left ventricular remodeling is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality and is used as an important marker of clinical efficacy in cardiovascular treatments [362]. Characteristics of remodeling include gradual thinning of the ventricular wall, fibrosis, and left ventricular dilation, which can be measured by LVESV, LVEDV, infarct size, and chamber dimensions [363]. The effects of stem cell therapy are reflected in the reduction of left ventricular volume, sphericity index, infarct size, and scar size. Additionally, improved myocardial perfusion due to angiogenesis (measured by single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT] and cMRI) is also used as an efficacy indicator [364]. Most stem cell-based MI treatments have assessed their myocardial repair effects using the aforementioned remodeling indicators.",
        "BMMNCs are the earliest and most widely used cell product in the context of MI, with the advantage of not requiring in vitro culture expansion and the ability to rapidly complete autologous or allogeneic collection, separation, and reinfusion. Early clinical studies have reported that the application of BMMNCs can improve LVEF in the short term and improve indicators related to cardiac remodeling (Table 3). For example, the TOPCARE-AMI (Transplantation of Progenitor Cells and Regeneration Enhancement in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial and the BOOST (BOne Marrow transfer to enhance ST-elevation infarct regeneration) trial both injected BMMNCs into the coronary arteries of patients 5 days after AMI (TOPCARE-AMI also included groups infused with CPCs and BMCs) and followed up for 4–6 months, finding that BMMNC injection was beneficial for improving LVEF, reducing ESV, and decreasing the size of myocardial infarction [365, 366]. However, TOPCARE-AMI was a single-arm study, and BOOST was an open-label study. Subsequent Leuven-AMI and FINCELL studies further confirmed the effect of BMMNCs infusion on LVEF improvement through double-blind design [375, 376]. The REPAIR-AMI (REinfusion of ENriched Progenitor cells and Infarct Remodeling in Acute Myocardial Infarction) study is a Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial and the largest clinical trial to date for AMI. The study found that BMMNCs treatment could improve LVEF in the short term (4 months), and after 1 year of follow-up, the incidence of death, MI, and revascularization was lower in the BMMNCs group, with the advantage in the hard endpoint of mortality maintained up to 5 years after the start of the study [367].Table 3Clinical studies of stem cell therapy after MITrialDoseCell deliveryindicationnFollow-up (month)DeathMACEsEvaluation methodLVEFVolumesScar sizeTOPCARE-AMI [365]BMMNC: 213 × 106; CPC: 16 × 106Intracoronary during PCISTEMI59 (CPC: 30; BMC: 29)12NRNRLVG↑ESV ↓↓BOOST [366]BMMNC: 2.5 × 109 vs. controlintracoronary 4.8 days after PCISTEMI60 (BMMNC: 30; control: 30)6NRNScMRI↑NSNAREPAIR-AMI [367]BMMNCs: 198 × 106 vs. placebointracoronary 3–7 days after PCIAMI204 (BMC: 101; control: 103)4↓(12 month)↓ (12 month)LVG↑NSNATIME [368]BMMNCs: 150 × 106 vs. placebointracoronary 3 vs. 7 days after PCISTEMI120 (BMC: 79; placebo: 41)6NANAcMRINSNSNSLateTIME [369]BMMNCs: 150 × 106 vs. placebointracoronary 2–3 weeks after PCIAMI87 (BMMNC: 58; placebo: 29)6NANAcMRINSNSNSBOOST−2 [370]BMMNC: 20.6 × 108 vs. 7.0 × 108 vs. placebointracoronary 8 days after PCISTEMI153 (loBMC/loBMCi: 71; hiBMC/hiBMCi: 64; control: 26)6NANAcMRINSNSNSPreSERVE-AMI [371]CD34 + cells: 14.9 × 106 vs. placebointracoronary 4−11 days after PCISTEMI161 (CD34 + cells: 78; placebo: 83)6NSNScMRINSNSNSHare et al.

        "Despite these encouraging results, other trials have reached conflicting conclusions. The TIME (Timing of Adult Stem Cell Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction) and LateTIME (Timing of Adult Stem Cell Infusion in Patients with Myocardial Infarction 2 to 3 Weeks Post-Infarction) studies, initiated by the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN), are multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. The findings revealed that infusion of BMMNCs either 3–7 days post-MI or 2–3 weeks post-MI did not result in improvements in LVEF, left ventricular volumes, or wall motion function as shown by cMRI during the 6–12 month follow-up period [368, 369]. The BOOST-2 trial, building on previous research, optimized the trial design by administering low-dose BMCs (7.0 × 108), high-dose BMCs (20.6 × 108), low-dose and high-dose irradiated BMCs (via Ɣ-irradiation to eliminate clonogenic capacity, to discern whether BMC therapy efficacy relies on long-term cell survival and differentiation or acts through paracrine mechanisms) intracoronary 8 days post-PCI on average in patients with STEMI. The study found that during the 6-month follow-up, BMCs infusion did not show significant effects on LVEF and other indicators compared to the control group, and no significant differences were observed among the BMCs groups [370]. Given that BMMNCs represent an unselected cell population, the PreSERVE-AMI trial investigated the comparative effects of CD34+ cells isolated from bone marrow versus placebo infused 4–11 days post-PCI. The results indicated that improvements in LVEF, infarct size, and survival rate only became apparent after correction for ischemic duration and exhibited a cell-dose dependency [371], suggesting that this purified cell population may exert beneficial effects.",
        "The most notable characteristic of the aforementioned BMMNCs-based cell trials is their high degree of heterogeneity. This may be attributed to the inherent heterogeneity of the BMMNC cell population itself, such as the variable quality of cells derived from patients of different ages and pathological conditions. Additionally, the impact of different cell isolation and storage media, cell processing times on their bioactivity, and variations in cell dosage and injection timing may also contribute to different outcomes. This highlights the importance of adopting standardized collection protocols and processing techniques in clinical trials and the need for standardized trial protocols in comparative efficacy studies.",
        "Given the limited efficacy demonstrated by BMMNCs in clinical trials, researchers have attempted to use different cell types to explore their potential clinical roles in MI treatment. Hare et al. were the first to administer allogeneic hMSCs intravenously to patients with AMI, yielding encouraging results. The study demonstrated that intravenous injection of MSCs is not only safe but also significantly improves LVEF, particularly in patients with anterior wall infarction. Moreover, the incidence of arrhythmias in patients treated with hMSCs was significantly lower than in the placebo group [372]. Considering that the activity and function of autologous adult stem cells decline with age, Gao et al. conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 116 AMI patients, who were randomly assigned to receive intracoronary infusion of WJMSCs or placebo. The study results showed significant improvements in LVEF, LVESV, and LVEDV absolute values, as well as myocardial viability and perfusion in the WJMSCs group [373]. The CAREMI trial was the first clinical trial to use allogeneic cardiac stem cells (AlloCSC-01) in AMI patients. The study enrolled 49 STEMI patients and administered intracoronary infusion of 35 × 106 AlloCSC-01 cells to the intervention group. These cells were isolated from cardiac biopsy tissue of healthy donors and underwent immunoselection and expansion (excluding CD45+ and selecting c-kit+ cells). The study reported that intracoronary infusion of allogeneic cardiac stem cells in STEMI patients was safe, but no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of infarct size and LVEF [374].",
        "Cell therapy has made certain progress in clinical studies of cardiac remodeling following MI, but the research findings have presented a complex and diverse picture, with both encouraging discoveries and less-than-satisfactory results, as elaborated in the previous sections. Despite these advancements, the specific mechanisms by which cell therapy exerts its therapeutic effects remain incompletely understood, which to some extent limits the further optimization of trial protocols and the translation and application of new mechanisms. Therefore, this study further retrieved and analyzed major clinical trials based on mechanistic descriptions, aiming to reveal the scientific basis and potential breakthroughs of stem cell therapy, providing a more solid theoretical foundation for future research and clinical applications.",
        "In addition to the infusion of BMMNCs ex vivo, the largest number of clinical studies have focused on optimizing the mobilization of endogenous BMMNCs and their homing to the infarct region. During MI, bone marrow-derived progenitor cells are mobilized into the peripheral blood and home to ischemic myocardium to promote angiogenesis and tissue repair [377, 378]. G-CSF is an endogenous hematopoietic cytokine that mobilizes granulocytes, stem cells, and progenitor cells from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Moreover, G-CSF has been found to directly activate pro-survival signaling pathways in ischemic cardiomyocytes [379]. Therefore, G-CSF has become one of the most extensively studied molecules in mechanistic-based clinical trials.",
        "The MAGIC-Cell series of studies were the earliest clinical trials to explore the use of G-CSF to mobilize stem cells and repair damaged myocardium following MI (Table 4). In the early phase of the study, 27 subjects were enrolled and randomly divided into three groups: the cell infusion group (n = 10), the G-CSF monotherapy group (n = 10), and the control group (n = 7). The cell infusion group first received subcutaneous injections of G-CSF at a dose of 10 µg/kg for 4 days. During this period, mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) were collected. Subsequently, PBSCs were infused intracoronary during PCI treatment. The other two groups received subcutaneous G-CSF injection + PCI or PCI alone, respectively. The study found that the infusion of mobilized PBSCs intracoronary in AMI patients was feasible. During the 2-year follow-up, it was found that this significantly improved patients’ exercise tolerance, LVEF, and myocardial perfusion. However, a re-stenosis rate of nearly 1/2 to 2/3 was observed in the G-CSF treatment group, which led to the early termination of the study and became the main concern of the research team [380, 382]. To address this issue, the research team attempted to first perform PCI intervention, followed by subcutaneous injection of G-CSF and collection of mobilized PBSCs, and finally explored the therapeutic effects through intracoronary infusion. The results showed that the infusion of mobilized PBSCs significantly improved LVEF in MI patients and reduced the incidence of revascularization events, especially in patients with diabetes. However, significant improvements were only observed compared to baseline in LVESVI and infarct size. In addition, it was found that PBSCs infusion may be more effective in AMI patients than in patients with old myocardial infarction (OMI), and this effect persisted during the 2-year follow-up [381, 384]. Based on this finding, the team enrolled 74 patients to compare the differences in PBSCs collected from AMI and OMI patients. Notably, the comparison revealed higher collection efficiency of PBSCs in AMI patients, with a richer G-CSF-mobilized EPCs population, and significantly higher proportions of VE-cadherin+ cells and CD34/KDR double-positive cells in the AMI group compared to the OMI group [386]. This indicates that the efficiency of G-CSF-mobilized stem cells is affected by the timing of mobilization, and it may be easier to mobilize higher-quality stem cell populations during the acute phase. Furthermore, the study evaluated the impact of G-CSF-mobilized PBSCs on coronary vessels by implanting drug-eluting stents. The results demonstrated that G-CSF-mobilized stem cells do not increase the intimal area but have a positive effect on the average stent surrounding immune response, thereby promoting coronary vessel remodeling [383]. With the in-depth exploration of the therapeutic mechanisms of cell therapy, the team launched the MAGIC cell-5-combination cytokine trial in 2011, aiming to explore the impact of G-CSF combined with darbepoetin on cardiac remodeling following MI. Darbepoetin is a long-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating agent that has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes from ischemia-induced necrosis or apoptosis and induce angiogenesis by stimulating EPCs [385]. The findings of this trial will provide new research directions and scientific basis for the mobilization of BMSCs to promote myocardial remodeling.Table 4Clinical studies based on mechanistic descriptions of G-CSFTrialDoseCell deliveryindicationnumberFollow-up (month)DeathMACEsLVEFLVESVIScar sizeMAGIC Cell [380]10 ug/kg, once a day*4 daysPBSCs collected at the 5th day of injection(started after DES), intracoronaryAMI27 (PBSCs: 10; G-CSF: 7; control: 7)6NRNR↑NANAMAGIC Cell−3-DES [381]10 ug/kg, once a day*3 daysPBSCs collected at the 5th day of injection(started after DES), intracoronaryAMI, OMI96 (AMI + PBSCs: 25; AMI control: 25; OMI + PBSCs: 16; OMI control: 16)6NRNR↑NSNSMAGIC Cell 1 [382]10 ug/kg, once a day*4 daysPBSCs collected at the 5th day of injection, intracoronaryAMI, OMI30(PBSCs: 10; G-CSF: 10; control: 10)24NRNR↑↑NAMAGIC Cell−3-DES (sirolimus-eluting or paclitaxel-eluting stent) [383]10 ug/kg, once a day*3 daysPBSCs collected at the 4th day of injection, intracoronaryAMI36(PBSCs: 19; control: 17)6NANANANANAMAGIC Cell−3-DES [384]10 ug/kg, once a day*3 daysPBSCs collected at the 4th day of injection, intracoronaryAMI, OMI163(AMI + PBSCs: 57; AMI control: 60; OMI + PBSCs: 22; OMI control: 24)30NS↓NSNANAMAGICcell−5-combination cytokine trial [385]5 ug/kg; twice a day*3 day; 4.5 ug/kgPBSCs collected at the 4th day of injection, intracoronary; darbepoetin after PCI, intravenousSTEMI116(PBSCs + darbepoetin: 58; PBSCs: 29; control: 29)6NRNRNRNRNRNS not significant; NA not associated; NR not reported",

        "STEM-AMI OUTCOME (Prognosis of Stem Cell Mobilization in Acute Myocardial Infarction) is the largest prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label Phase III clinical trial in this field to date. The study enrolled 532 patients with STEMI and assessed the effects of subcutaneous injection of 5 µg/kg G-CSF 24 h post-PCI on cardiac function. CMR evaluation revealed significant improvements in LVEF, left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI), infarct size, and 2D global longitudinal and circumferential strain in patients receiving G-CSF. Additionally, the study included a subset of high-risk patients, defined as those with persistent left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 45%) following successful reperfusion, who were considered at higher risk for adverse left ventricular remodeling. The results indicated that G-CSF could serve as an effective therapeutic option for these patients [387]. The study also conducted stratified analyses to explore the impact of different degrees of bone marrow cell mobilization on cardiac function. It was found that patients with low bone marrow cell mobilization (leukocyte count ≤ 50 × 109/L) had a lower trend in the composite primary endpoint compared to those with high mobilization (leukocyte count > 50 × 109/L), although the results were not statistically significant (p = 0.06) [388].",
        "The REVIVAL-2 study enrolled 114 patients with AMI and administered 10 µg/kg G-CSF subcutaneously once daily to the intervention group starting on day 5 post-PCI. The study found significant increases in CD34+ cells and leukocytes, with peak levels observed on day 5 of treatment. However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of LVEF, infarct size, or re-stenosis rate [389]. The study speculated that the mobilized stem cells might not have effectively homed to the infarcted myocardium, or they might have been too immature to participate effectively in myocardial repair. Alternatively, the timing of G-CSF administration might not have aligned with the optimal therapeutic window post-MI. Four years later, the team published mechanistic study results, analyzing venous blood samples collected on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 post-G-CSF injection. They found that G-CSF significantly reduced the expression of progenitor cell surface molecules lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), very late antigen 4 (VLA-4), and CXCR4. At the mRNA level, it also reduced the expression of CXCR4 and the anti-proliferative protein transducer of Erk-binding protein (TOB) [390]. Adhesion molecules (such as LFA-1, VLA-4, and CXCR4) are key molecules in the bone marrow microenvironment of progenitor cells, maintaining stem cell retention through binding to ligands (such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and SDF-1). Disrupting these interactions has been shown to mobilize progenitor cells into the peripheral circulation [391]. However, these changes might also have weakened the homing capacity of progenitor cells to cardiomyocytes, despite their potentially higher proliferative potential. These findings also explain why G-CSF failed to improve infarct size and left ventricular function in AMI treatment. The study also provided 7-year follow-up results, with 106 patients completing the follow-up. The long-term results were consistent with the short-term findings, indicating that although G-CSF alone could mobilize BMSCs, it had no significant impact on the long-term clinical outcomes (including mortality, recurrent MI, and stroke) of AMI patients [392]. The TECAM trial and a study by Guo et al. reached similar conclusions, suggesting that subcutaneous injection of G-CSF might not significantly improve cardiac function or left ventricular remodeling in AMI patients. The former also found no significant differences when compared to the use of BMMNCs alone or in combination with BMMNCs [393, 394].",
        "The CAPITAL STEM MI trial compared the efficacy of subcutaneous injection of G-CSF on days 3 or 4 after PCI in patients with AMI, but it was found that patients in the G-CSF group had a significant decrease in LVEF [395]. The study suggested that this might be attributed to the selection of study subjects, as the trial included patients with moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 45%), who might be more sensitive to the application of G-CSF. Additionally, compared with previous studies that initiated G-CSF treatment within 24 h after PCI, G-CSF treatment in this study was started within 4 days after MI, and this delay might have affected the therapeutic effect, indicating the significant impact of the timing of treatment on efficacy. The study also pointed out that G-CSF might activate neutrophils, thereby triggering inflammatory reactions or thrombosis, which could have a negative impact on the already impaired myocardial function. Moreover, the failure of stem cell mobilization to effectively participate in myocardial repair might also be a reason for the lack of positive results in the trial. Further mechanistic exploration is needed to explain these findings.",
        "The FIRSTLINE-AMI trial was the first to initiate subcutaneous injection of G-CSF within 90 min after PCI to improve ventricular remodeling, and the results showed that it could significantly improve LVEF in patients with AMI, but had no significant effect on LVESVI [396]. The G-CSF-STEMI trial included patients with subacute MI and initiated G-CSF treatment on day 1 after PCI. The results indicated that although there were no significant differences in LVEF and MACEs between the G-CSF group and the control group, G-CSF treatment significantly improved resting myocardial perfusion in the infarct area within 1 month [397]. This suggests that G-CSF might enhance angiogenesis in the infarct area, thereby participating in the promotion of ischemic myocardial repair.",
        "Meanwhile, focusing on the impact of G-CSF-mobilized stem cell subpopulations on cardiac function recovery, the STEMMI trial enrolled 78 STEMI patients who were randomly assigned to receive G-CSF (10 µg/kg/day for 6 days) or standard treatment after PCI, and characterized the mobilized stem cells. The results showed that after G-CSF mobilization, the number of CD34 + cells and mesenchymal stem cells in peripheral blood of patients significantly increased, but the proportion of MSCs was inconsistent. For example, the number of MSCs positive for CD73 (an early stem cell marker) and CD31 (an endothelial marker) was significantly lower than that in the control group. Moreover, it was found that the number of circulating MSCs in peripheral blood was negatively correlated with changes in LVEF. The reason for this phenomenon is considered to be that these peripheral blood MSCs subpopulations with lower proportions might more easily home to the infarcted myocardium, thereby effectively participating in the repair process [398]. Additionally, this selective mobilization characteristic of G-CSF also provides clues for further exploration of molecular mechanisms and the conduct of clinical trials, such as improving the mobilization ability of certain cells that are more likely to home to the infarct area, thereby enhancing mobilization efficiency.",
        "G-CSF as a potent endogenous hematopoietic cytokine can effectively mobilize stem cells into the bloodstream and is theoretically beneficial for the repair of damaged myocardium. However, results from multiple clinical studies indicate that the efficacy of G-CSF may be significantly influenced by various factors, including the timing of G-CSF injection, the administration method of the mobilized cells, and the cell source. Future research that standardizes these key factors or explores their combination with other means (such as erythropoietin [EPO] and other pro-cellular factors [399]) may provide new research directions for improving ventricular remodeling post-MI and lead to more desirable therapeutic outcomes.",
        "The MAGNUM clinical trial enrolled 15 patients scheduled for off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). During surgery, autologous BMCs were injected into the myocardial scar region while covering and securing a 3D collagen type I matrix with sutures to provide a microenvironment conducive to cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. The study found that this approach was safe, improved myocardial perfusion, limited ventricular remodeling, and enhanced patients’ cardiac function classification [400], which is of great significance for improving patients’ quality of life. Notably, the thickness of the myocardial scar region significantly increased, indicating that the use of this bioartificial myocardium may facilitate the formation and maturation of fibrous scars and reduce the occurrence of serious adverse events such as cardiac rupture. However, this small-scale study lacked a control group, so it could not definitively attribute the improvements to cell therapy or surgery. This question awaits answers from larger-scale randomized controlled studies in the future.",
        "The use of ATV in combination with stem cells for the treatment of AMI has been extensively explored in preclinical studies. The TEAM-AMI trial enrolled 100 patients with anterior STEMI and compared the efficacy of conventional ATV (20 mg/day) and intensive ATV (80 mg/day) in combination with autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCINJ) versus placebo injection. The primary endpoint was the change in LVEF, with secondary endpoints including parameters related to cardiac function, remodeling, and regeneration. The results of this study will provide more substantial evidence for the efficacy of ATV in improving post-MI myocardial remodeling, that is, whether improving the inflammatory environment can promote the function of stem cells in repairing myocardial tissue, and will also provide clear indicators for the adjunctive dosage of ATV [362, 363]. Previously, the STRAP study found that patients receiving intensive treatment (taking 80 mg of ATV daily from admission) had significantly higher EPC counts at 4-month follow-up compared to standard treatment, indicating that ATV treatment also aids in the mobilization of bone marrow stem cells [401].",
        "PeriCord is an engineered tissue graft composed of decellularized pericardial matrix and WJ-MSCs. During CABG, PeriCord was fixed to the scar surface with surgical glue in MI patients. The study found that PeriCord successfully integrated into the myocardium without causing immune rejection and significantly modulated the proportion of peripheral blood mononuclear cell subpopulations, characterized by an increase in the number of non-classical anti-inflammatory monocytes (CD14−CD16+). Additionally, the plasma levels of Metrnl were significantly reduced post-PeriCord implantation [402], indicating its key role in immune regulation.",
        "Thymosin β4 (Tβ4) is a small molecule protein with high affinity for EPCs, capable of inducing EPCs migration and protecting them from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. Preclinical studies have confirmed that EPCs pretreated with Tβ4 can significantly increase vascular density and reduce infarct size in animal infarction tissues [403]. ZHU et al. were the first to attempt intracoronary infusion of EPCs pretreated with Tβ4 (1000 ng/mL) for 24 h into patients with STEMI and found that this method could significantly improve left ventricular function in patients, including LVEF and stroke volume (SV), and showed significant advantages in the 6-minute walk test of patients [404]. Although this was a small-scale pilot study, it provided a new direction for the pro-angiogenic effects in the myocardial infarction repair process. The ENACT-AMI (Enhanced Angiogenesis Cellular Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction) study aimed to evaluate the effect of intracoronary infusion of autologous early EPCs on cardiac function improvement. The study found that an important limitation of autologous cell therapy is the adverse effects of age and cardiac risk factors on progenitor cell activity [405]. eNOS can catalyze the synthesis of NO, which plays an important role in vascular endothelial function. Increased eNOS expression has been shown to promote vasodilation, improve local microcirculation, and promote angiogenesis, thereby reducing myocardial ischemia and infarct size [406]. The study cultured peripheral blood MNCs in vitro to form endothelial-like cells with high regenerative capacity (E-CMMs) and transfected them with eNOS after 4–6 days of culture, ultimately obtaining a new type of enhanced autologous progenitor cells. Patients received intracoronary infusion of 20 million autologous E-CMMs and their efficacy was assessed by measuring endpoints such as LVEF, regional wall thickness, infarct size, and MACEs [407]. ENACT-AMI is the first clinical study to combine gene modification with cell therapy for the treatment of AMI, and it is believed that its research results will endow the treatment of ventricular remodeling post-MI from the perspective of promoting angiogenesis with important clinical significance.",
        "Preclinical studies have shown that ischemic preconditioning can significantly enhance the anti-apoptotic ability and hypoxia tolerance of stem cells, thereby making them more likely to survive and function effectively in the ischemic microenvironment post-MI. The CHINA-AMI study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I clinical trial, enrolling 22 patients with STEMI. Patients were randomly assigned to receive intracoronary infusion of normoxic BMCs (N-BMCs, n = 11) or hypoxia-preconditioned BMCs (HP-BMCs, n = 11) after routine reperfusion therapy, with an additional 14 patients receiving standard therapy as a control group. BMCs were processed by culturing for 24 h in normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (0.5% O2) environments, and the intracoronary infusion dose was 1 × 107 BMCs. At 30-day and 1-year follow-ups, there were no significant differences in the incidence of MACEs among the three groups. SPECT showed that compared to baseline, the proportion of myocardial perfusion defects in the N-BMCs and HP-BMCs groups significantly decreased at 6 and 12 months. In addition, the LVEDV and LVESV in the HP-BMCs group were significantly improved at 6 and 12 months, and the wall motion score index (WMSI) significantly decreased at 6 months [408]. In addition, studies have assessed the effect of ischemic postconditioning (PostC) on EPCs recruitment in patients with STEMI. The study demonstrated that PostC has benefits in improving endothelial function and reducing infarct size [409]. The study enrolled 20 patients with STEMI and randomly assigned them to the PostC group and the conventional PCI group. In the PostC group, after successfully opening the infarct-related artery (IRA) and restoring blood flow, the vessel blood flow was completely occluded by inflating a balloon to 2–4 atmospheres, and the balloon was rapidly deflated after 60 s to restore blood flow for 60 s. The above operation was repeated four times in a cycle. The study found that there were no significant differences in the number of different EPC subpopulations in the PostC group compared to before the intervention, but the time from symptom onset to balloon inflation (re-occlusion treatment) was negatively correlated with the mobilization of progenitor precursor cells [410]. This suggests that EPCs recruitment may be related to ischemic time, and future studies need to further explore the specific mechanisms of PostC on EPCs recruitment and how to optimize this endogenous repair mechanism to improve the prognosis of patients with STEMI.",
        "Combined cell therapy aims to enhance the efficacy of stem cells through complementary effects. A Phase I clinical study enrolled 15 subjects (combined cell therapy group: 10; control group: 5) and evaluated the efficacy of intracoronary infusion of the combined cell product (7.5 × 106 MSCs and 7.5 × 106 MNCs) on cardiac function in AMI patients. The results showed that intracoronary infusion of the combined cell product was safe and feasible and did not cause ischemic or infarction events in the injection area. In addition, in the treatment group, the baseline SDS score (i.e., myocardial perfusion difference score) was significantly higher than the score at 3 months, indicating a reduction in myocardial ischemia burden, and the use of nitroglycerin by patients was significantly reduced, with a significant improvement in quality of life [411].",
        "From the formulation of clinical questions to an in-depth exploration of their underlying mechanisms, and ultimately to the resolution of these clinical issues, the process is complex and lengthy. In the field of MI treatment, cell therapy, as an emerging therapeutic modality, exemplifies this translational process. Initially, basic research revealed that stem cell therapy appears to have potential protective effects on ischemic myocardial tissue following MI, offering new hope for treating MI. Subsequently, a series of clinical trials further confirmed the safety of cell products in treating MI. However, despite the good tolerability of cell therapy in clinical applications, its effects on improving patient cardiac function and reducing cardiac tissue remodeling have been less than ideal. This outcome suggests that mere safety is not sufficient to meet the needs of clinical treatment, and the efficacy of cell therapy still requires further optimization.",
        "To address this issue, researchers began to delve into the specific pathways by which cell therapy improves myocardial remodeling post-MI at the mechanistic level. In recent years, basic research has unveiled that cell therapy may exert its effects through multiple mechanisms, including promoting myocardial regeneration, facilitating scar maturation, modulating the immune environment, and enhancing angiogenesis. These discoveries provide a theoretical foundation for further optimizing cell therapy. However, current research still has limitations. For instance, although existing clinical studies have to some extent validated the potential mechanisms of cell therapy, the effects have not yet reached the ideal therapeutic goals. Moreover, a substantial number of preclinical studies still need to be further verified in clinical settings. Future research may need to further clarify the specific mechanisms of cell therapy in MI treatment, which may include intracellular components such as cytokines and extracellular vesicles, especially in the key aspects of myocardial repair and tissue remodeling. The preparation and application strategies of cell products have also been proven to be key factors affecting efficacy. Further validation of the efficacy and safety of cell therapy through multicenter, larger sample, randomized controlled studies will also provide high-quality results for cell therapy.",
        "The application of stem cell therapy in post-MI myocardial remodeling primarily focuses on promoting cardiomyocyte regeneration to replace lost myocardial tissue due to infarction and reverse adverse myocardial remodeling processes. However, despite the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific markers by stem cell-derived CLCs, significant differences remain in morphology and function compared to mature cardiomyocytes. These cells fail to fully exhibit the contractile function and electrophysiological properties characteristic of cardiomyocytes, which are fundamental to their critical role in cardiac tissue. Thus, we are still far from achieving the regeneration of “truly functional cardiomyocytes”. Future research needs to delve into several key questions: (1) Functional validation: Can stem cell-derived CLCs exert functions similar to mature cardiomyocytes in vivo, including contractility, electrical conductivity, and metabolic activity? (2) Clinical translation: Do these cells function consistently with in vitro experimental results in the human body, and what are their long-term effects and safety profiles? (3) Immune compatibility: How can stem cell products be optimized to enhance their immunotolerance in the human body and reduce immune rejection?",
        "Early infiltration of inflammatory cells post-MI is a crucial step in tissue repair, involving the release and regulation of various pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-1β) and chemokines (such as MCP-1, CXCL1). These inflammatory mediators not only participate in the clearance of necrotic tissue but also influence subsequent fibrosis and angiogenesis. Therefore, exploring the regulatory effects of stem cell therapy on the inflammatory microenvironment may provide a new direction for improving myocardial remodeling. MSCs, a vital component of stem cell therapy, have been shown to possess significant immunomodulatory properties, capable of regulating inflammatory responses by secreting anti-inflammatory factors (such as IL-10, TGF-β) and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-6). However, current research primarily focuses on the mechanisms of action of MSCs, while the roles of other stem cell types (such as iPSCs) in the inflammatory microenvironment remain less clear. Additionally, how to maintain the balance between inflammation and repair, such as how to optimize anti-inflammatory effects through stem cell therapy to promote tissue repair without causing excessive fibrosis; or whether the combination of anti-inflammatory drugs and stem cell therapy can further improve the post-MI inflammatory microenvironment, may be potential future research directions.",
        "Fibroblasts and the ECM play key roles at different stages post-MI. During the inflammatory phase, fibroblasts are activated, secreting pro-inflammatory factors and MMPs to participate in tissue degradation and repair. In the proliferative phase, fibroblasts are activated into myofibroblasts, synthesizing and depositing collagen to form scar tissue. In the maturation phase, fibroblasts gradually undergo apoptosis, collagen fibers cross-link, and the scar tissue matures. Although studies have shown that stem cell therapy can influence fibroblast activity and ECM remodeling, it is currently unclear whether stem cells have different mechanisms of action at these different stages. Therefore, how to achieve stage-specific intervention, that is, how to design targeted stem cell therapy strategies based on the characteristics of different stages post-MI to optimize tissue repair and remodeling, may be a key focus for future research.",
        "The dynamic changes of endothelial cells following MI are crucial for the recovery of cardiac function. Studies have shown that endothelial cells exhibit pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic properties during the inflammatory phase; they participate in the formation and maturation of new blood vessels during the proliferative phase; and their functions gradually stabilize during the scar maturation phase. Although research has described the dynamic changes of endothelial cells post-MI, focusing mainly on functional changes over time, it is not entirely accurate to simply categorize the dynamic evolution of endothelial cells into the inflammatory, proliferative, and maturation phases based on time points. This may also be due to the overlap between different functional stages of endothelial cells, which cannot be clearly distinguished. Moreover, as evidenced by the content of this paper, with the advancement of technology, we have been able to dynamically identify the functional and phenotypic changes of endothelial cells following MI. This undoubtedly brings more directions for the treatment of post-MI remodeling. For example, can we regulate the apoptotic phenotype and metabolic changes of endothelial cells through the action of cells and their derivatives to promote endothelial cell survival, improve the microvascular network, and reduce tissue remodeling? Or can we promote the mesenchymal phenotypic transition of endothelial cells to enhance angiogenesis and anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects? There are many areas worth exploring in depth.",
        "Despite multiple clinical trials indicating that stem cell therapy holds potential for improving myocardial remodeling post-MI, its effects have not yet reached the ideal therapeutic goals. For example, BMMNCs have shown improvements in left ventricular function in some studies, but other studies have failed to replicate these results. This discrepancy may be related to factors such as cell source, processing methods, injection timing, and individual patient differences. Future research needs to further validate the efficacy and safety of cell therapy through multicenter, large-sample, and standardized randomized controlled trials, and explore standardized cell preparation and application protocols.",
        "Moreover, the clinical application of stem cell therapy still faces many challenges that need to be addressed. First, the safety of cell products is one of the key issues. How to ensure the long-term safety of stem cell products in the human body, especially in terms of immune reactions and tumor formation risks, is a focus of future research. Second, optimizing therapeutic effects is another urgent issue. By optimizing cell dosage, injection methods, and treatment timing, the efficacy of stem cell therapy can be further improved, making it more advantageous in clinical applications. Finally, long-term follow-up studies are crucial for assessing the long-term effects of stem cell therapy and its impact on patients’ quality of life. Answers to these questions will provide important evidence for the clinical application of stem cell therapy.",
        "Cell therapy, as an emerging treatment for myocardial remodeling post-MI, holds great potential but still faces many challenges. Future research needs to delve into the mechanisms of cell therapy, optimize treatment strategies, and validate their efficacy and safety in clinical settings, starting from multiple aspects such as mechanism research, clinical application, new technology development, and combination therapies. Although the road ahead is long, with the continuous advancement of research, cell therapy is expected to bring new breakthroughs in the treatment of myocardial remodeling post-MI and offer more hope for patients.",

        "Myocardial infarction (MI) is the most severe type of cardiovascular diseases that is accompanied with sudden cardiac death [1]. This disease is mainly detected in developed countries, but it also affects the developing countries. It is considered the main cause of death worldwide [2]. Furthermore, MI survivors are susceptible to a high risk of heart failure (HF) [3]. The MI-related HF causes high morbidity and mortality rates. It affects around 6 million people in the United States with 300,000 incidences of death per year costing approximately $40 billion representing a huge burden on the healthcare system [4].",
        "MI, also known as heart attack, is defined as the complete blockage of heart microcirculation leading to hypoxia and death of cardiomyocytes. This blockage is caused by the narrowing of blood vessels where the heart does not receive enough oxygen (ischemia) leading to the disturbance of proper blood supply to different organs in the body. It is worth mentioning that atherosclerosis, which is the plaque formation, is the main cause of ischemia [5].",
        "There are several types of MI depending on its pathophysiology. Type 1 MI is due to an atherosclerotic plaque erosion or rupture causing partial or complete blockage in myocardial blood supply leading to myocyte necrosis. Type II MI is also a spontaneous event; however, the underlying cause is not a coronary artery disease. It is mainly caused by an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand due to various reasons as coronary artery spasm, HF, anemia, hypotension, hypertension, renal failure, or major procedures [6]. Type III MI results in sudden unexpected cardiac death even before any increase in biomarkers levels could be detected [7]. Moreover, type IV and V are due to surgical interventions as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stent thrombosis and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).",
        "It is worth mentioning that following the incidence of MI in human patients, more than one billion cardiac cells are being lost by necrosis and less often by apoptosis. Knowing the fact that the adult mammalian heart has negligible regenerative capacity, during the healing phase, the dead cardiomyocytes are replaced with non-contractile fibrotic scar to maintain the cardiac integrity avoiding any catastrophic events as cardiac rupture. The infarct healing process could be then divided into three different phases: inflammatory, proliferative/fibrotic, and maturation/ventricular remodeling phase as shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Illustration of the infarction microenvironment and the three healing phases [8]",
        "Illustration of the infarction microenvironment and the three healing phases [8]",
        "The acute inflammatory phase lasts from 1–7 days during which the necrotic cardiomyocytes activate several immunological pathways [9]. The surviving cardiac cells and resident fibroblasts trigger inflammation by activating several pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Subsequently, the neutrophils and monocytes are recruited to the infarcted region to remove dead cells. Moreover, pro-inflammatory macrophages are also recruited to the injured area and they secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) causing phagocytosis and tissue digestion [10]. As a result, the extracellular matrix is altered due to degradation of collagen and hyalournan by MMPs followed by matrix deposition of fibrin providing the needed structural support for infiltration of immune cells. Despite the importance of early inflammatory activation to promote the reparative program, an excessive prolonged inflammatory phase can lead to adverse tissue damage, extensive cell loss, defective scar formation and consequently, infarction expansion [11].",
        "The proliferative phase extends from 1–3 weeks. It is mainly characterized by removal of apoptotic neutrophils and activation of an anti-inflammatory pathway to allow the heart to repair itself. Anti-inflammatory macrophages, leukocytes and lymphocytes are involved in this phase by contributing to the alleviation of inflammation and promoting angiogenesis [10]. This phase is also characterized by cardiac fibroblast proliferation and migration to defected myocardium. Cardiac fibroblasts thus become the most abundant cell population in the heart during this stage, where they differentiate into activated myofibroblast phenotype. These cardiac myofibroblasts play an important role in deposition of collagen and fibronectin in addition to synthesis of other extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that provide the structural support, maintain tissue integrity and contribute to scar formation. These cells also secrete anti-inflammatory molecules and pro-angiogenic factors to promote the reparative process [12]. The goal of this stage mainly is to replace the necrotic cardiac tissue with viable fibrotic tissue to fulfil the needed physical support. On the other hand, the excessive deposition of ECM proteins will exagerate the fibrosis process attenuating the heart contractility and increasing the risk of heart failure [13].",
        "Finally the third stage; the scar maturation once initiated, lasts from weeks to months. During this phase, the composition of ECM is altered through crosslinking of collagen to provide myocardial strength. Additionally, the number of cardiac fibroblast decline by becoming quiescent and undergoing apoptosis. Moreover, angiogenesis in this stage is terminated [14]. Unfortunately, the formation of non-functioning fibrotic tissue during the healing process, represents a burden on the distant viable left ventricular region in order to maintain an adequate cardiac output. This pressure and load can reactivate the inflammatory and fibrotic pathways causing extensive left ventricular remodeling. Moreover, the persistance of cardiac fibroblasts within myocardium can extend up to years after the injury. Their presence can promote fibrosis in non-infacted myocardial regions leading to heart failure [15].",
        "Conventional treatement of MI mainly relies on rapid restoration of cardiac blood flow using pharmacological and catheter based interventions as well as reducing the risk of any recurrent coronary thrombotic events [16].",
        "The administration of thrombolytic therapy within the first 6h from MI incidence can be the most effective curative therapy to restore perfusion [17]. They act mainly by dissolving the blood clot. However, if the main cause of thrombus is not known and addressed, the patient may face the risk of re-thrombosis incidence within the first hours of MI [18]. Additionally, these thrombolytic agents are associated with some complications as spontaneous hemorrhage [19], hypotension, allergic or anaphylactic reactions [18]. Antiplatelet agents as aspirin or antithrombin agents as heparin are also used to restore blood flow.",
        "Due to limitations of thrombolytic agents, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been used for perfusion. It is a non-surgical procedure in which a guide catheter is introduced into blocked coronary artery to inject a contrast dye and visualize the blockage. Simultaneously, another catheter with a balloon at its tip is inflated to unclog the blockage and restore vascularization. The implementation of a stent may be also required to maintain the coronary artery patency for a longer period of time [20].",
        "Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) is an effective surgical intervention to restore blood flow. A healthy vessel is grafted within diseased coronary artery to bypass the blocked region [21]. CABG is a practical solution to avoid incidence of restenosis, in addition, it can minimize hospital mortality. However, it is an expensive procedure with the possible incidence of post-surgical complications.",
        "Nevertheless, it has been proven that the restoration of blood flow either by PCI or thrombolytic therapy during ischemia causes an injury called “ Ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R)”. Numerous studies have investigated the underlying causes of I/R which include oxidative stress, apoptosis and other interrelated mechanisms that aggravate cardiomyocytes death [22].",
        "Thus, the main treatment goals following immediate reperfusion include stabilization of coronary lesion, treatment of ischemia and secondary prevention.Traditional pharmacotherapy used to treat MI patients include β-blockers and nitrates. β-blockers reduce the load on myocardium by lowering blood pressure and heart rate. They exert anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and antifibrotic features, however, their effect is restricted due to poor bioavailability, limited permeability, short half life and their adverse reactions [23, 24]. It is worthmentioning that after stabilization of patient’s condition, several cardioprotective drugs and life style modifications should be done to prevent long term complications. Cardioprotective drugs in secondary management aim to reduce elevated blood pressure and monitor cholesterol levels using several drugs as angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors (ACEIs) and statins [25]. Concerning ACEIs, they decrease blood pressure, reduce ventricular remodelling and minimize cardiac hypertrophy, thus reducing mortality rate. However, they cause several side effects as angioedema, hypotension and renal failure. Statins act by preventing plaque formation through the reduction of low denisty lipoprotein (LDL) in addition to the attenuation of inflammation [26]. On the other hand, statins are characterized by low bioavailability and extensive first pass metabolism. Moreover, they increase risk of myopathy. Thus, the use of both ACEIs and statins are limited due to their aforementioned drawbacks.",
        "The current pharmacological and surgical therapies managed to reduce mortality rate, but they failed to address and compensate the loss of cardiomyocytes and vasculature [27]. Therefore, the future therapeutic target should focus on cardiac regeneration to restore myocardial contractility and reduce incidence of MI-HF. The recent approaches that can enhance the regeneration of myocardium are mainly focused on cell-based therapies [28] and cell-free approaches.",
        "Initially, due to inability to obtain functional cardiomyocytes to restore myocardial contractility, non-cardiac cells were transplanted as skeletal myoblast. The skeletal myoblasts were extracted from skeletal muscles of patient, expanded and implanted within heart. However, it did not improve contractility of heart and caused several complications [29]. The more recent cellular generations used human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) that were purified from bone marrow aspirate. Adipose tissue also represented another source for purification of hMSCs. These cells showed a trend towards improvement of cardiac function and increased vasculature in the infarct [30]. Due to doubt in the cardiomyogenic potential of MSCs shown in some studies, there has been a shift towards cardiac stem cells (CSCs). These are resident cardiac cells with self-renewal potential. Limited clinical data investigated the implementation of CSCs and reported its low engrafment potential. In addition, it did not show an improvement in ventricular function and was not considered as an effective therapy for treatment of heart failure [31]. Finally, the interest was shifted towards pluripotent stem cells to overcome the doubt of the ability of MSCs to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. The pluripotent cells can differentiate into cardiomyocytes in vitro before being transplanted within the heart [32].",
        "The cell based therapy faces a great challenge that constrains its efficacy mainly due to poor survival and low engrafment rate of transplanted cells as shown in Fig. 2. The rough ischemic environment due to injury limits the endurance of cells [33]. Moreover, obtaining the required number of cells is also challenging as source tissue does not contain enough cells. Therefore, the cells should be cultivated in vitro for expansion. However, the cells become more liable to aging with subsequent morphological and genetic changes that affect their proliferation and survival. In addition, senescent cells may affect the surrounding cells by spreading senescence through the secretion of certain factors which attenuate the success of the regeneration therapeutic approach.Fig. 2Drawbacks of cell-based therapy [34]",
        "Drawbacks of cell-based therapy [34]",
        "The route of administration is another factor that affects engrafment rate of transplanted cells. Cells can be delivered by several routes including intramyocardial, intracoronary and intravenous route. The intramyocardial route is the most common route for cell delivery, however, it is considered as an invasive route that requires open chest surgery. Intracoronary injection is accomplished through injection of cells within the coronary artery or cardiac vein and it is less stressful than intramyocardial route. The intravenous route despite being the least invasive route, leads to major loss of transplanted cells due to entrapment of cells within different organs during their movement within blood stream. Moreover, the transplanted cells carry the risk of teratoma formation and risk of rejection.",
        "Despite that some theories still attribute the beneficial effects of cellular therapy, there has been an increased interest in discovering new cell-free cardiac regeneration approaches due to the presence of major challenges facing the cell-based approach of cardiac regeneration such as low engrafment and survival rate to the paracrine hypothesis.",
        "An approach in cell- free therapy includes the use of secreted products from cells to act as the therapeutic material rather than the cell itself including cell secretomes and extracellular vesicles. A key element is the use of stem cells as they are considered as a key therapeutic tool in the field of regenerative medicine including cardiac regeneration. They secrete active molecules including various growth factors and cytokines [35] that protect the surrounding cardiovascular tissue by activating angiogeneic, antifibrotic and antiapoptotic paracrine pathways [36]. The use of exosomes as an example of extracellular vesicles has evolved as a cell-free approach to enhance cardiac regeneration. Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by cells containing bioactive molecules as protein, RNA, DNA and lipids. These exosomes can enhance angiogenesis, reduce fibrosis and improve ejection fraction of left ventricle [37].",
        "Other alternative regenerative cell-free approaches include innovative in vivo reprogramming strategy that depends on conversion of cardiofibroblasts into cardiomyocyte like cells [38, 39].",
        "Nanotechnology, on the other hand has offered a huge platform to adminster different drugs, growth factors, natural products that can reduce the size of infarction and promote cardiac regeneration. This can be achieved by different mechanisms including:Targeting excessive fibrotic response post MI to reduce cardiac remodelling [40].Scavenging the accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) that trigger DNA damage causing cellular senescence and death, which represents a great barrier towards cardiac regeneration [41].Attenuating excessive post MI inflammation that exagerates cardiomyocyte injury and threatens its survival. Attenuating the inflammation leads to formation of tensile healing scar through suppression of protease enzyme activity and the activation of certain chemokines that recruit progenitor cells to infarct site promoting angiogenesis and promoting cardiac regeneration [42].Administrating moieties with anti-apoptotic potential improving survival of resident cardiomyocytes.Enhancing angiogenesis and promoting perfusion within infarction, thus enhancing its recovery [43].",

        "Nanomedicine can offer different nanocarriers to enable the delivery of various therapeutics to the ischemic myocardium performing the aforementioned mechanisms and promoting cardiac healing post MI. These nanocarriers have many advantages including the ability to target the therapeutics directly to the ischemic myocardium. In addition, the nanocarriers can protect therapeutics liable to degradation and control their release [44, 45]. Nanoformulations can be prepared using different materials including polymers ( as Polylactic co-glycolic acid “PLGA”), lipids and metals (as gold and silver). Nanomedicines targeting myocardium can be administered using different routes as intramyocardial, intracoronary and intravenous. The intramyocardial route is highly invasive and might cause further injury to weakened myocardium. The intracoronary route is less invasive, as it depends on catheter-based delivery of therapeutics directly to coronary artery [46]. However, it carries the risk of embolism in addition to that the catheter is not always compatible with all the cargo and the nanocarriers used. Therefore, the intravenous route remains the least invasive and preferred route for delivery. Nanomedicine targets the diseased organ either by passive or active targeting. Passive targeting is based on the physicochemical properties of the diseased organ and enhanced permeation and retention phenomenon (EPR), while active targeting relies on the utilization of certain ligands. This review will focus on nanocarriers loaded with cell-free therapeutic as drugs, natural products, genetic material or growth factor that is passively or actively targeted to ischemic myocardium to promote its regeneration.",
        "The enhanced permeation and retention ( EPR) effect was reported in the myocardium after infarction and ischemia [47]. EPR means that there is preferential accumulation of nanocarrier in diseased organ after being extravasted from blood due to presence of abnormal highly permeable vasculature within this organ due to injury or inflammation. This phenomenon was first described in cancer as rapid proliferation of tumors requires increased oxygen demand promoting angiogenesis. However, the formed vessels become chaotic and leaky [48]. The EPR effect also occurs after myocardial infarction due to upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that tends to increase vascular permeability and promotes angiogenesis within ischemic myocardium to aid in restoring blood flow and oxygen supply [49]. However, the post MI-EPR effect is characterized by being poor and tends to disappear within 48 h unlike that of cancerous tissue. Despite this limitation, several studies have reported that nanocarriers whose size ranges between 100–200 nm are advantageous through post MI-EPR effect [50, 51].",
        "Polymeric nanocarriers are characterized by being stable, where they can protect encapsulated cargo and offer a sustained drug release manner. A sustained release pattern is required to provide maximum protection of cardiomyocytes and promote cardiac regeneration [52]. Polylactic co-glycolic acid (PLGA) is a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer that has been approved by food and drug administration (FDA) [53] and extensively used in targeting the ischemic myocardium.",
        "Oduk et al. encapsulated VEGF within PLGA NPs (113 nm) to provide a sustained release manner for at least 31 days. A low dose of VEGF was used to avoid its associated side effects as hypotension, retinopathy or any other safety concerns. Using a murine myocardial infarction model, the nanoparticles were injected into the peri-infarct region where the VEGF promoted revascularization of ischemic myocardium, reduced the size of infarct and improved left ventricular contractility. Thus, this was considered as a novel approach for cardiac regeneration [44, 45]. Mao et al. also formulated PLGA NPs loaded with pitavastatin to target inflammatory cells within ischemic myocardium. The delivered drug coordinated the recruitment and mobilization of monocyte/macrophage to the diseased myocardium. Thus, it reduced the excessive prolonged inflammation that exagerates the fibrosis leading to left ventricular dilation and thinning subsequently, causing heart failure. Therefore, it was considered as a clinically feasible nanosystem to reduce post infarction fibrosis and decrease incidence of poor prognostic heart failure [54].",
        "Some research results have demonstrated the ability of some natural products to promote the inherited mechanism of cardiac regeneration through enhancing angiogenesis, preventing cardiomyocyte apoptosis besides increasing the migration, proliferation and differentiation rate of progenitor cells into cardiac ones [55]. The application of nanomedicine can minimize the limitations accompanied by use of natural products as poor solubility, limited bioavailability and rapid degradation rate. Nabofa et al. encapsulated two natural products;curcumin and nisin within biodegradable PLGA NPs. Curcumin is a polyphenol with cardioprotective potential attributed to antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. Nisin is an antimicrobial peptide that was combined with curcumin to reduce cardiac related defects. The cardioprotective potential of formulated system was tested using isoproterenol-induced MI guinea pig model. The histological examination showed that the pretreatment of guinea pigs with CurNisNPs before induction of infarction prevented necrosis and increase in myofibril thickness. In addition, the oxidative stress markers were reduced, thus CurNisNPs increased the cardiac antioxidant defense [56].",
        "Jing and Chen et al. selected Wogonin; a flavonoid with cardioprotective properties and loaded it within PLGA NPs. Using an isoproterenol-induced MI rat model, the formulation was given orally as a pretreatment for 21 days and several investigations were conducted to examine the cardioprotection efficacy. The treated rats showed a significant decrease in infarct size compared to untreated rats. In addition, edema and necrosis were reduced. Moreover, the levels of different cardiac proteins as Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Creatine kinase -MB (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin-T (cTn T) were decreased [57].",
        "Bejerano et al. explored the possibility of using microRNA-based therapy to target post-infarction cardiac macrophage and switch their phenotype from inflammatory to reparative manner, thus promoting cardiac healing. They formulated polymeric NPs spontaneously formed due to the complexation of hyalournan -sulfate with miRNA-21 through calcium ion bridges yielding anionic particles with average size of 130 nm. This system promoted angiogenesis, decreased the rate of cardiomyoctes apoptosis and reduced left ventricular remodelling post-infarction [58].",
        "Boarescu et al. also examined the cardioptotective potential of curcumin loaded polymeric nanoparticles using acute myocardial infarction model in diabetic rats. The curcumin was chosen due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects in addition to reduction of necrosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes [59]. Curcumin nanoparticles showed cardioprotective effects manifested by the prevention of cardiac enzymes elevation and oxidative stress markers [60, 61].",
        "The metal nanoparticles have been also used in the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases due to their distinct electrical and visual properties. Their small size that ranges from 10 to 100 nm enables them to interact well with cells. Their cardioprotective effect has been reported through various mechanisms of action [62]. The metal NPs possess anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertrophic, anti-oxidant properties and protect against myocardial damage. Their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduces the oxidative stress. This oxidative stress damages the cells, therefore the ability of metal NPs to enter cells and reduce ROS, eventually decreases the apoptosis rate. The toxicity profile of metal NPs is dependent on many factors as size, shape, method of preparation and charge. More intense research is required to investigate the potential toxicity of these NPs. In addition, different NPs coatings can affect their toxicities [63].",
        "Tian et al. formulated polyethylene glycol coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, 10 nm) to evaluate their effect in acute MI. AuNPs tend to accumulate within infarcted myocardium. The infarction model was induced using coronary ligation surgery and the nanoparticles were intravenously given for 7 days after recovery from surgery. The echocardiohraphy showed the ability of AuNPs to preserve left ventricular wall integrity and reduce its dilatation in addition to improving the systolic function. Moreover, the histological examination revealed a decrease in infact size in the treated groups. The AuNPs did not decrease the cardiomyocytes apoptosis rate, however they reduced the adverse cardiac fibrosis and decreased the excessive inflammation [64].",
        "Lipid nanoparticles are biocompatible, affordable and can be easily formulated. They are good candidates for passive targeting by adjusting size, polarity and membrane rigidity. They have been extensively studied in the field of cancer treatment, and they represent promising candidates for tageting the infarcted heart [65].",

It was reported that Baicalin can reduce the MI through their antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties. The formulated nanosystems were accumulated within ischemic myocardium and significantly reduced the infarct size induced by coronary artery permanent ligation animal model [66].",
        "Allijn et al. formulated pegylated liposomes (110 nm) loaded with Berberine. This natural product was selected due to its antiinflammatory, antioxidative and cardioprotective properties in addition to its ability in improving cardiac function. The pegylation aimed to increase circulation time of liposomes. Myocardial infarction was induced in mice by surgical permanent ligation of coronary artery. The formulations and free drug was administered intravenously. The distribution of liposomes was visualized and confirmed accumulation of liposomes within infarcted myocardium. The berberine liposomes significantly preserved left ventricle ejection fraction, decreased the deterioration in contractility, reduced hypertrophy and adverse cardiac remodeling.

Cyclic arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid (RGD) is a peptide that has good affinity to αvβ3 integrin receptors, thus it can be used as targeting peptide to deliver cardioprotective cargo to the infarction.",

        "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a cardiac hormone that regulates blood pressure by stimulating vasodilation in addition to its anti-hypertrophic properties [74]. It can be used as a targeting ligand to the infarcted heart where its receptors are overexpressed, however they are also present in other tissues as kidneys, lungs, brain, testes, adipose tissue, adrenal gland tissues and vascular smooth muscle cells [75]. In order to potentiate the targeting capability of ANP, it is sometimes combined with triphenylphenylphosphonium (TPP). TPP cations can cross passively the lipid bilayer and accumulate within mitochondria due to its high negative membrane potential [76].",
        "Jie Wang et al. decorated a Baicalin lipid-polymer nanoparticle with dual ligands; ANP and TPP. The LPN sustained the release of Baicalin and the decorated system exhibited a slower release manner due to presence of ligands. The ANP/TPP LPN system did not induce any cytotoxicity upon human cardiac myocytes (HCM). A biodistribution study illustrated that ANP/TPP-BN-LPNs showed the highest accumulation within heart compared to single ligand nanoparticle, unmodified system (LPN) and drug solution. Moreover, it fulfilled the maximum reduction in infarct size and achieved the best therapeutic outcome compared to other nanoparticles and drug solution [77].",

These calcium nanoparticles were pH-responsive that selectively released the drug at acidic inflammation sites. Using an in vivo MI animal model, the colchicine calcium nanoparticles that were injected into caudal vein after ligation of coronary artery achieved a better reduction in infarct size compared to drug solution. In addition, colchicine calcium nanoparticles reduced several inflammatory cytokines as TNF-α and CRP that are elevated during MI [81].",
        "Bioinspired nanoparticles mimicking lipoproteins Formulation of biomimetic nanoparticles that resemble naturally occuring nanoparticles as lipoproteins can be considered as a promising approach for targeting cardiovascular disorders as MI. Lipoproteins are endogenous carriers of fats and cholesterol within the blood stream. These fats and lipids are hydrophobic, forming complexes with proteins called lipoprotein to facilitate their transportation through circulation. These lipoproteins are classified into various classes based on their size and denisty; chylomicrons, very low denisty protein (vLDL), low denisty lipoprotein (LDL) and high denisty lipoprotein (HDL). Chylomicrons and vLDL transport triglycerides while LDL and HDL transport cholesterol where LDL transports cholesterol from liver to different body tissues, while HDL transports cholesterol from body tissues to liver. LDL and HDL have emerged out as promising drug delivery vehicles. LDL is composed of an internal core of cholestryl esters and triglycerides surrounded by an outer monolayer of phospholipid decorated with apoprotein B (apoB). The apoproteins are responsible for receptor recognition, where LDL particles are recognized by LDL receptors (LDLR). HDL is also composed of a hydrophobic core composed of cholesterol ester and triglycerides coated with a hydrophilic layer of phospholipid and apoprotein A1 [82]. HDL is recognized by certain receptors as Scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) and ATP Binding Cassette Type A and Class 1 (ABCA1). HDL is commonly known as good cholesterol, it possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative characteristics [83].",
        "In some neoplastic disorders, the increased need for cholesterol required by rapidly dividing cells leads to the overexpression of lipoprotein receptors as LDLR and SR-B1. Similarily after a MI episode, the demand for cholesterol increases to synthesize new cell membrane for newly formed scar tissue or myocardial fibers implicating an overexpression in lipoprotein receptors. de Lima et al. [84] reported that repairing the cardiac dysfunction and inflammation is accompanied by overexpression of LDLR. In addition, SR-B1 is also expressed upon several inflammatory and proliferative cells that are recrutied to the infarcted area as monocytes, leukocytes [85] and macrophages. Therefore, utilizing LDL and HDL as transport vehicles can be promising to target and repair the infarcted myocardium.",
        "The isolation of natural LDL and HDL from fresh donor plasma is expensive, laborious and problematic. The obtained amount is limited, in addition the samples vary from batch to batch. Moreover, the isolated lipoproteins are only valid for limited periods before being subjected to aggregation and degradation. Therefore, various studies and attempts aim to prepare synthetic LDL and HDL-mimicking particles. They are mainly composed of phospholipid/cholesterol esters microemulsion prepared by certain ratios in addition to the appropriate apoprotein. However, obtaining the apoprotein from the donor plasma is also problematic owing to its size and complex nature. Alternative approaches have been developed to replace the use of natural apoproteins by synthesizing artificial apoprotein-like peptides [86]. Moreover, another approach was studied that mainly depends on formulation of protein-free microemulsion (LDE) whose lipid phase resembles that of native LDL. Upon injection, these particles acquire several exchangeable apoproteins from the circulation allowing their binding to lipoprotein receptors [87, 88].",
        "Raul c Maranhão et al. reported the formulation of LDE whose composition resembles that of LDL loaded with methotrexate (MTX). It was postulated that the prepared system can acquire Apo-E and interact with LDLR. An in vivo experiment was carried out in which the MI was induced by occlusion of left coronary artery. The LDE-MTX decreased the infarction size and improved the left ventricle systolic function compared to the limited effect of crude unloaded MTX [89].",
        "Richart et al. extracted human Apo AI from donor plasma which was utilized to form a complex with phosphatidylcholine to mimic the natural HDL particles. An in vivo study using a myocardial infarction animal model induced through surgical occlusion of left coronary artery illustrated the preferential accumulation of apo AI nanoparticles within ischemic tissue. In addition, the apo AI nanoparticles reduced the infarct size due to its antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effect [85].",
        "Exosomes (30–150 nm) have attracted attention as cell free bioinspired approach in cardiac regeneration. Exosomes can be derived from human or plant origin, however the human derived exosomes are more established in terms of characterization and analysis. Stem cells derived exosomes have been extensively studied for myocardial repair due to angiogenic and antiapoptotic properties [90]. They are considered as innate carriers that can deliver small molecules as proteins, nucleic acids and drugs. They exert a paracrine effect on infarcted myocardium and play an important role in its protection [91].",

It was reported that combining the MSCs with lipid lowering drug as atorvastatin can improve cardiac function for patients with coronary diseases. Using a surgically induced MI model, exosomes were intramyocardially injected into border zone of infarcted heart. Exosomes derived from atorvastatin pretreated MSCs significantly improved systolic function and decreased scar size compared to control exosomes and untreated animals. In addition, they enhanced angiogenesis and suppressed fibrosis. The atorvastatin treatment enhanced beneficial effects of control exosomes [92].",

        "The ability of biopolymers to form an extracellular like matrix can be successfully utilized to improve cardiac regeneration post MI. These scaffolds can provide support to the damaged left ventricular wall of infarcted myocardium and improve the remodelling process [96, 97]. The cardiac tissue engineering approaches include combining the biomaterials with cells or more recently using the biomaterials alone to recruit cells to the damaged areas. Moreover, these biomaterials can be loaded with different growth factors, drugs, natural products and nanoparticles to potentiate the regenerative potential of the administered system. The biomaterials scaffolds are classified into cellular/acellular cardiac patches and injectable materials. The implantation of cardiac patches is invasive as it requires open chest surgery to be sutured to the epicardial surface of the heart. Therefore, injectable biomaterials represent a better alternative as it requires a minimally invasive administration route [98].

They can be either synthetic as poly(N-isopropyla crylamide) (PNIPAAM) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or naturally derived as fibrin, collagen, matrigel and chitosan. Recently, incorporation of various nanoparticles, nanotubes and nano-fibers within hydrogel was introduced to form hydrogel-based nano-composites. The addition of nano-formulations as gold nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes with injectable biomaterial enhanced angiogenesis, adhesion of recruited cells and electrical conductivity [99]. Moreover, combining nanoparticles and hydrogel can augment the therapeutic outcome. Rocker et al. reported the formulation of sulfonated gel incorporating VEGF, IL-10 and platelet derived growth factor loaded micelles. The formulated system showed a favourable sustained release of loaded cargo and significant increase in angiogenesis process [100].Moreover, nanobiomaterials such as nano-gels prepared from polymeric nanomaterial can be also used as an injectable biomaterial [101].Generally, the use of nanotechnology can enhance the physical properties of biomaterials augmenting its therapeutic effect. Thus, these injectable hydrogel-based nano-composites can be used as cell-free approaches to support the left ventricle, reduce negative remodelling and control the delivery of various cargos to ischemic myocardium.",
        "Chen et al. formulated a new conductive hydrogel enriched with gold nanorods and nanoformulated Astragaloside IV(AST). The injectable hydrogel was composed of the hyperbranched poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate/4-vinylphenylboronic acid (PEG-PBA) and thiolated hyaluronic acid (HA-SH). Upon injection, hydrogel exhibited good fluidity and was delivered via intramyocardial injection, then it was gelatinized invivo avoiding invasive surgeries. The gold nanorods improved conductivity of the system and promoted proliferation of cells. The AST is a natural product with anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties, where its poor properties were improved by being nanoformulated. The hydrogel was injected into rats that were subjected to surgical ligation of coronary artery to induce infarction. The hydrogel treatment reduced fibrosis, downregulated apoptosis rate and decreased ventricular remodeling [102].",
        "Nowadays, it is well accepted that the therapy of MI should target cardiomyocyte loss in order to improve patients' prognoses and reduce MI-induced heart failure. Current therapeutic approaches which include surgical interventions or pharmacological agents are not considered as curative treatment. Cardiomyocytes cannot regenerate after necrotic or apoptotic events, and a fibrous tissue eventually forms, reducing myocardial contractility. This has sparked significant interest in cardiac regeneration therapy.",
        "Cell-based regenerative therapy has been widely reported for more than fifty years. However, introducing a commercial cell therapy product has faced major obstacles as cost, regulatory issues and strategic buisness considerations. For cell therapy to be clinically translated, enormous expenses are required in order to combine efficient bioprocessing techniques and scale up approaches which can not be implemented at a cost that the society can afford. Thus, healthcare officials find it a significant burden, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, cell therapy requires evaluation of several factors as cell source, isolation and differentiation methods in addition to purity and potency analysis. It also faces major safety concerns including undesirable in-vivo cell differentiation, migration and tumourigenicity. Recent theories have attributed positive results of cell based therapies to paracrine mechanism. Notably, some studies reported improvement in cardiac repair after administration of cell therapy despite low survival and engrafment rates. Thus, a new mechanism was proposed postulating that the cells secrete cytoprotective factors that contribute to myocardial healing after an ischemic insult. Subsequently, more research interest has been shifted towards cell-free approaches for cardiac regeneration.",
        "Exosomes have attracted attention and augmented the concept of cell-free therapies owing to their biocompatability and target specificity. Exosomes can contribute to the healing of ischemic insult post infarction through modulation of inflammation, fibrosis and angiogenesis. Obtaining patient`s own exosomes renders it more biocompatible and less immunogenic. However, exosomes are biological products that face some challenges as isolation methods. They are mainly isolated according to vesicle size. It was reported that exosomes may contain different products exerting different therapeutic outcomes according to the microenvironment, thus more accurate isolation techniques are required. In addition, they suffer from instability and low retention rates after in vivo administration. Moreover, they need standard operating procedures (SOP) for large-scale isolation and purification. The emergence of exosomes as a successful bioinspired cell-free approach in cardiac regeneration has given an opportunity to introduce more nanoparticles-based strategies capable of targeting infarcted myocardium. Interestingly, these nanoformulations can be prepared and characterized overcoming the challenges associated with isolating and evaluating a biological product. Moreover, these nanoparticles can be designed to target myocardium using different passive or active targeting approaches. These nanoformulations can be loaded with affordable drugs, growth factors or natural products with reported cardioptotective properties. Natural products offer a reservoir of bioactive compounds that can play an integral role in cardiac repair. By optimizing the formulation and surface functionalization of these nanoparticles, we can achieve targeted delivery to the injured heart tissue, enhancing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects. The translation of these nanotechnological advancements into clinical applications holds immense potential. By addressing the limitations of current therapies, such as limited bioavailability and off-target effects, these nanocarriers can offer a more effective and safer approach to cardiac repair. Additionally, the integration of nanotechnology with tissue engineering techniques using injectable biomaterials can further accelerate the development of regenerative therapies for heart disease.",

We hypothesized that tissue-engineered skeletal myoblast (SMB) constructs may be preserved by vitrification to conserve biological function and structure. RESULTS: Scaffold-free cardiac cell-sheet constructs were prepared from SMBs and immersed in a vitrification solution containing ethylene glycol, sucrose, and carboxyl poly-L-lysine. The cell sheet was wrapped in a thin film and frozen rapidly above liquid nitrogen to achieve vitrification (vitrification group, n = 8); fresh, untreated SMB sheets (fresh group, n = 8) were used as the control. The cryopreserved SMB sheets were thawed at 2 days, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after cryopreservation for assessment. Thawed, cryopreserved SMB sheets were transplanted into rat hearts in a myocardial infarction nude rat model, and their effects on cardiac function were evaluated. Cell viability in the cardiac constructs of the vitrification group was comparable to that of the fresh group, independent of the period of cryopreservation (p > 0.05). The structures of the cell-sheet constructs, including cell-cell junctions such as desmosomes, extracellular matrix, and cell membranes, were maintained in the vitrification group for 3 months. The expression of cytokine genes and extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, collagen I, N-cadherin, and integrin alpha5) showed similar levels in the vitrification and fresh groups.

        "Regenerative therapy using skeletal myoblast (SMB) sheets has been used experimentally to treat patients with heart failure, and its safety, feasibility, and potential efficacy have been demonstrated in clinical studies [1–5]. However, the application of regenerative therapy in the clinical setting is limited, owing to the need for an in-hospital cell processing center with an aseptic environment and the time-consuming protocols for preparing cell constructs. A resource stock of cell sheets for implantation would thus facilitate the wide application and industrialization of tissue implantation therapy. Nevertheless, a crucial challenge for the widespread adoption of cell sheet implantation is the development of an optimized method for the preservation of cell sheets that maintains their viability and regenerative function.",
        "One established technique for cell preservation is the slow-freezing method using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) [6, 7]. As temperature decreases, extracellular water freezes producing high osmotic pressure outside the cell, leading to dehydration and shrinkage. Because this osmotic pressure causes water molecules to move out of and freeze outside cells, intracellular ice formation is efficiently prevented. However, if the temperature decreases too rapidly, water molecules may not move outside the cells quickly enough, potentially leading to the formation of ice crystals inside the cells, damaging the cell membranes [8–10].",
        "In contrast, the high concentration of cryoprotectant and extremely fast cooling rates in vitrification provide no time for the intra- and extracellular water to form ice crystals [11, 12]. Vitrification is applied to the preservation of many cell lines. According to previous reports, the function of tissues such as blood vessels is maintained after vitrification [13, 14]. In particular, vitrification is commonly used for preserving embryos in the clinical setting [15, 16]. Moreover, chondrocyte sheets reportedly maintain high viability after vitrification, which has thus been suggested for clinical use [17]. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated whether vitrification could be used to preserve skeletal cell sheets in an implantable shape and with high potential to induce cytokine paracrine effects.",
        "The vitrification method is illustrated in Fig. 1a.

        "Histological analyses, including HE staining and TEM, revealed that vitrified cells were dense and the ECM was intact with abundant, well-preserved desmosomes, similar to those in fresh cell sheets. Immunostaining and western blot analyses revealed that ECM-related proteins such as fibronectin, collagen I, and N-cadherin were expressed at the same levels in the basement membrane of the cells in the vitrification-preserved cell and fresh cell sheets. Integrin α5 was also expressed on the cell membranes of both types of cell sheets. Furthermore, mitochondrial cristae density and volume were similar in the vitrification-preserved and fresh cell sheets, whereas mitochondrial function appeared to be reduced after cryopreservation as determined by mitochondrial- related gene expression data. The potential for cytokine paracrine effects, a crucial parameter for clinical applications, was prominent in the cell sheets preserved by vitrification, and was comparable to that of the fresh cell sheets in the in vitro study. The same levels of functional improvement and histological recovery were observed in vivo after transplantation of the cell sheets in an MI rat model.",
        "In the established DMSO-based slow-freezing method for cell preservation [6, 7], small ice crystals form outside cells when the external temperature is below the freezing point, causing damage to the cell membrane in some cases. Additionally, the osmotic pressure outside the cell is high, leading to dehydration and shrinkage (Fig. 7). If shrinkage is excessive, the cell membrane is completely destroyed by distortion. Moreover, it has been reported that cell-cell junctions and the ECM of organs and tissues are destroyed by slow freezing (Fig. 7). It is particularly difficult to maintain homeostasis using this method for functional applications [18–20].Fig. 7Effect of vitrification on the in vivo cardiac function of transplanted cell sheets. (Top) During slow freezing of single cells, the osmotic pressure outside the cell is high, leading to dehydration and shrinkage. If the shrinkage is excessive, the cell membrane is completely destroyed by distortion, thus causing cell death in some cases. (Middle) During slow freezing of cell sheets, a phenomenon similar to that observed in single cells occurs. It has also been reported that cell-cell junctions and the ECM of cell sheets are destroyed by ice crystal formation. (Bottom) Vitrification instantaneously brings the inside and outside of the cell to an extremely low temperature, leaving no time for intra- and extracellular water to form ice crystals. Shrinkage and membrane destruction also do not occur. Therefore, as the ECM and cell membranes are preserved, the structure is better maintained",

Shrinkage and membrane destruction also do not occur. Therefore, as the ECM and cell membranes are preserved, the structure is better maintained",
        "Vitrification avoids these problems [11, 12]. This method instantaneously brings both the inside and outside of the cell to an extremely low temperature, leaving no time for intra- and extracellular water to form ice crystals. In addition, there is no migration of water molecules between the internal and external environments of the cell; thus, shrinkage and membrane destruction do not occur (Fig. 7). Accordingly, as the ECM and cell membranes are preserved, the structure and function are better maintained.",
        "In addition to the ECM, another crucial factor for the preservation of cell sheet structure and function is the ability to effectively maintain the activity of enzymes controlling ECM synthesis and degradation [21–26]. In general, enzyme activity tends to decline in proportion to the decrease in temperature [27]. Proteolytic enzymes may show some activity at temperatures below − 30 °C, suggesting that a cell sheet should be preserved at below − 30 °C or − 40 °C to completely stop enzyme activity. Because the storage temperature for the vitrification method is − 196 °C, we supposed that enzymes related to ECM metabolism, such as matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, would become inactivated during vitrification. This may explain the preservation of the shape and function of the cell sheet structure when using the vitrification method.",
        "Several cytokines secreted from cell sheets, especially HGF, play crucial roles in functional angiogenesis, which led us to examine the HGF expression level in an in vitro study. HGF expression was found to be significantly higher in the vitrification group than in the fresh group. As the cell viability was lower in the vitrification group than in the fresh group, we expected that HGF expression would accordingly show a decrease. Notably, the cell sheet preserved by vitrification instead showed higher cytokine expression levels than the fresh sheet. One possible explanation for this result is that the vitrification-preserved cell sheet might be under more stress than the fresh sheet owing to various factors, such as hypoxia or ice crystal injury. Damage or injury caused by such stress may enhance the cytokine paracrine response to protect the cells against apoptosis [28–30]. We thought that immediately after thawing, the cell sheet is in a state similar to ischemia and malnutrition, and that transcription of HGF, VEGF, SDF1 was promoted (Fig. 4a-c). Conversely, HGF showed high protein expression while VEGF and SDF1 showed low protein expression (Fig. 4d-f). We thought that HGF was translated immediately after transcription, and that protein expression was promoted. On the other hand, we thought that the translation of VEGF and SDF increased with time after transplantation.",
        "It is known that VEGF is promoted downstream of HGF, and that VEGF and SDF are promoted downstream of HIF 1, which is increased by ischemia [31–33]. Therefore, we believe that there was a delay before VEGF and SDF reached a sufficient expression level, when compared to HGF. It was also considered that the rates of transcription and translation of each molecule were different. In any case, the cell sheet viability was maintained before and after vitrification (Fig. 1d). In the in vivo experiments, it was also observed that cardiac function improvement in the vitrification group was the same as that in the fresh group (Figs. 5 and 6). Therefore, it was considered that the levels of angiogenesis-promoting factors like VEGF and SDF increased with time after transplantation and contributed to the improvement of cardiac function.",
        "It can be reasoned that vitrification causes some cellular damage or a decrease in cell viability because of cell shrinkage, owing to the substantial gap in osmotic pressure between the internal and external environment of the cells when the sheets are immersed in the protective vehicle. Injury might also occur during the removal of the protective vehicle after thawing. It may be possible to minimize such injury by gradually increasing the concentration of the protective vehicle during immersion of the cell sheet.",
        "Although there was no significant difference, viability slightly decreased before and after vitrification. As the vitrification method instantly vitrifies the cells, it is unlikely that cells would be damaged by the formation of ice crystals. Instead, damage likely occurred through the formation of ice crystals when the frozen cells were thawed. To avoid this potential issue, we attempted to thaw the cryopreserved cell sheet using a hot plate but we were unable to exclude the possibility that ice crystals were generated by recrystallization [34, 35]. It may be possible to improve the cell viability by devising a more appropriate thawing method, e.g., by directly placing cell sheets in water at 37 °C to allow them to thaw rapidly.",
        "Although cell viability in the cell sheets was lower in the vitrification group than in the fresh group, the improvement in cardiac function and angiogenesis was highly similar in both groups. Promotion of angiogenesis by cytokines, such as HGF and VEGF secreted from the cell sheet, has been demonstrated in our previous studies [1–5]. These findings suggest that the cell sheets maintain angiogenic function even after vitrification.",
        "Myoblast cell sheets for clinical applications are generally prepared in two steps. The first step is to culture a large number of myoblasts for 2–3 weeks, followed by vitrification and preservation in liquid nitrogen (−196 °C). The second step is to prepare a cell sheet in a cell processing center where its quality is maintained for 2 days prior to the operation. Such centers are costly to establish and maintain. The method developed in the present study does not require a cell processing center in each hospital to produce cell sheets, which would substantially reduce the costs of cell sheet preparation and accordingly broaden the clinical application potential of cell sheet therapy.",
        "Our results demonstrate the possibility of preserving the quality of cell sheets for at least 3 months after vitrification without deterioration, enabling the manufacture and dissemination of high-quality cell sheets to any hospital worldwide. Furthermore, this technology may be applicable to cell sheets derived from other cell types, such as induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. It is unlikely that the deterioration of the cell sheet will progress over time, because intracellular metabolism is nearly completely stopped at ultra-low temperatures. In the future, it will be necessary to verify the preservation for longer durations to establish the versatility of the method.",
        "Vitrification preserves the functionality and structure of scaffold-free cardiac cell-sheet constructs of human SMBs after thawing. This method may facilitate the widespread application of cell sheet therapy in clinical settings.",
        "Cell sheets were prepared as previously reported [36, 37]. In brief, myoblast cells were purified from 10 to 20 g of vastus medialis muscle procured from patients with heart failure (n = 8; age, 30–74 years [average, 56.9 years]; male:female = 6:2). The cells were suspended in skeletal muscle cell basal medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) with fetal bovine serum (Moregate Biotech, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia), epidermal growth factor (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), gentamicin (Fuji Pharma, Tokyo, Japan), and amphotericin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% carbon dioxide until the required number of cells was obtained; further passages were performed if needed. SMBs were collected and cultured on temperature-responsive culture dishes [38] (UpCell; Cell-seed, Tokyo, Japan) at a density of 1 × 106 cells/cm2 at 37 °C for 1 day, and the cell sheets were detached from the dishes at room temperature (20–25 °C). For animal experiments, cell sheets were produced at a density of 3 × 106 cells/sheet.",
        "SMBs were prepared as scaffold-free cell sheets using temperature-responsive culture dishes (1 × 106 cells/cm2), as described above. The cell-sheet construct was detached from the dish at 22 °C and then immersed in protective vehicle containing 6.5 M ethylene glycol, 0.7 M sucrose, and 10% carboxyl poly-l-lysine without serum (Stem Cell Keep; Bio Verde, Kyoto, Japan) for 5 min [39]. The cell-sheet construct was covered with polypropylene mesh sheets (TiLane mesh; Medical Leaders, Tokyo, Japan), which are clinically used and served as a substrate for the cell sheet. The cell-sheet construct with the mesh was packaged between thin polyethylene films (Hybri-Bag Soft; COSMO BIO, Tokyo, Japan), which can endure ultra-low temperature. The protective vehicle and air were pressed out of the package as much as possible. The packaged cell sheet was held 1 cm above a liquid nitrogen surface for 5 min for vitrification (Fig. 1a) [17], placed in a vitrification container, and then preserved beneath the liquid nitrogen for 2 days, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months for assessment.",
        "A hot plate was set at 37 °C. A thermal insulation gel was placed on the hot plate and warmed for 10 min. A cell sheet was taken from the liquid nitrogen tank and placed immediately on the hot plate. The gel was placed on top of the cell sheet to thaw it rapidly. Next, each side of the package was cut, and the film was removed. The cell-sheet construct with mesh was immersed in Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ to remove the protective vehicle. After removal of the mesh, the cell sheet was analyzed.",
        "Cell viability was evaluated by cell counting using Trypan blue. In brief, cell sheets were immersed in 500 μL of TrypLE Select (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 400×g for 5 min and the supernatant was removed. Single cells were washed with 500 μL of Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (HBSS(+)). The suspension was centrifuged at 400×g for 5 min and the supernatant was removed. Cells were suspended in 100 μL HBSS (+) and stained with Trypan blue. The number of viable cells and the number of dead cells were counted using a microscope to calculate the viability.",
        "Male nude rats (F344/NJcl-rnu/rnu (CLEA Japan, Inc.); 8–10 weeks of age) underwent left coronary artery ligation as previously described [37, 40]. The rats were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane and placed on a respirator during surgery to maintain ventilation. After 2 weeks, echocardiography was performed to evaluate the extent of MI, and rats with an EF greater than 30% and less than 50% were used as MI model rats. The MI model rats were randomly divided into three treatment groups: a fresh group (cell sheets used without further treatment, n = 11), vitrification group (n = 11), and sham-operation group (n = 10). The cell sheets were transplanted onto the infarct area in the fresh and vitrification groups. In the sham-operation group, rats were subjected to thoracotomy, and the chest was closed without transplantation. The effect of the transplantation of various sheets on cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography, including estimates of the EF, FS, ΔLVDd, ΔLVDs, and ΔIVSd at 2 and 4 weeks after transplantation. The rats were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane to alleviate suffering and the hearts were quickly procured to determine the extent of fibrosis of the left ventricle (%), the length of the minor axis of the cells (μm), and the number of microvessels (per mm2).",
        "Cell sheets and heart ventricles of nude rats were immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm sections using a microtome. The sections were stained with HE or SR and assessed by optical microscopy [36, 41].

This study investigates the role of circALPK2, a circular RNA derived from the back-splicing of the 4th exon of alpha protein kinase 2 (ALPK2), in regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation and its therapeutic efficacy in myocardial infarction (MI) treatment. METHODS: Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) were used to assess the expression and function ofcircALPK2. Lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown of circALPK2 was performed in hESC-CMs, followed by RNA sequencing to identify targeted genes and biological processes. The proliferative capacity of wild-type and circALPK2 knockdown hESC-CMs was evaluated using CCK-8 assay, EdU staining and RT-qPCR analysis of cell cycle-related genes. Dual luciferase assays were conducted to validate the predicted miRNA targets and their downstream effects. For in vivo evaluation, MI mice were injected with either wild-type or circALPK2 knockdown hESC-CMs, and the therapeutic potential was assessed by echocardiographic and histological analyses. RESULTS: We identified circALPK2 as a negative regulator of cell proliferation in hESC-CMs. CircALPK2 was abundantly expressed in hESC-CMs. Knockdown of circALPK2 significantly enhanced cell proliferation in hESC-CMs, as demonstrated by CCK-8 assays (p < 0.001) and EdU staining (p < 0.001), and accelerated the expression of cell cycle-related genes, including CCNA2(p < 0.05) and CDK1 (p < 0.01). Furthermore, circALPK2 was found to function as a sponge to inhibit miR-9 activity, while miR-9 mimics significantly boosted the proliferative capacity of hESC-CMs. Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3B), a key inhibitor of WNT signaling, was identified as a direct target of miR-9, mediating the regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation. Importantly, circALPK2 knockdown improved the myocardial repair potential of hESC-CMs when injected into infarcted mouse hearts, as indicated by improved left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.01) and fractional shortening (p < 0.05).

        "The inability of adult cardiomyocytes to renew after cardiac injury is a key cause of the high mortality of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which contributed to 19.05 million deaths globally in 2020 [1]. Therefore, myocardial regeneration in patients with cardiac injury is a long-sought goal in the clinical treatment of CVDs. Boosting of endogenous cardiomyocyte proliferation and transplantation of exogenous cardiomyocytes have now emerged as two appealing approaches for cardiac repair and regeneration [2, 3]. While the regenerative potential has been uncovered in mammalian newborn hearts, understanding mechanisms controlling postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation will indisputably promote the identification of novel targets for stimulating adult cardiac regeneration [4, 5]. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) represent a promising cell source for both modeling human embryonic and postnatal cardiomyocytes and developing stem cell-based regenerative therapy. Meanwhile, investigating the regulation of proliferation in hPSC-CMs will help to improve the scalability of hPSC-CM production to meet the demands of pre-clinical and clinical studies, and address low survival and engraftment rate of transplanted cells, a major hurdle for the clinical application [6].",
        "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and long ncRNAs, emerged as critical regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart development and cardiac regeneration [7]. Numerous miRNAs, such as miR-25, miR-199a, miR-204, miR-210, miR-515, miR-519e, and miR-590, have been shown to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation via the regulation of mRNA stability and translation [8–12]. In contrast, relatively fewer studies have explored the roles of circRNAs in regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation [13–15]. Mechanistically, circRNAs can act as miRNA sponges and scaffolds for RNA-binding proteins [16]. For example, circRNA Nfix was found to reduce cardiomyocyte proliferation through binding to transcription factor Ybx1 and mediating its degradation, and meanwhile inhibit angiogenesis via sponging miR-214 to promote Gsk3b (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) expression and repress β-catenin activity [13]. Despite the encouraging evidences, circRNA research, particularly in cardiac regeneration and repair, is still in its infancy.",
        "In a previous study, we revealed a dynamic expression of circRNAs during cardiac differentiation from hPSCs, including a circRNA (circALPK2) formed by circulation of the 4th exon of alpha protein kinase 2 (ALPK2) [17]. As a negative regulator of WNT signaling, ALPK2 depletion led to defective cardiogenesis in zebrafish and hPSCs [18]. However, Alpk2-knockout mice exhibited normal cardiac morphology and function [19]. Further studies are needed to address the rationale for the phenotypic differences between species. Given its specific expression in the human heart and hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, we speculate circALPK2 might also be involved in human cardiogenesis, which would further complicate the regulatory network.",
        "In the current study, by using human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and myocardial infarction mice models, we demonstrated that circALPK2 is a negative regulator of cardiomyocyte proliferation and myocardial repair. Mechanistically, circALPK2 can serve as a sponge of miR-9 to relieve its inhibitory effect on the expression of GSK3B, ultimately inhibiting the WNT signaling pathway that is crucial for cardiomyocyte proliferation. Finally, the knockdown of circALPK2 enhances the myocardial repair capacity of hESC-CMs when injected into the infarcted mouse heart.",
        "Experiments involving human cells were approved by the Ethics Committee of First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (No. 2022 − 519).

Female mice (8 weeks old) were used in this study due to their better survival rates following myocardial infarction and to eliminate gender influence on heart function. A total of 28 mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 7 for each group), including the sham-operated group (Sham), the myocardial infarction group (MI), the MI plus wild-type hESC-CM injection group (MI + CMs) and MI plus circALPK2-knockdown hESC-CM injection group (MI + sh-circALPK2-CMs). Myocardial infarction was introduced to mice under isoflurane anesthesia (4% induction, 1.5% maintenance) through ligation of the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) by an experienced microsurgeon who was blinded to the group assignments. For the latter two groups, 1 × 106 wild-type or circALPK2-knockdown hESC-CMs in PBS were injected into three sites beneath the ligation position immediately after LAD surgery. An equal volume of PBS was injected at similar positions of the infarcted mouse hearts in the MI group. The decision to perform cell injection immediately after LAD surgery was made to avoid the high mortality associated with a second thoracotomy. Post surgery, mice were recovered on the heating pad. No mice exhibited signs of pain, distress, or agitation during or after surgery, and all were included in subsequent cardiac function assessment.",

        "Human cardiomyocytes used in the current study were derived from hESCs via modulating WNT signaling in cardiac differentiation medium. After metabolic purification, hESC-CMs were used in subsequent experiments. The expression of circALPK2 in hESC-CMs was verified by PCR amplification of its back-splicing region with a pair of divergent primers. While both cDNA and genomic DNA fragments could be amplified by using the convergent primers, the divergent primers targeting the 4th exon resulted in a single amplicon with expected size in only cDNA but not genomic DNA samples (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, Sanger sequencing analysis confirmed that the single amplicon contained a back-splicing junction of the 4th exon of linear ALPK2 gene (Fig. 1C). These data verified the existence of circALPK2 in hESC-CMs.",
        "We subsequently assessed the expression of circALPK2 and its linear counterpart in different cardiac component cells, including hESC-CMs, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Unlike the linear ALPK2 showing abundant expression in both hESC-CMs and fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S1A), the expression of circALPK2 was specifically elevated in hESC-CMs (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, a significant increase of circALPK2 expression in hESC-derived cells was observed on day 4 of cardiac differentiation, corresponding to the cardiac progenitor cell stage (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The abundance of circALPK2 continuously rises in hESC-CMs throughout cardiac differentiation from days 0 to 9, and remains elevated during the culture period from days 9 to 30 (Supplementary Fig. S1B), a stage during which hESC-CMs gradually lose their proliferative capacity and become more mature. The linear ALPK2 mRNAs showed a similar expression trend with circALPK2 during cardiac differentiation (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Although ALPK2 is involved in cardiogenesis, the role of circALPK2 in cardiomyocytes is still unclear.",
        "In order to uncover its biological functions, circALPK2 was knocked down in hESC-CMs by lentiviral shRNAs directly targeting its back-splice junction without affecting its linear counterpart ALPK2 (Fig. 1E). We first profiled the gene expression signatures of control and circALPK2-depleted hESC-CMs and identified 186 genes (fold change > 2, padj < 0.05) showing significantly differential expression (Fig. 1F and G, Supplementary Table 2). GO (gene ontology) analysis showed that the significantly enriched biological processes include cell division and mitotic cell cycle (Fig. 1H). Consistently, RT-qPCR data showed significantly decreased expression of cell cycle-related genes such as CCNA2 and CDK1 in circALPK2-defective hESC-CMs (Fig. 1I). Thus, we hypothesized that circALPK2 was associated with cardiomyocyte proliferation.",
        "We next analyzed the proliferative capacity of hESC-CMs after circALPK2 interference. CCK-8 assay showed that the knockdown of circALPK2 led to a significant improvement in cardiomyocyte proliferation (Fig. 1J). Meanwhile, we also found a significant increase in the ratio of EdU-positive cells in hESC-CMs subjected to circALPK2 deletion (Fig. 1K and L). In summary, circALPK2 has an anti-proliferative effect on human cardiomyocytes.",
        "Since circRNAs have the potential to act as miRNA sponges, we used miRcode (http://www.mircode.org/) to predict the target miRNAs of circALPK2, focusing on 4 candidate targets that have at least 2 binding sites, including miR-205, miR-214, miR-24, and miR-9 (Fig. 2A). However, RT-qPCR results showed that only miR-9 was upregulated in hESC-CMs by knockdown of circALPK2 (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we performed dual luciferase assay to test whether circALPK2 was able to direct target miR-9 in HEK293T cells. When either binding site was fused to the luciferase reporter gene downstream of its coding region, miR-9 mimics showed a significant inhibitory role in luciferase activity. However, once the binding sites were mutated, miR-9 mimics failed to inhibit the luciferase activity (Fig. 2C-E). These data indicate that circALPK2 could act as a sponge for miR-9.",

        "RT-qPCR data showed that the expression of GSK3B in hESC-CMs was significantly inhibited by both circALPK2 knockdown and miR-9 overexpression (Fig. 3D and E), indicating GSK3B might be a downstream target of the circALPK2/miR-9 axis. Consistently, the luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-9 mimics significantly undermined the activity of luciferase fused with the 3’-UTR of GSK3B, which was reversed by mutation of the predicted miR-9 binding site (Fig. 3F and G). These data indicated that GSK3B is a direct target of miR-9.",
        "We further determined whether inhibition of the GSK3B protein could promote cardiomyocyte proliferation, the consistent cell phenotype caused by circALPK2 depletion and miR-9 overexpression. When compared with the control group, hESC-CMs treated with CHIR, an inhibitor of GSK3B, showed more abundant expression of cell cycle genes CCNA2 and CDK1 (Fig. 4A), and a significant increase in cell proliferation activity as indicated by CCK-8 assay (Fig. 4B) and EdU staining (Fig. 4C and D). Thus, GSK3B is a potential target of the circALPK2/miR-9 axis to regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation.",

Consistent with the echocardiographic data, the relative infarct area was smaller in mice that received circALPK2-depleted hESC-CM injections compared to those that received wild-type hESC-CM injections (Fig. 5D and E). These findings were further corroborated by the expression of fibrotic markers, including αSMA and COL1A2 (Fig. 5F and G).",
        "To evaluate the retention of injected cells, we performed BLI in MI mice that received hESC-CMs engineered with a luciferase reporter, following transfection with either control or circALPK2 shRNA. Although BLI signals gradually diminished from day 1 to day 28 post-cell transplantation, they remained detectable in the hearts of mice in both groups (Fig. 5H). Notably, circALPK2 knockdown in hESC-CMs enhanced cell retention in the MI mouse hearts from day 3 onwards, as evidenced by stronger BLI signals in the circALPK2 knockdown group compared to the control group, with statistical significance at both day 14 and day 28 (Fig. 5H and I). Immunofluorescence staining, using an antibody specific to human but not mouse cTnT, was also performed on heart sections at day 7 post-transplantation. These results further confirmed the enhanced retention of hESC-CMs in MI heart in the circALPK2 knockdown group compared to the wild-type cell injections (Fig. 5J).",
        "Therefore, our data indicate that circALPK2 and its downstream targets may represent novel therapeutic targets for enhancing the retention of engrafted cells and improving the cardiac repair potential of hESC-CMs.",
        "Exploring the mechanisms controlling human cardiomyocyte proliferation has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for developing effective therapies for CVDs via activating endogenous regeneration of cardiomyocytes or enhancing the survival and engraftment rate of transplanted PSC-derived cardiomyocytes [22–24]. Previous studies have revealed the involvement of circRNAs in the physiology and pathology of CVDs, but their roles in human cardiomyocyte proliferation are still unknown [13, 17, 25–28]. In the current study, we harnessed hESC-CMs to decipher circRNA functions in human cardiomyocyte proliferation and identified circALPK2 as a negative regulator of cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac regeneration. We further reveal that circALPK2 can act as a miR-9 sponge to relieve its repressive effect on GSK3B, while the inhibition of GSK3B protein promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation.",
        "Our study indicates that the cardiomyocyte-enriched circALPK2 arises from the back-splicing of the 4th exon of its host gene ALPK2. ALPK2 depletion has been shown to impair both zebrafish heart development and cardiomyocyte differentiation from hESCs, but displays no overt cardiac phenotype in mice [18, 19]. When exploring the observed discrepancy between human and mouse models, the participation of circALPK2 may also need to be considered, in addition to the evolutionary differences of the ALPK2 protein. While the ALPK2 protein was shown to promote transitioning from mesoderm toward the cardiomyocyte lineage during cardiac differentiation [18], we first demonstrated that circALPK2 inhibited cell proliferation and cardiac repair capacity of the differentiated cardiomyocytes. These evidences indicate that the ALPK2 gene cluster might play multiple roles during cardiac development and cardiac regeneration.",
        "Interestingly, the ALPK2 protein and circALPK2 displayed similar regulatory effects on WNT signaling, a multiphasic regulator of cardiac development [29, 30]. At the earliest stages of cardiac development, ALPK2 acts as a repressor of WNT signaling to promote cardiomyocyte differentiation in both zebrafish and humans, although the detailed mechanism is still implicit [18]. In our study, we found that GSK3B, a negative regulator of WNT signaling, was positively regulated by circALPK2. Meanwhile, our data and previous results showed that GSK3B inhibitor CHIR could promote the proliferation of both hESC- and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes [30], while GSK3B overexpression could impede the circALPK2 depletion-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Thus, we believe that the ALPK2 gene cluster plays critical regulatory roles in human cardiac development and regeneration through the coordinated regulation of the WNT signaling pathway by both ALPK2 protein and circALPK2.",
        "Mechanistically, we identified miR-9 as a direct intermediary between circALPK2 and GSK3B. Although miR-9 has emerged as a versatile regulator of neurogenesis, human brain pathologies, and cancers, its role in cardiac development is largely unknown [31, 32]. In this study, we found that miR-9 mimics significantly promoted cell proliferation in hESC-CMs, extending the functional list of miR-9. Notably, miR-9 was shown to bind to both circALPK2 and GSK3B mRNA directly. The binding of miR-9 to circALPK2 will result in a downstream increase of GSK3B, ultimately leading to the inhibition of WNT activation. Our study revealed a critical role of the circALPK2/miR-9/GSK3B axis in the regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac regeneration.",
        "One limitation of this study should be considered when interpreting our results. The hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes represent immature cardiomyocytes at embryonic or fetal stages, which maintain the proliferative capacity [33]. Although the circALPK2/miR-9/GSK3B axis was shown to control cardiomyocyte proliferation and the cardiac repair ability of hESC-CMs, additional studies are required to investigate its regulatory effect on cardiac proliferation and regeneration at the adult stage.",
        "We demonstrated a negative regulatory role of circALPK2 in human cardiomyocyte proliferation via the circALPK2/miR-9/GSK3B axis, which may serve as a new target for the massive expansion of hPSC-CMs and promotion of cardiac regeneration (Fig. 6).",
        "Fig. 6CircALPK2 regulates human cardiomyocyte proliferation via the miR-9/GSK3B axis.

        "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is still a major cause of death in the world [1]. AMI consists on the cessation of blood flow, causing oxygen and nutrient supply imbalance, leading to myocardial tissue damage, with loss of cardiomyocytes (CMs). For AMI patients, the intervention of choice is immediate myocardial reperfusion with restoration of blood flow. However, this process can aggravate the damage, as the increase of molecular oxygen levels occurs at a toxic rate (ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury), contributing to up to 50% of the final scar tissue size [2]. Current treatments are successful in reducing immediate mortality but do not avoid the subsequent scarring and degeneration of myocardium tissue with loss of contractile function, often leading to chronic heart failure (CHF), a highly fatal condition in which the only available clinic option is heart transplant [3].",
        "Regenerative medicine-based strategies for infarcted myocardium include autologous and allogeneic cell therapies. Several cell types were already applied in clinical trials, including bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (e.g., REPAIR-ACS- NCT00711542, BOOST-NCT00224536), adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (e.g., ADVANCE- NCT01216995, and APOLLO- NCT00442806), and cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) (e.g., SCIPIO- NCT00474461, CADUCEUS - NCT00893360, and CAREMI- NCT02439398). For all cell types, clinical trials have demonstrated some physiological improvements but very low cell retention after some weeks, suggesting that the overall beneficial effect of transplanted cells is due to paracrine modulation rather than differentiation and functional integration in the tissue [4]. In fact, novel strategies that focused on the induction of the endogenous heart regenerative potential, such as direct growth factor administration, have shown to induce tissue regeneration by reduction of fibrosis, induction of angiogenesis, inhibition of apoptotic processes, and recruitment of endogenous CPCs [5, 6].",
        "Although in low percentages, endogenous CPCs seem to play an important regenerative role in cardiac homeostasis and in response to physiological stress and I/R injury. While the physiological alterations undergone by CMs during I/R have been extensively covered, the mechanisms by which CPCs exert their protective role are still not well defined. Upon injury, there are increased levels of signaling growth factors and cytokines released in the myocardium [7, 8]. Such signals have already been proposed to trigger CPC proliferation, differentiation, migration to the site of injury, and growth factor secretion that together have an effect on cardiomyocyte protection, reduction of inflammation, and reduction of scar tissue size, which has already been documented in several animal studies [9, 10]. Nevertheless, some doubts and controversy still exist regarding the identity and ability of CPCs to generate new CMs upon injury [11, 12]. Such concerns have recently been enhanced with the retraction of several CPC studies from Piero Anversa’s lab [13]. The hCPCs employed in this work are not the same population involved in this controversy and were isolated and cultured using a different protocol (Patent WO2014141220A1), which was also used for the isolation of the hCPC population recently evaluated for the allogeneic treatment of AMI in CAREMI clinical trial (NCT02439398). Importantly, these cells were already extensively characterized at the immunomodulatory [14–17], total proteome [18], membrane proteome [19, 20], and secretome [21] levels. The regenerative benefit of these cells was studied in vivo in pig AMI animal model [22, 23].",
        "Mainly due to the lack of relevant human models, the role of CPCs in I/R injury has been studied in vitro with murine cells. There are relevant gaps between murine and human cardiac physiology both in vitro and in vivo, such as different functionality of CM ion channels and a higher tolerability to drugs in mice and mice cells. Such differences can cause misinterpretation of the results and have already been pointed as one of the causes of high drug attrition rates [24].",
        "Aiming at filling the gap between murine and human in vitro models, in this work we have established the first in vitro human cell-based myocardial I/R injury model, using human CPCs (hCPCs) and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (hiPSC-CMs). The goal of our work is to use this co-culture model as a tool to better understand and characterize hCPC response to I/R injury, and its effect on CM death and survival upon injury. Our model was able to recapitulate important features of AMI, namely CM death, a paracrine protective effect of CPCs in CM survival, and CPC proliferation activation. For the first time, CXCL6, a cytokine with documented angiogenic properties, already identified as having an important regenerative role in both mesenteric and myocardial infarction was found to be highly secreted by hCPCs upon I/R injury in the co-culture condition. Moreover, we also demonstrated higher angiogenic potential of the co-culture supernatant upon ischemia. Human CPC whole proteome analysis showed that upon injury, and in the presence of hiPSC-CMs, there was an enrichment in proteins involved in pathways and functions related with cell proliferation, paracrine signaling, stress response, and regeneration processes when comparing to control and mono-culture conditions.",

The expression of CD26 (DPP4), recently found to be selectively upregulated in hCPCs when compared to human mesenchymal stem cells and human dermal fibroblasts (Tóran J, López J, Gomes-Alves P, et al., submitted), was also detected by immunostaining (Additional file 1: Figure S1B).",
        "During the establishment of the I/R injury setup, two different types of hiPSC-CMs were tested: (i) hiPSC-CMs differentiated as previously described [25, 26] and (ii) the same cells with an extra maturation step [27] (please see material and methods section for details). With the first hiPSC-CMs tested (without the extra maturation step), cell viability was not affected by the injury setup neither in mono-culture nor in co-culture with hCPC conditions (Additional file 2: Figure S2). These results suggest that these cells were not metabolically mature enough, not reflecting the phenotype of adult CMs found in the heart. Such results are in accordance with the findings that point to a relevant role of CM maturation stage on cell survival upon I/R injury. In fact, primary embryonic human CMs are resistant to hypoxia, while primary adult human CMs are highly dependent on an adequate oxygen supply, which might be related with the different metabolic phenotypes between the different developmental stages [32, 33]. hiPSC-CMs with an extra maturation step were therefore used in the following studies, since they better reflected the typical loss of cell viability during AMI.",

        "Moreover, several other pathways and functions relevant in I/R response were enriched in Co CPC i proteome when compared to control (Co CPC CTL) (Additional file 6: Table S1) and M CPC i (Additional file 7: Table S2), including cell proliferation via EGF-mediated pathways, pathways associated with actin filaments, with reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling (described has playing a major role in cell adaptation under stressful conditions [44]), and glycolysis. Paracrine signaling terms more enriched in Co CPC i proteome included IGF-1, HGF, VEGF, Oncostatin M, Neuregulin, Netrin, PDGF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, and IL-6 signaling pathways (Additional file 6: Table S1 and Additional file 7: Table S2), all with documented roles in myocardial I/R [45–48].",
        "Following this first comparative analysis, a more exhaustive proteomics characterization of hCPCs in the co-culture condition was carried out. Term enrichment was compared between different time points, namely in the control situations (Co CPC CTL), immediately post ischemia period (Co CPC Post I), 1 h post reperfusion (Co CPC 1 h Post R), and 16 h post reperfusion (Co CPC 16 h Post R) (Additional file 8)",
        "By analyzing the different time points, terms related with cell proliferation via EGF (EGF, cholecystokinin/gastrin-mediated and ERK5 signaling) were found as having an increasing representation along injury (Additional file 8, Category 1). FLT3 signaling was also identified as more enriched at 16 h post reperfusion, while cytokinesis (Additional file 8, Category 1) and IGF-1 signaling, also involved in cell proliferation activation [49] (Additional file 8, Category 5), were found as more enriched post ischemia. Regarding terms associated with cytoskeleton organization (Additional file 8, Category 2), cell invasion, extension, and CCR3 signaling (involved in eosinophils recruitment to inflammation sites [50]) were enriched after the ischemic period, while terms associated with cell movement were enriched at 1 h post reperfusion, suggesting an activation of hCPC migration and homing to injury in these early injury time points. Importantly, although several terms related with cell death and survival were found as less enriched in hCPCs upon ischemia, the same returned to their control levels during the reperfusion period (Additional file 8, Category 3).",
        "It is worth to mention that the cell cycle regulation pathways (Additional file 8, Category 1) and DNA repair mechanisms, including the BER pathway (Additional file 8, Category 3) representation, decreased on early injury time points and recovered to values closer to control at 16 h post reperfusion. Regarding oxidative stress, terms related with degradation and metabolism of H2O2 and HIF-1a signaling were found as more enriched in hCPCs post ischemia (Additional file 8, Category 4).",
        "IGF-1 and GM-CSF signaling was also more represented upon ischemia (Additional file 8, Category 5), while other pathways associated with cytokine/growth factor paracrine signaling and cardiac regeneration were found as more enriched in hCPCs after 16 h of reperfusion, including VEGF, Neuregulin, Oncostatin M, Jak/Stat, PDGF, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-15, and IL-22 signaling (Additional file 8, Category 5).",
        "Stress response-associated functions such as hypersensitive reaction, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), unfolded protein response (UPR), and cardiac β-adrenergic signaling were more enriched upon ischemia (Additional file 8, Category 6), while acute phase response signaling and stress response of cell representation was higher at 1 h post reperfusion. Importantly, cardiac regeneration associated functions such as cell differentiation, vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis were also found as more enriched after 16 h of reperfusion (Additional file 8, Category 6). Cysteine biosynthesis and glutathione-mediated detoxification terms, both important for protection from oxidative stress [51], were found as more enriched post ischemia (Additional file 8, Category 7). Glycolysis and oxygen consumption-related pathways was also found to be more represented upon ischemia (Additional file 8, Category 7), which might point to a compensatory mechanism to lack of oxygen availability during this phase of injury.",
        "In this study, we developed an in vitro human cellular model of myocardial I/R injury with hCPCs and hiPSC-CMs that enabled us to further decipher the action mechanisms of hCPCs upon injury. The co-culture model developed recapitulates important hallmarks of I/R injury, namely CM death, CPC proliferation activation upon insult, and the protective role of CPCs on CMs. New players on hCPC regeneration response upon I/R including activation of pathways related with cell proliferation, cytoskeleton organization, maintenance of cell integrity, stress response, paracrine signaling, cardiac regeneration, and metabolism were identified based on proteome hCPC data (Fig. 7). We also showed, for the first time, an increase in the CXCL6 secretion rate by hCPCs in an I/R setting.Fig. 7Schematic representation of proposed mechanisms involved in hCPC response to the I/R injury model, during a ischemia, b early (1 h post reperfusion), and c late (16 h post reperfusion) reperfusion phases of I/R injury",
        "Schematic representation of proposed mechanisms involved in hCPC response to the I/R injury model, during a ischemia, b early (1 h post reperfusion), and c late (16 h post reperfusion) reperfusion phases of I/R injury",
        "During the ischemic phase of injury, cells were cultured in conditions mimicking the myocardial pathophysiological state of ischemia including lack of oxygen availability, nutrient deficiency, acidosis, lactate accumulation, and hyperosmosis [28]. hCPC proteomic analysis results point to a downregulation of cell cycle regulation pathways, DNA repair mechanisms, and cell repair mechanisms during the ischemic phase of injury (Fig. 7a). In fact, downregulation of cell cycle checkpoint control and DNA repair processes has been reported as a process involved in activation of several types of quiescent adult stem cells [52]. Proteome analysis also indicates an activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, such as ERS and UPR, which have been previously associated with cellular adaptation to glucose deprivation and hypoxic stimuli [53]. Proteins associated with glycolysis and consumption of oxygen were also enriched in this time point, which might point to an adaptive response of hCPCs to the lack of O2, via an increase in the expression of protein machinery associated with energy production.",
        "The ability of CPCs to differentiate into de novo CMs upon AMI is still under active discussion, with different authors defending contrary results [11, 12, 54]. In our model, hCPCs did not label for Nkx2.5, an early marker of cardiac differentiation (results not shown) neither in CTL nor in injury conditions, although an enrichment in proteins related with cell differentiation was found in hCPCs upon the ischemic phase of injury.",
        "Although such controversy still exists regarding cardiac differentiation potential of CPCs upon injury, there is a general consensus in the field that CPCs exert a protective effect on hCMs under stress mainly due to paracrine mechanisms [37, 55], supported by extensive preclinical and clinical data indicating that transplanted CPCs do not survive neither engraft in the myocardium while physiological improvement is still registered [4]. In order to further understand the paracrine crosstalk between hCPCs and hiPSC-CMs in our model, we quantified the secretion of two key proteins: CXCL6 and IGF-1, both with documented cardiac regenerative properties. CXCL6 is an angiogenic chemokine shown to improve heart function in mice [21, 35] and identified as upregulated during mesenteric (intestinal) I/R injury [56]. This chemokine was also recently identified in the secretome of hCPCs, where addition of an anti-CXCL6 antibody inhibited the migration and angiogenic properties of CPC conditioned medium, proving the importance of this chemokine in key paracrine regenerative potential features of these cells [21]. We show for the first time an increase in the hCPC CXCL6 secretion-specific rate in a myocardial I/R injury setting, which was more pronounced during ischemia, but still significant after 16 h of reperfusion (Fig. 7a, c). These results support previous findings that show that this chemokine is upregulated in ischemic conditions via HIF-1α signaling [57]. Cardiac stem cells have been shown to home and migrate to the site of injury, a process activated by HIF-1α transcription factor and SDF-1 chemokine in response to ischemia [58]. Although CXCL6 was not identified by proteome analysis, an enrichment in proteins related to HIF-1α signaling, and CCR3 signaling, a pathway important for cell homing to inflammation and injury sites [50], was also found in hCPCs upon ischemia (Fig. 7a). Moreover, we were able to identify proteins associated with CXCR4 signaling, a pathway activated by SDF-1 with documented roles in cell motility and chemotactic response [59]. Altogether, our data and previous reports regarding CPC secretome, namely CXCL6 function, point to an effect of this chemokine in hCPC migration and angiogenesis. In fact, we also demonstrate pro-angiogenic properties of conditioned medium from the ischemic phase of injury.",
        "IGF-1 is one of the key proteins shown to be upregulated upon injury or stress by CPCs [38, 60] and CMs [46, 49] and has also been shown to have a role in the activation of hCPC regenerative potential [37, 55] and proliferation [46, 49] in vitro and in vivo. Although no significant increase in IGF-1 secretion was detected by ELISA, we registered an enrichment in IGF-signaling associated proteins in hCPC proteome upon ischemia and reperfusion time points (Fig. 7a, c). Several other proteins associated with other cytokine/growth factor paracrine signaling pathways were also found to be more represented in hCPC proteome upon ischemia, including VEGF, IL-2, IL-3, IL-15, and GM-CSF signaling, all with documented paracrine roles acting in CM physiology during I/R injury [45, 61, 62].",
        "hCPC proteome upon ischemia was also enriched in terms related with ROS metabolism, cysteine synthesis, glutamate metabolism, and glutathione-mediated detoxification (Fig. 7b). l-cysteine is one of the main precursors for glutathione, a molecule that protects cells from oxidative stress [51]. In fact, glutaminolysis, a pathway that leads to the production of glutathione via l-cysteine and glutamate, was found as a key energy source for proliferating mouse CPCs [63]. ROS formation and oxidative stress has been described as caused by the sudden oxygen elevation in the early reperfusion phase of injury [2], rather than during ischemia. However, during the preparation of the samples for proteomic analysis upon ischemia, hCPCs were briefly subjected to atmospheric oxygen concentrations, which could induce such oxidative stress responses. Together, these data point to a mechanistic response of hCPCs to ischemia phase of injury focused on a downregulation of cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair processes in favor of an enrichment in proteins associated with stress coping mechanisms, induction of cell homing and motility, and activation of pathways associated with paracrine communication including CXCL6 secretion (Fig. 7a). Such paracrine signaling activation is described as having a beneficial effect on CM protection. hCPC paracrine protection on hiPSC-CM was recapitulated in our model. Viability of hiPSC-CMs was mainly affected in the early reperfusion phase of the injury, which is consistent with the described in vivo pathophysiology of CM death during I/R, where the first minutes of reperfusion are also the main trigger for CM death and tissue damage due to the oxidative stress, calcium overload, mitochondrial permeability pore opening, and hypercontracture [2].",
        "Several authors have reported an increase in the number of resident CPC upon AMI in animal model [38, 54] hearts. Stastna et al., in 2010, also showed that connective tissue growth factor, a pro-fibrosis factor released by CMs upon AMI, induces rat CPC proliferation in vitro and atrial natriuretic peptide, a vasodilator molecule also secreted by CMs, had an opposite effect, decreasing rat CPC proliferation [64]. These results suggest that CPC proliferation is regulated upon injury by paracrine factors secreted by CMs. In fact, in our co-culture I/R injury model, we were able to observe a significant increase in hCPC proliferation upon reperfusion (Fig. 7b, c). Our hCPC whole proteome results also showed higher enrichment of pathways related with cell proliferation via EGF signaling after reperfusion, which points to EGF as one of the key actuator signals in CPC proliferation activation upon AMI (Fig. 7b, c). In fact, EGF has been reported as having a positive effect on cardiosphere-derived hCPCs proliferation and migration [65], as being one of the main factors secreted in mice CPC conditioned medium [55], as upregulated in mice CPCs upon injury [38], and EGF receptor has also been identified in a hCPC receptome characterization study by our group [19]. Other signaling pathways described to be related with cell proliferation were also found to be more enriched at 16 h post reperfusion, such as FLT3 signaling (Fig. 7c), a pathway described as important for proliferation in hematopoietic progenitor cells [66], cytokinesis, and IGF-1 pathway.",
        "Collectively, our data suggests an hCPC response to early reperfusion through activation of paracrine signaling mechanisms (including acute phase response signaling), cell proliferation, glutathione-mediated ROS detoxification, and cell movement, while still inhibiting cell cycle repair mechanisms (Fig. 7b). Later in reperfusion, hCPC proteome also demonstrated an enrichment in several pathways associated with cytokine/growth factor paracrine signaling, all with documented paracrine roles acting in CM physiology during I/R injury, including CXCL6 secretion, a recovery of cell cycle repair mechanisms, and activation of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis-related pathways (Fig. 7c). These results are in line with the concept that hCPC regenerative capacity is mainly centered on their paracrine potential, being CXCL6 one of its critical players.",
        "Our data support the importance of a paracrine crosstalk between CPCs and CMs during AMI, and the idea that heterotypic cell models better recapitulate in vivo features of I/R when compared to monotypic models.",
        "The I/R injury model developed recapitulates important hallmarks of AMI. The use of robust advanced analytical technologies such as LC-MS/MS whole cell proteome analysis, combined with more classical and targeted methodologies (ELISA growth factor quantification, viability assays) and functional assays (tube formation assay), enabled us to further understand the response of hCPC to I/R injury, shedding new insights on the possible mechanisms involved. We show, for the first time, an increase in CXCL6 secretion by hCPCs in a myocardial I/R setting, reinforcing the described role of CXCL6 in hCPC regenerative and pro-angiogenic potential and suggesting the importance of this chemokine in the paracrine-mediated protective effect of CPCs in the myocardium upon AMI. The results reported herein strengthen the importance of studying physiological processes using more complex human co-culture in vitro models leading to a better recapitulation of the in vivo paracrine signaling and a more relevant model for future applications such as drug discovery.",
        "This work provides new insights and raises new questions related with hCPC biology in acute myocardial infarction. We believe that our model provides an important tool towards a better understanding of hCPC action mechanisms upon AMI, which will enable the development of novel therapies focused on activation, recruitment, and improvement of the endogenous heart regeneration capacity.",

        "Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It occurs due to the occlusion of coronary arteries, resulting in ischemia and subsequent necrosis of myocardial tissue [1]. Despite advancements in reperfusion strategies such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thrombolysis, many patients experience progressive heart failure (HF) due to the irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes and the limited regenerative capacity of the adult myocardium [2]. Following a myocardial infarction (MI), the heart undergoes an intricate healing process characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and remodeling. Although these mechanisms are essential for immediate survival, they often lead to adverse remodeling that is characterized by ventricular enlargement and decreased contractility. The constraints of the heart's intrinsic healing systems have spurred the investigation of regenerative treatments with the goal of restoring cardiac function [3].",
        "Regenerative therapies using stem cells are at the forefront of research and clinical applications in cardiovascular disorders. These therapies aim to restore the function of damaged heart tissues, primarily through the regeneration and repair of myocardial cells. Stem cells facilitate this process by replacing damaged cells via transdifferentiation and by secreting factors including growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular vesicles that stimulate anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic responses, promoting angiogenesis and immune-stimulation in the microenvironment [4].",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are among the most studied and utilized in clinical settings due to their ability to differentiate into various cell types and their potent paracrine effects. Among MSCs, those derived from the human umbilical cords (hUC-MSCs) are particularly promising due to their high proliferative capacity and low immunogenicity [4]. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have emerged as a novel and safer alternative in regenerative medicine, have recently gained attention. EVs have been recognized as key mediators of intercellular communication, capable of delivering proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids to target cells. These vesicles have shown potential in promoting cardiac repair by enhancing cell survival, reducing fibrosis, and stimulating angiogenesis. EV-based therapies are particularly appealing due to their lower immunogenicity and ability to exert therapeutic effects without the risks associated with direct stem cell transplantation [5].",
        "In this case report, we present a unique clinical application of allogeneic hUC-MSCs combined with EVs delivered concurrently during a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure. This approach aimed to promote cardiac healing in an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patient who could not be successfully revascularized through conventional PCI. Our findings underscore the substantial regenerative benefits of synergistically combining stem cells and EVs in the treatment of severe myocardial injury.",
        "A 48-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with acute anterior myocardial infarction (MI) at an acute coronary syndrome clinic. His medical history included diabetes mellitus and symptoms consistent with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III HF. Coronary angiography revealed a complete occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the right coronary artery (RCA). Because of the failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the medical team decided to proceed with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).",
        "The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V4), indicating an acute anterior MI. Blood tests indicated elevated levels of troponin I, and indicating damage to the myocardial muscle. A coronary angiography was conducted, which revealed total occlusion of LAD and RCA. Attempts to recanalize the LAD via PCI failed, requiring the use of an alternative treatment approach.",
        "The pre-operative transthoracic echocardiogram (ECHO) revealed a severely reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 31%, which was indication of a severe decrease in the left ventricular systolic function. The end-diastolic volume (EDV) was 126 ml, whereas the end-systolic volume (ESV) was measured as 86 ml. These values indicate inadequate ventricular function. ECHO showed akinesia of the anterior, anteroseptal, and anterolateral walls, as well as hypokinesia of the inferior wall. This reflects the extensive myocardial infarction in the LAD territory (Fig. 1).Fig. 1ECHO examination results before and after following MSC + EV therapy. A Before surgery: Baseline ECHO examination showing impaired left ventricular function with an EF of 31%, EDV of 126 ml, and ESV of 86 ml. These values indicate significant left ventricular dysfunction, with reduced contractility and cardiac output. B Post-op 6 months: Follow-up ECHO at six months post- MSC + EV therapy demonstrates marked improvement in cardiac function, with an EF increased to 43%, EDV to 136 ml, and ESV reduced to 78 ml. The improvement in EF reflects enhanced myocardial contractility, while the reduction in ESV indicates more effective blood ejection during systole. The overall normalization of these parameters suggests a successful therapeutic response, with improved left ventricular performance",

        "The analysis of Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy (MPS) confirmed the presence of extensive perfusion abnormalities in the anterior, anteroseptal, inferoseptal, and inferior areas, which were suggestive of a recent anterior MI and a prior inferior MI. The results were consistent with ECG and ECHO findings. MPS also indicated an EF of 28%, providing further evidence to support the severity of the left ventricular failure shown on the ECHO (Fig. 2). Due to the severity of myocardial injury and the ineffectiveness of PCI in restoring sufficient blood flow, the patient was considered as a suitable candidate for CABG. Simultaneously, it was proposed to deliver hUC-MSCs together with EVs directly into the heart during the surgical operation, aiming to promote cardiac regeneration and improve cardiac function.Fig. 2Changes in myocardial perfusion and cardiac function over time following MSC + EV therapy.

        "hUC-MSC and EV products were acquired from the LivMedCell Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility located in Istanbul, Turkey. The umbilical cord was acquired from a single donor following their informed permission, as authorized by the institutional regulatory board (LivMedCell). The umbilical cord collected after childbirth was sourced from a donor who had completed a full-term pregnancy.",
        "The umbilical cord obtained from a healthy mother with informed consent was cleansed using phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen/Gibco, Paisley, UK). Following vascular excision, the tissue was dissected into explants measuring 5–10 mm3. The tissue explants were placed in culture plates and incubated under culture conditions (5% CO2 and 37 °C) until the cells migrated out from the explants. The cells were harvested once they reached a confluency of 70–80%, and characterization tests of the cells were carried out at passage 3. The final MSC product consisted of 33 × 106 allogeneic hUC-MSCs, with a cell viability of 94%. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the expression of CD73 (99.08%), CD90 (99.3%), and CD105 (92.34%), while negative for HLA-DR (0.08%), CD34 (0.08%), and CD45 (0.08%), consistent with ISCT criteria of MSCs. Quality control assays confirmed sterility and mycoplasma negativity (PCR-based), endotoxin level below 0.25 EU/mL (LAL assay), expressed gene profile consistent with MSC phenotype demonstration, as well as low relative telomerase activity indicating the safety and the non tumorigenicity potential of the product. 33 × 106 allogeneic hUC-MSCs were released from the facility on the operation day. To prepare the EV product, hUC-MSCs were cultured until they reached 90% confluency. The cell media were replaced with serum-free MSC NutriStem® XF Media and incubated in a humidified environment for a minimum of 48 h. After the incubation period, the media containing the cells/cell debris was collected and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min, followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min to pellet the cells and eliminate any remaining debris. Next, centrifugation was carried out at 5000 × g for 20 min to remove nuclei and dead cell debris. Subsequently, the clarified supernatant underwent ultracentrifugation at a force of 100,000 × g for the duration of 70 min in order to enrich the concentration of the EVs. The pellet was reconstituted in 500 µl of DPBS, with a pH of 7.4, and stored at a temperature of −86 °C until it was utilized. EVs were phenotyped with tetraspanin markers (CD81, CD9, and CD63) and analyzed by flow cytometry (CD9 + 82.3%, CD63 + 86.8% and CD81 + 90%). Nanoparticle tracking analyses (NTA) were also conducted on the final EV product, indicating a size distribution that peaked mostly between 30 to 150 nm. For clinical applications, 5 × 109 particles in 500 µl were used.",
        "The patient had a CABG × 4 operation, conducted without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. This approach was chosen to minimize the potential risks associated with bypass, particularly in a patient with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and HF. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was used for hemodynamic support during the procedure. This device permitted adequate coronary perfusion and lowered the need of myocardial oxygen.",
        "Considering the extent of heart muscle necrosis and the poor regenerative capacity of the heart, the surgical team decided to combine a regenerative approach with the CABG technique. We chose to use hUC-MSCs and EVs derived from hUC-MSCs as they are known to enhance heart muscle healing, reduce inflammation, and promote the growth of new blood vessels [4, 5]. During the operation, a total of 33 × 106 allogeneic hUC-MSCs and 5 × 109 particles of hUC-MSC-derived EVs were precisely injected into the myocardium. The injections were strategically targeted at the anterior, inferior, and septal walls, areas most affected by ischemia. The rationale adopting direct intramyocardial injections was driven by the need to deliver the therapeutic agents precisely to the areas of greatest need, maximizing the potential for localized repair and regeneration. The process included meticulous cartography of the myocardium to pinpoint the most optimal locations for injection, circumventing regions of total tissue death and instead concentrating on the transitional areas between ischemia and unaffected tissue. The stem cells were administered in multiple small doses across these areas to achieve a uniform distribution and reduce the likelihood of local tissue disruption. The EVs were co-transplanted with the stem cells to amplify the paracrine signaling effects, given their aptitude to mediate the microenvironment and support the healing. The main objective of this intervention was to stabilize the patient’s cardiac function and initiate a regenerative process aimed at improving ventricular performance progressively. Our approach of combining CABG with regenerative therapy was center on the intent to restore blood flow to ischemic myocardium and to promote the repair and regeneration of damaged myocardial tissue, leading towards improved EF and decreased ventricular volumes.",
        "Following the CABG procedure, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for comprehensive monitoring. The initial post-operative course was uneventful, with stable hemodynamics supported by the IABP. However, on post-operative Day 3, the patient developed sudden ventricular arrhythmia and experienced a cardiac arrest. Prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed, and the patient was successfully stabilized with anti-arrhythmic therapy.",
        "Serial follow-up imaging studies were conducted to monitor graft patency and myocardial recovery. One month after the surgery and cell therapy, MPS and ECHO assessments showed a slight decline in cardiac function. EF decreased from 28 to 24%, EDV increased from 182 to 184 ml, and ESV rose from 132 to 140 ml (Figs. 2B and 4). Despite optimized medical therapy—including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins—early functional response was limited.",
        "At the three-month follow-up, cardiac function began to improve. ECHO showed an EF of 28%, with EDV decreasing to 166 ml and ESV to 119 ml (Figs. 2C and 4). Myocardial perfusion imaging revealed better perfusion in the previously ischemic anterior and septal walls, with visible recovery in wall motion (Fig. 3C). The patient’s functional capacity also improved to NYHA Class II, reflecting reduced symptom burden and improved quality of life.Fig. 3Myocardial perfusion images (stress and rest states) are shown in short-axis (SA), vertical long-axis (VLA), and horizontal long-axis (HLA) views at four different time points: A Initial Evaluation (Pre-op 1 month): Baseline perfusion imaging reveals multiple areas of reduced perfusion, particularly during stress testing. These darkened regions represent significant perfusion defects, indicating compromised blood flow and ischemia. B Post-op 1 month: There is minimal improvement in myocardial perfusion during both stress and rest states. Perfusion defects remain evident, with persistent areas of ischemia. C Post-op 3 months: Significant improvement in perfusion is observed. There is a marked reduction in perfusion defects, with more consistent blood flow during both stress and rest conditions. D Post-op 6 months: The final follow-up demonstrates sustained and substantial improvement in myocardial perfusion.

        "At six months post-operation, repeat coronary angiography was performed due to the recurrence of exertional dyspnea. The imaging revealed that the bypass graft to LAD artery was occluded. Remarkably, despite the failed graft, ECHO demonstrated further improvement in cardiac function, with EF reaching 43%, EDV 136 ml, and ESV 78 ml (Figs. 1B, 2D, and 4). These results suggest a sustained regenerative response beyond the mechanical revascularization alone, likely attributed to the biologic effects of the combined stem cell and EV therapy. A concise timeline of the clinical course is provided below:Day 0: Off-pump CABG performed with direct intramyocardial injection of 33 × 10⁶ hUC-MSCs and 5 × 10⁹ EVs.Day 3: Ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrest; resuscitated and stabilized.1 Month Post-op: EF dropped to 24%, with slight increases in EDV and ESV.3 Months Post-op: EF improved to 28%, perfusion and wall motion began to recover.6 Months Post-op: EF reached 43% (ECHO) and 35% (MPS), with improved myocardial function despite LAD graft occlusion.Fig. 4Changes in cardiac parameters over time following MSC + EV therapy. This graph illustrates the temporal changes in key cardiac parameters, including EF, EDV, and ESV, in a patient undergoing MSC + EV therapy. The time of cell therapy administration is marked by a vertical dashed line on the graph. Ejection Fraction (EF %): The EF showed a delayed but steady improvement over time, starting at 28% during the initial evaluation (pre-op 1 month). There was a slight decrease to 24% at 1 month post-op, followed by an increase to 28% at 3 months post-op, and further improvement to 35% at 6 months post-op, indicating a gradual enhancement in myocardial contractility. End-Diastolic Volume (EDV, ml): The EDV showed a progressive decrease from 182 ml at the initial evaluation to 122 ml at 6 months post-op. This reduction in EDV suggests improved cardiac efficiency and a normalization of ventricular size over time. End-Systolic Volume (ESV, ml): Similarly, the ESV decreased from 132 ml pre-op to 80 ml at 6 months post-op, indicating more effective ejection of blood with each heartbeat as the therapy took effect. These trends collectively demonstrate the positive impact of MSC therapy on cardiac function, with gradual improvements in both the structural and functional parameters of the heart over time",

        "Especially in patients with failed revascularization or high-risk surgical profiles, this case underscores the potential value of combining MSC and EV therapy as a meaningful adjunct to conventional cardiac surgery. Despite early postoperative deterioration and eventual graft occlusion, the sustained improvement in cardiac function suggests that intramyocardial delivery of regenerative agents may activate intrinsic repair mechanisms that persist independently of graft patency. These findings support the integration of biologic therapies into standard surgical protocols and highlight the need for further research to establish safety, efficacy, and optimal delivery strategies in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.",
        "The results of this case report align with previous preclinical findings regarding the therapeutic potential of EVs and MSCs in myocardial regeneration. Animal studies have demonstrated that EVs stimulate healing in infarcted myocardium [6], prevent HF progression [7], and mediate these effects primarily through paracrine signaling mechanisms. The intramyocardial injection of EVs and MSCs during the bypass surgery in this case aimed to enhance direct repair of ischemic regions. ECHO and MPS evaluations during our regular follow-ups demonstrated a significant increase in EF and improved wall motion in the anterior wall, even after the occlusion of the bypass graft (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4). Typically, permanently akinetic regions would be expected post-infarction, highlighting the potential regenerative impact of the therapy.",
        "Following MI, several cytokines and growth factors initiate inflammatory mechanisms to promote tissue regeneration. Several studies indicate that acute cardiac damage triggers the activation and replenishment of both cardiac progenitor cells and the reprogramming of non-cardiac progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the site of injury [8–10]. However, clinical research has shown that bone marrow- or blood-derived stem cells do not significantly regenerate cardiac tissue. Instead, MSC-derived EVs are recognized as the primary mediators of cardiac repair [11]. EVs facilitate healing via miRNA transfer, promoting anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic responses [7, 12–14]. Importantly, EVs produced by different stem cell types carry distinct miRNA profiles, influencing their regenerative effects [15–18]. Hence, EVs produced from distinct stem cells are not identical, since each EV carries the specific miRNA profile of its parent stem cell phenotype.",
        "In our case, we derived EVs from allogenic hUC-MSCs. Preclinical studies suggest that hUC-MSC derived EVs are a safe and effective cell-free strategy to promote angiogenesis [19, 20]. Compared to autologous stem cells, hUC-MSCs offer advantages such as superior immunomodulation, ease of extraction, and faster proliferation [20, 21]. Furthermore, MSC-derived EVs have been shown to improve cardiac stem cell survival and function [21]. Although no adverse effects were observed in this case, we acknowledge reports of rare complications such as pulmonary embolism following high-dose EV administration [22].",
        "In our approach, EVs and MSCs were injected directly into the border zone between infarcted and viable myocardium [18, 23], an area known to exhibit ischemia without necrosis. The timing and method of delivery were chosen based on evidence that direct intramyocardial injection during surgery provides superior tissue targeting and regenerative stimulus [24, 25].",
        "In patients undergoing CABG, improvements in EF are typically modest. Depending on baseline function and viability studies [26–28] indicate increases ranging from ~ 3% to 10%. Soetisna et al. observed an average EF improvement of + 2.91% [26]; Koene et al. reported an increase from 36 to 41% [27]; Ponuru et al. highlighted an improvement from 29.5% to 39.9% [28]. Although no causal conclusion can be made in a single-patient example, our patient's EF increased from 25 to 45%, suggesting a possibly enhanced regeneration impact beyond typical CABG recovery. Therapeutic use of MSCs and MSC-derived EVs in cardiovascular disorders has been investigated extensively [29, 30]. MSCs contribute to myocardial recovery primarily through paracrine mechanisms, including modulation of inflammation, promotion of angiogenesis, and attenuation of fibrosis [30]. EVs produced from MSCs have shown promise in improving heart function, lowering infarct size, and protecting against ischemia–reperfusion damage [31]. Although most past research has focused on systemic or intracoronary administration after infarction, integration of regenerative treatments during cardiac operations is attracting increasing attention. Our case enhances the growing corpus of data. In our case, MSC and EV application to the border zone of the infarcted area was performed during bypass revascularization. After a short period of time, the patient experienced occlusion of the bypass graft in the LAD territory. Despite failed revascularization during subsequent PCI attempts, the healing process continued, suggesting that EV-mediated effects may have supported tissue repair even under hypoxic conditions [32, 33].",
        "Limitations: This report represents a single-patient observation, limiting generalizability. No control group or comparator was available. Mechanistic assessments, including direct markers of angiogenesis, fibrosis, or inflammation (e.g., VEGF-A, hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF-α), were not performed. While clinical follow-up showed no adverse effects, the absence of systemic biomarker monitoring is acknowledged. Future studies involving larger cohorts, molecular analyses, and prolonged follow-up are required to validate and expand these findings.",
        "The field of cell therapy and research on EVs in cardiovascular medicine is fast expanding; however, many questions are still left unaddressed. The ultimate objective is to optimize methods for isolation of EVs and for targeted delivery to the heart. This will allow for safe therapeutic use for cardiovascular disease. EV-based cell-free therapy represents a promising adjunct to revascularization strategies in treating acute and subacute MI. Such an approach could potentially prevent the progression to HF or improve myocardial healing with or without revascularization. Not all MI patients are suitable candidates for revascularization, and even revascularization success, ischemia–reperfusion injury can compromise cardiac recovery.",
        "Preclinical studies have shown that EVs provide protective effects in conditions involving ischemia–reperfusion injury. In the present case report, we observed remarkable improvements in cardiac function following the administration of EVs and MSCs during a CABG procedure. ECHO and MPS were used to monitor these improvements in myocardial wall motion. Future clinical studies could benefit from incorporating advanced imaging techniques such as cardiac MRI or PET scanning. These modalities offer comprehensive insights into myocardial viability and stages of healing, potentially offering a more comprehensive assessment than ECHO and MPS alone.",
        "In recent years, studies have increasingly focused on the potential of EV-based therapies in cardiovascular diseases, shifting the focus from traditional cell therapy to cell-free approaches. While the benefits of EV therapy are promising, significant challenges and limitations, such as scalability and delivery methods, require attention. More clinical studies are required in order to better comprehend and exploit the therapeutic feasibility of EVs for heart diseases. In conclusion, while our case underscores the potential benefits of combining stem cells and EVs in treating myocardial infarction, continuous research and clinical trials are crucial to fully understand their therapeutic impact and enhance their clinical application.",

    "title": "Natural product library screening identifies Darutigenol for the treatment of myocardial infarction and ischemia/reperfusion injury. due to the inability of regeneration of adult cardiomyocytes (CMs). Natural products from medical herbs are an important source of innovative drugs for many diseases including cardiovascular diseases. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we set out to screen novel small-molecule therapies from natural products to protect heart against ischemic injury. METHODS: High-throughput screening was performed using a natural product library to identify the potential small molecules which can promote survival of CMs under ischemic and ischemic/reperfusion conditions. In addition, myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) mice models were used to evaluate the in vivo effects of the screened candidate. We also applied various analysis including cell viability, qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescent staining, echocardiography, Masson's staining, TTC staining, and network pharmacology. RESULTS: High-throughput screening showed that the small molecule compound Darutigenol (Dar), derived from the Chinese traditional herb Herba Siegesbeckiae, could significantly promote CM survival and proliferation under ischemic conditions. Moreover, I/R-induced CM apoptosis and ROS generation could be significantly reduced by Dar treatment. In addition, in vivo administration of Dar was able to attenuate MI- and I/R-induced cardiac injury in adult mice by decreasing fibrosis and apoptosis, thereby improving cardiac function. Network pharmacology analysis and molecule docking assay showed that Dar has the highest binding affinity with AKT1 protein. Western blotting assay further revealed that AKT1 activation was significantly enhanced by Dar administration in the infarcted hearts. CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed that the small molecule compound Dar, screened from the natural product library in this study, is capable of protecting heart against MI and I/R injury by activating AKT1 pathway. These findings enrich the natural product candidates for cardiovascular disease treatment and provide new insights into potential therapeutic agents for MI and I/R injury. Zhongshan, 528437, China.

      "title": "Natural product library screening identifies Darutigenol for the treatment of myocardial infarction and ischemia/reperfusion injury",
      "abstract": "Introduction Ischemic heart diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide due to the inability of regeneration of adult cardiomyocytes (CMs). Natural products from medical herbs are an important source of innovative drugs for many diseases including cardiovascular diseases. Objectives In this study, we set out to screen novel small-molecule therapies from natural products to protect heart against ischemic injury. Methods High-throughput screening was performed using a natural product library to identify the potential small molecules which can promote survival of CMs under ischemic and ischemic/reperfusion conditions. In addition, myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) mice models were used to evaluate the in vivo effects of the screened candidate. We also applied various analysis including cell viability, qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescent staining, echocardiography, Masson’s staining, TTC staining, and network pharmacology. Results High-throughput screening showed that the small molecule compound Darutigenol (Dar), derived from the Chinese traditional herb Herba Siegesbeckiae , could significantly promote CM survival and proliferation under ischemic conditions. Moreover, I/R-induced CM apoptosis and ROS generation could be significantly reduced by Dar treatment. In addition, in vivo administration of Dar was able to attenuate MI- and I/R-induced cardiac injury in adult mice by decreasing fibrosis and apoptosis, thereby improving cardiac function. Network pharmacology analysis and molecule docking assay showed that Dar has the highest binding affinity with AKT1 protein. Western blotting assay further revealed that AKT1 activation was significantly enhanced by Dar administration in the infarcted hearts. Conclusions Our data revealed that the small molecule compound Dar, screened from the natural product library in this study, is capable of protecting heart against MI and I/R injury by activating AKT1 pathway. These findings enrich the natural product candidates for cardiovascular disease treatment and provide new insights into potential therapeutic agents for MI and I/R injury.",

        "Ischemic cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, produces tremendous health and economic problems around the world [1]. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) caused by coronary occlusion is the largest contributor to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Due to mammalian cardiomyocytes possessing very limited self-renewal ability after birth, injured heart after MI unable to replenish cardiomyocytes (CMs) to repair itself [2, 3]. The infarcted area will be replaced with nonfunctional collagen and fibrotic scar. Timely resupply of coronary perfusion using the therapeutic methods such as thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention is vital to reduce cardiomyocytes death [4]. However, during the course of restoration of blood flow into the ischemia heart, it also induces immense CMs injury termed as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury [5]. Therefore, investigating management options to induce resident CM division and proliferation as well as fibrosis resolution is a promising strategy for heart repair. As small molecule drugs have plenty of advantages, including reduced cost and immune response, and easily to find pharmacologic target for drugs. Based on natural compound library screening, the molecules bufalin and lycorine have been identified as drug candidates for therapeutic applications in cardiac fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction [6]. In a latest study, artesunate was identified as an efficient agent for cardiac fibrosis treatment from a library of ∼5,000 compounds using a high-throughput screening [7]. These previous reports suggest that the natural small molecule compounds may be a promising resource to identify therapeutic agents for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.",
        "In this study, we performed a high-throughput screening using a natural product library of 1,271 compounds, and found that the small molecule compound Darutigenol could efficiently protect CMs in the in vitro and in vivo models of MI and I/R injury. Darutigenol (Dar) is a natural product derived from the aerial parts of the traditional Chinese herb Herba Sigesbeckia (HS). HS belongs to the family of Asteraceae that is widely distributed in many countries in Asia. Many traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions containing HS have been used to treat diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, snakebites and malaria [8, 9]. Researchers have demonstrated that the extracts of HS possess the efficacy to mitigate inflammatory and algetic response [10], to attenuate cartilage degradation and bone erosion in mouse rheumatoid arthritis model [11], to suppress tumor cells growth in vitro [12], to alleviate cardiac I/R injury in rats [13]. However, as a main ingredient of HS, the potential roles of Dar in cardiac MI and I/R injury remain largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that Dar administration can promote survival of CMs under MI and I/R conditions through the activation of AKT1 pathway, thereby attenuating myocardial MI and I/R injury.",
        "Briefly, HL-1 cells (a mouse cardiac muscle cell line) were cultivated in 96-well plates at a density of 2,000 cells per well in a high-glucose DMEM medium containing 0.2% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. 24 h after seeding, the cells within the in positive control group were cultured with 10% FBS, while the drug treatment and negative control groups were respectively subjected to a library of 1,271 natural products (Selleck, L1400) at a final concentration of 10 μM and vehicle at the same concentration, respectively. Cells were then treated for 48 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator and subsequently incubated with 10 μL CCK-8 solution (Beyotime, C0039) for another 1 h before being loaded onto the micro plate reader (Biotec) to detect cell viability. The “proliferation index” was determined by the following equation: proliferation index = OD450nm in drug treatment group/OD450nm in negative group.",
        "Neonatal and adult C57BL/6 J mice (male, 8–10 weeks) were purchased from Guangdong Zhiyuan Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd (Guangzhou, China). Mice were feed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) laboratory animal facility of Jinan University (Guangzhou, China). The animal experiments described in this study were conducted according to the Guidelines on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals for biomedical research, as published by the National Institutes of Health (No.85-23, revised 1996). All animal protocols and procedures were approved by the Laboratory Animal Committee of Jinan University (IACUC-20210607-06).",
        "The hearts of P3 mice were collected and washed two times with PBS (Servicebio, G0002) to remove the remaining blood. Then, the hearts were cut into small chunks of ~ 1 mm3 and transferred to a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing 10 mL of digestive buffer I (0.0125% trypsin–EDTA; Gibco, 25200056 and 10.11 mg/mL BDM; Sigma, B0753). The tube was then subjected to constant stirring at 4 °C for a duration of 12 h. Subsequently, the supernatant was discarded and 10 mL of digestive buffer II containing collagenase II (1.5 mg/mL; Gibco, 17101015) and BDM (2 mg/mL) was added. The mixture was stirred continuously in a 37 °C water bath for 15 min and slowly blown 10 times with a pipette. After digestion, cells were collected by filtration through a 70 μm cell strainer. The filtrate was centrifuged at 660 rpm for 5 min, after which the cell precipitate was resuspended in 5 mL of high-glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin and then seeded onto 6-cm cell dishes for 2 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Suspended cardiomyocytes were then collected and seeded onto cell culture plates pre-treated with Lamin (14.3 μg/mL; Gibco, 354232). After 24–48 h, isolated cardiomyocytes were used to corresponding experiments [14].",
        "To assess the effect of candidate molecules on CM proliferation, the cell proliferative phase marker Ki67, and phosphorylated histone H3 (pH3) were utilized. For Ki67 and pH3 staining, CMs were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Servicebio, G1101) for one hour after stimulation with candidate agents for two days. Primal antibodies of Ki67 (Servicebio, GB111499, 1:500) and pH3 (CST, 9701S, 1:300) were then co-incubated with cTnT antibody (Proteintech, 15513-1-AP, 1:300) to the CMs, respectively, following blocking with 5% BSA for one hour at room temperature. Next, CMs were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with nucleic dye DAPI (Beyotime, C1006) for 15 min. Finally, the CMs were incubated with CoraLite488-conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Proteintech, SA00013-1, 1:300) and Cy3-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (Proteintech, SA00009-2, 1:300) for one hour at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS. For each sample, at least 10 images were captured at random. More than 2,000 CMs were counted per sample.",
        "MI injury in adult C57BL/6 J mice (8–10 weeks) was induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) as previously described [15]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 250 μL of pentobarbital sodium (70 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldridge, P3761). The hairs on the throat and chest of mice were removed and sterilized with 75% ethanol and povidone iodine solution. After connecting the mice's trachea to the ventilator, the chests of the mice were opened between the third and fourth ribs on the left side of the mice to expose the heart. Using an 8–0 silk suture to permanent ligation of the LAD to induce MI, the cavity in the chest and throat were sutured with a 6–0 silk suture. For sham operated mice, all the steps are the same as above, except that the LAD is not ligated.",
        "I/R injury in adult mice was established by short-term ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) as previously described [16]. Operations like anesthesia, endotracheal Intubation, and thoracotomy were the same as those described in the MI model above. However, in the step of ligation LAD, a 2–3 mm long piece of PE-10 tubing needed to be placed over the LAD. The tubing and LAD were then ligated using a 7–0 silk suture, inducing myocardial ischemia. Following a 45-min period, the tubing over the LAD was then removed in order to re-perfuse the blood to the heart. In the sham-operated mice, all the aforementioned steps were replicated, with the exception of LAD ligation. Finally, the cavity in the chest and throat were sutured with a 6–0 silk suture.",
        "The cardiac function of the mice was measured using echocardiography (VINNO 6 LAB, China) at specific time points following the induction of MI. Left ventricle systolic function, including left ventricle ejection fraction (EF, %) and fractional shortening (FS, %), was determined by measuring M-mode echocardiography from the short axis of the left ventricle at the papillary muscle level.",
        "Mice hearts were embedded in paraffin and cut in 5 μm-thick sections, and stained with Masson's Trichrome staining Kit (Solarbio, G1340) in accordance with manufacturers'manuals. Heart sections were scan using digital microscope (Motic Easyscan 6, China). The normal areas of the heart are stained red by Ponceau-Acid Fuchsin solution, while areas that are infarcted are stained blue by Aniline Blue solution. The infarcted area of cardiac sections was measured by ImageJ software.",
        "Paraffin-embedded heart sections were stained with WGA solution (WGA, 5 μg/mL, Thermo Fisher, W11261) in darkness for 15 min at room temperature. After washed three times by PBS, the sections were photographed by confocal microscopy (Olympus FV3000, Japan). To measure the cross-section area of CMs, more than 10 fields and 200 cells were analyzed for each heart section using ImageJ software.",
        "Total RNA was extracted from mice hearts using RNA isolater Total RNA Extraction Reagent (Vazyme, R401-01). 1 μg total RNA was reverse transcription to cDNA using HiScript II Q Select RT SuperMix (Vazyme, R233-01). The qPCR was performed using ChamQ Blue Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Q312-02) on the MiniOpticon qPCR System (Bio-Rad, USA).

Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g and supernatants were collected as whole cell extracts. Protein concentration was quantified using a BCA protein quantification test kit (Servicebio, G2026). 50 μg total protein per sample was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies. Primal antibodies used in this study are following: anti-Bax (CST, 14796, 1:1000), anti-Bcl2 (Huabio, ET1702-53, 1:1000), anti-GAPDH (Proteintech, 60004-1-Ig, 1:10000). Secondary antibodies used are following: goat-anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (CST, #7076, 1:5000) and goat-anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (CST, #7074, 1:5000). Signals were detected with the ChemiDoc XRS chemiluminescent gel imaging system (Analytik Jena). The relative expression levels of the target protein were analyzed using ImageJ software.",
        "The hearts of mice were harvested and washed twice in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) after 24 h of cardiac I/R injury. The hearts were then flash frozen at −80 ℃ for 10 min. After this, the hearts were sliced into 1 mm-thick sections and stained with 1% 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution (Servicebio, G1017) in the dark for 15 min at 37 ℃. The area at the ischemic zone displayed a white color due to the absence of dehydrogenase enzymes, while the healthy area presented a red color. The heart sections were photographed by digital camera (Canon, Japan). The infarcted area of the heart sections was then measured using ImageJ software.",

        "The molecular structure of the natural product Darutigenol (Dar) was obtained from the PubChem database. The SwissTargetPrediction and PharmMapper databases were utilized to predict the potential target of Dar. The ischemic heart disease-related targets were obtained from five databases, including DisGeNET, Genecards, TTD, and CTD. The predicted Dar targets were then overlapped with the ischemic heart disease-related targets to obtain the intersection targets by the Venny map. The intersection targets were subsequently imported into the String database to construct the network of drug-target-disease. The key targets of Dar were then screened by topology analysis in Cytoscape software [17]. The David database was used to analyze the function of the molecule and the signaling pathway involved. Furthermore, the AutoDock Vina software was used to predict the binding affinity between Dar and its targets. The docking results were visualized by PyMOL software [18].",
        "The statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism 8 Software.

Comparisons between two groups were analyzed using unpaired and 2-tailed Student's t-test. All data are presented as the mean ± SEM. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",
        "To screen the potential natural products protecting cardiomyocytes against ischemic injury, a natural monomer product library was used to treat HL-1 cells (a mouse cardiac muscle cell line) under ischemic conditions (0.2% FBS). Firstly, we performed a high-throughput screening based on cell counting assay to identify compounds that promote HL-1 cells survival under ischemic conditions (0.2% FBS). The 10% FBS was used as a positive control (PC). The first round of screening showed that 73 out of 1,271 compounds led to an at least 1.3-fold increase in cell viability under ischemic conditions compared with vehicle group (Fig. 1A, B). Next, a second round of screening was performed to evaluate whether these 73 candidate molecules could improve the proliferation of primary cardiomyocytes (CMs) isolated from neonatal mouse under the ischemic conditions. Among these 73 potential candidates, Ki67 staining revealed that only one molecule named Darutigenol (Dar), an extract of the Chinese traditional herb Herba Siegesbeckiae, significantly increased CMs proliferation by 2-folds at a concentration of 10 μM when compared with the vehicle group (Fig. 1C–F). To prove complete cardiomyocyte proliferation, the late cell cycle marker phospho-Histone H3 (pH3) was further used in this study. Our data showed that ischemia treatment greatly decreased the percentage of pH3+ CMs compared with positive control group. However, Dar treatment significantly increased the percentage of pH3+ CMs under ischemic conditions (Figure G and H). These findings suggest that Dar treatment really promotes the proliferation of cardiomyocytes under ischemic conditions. To evaluate the potential cytotoxicity of Dar, primary CMs were treated with different concentrations of Dar, ranging from 0.5 to 160 μM. The result showed that Dar had no apparent cytotoxicity to primary CMs even at a dose of 80 Μm (Fig. 1I). Collectively, these data indicate that Dar treatment could significantly protect primary CMs from ischemic injury in vitro.Fig. 1Dar screening for CM survival under ischemic conditions.

        "To further determine whether Dar treatment protects CMs from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in vitro, primary CMs isolated from neonatal mice at p1 were subjected to hypoxia/re-oxygenation (H/R) injury, an ideal in vitro model of myocardium I/R injury. We found that the cell viability of CMs was greatly reduced by I/R, whereas Dar treatment significantly elevated the cell viability of CMs under the condition of I/R (Fig. 2A, B), indicating the protective effects of Dar treatment on cardiomyocytes upon I/R injury. DCFH-DA staining showed that intracellular ROS generation in primary CMs was greatly induced by I/R. However, the increased ROS generation could be significantly reduced by Dar treatment (Fig. 2C, D), implying the antioxidant function of Dar in CMs upon I/R injury. In consistent with this observation, TUNEL staining revealed the anti-apoptotic function of Dar in primary CMs under I/R conditions, as demonstrated by the decreased percentage of TUNEL+ CMs in Dar-treated group compared with vehicle-treated group (Fig. 2E, F). In line with TUNEL staining, I/R injury remarkably increased LDH release in primary CMs, whereas the I/R-induced LDH release was significantly blocked by Dar treatment (Fig. 1G). These findings suggest that Dar protects primary CMs from I/R injury by reducing ROS generation, cellular apoptosis, and LDH release.Fig. 2Dar protects primary CMs from I/R injury in vitro.

        "To explore whether Dar treatment improves cardiac dysfunction induced by myocardial ischemia injury, adult male mice were subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) injury, followed by intraperitoneally injection of Dar (10 mg/kg) for five times within 10 days (Fig. 3A). The sham and control groups were administered the same volume of vehicle (Fig. 3A). Survival analysis indicated that there were no significant differences between the sham, control, and Dar-treated groups within 30 days post-MI (dpM) (Fig. 3B). To determine whether Dar treatment influences cardiac function, the echocardiographic analysis was performed from 0 to 28 dpM. Our data showed that cardiac function was improved in Dar-treated mice compared with control group from 7 to 28 dpM, as demonstrated by the increased levels of ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) (Fig. 3C–E). Consistently, Masson’s staining revealed that Dar treatment significantly reduced the scar size at 28 dpM compared with control group (Fig. 3F, G), implying a reduced fibrosis in Dar-treated hearts. In agreement with this result, MI injury remarkably increased the expression of fibrotic markers including α-SMA and Col-3 compared with sham group, whereas Dar treatment significantly suppressed the expression of α-SMA and Col-3 compared with control group (Fig. 3H, I). Histological analysis showed that the increased heart weight to body weight ratio (HW/BW) in control group was significantly reduced by Dar treatment (Fig. 3J).Fig. 3Dar improves cardiac dysfunction induced by myocardial infarction (MI).

        "To further determine whether Dar facilitates heart repair after MI by inducing the proliferation of CMs, we performed Ki67 staining and found that there were no significant differences in Ki67+ CMs between control and Dar-treated groups (Fig. 4A, B). The WGA staining revealed that MI injury greatly increased CM size compared with sham group, whereas Dar administration has no significant impacts on the increased CM size induced by MI injury (Fig. 4C, D). Subsequently, we evaluated the effect of Dar on CMs apoptosis in the context of MI. As evidenced by a western blot assay, Bax/Bcl2 ratio in hearts was greatly increased by MI injury, which was further significantly suppressed by Dar administration (Fig. 4E, F), exhibiting an anti-apoptotic effect of Dar against MI injury. Taken together, these data suggest that Dar treatment might attenuate MI injury by decreasing cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis.Fig. 4Effects of Dar treatment on CM proliferation, hypertrophy, and apoptosis in the infarcted hearts.

        "To investigate whether Dar administration protects against I/R injury, adult male mice were intraperitoneally injected with Dar (10 mg/kg) every three days for one week prior to I/R injury, followed by ischemia induction for 45 min and reperfusion for 24 h (Fig. 5A). The echocardiography results revealed a notable decline in cardiac function in the control mice compared with the sham group following I/R injury, while Dar pretreatment effectively ameliorated the cardiac function in the hearts upon I/R injury (Fig. 5B–D). In parallel with the enhanced cardiac function, mice subjected to Dar pretreatment had smaller infarct sizes than that in control mice, as shown by TTC staining (Fig. 5E, F). The HW/BW ratio was increased by I/R injury, whereas Dar administration had no significant impacts on the HW/BW ratio in the mice upon I/R injury (Fig. 5G). H&E staining revealed that I/R caused significant cardiac damage, characterized by extensive disruption of myocardial fibers, while the myocardial injury was markedly reduced by the Dar pretreatment (Fig. 5H). Taken together, these data imply that Dar pretreatment might protect the heart from I/R injury.Fig. 5Dar mitigates I/R-induced cardiac injury in mice.

        "To explore the underlying mechanism and targets of Dar in IHD, network pharmacology was utilized in this study. Initially, 390 putative targets of Dar were obtained using the Pharmmapper and SwissTarget databases based on the structure of Dar. Next, 1,071 IHD-related disease targets from four databases including DisGeNET, GeneCards, TTD, and CTD were identified. By overlapping these putative targets of Dar with IHD-related disease targets, 123 intersection targets of Dar against IHD were acquired (Fig. 6A). Then, these intersection targets for Dar treatment of IHD were imported into the String database to construct the PPI protein interaction network (Fig. 6B). Based on the value of degree, betweenness, and closeness, the top 26 key targets including MMP9, AKT1, ALB, CASP3, and HSP90AA1 were selected (Fig. 6C).Fig. 6Network pharmacology for predicting the potential targets of Dar against ischemic heart disease.

        "In order to elucidate the potential functions of these core targets, gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis were performed via using the David database. According to the GO enrichment analysis, apoptosis regulation, response to ROS, and other biological processes were significant enriched among the top 20 terms (Fig. 6D). The KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that these core targets of Dar were related to several signaling pathways includingPI3K-AKT pathway (Fig. 6E). To further insight into the binding ability of the predicted key targets to Dar, the binding affinity between Dar and the top 10 targets displayed in Fig. 6C was analyzed using the Autodock Vina software respectively. The docking result showed that the binding affinity of Dar to AKT1 protein was −9.1 kcal/mol, which was significantly lower than that of the other targets (Fig. 7A). The docked pose of Dar to AKT1 protein showed that Dar could form a hydrogen bond with the Val-270 and Asn54 on AKT1, as well as a van der Waals interaction with Gln-79, Trp-80, Ile84, Leu-210, Leu-264, and Trp-272 (Fig. 7B, C). These results suggest that Dar may form a strong interaction with AKT1 protein, thereby regulating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway to protect myocardium from ischemic injury.Fig. 7Validation of the target of Dar via molecule docking and western blotting assay.

        "To determine the effect of Dar on PI3K-AKT axis, which is important for cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart repair [19, 20], the protein levels of phosphorylated AKT1 (p-AKT1) and total AKT1 in the heart were evaluated using a western blot assay. Our results showed that MI and I/R injury significantly increased the expression levels of p-AKT1 and AKT1 proteins compared with sham group, although the p-AKT1/AKT1 ratio was only modestly upregulated. However, Dar administration further increased the p-AKT1/AKT1 ratio in the hearts upon MI injury (Fig. 7D–K). Taken together, these findings suggest that Dar administration might protect adult mice against MI and I/R injury by promoting the phosphorylation and activation of AKT1 pathway (Fig. 8).Fig. 8A model of Dar protects heart against cardiac injury. High-throughput screening using CMs identified a small molecule compound named Darutigenol (Dar), which can promote CM survival under ischemic conditions in vitro.

        "In the present study, we screened a small molecule darutigenol (Dar) from a natural products library, and provided in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrating the protective function of Dar against myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We found that Dar treatment can protect primary CMs against ischemic and I/R injury in vitro, by promoting CM proliferation and suppressing CM apoptosis and ROS generation. Moreover, the in vivo protective function of Dar against myocardial infarction (MI) and I/R injury was further evidenced in adult mouse models. Mechanistically, Dar treatment might promote survival of CMs under MI and I/R conditions through the activation of AKT1 pathway, thereby attenuating myocardial ischemic and I/R injury. Our findings suggest that the small molecule Dar is beneficial for myocardial ischemic and I/R injury and provide a new insight into potential therapeutic agents for ischemic heart disease.",
        "In the clinical management of ischemic heart disease, pharmacological treatments have the advantages of lower cost, convenient and controllable administration and interventions [21]. Clinically, anticoagulant and platelet-aggregating drugs, such as aspirin and statins, are frequently employed. Similarly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, which relax blood vessels, lower blood pressure and regulate myocardial oxygen consumption, are commonly used to prevent and relieve myocardial ischemia [22]. Nevertheless, the aforementioned agents are unable to repair the damaged CMs during the period of ischemia, and strategies for treating ischemic myocardium remain a significant challenge. In recent years, researchers have continued to identify the significant roles of small molecules in the treatment of heart disease. These compounds facilitate the repair of cardiac injury by promoting the proliferation of CMs and by reducing inflammatory responses and fibrosis, which in turn enhance heart repair [23–28]. Nevertheless, the process of drug discovery is lengthy and costly, with a relatively low conversion rate from animal to human clinical trials, at less than 8% [29]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover new agents for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.",
        "Many previous studies have suggested that enhancing the capacity of CM proliferation is an effective strategy to promote regeneration and repair of the injured heart [30–33]. In this study, a drug screening assay based on the proliferation of CMs identified a natural monomer product Darutigenol (Dar), which could significantly promote neonatal CM proliferation in vitro. Dar is natural monomer product from the herb Herba Sigesbeckia (HS). HS is recorded in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, snake venom and malaria. However, little is known about its efficacy in heart repair. The results of our animal experiments demonstrated that Dar could alleviate MI-induced cardiac injury in adult mice by mitigating the development of fibrosis and apoptosis, thereby decreasing the infarcted area and improving cardiac function. However, the administration of Dar failed to promote the proliferation of CMs in the infarcted area in the adult mice, as evidenced by the Ki67 labelling assay. Unlike neonatal CMs, adult CMs belong to terminally differentiated cells which lose the self-renew ability [30, 34]. Promoting the proliferation of adult CMs remains a significant challenge that requires urgent attention. Although Dar was unable to promote adult CM proliferation, our data suggest that Dar administration can enhance heart repair, at least in part, through suppressing fibrosis and apoptosis.",
        "In this study, a network pharmacology study revealed that the predicted targets of Dar against ischemic heart disease were significantly enriched in apoptosis regulation and response to ROS. Apoptosis has been identified as a key factor leading to the deterioration of CMs. The inhibition of CM apoptosis has thus emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating heart injury [35, 36]. Furthermore, a KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of apoptosis and proliferation related pathways, including the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and the FoxO signaling pathway. Importantly, Dar and AKT1 protein were shown to have the strongest binding capacity in a molecular docking assay. The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway has been identified as a critical regulator of many biological processes such as survival, proliferation, and apoptosis [37, 38]. Accumulated evidence has demonstrated its involvement in the pathogenesis of various diseases including MI [39]. In response to external or internal stimulations, PI3K kinase converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Subsequent to this, PIP3 binds to the N-terminal Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the AKT protein, resulting in AKT translocating from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane and exposing two amino sites of Ser473 and Thr308. Thereafter, 3-phosphatidylinositol-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDKI) and 3-phosphatidylinositol-dependent protein kinase 2 (PDK2) phosphorylate the above two sites of AKT, thereby leading to the activation of the AKT signaling pathway [40–43]. AKT1, as a core molecule of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, has been implicated in ischemic heart disease (IHD) in many previous studies. Previous research has shown that activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway can attenuate ischemic cardiac insult by inhibiting oxidative stress [44, 45], reducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis [46], suppressing the inflammatory response [45, 47], regulating autophagy [48], and promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation [49]. Consistent with the cardioprotective effect of AKT, the result of our Western blot assay showed that Dar administration after MI and I/R insult significantly increased the expression levels of p-AKT1/AKT1 in the heart of adult mice, suggesting that Dar may activate the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway to promote cardiac repair. In line with our results, the important role of AKT1 in tissues repairs has been reported in previous studies. It has been reported that treatment with AKT1 significantly increased wound closure of heart valve interstitial cells (VICs), while AKT1 inhibition reduced wound of VICs compared with nontreated cells [50]. Moreover, AKT1 activation is required for muscle differentiation [51]. In addition, AKT1 activation facilitates cardiac repair in adult mice by activating EGR1 pathway [52]. These previous studies supported, at least in part, our data showing that AKT1 might be the target of Dar in protecting CMs in hearts upon MI and I/R injury.",
        "Recent studies have identified several natural small molecules and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas with cardioprotective effects. For example, Ginsenoside Rh1 active SIRT3 to suppress oxidative stress and mitochondria damage to protect against myocardial ischemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction [53]. Ginsenoside Rb2 inhibits p300-mediated SF3A2 acetylation for promoting Fscn1 expression to protect cardiomyocytes from ischemic/reperfusion injury [54]. Bufalin and lycorine alleviate Ang II-induced cardiac remodeling by inhibiting myocardial fibrosis. Kaempferol alleviates myocardial ischemia injury by reducing oxidative stress via the HDAC3-mediated Nrf2 signaling pathway [55]. Yiqi Huoxue (YQHX) prescription attenuates oxidative stress by improving the structure and function of mitochondria to mitigate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury [17]. Xinmai’an tablets deduce mitochondrial oxidative stress damage by activating the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway to alleviate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury [56]. Mechanistically, reducing the level of oxidative stress and apoptosis after myocardial ischemic injury is an effective strategy to promote myocardial protection against myocardial injury. Our results also demonstrated that Dar mitigates ischemic cardiac injury by reducing the level of ROS and apoptosis, although its molecular mechanisms are different from the above-mentioned drugs. Moreover, the natural product Dar possesses the advantages of low toxicity and ease of access, rendering it a promising candidate for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.",
        "Several limitations of this study warrant consideration. First, our results have demonstrated the cardioprotection effect of Dar on MI- and I/R-induced cardiac insult may be attributed to the activation of AKT pathway. However, the inhibitors of AKT pathway were not administered in vivo in the presence of Dar, which would provide more conclusive evidence regarding the involvement of AKT in mediating the protection. Second, individual variability in Dar's efficacy may arise from host factors such as genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolism pathways [57]. Third, the complexity of the pathological microenvironment has the potential to compromise the efficacy of Dar. Hypoxia and matrix remodeling in areas of advanced myocardial fibrosis can impede drug penetration, thereby reducing its therapeutic effect [58]. Fourth, to further enhance the clinical translational value of Dar, further evaluation is necessary to ascertain whether Dar can elicit cardioprotective effects by modulating the AKT pathway in large animals, such as pigs, and in human myocardial (hiPSC-CMs) and organoid models.",
        "In conclusion, our screening found that the natural product Dar could significantly promote neonatal mouse cardiomyocyte proliferation and protect cardiomyocytes from ischemic and I/R injury in vitro. Furthermore, Dar was able to ameliorate MI- and I/R-induced cardiac injury in adult mice by reducing cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis. Mechanistically, our data revealed that Dar may protect heart against MI and I/R injury via activating AKT1 pathway. Taken together, our data provide a novel potential candidate for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.",

Circulation 139:e56-e66, 2019). MI occurs at an alarmingly high rate in the United States (approx. One case every 40 seconds), and the failure to repair damaged myocardium is the leading cause of recurrent heart attacks, heart failure (HF), and death within 5 years of MI (Benjamin, et al. Circulation 139:e56-e66, 2019). At present, HF represents an unmet need with no approved clinical therapies to replace the damaged myocardium. As the population ages, the number of heart failure patients is projected to increase, doubling the annual cost by 2030 (Benjamin, et al. Circulation 139:e56-e66, 2019). In the past decades, stem cell therapy has become a promising strategy for cardiac regeneration. However, stem cell-based therapy yielded modest success in human clinical trials.

In this study, we investigated the protective function of PrxⅢ in cardiomyocytes exposed to H/R stress, a widely used in vitro model to mimic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Using H9c2 cells and primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, we found that PrxⅢ knockdown significantly increased mitochondrial H 2 O 2 accumulation, leading to excessive mitochondrial fragmentation, impaired mitophagy, and reduced cell survival following H/R. Western blot analysis revealed that mitophagy regulators Parkin and BNIP3 were upregulated under moderate oxidative stress but were markedly suppressed in PrxⅢ-deficient cells after H/R, indicating that mitophagy activation is sensitive to the degree of oxidative stress. These findings were confirmed in vivo using mt-Keima transgenic mice, which showed significantly reduced mitophagic flux in PrxⅢ knockout hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion. In addition, PrxⅢ loss impaired lysosomal acidification and proteolytic activity, further contributing to defective autophagic flux. Re-expression of PrxⅢ restored mitochondrial morphology, mitophagy activity, and lysosome function, highlighting its central role in maintaining mitochondrial quality control (MQC).

        "Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of death, with an increasing prevalence worldwide. According to a 2020 epidemiological report, the global incidence of IHD is projected to rise to 1,845 cases per 100,000 individuals by 2030 [1]. IHD results from the blockage of coronary arteries, which compromises blood flow and causes oxygen and nutrient deprivation in myocardial tissue [2]. This ischemic damage can lead to myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and heart failure [3]. Over the past five years, the clinical and economic burden of IHD has grown significantly, including a 49 % increase in treatment-related healthcare costs [4], highlighting the urgent need for improved therapeutic strategies.",
        "Current treatment strategies focus on restoring coronary perfusion via pharmacological or surgical reperfusion therapies. However, the restoration of blood flow paradoxically exacerbates myocardial injury—a phenomenon known as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This additional damage is attributed to oxidative stress and calcium overload during the reoxygenation phase, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyocyte death [[5], [6], [7]]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated upon reactivation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain are considered the most critical mediators of I/R injury. Simultaneously, cytosolic calcium accumulation and pH normalization promote mitochondrial calcium influx and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, further amplifying ROS generation and cell death signaling [7,8]. Therefore, limiting oxidative damage by modulating mitochondrial ROS levels has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy in I/R injury. In vitro, hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) is widely used to recapitulate the molecular and cellular features of I/R injury, providing a reliable model for mechanistic studies of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.",
        "The heart requires considerable energy to sustain contraction and relaxation, and mitochondria occupy approximately 25–30 % of cardiomyocyte volume [9,10]. Therefore, mitochondrial damage resulting from I/R injury is a primary mechanism of cardiac dysfunction. Mitochondria produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, but this process also generates ROS, as approximately 1 % of electrons leak from the electron transport chain during respiration [11,12]. As a result, mitochondria are not only the main source of cellular energy but also the major site of intracellular ROS generation [13]. ROS include superoxide anion (O2•-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (•OH), and while physiological levels of ROS serve signaling roles, excessive ROS induce oxidative stress and cellular injury [14].",
        "Among ROS, H2O2 is of particular importance due to its chemical stability and uncharged nature, which allow it to diffuse across membranes and propagate oxidative stress. While H2O2 can act as a signaling molecule under physiological conditions, but excessive accumulation leads to cellular damage either directly or through conversion into more reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction [15,16]. In mitochondria, superoxide anions generated by the electron transport chain are rapidly converted to H2O2 by superoxide dismutases (SODs), primarily SOD2 in the matrix and SOD1 in the intermembrane space [17]. Although this enzymatic dismutation mitigates superoxide toxicity, it shifts the oxidative burden toward H2O2, making its efficient removal essential for maintaining redox balance.",
        "Several enzymes, including glutathione peroxidases (Gpx1 and GPx4) and peroxiredoxins (PrxⅢ and PrxV) are involved in mitochondrial H2O2 detoxification [18]. However, evidence suggests that PrxⅢ plays a dominant role in this process. PrxⅢ, a typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin localized exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix, exhibits high expression levels and superior catalytic efficiency for H2O2 due to its low Km and high turnover rate. These properties enable PrxⅢ to serve as the dominant mitochondrial H2O2 scavenger, responsible for approximately 90 % of its elimination in many cell types [19,20].Therefore, the functional integrity of PrxⅢ is critical for limiting mitochondrial oxidative stress and preventing H2O2-mediated damage under pathological conditions.",
        "Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) is also essential for maintaining mitochondrial function, particularly under stress conditions [21]. The MQC system includes mitochondrial fusion, fission, and mitophagy, which collectively regulate mitochondrial morphology and function [22]. Fusion promotes the mixing of mitochondrial contents, fission segregates damaged regions, and mitophagy eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria through selective autophagy [23,24]. Under physiological conditions, these processes operate in a tightly regulated balance. However, severe or prolonged oxidative stress can disrupt MQC, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Although recent studies suggest that MQC represents a promising therapeutic target in I/R injury, its precise role in ROS-mediated cardiomyocyte damage remains under debate [25,26].",
        "The cytoprotective functions of PrxⅢ have been well documented in various cell types. Nonn et al. demonstrated that PrxⅢ prevents hypoxia- and H2O2-induced apoptosis in cancer cells [27]. Our previous studies also confirmed that PrxⅢ plays a critical role in removing mitochondrial H2O2 and suppressing ROS-induced apoptosis. In HeLa cells, PrxⅢ knockdown resulted in ROS accumulation and mitochondrial damage–induced apoptosis [19], while in HaCaT keratinocytes, PrxⅢ suppression led to elevated mitochondrial H2O2 levels following UVB exposure, resulting in increased mitochondria-mediated apoptosis [28]. However, the role of PrxⅢ in regulating mitochondrial ROS and maintaining mitochondrial quality in cardiomyocytes under H/R stress remains unclear.",
        "In this study, we investigated whether PrxⅢ protects cardiomyocytes from H/R-induced injury by limiting mitochondrial H2O2 accumulation and preserving mitochondrial function. In addition to analyzing oxidative damage, we assessed alterations in mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagic flux, and cardiomyocyte viability. Our results suggest that PrxⅢ plays a protective role in cardiomyocytes under H/R stress by regulating mitochondrial ROS levels and supporting MQC pathways.",

Since uncharged H2O2 readily diffuses across mitochondrial membranes into the cytosol, we also evaluated intracellular H2O2 levels using the fluorescent probe PO-1. Consistent with mitochondrial findings, cytosolic H2O2 was also elevated following H/R and further increased in pSUPER-siPrxⅢ cells (Fig. 1E).

Given this cumulative macromolecular damage, we next investigated whether mitochondrial integrity and quality control processes—such as fission, fusion, and autophagy—were also disrupted under H/R stress in the absence of PrxⅢ.",
        "To investigate whether PrxⅢ depletion alters mitochondrial integrity under oxidative stress, we examined mitochondrial morphology following H/R exposure using MitoTracker CMX Red staining and confocal microscopy. In pSUPER-siPrxⅢ cells, mitochondrial branch length was significantly shortened after H/R, indicating increased mitochondrial fragmentation, whereas no such change was observed in pSUPER controls (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with the established role of oxidative stress in promoting mitochondrial fission and impairing fusion [21,26].Fig. 3PrxⅢ depletion enhances mitochondrial fragmentation under H/R stress in cardiomyocytes.(A) Mitochondrial morphology was assessed in pSUPER and pSUPER-siPrxⅢ cells following 1 h of hypoxia and 4 h of reoxygenation (H/R).

        "To complement these findings, we analyzed mitochondrial aspect ratios as an additional morphological parameter. A shift toward lower aspect ratio values—reflecting more rounded and fragmented mitochondria—was observed in PrxⅢ-deficient cells under H/R (Fig. 3A, far right). This quantitative metric further supports enhanced mitochondrial fission in the absence of PrxⅢ.",
        "Since mitochondrial shape is dynamically regulated by the balance of fission and fusion processes, we next examined the expression of key regulatory proteins. Western blot analysis revealed that expression of the outer membrane fusion protein Mfn1 and the inner membrane protein OPA1, was moderately increased in PrxⅢ-depleted cells under normoxic conditions, but significantly decreased following H/R exposure (Fig. 3B). This suggests a possible compensatory upregulation of fusion pathways in response to basal oxidative stress, which fails under more severe oxidative conditions [41].",
        "We then evaluated phosphorylation of Drp1, the key mitochondrial fission mediator. Phosphorylation at Ser637, which inhibits Drp1 translocation to mitochondria, was significantly reduced in PrxⅢ-deficient cells after H/R. In contrast, phosphorylation at Ser616, which promotes Drp1 recruitment and oligomerization, was slightly increased following H/R but did not significantly differ between groups (Fig. 3C). These findings align with prior reports showing that redox-dependent signaling regulates Drp1 activity primarily via Ser637 dephosphorylation under stress conditions [42].",
        "Together, these findings indicate that PrxⅢ deficiency enhances mitochondrial fragmentation following H/R injury by downregulating mitochondrial fusion proteins and facilitating Drp1-dependent fission via loss of inhibitory Ser637 phosphorylation. This imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics may impair MQC and contribute to increased vulnerability to oxidative stress in PrxⅢ-deficient cardiomyocytes.",
        "To determine whether PrxⅢ deficiency affects autophagy under H/R conditions, we first evaluated the formation of autophagosomes using LC3B immunoblotting. Conversion of LC3-I to the lipidated LC3-II form, a marker of autophagosome maturation [43], was significantly decreased in pSUPER-siPrxⅢ cells after H/R compared to pSUPER controls (Fig. 4A). Consistently, confocal imaging of GFP-LC3 revealed a marked reduction in puncta formation in PrxⅢ-depleted cells, whereas GFP-LC3 puncta markedly increased in pSUPER cells following H/R (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest impaired autophagosome formation in the absence of PrxⅢ.Fig. 4PrxⅢ depletion inhibits autophagosome formation and suppresses autophagy flux under H/R stress in cardiomyocytes.(A) pSUPER and pSUPER-siPrxⅢ cells were subjected to 1 h of hypoxia followed by 4 h of reoxygenation (H/R).

        "To assess whether these defects extend to autophagic flux, we measured levels of SQSTM1/p62, a substrate degraded during autolysosome formation [44,45]. p62 protein expression decreased after H/R in pSUPER cells, consistent with efficient autophagic flux, whereas it accumulated in pSUPER-siPrxⅢ cells (Fig. 4A), indicating impaired autophagic progression.",
        "To further visualize autophagic flux, cells were transduced with a tandem fluorescent-tagged mCherry-GFP-LC3 construct. In this system, yellow puncta represent autophagosomes (GFP and mCherry dual signal), while red-only puncta represent autolysosomes, as GFP is quenched in the acidic lysosomal environment [34]. Following H/R, the number of autolysosomes (red puncta) increased in control cells, while this increase was significantly blunted in PrxⅢ-deficient cells (Fig. 4C), reinforcing the conclusion that autophagic flux is impaired in the absence of PrxⅢ.",
        "We next examined the expression of mitophagy-related proteins, including Parkin and BNIP3, which are critical regulators of mitochondrial clearance under stress conditions [46,47]. Both proteins were upregulated under basal conditions in PrxⅢ-deficient cells, suggesting a compensatory response to elevated mitochondrial stress. However, following H/R, the expression of both Parkin and BNIP3 increased in control cells but was reduced in pSUPER-siPrxⅢ cells (Fig. 4D), supporting the notion of defective mitophagy in the absence of PrxⅢ.",
        "Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PrxⅢ depletion disrupts both autophagosome formation and downstream autophagic flux under H/R conditions in cardiomyocytes.",
        "To further investigate the mechanism underlying impaired autophagic flux in PrxⅢ-deficient cells, we examined lysosomal function, as this is a key determinant of autolysosome formation and substrate clearance. Given the observed reduction in autolysosome formation in PrxⅢ-depleted cells (Fig. 4C), we hypothesized that lysosomal dysfunction might contribute to defective autophagy under H/R stress. Recent studies have shown that elevated ROS can compromise lysosomal activity and interfere with autophagosome–lysosome fusion [48,49].",
        "We first assessed lysosomal protease activity using Magic Red, a fluorogenic substrate for cathepsin B.

Based on these findings, we selected 8 h of reoxygenation as the standard condition for subsequent apoptotic assessments. Under this condition, the percentage of annexin V- and/or PI-positive cells was significantly higher in PrxⅢ-deficient cardiomyocytes compared to controls (Fig. 6C).

        "To extend the relevance of our findings beyond the H9c2 cell model, we assessed the impact of PrxⅢ deficiency in primary cardiomyocytes and in vivo heart tissues. Primary cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal PrxⅢ WT and KO mice were subjected to H/R stress. Consistent with our earlier in vitro results, mitochondrial H2O2 levels were significantly elevated under H/R conditions, with a markedly greater increase observed in PrxⅢ KO cells compared to WT controls (Fig. 11A). These findings confirm that PrxⅢ loss enhances mitochondrial oxidative stress in primary cardiomyocytes.Fig. 11PrxⅢ deficiency exacerbates mitochondrial ROS production, structural damage, and mitophagy impairment in cardiomyocytes and ischemic hearts.(A) Mitochondrial H2O2 levels were measured in primary cardiomyocytes isolated from wild-type (PrxⅢ WT) and PrxⅢ knockout (PrxⅢ KO) neonatal mice subjected to hypoxia (1 h) and reoxygenation (4 h).

        "To further explore the physiological relevance in an in vivo setting, we employed a murine model of myocardial I/R injury using 10-week-old PrxⅢ WT and KO mice. Electron microscopy of heart tissue collected 24 h after I/R revealed a significantly higher density of structurally damaged mitochondria in PrxⅢ KO hearts, consistent with increased mitochondrial vulnerability (Fig. 11B).",
        "We next evaluated mitophagy using mt-Keima reporter mice. PrxⅢ KO hearts exhibited a marked reduction in red-to-green fluorescence shift following I/R, indicating impaired mitophagy (Fig. 11C). These in vivo findings are in line with our previous cellular observations of disrupted autophagic flux and downregulation of mitophagy regulators in PrxⅢ-deficient cells (see Fig. 4). Together, these results reinforce the role of PrxⅢ as a key mitochondrial antioxidant that safeguards mitophagy competence and mitochondrial integrity under ischemic stress.",
        "Cardiac I/R injury is a multifactorial pathology characterized by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Among the ROS generated during reperfusion, H2O2 plays a central pathogenic role due to its membrane-permeable and signaling-capable nature [51]. In this study, we investigated the cardioprotective role of mitochondrial PrxⅢ against H/R-induced oxidative damage and explored its functional relationship with MQC.",
        "Our findings expand upon previous reports, such as that by Nonn et al. [27], which demonstrated the anti-apoptotic role of PrxⅢ in cancer cells. Here, we extend its protective function into the cardiac setting, confirming that PrxⅢ effectively reduces mitochondrial H2O2 levels, preserves organelle integrity, and suppresses apoptosis in cardiomyocytes under oxidative stress.",
        "While ROS play both signaling and damaging roles, excessive mitochondrial H2O2 disrupts MQC mechanisms including mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and lysosome function. Notably, we observed that electrically neutral H2O2 diffused from mitochondria to the cytosol, thereby amplifying oxidative damage beyond the mitochondrial compartment (Fig. 1). This suggests that PrxⅢ not only limits mitochondrial oxidative stress but also serves as a barrier to secondary cytosolic ROS propagation.",
        "Mitochondria dynamically regulate their morphology through fusion and fission processes, which are essential components of MQC. Interestingly, under normoxic conditions, PrxⅢ-deficient cardiomyocytes exhibited increased expression of fusion proteins Mfn1 and OPA1, suggesting a compensatory response to mild oxidative stress. This adaptive mechanism may reflect a lower threshold for redox-induced mitochondrial fusion aimed at preserving organelle function. However, under severe oxidative stress such as H/R, these fusion-related proteins were significantly downregulated, resulting in pronounced mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 3). This biphasic response highlights the presence of distinct adaptive thresholds governing mitochondrial dynamics. Under moderate oxidative stress, fusion is promoted to counteract damage, whereas excessive oxidative burden overwhelms fusion capacity and shifts the balance toward fission. These findings are in agreement with previous studies reporting context-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics in response to redox cues [22,24,52].",
        "Mitochondrial fission is largely orchestrated by Drp1. Our results revealed that phosphorylation at the inhibitory site Ser637 was markedly reduced in PrxⅢ-deficient cells following H/R, facilitating Drp1 translocation to mitochondria and promoting fission. In contrast, phosphorylation at Ser616—typically associated with Drp1 activation—remained unchanged (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that mitochondrial fragmentation observed in our model primarily stems from reduced inhibitory control rather than enhanced activation of Drp1, further supporting the idea that oxidative stress drives mitochondrial fission via derepression mechanisms. This mechanism aligns with prior findings implicating Ser637 dephosphorylation as a key redox-sensitive switch in mitochondrial dynamics [53].",
        "Mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy, is essential for MQC as it ensures the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. It proceeds through three key steps—initiation of phagophore formation, recognition of damaged mitochondria, and fusion with lysosomes—all of which are sensitive to redox imbalance. ROS have been shown to impair multiple stages of mitophagy. For example, oxidation of autophagy-related proteins by ROS interferes with phagophore elongation and LC3 lipidation, thereby disrupting the early stages of autophagosome formation [54].",
        "Damaged mitochondria are typically recognized and sequestered via adaptor- and receptor-mediated mechanisms. The PINK1/Parkin pathway represents a key adaptor-based mechanism. Consistent with our previous findings demonstrating that PrxⅢ interacts with and stabilizes PINK1 under stress conditions [35], the present study confirmed that Parkin expression was elevated under moderate oxidative stress (i.e., PrxⅢ knockdown or H/R in wild-type cells), suggesting initiation of mitophagic clearance. However, under conditions of combined PrxⅢ deficiency and H/R stress—when mitochondrial H2O2 reached critical levels—Parkin expression markedly declined. This supports the idea that excessive ROS suppress mitophagy signaling, as previously proposed [55,56].",
        "BNIP3, a representative receptor in the LC3-interacting region (LIR)-mediated pathway, showed a similar biphasic pattern. While BNIP3 increased after H/R in control cells, its expression was reduced in PrxⅢ-deficient cardiomyocytes, again implying that excessive mitochondrial ROS blocks mitophagy at the recognition stage. These results suggest that mitochondrial H2O2 levels act as a rheostat: low to moderate ROS levels induce mitophagy as a compensatory survival mechanism, whereas excessive ROS inhibit this clearance process. This is consistent with previous studies showing ROS-sensitive biphasic regulation of mitophagy [57].",
        "To verify these findings beyond protein expression levels, we employed mt-Keima reporter mice to directly monitor mitophagy in vivo. The pH-sensitive fluorescence shift of mt-Keima from green (neutral pH) to red (acidic lysosomal pH) enables reliable tracking of mitochondrial degradation. We observed significantly attenuated red-to-green conversion in PrxⅢ knockout mouse hearts following I/R injury (Fig. 11C), indicating that PrxⅢ is indispensable for maintaining mitophagy flux under physiological ischemic stress conditions.",
        "Finally, we examined whether the third step of mitophagy—fusion of mitophagosomes with lysosomes to form mitolysosomes—was also impaired. Lysosomal acidity and cathepsin activity were both significantly compromised in PrxⅢ-deficient cardiomyocytes under H/R, impairing autophagic clearance. Co-localization of LC3-positive autophagosomes with LAMP1-positive lysosomes was also reduced. Restoration of PrxⅢ rescued these defects, demonstrating that PrxⅢ not only regulates mitochondrial redox balance but also preserves lysosome function necessary for completion of mitophagy.",
        "Importantly, our in vivo and primary cardiomyocyte data validated these mechanisms under physiological conditions. Primary cardiomyocytes isolated from PrxⅢ KO mice exhibited increased mitochondrial ROS accumulation following H/R stress, and adult KO mice subjected to myocardial I/R injury showed elevated mitochondrial fragmentation and defective mitophagy (Fig. 11A–C). The concordant findings from both H9c2 cells and PrxⅢ KO mice provide strong evidence that PrxⅢ is a critical regulator of redox homeostasis and MQC during cardiac stress.",
        "In conclusion, our study demonstrates that PrxⅢ is a critical regulator of mitochondrial redox homeostasis and MQC in cardiomyocytes under H/R stress. By limiting mitochondrial H2O2 accumulation, PrxⅢ preserves mitochondrial morphology, supports mitophagic clearance, and maintains lysosomal integrity. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how mitochondrial antioxidants shape the cardiomyocyte response to ischemic injury and suggest that enhancing PrxⅢ function may represent a novel therapeutic approach in I/R-related cardiac disease.",
        "This study demonstrates that PrxⅢ is a critical determinant of mitochondrial redox homeostasis and cardiomyocyte survival under H/R stress. By effectively scavenging mitochondrial H2O2, PrxⅢ preserves mitochondrial structure, supports MQC, and maintains lysosomal function. PrxⅢ deficiency leads to excessive mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress, resulting in disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitophagic flux, and lysosomal dysfunction. These effects collectively contribute to mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Restoration of PrxⅢ expression reverses these defects, highlighting its essential role in protecting cardiomyocytes from H/R-induced injury. Our findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of PrxⅢ may offer a promising strategy to combat ischemia/reperfusion-related cardiac damage by reinforcing the antioxidant and organelle-protective machinery of mitochondria.",

This study uses a porcine model to provide proof-of-concept evidence that a combination of amiodarone and ivabradine can effectively suppress EA. None of the nine treated subjects experienced the primary endpoint of cardiac death, unstable EA, or heart failure compared with five out of eight (62.5%) in the control cohort (hazard ratio = 0.00; 95% confidence interval: 0–0.297; p = 0.002). Pharmacologic treatment of EA may be a viable strategy to improve safety and allow further clinical development of cardiac remuscularization therapy.",

        "Ischemic heart disease, including myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure, remains the leading cause of death in the United States and around the world. Approximately one billion cardiomyocytes are permanently lost during MI and an increasing proportion of MI survivors—an estimated 20% to 30% (Velagaleti et al., 2008)—later develop heart failure. Current treatments can slow the initiation and progression of heart failure, but none replaces lost myocardium, short of orthotopic heart transplantation, which remains restricted in availability and indication (Nakamura and Murry, 2019). Human pluripotent stem cells ([hPSCs], comprising embryonic stem cells [ESCs] and their reprogrammed cousins, induced pluripotent stem cells [iPSCs]) are a renewable source of cardiomyocytes (CMs). Transplantation of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) into infarcted myocardium of small animals—mice, rats, and guinea pigs—has shown stable engraftment (Caspi et al., 2007; Laflamme et al., 2007; Shiba et al., 2012, 2014; van Laake et al., 2007). More recently, our group and others have shown remuscularization and functional benefit in infarcted non-human primates (NHPs) following transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (Chong et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2018; Shiba et al., 2016). In addition to functional remuscularization, the human graft vascularizes and electromechanically couples with the host myocardium within 1 month post-transplant and remains durable up to 3 months, the longest time tested.",
        "Although no arrhythmias were observed in smaller animals, we and others consistently observe ventricular arrhythmias following hPSC-CM transplantation in NHPs (Chong et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2018; Shiba et al., 2016) and pigs (Romagnuolo et al., 2019), which we have called “engraftment arrhythmias” (EAs). EAs are generally transient, occurring within a week of transplantation and typically resolve spontaneously after approximately 1 month. Based on electrical mapping, overdrive pacing, and cardioversion studies, EAs appear to originate focally in the graft or peri-graft myocardium and function as automatous foci rather than reentrant pathways (Liu et al., 2018; Romagnuolo et al., 2019). Although EA is reasonably well tolerated in NHPs, the Laflamme group (Romagnuolo et al., 2019) reported that EA can be lethal in pigs. For this reason, EA has emerged as the biggest impediment to the clinical translation of human cardiomyocyte transplantation (Eschenhagen et al., 2017).",
        "We hypothesized that the risk of EA may be mitigated by treatment with clinically available antiarrhythmic drugs. Because the pig shows heightened sensitivity to EAs, is a well-established model in cardiovascular research (Lelovas et al., 2014) and cell therapy (van der Spoel et al., 2011), whose larger heart permits the use of percutaneous delivery catheters, we chose to test the hypothesis in this large animal model. In the first phase of our study, we screened a panel of seven antiarrhythmic agents. The broad-acting (class III) antiarrhythmic amiodarone and the pacemaker inhibitor (class 0) ivabradine emerged independently as the most promising agents for control of rhythm and rate, respectively. We therefore performed a second phase to test the effect of combined amiodarone and ivabradine treatment. We found that this regimen reduced sudden cardiac death, as well as suppressed tachycardia and arrhythmia.",
        "A flow chart for all subjects in the study is shown in Figure 1 and clinical summaries are provided in Table 1. No significant arrhythmias were noted in the two untreated sham transplant control subjects (9 and 10) that underwent MI and percutaneous intracardiac injection of vehicle. All subjects that received human cardiomyocyte grafts developed EA between 2 and 6 days following cell transplantation. Initiation of EA was characterized by salvos of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), and this typically progressed to periods of sustained VT with rates ranging from 110 to 250 bpm (Figure 2). The VT was often polymorphic, with the same subject showing different electrical axes and both wide and narrow complex tachycardia at different times. In four of the eight untreated subjects, EA was either fatal or necessitated euthanasia due to a prespecified endpoint of unstable tachycardia (defined as sustained heart rate >350 bpm). In one additional untreated case (subject 12), acute heart failure was noted clinically after a week of EA at a persistent rate of 300 bpm and, based on recommendations from veterinary staff, the subject was euthanized. Signs of heart failure were subsequently confirmed on necropsy. In all other cases, EA was noted with a rapid acceleration to >350 bpm (subjects 11 and 14) and, in two cases, deterioration to ventricular fibrillation (VF) prior to euthanasia (subjects 1 and 2) (Table 1). Three out of four arrhythmic endpoints occurred within the first 3 days of developing EA, and they occurred when tachyarrhythmia was nearly constant. Mean heart rate peaked at day 8 post-transplantation and thereafter began to decline, whereas the arrhythmia burden plateaued from days 8 to 16 and began to normalize thereafter. Of the three survivors in the untreated cohort, two did not normalize rhythm and experienced, on average, 42% arrhythmia burden at the end of study (subjects 17 and 19). The single subject in the untreated cohort that normalized heart rate and rhythm did so on post-transplant day 25 (subject 13).Figure 1Flowchart of the study designPhase 1 consisted of nine total subjects, four untreated with any antiarrhythmic to study the natural history of EA and five used to screen seven candidate antiarrhythmic agents. Amiodarone and ivabradine were found to have promising signals of effect and advanced for further study. Phase 2 consisted of 19 total subjects: 9 treated with amiodarone and ivabradine and 8 untreated following hESC-CM transplantation, and 2 untreated following sham transplantation.Table 1Characteristics of study subjects and clinical historySubjectAge (days)Weight (kg)MICell lineApproachhESC-CM cTnT (%)hESC-CM viability (%)Infarct size (%)aGraft size (%)bGraft mass (g)LV mass (g)HR (bpm)Arrhythmia burden (% of time)OutcomeDay 7Day 30Day 7Day 30Treated323134.7yesH7Surg98896.85.40.5125.973N/A2.0N/Aeuthanasia, day 26 (PCP)422732.0yesH7Perc98898.27.30.8137.9939486.097.8survival523633.0yesRUES2Perc91897.19.00.584.01638125.60.5survival623133.4yesRUES2Perc919010.11.40.194.2100N/A47.1N/Aeuthanasia, day 19 (pCMV)723037.0yesRUES2Perc91939.60.30.0142.7897945.828.2survival829933.5yesRUES2Perc868815.93.40.8153.3737767.64.7survival1527133.0yesRUES2Perc898810.94.20.5113.4797635.444.9survival1626334.0yesRUES2Perc888514.60.70.1136.7746943.97.6survival1838032.5yesRUES2Perc94759.33.70.5144.569781.61.6survivalAvg ± SEM263.1 ± 16.833.7 ± 0.592 ± 187 ± 210.3 ± 13.9 ± 10.4 ± 0.1125.8 ± 890 ± 1079 ± 339.5 ± 9.226.5 ± 13.4Untreated126732.0noH7Surg9888N/AN/A0.375.10328N/A100.0N/Aprimary endpoint day 7 (VF)231432.0yesH7Surg98905.85.60.392.80120N/A62.7N/Aprimary endpoint day 19 (VF)1128435.0yesRUES2Perc869013.21.00.2134.9N/AN/AN/AN/Aprimary endpoint day 5 (EA)1228333.5yesRUES2Perc82879.71.10.1112.4166N/A94.0N/Aprimary endpoint day 12 (EA/HF)1329235.5yesRUES2Perc878316.51.70.3107.41628395.91.9survival1427033.0yesRUES2Perc87904.69.10.493.2N/AN/AN/AN/Aprimary endpoint day 6 (EA)1720933.0yesRUES2Perc987013.50.40.1104.310611549.175.7survival1919233.5yesRUES2Perc92745.43.60.3139.2988471.551.7survivalAvg ± SEM263.9 ± 14.833.4 ± 0.491 ± 284 ± 39.8 ± 1.83.2 ± 1.20.2 ± 0107.4 ± 7.6163 ± 3594 ± 1178.9 ± 8.543.1 ± 21.7p valuec0.970.730.770.310.820.640.080.120.030.090.010.52Sham transplant control924933.5yesN/APercN/AN/A–N/AN/AN/A71680.80.0survival1023333.0yesN/APercN/AN/A–N/AN/AN/A77691.20.8survivalAvg ± SEM241 ± 833.3 ± 0.374 ± 369 ± 11.0 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.4bpm, beats per minute; CK, cytokeratin; EA, engraftment arrhythmia; hESC-CM, human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes; HF, heart failure; HR, heart rate; MI, myocardial infarction; N/A, not applicable; surg, surgery; PCP, Pneumocystis pneumonia; pCMV, porcine cytomegalovirus; perc, percutaneous; VF, ventricular fibrillation.a% of left ventricle.b% of infarct area.cTreated versus untreated.Figure 2Variable morphologies of EA in a single minipigExamples of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and three morphologies of EA resembling accelerated junctional rhythm (AJR), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) were observed in a single untreated subject (12).

        "In phase 1 of the study, we screened six canonical antiarrhythmic agents broadly targeting sodium channels, potassium channels, and β-adrenergic receptors: lidocaine (class Ib Vaughan-Williams-Singh antiarrhythmic, sodium channel inhibitor), flecainide (Ic, sodium channel inhibitor), propafenone (Ic, sodium channel inhibitor), amiodarone (III, potassium channel inhibitor), sotalol (III, potassium channel inhibitor), and metoprolol (β1-adrenergic receptor inhibitor) for effect on EA heart rate and rhythm. In addition, the funny current/HCN4 channel antagonist, ivabradine, was tested (Table S1). This series was not meant to be comprehensive but rather to rapidly identify candidate agents. Animals were brought into the laboratory while in EA, anesthetized, and the effects of short-term intravenous infusion or oral treatment of antiarrhythmic agents were studied. In three instances, intravenous amiodarone successfully cardioverted unstable EA from >350 bpm to a lower heart rate, typically including brief episodes of sinus rhythm (Figure 3A). Oral ivabradine demonstrated robust dose-dependent effects on heart rate but did not restore sinus rhythm (Figure 3B). Four of the other drugs had no significant effect in this screen (lidocaine, flecainide, sotalol, and metoprolol). Propafenone briefly reduced heart rate and restored sinus rhythm in two-drug challenges, but this drug was associated with substantial gastrointestinal toxicity and not studied further (data not shown).Figure 3Acute effects of amiodarone and ivabradine on engraftment arrhythmiaAmiodarone was effective as an intravenous bolus to cardiovert engraftment arrythmia to normal sinus or a lower heart rate transiently in three separate instances (A) (red line).

        "Given their distinct mechanisms of action and complementary effects on heart rate and rhythm, we formally tested the hypothesis that amiodarone along with ivabradine would reduce a combined primary endpoint of cardiac death, unstable EA >350 bpm, and heart failure in phase 2 of the study. A total of nine treated, eight untreated, and two sham transplant subjects were enrolled in the study with similar baseline and cell transplantation characteristics (Table 1). As detailed in the experimental procedures, treated animals received bolus and maintenance doses of amiodarone, and ivabradine was given as needed to keep heart rates <150 bpm. All treated subjects survived without the primary cardiac endpoint compared with 3/8 (37.5%) of untreated subjects (Figure 4A). The hazard ratio of the primary endpoint was 0.000 (95% CI: 0.000–0.297; p = 0.002) with antiarrhythmic treatment. Of note, two of the treated subjects (3 and 6) experienced non-cardiac death at post-transplant days 26 and 19 due to immunosuppression-related complications (Pneumocystis pneumonia and porcine cytomegalovirus, respectively). Intention-to-treat analysis of overall survival also favored the treated cohort with hazard ratio of 0.212 (95% CI: 0.030–1.007; p = 0.05) (Figure 4B).Figure 4Antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone and ivabradine for engraftment arrhythmia in pig(A) Kaplan-Meier curve for freedom from primary outcome of cardiac death, unstable EA or heart failure was significantly improved in the treated (n = 9) compared with the untreated cohort (n = 8, p = 0.002).

        "Pooled and individual subject-level data of heart rate and arrhythmia burden are provided in Figures 5A–5D, respectively. The average heart rate was significantly lower with antiarrhythmic treatment compared with no treatment. Mean heart rates peaked at post-transplantation day 7 in untreated animals at 163 ± 35 bpm, versus average heart rates of 90 ± 10 bpm in the treated cohort (p = 0.03) (Table 1; Figure 5A). Heart rate in the treated animals was not significantly different than the normal resting heart rate before MI and transplant (84 ± 1 bpm, p = 0.21). Following transplantation, peak daily heart rate for the study duration averaged 305 ± 29 bpm in untreated animals, whereas treatment significantly attenuated peak heart rate to 185 ± 9 bpm (p = 0.001) (Figure 5E). We defined arrhythmia burden as the percentage of the day spent in arrhythmia. Treatment reduced peak arrhythmia burden from 96.8% ± 2.9% to 78.1% ± 7.2% (p = 0.04), and the average daily burden was reduced from 61.4 ± 7.1% to 27.1 ± 7.0% (p = 0.004) (Figure 5F).

In these four animals, heart rates were well controlled irrespective of treatment, and they survived until the study's completion.

The average infarct size for the treated and untreated cohorts were comparable at 10.3% ± 1% and 9.8% ± 1.8% of the left ventricle, respectively (p = 0.82). Graft size relative to infarct size was also comparable at 3.9% ± 1% and 3.2% ± 1.2% for treated and untreated subjects, respectively (p = 0.64). Delivery of hESC-CM successfully targeted the peri-infarct border zone and central ischemic regions as intended and resulted in discrete hPSC-CM grafts transplanted into host myocardium, as reported previously (Chong et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2018; Romagnuolo et al., 2019; Shiba et al., 2016). All grafts localized to the anterior, antero-septal, and antero-lateral walls and, as previously reported in pig (Romagnuolo et al., 2019), appeared structurally immature at early time points before 2 weeks post-transplantation with increasing maturity up to the end of study.",
        "The narrow complex tachycardia that resembles accelerated junctional rhythm (Figure 2) was not observed in our previous NHP studies (Chong et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2018) but was common in the minipig. Pigs are known to have an extensive Purkinje fiber network that extends transmurally throughout the ventricular myocardium, whereas in macaques and humans the Purkinje network is subendocardial (Garcia-Bustos et al., 2017; Panescu et al., 2014). We hypothesized that narrow complex VT resulted from graft automaticity conducting through intramural Purkinje fibers and propagating to the rest of the ventricle. Histology confirmed the mesh-like network of intramural Purkinje fibers throughout the minipig left ventricle (Figure S4A; Video S1). There were multiple examples of hESC-CM grafts in direct contact with these intramural branches of the Purkinje system (Figure 6; Video S2). We used connexin 40 (Cx40) immunostaining to specifically stain Purkinje fiber gap junctions (Garcia-Bustos et al., 2017; Pallante et al., 2010), and confirmed their identity by their reduced myofibril content and the absence of T tubules (Figure S4B). This supports the hypothesis that the pig's unique Purkinje network anatomy contributes to narrow complex EA.Figure 6Transplanted hESC-CM grafts interact with a diffuse Purkinje conduction system in the porcine myocardiumAn hPSC-cardiomyocyte graft 2 weeks post-transplantation, marked by human-specific slow skeletal cardiac troponin I (ssTnI) (red) (Bedada et al., 2014), interacts with Cx40-positive (white) Purkinje fibers.

        "Intramyocardial transplantation of hPSC-CMs is a promising strategy to remuscularize the infarcted heart and restore function (Nakamura and Murry, 2019). Such a therapy to prevent and treat heart failure would be a seminal advance in addressing a large unmet clinical need. Studies in large animals have demonstrated long-term efficacy but also defined a significant safety signal of generally transient but potentially fatal arrhythmias. As demonstrated in earlier studies (Liu et al., 2018; Romagnuolo et al., 2019; Shiba et al., 2016), EA is a predictable complication of cardiac remuscularization therapy for MI (Yu et al., 2019). In the NHPs, EA typically presents as a wide complex tachycardia with a variable electrical axis (Chong et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2018), and this was reproduced in the minipig recently by the Laflamme laboratory (Romagnuolo et al., 2019). Here, we further describe EA as polymorphic and interpret the changes in electrical axis as ectopy originating from different graft foci. Interestingly, in the pig we also observed a narrow complex VT that alternated with a wide complex tachycardia, a pattern not seen in the NHPs. Histology of native and grafted porcine myocardium supports the hypothesis that the wide complex beats originate from grafts interacting with the working cardiac myocytes with slow conduction, and that the narrow complex beats originate when grafts interact with the intramural Purkinje fibers that diffusely permeate the porcine heart (Garcia-Bustos et al., 2017; Panescu et al., 2014).",
        "All 17 subjects transplanted with 500 × 106 hESC-CMs demonstrated significant burden of arrhythmia that, while typically transient, was associated with high mortality in pigs. We observed higher morbidity and mortality related to EA than the recent study by Laflamme and colleagues (Romagnuolo et al., 2019), perhaps reflecting differences in our animal model including the use of Yucatan minipigs, percutaneous cell delivery, or our cell product. Our experience with this model suggests two primary mechanisms of cardiac morbidity. Firstly, rapid EA >350 bpm often degenerates to fatal VF and, secondly, heart failure commonly ensues in pigs with chronic tachycardia >230 bpm (Chow et al., 1990). Consequently, our primary endpoint included these parameters to limit excessive mortality in our antiarrhythmic trial.",
        "Combined antiarrhythmic treatment with baseline amiodarone and adjunctive ivabradine safely prevented the combined primary endpoint of cardiac death, unstable EA, and heart failure in all treated subjects, indicating that the risk of EA may be mitigated through pharmacology. Treatment was associated with significantly decreased peak tachycardia and arrhythmia. Once subjects experienced sustained improvement in arrhythmia burden, termed electrical maturation, antiarrhythmic therapy was successfully withdrawn in all subjects. Thus, short-term amiodarone and ivabradine treatment promoted electrical stability until the grafts became less arrhythmogenic.",
        "The mechanism of benefit for our antiarrhythmic treatment may be related to suppression of automaticity, reducing both heart rate and arrhythmia burden. The drugs were particularly beneficial during the early phase of EA, which carries the greatest risk of deterioration to VF. Electrophysiological studies performed by our group and the Laflamme laboratory in NHPs (Liu et al., 2018) and pig (Romagnuolo et al., 2019), respectively, suggests that the etiology of EA is increased focal automaticity, rather than macro-reentry typically observed with clinical VT (Josephson et al., 1984). In our study, cardioversion was unsuccessful in terminating EA. As EA became unstable in the untreated animals, heart rates rapidly accelerated to >350 bpm, and we cannot exclude the possibility that this escalation could have a distinct mechanism, e.g., automaticity leading to reentry. This may explain why treatment successfully suppressed unstable and fatal arrhythmias but was unable to prevent EA altogether.",
        "The efficacy of ivabradine to rate control EA suggests that its pharmacologic target, the If current carried by the HCN4 channel, which is highly expressed in immature cardiomyocytes and hPSC-CMs (Karbassi et al., 2020), may be an important mediator. Ivabradine, by itself, never abrogated EA, suggesting that, while the If current can accelerate the rate of EAs, If is not the current responsible for generating the ventricular automaticity triggered by engraftment. In contrast, amiodarone reduced the burden of EA chronically and clearly restored sinus rhythm in some acute infusion experiments (Figure 3). Although classified principally as a K+ channel blocker (class III), amiodarone is well known also to antagonize Na+ channels, Ca2+ channels, and β-adrenergic receptors (Waks and Zimetbaum, 2017). Thus, it is difficult to gain insights into the mechanism of EA from amiodarone's efficacy. The disappearance of EA coincides with maturation of the stem cell-derived graft (Chong et al., 2014; Kadota et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018), and we with others have hypothesized that the window of arrhythmogenicity may reflect a period of in vivo graft maturation before reaching a state more similar to host myocardium (Guo and Pu, 2020; Ichimura et al., 2020; Kannan and Kwon, 2020; Karbassi et al., 2020; Marchiano et al., 2019; Maroli and Braun, 2020). Additional strategies such as promoting maturation before transplantation, gene editing, and modulating host/cell interaction may provide additional means of arrhythmia control and a comprehensive protocol invoking multiple complementary mechanisms of action may ultimately be necessary to ensure safety. Further investigation of the etiology of EA would be accelerated by the development of higher throughput in vivo, ex vivo, in vitro, and/or in silico platforms to perform genetic, pharmacological, electrophysiological, and/or modeling studies before phenotyping in large animal models.",
        "EA is the most significant barrier to clinical translation of cardiac remuscularization therapy. The natural history of EA emerging from the NHPs and more recent porcine data suggests that, once EA resolves, there is low risk for further arrhythmia. This study provides a proof-of-concept that clinically relevant antiarrhythmic drug treatment can successfully suppress fatal arrhythmias and control tachycardia to achieve electrical quiescence. This could be an important tool toward reaching an acceptable safety profile for clinical development.",
        "While this study demonstrates that EA is responsive to pharmacologic suppression, there are several limitations. Notably, our proposed regimen did not completely abrogate EA and several treated subjects experienced significant, but not fatal, arrhythmia. As such, adjunctive methods may be desirable to further mitigate risk from EA to patients. Possible strategies may include promoting maturation and modification of hESC-CMs as well as dosing and delivery protocols to be less arrhythmogenic. This study would also benefit from longer follow-up to establish the long-term effectiveness of EA mitigation. We did not randomize enrollment of animals or assess whether sex is a biological variable. Although we took pains to administer clinically relevant doses of amiodarone and ivabradine, we cannot exclude the possibility that EA in itself is dependent on the dose of cells transplanted. The dose utilized is comparable with that utilized to demonstrate long-term function benefit in NHPs (500 × 106 versus 750 × 106 hESC-CMs, respectively) (Liu et al., 2018), but dosing studies have not been reported. Future studies will also ideally include functional endpoints to determine mechanical efficacy with background guideline-directed medical therapy, such as inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and β-adrenergic systems.",
        "In this study utilizing a porcine infarction model of cardiac remuscularization therapy, EA was universally observed and associated with significant mortality. Chronic amiodarone treatment combined with adjunctive ivabradine successfully prevented the combined primary endpoint of cardiac death, unstable EA, and heart failure. Overall survival was significantly improved with antiarrhythmic treatment and associated with heart rate and rhythm control. The mechanisms of EA remain incompletely understood and merit concerted scientific inquiry.",
        "These studies were approved by the University of Washington Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee. Two lines of hESCs were used in this study. Initial subjects received H7 (WiCell)-derived cardiomyocytes that were cultured, expanded, and differentiated in suspension culture format by collaborators at the Center for Applied Technology Development at the City of Hope in California, all as described previously (Chen et al., 2015; Chong et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2018). Most subjects received RUES2 (Rockefeller University)-derived cardiomyocytes produced in our laboratory in stirred suspension culture format. In brief, RUES2 hESCs were cultured to form aggregates and were expanded in commercially available medium (Essential 8, Gibco). For cardiac differentiation, suspension-adapted pluripotent aggregates were induced to differentiate in RPMI-1640, MCDB-131, or M199 supplemented with B-27 (all from Gibco) or serum albumin, by timed use of small-molecule GSK 3 inhibitor, CHIR 99021 (days 0 to 1), and Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway inhibitors (days 2 to 4) (Tocris). Twenty-four hours before cryopreservation, RUES2 hESC-CMs were heat shocked to enhance their survival after harvest, cryopreservation, thaw, and transplantation. Cardiomyocyte aggregates were dissociated by treatment with Liberase TH (Fisher) and TrypLE (Gibco) and were cryopreserved in CryoStor CS10 (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 (STEMCELL Technologies) using a controlled-rate liquid nitrogen freezer. Approximately 3 h before transplantation, cryopreserved hESC-CMs were removed from cryogenic storage (−150°C to −196°C) and thawed in a 37°C water bath (2 min ± 30 s). RPMI-1640 supplemented with B-27 and ≥200 Kunitz units/mL DNase I (Millipore) was added to the cell suspension to dilute the cryopreservation media. Subsequent wash steps were done using RPMI-1640 basal medium in progressively smaller volumes to concentrate the cell suspension. For the last centrifugation step, the cell pellet was resuspended in a sufficient volume of RPMI-1640 to achieve a target cell density for injection of ∼3 × 109 cells/mL in 1.6 mL. The final volume of the cell suspension was determined by the results of a count sampled before the final centrifugation step. Cell counts were performed as described previously to achieve a final total dose of 500 × 106 live cells per transplant.",
        "The objective of this study was to identify a pharmacological regimen to attenuate arrhythmias following cardiac remuscularization therapy. This study was designed in two phases: the first to observe the natural history of EA in the minipig model and screen various antiarrhythmic agents for possible efficacy, and the second to rigorously test for efficacy of selected candidates (Figure 1). All protocols were approved and conducted in accordance with the University of Washington (UW) Office of Animal Welfare and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All subjects were 30–40 kg castrated male Yucatan minipigs between 6 and 13 months of age (Premier BioSource). In phase 1, nine subjects underwent cardiac remuscularization therapy with 500 × 106 hESC-CMs delivered by direct surgical trans-epicardial injections, or later by percutaneous trans-endocardial injections (Table 1). The first four subjects (one non-infarcted and three infarcted) were followed to learn the natural history of EA and establish clinical endpoints and parameters for the phase 2 trial. The subsequent five subjects underwent systematic dosing with antiarrhythmic agents with continuous electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring to determine effect on rhythm and rate (Table S1, supplemental information). In brief, subjects were administered serial trials of antiarrhythmics and observed for acute response by continuous ECG monitoring. All agents were tested in at least two subjects. Details are provided in the supplemental information.",
        "Among the nine subjects in phase 1, we observed high mortality, with six out of nine experiencing VF or tachycardia-induced heart failure requiring euthanasia. VF typically occurred within the first week of transplantation and following frequent episodes of unstable EA >350 bpm, and tachycardia-induced heart failure requiring euthanasia was characterized by chronically elevated heart rates >150 bpm for 1–2 weeks.",
        "In phase 2, we conducted a two-drug antiarrhythmic study with amiodarone and ivabradine, enrolling an additional 17 subjects (9 treated, 8 untreated) that underwent MI and percutaneous transplantation with hESC-CMs at 2 weeks post-MI. Two additional subjects underwent MI with sham vehicle injection to serve as sham transplant controls (Figures 1 and S1). The primary endpoint was prespecified as combined cardiac death (either spontaneous death from arrhythmia or heart failure, or clinically directed euthanasia necessitated by sustained tachycardia >350 bpm or signs of heart failure). Prespecified secondary endpoints were suppression of tachycardia, percent time in arrhythmia (arrhythmia burden) and resolution of arrhythmia, termed “electrical maturation” and defined as arrhythmia burden <25% for 48 consecutive hours. Antiarrhythmic therapy was discontinued after electrical maturation or at post-transplantation day 30, whichever was earlier. To prevent tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, we titrated ivabradine treatment to maintain target heart rate <150 bpm. Based on early experience that tachycardia >350 bpm often degenerated to VF, subjects were euthanized humanely if heart rates >350 bpm were reached. Continuous telemetric ECG was monitored for 8 weeks in total (2 weeks post-MI and 6 weeks post-transplantation). Of note, subjects 1 and 2 (untreated) and 3 and 4 (treated) received H7 hESC-CMs and subjects 1–3 were transplanted surgically before adopting percutaneous delivery. Subject 5 exhibited early electrical maturation on day 12 and was euthanized on day 31 before extending the study duration to 6 weeks post-transplantation for extended treatment washout and monitoring for all subjects.",
        "MI was induced percutaneously 2 weeks before cell transplantation (supplemental information). Cell transplantation for our three initial subjects (1–3) was performed by direct trans-epicardial injection into the peri-infarction region as previously described for NHPs with minor modification (Liu et al., 2018) and described in the supplemental information. All subsequent subjects (4–19) received cell transplantation via percutaneous trans-endocardial injection using the NOGA-MyoStar platform (BioSense Webster). In brief, trans-epicardial injection via partial median sternotomy was performed to expose the infarcted anterior left ventricle. Purse-string sutures were preplaced at five discrete locations subtended by the LAD, targeting the central ischemic region (2/5) and lateral border zones identified by gross inspection and adjudicated by consensus of the surgical team. After cinching the purse-string tightly around the needle, three injections of 100 μL each were performed by partial withdrawal and lateral repositioning, for a total of 15 injections to deliver a total dose of 500 × 106 hESC-CMs. Percutaneous trans-endocardial injection using the NOGA-MyoStar platform (BioSense Webster) was performed by first mapping the infarct region in the left ventricle, and then deliver 16 discrete endocardial injections of 100 μL each for a total dose of 500 × 106 hESC-CMs. Injections were only performed with excellent location and loop stability, ST-segment elevation, and the presence of premature ventricular contraction with needle insertion in an appropriate location by electroanatomical map and unipolar voltage. Two-thirds of injections were placed into the peri-infarct border zone defined by a unipolar voltage of 5–7.5 mV, and the remaining one-third into the central ischemic region, defined as unipolar voltage of <5 mV. Two subjects (9 and 10) were infarcted as per protocol but received sham injections of RPMI-1640 vehicle without cells to serve as sham transplant controls.",
        "All three cohorts received a three-drug immunosuppression regimen to prevent xenograft rejection, as described previously with modification (Liu et al., 2018). For our initial regimen (subjects 1–6), 5 days before cell transplantation, oral cyclosporine A was started to maintain a serum trough level of >400 ng/mL (approximately 250–1,000 mg twice daily) for the duration of the study. Two days before transplantation, oral methylprednisolone was started at 3 mg/kg for 2 weeks and then titrated down to 1.5 mg/kg for the remainder of the study. On the day of transplantation, Abatacept (CTLA4-Ig, Bristol-Myers Squibb), 12.5 mg/kg, was administered intravenously and dosed every 2 weeks thereafter. Due to complications related to immunosuppression (principally porcine cytomegalovirus and Pneumocystis pneumonia), the cyclosporine A trough level was decreased to >300 ng/mL and the methylprednisolone reduced to 1.0 mg/kg for subjects 7–19 without histologic evidence of rejection. Prophylactic oral cephalexin was administered for all subjects to prevent infection of the indwelling central venous catheter. Prophylactic sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was added after subject 3 developed Pneumocystis pneumonia. Prophylactic valganciclovir and probiotics were added after activation of endogenous porcine cytomegalovirus (CMV) was found in subject 6. Further complications related to CMV were not observed in subsequent subjects with prophylaxis.",
        "The treated cohort was loaded with oral amiodarone 1,000–1,200 mg orally twice daily starting 7 days before cell transplantation followed by a maintenance dose of 400–1,000 mg orally twice daily to maintain a steady-state plasma level of 1.5–4.0 μg/mL (Figure S2). Ivabradine was started at 2.5 mg orally twice daily when sustained tachycardia reached ≥150 bpm and titrated every 3 days up to 15 mg twice daily for a goal heart rate of <125 bpm. All but one subject (1) required adjunctive ivabradine for additional heart rate control. Antiarrhythmics were discontinued after electrical maturation was achieved or at post-transplantation day 30, whichever was earlier, to allow for treatment washout and assess for recrudescence of arrhythmia. All subjects tolerated the antiarrhythmic regimen without complication. Untreated and sham transplant control subjects did not receive antiarrhythmic agents following the MI procedure, but otherwise received all immunosuppression and standard care.",
        "Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to monitor steady-state serum levels of amiodarone in the minipig model and guide oral dosing to ensure efficacy and avoid dose-related toxicity. A target serum level of 1.5–4.0 μg/mL was extrapolated from previous human pharmacokinetic studies (Mostow et al., 1984; Staubli et al., 1983). Elimination kinetics after discontinuation of oral amiodarone therapy were also studied by obtaining weekly trough concentrations in six subjects (6, 7, 8, 13, 14, and 16) (Figure S2).",
        "Telemetric ECG was continuously monitored in real time from the time of MI to detect the primary endpoint of cardiac death or unstable EA. Automated quantification of heart rate and arrhythmia burden was performed offline by a board-certified cardiologist using the ecgAUTO 3.3.5.10 software package (EMKA Technologies). Arrhythmia was defined as an ectopic beat (e.g., premature ventricular contraction) or rhythm (e.g., idioventricular rhythm, VT). EA was typically observed as sustained and non-sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia of varying rates and morphologies, but also included slow and narrow complex ectopic rhythms (Figure 2). Heart rate and arrhythmia burden were quantified continuously for phase 1 subjects. For phase 2 subjects, two continuous minutes every 5 min (40% of total rhythm was counted) was analyzed and presented as daily averages.",
        "Statistical analyses and graphing were performed using Prism 8.4.2 software (GraphPad) and Stata 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney test with significance threshold of p < 0.05. The sample size to demonstrate a difference in mortality rate of 67% (untreated group) versus 0% (treatment group), with alpha = 0.05 and 90% power, was estimated to be 8 per cohort. Kaplan-Meier plots show survival curves for the primary endpoint of cardiac death, unstable EA or heart failure, and for all-cause mortality. Cox proportional regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio between the two treatment groups for the primary outcome and for mortality. Significance is based on the likelihood ratio test and confidence intervals on hazard ratio were computed by inverting the likelihood test, based on varying the offset term in the stcox procedure in Stata.",
        "Histological studies were carried out as detailed previously with modification (Chong et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2018). In brief, paraformaldehyde-fixed hearts were dissected to remove the atria and right ventricle before short-axis cross-sections were cut at 2.5 mm intervals. The weights of the whole heart, left ventricle, and each slice were obtained before further partition into tissue cassettes. The tissue then was processed, embedded in paraffin, and 4 μm sections were cut for staining. For morphometry, infarct regions were identified by Picrosirius red staining; human graft was identified by anti-human cardiac troponin T (Invitrogen, MA5-12960), stained using avidin-biotin reaction (ABC Kit, VectorLabs), followed by chromogenic detection via diaminobenzidine (Sigmafast, Sigma Life Science) (Figure S3). The slides were digitized using a whole slide scanner (Nanozoomer, Hamamatsu), and the images were viewed and exported with NDP.view 2.6.13 (Hamamatsu). Areas of infarct and graft were analyzed using a custom-written algorithm in the ImageJ open source software platform (Schindelin et al., 2015). In brief, after extracting images in TIFF format (Deroulers et al., 2013), the image foreground was segmented by a threshold derived from the distribution in brightness of its pixels, resulting in a binary mask that delineates the imaged tissue section. Subsequent color de-convolution by thresholding hue, brightness, and saturation allowed segmentation of regions stained by Picrosirius red stain or areas immunolabeled for human cardiac troponin T. To separate scar from diffuse fibrosis, a cutoff for particle size was applied. Infarct size and graft size were calculated (percent area × block weight), summed for the entire ventricle, and expressed as a percentage of left ventricular mass or infarct mass, respectively. Please see the supplemental information for Purkinje fiber staining.",

        "The m6A RNA modification is a posttranscriptional epigenetic alteration that occurs in both coding and non-coding RNAs, influenced by various factors including methyltransferases, demethylases, and m6A-specific binding proteins (Barnett et al. 2023). These components collectively facilitate RNA processing, cleavage, translation, and degradation of target RNAs (Bassiouni et al. 2023). Methylation is achieved by the addition of a methyl group to the N⁶ position of adenosine, mediated by methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) in a complex with METTL14 and Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) via S-adenosyl methionine (Bhattacharyya et al. 2022). METTL3 serves as the catalytic core, while METTL14 stabilizes substrate RNA binding, and WTAP ensures the nuclear localization and structural integrity of the complex (Bhullar and Dhalla 2022). This tripartite assembly is essential for precise m⁶A deposition on target RNAs.",
        "Under normal physiological conditions, METTL3 ensures cardiomyocyte (CM, heart muscle cell) homeostasis by modulating RNA stability and translation. For instance, METTL3-mediated m⁶A modifications on ribosomal RNAs enhance ribosome biogenesis, supporting protein synthesis necessary for contractile function (Cheng et al. 2022; Cheng et al. 2023; Christidi et al. 2018). Additionally, METTL3 regulates baseline autophagy by stabilizing transcripts like transcription factor EB (TFEB), ensuring lysosomal efficiency and mitochondrial quality control (Deo 2015). These roles underscore METTL3’s dual function as both a modulator of stress responses and a guardian of CM integrity. Notably, elevated expression levels of METTL3 have been frequently observed in patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI, heart attack), myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiac fibrosis (Dorn et al. 2019). Moreover, targeting METTL3 holds potential for therapeutic intervention in these heart conditions. Despite the extensive research on METTL3's role in these diseases, there remains a scarcity of comprehensive reviews elucidating their interconnections and assessing the significance of METTL3.",
        "Thus, this review intends to bridge this gap in the literature by summarizing and critically analyzing all studies that report on the involvement of METTL3 in cardiac diseases. Additionally, we will evaluate the feasibility of METTL3 as a clinical target for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cardiology. In summary, this review aims to enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying METTL3-mediated m6A regulation in cardiac disease.",
        "CMs account for around 75% of the heart volume and are the dominant cells responsible for generating contractile forces and controlling the rhythmic beating of the heart (Dragasis et al. 2022). Injuries that affect the structure and function of CMs can cause massive loss of functional CMs, eventually leading to many CM-related disorders (termed cardiac diseases) (Fan et al. 2025). The dysregulation of METTL3 and its-mediated m6A modification on RNAs contributes to CM dysfunction and subsequently results in cardiac diseases, including AMI, myocardial I/R injury, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiac fibrosis (Fang et al. 2022). Furthermore, targeting METTL3 is therapeutic for myocardial regeneration.",
        "The coronary arteries supply oxygen and nutrients to the heart to sustain its function throughout life. However, changes in the artery wall narrow the vessel lumen and reduce blood flow, while plaque rupture results in complete thrombotic occlusion that in turn induces AMI (Flamand et al. 2023). AMI can lead to heart failure due to a marked loss of functional CMs.",
        "Hypoxia and ischemia are risk factors for CM dysfunction-induced AMI, which is involved in the massive loss of CMs due to hypoxia, as well as the recruitment and activation of myofibroblasts (Frangogiannis 2019). m6A changes dynamically after AMI. Wang et al. (Gao et al. 2020) found that m⁶A regulators are implicated in AMI and may carry prognostic significance. They identified insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1), Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), RNA binding motif protein 15, METTL3, YTH domain-containing protein 2, Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 as key regulators associated with the condition. Importantly, patients with high expression levels of METTL3 have an increased level of activated T cells, suggesting a potential immunomodulatory role of METTL3 in AMI (Gao et al. 2020). Mechanistically, METTL3-mediated m⁶A methylation may stabilize pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs [e.g., Interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)] in T cells, enhancing their translation and amplifying inflammatory responses within ischemic myocardium (Gao et al. 2020). This exacerbated T cell activation could aggravate myocardial injury by promoting cytotoxic effector functions and impairing regulatory T cell (Treg)-mediated immunosuppression. Furthermore, METTL3-dependent m⁶A modifications on programmed cell death protein 1 mRNA might reduce its stability, dampening inhibitory checkpoint signaling and perpetuating T cell hyperactivity (Gao et al. 2020). Collectively, these mechanisms position METTL3 as a critical regulator of adaptive immunity in AMI, linking RNA epitranscriptomics to inflammatory cardiomyocyte damage. Overall, m6A regulators prove to be useful in the development of therapy approaches for AMI (Gao et al. 2020). Bioinformatics analysis of m6A-related genes in patients with AMI indicates that METTL3 could be a novel target for AMI diagnosis (Giacca 2020). Besides, Ye et al. (Gong et al. 2021) demonstrated that in rat H9 C2 CMs undergoing hypoxic stress, METTL3 expression is extensively upregulated by the nuclear cap-binding subunit 3 (NCBP3). METTL3 regulates CM adaptation to hypoxic stress by mediating m⁶A modification of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 A2 (eIF4 A2) mRNA, thereby enhancing translational efficiency and contributing to AMI pathology (Gong et al. 2021). Therefore, NCBP3 is a novel protein responsive to hypoxic stimulation that acts as a scaffold for coordinating METTL3 and eIF4 A2 to enhance mRNA translation ability in CMs. However, Su et al. (Gong et al. 2023) observed reduced METTL3 levels in adult mouse hearts, differentiated embryonic stem cells, and aged hearts subjected to hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R) injury. Mechanistically, METTL3 modulates H/R-induced stress responses by regulating Bax (a pro-apoptotic gene) (Hayat 2023) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (Gong et al. 2023), a tumor suppressor implicated in cardiomyocyte death. Furthermore, lncRNA small nucleolus RNA host gene 8 (lncRNA-SNHG8), a member of the lncRNA family, is significantly up-regulated in AMI and is a potential biomarker that may be involved in ischemia-induced CM dysfunction (He et al. 2025). Tang et al. (He et al. 2025) reported that METTL3-mediated m6A modification on lncRNA-SNHG8 binds to polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1(PTBP1) to regulate aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2) expression, which in turn increases oxidative stress and promotes AMI occurrence. Knockdown of lncRNA-SNHG8, METTL3, or PTBP1 in CMs enhances CM viability, attenuates reactive oxygen species (ROS) release, and malondialchehyche level, alleviates oxidative stress, protecting myocardium from injury induced by hypoxia–reoxygenation (cellular) or ischemia–reperfusion (tissue/organ) (He et al. 2025). These data may imply that manipulating the effects of METTL3-mediated RNA m6A modification is beneficial for AMI recovery (Fig. 1A, Table 1).Fig. 1Mechanisms of METTL3’s function in cardiac diseases. The elevated expression of METTL3 promotes cardiomyocyte loss through the modulation of m6A methylation on diverse target RNAs in different cardiac disorders, which in turn triggers the releases of reactive oxygen species, inflammatory responses, and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to myocardial infarction, myocardial I/R injury, cardiac fibrosis, and cardiac hypertrophy.

        "Mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction occurs in the early time of AMI, which severely impairs CM survival (Frangogiannis 2019). Intercellular communication mediated by extracellular vehicles (EVs) following AMI is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, CM loss, and subsequent progression of heart failure (Hollenberg and Singer 2021). EVs containing miRNAs, whose levels markedly vary during pathological processes, exert functions by regulating gene expression at the posttranscriptional level (Huang et al. 2023). EV-encapsulated miR-503 enriches during the early phase of AMI, which promotes CM death by directly binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1β and sirtuin 3, a mitochondrial deacetylase, thereby triggering mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction and CM death (Jiang et al. 2021). Sun et al. (Jiang et al. 2021) reported that endothelial cells (ECs) are the primary source of miR-503 in EVs after AMI. Hypoxia induces rapid H3 K4 methylation on the METTL3 promoter, resulting in METTL3 overexpression, which evokes m6A-dependent miR-503 biogenesis in ECs (Jiang et al. 2021). In summary, this study highlights the mechanism disturbing CM mitochondrial homeostasis and CM loss during AMI that is linked greatly to METTL3-mediated m6A modification, wherein EVs aggravate myocardial injury during the AMI onset via EC-secreted miR-503 shuttling (Fig. 1A, Table 1).",
        "Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation (VF), are the leading causes of mortality after AMI. Sympathetic hyperactivity causes VAs in the early stage of AMI by overwhelming local norepinephrine release, which contributes to the high mortality by lowering VF thresholds in AMI and is highly arrhythmogenic in the per-infarct area (Kruszewska et al. 2022). Microglia-mediated inflammation in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is involved in the sympathetic hyperactivity of AMI (Li et al. 2018). Qi et al. (Li et al. 2021) found that METTL3-mediated m6A modification on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mRNA is markedly increased in the PVN at 3 days of AMI, and METTL3 is primarily located in microglia. Mechanically, the elevated TLR4 expression, combined with the activated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, leads to the overwhelming production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and TNF-α in the PVN, thus inducing sympathetic hyperactivity and increasing the VA incidence after AMI (Li et al. 2021). Interestingly, targeting METTL3 reduces the inflammatory response, sympathetic hyperactivity, and incidence of VAs after AMI (Li et al. 2021). These data collectively suggest that elevated level of METTL3 in microglia triggers AMI by activating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Additionally, TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is regarded as a protein that integrates with TNF receptors in human and rodent cells, which is rapidly activated and translocated to the mitochondria, augmenting the production of mitochondrial ROS in macrophages (Li et al. 2022a). Therefore, METTL3 stabilizes TLR4 mRNA via m⁶A methylation, enabling sustained NF-κB signaling and IL-1β/TNF-α production in microglia. This neuroinflammatory cascade disrupts autonomic balance, lowering the ventricular fibrillation threshold and increasing arrhythmia susceptibility (Li et al. 2021; Li et al. 2022a). Yang et al. (Li et al. 2022b) found that METTL3 is predominantly localized in the microglia and is significantly increased within the PVN at 3 days of AMI. Downregulation of METTL3 prevents TRAF6 translocation to the mitochondria in the microglia and subsequently activates the TRAF6/ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in toll pathways) pathway, resulting in decreased mitochondrial ROS production and improved cardiac function (Li et al. 2022b). This study demonstrates that METTL3-mediated m6A modification promotes sympathetic hyperactivity through the TRAF6/ECSIT pathway and mitochondrial oxidative stress in the PVN, thereby leading to VAs after AMI (Fig. 1A, Table 1).",
        "Sympathetic neural remodeling caused by inflammation after AMI is closely associated with the occurrence of VAs (Li et al. 2024a). Macrophages are the central link between inflammation and sympathetic remodeling after AMI. Qi et al. (Li et al. 2024a) found that METTL3 is predominantly expressed in macrophages following AMI. Expression of METTL3, TRAF6, NADPH Oxidase 2, and NF-κB was elevated at day 3 and remained high at day 7 post-infarction. Mechanistically, METTL3 binds to the 3’-untranslated regions (3’-UTR) of TRAF6 mRNA, promoting its m⁶A methylation. Silencing METTL3 reduced TRAF6 m⁶A levels, inhibited NF-κB activation and ROS production, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-α and IL-1β), and suppressed nerve growth factor expression (Li et al. 2024a). METTL3 knockdown reduces sympathetic remodeling activity and improves cardiac function after AMI (Li et al. 2024a). In summary, METTL3 is critical in mediating inflammatory responses of macrophages, downregulation of METTL3 attenuates the excessive inflammation and sympathetic neural remodeling induced by AMI, further reducing the incidence of VAs and improving cardiac function by targeting the TRAF6/NF-κB pathway (Fig. 1A, Table 1).",
        "Collectively, these findings suggest that METTL3, either acting as a trigger for the occurrence of AMI or a target that confers benefits in maintaining the biological function of CMs and facilitating AMI recovery, is a promising biomarker for AMI diagnosis and target for therapy.",
        "Following AMI, persistent ischemia causes local myocardial necrosis (Li et al. 2024b). The most effective therapeutic intervention is to restore the blood flow in the ischemic area in the early stage of AMI and reduce the myocardial ischemic injury, and infarct size (Liang et al. 2022). However, myocardial reperfusion after AMI activates oxidative stress response that causes massive loss of functional CMs, ultimately leading to myocardial I/R injury (Liu et al. 2014).",
        "Microplastics (MPs) exposure induces oxidative stress and inflammation, which stimulate organ damage by regulating the expression of numerous key genes (Liu et al. 2023). Total levels of m6A and METTL3 are increased in the myocardium after exposure to MPs (Lu et al. 2021). RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq in MP-exposed myocardial tissue screen differentially expressed ncRNAs and their related m6A modification profiles (Lu et al. 2021). GO and KEGG enrichment analyses show that these altered lncRNAs and circRNAs are closely associated with endocytosis, cellular senescence, and cell cycle signaling pathways, which may cause cardiotoxicity (Lu et al. 2021). Furthermore, MeRIP-seq data show different distributions and abundances of m6A modifications on lncRNAs and circRNAs. Both m6A modifications upregulate the expression of lncG3bp2 and circ-Arfgef2 after exposure to MPs (Lu et al. 2021). This suggests that MP-induced METTL3 upregulation contributes to oxidative stress response by mediating m6A modifications on ncRNAs, which further induces CM loss. Interestingly, another study demonstrated that Cyclophosphamide increases the field and action potential durations in CMs by upregulating METTL3, which subsequently reduces junctophilin 2 (JPH2) expression to induce cardiotoxicity and CM death (Ozadam et al. 2023). The pattern of CM death includes apoptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy, and pyroptosis (Prata et al. 2020) (Fig. 1B, Table 1).",
        "According to a combined analysis of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq for MI tissues, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Hadh), potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily N member 1 (Kcnn1), and ten-eleven translocation 1(Tet1) are identified as hub mRNAs that are associated with apoptosis/angiogenesis (Qi et al. 2022a). Inhibition of METTL3 in CMs downregulates the m6A methylation level of total RNA and upregulates the expression of these hub mRNAs. Importantly, under the condition of simulated hypoxia, Kcnn1 and Tet1 impact the process of angiogenesis, whereas Hadh, Tet1, and Kcnn1 function in the programmed cell death of apoptosis (Qi et al. 2022a). Furthermore, Gong et al. (Qi et al. 2022b) discovered a significantly upregulated level of METTL3 in CMs following acute cardiac injury. METTL3 promotes neonatal CM death by modulating the m6A modification of the pri-miR-143 and facilitating the maturation of pri-miR-143 into miR-143-3p, which selectively targets yes-associated protein (YAP) and catenin delta 1(CTNND1). These studies provide a theoretical basis for taking METTL3-mediated RNA m6A modification as the mechanism of CM death in myocardial I/R injury after AMI (Fig. 1B, Table 1).",
        "Ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death featuring lipid peroxidation overload and iron accumulation, has been found in CMs (Qiu et al. 2023). METTL3 regulates CM functions during acute injury. Qiu et al. (Rabolli et al. 2024) found that METTL3/IGF2BP2-mediated m6A modification on kruppel-like factor 6 (Klf6) mRNA enhances Klf6 mRNA stability and expression in the heart tissues from I/R mice, which directly binds to the Acsl4 promoter and positively regulates its expression, leading to CM ferroptosis. Klf6 knockdown inhibits ferroptosis and improves I/R-induced myocardial injury (Rabolli et al. 2024). Klf6 m6A modification regulated by METTL3 and IGF2BP2 aggravates myocardial I/R damage through activating acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (Acsl4)-mediated ferroptosis, thereby providing one potential target for the treatment of myocardial I/R (Rabolli et al. 2024) (Fig. 1B, Table 1).",
        "Autophagy has been regarded as an important strategy to protect CMs from I/R injury (Rao et al. 2021). Song et al. (Deo 2015) reported an upregulation of METTL3-mediated m6A modification in H/R-treated CMs and I/R-treated mouse hearts, which operates by diminishing autophagic flux while promoting apoptosis in H/R-treated CMs. In this case, METTL3, in conjunction with the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (HNRNPD), modifies TFEB (a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy genes) within its 3'-UTR, ultimately leading to decreased TFEB expression (Deo 2015). This study demonstrates that the METTL3/HNRNPD-TFEB axis mediates the negative regulation of CM autophagy after H/R and I/R, providing novel insights into the mechanism understanding of ischemic heart disease (Fig. 1B, Table 1).",
        "CM pyroptosis contributes to CM loss and myocardial I/R injury, which is a complicated pathophysiological process (Rao et al. 2022). METTL3 expression is elevated in myocardial I/R rats and oxygen glucose deprivation/R CMs, which participate in the regulation of CM pyroptosis (Ritterhoff and Tian 2023). Wang et al. (Ritterhoff and Tian 2023) reported that METTL3 increases the total m6A level in myocardial I/R rats and injured CMs, promotes microprocessor complex subunit (DGCR8) binding to pri-miR-143-3p, and enhances miR-143-3p expression, which in turn suppresses protein kinase c epsilon (PRKCE) transcription. Therefore, METTL3 promotes DGCR8 binding to pri-miR-143-3p through m6A modification, enhancing miR-143-3p expression to inhibit PRKCE transcription and further aggravating CM pyroptosis and myocardial I/R injury. Additionally, pyroptosis not only causes CM death but also participates in the cascade of inflammatory response in ischemic myocardial tissues, affecting the severity and prognosis of myocardial I/R injury (Schäfer et al. 2022). Sepsis is an inflammation syndrome after infection by various pathogenic microorganisms (Scheffer et al. 2022). Cardiac insufficiency caused by sepsis is commonly referred to as septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) and is mainly attributed to LPS-induced systemic inflammation (Sergeeva et al. 2020). Gong et al. (Shi et al. 2014) demonstrated that METTL3 is abnormally upregulated both in samples of patients with SCM and in LPS-treated H9 C2 CMs. In vitro and in vivo, the deficiency of METTL3 improves cardiac function, cardiac tissue damage, myocardial cell apoptosis, and ROS levels in LPS-treated H9 C2 CMs and LPS-induced sepsis rats, respectively (Shi et al. 2014). RNA-seq analysis suggests that the half-life of myosin heavy chain 3 (Myh3) mRNA is significantly reduced after METTL3 deletion and that Myh3 carries several potential m6A modification sites (Shi et al. 2014). In conclusion, METTL3 promotes LPS-induced myocardial damage and cardiac dysfunction by increasing Myh3 mRNA stability. This study reveals a key role of METTL3-mediated m6A methylation in SCM, which offers a potential mechanism for the therapy of SCM (Fig. 1B, Table 1).",
        "To sum up, high levels of METTL3 contribute to the occurrence and progression of myocardial I/R injury by inducing oxidative stress response in CMs, leading to CM apoptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy, and pyroptosis. Therefore, targeting METTL3 is promising for rescuing CM death.",
        "Cardiac fibrosis and CM apoptosis are reparative processes after AMI, which results in cardiac remodeling and heart failure at last (Song et al. 2019). Cardiac fibrosis is a common pathological change in multiple cardiac diseases, which is characterized by aberrant activation of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition (Song et al. 2019).",
        "The activated CF differentiate into myofibroblasts that migrate and concentrate in injured areas of the myocardium and can expand to the border zones in most cardiac pathologic conditions, producing collagens and other ECM as well (Stüdemann et al. 2022). The upregulated level of METTL3 binding lncRNA (MetBil) augments collagen deposition and CF proliferation following AMI (Su et al. 2020). Importantly, the m6A-modified fibrosis-regulated genes mediated by METTL3 are profoundly involved in the regulation of MetBil in cardiac fibrosis following AMI. Zhuang et al. (Su et al. 2020) showed that MetBil and METTL3 are co-localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of CFs. Interestingly, METTL3 binding MetBil directly interacts with METTL3 and promotes its ubiquitin-dependent degradation via the proteasome pathway (Su et al. 2020). Mechanistically, MetBil serves as a scaffold to recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, which catalyzes K48-linked polyubiquitination of METTL3 at lysine residues 313 and 315, marking it for proteasomal degradation (Su et al. 2020). This reduction in METTL3 protein levels diminishes m⁶A methylation on fibrosis-associated transcripts, including collagen genes (COL1 A1, COL3 A1) and TGF-β1 signaling components (SMAD2, SMAD4) (Su et al. 2020). METTL3-mediated m⁶A modifications enhance the stability and translation efficiency of these transcripts by recruiting YTH domain family (YTHDF) 1/3 readers, thereby driving collagen deposition and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (Su et al. 2020). Conversely, MetBil knockdown stabilizes METTL3, amplifying m⁶A-dependent fibrotic gene expression and exacerbating cardiac fibrosis. In line with this study, Li et al. (Su et al. 2021) reported that the expression level of METTL3 is increased in cardiac fibrotic tissue of AMI mice and CFs treated with TGF-β1, which promotes proliferation and fibroblast transition to myofibroblast and collagens accumulation. Further bioinformatics analyses reveal that METTL3 modulates the expression and m6A levels of collagen-related genes (Su et al. 2021). These findings suggest that METTL3-mediated m6A modification triggers the onset and progression of cardiac fibrosis, thereby providing a novel molecular mechanism and therapeutic target for managing fibrosis and associated cardiac disorders (Fig. 1C, Table 1).",
        "Excessive ECM deposition contributes to ventricular stiffness and diastolic and systolic dysfunction, which represents a potential risk factor for heart failure (Su et al. 2024). Tenascin-C (TNC) is a large multimodular glycoprotein of the ECM, which serves as a key regulator of CM proliferation and apoptosis and contributes to cardiac fibrosis and CM apoptosis after AMI (Sun et al. 2022). Cheng et al. (Tang et al. 2022) demonstrated that overexpression of METTL3 leads to enhanced m6A levels of TNC mRNA and promotes TNC mRNA stability and translation, aggravating cardiac dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis 4 weeks after AMI. In conclusion, METTL3 induces cardiac fibrosis and CM apoptosis by increasing the m6A levels of TNC mRNA and may be a promising target for the therapy of cardiac fibrosis after AMI (Fig. 1C, Table 1).",
        "Collectively, high levels of METTL3 are closely related to the occurrence and progression of cardiac fibrosis, which induces CM apoptosis by over-activating CFs and excessive-depositing ECM, suggesting its potential for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac fibrosis.",
        "Cardiac enlargement due to myocardial injury, hypertensive stress, or excessive neurohumoral activation is classified as pathological hypertrophy, which is associated with poor cardiac adaptive remodeling and cardiac dysfunction (Tang et al. 2023).",
        "Comprehensive analysis of RNA m6A methylation in pressure overload‑induced cardiac hypertrophy found that m6A methylation levels are higher in transverse aortic constriction (TAC) mice hearts (Umei et al. 2023). MeRIP-seq revealed that 1179 m6A peaks are up-methylated and 733 m6A peaks are down-methylated. Biological analysis of these genes shows a strong relationship with heart function (Umei et al. 2023). Furthermore, the cardiac-specific deletion of METTL3 in mice causes eccentric CM remodeling during aging and stress-induced heart failure (Cheng et al. 2023). Cardiac-hypertrophy-associated PIWI-interacting RNAs (CHAPIR) are associated with pathological hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling. Gao et al. (Niel et al. 2022) demonstrated that CHAPIR-Piwi-like RNA-mediated gene silencing 4 (PIWIL4) complex directly interacts with METTL3 to impede m6A methylation of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 10 (PARP10) mRNA transcript, upregulating PARP10 expression (Niel et al. 2022). Consequently, this upregulation triggers mono-ADP-ribosylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β), inhibiting its kinase activity, causing nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 4 (NFATC4), and promoting pathological hypertrophy progression (Niel et al. 2022). Therefore, METTL3 is essential for normal CM hypertrophy and actively regulates cardiac hypertrophy during pathological processes. Besides, dysregulation of METTL3-mediated m6A methylation on RNAs also plays a crucial role in promoting the occurrence and development of myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling (Fig. 1D, Table 1).",
        "Angiotensin II (Ang-II) is a vasopressor usually elevated in hypertension, leading to the deterioration of the pressure (Wal et al. 2023). Besides, Ang-II acts directly on the myocardium to promote pathological cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac failure (Wal et al. 2023). Lu et al. (Wang et al. 2016) reported ubiquitin-specific protease 12 (USP12) exacerbates Ang-II-induced cardiac hypertrophy by upregulating METTL3 expression. USP12 binds to and stabilizes E1 A binding protein p300 (p300), activating the transcription of its downstream gene, METTL3. This suggests that USP12 promotes myocardial hypertrophy via p300 stabilization and increased METTL3 expression. USP12 is therefore a pro-hypertrophic deubiquitinating enzyme that exerts its function by promoting the p300/METTL3 axis. Zhang et al. (Wang et al. 2022a) reported that the expression of METTL3 and miR-221/222 and the level of m6A are significantly increased in response to Ang-II stimulation. The expression of miR-221/222 is regulated by METTL3 positively, and the level of pri-miR-221/222 that binds to DGCR8 or forms m6A methylation is promoted by METTL3 in neonatal rat CMs, which subsequently activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling by inhibiting dickkopf-related protein 2 (DKK2) to induce hypertrophy (Wang et al. 2022a). Knockdown of METTL3 or miR-221/222 abolishes the hypertrophy in neonatal rat CM and attenuates Ang-II-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mouse models (Wang et al. 2022a). These findings collectively suggest that METTL3 positively modulates the pri-miR221/222 maturation process in an m6A-dependent manner and subsequently activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling by inhibiting DKK2, thus promoting Ang-II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Suppression of cardiac METTL3 could be therapeutic for pathological myocardial hypertrophy (Fig. 1D, Table 1).",
        "In conclusion, the aberrant functions of METTL3-mediated RNA m6A modification disrupt the delicate balance of cardiac homeostasis and contribute to cardiac hypertrophy development. Consequently, we propose METTL3 as a promising diagnostic biomarker for identifying individuals with cardiac hypertrophy.",
        "Although myocardial regeneration is enhanced after AMI, it is unable to compensate for the massive sudden loss of CMs, and it cannot restore the contractile function of the injured heart (Wang et al. 2022b). Moreover, adult mammalian CM lose their mitotic ability shortly after birth, leading to cell cycle stagnation and low renewal rates (Wang et al. 2023a). Therefore, identifying novel molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways by which adult CM proliferate in tissues with reduced contractility yields promise for cardiac function restoration of AMI-induced heart failure.",
        "M6A-RIP-seq and RNA-seq suggest that METTL3 is necessary to maintain the proliferation capacity of neonatal CMs after birth (Qi et al. 2022b). Thus, targeting the regulation of METTL3 in CMs after AMI is an attractive strategy for myocardial regeneration. For example, METTL3 expression is upregulated in hypoxia-exposed neonatal rat CMs and AMI-induced rats, which promotes CM proliferation under pathological conditions (Wang et al. 2023b). Zhao et al. (Wang et al. 2023b) reported that silencing METTL3 promotes CM proliferation and inhibits CM apoptosis under hypoxic or AMI conditions, which functions by downregulating miR-17-3p expression in a RNA-binding protein DGCR8 dependent manner (Wang et al. 2023b). Overall, this study indicates that inhibiting METTL3 ameliorates AMI in rats through the METTL3/DGCR8- miR-17-3p axis (Wang et al. 2023b). Furthermore, Su et al. (xxxx) demonstrated that hypoxic preconditioning confers protection against hydrogen peroxide-induced injury in H9 C2 CMs by enhancing cell viability and anti-apoptotic capacity via upregulating METTL3-mediated m6A modification on lncRNA H19 (Table 2).\nTable 2Methods and targets for cardiac tissue regeneration by modulating METTL3METTL3MethodsTargetsCardiac diseasesReferencesMETTL3 silencingmiR-17-3pAcute myocardial infarction Wang et al. 2023b)Hypoxic-preconditioningMETTL3 xxxx)ABRO1METTL3Myocardial-ischemia/reperfusion injury West et al. 2011)METTL3knockdownFgf16 Wu et al. 2020)METTL3 inhibitorDrp1Cardiac fibrosis Xu et al. xxxx)Maslinic AcidMETTL3Cardiac hypertrophy Yang et al. 2018)Intermittent fastingMETTL3 Yang et al. 2023a)Inhibition of METTL3 through specific therapeutic approaches effectively mitigates cardiomyocyte apoptosis by targeting various RNA species, ultimately alleviating cardiac pathologies and facilitating myocardial regenerationAbraxas brother 1 (ABRO1).

        "Abraxas brother 1 (ABRO1) predominantly expresses in the heart, and its level is upregulated upon myocardial I/R injury (West et al. 2011). Wang et al. (West et al. 2011) found that deletion of ABRO1 increases CM proliferation and cardiac regeneration by targeting METTL3-mediated m6A methylation on phosphoserine phosphatase (Psph) mRNA after myocardial injury. In the early postnatal period, METTL3-dependent m6A methylation promotes CM proliferation by hypomethylating Psph mRNA and upregulating Psph expression, which in turn dephosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), a positive regulator of the cell cycle, at Thr14/Tyr15 and increases its activity (West et al. 2011). Therefore, ABRO1 negatively regulates cell cycle progression by regulating the METTL3-Psph-CDK2 axis, improving myocardial injury and inducing myocardial regeneration. Additionally, Jiang et al. (Wu et al. 2020) found that the knockdown of METTL3 significantly increases CM proliferation and accelerates heart regeneration following heart injury in neonatal and adult mice, which upregulates fibroblast growth factor 16 (Fgf16) expression in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner. METTL3 overexpression or silencing of Fgf16 suppresses CM proliferation (Wu et al. 2020). These data demonstrate that METTL3 upregulates Fgf16 through an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent pathway, thereby controlling CM proliferation and heart regeneration. Targeting the METTL3/m6A/YTHDF2/Fgf16 pathway may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to promote the proliferation of CMs in myocardial regeneration (Table 2).",
        "A balanced mitochondrial fusion and fission is essential to maintain intracardiac homeostasis and reduce myocardial remodeling post-stress (xxxx). Huang et al. (Xu et al. xxxx) found that METTL3-METTL14 inhibition effectively decreases CM death by reducing mitochondrial fragmentation and inhibiting myofibrillar transformation. Double-layer programmed drug release microneedle (DPDMN) treatment of AMI in rat models shows improved cardiac function and decreased infarct size and fibrosis level, demonstrating its superior effectiveness (Xu et al. xxxx). The DPDMN delivers METTL3 inhibitor swiftly in the early phase to rescue dying CMs and slowly in the late phase to achieve long-term suppression of fibroblast over proliferation, collagen synthesis, and deposition (Xu et al. xxxx). METTL3 inhibition reduces the translation efficiency of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) mRNA by 5’-UTR m6A modification, thus decreasing the Drp1 protein level and mitochondrial fragment after hypoxic-ischemic injury (Xu et al. xxxx). This project investigates the efficacy of DPDMN-loaded METTL3 inhibitors in AMI treatment and the downstream signaling pathway proteins, providing an experimental foundation for the translation of the utility, safety, and versatility of METTL3 inhibitors for AMI into clinical applications (Table 2).",
        "Manipulating METTL3 expression in human CMs is paramount in preserving cardiac homeostasis and holds great therapeutic potential for managing cardiac hypertrophy. Maslinic Acid (MA) treatment rescues cardiac hypertrophy. Fang et al. (Yang et al. 2018) found that MA treatment significantly inhibits Ang-II-induced hypertrophy in neonatal rat CMs and the dosage does not influence the cell viability of rat CMs (Yang et al. 2018). Moreover, the anti-hypertrophy effect of MA is further verified in the TAC-induced hypertrophy mouse model. Further analysis shows that MA administration decreases the total levels of RNA m6A methylation and METTL3 in Ang-II-treated neonatal rat CMs and TAC-stressed hearts (Yang et al. 2018). Overexpression of METTL3 confirms that METTL3-mediated m6A methylation is essential for MA treatment of myocardial hypertrophy (Yang et al. 2018). These findings provide a platform for establishing METTL3 as a new target and strategy for cardiac hypertrophy treatment. Furthermore, Xu et al. (Yang et al. 2023a) explored the relationship between intermittent fasting and high-fat diet-induced diseases, demonstrating that intermittent fasting facilitates the functional and structural recovery of cardiac and serum lipid metabolic disorders. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that intermittent fasting suppresses METTL3 expression and enhances FTO expression in high-fat diet-induced obesity-related cardiomyopathy, which subsequently downregulates the expression of genes involved in fatty acid uptake (e.g., fatty acid binding protein 1 [i.e., FABP1], fatty acid transport protein 1 [i.e., FATP1], and a cluster of differentiation 36 [i.e., CD36]) and fatty acid synthesis (e.g., sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 [i.e., SREBF1], fas cell surface death receptor [i.e., FAS], and acetyl-CoA carboxylase [i.e., ACC]) while reducing the levels of genes related to fatty acid catabolism (e.g., adipose triglyceride lipase [i.e., ATGL], hormone-sensitive lipase [i.e., HSL], lipoprotein A lipase [i.e., LAL], and lipoprotein lipase [i.e., LPL]) (Yang et al. 2023a) (Table 2).",
        "In summary, these findings suggest that targeting METTL3 is effective for ameliorating heart diseases such as AMI, myocardial I/R injury, cardiac fibrosis, and cardiac hypertrophy, as well as promoting myocardial regeneration. Therefore, METTL3 could be a novel therapeutic target for these heart diseases in human beings.",
        "Recent research has focused on the role of METTL3-mediated RNA m6A modification in the development of cardiac diseases such as AMI, myocardial I/R injury, cardiac fibrosis, and hypertrophy, as well as myocardial regeneration. This review examines how METTL3 influences the pathogenesis and treatment of these conditions, clarifying their interconnections and assessing the clinical potential of METTL3.",
        "The findings suggest that METTL3 regulates CM activity and cardiac stability. When METTL3's RNA m6A modification functions abnormally, it leads to significant CM loss, disrupting cardiac stability and contributing to heart failure, stemming from AMI, myocardial I/R injury, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis. METTL3’s involvement in heart failure involves mechanisms such as CM apoptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, endocytosis, cellular senescence, cell cycle regulation, cardiotoxicity, and angiogenesis. For example, circulating METTL3 levels in plasma exosomes correlate with infarct size and left ventricular ejection fraction in AMI patients, suggesting its utility as a non-invasive prognostic biomarker (Yang et al. 2023b; Yankova et al. 2021). Consequently, METTL3 emerges as a risk factor for CM-related heart diseases and shows potential as a diagnostic biomarker. Additionally, nanoparticle-delivered METTL3 siRNA reduces cardiac fibrosis in murine models by silencing COL1 A1 and TNC expression, highlighting its therapeutic promise (Su et al. 2021; Tang et al. 2022). Therefore, regulating METTL3 expression in human CMs is crucial for maintaining cardiac stability and could be a viable therapeutic strategy for these conditions. In conclusion, METTL3 plays a dual role as a contributor to CM loss and as a therapeutic target to enhance CM function and aid in heart failure recovery, making it a promising biomarker for diagnosis and treatment.",
        "Recent advances in METTL3-targeted therapy include STM2457 (Ye et al. 2021), a small-molecule inhibitor that disrupts the METTL3-METTL14 interaction, reducing m⁶A deposition in CMs (Su et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2021a; Zhang et al. 2021b). In murine models of pressure overload, STM2457 attenuates cardiac hypertrophy by suppressing PARP10 and NFATC4 expression (Niel et al. 2022). However, systemic METTL3 inhibition risks off-target effects, such as impaired hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, underscoring the need for cardiac-specific delivery systems (Zhang et al. 2021a; Zhang et al. 2022). Challenges in METTL3-targeted therapy include: (1) Selectivity: Current inhibitors (e.g., STM2457) lack tissue specificity, potentially causing toxicity; (2) Dosage optimization: METTL3’s dual roles in homeostasis and disease necessitate precise dosing to avoid detrimental effects; (3) Biomarker gaps: No validated biomarkers exist to monitor METTL3 inhibition efficacy in patients. Therefore, research should prioritize the development of targeted METTL3 inhibitors or modulators to evaluate their therapeutic potential. These compounds can be tested in preclinical models for their effectiveness and safety. Investigating the effects of METTL3 modulation across diverse patient groups may help in identifying biomarkers for patient stratification and personalized treatment approaches. It's also important to consider the possible side effects of targeting METTL3 due to its involvement in various physiological functions, necessitating comprehensive toxicity assessments to avoid disrupting normal cellular activities. Collaboration among molecular biologists, pharmacologists, and clinicians will be crucial to translate these insights into clinical practice. In summary, while progress has been made in understanding METTL3's association with cardiac diseases, further exploration is needed. Addressing these knowledge gaps through interdisciplinary research could lead to innovative treatments that enhance patient outcomes.",
        "To unravel METTL3’s spatiotemporal dynamics, single-cell m⁶A sequencing could map cell-type-specific methylomes in developing, adult, and aged hearts (Zhang et al. 2023; Zhao et al. 2021). Coupled with spatial transcriptomics, this approach may resolve how METTL3 activity in cardiac fibroblasts versus CMs dictates fibrosis versus regeneration (Zhaolin et al. 2019). Furthermore, CRISPR-based screening of METTL3-ncRNA interactions in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs could identify therapeutic targets for congenital heart defects or age-related cardiomyopathy (Zhu et al. 2021). Lastly, leveraging machine learning to integrate multi-omics datasets (epitranscriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic) may predict METTL3-dependent regulatory networks, accelerating the translation of epitranscriptomic insights into precision cardiology (Zhuang et al. 2023).",
        "In conclusion, despite the observable link between METTL3 and cardiac diseases, there are still uncertainties regarding its role as a risk factor. Limited research on treatment failures involving METTL3 hinders a clear understanding of their relationship. While METTL3 is associated with various heart conditions, clinical validation of its potential uses is still insufficient. Additionally, although reducing METTL3 levels has shown promise for certain heart diseases, specific METTL3 inhibitors are not widely available. Future studies should address these gaps to clarify METTL3’s role in cardiac diseases. In summary, this review offers a detailed and updated exploration of the link between METTL3 and cardiac diseases, while also evaluating the potential clinical applications of targeting METTL3, thus filling existing literature gaps and providing a valuable reference for researchers in both basic and translational cardiovascular medicine.",

        "Heart failure is a common, incapacitating, and ultimately deadly malady. It represents an important contributor to the enormous economic costs and loss of lives worldwide each year [1]. Currently, sufficient progress has been made in treatments that alleviate symptoms and reasonably prolong the lifespan. However, these treatments are palliative in nature; they do not address the underlying problem of functional heart tissue loss. In this field of research over the last 15 years, the research laboratory Insuficiència Cardíaca i Regeneració Cardíaca (ICREC; translated from Catalan: Heart Failure and Cardiac Regeneration) has actively explored innovative biotherapies for cardiac repair [2].",
        "In the following, we describe our work from a critical perspective with the aim of providing value. In particular, we review our experience over the years in addressing cardiac healing after myocardial infarction (MI). We have used a variety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including those derived from cardiac adipose tissue (cATMSCs) and umbilical cord blood (UCBMSCs), and cardiac repair strategies, including cell therapy, electromechanical stem cell conditioning, tissue engineering (TE), and an adipose graft transposition procedure (AGTP) (Fig. 1 and Table 1).Fig. 1Cardiac cell therapy and tissue engineering experience at the ICREC laboratory. In the preclinical setting, UCBMSCs emerged as an alternative tissue source for cell therapy in treating diseases with vascular deficits. Conversely, cATMSCs showed baseline cardiomyogenic traits, which could be promoted with electromechanical stimulation; cATMSCs also possessed great reparative potential following implantation in vivo with cardiac engineered grafts or bioprostheses.

        "Cardiac cell therapy and tissue engineering experience at the ICREC laboratory. In the preclinical setting, UCBMSCs emerged as an alternative tissue source for cell therapy in treating diseases with vascular deficits. Conversely, cATMSCs showed baseline cardiomyogenic traits, which could be promoted with electromechanical stimulation; cATMSCs also possessed great reparative potential following implantation in vivo with cardiac engineered grafts or bioprostheses. Preliminary results were good when the AGTP was tested in humans; therefore, it might be not necessary to isolate and manipulate cells ex vivo when treating heart failure after myocardial infarction.

        "Over much of the last century, within the cardiac field, the mammalian adult heart was thought to be terminally differentiated. However, many studies have shown that myocardial regeneration occurred in rodents (1960s) [3], amphibians (1974) [4, 5], and zebrafish (2002) [6]. Subsequently, the human heart became a focus of intense research in regenerative medicine, due to its incapacity for self-repair. However, crucial studies have shown that resident cardiac stem cells maintained myocardial homeostasis throughout life [7–9], cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity continued to function at low levels [10–13], and cardiac chimerism/microchimerism phenomena occurred when extracardiac progenitor cells were moved to the myocardium, as in gender-mismatched heart transplantation procedures [14–19]; these observations have instigated a divergence from the old dogma. Hence, currently, we know that the human adult heart has reparative potential; unfortunately, however, this potential is reduced after MI, due to a massive loss of cardiac muscle. This condition causes an overload in the surviving myocardium and, potentially, leads to heart failure [20]. In present times, the only treatment for advanced heart failure that fully restores cardiac function is a heart transplantation, which is often restricted by the shortage of donors. These events have given rise to cell-based therapies.",
        "Multipotent MSCs appeared on stage as an attractive option for regenerating damaged tissues. Briefly, MSCs are recognized for their ability to differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages in vitro, their typical fibroblast-like morphology, their adherence to plastic, when maintained in standard culture conditions, and their nonhematopoietic cell surface pattern. In general, evidence has suggested that the contribution of MSCs to MI recovery lies in paracrine signaling, rather than a direct effect of MSCs. Paracrine signaling would be consistent with findings that a low number of retained or seeded cells could promote restorative effects, such as forming vessels to protect resident cardiomyocytes from apoptosis and mobilizing resident stem cells to potentiate vascularization and cardiomyogenesis. Thus, some authors have proposed the term “medicinal signaling cells” to reflect the fact that MSCs integrate into the sites of injury and secrete immunomodulatory and trophic factors, which have either pharmacological or tissue reparative activities [21].",
        "The trajectory of our laboratory has focused on the adipose tissue surrounding the heart as a source of MSCs [22]. In particular, we showed that these cATMSCs could be extracted from adipose depots located at the base of the heart and around the aortic root, from patients who underwent cardiothoracic surgery prior to cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. We hypothesized that cATMSCs, which showed a MSC-like pattern of cell surface antigen expression, might play a role in heart homeostasis, perhaps as a cell reservoir for renewing myocardial tissue. Indeed, despite residing in an adipose environment, cATMSCs had an inherent cardiac-like phenotype. At the protein level, they expressed β-MHC, SERCA2, sarcomeric α-actinin, GATA4, Cx43, and traces of Tbx5. In addition, coculturing cATMSCs with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes qualitatively increased the expression levels of these specific cardiac markers, and induced de-novo expression of troponin I, an important sarcomeric protein that was not observed in unstimulated cultures. Unexpectedly, unlike genuine MSCs, culturing cATMSCs in adipogenic differentiation medium did not result in the intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets. Other baseline traits of this novel cell population included that they were clonogenic and had a cell duplication time of about 5 days.",
        "Interestingly, cATMSCs were also shown to preserve the myocardium, when delivered intramyocardially in postinfarcted mice and rats [22]. The engrafted cells expressed cardiac (troponin I, sarcomeric α-actinin) and endothelial (CD31) markers, and their administration was associated with enhanced myocardial vascularization and reductions in infarct size. Moreover, in terms of cardiac function, significant differences between control and cell-treated groups were found in fractional shortening and the ejection fraction; moreover, in the treated group, the anterior walls of the heart remained significantly thicker 30 days after cardiac delivery of cATMSCs compared to those of the control group.",
        "Together with their recognized regenerative potential, MSCs have been linked to immune regulation through modulation of monocyte polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype [23, 24] and interference in dendritic cell maturation [25]. For instance, Wharton’s jelly-derived MSCs powerfully inhibit the inflammatory response of stimulated T cells [26]. In this way, cATMSCs also abrogated T-cell proliferation upon stimulation with allogeneic mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells [27]. In a coculture setting, similar to the well-established nonimmunogenic UCBMSCs, increasing amounts of cATMSCs suppressed the alloproliferation of T cells in a dose-dependent manner, and specifically modulated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ). Of note, these findings suggest that cATMSCs could regulate a potentially harmful immune response, despite the reported short lifespan of MSCs after infusion in vivo.",
        "UCB is considered the most plentiful reservoir of stem cells for many clinical applications. Although UCB was commonly used to treat blood disorders, the spectrum of diseases for which it provides effective therapy has been expanded to include numerous nonhematopoietic conditions [28–30]. Consequently, the number of blood services/UCB banks established worldwide has continued to grow to accumulate sufficient supplies of donated units to meet the demands of cell transplantation. In addition to hematopoietic progenitor cells, UCB also contains nonhematopoietic cell types that can be readily isolated and grown ex vivo. MSCs represent one of the additional cell populations found in UCB. In short, UCBMSCs comprise a population of multipotent progenitor cells that can support hematopoiesis in bone marrow niches, differentiate into mesenchymal cell lineages (i.e., osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lines), and display immune modulatory activity [31, 32]. Cell growth assays performed in our laboratory showed that UCBMSC proliferation, measured as the cell duplication time, was close to 2 days [33].",
        "In past years, studies have exposed UCBMSCs to a myriad of cardiomyogenic stimuli and failed to achieve transdifferentiation to a cardiac lineage [34]. Nevertheless, through those studies, UCBMSCs have garnered a great deal of attention, which stimulated studies on the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating angiogenesis [35], the induction of vascular growth in vivo [36], and methods for preclinically predicting the immunogenicity of prospective stem cells [27]. For instance, although direct contact with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes could effectively induce a cardiomyocyte-like phenotype in cATMSCs [22], it did not promote the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins, rhythmic calcium oscillations, or potential-dependent fluorescence emissions in these cells [34]. In the following, we also describe how UCBMSC-embedded fibrin patches could not effectively induce cardiac-specific markers, such as cTnI, in MI hearts [36, 37].",
        "Despite the apparent divergent nature of cATMSCs and UCBMSCs, they share promising cardiovascular potential and immune regulatory capabilities. Thus, both can be immunologically safe and valuable for clinical use. However, cATMSCs are typically extracted from older donors, with intrinsic characteristics and risk factors that might lead to poor stem cell functionality. Another restriction associated with cATMSCs is that, because these cells are located in cardiac adipose tissue, they are not readily accessible. Nevertheless, cardiac fat biopsies for cATMSC isolation can be obtained easily via left lateral thoracotomy prior to coronary artery bypass surgery in patients with stable ischemia. Moreover, other procedures can be envisioned. Indeed, a large number of cardiac interventions are routinely performed in every major hospital, and each of these interventions provides an opportunity for obtaining a cardiac fat biopsy with negligible additional risk to the patient or cost to the healthcare system. Alternatively, a UCB sample can be safely, painlessly extracted for subsequent MSC isolation, and these UCBMSCs can be cryopreserved for a long time without losing regenerative and “immunoprivileged” properties. Furthermore, UCB carries a lower risk of transmitting viral infections or somatic mutations, compared to adult tissues. In the context of cell-based therapies, UCBMSCs require less culture time than cATMSCs to achieve ex-vivo expansion to a fixed number of cells; therefore, UCBMSCs are less likely to display apoptotic traits. However, both cATMSCs and UCBMSCs may be potentially expanded and banked for later allogeneic use. Nevertheless, several crucial challenges remain. First, more accurate quality and potency assays are needed to achieve UCB-based product manufacturing and to gain accreditation; second, broad agreements are needed between the international research community and blood services/UCB banks to support active collaborations and to make use of small-volume UCB units that are now discarded [30].",
        "Since biophysical signals to which cardiac cells are exposed constantly and specifically may also affect stem cell functions once implanted, we designed a novel ad-hoc device for supplying electrical and mechanical stimuli, individually or synchronously, to condition stem cell culture monolayers. Once developed, we examined the cardiomyogenic effects of these stimuli. For example, we tested whether they mimicked the cardiac environment, induced the maturation of trained cATMSCs [38], and promoted their integration into postinfarcted myocardium in mice [39, 40].",
        "Remarkably, when electromechanical conditioning was applied to cATMSCs, in vitro, they displayed a cardiomyogenic-like phenotype [38, 39]. When tested in a murine MI model, conditioned cATMSCs drove the recovery of cardiac function and increased the density of myocardial vasculature [40]. In particular, at 21 days after implantation of an electromechanically conditioned cATMSC–fibrin patch, the left ventricular ejection fraction increased up to 12% in stimulated grafts, compared to untreated animals. Graft vascularization and integration with the host blood supply also resulted in increased vessel density in the infarct border region. Trained cells placed in the implanted fibrin patch also exhibited primary cardiac markers and migrated into the underlying ischemic myocardium. These studies pioneered the benefits of electromechanically stimulated cells in an in-vivo scenario. They showed that this physiological strategy held promise for stem cell training (either in cell suspension or within engineered tissue) before cell implantation to recover cardiac function post MI. In our opinion, although the question of how to produce greater numbers of trained cells remains unresolved, this technology is ready to undergo preclinical testing.",
        "As mentioned previously, most efforts in the field of cardiac regeneration after MI have focused on cell therapy. Clinically, the vast majority of reported studies, mostly using bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (revised in [41]), are intricate to compare because the delivered cells are either mixed or enriched populations, and the number of implanted cells, delivery methods, and injection time intervals are not usually comparable. Other experiences have included MSCs harvested from bone marrow aspirates [42, 43], subcutaneous adipose tissue [44], and Wharton’s jelly [45]. In general, studies have commonly employed the intracoronary or intramyocardial cell delivery routes, and use of these routes has been associated with low ratios of cell engraftment and survival. Hence, despite being safe and technologically feasible, conventional cell therapy approaches in humans have not reproduced the benefits in cardiac function restoration observed in preclinical animal models, because of the difficulties involved in repairing usually large myocardial scars and because of the low efficacy of administered cells, due to low retention rates, poor survival, and lack of differentiation. Consequently, increasingly more studies are based on techniques involving cardiac TE, which aims to combine stem cells with synthetic or natural scaffolds with characteristics very similar to those of native myocardial tissue. Once locally delivered/implanted in the infarcted area, these innovative bioactive constructs can integrate effectively into target tissues to regenerate myocardial scars and improve cardiac function [46, 47].",
        "Regarding natural scaffolding materials for cardiac repair after MI, collagen scaffold-associated benefits have been observed in different MI models using subcutaneous adipose tissue-derived MSCs [48, 49]. In rats, MSCs from brown adipose tissue also improved cardiac function and contractility when applied into the infarcted area inside a chitosan scaffold [50]. Other in-vivo experiences have included the use of alginate, hyaluronic acid, gelatin, and matrigel (revised in [51]). Alternatively, our group has evaluated the implantation of fibrin as a scaffold material for cardiac repair (revised in [37]). Thus, we generated 3D engineered fibrin patches filled with cATMSCs or UCBMSCs and delivered them to postinfarcted myocardium in mice [36, 40, 52]. Fibrin patches filled with stem cells can be placed on top of myocardium undergoing scarring. This procedure avoids many of the drawbacks of conventional cell-infusion systems. Fibrin has several advantages; it can be extracted from the patient’s blood; it is easily readjusted; the implantation procedure is simple; it promotes viability and early proliferation in delivered cells; and it provides benefits, even when a fibrin patch does not contain cells. In our studies, new functional vascular growth and improved cardiac function were commonly observed in animals treated with fibrin–MSC patches. However, the fates of implanted cells appeared to depend on the cell type. Implanted UCBMSCs exclusively contributed to vascular growth, and implanted cATMSCs exhibited cardiac and endothelial properties. In some of these pioneering studies, we employed noninvasive bioluminescence imaging to track the behavior and survival of implanted cells [36, 52]. We found that, although fibrin patches enhanced MSC retention, their migration toward injured myocardium and survival were limited, regardless of the MSC origin. These restrictions limited the therapeutic outcomes. In addition, we had to scale up the production of fibrin–cell patches to achieve comparable or better results in humans.",
        "Other studies have commonly employed swine as the translational model for delivering microporous membranes filled with cATMSCs after MI. In particular, in these studies, scaffolds from porcine myocardium or human pericardium have been assessed [53–57]. Succinctly, these scaffolds comprised a filamentous extracellular matrix, from which all cellular and nuclear content are removed in a process called decellularization. After decellularization, these natural scaffolds preserved fiber disposition and structure; promoted high levels of cell repopulation; closely matched the native, physiological microenvironment; preserved the inherent stiffness, composition, vasculature network, and 3-D framework of myocardium; and enabled electromechanical coupling with the host myocardium upon implantation. Moreover, once implanted in the ischemic myocardium, these engineered bioimplants improved cardiac function, reduced infarct size, attenuated fibrosis progression, and promoted both neovascularization and neoinnervation. Thus, we concluded that cardiac TE provided promising beneficial effects without any identified adverse side effects, facilitating its clinical translation.",
        "As also mentioned previously, our laboratory was the first to describe the cardioreparative potential of the adipose tissue that surrounds the heart and pericardium, and we proposed cATMSCs as a prospective source of MSCs and a biological matrix. We also envisioned a novel approach (AGTP) for integrating cardiac adipose tissue-derived cell therapy with TE for repairing damaged myocardium. In the AGTP, a vascularized adipose flap was transpositioned over the infarcted area, which we demonstrated in the porcine MI model [58, 59]. However, recently, the risks associated with open chest surgery have brought about the advent of alternative surgical approaches; in addition, it might be beneficial to provide the AGTP to patients who do not need coronary artery bypass grafts. Consequently, we reasoned that a minimally invasive AGTP approach (mi-AGTP) would be desirable for clinical settings. Therefore, we assessed the mi-AGTP in the swine model with thoracoscopy [60]. This novel surgical technique provided beneficial effects for left ventricular function and inhibited myocardial remodeling following acute MI [58]. We then assessed the effect of postinfarction scar coverage with the AGTP in a pig model of chronic MI. There, the flap was placed on the scar 2 weeks after artery occlusion with a coil. One month after the AGTP, histopathologic analysis confirmed a reduction in infarct size and the presence of vascular connections at the flap–myocardium interface. Nevertheless, at the functional level, we did not detect significant changes in LV ejection fraction or end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes [59]. Thus, this innovative approach took advantage of local existing tissue to limit the size of the infarct scar, which simplified the surgical procedure and potentially avoided the risks associated with nonautologous cells manipulated ex vivo [61]. Thus, the AGTP intervention is expected to be readily adaptable to clinical practice; it is technically simple, it does not require additional or expensive material, and it does not incur any ethical or social concerns that could constrain its employment. Of note, we reported the first-in-man clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01473433, AdiFLAP Trial—AGTP-I), which investigated the safety and efficacy of the AGTP in patients with chronic MIs who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery [62]. Our experience demonstrated that the AGTP was safe; treated patients showed trends of smaller left ventricular end-systolic volume and smaller necrosis ratios. However, the AGTP did not completely reverse myocardial dysfunction. These encouraging results led to an ongoing 1-year follow-up multicenter randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02798276, AGTP-II) to test AGTP efficacy. Eligible patients included candidates for surgical revascularization in one or more myocardial areas with a nonrevascularizable area. The trial was designed to validate the ability of AGTP to reduce necrotic areas [63].",
        "To date, much effort has been focused on developing allogeneic cell therapy products, such as MSC-based therapies, in accordance with current regulations [64] (Table 2). Using allogeneic versus autologous MSCs offers several advantages. Allogeneic MSCs can potentially be preserved in banks, they can be characterized comprehensively at the time of clinical use, and they cost less to produce than autologous MSCs. The large-scale production of allogeneic MSC-based products requires a variety of specialized facilities, skilled personnel, and sufficient financial resources to generate safe and effective cells consistently, from batch to batch, in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations. The main milestones in the development process of MSC-based therapies for cardiac tissue regeneration are summarized schematically in Fig. 2 [65, 66]. Producing sufficient numbers of cells to support clinical trials, from first in man to phase II, is feasible in small GMP facilities, such as those found in academic institutions, hospitals, and blood banks [67]. Subsequently, complying with GMP in non-Pharma environments requires a strategy based on gradually increasing product quality. Therefore, non-Pharma environments must be capable of consistent, future production of market-approved, advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), including cell and gene medicinal products, tissue-engineered products, and combined ATMPs. In addition, personnel must be trained and manufacturing processes must be optimized [68]. ATMPs that are not intended for marketing and are not industrially prepared are placed outside the standard Directive (2001/83/EC) and Regulations (726/2004). This placement is commonly called a “hospital exemption”; it is restricted to ATMPs that are “prepared on a non-routine basis, according to specific quality standards, and used within the same Member State in a hospital, under the exclusive professional responsibility of a medical practitioner, in order to comply with an individual medical prescription for a custom-made product for an individual patient” [69].Table 2Relevant guidelines and regulations in developing MSC-based medicines for treating myocardial infarctionGuidelines and regulationsGeneral•European Medicines Agency Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007, Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (amends Directive 2001/83/EC, 6 November 2001, O.J.

        "Remarkably, a number of treatments involving MSCs are undergoing clinical testing, despite the associated challenges and costs [70, 71]. Most of these treatments rely on open/semi-open systems, which are labor intensive, require manual processing, and represent high investments in classified environments. Moreover, open/semi-open systems are associated with considerable, increasing costs, risk of contamination, variability across batches, and a lack of real-time process control. However, there has been a tendency toward developing automated platforms, including bioreactors, which may simplify the workflow and optimize resources. These platforms have increasingly impacted the robustness, traceability, and yields of clinical-grade cells; they have reduced the cost of production; and they have incorporated in-process controls that provide predictions of compliance with final product specifications [72, 73].",
        "In developing cell media formulations, it is important to highlight the fact that animal-derived growth supplements are discouraged in the manufacture of MSCs, because they may lead to unwanted clinical effects. Most of these supplements have undergone limited characterization, and they might harbor potential animal pathogens that remain obscure. Thus, it is imperative to validate alternative media formulations suitable for large-scale expansion of cATMSCs. Although human supplements, such as human serum (HS), might have advantages over fetal bovine serum (FBS), current studies have shown that MSCs performed better in cultures supplemented with FBS rather than HS. This issue needs to be addressed early in the design of large-scale production strategies. Growth medium conditions must be devoid of substances derived from animals (xenogenic) and human products (i.e., HS and platelet lysate) and optimized with fully defined (ideally chemically defined) media formulations [70, 74]. Novel cell culture technologies and regulatory issues regarding MSC manufacturing substantially increase the overall production costs. Therefore, it is advisable to optimize MSC isolation, expansion, and storage procedures first, and then to store MSCs in master cell banks; later, the MSCs can be validated in serum-free, animal component-free reagents at the time of clinical use.",
        "It is important to highlight that increasing GMP compliance is expected to be accomplished during the clinical development of any ATMP. In the case of master cell banks of MSC for allogeneic use, it is likely that reagents and procedures may differ between investigational and commercial manufacturing, as well as along phases of the clinical studies. In these cases, if a single master cell bank is expected to last the lifecycle of the final product, greater control over the process is required, including revalidation of master cell banks and/or the working cell bank. We typically use assays addressing product toxicity, viability, identity, purity, and potency [67, 75].",
        "The cardiovascular potential of UCBMSCs and cATMSCs has been assessed extensively in our laboratory. Our work advanced the concept that living cells seeded onto appropriately configured scaffolds could generate new tissues or organs. This approach was rapidly recognized as an alternative therapy that facilitated self-repair, reversed or attenuated adverse remodeling, and ultimately achieved long-term functional stabilization and improved heart function. The great cardiomyogenic potential exhibited by cATMSCs was also observed in large mammals, such as swine, which is the preferred preclinical model, due to its high similarity to humans. However, access to sufficient numbers of cells following standardized cell culture conditions represents a major challenge for future clinical use. Moreover, therapeutic outcomes could be limited by poor stem cell functionality, due to donor characteristics, like intrinsic pathophysiological conditions, comorbidities, and cardiovascular risk factors. Ideally, cATMSCs should be isolated with minimally invasive procedures from young donors with no cardiac pathology, no comorbidities, and no cardiovascular risk factors. Once expanded in vitro, these theoretically highly-active stem cells could be banked for later allogeneic use. In addition, in-depth studies are crucial for elucidating the immunomodulatory actions and mechanisms for the resolution of inflammation and regeneration of injured tissue by cATMSCs and UCBMSCs. These effects could be firstly mediated temporarily by paracrine mediators, but secondarily by the modulation of the host’s immune cells. On the other hand, UCBMSCs have exhibited promising vascular potential, both in vitro and in vivo, but their cardiomyogenic potential appeared to be somewhat limited. Indeed, UCBMSCs constitute a valuable model for analyzing mechanisms that govern vascular growth for tissue repair. However, in basic research, such as our TE studies, UCBMSC use has been restricted, in part, due to the lack of a broad consensus among UCB banks for collaborations, and in part due to the limited availability of small-volume UCB units, which are generally discarded.",
        "Regarding our experiences with TE, despite the finding that fibrin patches could enhance the survival and function of implanted cells, the benefits were modest and clinical translation is currently impractical. In contrast, bioactive engineered grafts or bioprostheses can be generated by combining cATMSCs with acellular cardiac scaffolds that display preserved cardiac extracellular matrix proteins. The intrinsic structural and mechanical properties of those grafts may be better suited for restoring cardiac function post MI. However, it might not be necessary to isolate and manipulate cells ex vivo, because the AGTP constitutes a reliable step toward a new option for treating heart failure after MI. Therefore, based on our good preclinical results, we believe this is the right time for clinical translation of decellularized matrices derived from cardiac tissue biopsies. Accordingly, we are now facing complex regulatory concerns to assemble a cell product based in some of our extensively investigated MSCs or additional sources with a scaffold that is highly similar to native myocardium and practically devoid of DNA content. To that end, it is essential to meet the requirements of GMP by handling the final product strictly according to the guidelines of the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Healthcare Products.",

However, their therapeutic efficacy and duration are hampered due to their limited retention on the epicardium. We engineered a scaffold-free MSC sheet with an inherent ability to migrate into the infarcted myocardium, a strategy enabled by actively establishing a sustained intracellular hypoxic environment through the endocytosis of our FDA-approved ferumoxytol. This iron oxide nanoparticle stabilized hypoxia-induced factor-1alpha, triggering upregulation of the CXC chemokine receptor and subsequent MSC chemotaxis. Thus, MSCs integrated into 2/3 depth of the left ventricular anterior wall in a rat model of acute myocardial infarction and persisted for at least 28 days. This led to spatiotemporal delivery of paracrine factors by MSCs, enhancing cardiac regeneration and function. Ferumoxytol also facilitated the noninvasive MRI tracking of implanted MSCs. Our approach introduces a strategy for mobilizing MSC migration, holding promise for rapid clinical translation in myocardial infarction treatment.

        "Nucleic acid drugs are driving a revolution in healthcare and changing the paradigm of disease treatment with their potential to target almost any gene, highly efficient and specific gene silencing capabilities, single-dose efficacy lasting up to several months, short discovery cycles, and high success rates in research and experimental development [1,2]. They also serve as valuable tools for developing therapeutic targets. Even when the pathogenesis of many diseases remains unclear, once a specific target is identified, nucleic acid drugs can be used to silence, upregulate, or replace the associated genes. This process is faster than the development of small molecule chemical drugs or antibody drugs [3,4]. Additionally, nucleic acid drugs exhibit higher success rates in clinical development compared to chemical and antibody drugs. However, the in vivo application of nucleic acid drugs faces significant challenges, including susceptibility to nuclease degradation, poor compatibility with cell membranes, hydrophilicity, and difficulty escaping endosomes or lysosomes. Thus, the effectiveness of nucleic acid drugs largely depends on efficient delivery technologies [5,6].",
        "Currently, nucleic acid drugs on the market primarily utilize delivery technologies such as chemical modifications, conjugates, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), and viral vectors [[7], [8], [9]]. These technologies have demonstrated irreplaceable advantages in providing efficient and long-lasting therapeutic effects for rare diseases and metabolic disorders. However, for extrahepatic diseases, only a few nucleic acid drugs have been commercialized due to the lack of effective delivery methods [10,11]. Consequently, there is a substantial clinical demand for nucleic acid drugs targeting extrahepatic diseases. Furthermore, extrahepatic organs such as the lungs, brain, eyes, skin, joints, and heart are particularly suitable for topical administration due to considerations of bioavailability, ease of handling, and patient compliance. In particular, localized drug delivery can significantly enhance the targeting ability of nucleic acid drugs in specific organs. Compared to systemic drug delivery, localized delivery reduces the risk of systemic toxicity, requires lower doses, and necessitates less frequent administrations. This has made it a critical strategy for delivering nucleic acid drugs to non-hepatic targets [12]. Nevertheless, each organ has unique biological barriers and delivery challenges, necessitating the development of tailored delivery technologies based on the characteristics of the target diseases.",
        "This review primarily summarizes and discusses the current advances in localized nucleic acid drug therapeutics for extrahepatic disease (Fig. 1). Firstly, the classification, characterization, and mechanisms of nucleic acid drugs, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), aptamers (Apts), plasmid DNAs (pDNAs), messager RNAs (mRNAs), and clustered regularly interspaced short polymorphic repeats (CRISPR), are concisely described. Secondly, the main nucleic acid drug delivery technologies, including conjugates, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), polymer nanoparticles (PNPs), biomimetic nanoparticles (BNPs), inorganic nanoparticles (INPs), and DNA origami-based nanomaterials, are outlined. Thirdly, the bio-barriers of the lungs, brain, eyes, skin, joints, and heart are analyzed, alongside the approaches for local administration to these organs. Furthermore, strategies and advancements in delivery technologies designed to overcome these biological barriers are highlighted. Finally, the review outlines the potential of local nucleic acid drug delivery, discusses its current limitations, and provides an outlook on future advancements in the field.Fig. 1Scheme of locally administered nucleic acid therapeutics for extrahepatic diseases.

        "Nucleic acid drugs are a class of DNA- or RNA-based therapeutics that regulate gene expression through Watson-Crick base pairing. The main types of nucleic acid drugs include ASOs, miRNAs, siRNAs, Apts, pDNAs, mRNAs, and CRISPR. In this section, the characteristics and mechanisms of these nucleic acid drugs are described and compared. Other types of nucleic acid drugs, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) [13], and small activating RNAs (saRNAs) [14,15], are not discussed in this manuscript. However, they also play important roles in gene expression regulation, protein synthesis, and disease treatment.",
        "ASOs are the earliest-discovered and most widely approved class of small nucleic acid drugs. ASOs are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules ranging from 8 to 50 nucleotides in length and were the first RNA interference (RNAi) drugs to be developed. To date, a total of 14 ASO drugs have been approved for clinical use. Among them, three ASO drugs are administered via local injection. ASOs were first proposed in 1978, when Zamecnik and Stephenson discovered their ability to inhibit the translation of Rous sarcoma virus RNA [16]. In 1998, the first ASO drug (Fomivirsen) approved for marketing was utilized for antiviral gene therapy for cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMV) via vitreous injection [17]. In 2016, Spinraza from Sarepta was approved to treat spinal muscular atrophy via intrathecal administration [18]. More recently, in 2023, Qalsody (Tofersen) from Ionis Pharmaceuticals was approved to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also via intrathecal administration [19]. The mechanism of ASO is shown in Fig. 2a. ASOs primarily exert their effects through three mechanisms: 1) RNase H-mediated mRNA degradation: by forming a heterodimeric double strand with the target mRNA, ASOs recruit ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzyme, which degrades the mRNA; 2) Steric blocking of translation: by acting as a spatial blocker of ribosomes, ASOs prevent the translation of target mRNA; 3) Modulation of splicing: by binding to pre-mRNA, ASOs alter its splicing, thereby regulating the production of mature mRNA [20,21].Fig. 2Mechanisms of nucleic acid drugs. a) Three mechanisms of ASO: RNase H-mediated mRNA degradation, steric blocking of translation, and modulation of splicing. b) The mechanism of siRNA. AGO recruits siRNA antisense strands to form RISC. Depending on the degree of complementarity between the siRNA and the target mRNA, RISC lead to mRNA degradation. c) The mechanism of miRNA. miRNA regulates gene expression after transcription by promoting mRNA degradation and inhibiting mRNA translation. d) The mechanism of pDNA. The pDNA is transcribed into mRNA in the nucleus. Subsequently, mRNA is translated into proteins in the cytoplasm. e) The mechanism and forms of mRNA. mRNA is the template for protein synthesis. In the cytoplasm, mRNA binds to ribosomes and is translated into proteins. There are three forms of mRNA: non-replicating mRNA, self-amplifying mRNA, and looped mRNA. f) The mechanism and forms of CRISPR. There are three forms of CRISPR: CRISPR/Cas all in one pDNA, gRNA and Cas mRNA, and CRISPR RNP. CRISPR/Cas allows for gene knockouts, insertions, and replacements.Fig. 2",

        "siRNAs, double-stranded ribonucleotides typically 21–23 nucleotides in length, are currently the most widely used RNAi drugs. In 2003, siRNAs were first applied in therapeutic studies on mammals. The first clinical trial involving siRNA was conducted in 2004. It was not until 2018 that the first siRNA drug, Onpattro, was approved for the treatment of neurological injury disorders [7]. To date, six siRNA drugs have been approved for clinical use [22,23]. The other five are GalNAc-based siRNA conjugates. GalNAc binds to glycoprotein receptors, which are highly expressed on hepatocytes, resulting in the efficient uptake of siRNA by the cells [8]. The mechanism of siRNA is shown in Fig. 2b. Argonaute (AGO) enzymes are essential for siRNA-mediated gene silencing. AGO selectively recruits the antisense strand of siRNA to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Afterwards, the siRNA duplex is unwound, and the antisense strand is incorporated into RISC to recruit mRNA via base complementary pairing. Finally, the AGO enzymes catalyze RISC to induce the degradation of target mRNA [24].",
        "miRNAs are short-stranded RNAs, 19–22 nucleotides in length, encoded by the genomes of eukaryotic cells. The mechanism of miRNAs is illustrated in Fig. 2c, miRNAs are initially transcribed in the nucleus in the form of DNA. Then, the primary miRNA is formed by transcription in the presence of enzymes. The pri-miRNAs are then processed by Drosha and DGCR8 enzymes to form precursor miRNAs. After being transported to the cytoplasm, the miRNA duplexes recruit AGO enzymes to form RISC complexes. Through RISCs, miRNAs regulate gene expression by either promoting the degradation of target mRNA or inhibiting its translation. This regulation ultimately influences cellular processes such as development, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [25]. Notably, in contrast to ASOs or siRNAs, miRNAs do not require perfect sequence complementarity with their target mRNAs. Instead, they attenuate and modulate mRNA expression rather than completely suppressing it. Additionally, miRNAs can regulate multiple genes simultaneously, lacking the specificity of siRNAs or ASOs for individual target genes [26]. Beyond their application as gene therapy agents, miRNAs are widely used as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and as indicators of therapeutic efficacy.",
        "Apts are single-stranded DNA or RNA sequences screened by Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), possessing specific secondary structures, such as hairpins, stem-loops, pseudoknots, and G-quadruplexes [27,28]. The secondary structures of aptamers do not exist in isolation; rather, they often interact and transform dynamically to facilitate binding to various target molecules and perform specific biological functions. These secondary structures can be assembled to form unique tertiary structures for specific recognition of target molecules. Apts were first discovered by Tuerk and Gold in 1990 [29]. Apts are often referred to as chemical antibodies. They are smaller in size, easier to be modified, more stable, and less costly than traditional antibodies [30]. In 2004, the first aptamer-based drug, Pegaptanib (Macugen), was approved for marketing by the FDA [31]. Pegaptanib was developed by Pfizer and Eyetech for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In 2023, Izervay (avacincaptad pegol) was approved for clinical use, also for intraocular injection to treat AMD [32]. In addition to their direct therapeutic effects directly as a nucleic acid drug, Apt can also be used as a targeting ligand. By conjugating with drugs, aptamers form aptamer-drug conjugates (ApDCs), which enable precise drug delivery to target cells and hold significant potential for clinical applications [33].",
        "pDNAs, loop-shaped DNA molecules, are primarily extracted from bacteria. pDNA exerts gene-augmenting function in the nuclei. This typically involves introducing genes or gene fragments directly into cells to replace or repair defective genes. As illustrated in Fig. 2d, pDNA is transcribed into mRNA in the nucleus. The mRNA then guides ribosomes to produce proteins, supplementing downregulated genes or replacing the mutated ones. The essential components of a pDNA include an origin of replication (ORI), resistance genes, multiple cloning sites (MCS), promoters, selective markers, reporter genes, enhancers, ribosome binding sites (RBS), and signal peptide sequences (SPS) et al. [34]. Many generalized plasmid frameworks are already available. The advantage of DNA drugs mainly lies in their stable structure. Researchers can modify these plasmids according to their requirements, enabling pDNAs to perform specific functions. In 2012, the first plasmid drug (Neovasculgen) was approved for marketing in Russia [35]. Neovasculgen mainly promotes the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) gene to treat atherosclerosis.",
        "mRNA was first discovered in 1961 and introduced into mammals in 1992 [36,37]. In 2001, mRNA clinical trials were conducted through the transfection of isolated dendritic cells for tumor therapy [38]. In 2020, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna launched two mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, further advancing the research and application of mRNA-based therapies in large-scale public health applications [39,40]. Several mRNA therapies are currently in clinical trials. The three primary therapeutic areas currently under exploration for mRNA drugs include immunotherapy, protein replacement therapy, and regenerative medicine [41]. In contrast to DNA drugs, mRNA drugs do not need to enter the nucleus. Instead, mRNA directly guides ribosomes in the cytoplasm to produce proteins (Fig. 2e). This characteristic eliminates the risk of genomic insertion and associated mutations. Compared to antibody drugs, mRNA drugs are more affordable to produce, have shorter treatment cycles, and require less frequent administration.",
        "Nowadays, mRNA drugs can exert their effects in three forms: non-replicating linear mRNAs, self-amplifying mRNAs, and looped mRNAs. Among these, non-replicating linear mRNAs are the most widely used, with a well-established extraction process. However, a major challenge lies in their structural instability. Significant research has been devoted to modifying mRNA structures, including the 5′-cap, 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs), coding regions, and poly(A) tails [42]. For instance, Wang et al. synthesized topologically and chemically modified mRNAs with multiple poly(A) tails, significantly extending their activity in vivo from less than 7 days–14 days [43]. Self-amplifying mRNAs, containing a replicase structure, can self-replicate in vivo, enabling prolonged expression and lower dosing requirements [44,45]. Meanwhile, their larger vector fragments present challenges in purification and loading. Looped mRNAs do not require capping or polyadenylation and exhibit long-lasting and stable expression [46]. Despite these advantages, circular mRNAs face issues such as low cyclization efficiency and difficulties in amplification and purification [47].",
        "In addition, in order to enhance the precision and functionality of mRNAs, some researchers have optimized mRNA sequences by combining them with specific miRNAs. Moderna dopes mRNA sequences with regulatory sequences of miRNAs to initiate the expression of target mRNAs in specific cells [48]. CureVac dopes miRNA binding sites into mRNA sequences, enabling precise intervention of mRNA expression in specific tissues [49].",
        "CRISPR is currently the most powerful and widely used gene editing tool. CRISPR, standing for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, was discovered by Doudna and Charpentier in 2012. It works by targeting specific genomic sites with the assistance of single-stranded guide RNA (sgRNA), which enables the CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) nuclease to cleave the DNA at these designated sites [50]. In 2013, Feng Zhang designated CRISPR in mammalian therapeutic research [51]. In 2023, the FDA approved the first CRISPR gene editing therapy, CASGEVY, developed by CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex. This innovative therapy focuses on editing the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A) gene in CD34+ human hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells via CRISPR/Cas9. The edited cells are subsequently infused back into patients to alleviate vaso-occlusive crises in individuals with sickle cell disease [52].",
        "The mechanism of CRISPR/Cas9 is shown in Fig. 2f [53].There are three primary methods for delivering CRISPR/Cas components: 1) universal pDNAs that encoding both the Cas nuclease and sgRNA; 2) the combination of Cas nuclease mRNA and sgRNA; and 3) the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which consists of Cas nuclease and sgRNA [54,55]. These three approaches ultimately play a major role in both Cas9 nuclease and sgRNA. Using the Cas protein and sgRNA, double-stranded DNA can be knocked out, knocked in, or replaced. In addition to the Cas9 protein, other commonly used CRISPR-associated nucleases include Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14 [56]. The relevant information regarding these Cas nucleases is summarized in Table 1. And the characteristics of the nucleic acid drugs mentioned in this review are summarized in Table 2.Table 1The classification and characteristics of Cas nucleases.Table 1ProteinNuclease domainsCleavage patternSize (amino acids)TargetPAMGuide RNArefCas 9RuvC, HNHCleave dsDNA at blunt ends∼1000–1600dsDNANGGsgRNA[57]Cas 12aRuvC, NucCleave dsDNA at 5′ overhangs staggered ends∼1300dsDNA(T)TTNcrRNA[58]Cas 12bRuvCStaggered seven nucleotide cut of target dsDNA∼1100dsDNATTNsgRNA[59]Cas 13a2 HEPNCleave ssRNA at near uracil and collateral sites∼1300ssRNA–crRNA[60]Cas 13b2 HEPNCleave ssDNA at 3′ protospacer flanking site∼1200ssRNA–crRNA[61]Cas 14aRuvCCleave ssDNA at 5′ overhangs∼400–700ssDNA–sgRNA[62]Table 2The classification and characteristics of nucleic acid drugs.Table 2Nucleic acid drugStructureMechanismFirst discoverySizeTargetSiteASOssDNA/RNAmRNA degradation, translation block, splicing modulation19788-50 nucleotidesmRNA, pre-mRNAcytoplasmsiRNAdsRNAmRNA degradation199821-23 nucleotidesmRNAcytoplasmmiRNAdsRNAmRNA degradation, translation repression199319-22 nucleotidesmRNAcytoplasmAptssDNA/RNASpecific binding to target molecules199010-50 nucleotidesproteinextracellularpDNAcyclic DNAGene augmentation195213-106 base pairsDNAnucleusmRNAssRNAProtein expression1961500-105 nucleotidesmRNAcytoplasmCRISPRgRNA, Cas nucleaseGene editing1987gRNADNA, RNAnucleus, cytoplasm",

        "Nucleic acid drugs individually fail to become drugs due to their instability, short half-life, easy to be rapidly cleared by kidney, and lack of focal targeting. Therefore, the delivery of nucleic acid drugs is critical for their successful application. Based on their characteristics, nucleic acid drug delivery systems can be classified into conjugates, LNPs, PNPs, BNPs, INPs, and DNA origami-based nanomaterials. In this section, the structures and characteristics of nucleic acid drug delivery technologies are illustrated.",
        "RNA-based nucleic acid drugs modified with chemical molecules are commonly used for delivery. Initially, deoxythymidine dinucleotide (dTdT) overhangs were simply employed to enhance the stability of siRNAs. Nowadays, siRNA modifications have become highly diverse, encompassing three main types: phosphate skeleton modifications, ribose modifications, and base modifications. Commonly used chemical modifications include cholesterol [63], lipids [64], alkyl chains [65], sugar chains [8], and peptides [66]. Hydrophobic modifications, in particular, can enhance the half-life of siRNAs in vivo by facilitating their binding to lipoproteins [67]. Among the six siRNA drugs approved for clinical use, five are siRNA conjugates (four delivery technologies from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and one delivery technology from Novo Nordisk/Dicerna Pharmaceuticals). However, these approved siRNA drugs are exclusively used for treating liver-related diseases and have limited applicability for extrahepatic diseases. A promising innovation in this field is multivalent nucleic acid drugs. Multivalent siRNAs, which consist of two or more siRNAs linked by covalent bonds, have been shown to prolong systemic circulation and reduce susceptibility to renal clearance [4]. As shown in Fig. 3, Anastasia Khvorova et al. investigated the enrichment and gene silencing effects of monovalent, multivalent (divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent) modified siRNAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-modified siRNAs, and docosanoic acid (DCA)-modified siRNAs via topical lung administration [68]. The results showed that multivalent siRNA were more effectively enriched in the lungs compared to hydrophobically modified siRNAs. Moreover, trivalent and tetravalent siRNAs exhibited superior enrichment compared to bivalent siRNAs, highlighting the potential of multivalent siRNAs for siRNA conjugate local delivery development.Fig. 3Representative siRNA conjugates and fluorescence images of lung after local administration [68].

        "LNPs are variants of liposomes. Liposomes are spherical, bilayered phospholipid vesicles with a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic outer layer. The structure of LNPs is diverse. LNPs can be formed by self-assembly of a monolayer of lipid molecules with multiple cores (Fig. 4a). They can also be multilayered vesicles and homogeneous core-shell vesicles [69].Fig. 4Structures of LNPs and lipid molecules used for nucleic acid drug delivery. a) Structures of LNPs. b) Chemical structures of lipid molecules. 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (chloride salt) (DOTAP) [[70], [71], [72]], 1,2-di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (chloride salt) (DOTMA) [73], 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (chloride salt) (DPTAP), 1,1'-((2-(4-(2-((2-(bis(2-hydroxydodecyl)amino)ethyl)(2-hydroxydodecyl)amino)ethyl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)azanediyl)bis(dodecan-2-ol) (C12-200) [74], didecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) [75], 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-poly(ethylene glycol) (DSPE-PEG) [76,75], 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) [77,78], 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) [79], 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) [77], 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) [23,76,[80], [81], [82], [83], [84], [85]], 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-polycarboxybetaine (DSPE-PCB) [86], α-(3'-[[1,2-di(myristyloxy)propanoxy] carbonylamino]propyl)-ω-methoxy (PEG2000-C-DMG) [23], 1, 2-dimethylstyrene-rac-glycerin-3-methoxy-polyethylene glycol (PEG-DMG) [71,74,[80], [81], [82],84,85], α-[2-(ditetradecylamino)-2-oxoethyl]-ω-methoxy-poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), PEG-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, Methoxypolyethyleneglycoloxy(2000)-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide (ALC-0159), 1, 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) [78], (6Z,9Z,28Z,31Z)-heptatriaconta-6,9,28,31-tetraen-19-yl 4-(dimethylamino)butanoate (DLin-MC3-DMA) [23,83,84], 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-(dimethylamino)propane (DODAP), 1,2-dioleyloxy-3-dimethylamino-propane (DODMA), heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl)(6-oxo-6-(undecyloxy)hexyl)amino)octanoate (SM-102) [87,81,82,85], N,N'-((methylazanediyl)bis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(4-(ditetradecylamino)butanamide) (GAE14) [77], 6-((2-hexyldecanoyl)oxy)-N-(6-((2-hexyldecanoyl)oxy)hexyl)-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)hexan-1-aminium (ALC-0315) [88].Fig. 4",

        "By pairing with lipid molecules of various properties, LNPs can be tailored to exhibit specialized functions. Typically, ionizable LNPs for nucleic acid drug delivery consist of cationic or ionizable lipids, helper lipids, PEG-containing lipids, and cholesterol [89]. The types and proportions of these lipids can be adjusted to produce LNPs with distinct characteristics. Cationic lipid molecules, such as DOTAP, DOTMA, and DPTAP, interact electrostatically with negatively charged nucleic acid drugs, facilitating their encapsulation. Furthermore, due to their ability to interact with negatively charged cell membranes and organelle membranes, cationic lipid molecules can further facilitate the cellular uptake of nucleic acid drugs and realize endosomal/lysosomal escape. Ionizable lipids, including DLin-MC3-DMA, DODAP, and DODMA, play a critical role in nucleic acid drug delivery. They have a pH-dependent ionization property. Ionizable lipids are electrically neutral in physiological conditions (pH 7.4). But in acidic environments (pH 5–6), they are rapidly protonated and become positively charged, aiding in efficient in vivo delivery and endosomal/lysosomal escape [90]. Neutral helper lipid molecules, such as DOPC, DOPE, and DSPC, can assist in nucleic acid drug encapsulation. Neutral lipid molecules exhibit high biocompatibility and remain stable under physiological conditions. PEG-containing lipid molecules improve the structural stability of LNPs and extend the circulation time of nucleic acid drugs in vivo. Notably, some PEG-substituted lipids, such as zwitterionic DSPE-PCB, do not elicit IgG antibody production, thereby avoiding rapid clearance upon repeated administration [86]. Cholesterol stabilizes the structure of LNPs and regulates membrane fluidity.",
        "The first siRNA drug, Patisiran (Onpattro), developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, utilizes LNPs as its delivery system. Its main components include cholesterol (38.5 %), DSPC (10 %), DLin-MC3-DMA (50 %), and PEG2000-C-DMG (1.5 %) [23]. Among these, DLin-MC3-DMA, with its pH-dependent charge-variable properties, significantly contributes to the therapeutic efficacy of siRNA. The first mRNA vaccine against COVID-19, COMIRNATY, delivered by LNP consisting of DSPC (9.4 %), cholesterol (42.7 %), ALC-0315 (46.3 %), and ALC-0159 (1.6 %) [91]. Similarly, the launched mRNA vaccine, Spikevax, also employs LNPs for delivery. The main components are SM-102 (50 %), DSPC (10 %), cholesterol (38.5 %), and PEG-2000 DMG (1.5 %). Hyeryun Choe's group analyzed and compared the effects of the ionizable lipid molecule ALC-0315 in COMIRNATY and SM-102 in Spikevax [87]. They found that SM-102 was more effective than ALC-0315 in mRNA delivery, antibody expression, and long-term stability at 4 °C.",
        "Some studies have also combined LNPs with inorganic tracers to further investigate the mechanism of LNPs in vitro and in vivo. Marino Zerial et al. encapsulated gold nanoparticles within LNPs to visualize and analyze the intracellular endosomes/lysosomes escape of LNPs by light and electron microscopy [92]. They found that about 1–2% siRNA can be released from endosomes/lysosomes and this release occurs only at a defined stage of endosomal progression. To non-invasively trace the circulating pathways of LNPs in vivo, Huang et al. doped LNPs with the MRI contrast agent Gd-DTPA-BSA component [76]. After tail vein injection, real-time MRI imaging of the tumor mice showed that the tumor-targeted modified LNPs displayed significant MRI signals at the tumor sites.",
        "Interestingly, emerging studies suggest that some intrinsic components in systemically injected LNPs, such as cholesterol and phospholipids, may not be essential for nucleic acid drug delivery [93,94]. However, it remains unclear whether similar findings apply to locally injected LNPs. The representative lipid molecules that mentioned in this review were shown in Fig. 4b.",
        "PNPs are mainly categorized into polymer complexes, dendrimers, and micelles (Fig. 5a). Polymers can be designed based on the properties of the target disease and the loaded drugs. Common cationic polymers include polyamino acids, polyethyleneimine (PEI), polyesters, and dendrimers [[95], [96], [97]]. These polymers form complexes with nucleic acid drugs through electrostatic interactions. Dendrimers are highly and precisely branched tree-like structures with a core, branching units, and terminal groups. The advantage of dendrimers is that the physicochemical properties can be adjusted to meet delivery requirements by adjusting the number of branching generations and terminal groups. Polymer micelles, on the other hand, are typically formed by amphiphilic block copolymers via hydrophilic and hydrophobic self-assembly interactions, with nucleic acid drugs subsequently loaded through electrostatic interactions.Fig. 5Representative structures of polymers used for nucleic acid drug delivery. a) Structures of PNPs. b) Chemical structures of polymers.

        "The electrical properties of PNPs are critical to their performance. Excessive positive charge can lead to cytotoxicity, whereas insufficient positivity may compromise nucleic acid drug loading and cellular internalization. PEI is one of the most commonly used cationic polymers, known for its efficient adsorption of nucleic acid drugs. However, its strong positive charge is associated with significant toxicity, which severely limits its applications. To address this limitation, Cho et al. developed an siRNA delivery vector (PS-PEI) by combining low molecular weight PEI with sorbitol diacrylate [101]. PS-PEI adsorbed siRNA targeting connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) to construct complexes (PS-PEI/siCTGF). The sorbitol diacrylate modification reduced the cytotoxicity of PEI and enhanced endosomal/lysosomal escape. PS-PEI/siCTGF complexes were administered transdermally to treat skin scarring in mice. The results demonstrated that PS-PEI/siCTGF significantly promoted skin repair in mice, outperforming the PEI/siCTGF group. The representative lipid molecules that mentioned in this review were shown in Fig. 5b.",
        "BNPs offer advantages such as long circulation time, good biocompatibility, and homologous-targeting ability, making them promising for nucleic acid drug delivery [112]. Among BNPs, membrane-based nanoparticles and extracellular vesicle (EV)-based nanoparticles are the most widely used for drug delivery.",
        "Membrane-based nanoparticles generally act as “nano-traps” by encapsulating drugs, PNPs, or INPs within bio-membranes (Fig. 6a–b). The origin of the cell membranes significantly influences the function of BNPs. Common sources include red blood cells, immune cells, macrophages, and tumor cells [113,114]. Currently, EV-based nanoparticles are more commonly used in local nucleic acid drug delivery. Extracellular vesicles, which are secreted by cells to mediate intercellular communication, include apoptotic vesicles, microvesicles, and exosomes. Among these, exosomes are the most extensively studied for drug delivery. Exosomes are vesicles ranging from 30 to 150 nm in size, with a lipid bilayer structure that contains various biologically active substances. Self-derived exosomes can reduce immune rejection in patients, making them highly promising for clinical applications. The primary advantage of exosomes is their ability to be modified exogenously (e.g. via electroporation, acoustic treatment, or freeze-thaw cycles) or endogenously (e.g. via plasmid transfection). These modifications enable exosomes to express specific proteins or miRNAs, achieving targeted delivery, trophoblast effects, or immunomodulation. The source of exosomes strongly influences their properties and functions [[115], [116], [117]]. For example, exosomes secreted by stem cells and immune cells exhibit neurotrophic and immunomodulatory functions [118]. Exosomes are typically extracted using ultracentrifugation, precipitation, ultrafiltration, and affinity chromatography. These methods are often combined to ensure the purity of the exosomes [119]. Initial purification is commonly performed via centrifugation, followed by further purification using chromatography and/or precipitation. Exosomes are identified through transmission electron microscopy, size analysis, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and protein marker analysis.Fig. 6Scheme of BNPs used for nucleic acid drug delivery. a) Exosome membrane encapsulate PNP complex. b) Exosome membrane encapsulate INP. c) Exosome-liposome hybrid nanoparticle.Fig. 6",

        "Compared to LNPs, exosomes may synergize with nucleic acid drugs to enhance immunomodulation and therapeutic effects. For lung cancer inhaled gene therapy, Cheng et al. used human embryonic kidney cell-derived exosomes to load mRNA encoding interleukin-12 (IL-12) via electroporation [120]. When compared with LNPs of similar functionality, exosomes demonstrated superior lung enrichment, despite both being administered through inhalation. In addition, exosomes further enhanced protective immune responses, relying on CD8+ T cells. Fusing LNPs with biomembranes or combining biomembranes from different sources to create hybrid nucleic acid drug delivery systems is a popular research direction (Fig. 6c) [121,122]. However, challenges such as the difficulty and instability of large-scale extraction of cell membranes or exosomes for clinical applications must be addressed. Furthermore, the lack of standardized international protocols for biomimetic membrane extraction limits their broader application.",
        "INPs can be categorized into metallic and non-metallic nanoparticles. INPs possess a high specific surface area, facilitating surface functionalization and modification. Metallic nanoparticles exhibit unique optical, thermal, and magnetic properties, enabling their use for combined diagnosis and therapy [123]. Common metallic nanoparticles include gold nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles, and zinc oxide nanoparticles [124,125]. Non-metallic nanoparticles mainly comprise carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, and silicon dioxide nanoparticles [126,127]. Based on current research, INPs load nucleic acid drugs mainly through three mechanisms: 1) Cationic molecules modified on the surface of INPs. This makes the whole nanoparticles being positively charged, allowing for electrostatic adsorption of nucleic acid drugs [128]. 2) Nucleic acid drugs are modified on the surface of INPs via linkers responsive to specific biological environments [129]. 3) INPs are coated with amphiphilic cationic polymers through self-assembly. Nucleic acid drugs are electrostatically adsorbed by the overall positive electrical properties of the complexes [130].",
        "One significant advantage of INPs is their ability to synergize directly or indirectly with nucleic acid drugs to enhance therapeutic effects. For instance, Liechty et al. utilized cerium dioxide nanoparticles coupled with miR-146a to treat acute lung injury via intratracheal injection [131]. Cerium dioxide nanoparticles scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS), while miR-146a reduced leukocyte recruitment and the inflammatory response. This combination was more effective than either cerium dioxide nanoparticles or miR-146a alone.",
        "INPs can also stimulate photothermal effects to enhance drug therapy. Cui et al. constructed a gold nanocage siRNA-DOX synergistic therapeutic delivery system [132]. siRNA and thiolated DNA were modified on the surface of Au NPs to form the inner cores, which were then wrapped in single-stranded DNA to create DNA nanocages. The chemotherapeutic drug DOX was inserted into the DNA double strands. Administered via local injection to the lungs, the nanocages significantly improved survival in lung cancer models through gene-chem-photothermal triple therapy.",
        "In addition to therapeutic applications, INPs can act as contrast agents for medical diagnostics. Their use in medical imaging can guide drug delivery, helping to select optimal delivery systems and informing subsequent therapeutic regimens. Zhang et al. stabilized gold nanoparticles with ichthyosin sulfate to deliver pDNA encoding hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (Fig. 7a) [133]. The nanoparticles were initially taken up by MSCs, which were then injected into the lungs of IPF mice via the airway. Enhanced CT imaging allowed real-time monitoring of lung conditions for up to 48 days. Accurate imaging of neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation in the brain remains a challenge. To address this, Zhang's group constructed a zwitterion-based amphiphilic polymer, poly(carboxybetaine) based poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-retinoic acid-poly(carboxybetaine) cell-penetrating peptide (PHEMA-RA-PCB-CPP), to encapsulate SPIONs and adsorb siRNA targeting sex determining region Y box protein 9 (SOX9), named PHEMA-RA-PCB-CPP/SPIONs/siSOX9 NPs (Fig. 7b) [106]. These nanoparticles were endocytosed by the NSCs, which were then locally injected into the brains of Alzheimer's disease mouse models. The migration of NSCs in the mouse brain was successfully tracked in real-time using MRI.Fig. 7Representative INPs for nucleic acid drug delivery. a) Gold nanoparticle-based pDNA delivery vectors labeled hMCSs were transplanted in an IPF model mouse for CT tracking [133].

        "However, the slow metabolism and biosafety of INPs must be carefully considered for inhalation drug delivery. For example, inhalation of large quantities of micron-sized SiO2 particles in the lungs can trigger fibrosis. Yao et al. reported that SiO2 dust inhalation in mice elevated levels of macrophage exosome miR-107, leading to cell cycle arrest and differentiation of lung fibroblasts [134].",
        "DNA origami is commonly composed of a long single strand DNA scaffold (phage M13 bacteriophage DNA) and numerous short DNA pieces (named staple strands) that are assembled through nucleic acid sequence hybridization based on the Watson-Crick base pairing principle. It was first proposed by Paul W. K. Rothemund in 2006 [135]. He used many short single-stranded DNA pieces to assemble different 2D shapes by “one-pot” method. In 2009, 3D and curved space DNA origami were developed to expand its scope of utilization [136,137]. Due to its precise control over morphology, flexible shape design, and ease of functional modification, DNA origami can be versatilely prepared to encapsulate chemical drugs, proteins, nucleic acid drugs, and metal nanoparticles [138,139]. The application of DNA origami technology is not limited to this, as it also holds great potential in the fields of nano-chips, nucleic acid detection, and virus detection.",
        "Nanomaterials based on DNA origami technology have been reported to have favorable biosafety and nucleic acid delivery capabilities. Daniel G. Anderson et al. used six single-stranded DNA fragments and six siRNAs to form tetrahedral nanoparticles loaded with siRNAs by self-assembly [140]. They also precisely modified folate ligands on these tetrahedral nanoparticles to achieve efficient delivery of siRNA at the tumor site without causing any immune response. DNA origami-based nanomaterials can also be designed as microenvironment-responsive nucleic acid delivery systems. Ding et al. constructed a 3D tube-shaped glutathione-responsive nanodevice [141]. As shown in Fig. 8a, they prepared a DNA nanostructure to load doxorubicin (through DNA intercalation) and siRNAs targeting Bcl-2 and P-gp. The outer layer was modified by tumor-targeting peptides. Importantly, the single stranded-DNA containing S-S bonds acts as a locking chain to close this tubular structure. Once in the tumor's glutathione environment, the S-S bonds would be cleaved to release siRNAs and DOX. For local lung delivery, Ding's group utilized a negatively charged, hydrophilic DNA origami nano-delivery system modified with the cell-penetrating peptide R9 (RRRRRRRRR) to enhance the bio-barrier permeation in the lungs (Fig. 8b) [142]. In a lipopolysaccharides-induced acute lung injury model, the delivery system successfully reached deep lung lesions and demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects.Fig. 8Representative nanomaterials based on DNA origami technology for nucleic acid drug delivery. a) Scheme of glutathione-responsive opened tubular DNA nanodevice [141].

        "Nucleic acid drugs have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for treating various diseases. However, their application in extrahepatic disease therapy is limited due to challenges such as poor targeting ability, susceptibility to nuclease degradation, and negative electronegativity. In addition to the appropriate delivery techniques, the approach of administration is critical for achieving effective extrahepatic delivery of nucleic acid drugs. Local delivery of nucleic acid drugs is currently one of the most important modalities for extrahepatic disease therapy. Organs suitable for localized delivery are typically those where drug administration can be achieved through non-invasive or acceptably invasive methods, such as the lungs, brains, eyes, skin, joints, and heart. Nevertheless, each organ presents unique biological barriers and delivery challenges [143], requiring the development of tailored delivery strategies based on the specific characteristics of the target disease. In this section, we described the bio-barriers, administration approaches, and research advances in the delivery of nucleic acid drugs to the lungs, brain, eyes, skin, joints, and heart.",
        "The abundance of capillaries, the large surface area of the alveoli, and the short transit distance between epithelial cells and blood vessels make the local delivery of nucleic acid drugs particularly suitable for lung disease therapy [144]. The phase I clinical trial of the inhaled Ad5-nCoV vaccine (NCT04552366) reported that inhaling one-fifth of the intramuscular dose produced comparable antibody titers while significantly reducing the incidence of adverse effects [145], proving the superiority of local drug delivery.",
        "However, even with direct administration into the lungs, drugs still face barriers in the lower airways and alveoli (Fig. 9a). The first barrier is the mucus layer, which has a dense reticular structure. Drugs delivered locally to the lungs are initially trapped in the mucus layer and subsequently cleared by the periciliary layer. Epithelial and endothelial cells constitute cellular barriers that drugs must penetrate to reach target cells-one of the major challenges in nucleic acid drug delivery. Furthermore, the alveolar barrier, including the collagen matrix, significantly affects drug utilization [146]. Therefore, the nucleic acid drug delivery system must be capable of overcoming these biological barriers to effectively reach and enter target cells.Fig. 9Physiologic structure and representative nucleic acid therapeutics for the lungs. a) The physiologic structure of the lung. b) Preparation and mechanism of CAS-LNP [81].

        "Apart from physiological barriers, the mechanical shear generated by the nebulizer may also compromise the integrity of the nanoparticles [148]. During the nebulization process, shear stress exerts pressure on the nanoparticles, causing them to rupture. This results in premature exposure of the nucleic acid drug to the nuclease environment, leading to degradation. For example, Lu's team used a vibrating mesh sprayer (Aerogen Solo) to nebulize SM102-LNP. They revealed that the structure of the SM102-LNP was severely disrupted after nebulization, with only ∼17 % of intact LNP remaining [81]. Therefore, nucleic acid drug delivery systems for intravenous delivery and nebulized inhalation are not identical in design principles. Gaurav Sahay et al. developed a microfluidic nebulization platform that effectively maintained the integrity of LNPs and mRNA stability after nebulization [149]. In addition, the atomizer and mesh pore size also influence the integrity of the nanoparticles. Vibrating mesh nebulizers are gentler on nanoparticles than ultrasonic nebulizers and air-jet nebulizers [150,151]. Larger mesh apertures can minimize the damage to nanoparticles.",
        "The main methods of local administration to the lungs include inhalation, nasal administration, and intratracheal injection. Among these, inhalation is a favored and straightforward method for delivering drugs locally to the lungs. This approach requires devices such as nebulized inhalers or dry powder inhalers for precise and effective delivery. Particles smaller than 10 μm (referred to as “respirable particles”) can be inhaled into the lungs [152]. Particles larger than 5 μm tend to accumulate in the upper respiratory tract, while particles ranging from 1 to 5 μm primarily deposit in the lower respiratory tract. Particles smaller than 1 μm are more likely to reach the alveoli but are also prone to exhalation [153]. Nasal administration differs from airway inhalation in terms of particle size and delivery mechanism. Particles ranging from 10 to 150 μm are generally more likely to be deposited in the nasal cavity. Besides, nasal drug delivery requires minimal dispersion of particles. For instance, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals employed 2′-O-hexadecyl (C16) conjugate with siRNAs to realize a long-lasting reduction of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mRNA in the lungs by intranasal administration. Intratracheal injection involves the direct insertion of drugs into the airways, followed by pressurized breathing to facilitate drug diffusion and absorption in the lungs. Compared to inhalation and nasal administration, intratracheal injection requires specialized physicians and equipment, leading to lower patient compliance.",
        "For clinical trials of local nucleic acid therapeutics for lung, Moderna Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals have co-developed an LNP-based delivery system (VX-522) for cystic fibrosis therapy via inhalation [154]. VX-522 delivers mRNA targeting the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and is currently in Phase I clinical trials (NCT05668741). Arcturus Therapeutics also developed mRNA-LNP (ARCT-032) targeting CFTR to treat CF (NCT06747858/NCT05712538) [155,156]. Phase I/II clinical data showed that ARCT-032 did not cause any adverse effects in the participants and showed a trend toward improved lung function after two doses. Additionally, ReCode Therapeutics launched mRNA-encapsulated LNPs-based on selective organ targeting (SORT) platform for the treatment of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) via aerosol inhalation (named RCT1100, NCT05737485/NCT06600425/NCT06633757) [157,158]. The results showed that in Phase Ia trial RCT1100 had a safety profile in 40 healthy adult volunteers. It is being conducted in Phase Ib trial to evaluate safety and tolerability for PCP patients. Subsequently, they developed the second aerosol inhaled mRNA-LNP (named RCT2100) based on the SORT platform to treat CF [159]. It is currently recruiting volunteers to conduct safety evaluations (NCT06237335).",
        "The mucus barrier is a major obstacle for inhaled nucleic acid therapeutics. PEG modification provides a promising strategy [160]. James E. Dahlman's group investigated the mechanism of PEG lipids for the mRNA delivery of nebulized LNPs to the lungs [161]. In LNPs containing cationic lipids (DOTAP, DOTMA, DDAB), increasing the content of PEG lipids enhanced mRNA transfection efficiency in vivo. In contrast, in LNPs containing neutral lipids (DOPE, DSPC), increasing the PEG content decreased the transfection efficiency of mRNA, but lengthening the PEG lipid tails could increase the transfection efficiency. Similarly, Zhang's team developed a cationic lipid delivery system loaded with siIL-11 and modified with PLGA-PEG on the outer layer, which significantly enhanced the mucus barrier penetration of the particles [104]. After inhalation, this system efficiently inhibited fibroblast differentiation and reduced collagen deposition in mice, leading to substantial improvement in pulmonary fibrosis. Using lung tissue surface components as drug vector coatings has also been reported to enhance mucus permeability [162,163]. Jiang et al. incorporated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), a key phospholipid in pulmonary surfactants, with ionizable lipid molecules to construct an mRNA delivery system [77]. The inclusion of DPPC improved mRNA permeability through biological barriers and facilitated pulmonary fibrosis treatment.",
        "Regulating the charge and hydrophilicity of the delivery systems may also enhance bio-barrier permeability of nucleic acid drugs. Hydrophilic delivery systems with neutral or negative charges are generally more effective at penetrating bio-barriers. Lu's group developed a charge-assisted stabilization (CAS) strategy-based mRNA LNP (short as CAS-LNP, Fig. 9b) [81]. They designed a peptide (DSSC, aspartic acid provided negative charges, serine enhanced hydrophilicity) to link with DOPE. When the LNP composition was 50 % SM-102, 7.5 % DSPC, 38.5 % cholesterol, 1.5 % DMG-PEG, and 2.5 % DSSC-DOPE, the zeta potential of CAS-LNP was ∼-12 mV, showing more than 35 % of intact LNP after nebulization, while the SM-102-LNP (zeta potential: 2.39 mV) showed only ∼17 %. Moreover, 2.5 % CAS-LNP also showed higher mRNA transfection efficiency than SM-102-LNP after nebulized inhalation.",
        "Targeted delivery to specific cells in lung is also critical. Small molecules or peptides with targeting functions are often incorporated into nucleic acid drug delivery systems to enhance specificity. Many cell surfaces in the target area overexpress glucose-associated receptors, allowing specific glucose modifications to facilitate target cell uptake of nucleic acid drugs. Engelhardt et al. identified overexpression of mannose receptor 1 (Mrc1) on the surface of alveolar macrophages in SARS-CoV-2 patients [164]. They used computer simulations to identify trimannose suitable for Mrc1 binding and conjugated it with locked nucleic acid to inhibit miR-21, which is highly expressed at inflammation sites. In a lung injury mouse model, the conjugates effectively targeted alveolar macrophages and reduced miR-21 expression through airway administration. For lung cancer therapy, Cui et al. constructed a gold nanocage siRNA delivery system [132]. The outer layers were wrapped by an aptamer AS1411, which binds to the nucleolin receptor overexpressed on tumor cells. The modification of AS1411 significantly enhanced nanoparticle retention after inhalation into the lungs.",
        "BNPs, with homologous targeting ability, demonstrate potential for penetrating biological barriers and targeting lung tissues. Anastasiya et al. used exosomes derived from MSCs for inhalation administration in a lung fibrosis model mice [165]. The endogenous miR-29c and miR-129 in the exosomes significantly reduced actin expression in myofibroblasts. Bacterial outer membranes have been reported to possess the property of fusing with homologous bacteria [166]. As shown in Fig. 9c, Jin's group constructed bionic vesicles loaded with CRISPR/Cas9 pDNA utilizing a mixture of bacterial membrane derivatives and cationic lipids [147]. The results showed that inhalation of hybrid bionic vesicles alleviated lung infections, reduced lung inflammation, and promoted recovery of respiratory and locomotor functions in multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) mice.

        "Summary of local nucleic acid therapeutics for lung.",
        "The physiological structure and biological barriers of brain tissues were shown in Fig. 10a. Blood brain barrier (BBB) is the main brain barrier that prevents the delivery of nucleic acid drugs, which consists of the endothelial cells, basal lamina, astrocytes, pericytes, and microvascular smooth muscle cells [168]. In particular, the core component of the BBB is the endothelial cells of brain capillaries. The blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier includes choroid plexus, tight junctions, and endothelial cells, which impede the passage of substances from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid. Additionally, the arachnoid barrier involves the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia matter. For transnasal delivery into the brain, drugs may leak into the brain and cerebrospinal fluid through nasal epithelial cells or be transported through transneuronal pathways via olfactory and trigeminal axons. However, the nose-brain barrier remains a challenge, requiring nucleic acid drug delivery vectors to penetrate the intranasal mucus and the layers of olfactory epithelial cells to reach brain lesions. These barriers help maintain the homeostatic environment of the ventricles while severely preventing the enrichment of nucleic acid drugs in brain lesions through systemic administration.Fig. 10Physiologic structure and representative nucleic acid therapeutics for the brains. a)The physiologic structure of the brain.

        "Some researchers have attempted to enable nucleic acid drugs to penetrate the BBB through intra-cerebroventricular and intrathecal injection. Although local injection into the brain is invasive, a single injection can maintain a high concentration of the drug, thereby avoiding delays in achieving optimal treatment due to the difficulty of delivering the drug to the brain. Intra-cerebroventricular injection involves injecting nucleic acid drugs directly into the ventricles of the brain through the skull, allowing the drugs to be delivered directly to the brain and bypass the BBB limitations [169]. However, this approach is invasive and may result in increased intracranial pressure, which in turn creates potential risks such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage, intracranial infections, and neurological deficits. Intrathecal injection is performed by lumbar puncture or by implanting a drug delivery device in the intrathecal space or subarachnoid space. Drugs can diffuse into the brain parenchyma through the cerebrospinal fluid flow. Compared to intra-cerebroventricular injection, intrathecal injection is less invasive. But it still poses a risk of medullary damage. Intranasal administration is also recognized as a potential method for delivering drugs to the brain. Unlike the above injections, intranasal administration is non-invasive. Given the presence of the nose-brain barrier, when designing a nucleic acid drug delivery system for transnasal administration, the penetration of the delivery system into mucus and endothelial cells must be carefully considered.",
        "Intrathecal administration is the most widely used approach in both clinical and preclinical nucleic acid therapeutics for brain diseases. For instance, Nusinersen (Spinraza), an FDA-approved ASO drug for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (NCT04591678), is primarily administered intrathecally to enable ASO to bind to survivor motor neuron (SMN) pre-mRNA, thereby promoting exon 7 inclusion in SMN2 and enhancing SMN protein expression [18]. Qalsody (Tofersen) was approved for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene by intrathecal administration (NCT04972487) [170]. Tominersen, an ASO drug used to treat Huntington's (HTT) disease by intrathecal injection, has shown good patient tolerance and significant reduction of HTT proteins in cerebrospinal fluid in current clinical trials (NCT05686551/NCT04000594/NCT03842969) [171]. To screen for siRNA delivery technologies suitable for the brain, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals employed C16 conjugated with siRNAs to achieve sustained localized RNA interference activity for more than 3 months through intrathecal and lateral ventricular local administration [65]. This study is currently in a phase I clinical trial (NCT05231785).",
        "For intra-cerebroventricular administration, Hanseul Park et al. developed a cationic micelle by self-assembly of an amphiphilic peptide R7L10 (NH2-RRRRRRRRLLLLLLLLLL-COOH). The cationic micelle electrostatically adsorbed CRISPR/Cas9 RNP targeting Beta-Secretase 1 (BACE1) to form a nanocomplex [172]. They delivered the nanocomplex to the CA3 region of the hippocampus in the mouse brain to knock down BACE1 gene. The results showed that the nanocomplex successfully edited the BACE1 gene without causing off-target mutations in brain neurons. Then, it significantly attenuated the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ42 plaques, ultimately facilitated the cognitive enhancement in AD mice. This represents the first use of non-viral CRISPR RNP vectors for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",
        "Poly(β-amino ester) (PBAE) nanoparticles, which have a favorable biosafety profile and good buffer capacity, have been extensively studied in localized nucleic acid drug delivery in the brain [173]. Jordan J. Green and colleagues synthesized a series of PBAE molecules to load miRNAs [108]. By evaluating binding ability to miRNAs, proton buffering capacity, cellular uptake, and gene expression capacity, they screened a PBAE molecule (named BR6-S4-E6) prepared by monomer 2,2′-disulfanediylbis(ethane-2,1-diyl)diacrylate (BR6) co-polymerized with 4-amino-1-butanol (S4) via a Michael addition reaction, and end-capped with 2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethanol (E6) (Fig. 10b). BR6-S4-E6 could form a complex with miR-148a and miR-296-5p via electrostatic adsorption, significantly prolonging the survival time of glioma mice after intra-cerebroventricular administration. Subsequently, this group developed a carboxylated branched PBAE for CRISPR/Cas9 RNP delivery [109]. Efficient gene editing in glioma mice was achieved by a single intracranial injection of this PBAE/CRISPR RNP nanocomplex. Jung Soo Suk et al. conjugated PBAE with 5 kD PEG to minimize adhesive trapping in the brain [174]. In comparison with conventional PBAE/pDNA nanocomplexes, PBAE-PEG promoted the diffuse distribution of pDNA in the brain. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa et al. also developed PBAE molecule to load pDNA targeting bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) for brain tumor therapy through intranasal administration [175].",
        "BNPs have also demonstrated potential in local nucleic acid therapeutics for brain diseases. Tao and co-workers used RNA-seq to analyze and screen a miRNA, miR-26a-5p, which is highly conserved in human placental mesenchymal stem cells. They found that miR-26a-5p persistently reversed neuroinflammation and mechanical abnormal pain in mice through a single injection by regulating the Wnt5a pathway [175]. In order to enhance the nose-brain barrier penetration ability of transnasally administered nucleic acid drugs, peptides with penetration ability can be modified. Zhang et al. treated Parkinson's disease (PD) by modifying exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells with an osmotic peptide (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK, P) (Fig. 10c) [100]. Through intranasal administration, the exosomes released encapsulated curcumin to brain lesions and synergize with exosomal endogenous miR-133b. To efficiently load siRNA targeting Huntingtin (HTT) into exosomes, Anastasia Khvorova's group used hydrophobic cholesterol conjugated with the 3′ end of the siRNA passenger strand [176]. Cholesterol, as one of the main components of exosome membranes, can be fused into exosomes to realize siRNA loading without changing the structure of exosomes. The results showed that insertion of siHTT into glioma cell-derived exosomes significantly down-regulated HTT protein through brain-localized administration. Similarly, Lee et al. engineered the binding receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE, over-expressed in hypoxic cells of the ischemic brain) peptide (RBP) to be carried in exosomes [177]. In addition, ASOs targeting miR-181a were modified by cholesterol and inserted on RBP engineered modified exosomes through hydrophobic interactions. Through intranasal delivery, the modified exosomes achieved neuroprotection in an ischemic stroke rat model.

        "The structure of the eyes can be divided into anterior (including: cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens) and posterior (including: retina, vitreous, fovea, choroid, sclera) segments (Fig. 11a). The eyes are one of the most suitable organs for local drug delivery, as they are independent of the systemic immune system. However, the complex and tightly interconnected tissue structure of the eye significantly limits the application of nucleic acid drug delivery. First of all, tear dilution causes more than 85 % of the drugs to be lost [184]. The remaining drugs must also overcome barriers such as the corneal barrier, vitreous barrier, and the blood-retinal barrier [185]. The corneal barrier consists of epithelium, bowman's layer, stroma, and endothelium. The tight connectivity between corneal epithelial cells and lipid-enriched cell membranes prevents the penetration of hydrophilic drugs. The vitreous humor is a clear, gel-like substance that has a low blood flow, so the diffusion of drugs through the vitreous humor is very slow. The blood-retinal barrier is formed by tight junctions between retinal ganglion cells, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and photoreceptors. Intraocular drug delivery sites mainly include the anterior chamber, vitreous, retina, sclera, choroid, and cornea [186]. Among these, the cornea and retina are the main target sites for nucleic acid drug delivery [187]. The tight junctions and hydrophobic structures of corneal and retinal epithelial cells hinder the diffusion of hydrophilic drugs.Fig. 11Physiologic structure and representative nucleic acid therapeutics for the eyes. a)The physiologic structure of the eye. b) Scheme of MH42 peptide-guided LNPs for mRNA delivery through intravitreal and subretinal administration [83].

        "The major methods for ocular topical delivery of nucleic acid drugs include ocular surface drops and injections. Ocular surface drops, which are suitable for treating ocular surface diseases, are available in the form of eye drops, adhesive ointments, and gels. Among these, eye drops are highly comfortable for patients but are easily diluted by tears, resulting in low effective concentrations. Ointments and gels can extend the retention time of the drug in the eye but are associated with lower patient compliance [188]. Ocular injections and intraocular implants may be more effective for treatments requiring higher drug concentrations or for deeper eye diseases. Drugs can be administered retinally, intraocularly, subconjunctivally, periocularly, and intravitreally. Nucleic acid drugs delivered intraocularly diffuse rapidly into areas such as the retina and choroid plexus. Direct injections bypass the corneal barriers and significantly increase the local concentrations of the drugs. However, they are invasive and may cause complications and other risks.",
        "In clinical trials of local nucleic acid therapeutics for eyes, Vitravene (Fomivirsen), developed by Ionis and Novartis, utilized phosphoskeletal thio-modified ASOs. By vitreous administration, Fomivirsen downregulated the Immediate-early 2 (IE-2) gene and was used to treat retinitis caused by CMV infection in HIV patients [17]. Unfortunately, it was withdrawn from the market due to low demand. Aptamers are also widely used in ocular topical delivery. Pegaptanib is a PEG-linked nucleic acid aptamer drug that inhibits endothelial cell proliferation by inhibiting VEGF for AMD therapy via intravitreal injection [31]. However, it was withdrawn from the market in 2006 due to the limited economic benefits it generated. Avacincaptad pegol, an RNA aptamer that covalently binds to branched PEG molecules, specifically inhibits complement protein C5, reducing inflammation-associated retinal pigment epithelial damage [32]. Approved by the U.S. FDA in August 2023, it is administered via intravitreal injection for the treatment of AMD.",
        "In preclinical trials, Tivanisiran is an eye drop for the treatment of Sjögren's Syndrome [189]. It inhibits the synthesis of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) via siRNA, thereby alleviating pain and inflammation. Tivanisiran is currently in a Phase III clinical trial (NCT04819269) and has shown good tolerability. OLX10212, an asymmetric siRNA developed by OliX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., targets the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and is administered via intravitreal injection for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration [190]. OLX10212 is currently being evaluated for safety and tolerability (NCT05643118). Hong and colleagues used sugar-engineered nanoparticles to load ASO targeting the mRNA of Ec108acpP (named GP-SiNPs-asPNA) as eye drops to treat bacterial keratitis. GP-SiNPs-asPNA could be internalized into bacterial cells through the bacteria-specific ABC sugar transporter pathway [191]. This delivery system eradicated nearly 100 % of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and is currently in a clinical phase I trial (NCT06451172).",
        "Lipophilic drugs are more effective in penetrating the corneal barrier. Yossi Mandel's group constructed aptamer-modified C-dots nanocompsosites for the treatment of ocular vascular diseases [192]. Due to the hydrophobic property of the C-dots, the nanocompsosite could penetrate into the corneal epithelium rapidly after topical administration. After penetrating the corneal epithelium, hydrophilic Apts traverse the deeper hydrophilic corneal stroma, then into the lens, and ultimately into the retina and posterior sclera.",
        "Exosomes have also been reported to possess the advantage of penetrating the blood-eye barrier. Chi et al. found the level miR-29s in the aqueous humor of the glaucoma patients’ eyes was significantly higher than that of the normal group [193]. They prepared engineered exosomes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, which efficiently expressing miR-29b-3p to interfere miR-29s. These engineered exosomes were injected intraocularly into the retinal tissue of mice, thereby promoting optic nerve repair. To enhance retention of nucleic acid drugs in ocular lesions, Bajpayee et al. inserted arginine-rich cationic lipid molecules on the surface of milk-derived exosomes to deliver mRNA [194]. These modifications allowed the exosomes to interact with anionic glycosaminoglycan and the water content of the tissue via electrostatic interactions. Arginine-modified exosomes demonstrated superior penetration through the full thickness of porcine retinal explants and enhanced mRNA transfection efficiency.",
        "Surface modification of delivery systems by targeted peptides, aptamers, and functional groups can facilitate the targeting and retention of nucleic acid drugs in target cells. As shown in Fig. 11b, Gaurav Sahay's group screened the peptide SPALHFLGGGGSC (MH42) for its high affinity for retinal photoreceptor cells using a combined M13 phage-based heptameric peptide phage display library [83]. Through intravitreal and subretinal injection, they found that the MH42 peptide (0.15 %) modified on the surface of LNPs could efficiently deliver mRNAs into retinal cells of mice and rhesus monkeys, providing an efficient ocular mRNA delivery LNPs. After that, this group explored the retinal transfection effects of different functional groups on the LNPs. They prepared LNPs containing DSPE-PEG-Amine (providing positive charges), DSPE-PEG-Carboxy NHS, and DSPE-PEG-Carboxylic Acid (providing negative charges), respectively (Fig. 11c) [84]. After subretinal injection, the results showed that LNPs containing DSPE-PEG-Carboxylic Acid and DSPE-PEG-Carboxy NHS were effective in facilitating mRNA photoreceptor transfection. They hypothesized that LNPs with carboxylated surface modifications have modified protein crowns that contribute to the ability of mRNA to enter the photoreceptors. Mucin 1, a glycoprotein highly expressed in the cornea, was also targeted for drug retention. To prolong the retention time of the drug in the cornea, Liu's group ligated the Mucin 1 aptamer to cholesterol and inserted it into liposomes to prepare eye drops for the treatment of dry eye [79].",
        "For corneal administration, Solinis et al. used lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) to encapsulate mRNA encoding Interleukin-10 (IL-10) [70]. They formulated the LNPs into eye drops containing 1 % polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Following eye drop administration, IL-10 mRNA was successfully expressed in the corneal epithelium of mice, demonstrating that the IL-10 production promoted by the drops could alleviate corneal inflammation in mice.",
        "For deeper ocular delivery, Campochiaro's team utilized cationic poly(-amino ester)s (PBAEs) to deliver pDNA encoding VEGF-neutralizing protein [107]. VEGF protein expression was sustained for more than eight months with choroidal and subretinal injections. This approach significantly inhibited vascular leakage and neovascularization in a macular degeneration rat model. Additionally, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals employed C16-conjugated siRNA to achieve sustained down-regulation of transthyretin protein for six months through topical ocular vitreous administration [65].

        "The skin is the largest organ in the body. Transdermal administration is not only convenient but also facilitates the observation of the skin's response to the treatment. However, transdermal drug delivery faces the physiological barriers, including the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale, which hinder the absorption of nucleic acid drugs (Fig. 12a) [197]. Among these, the stratum corneum represents the largest barrier to transdermal drug delivery. It consists of tightly packed cells with a thickness of 10–20 μm. From the superficial layers to deeper ones, drug delivery must overcome the barriers of the granulosum layer, the stratum spinosum, and the stratum basale before reaching the dermis [198]. The dermis itself comprises the papillary and reticular layers, which contain connective tissue and microvessels. Beneath the dermis lies the hypodermis, primarily composed of fat and connective tissue, which serves as an energy store and provides cushioning protection.Fig. 12Physiologic structure and representative nucleic acid therapeutics for the skin. a)The physiologic structure of the skin. b) Preparation and mechanism of EVs@DALC for wound healing [199].

        "Transdermal administration is the simplest and most convenient method for delivering drugs to the surface of the skin. Nucleic acid drugs can be applied to the skin through various dosage forms such as liquids, ointments, and patches. Many innovative transdermal patches and wearable devices have been developed to facilitate drug release and real-time monitoring [200,201]. However, pure transdermal delivery often penetrates the skin barrier with limited efficiency.",
        "Intradermal and subcutaneous injections are direct methods for bypassing the stratum corneum barrier. Microneedles are an effective solution for delivering drugs uniformly across a fixed area of skin. Typically, microneedles have lengths ranging from 150 to 1500 μm. Their sharp tips can directly penetrate the stratum corneum, allowing nucleic acid drugs to reach the dermis [202]. Besides, microneedles are less invasive, and the wounds can heal quickly. However, compared to traditional subcutaneous injections, the dosage of drugs administered using microneedles is difficult to control, and the procedure is more costly.",
        "It can also be used to enhance the transdermal delivery efficiency of nucleic acid drugs by incorporating physical modalities such as electroporation, topical ultrasound, iontophoresis, lasers, and so on. However, It is important to consider whether the nucleic acid drug delivery system and the nucleic acid drug maintain their integrity after being stimulated by these physical methods [203].",
        "For preclinical research, TD101 is the first siRNA trial in human skin for pachyonychia congenita therapy (NCT00716014) [204]. The results of phase I clinical trial showed non-adverse effects in patients receiving TD101. And the callus regression was observed in the foot. Vaccines are usually administered intramuscularly, but since the dermis also contains a rich blood and lymphatic system, dermal injections can achieve effective immunization. Moreover, microneedle patches can produce an immune response at low doses due to their ability to cover a larger surface of the skin. For this reason, the Leiden University Medical Center initiated the intradermal delivery of mRNA vaccines encoding Spike proteins in microneedle patches to treat SARS-CoV-2 [82]. Phase I clinical trials are currently being conducted to evaluate immunogenicity and safety (NCT05315362).",
        "Certain peptides and molecules have been reported to enhance skin barrier penetration. Peng et al. designed a tumor-targeting molecule by modifying polyamide ester (PEA) with hyaluronic acid (HA) and a skin-permeable peptide (SCP, ACTGSTQHQCG) [111]. SCP-HA-PAE formed micelles by self-assembly to adsorb siRNAs targeting survivin, enabling transdermal delivery for melanoma treatment. Similarly, Yasuo Seta et al. enhanced the transdermal penetration of free siRNA by pretreating the skin with a functional stearylated cytoplasm-responsive peptide (stearic acid CHHRRRRHHC) and a tight junction-opening peptide (FCIGRLCG) [205]. For transdermal administration, Song et al. constructed hyaluronic acid nanoparticles conjugated with ASO targeting the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) gene, loaded with DOX for transdermal treatment of proliferative scarring in mice [206]. The nanoparticles enhanced skin penetration through the intercellular pathway, achieving a penetration intensity 1.7 times higher than that of free drugs. This approach significantly inhibited the growth of proliferative scarring in mice through synergistic gene-chemotherapy effects. For intradermal administration, Harris et al. utilized docosanoic acid conjugated with siRNAs for gene therapy targeting autoimmune skin diseases. They screened siRNA targeting JAK1 and verified the immunomodulatory function of the docosanoic acid conjugated siJAK1 [207]. The results showed that local administration of docosanoic acid conjugated siJAK1 significantly reduced skin infiltration of autoreactive CD8+ T cells and prevented epidermal depigmentation. In addition, a single injection maintained the effect in mouse skin for up to five weeks. Yasuo Seta combined siRNA with a peptide AT1002 (capable of opening skin tight junctions), and a peptide STR-CH2R4H2C (cytoplasmic-responsive arginine-rich peptide) to achieve an ameliorative effect of siRNA on atopic dermatitis through transdermal delivery [208].",
        "The permeability barrier of the stratum corneum comprises lipids such as ceramides and cholesterol. Lipid-based nucleic acid drug delivery systems, therefore, have the potential to penetrate this physiological barrier. As shown in Fig. 12b, Zhang et al. synthesized a lipid molecule by linking 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid to dioleostearin-3-amino-1,2-propanediol, named DA [199]. Liquid crystals prepared from DA (DALC) were fused with extracellular vesicles derived from adipose mesenchymal stem cells (AMSC) to create EVs@DALC. This system was applied to the treatment of skin trauma. The lipophilicity of EVs@DALC facilitated transport through the epidermal layer and significantly enhanced cellular uptake of miR-31 and miR-126, reducing ROS and cellular inflammation.",
        "Topical ultrasound can also facilitate deep penetration of the nucleic acid drug delivery system at the administration sites. Yoon et al. designed microbubble (MB)-nanoliposome (NL) nanoparticles loaded with Cas9/sgRNA RNP, named MB-NL(Cas9/sgRNA) (Fig. 12c) [78]. Under local ultrasound, the CRISPR RNP was efficiently taken up by dermal papilla cells in androgenetic alopecia model mice, successfully suppressing the expression of the key SRD5A2 gene responsible for alopecia. This treatment restored hair growth in the mice.",
        "Iontophoresis is another effective method to enhance drug penetration through biological barrier. It mainly delivers drugs transdermally via electro-osmosis and electro-repulsion. Kogure et al. utilized the functional peptide AT1002 (RRRGGFCIGRL) combined with iontophoresis to open the thickened skin barriers caused by psoriasis [209]. ASOs were then delivered to the dermis, where inflammation occurred, inhibiting the expression of relevant inflammatory factors and improving epidermal proliferation in psoriasis model rats.",
        "In order to deliver pDNA to the dermis utilizing microneedles, Khademhosseini et al. constructed a gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-based microneedle platform for pDNA delivery [210]. The pDNA was encapsulated in poly (β-amino ester) (PBAE) and subsequently loaded into the microneedle. This method enabled the efficient release and expression of pDNA in the dermis through microneedle administration.",
        "Ionic liquids are a class of liquid salts composed of organic cations and anions, which can deliver nucleic acid drugs through non-covalent complexation. The ionic interactions help nucleic acid drugs penetrate deeper into the epidermis and dermis, and ionic liquids maintain the structural integrity of nucleic acid drugs after transdermal delivery. Samir Mitragotri's group developed choline-geranic acid (CAGE) ionic liquids to enhance siRNA dermal penetration [211]. They successfully delivered siRNA to the mouse dermis by complexing this ionic liquid with siRNA. They then designed a library of ionic liquids to evaluate their efficiency for transdermal delivery of siRNA [212]. Ultimately, an ionic liquid mixture of CAGE and choline and phenylpropanoic acid (CAPA) was used to deliver siRNA targeting the Nuclear factor κB protein IκBζ (NFKBIZ) gene, which significantly reduced erythema and desquamation symptoms in psoriasis model mice.",
        "BNPs have the advantage of low immunogenicity for transdermal delivery. Andrew S. Lee used fibroblast-derived exosomes loaded with mRNA targeting VEGF-A via electroporation [213]. In contrast to adeno-associated viruses and LNPs, the modified exosomes delivered via transdermal delivery were low-immunogenic in vivo, did not cause an increase in neutrophils and macrophages, and had positive effects on repairing damaged wounds and promoting neoangiogenesis.

        "Joints are structures that connect bones to one another. The physiological structure and biological barriers of joints are shown in Fig. 13a. The basic structure of a joint includes the joint capsule, synovial membrane, synovial fluid, joint cavity, articular cartilage, and periosteum. In articular cartilage, chondrocytes are distributed at varying densities and depths, dividing the cartilage into four zones: the superficial zone, intermediate zone, deep zone, and calcified cartilage [215]. When inflammation occurs, structural homeostasis of the articular cartilage is disrupted, accompanied by extracellular matrix degradation and chondrocyte apoptosis. After intra-articular administration, drugs can enter systemic circulation through the synovium, leading to their removal from the joint cavity. Additionally, cartilage tissue comprises dense collagen fibers and negatively charged glycosaminoglycans, which limit drug penetration and distribution. Consequently, effective drug delivery to chondrocytes remains a significant challenge.Fig. 13Physiologic structure and representative nucleic acid therapeutics for the joints. a)The physiologic structure of the joint. b) Preparation and mechanism of RGD-Nanogel/siRNA Cd61 for osteoarthritis therapy through intra-articular administration [110].

        "Intra-articular administration is the primary localized injection approach for treating joint-related diseases. The joint cavity is a confined space enclosed by the synovial layer of the joint capsule and the articular cartilage, containing a small amount of synovial fluid that helps maintain joint flexibility and stability. Intra-articular administration enhances the bioavailability of nucleic acid drugs within the joints and minimizes potential side effects associated with systemic circulation [217]. Nevertheless, some drugs are also rapidly cleared from the joint after injection, limiting their efficacy. To address this issue, some studies have combined drugs with hydrogels, thereby prolonging their retention time in the joint and enabling slow, controlled drug release [218]. Other studies have incorporated contrast agents such as Gd(II) and iohexol into the hydrogel system, allowing MRI and CT imaging to monitor the degradation behavior of the hydrogel in vivo [219,220].",
        "In preclinical studies, XT-150 is a free pDNA encoding interleukin 10 (IL-10) for treating moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis. The results of Phase I/II clinical trials showed that XT-150 is well tolerated and has demonstrated analgesic effects (NCT03477487/NCT04124042) [221].",
        "Polymer structure affects the effectiveness of nucleic acid drug transfection after intra-articular injection. Shinsuke Ohba et al. synthesized polyethylene glycol-polyamino acid (Poly{N-[N’-(2-aminoethyl)-2-aminoethyl]aspartamide}) block copolymer (PEG-PAsp(DET)) and PEG-poly(N-{N’-[N’’-(2-aminoethyl)-2-aminoethyl]-2-aminoethyl}aspartamide) (PEG-PAsp(TET)) to encapsulate mRNA targeting runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1), respectively [98]. Through intra-articular administration, the results showed that mRNA delivered by PEG-PAsp(TET) exhibited higher and more persistent expression in the joint cavity compared to PEG-PAsp(DET).",
        "Peptides with targeting functions have been reported to enhance the joint-specific delivery of nucleic acid drugs [222]. Xu and colleagues engineered a chondrocyte-binding peptide (DWRVIIPPRPSA) onto the surface of exosomes derived from subcutaneous fat stromal cells [223]. Deep cartilage delivery of miR-199a-3p was achieved by intra-articular injection for reversing osteoarthritic injury. Wang et al. modified the same chondrocyte-binding peptide on the surface of exosomes derived from Expi293F cells by hydrophobic insertion. They encapsulated siRNA targeting matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) into these exosomes using electroporation [224]. The hybrid exosomes effectively silenced MMP13 in chondrocytes and attenuated cartilage degeneration after intra-articular administration.",
        "Collagen is a major component of the cartilage matrix. Type 2 collagen constitutes more than 90 % of the total collagen [225]. Targeting collagen, therefore, is an effective way to facilitate drugs penetration into the cartilage. Craig L. Duvall's team designed Collagen type 2 antibody-modified molecules with positive electrical properties, forming nanoparticles (mAbCII-siNPs) with negatively charged palmitic acid-siRNAs in an acidic environment [226]. A single intra-articular injection of mAbCII-siNPs significantly reduced arthritis progression more than weekly injections of the steroid methylprednisolone. Xie et al. developed exosomes-derived from MSCs to load siRNA for arthritis therapy [227]. To enhance the exosomes' joint retention capacity, they inserted a cationic peptide (WYRGRL) targeting type 2 collagen into the exosomes via DSPE-PEG-WYRGRL. The results showed that the peptide modification significantly prolonged the retention effect of exosomes in the joint (more than four times longer than that of unmodified exosomes) and enhanced cartilage penetration.",
        "Integration of nucleic acid drugs into hydrogels enables prolonged retention, slow release, and controlled release at the joint site. Fang and coworkers integrated agomir-29b-5p with functionalized stem cell-homing peptide (SKPPGTSS) to form an injectable hydrogel (SKP@miR) [228]. By intra-articular injection, SKP@miR could be retained in the joint cavity for more than 14 days. Moreover, treatment restored the arthritic knee joints of model rats to a state comparable to normal joints and reduced cartilage degeneration. Qin's group prepared an injectable nanogel to sustained delivery of siRNA targeting Integrin β3 (Cd61) to joints of osteoarthritis mice (Fig. 13b) [110]. The core/shell nanogel ((poly (N-isopropylmethacrylamide), PNIPMAM) was synthesized by N-isopropylmethacrylamide (NIPMAM), N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BIS), and N-(3-aminopropyl methacrylate hydrochloride) (APMA) through a free-radical precipitation polymerization. Then, RGD peptide was conjugated with nanogel through condensation reaction to enhance cell adhesion. After loading siRNA, the RGD-Nanogel/siRNA Cd61 were prepared to block osteopontin-integrin β3 signaling to treat osteoarthritis.",
        "Cartilage tissue contains a large number of negatively charged proteoglycans. Therefore, cationic delivery systems can be used to enhance the retention of nucleic acid drugs in chondrocytes. For instance, Christine T. N. Pham et al. constructed cationic amphipathic peptide “p5RHH” (VLTTGLPALISWIRRRHRRHC) to form a complex with siRNA targeting nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), stabilizing the outer layer with albumin to produce p5RHH-siRNA nanoparticles [229]. The p5RHH-siRNA nanoparticles deeply penetrated osteoarthritis cartilage after articular injection and persisted in the chondrocyte lumen for at least 2 weeks.",
        "DNA-based nanomaterials also show potential in local nucleic acid therapeutics for joint. Endogenous MSCs enhancement is considered one of the effective ways to treat osteoarthritis. As shown in Fig. 13c, Zhu et al. constructed an aptamer (HM69, for recruiting MSCs)-modified tetrahedral framework nucleic acid [216]. And, transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-β3), which can induce cartilage formation, was attached to this HM69-modified tetrahedral framework nucleic acid via an S-S bond. After intra-articular administration, endogenous MSCs were recruited to the joints of model mice and articular cartilage scores were enhanced. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by synovial inflammation. In order to regulate the synovial inflammation, Lin and coworkers developed tetrahedral framework nucleic acids to deliver miR-23b (T-23b) [230]. Local intra-articular injection of T-23b significantly inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration and synovial proliferation, thereby alleviating synovial injury.

        "The heart is the central organ of the circulatory system, primarily composed of cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. It is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body to meet metabolic and physiological needs. The physiological structure of the heart is shown in Fig. 14a, It has four chambers: the left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, and right ventricle. The heart also has coronary arteries (including the left and right coronary arteries) that supply blood and oxygen to the myocardium, as well as veins. The heart has a dense membranous structure, which includes the fibrous pericardium, parietal pericardium, pericardial space, epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium [239]. Among these, the fibrous pericardium consists of tightly packed connective tissue that prevents the heart from overexpanding. The endocardium is composed of a single layer of endothelial cells, forming a dense “blood-heart barrier” that prevents macromolecules and particles from entering cardiomyocytes [240]. Additionally, coronary endothelial cells block the entry of drugs into the myocardium through tight cellular junctions. Together with the heart's high blood flow and metabolism, delivering nucleic acid drugs to the heart remains a significant challenge.Fig. 14Physiologic structure and representative nucleic acid therapeutics for the heart. a)The physiologic structure of the heart. b) Preparation and mechanism of miR-30d@ZIF-8 and AuNPs conductive microneedles for myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury therapy [241].

        "The main methods of local administration to the heart include intra-myocardial and intra-coronary injections [242]. Intra-myocardial administration involves injecting drugs directly into the myocardium through epicardial, endocardial, or trans-coronary routes [243]. This approach allows for efficient enrichment of nucleic acid drugs in cardiomyocytes [244]. Epicardial intra-myocardial administration requires invasive open-heart surgery and a long postoperative recovery time. Endocardial intra-myocardial administration involves using a catheter to enter the ventricular cavity from the peripheral blood, either retrogradely through the arterial system or through the venous system via septal vein puncture. This approach is less invasive but requires expensive equipment. Trans-coronary intra-myocardial injection uses a catheter inserted through the femoral vein into the coronary sinus to deliver drugs. This method is also relatively less invasive. Intra-coronary administration involves injecting the drug directly into the coronary arteries through a catheter [243]. It is further classified into antegrade and retrograde coronary injections. Retrograde intra-coronary injection involves delivering drugs through the coronary sinus and requires blocking coronary blood flow to eliminate the effects of collateral flow on pressure. Intra-coronary administration distributes the drug more evenly throughout the heart and results in less myocardial damage than intra-myocardial injections [245]. However, due to the high blood flow and metabolism of the heart, the drug is quickly absorbed into the body's circulation, leading to reduced retention in the heart.",
        "Researchers have also explored achieving extended and sustained release of drugs in the heart by implanting patches or hydrogels loaded with nucleic acid drugs, as well as enabling real-time monitoring of cardiac electrophysiological activity, which has shown promising applications [246]. In addition, inhaled drug delivery approaches have also been used to target the heart. Shu et al. developed inhalable cardiac-targeting peptide (CTP)-modified calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles to target cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts for the treatment of heart failure [247].",
        "VEGF, one of the key targets for the treatment of coronary artery disease, can promote angiogenesis and cardiac repair. In clinical trials, pDNA encoding VEGF (phVEGF165) was administered intra-myocardially to treat coronary artery disease. Phase I/II clinical trials have shown that phVEGF165 has a good safety profile and can improve myocardial infarction outcomes (NCT00135850) [248]. AZD8601, an mRNA drug encoding VEGF-A, was developed by AstraZeneca and Moderna for heart failure therapy via epicardial injection (NCT02935712/NCT03370887). Results from the Phase I/II clinical trials indicated that AZD8601 did not pose a safety burden and alleviated heart failure symptoms in patients [249]. INXN-4001 contains three pDNAs encoding VEGF (affecting calcium handling), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1α, affecting angiogenesis), and S100 calcium binding protein A1 (S100A1, affecting progenitor cell recruitment), respectively [250]. These plasmids were used to treat heart failure via retrograde intracoronary injection. In the 6-month trial, no adverse effects were observed with INXN-4001, and there was evidence of improvement in heart failure symptoms (NCT03409627) [251].",
        "To validate VEGF as a therapeutic target in a larger animal model, Regina Fritsche-Danielson's group administered purified VEGF-A mRNA through intra-myocardial injection in a porcine model of myocardial infarction [252]. Their findings demonstrated efficient VEGF-A protein expression in porcine hearts, which promoted neovascularization and improved cardiac function recovery post-infarction.",
        "In optimized mRNA myocardial local delivery research, Kenneth R Chien et al. synthesized various nucleotide-modified RNAs (modRNAs) for intra-myocardial administration in myocardial infarction treatment [253]. By comparison with mRNA and pDNA encoding same VEGF target, modRNA induced less immune responses than mRNA and prolonged the survival of myocardial infarction mice more than pDNA. P. Vader and colleagues explored the impact of different LNP ratios on the transfection efficiency of modRNAs through intra-myocardial administration [254]. The LNP formulations comprised C12-200 ionized lipids, cholesterol, helper lipids (DOPC or DOPE), and PEG-conjugated lipids (DMG-PEG). Through systematic screening, they identified the optimal formulation with a ratio of C12-200:Chol:DOPE at 40 %:43.5 %:15 %, which demonstrated the highest transfection efficiency in both fibroblasts and epicardial cells.",
        "MicroRNAs play important roles in both promoting angiogenesis and treating cardiovascular diseases. MicroRNA-21 can target multiple anti-angiogenesis genes, thereby promoting the vascularization process. To deliver miRNAs efficiently into cardiomyocytes, Yang et al. constructed inflammatory environment-responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) to deliver microRNA-21-5p [255]. These were encapsulated in a hydrogel for the treatment of myocardial infarction via intra-myocardial administration. On one hand, MSNs suppressed the inflammatory response by inhibiting the polarization of M1 macrophages in the infarcted myocardium. On the other hand, microRNA-21-5p promoted local neointimal formation, demonstrating a good therapeutic effect in the pig infarction model. Cai and co-workers developed exosomes derived from cardiac telocytes (CT) to treat myocardial infarction through intra-myocardial administration [256]. They found that miRNA-21-5p in CT exosomes promoted myocardial revascularization by interfering with the p53 target 1 (Cdip1) gene. Han et al. investigated the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of exosomes overexpressing miR-214-3p derived from MSCs in acute myocardial infarction [257]. After intra-myocardial administration, miR-214-3p overexpressed MSCs-exosomes significantly reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and improved cardiac function in acute myocardial infarction rats. The phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway is one of the potential mechanisms. Bei and co-workers developed conductive microneedle patches to deliver ZIF-8 (miR-30d@ZIF-8) and Au NPs loaded with miR-30d to treat myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury [241]. As shown in Fig. 14b, after miR-30d@ZIF-8 within the patch was released, miR-30d was released to achieve anti-apoptosis and anti-fibrosis through ZIF-8's escape from the endosomes/lysosomes. Au NPs promoted electrical impulse conduction and restored myocardial electrophysiological function.

        "Summary of local nucleic acid therapeutics for heart.",
        "This review discusses the research progresses of various non-viral nucleic acid drugs therapeutics for local administration in extrahepatic diseases. Compared to systemic administration, the main advantages of local administration are: 1) high local drug concentration in target organs: local administration delivers the drug directly to the lesion, significantly increasing the local drug concentration; 2) low systemic side effects: local administration avoids systemic circulation and first-pass effects, reducing adverse effects on non-target tissues; 3) good patient compliance: the locally administered drug has a high local concentration and a long duration of action, requiring less frequent administration. However, biological barriers associated with different diseases pose challenges for the design of nucleic acid drug delivery vectors. Nucleic acid drug delivery techniques adapted for systemic administration are not necessarily suitable for local injection. It is anticipated that rationally designed delivery systems will overcome these physiological barriers by modulating interactions among the vectors, nucleic acid drugs, and the physiological environments of the diseases.",
        "For local lung delivery, the upper airway barrier (mucus, cilia, etc.) and the alveolar barrier (collagen, etc.) are the main biological barriers limiting nucleic acid drug availability. The main approaches for drug delivery are inhalation, nasal administration, and intratracheal injection. Among them, nebulized inhalation must also consider the effect of mechanical shear generated by the nebulizer on the integrity of nanoparticles. Nucleic acid drug delivery systems for local injection in the lungs should be designed by considering factors such as electrical properties, hydrophilicity, particle sizes, and surface PEG coating. In addition, peptides, small molecules, and Apts with cellular targeting capabilities can be considered for modification in the delivery systems to enhance the targeting of nucleic acid drugs.",
        "For the brain, the BBB, blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, arachnoid barrier, and nose-brain barrier are the major physiological barriers. Lateral ventricular administration, intrathecal administration, and transnasal administration are commonly used for localized brain injections. PNPs and LNPs that can efficiently load nucleic acid drugs and enable endosome escape are commonly used as vectors. In addition, BNPs can also be functionally modified to achieve efficient delivery of cleic acid drugs and synergistic therapies. INPs are also commonly used to trace the in vivo behavior of nucleic acid drugs in the brain through MRI, CT, and so on.",
        "For eye delivery, tears, the corneal barrier, the vitreous barrier, and the blood-retinal barrier are the major biological barriers. Ocular surface drops, retinal, intraocular, conjunctival, and vitreous administration are the primary local delivery approaches for nucleic acid drugs. Hydrophobic and electronegative nucleic acid drug delivery systems are better suited for topical ocular injections. Apts hold great promise for clinical applications in the treatment of ocular diseases. Several targeting molecules, apts, and negatively charged functional groups that modify the delivery systems can facilitate the barrier penetration of nucleic acid drugs.",
        "For local skin delivery, the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale are the main physiological barriers. Transdermal, intradermal, and subcutaneous administration are the main methods for nucleic acid drug delivery. Liquids and ointments are the primary forms used for transdermal administration. To enhance transdermal efficiency, physical approaches such as electroporation, localized ultrasound, iontophoresis, and lasers are frequently combined. Several ionic liquids and peptides that can open tight junctions of the barriers have also been developed to facilitate the penetration of nucleic acid drugs through the stratum corneum.",
        "For local joint delivery, clearance by synovial fluid and the low permeability of cartilage are the main biological barriers. Intra-articular administration is the most important mode of local drug delivery. Vectors modified with peptides that bind to chondrocytes and collagen can enhance joint-specific delivery of nucleic acid drugs. Positively charged vectors enhance drug retention in the joints through electrostatic interactions with proteoglycans. The integration of nucleic acid drugs into hydrogels can prolong drug retention, enable slow release, and provide controlled release at the joint sites.",
        "For local heart delivery, the tight junctions of the fibrous pericardium, parietal pericardium, pericardial cavity, epicardium, myocardium, endocardium, and coronary endothelial cells prevent nucleic acid drugs from entering the heart lesion. Moreover, the high blood flow, metabolism, and extracellular matrix also represent major physiological barriers. Intra-myocardial and intra-coronary injections are the main local delivery approaches. The integration of nucleic acid drug delivery systems into cardiac patches or hydrogels may extend the release time of the drug in the heart, potentially reducing the frequency of administration and allowing for more efficient treatment of heart-related diseases.",
        "With current advances in clinical marketing and preclinical studies, modifications or conjugates to nucleic acid drugs remain the predominant delivery technique. However, conjugation delivery technology is only applicable to relatively small fragments of nucleic acid drugs such as ASO and siRNA. LNPs have also been applied clinically in siRNA and mRNA systemic delivery. However, the design principles of local delivery LNPs are not the same as those of systemic delivery LNPs. In local applications, LNPs should also be adjusted according to the characteristics of the disease. PNPs can achieve multifunctional delivery of nucleic acid drugs through clever design of polymers. However, it is very difficult to precisely control the preparation of polymers and PNPs. INPs have good stability and are easy to be functionalized modification. They can also be used as contrast agents or auxiliary therapy formulations to guide or enhance therapeutic effects. Meanwhile, the potential metabolic burden in vivo is a concerning point in clinical applications. BNPs possess therapeutic miRNAs, proteins, and have homologous targeting, and good biocompatibility. However, the unclear composition, low nucleic acid drug loading capacity, and difficulty in large-scale extraction limit their further application. DNA origami based nanomaterials can be prepared with high precision and controllability, with great potentials in local nucleic acid drug delivery. Nevertheless, their design and preparation process are relatively complex, and the cost is also high. In specific applications, appropriate nucleic acid drugs and related delivery technologies should be selected based on disease characteristics and delivery needs.",
        "The application of nucleic acid drugs for the treatment of extrahepatic diseases is still limited. In addition to the bio-barriers, the following limitations persist for localized injections compared to systemic injections: 1) limited scope of application: local administration may allow for the enrichment of nucleic acid drugs in specific organs, but it is primarily confined to diseases affecting the lungs, brain, eyes, skin, joints, and heart. For systemic diseases and deep tissue lesions, local administration remains challenging. 2) Complexity of operation. For the brain, heart, and joints, localized administration is much more difficult to manipulate. 3) Potential risks. Brain delivery, for example, faces unacceptable risks caused by craniotomy. For skin delivery, it may causes local irritation and allergic reactions.",
        "Based on the deficiencies in local administration, nucleic acid drugs for extrahepatic disease therapy may also require approaches beyond local injection. For instance, specific expression of mRNA in the liver, spleen, and lungs can also be achieved by modulating the charge properties of liposomes [259,260]. Additionally, modifying the hydrophilic head groups and hydrophobic structures of lipid molecules can enable efficient mRNA expression in bone marrow [261]. Selective delivery of nucleic acid drugs to specific organs can also be achieved by using microbubbles. Vectors combined with microbubbles can be co-delivered in vivo and irradiated with focused ultrasound, creating a cavitation effect that enables the selective delivery of nucleic acid drugs to specific organs [262].",
        "On the other hand, due to patient heterogeneity, the same nucleic acid drug delivery system may not be suitable for all patients. Thus, medical imaging is essential for guiding nucleic acid drug delivery. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers significant potential to manage the complex interactions between multivariate nano-delivery systems and nucleic acid drugs. AI can assist researchers in predicting the properties of delivery systems and accelerate high-throughput screening of vectors. Moreover, integrating AI with gene target screening holds great promise for expediting the clinical application of nucleic acid drugs. Advances in microfluidics have facilitated the synthesis of more homogeneous and controllable nanodelivery systems to optimise nucleic acid drug delivery. The development of organoid microarrays has accelerated the process of screening and optimising nucleic acid therapeutics. In conclusion, the future development of local nucleic acid therapeutics relies on the deep integration of technologies such as chemical synthesis, biological evaluation, medical diagnostics and evaluation, nanotechnology, AI, and microfluidics.",

        "According to a comprehensive population‐wide analysis, IHD is the main cause of human death in the twenty-first century [1, 2]. Due to the loss of cardiomyocyte membrane integrity, multiple diagnostic biomarkers such as creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), and cTnI are released into the circulation [3, 4]. Inadequate oxygen levels and nutrient delivery into the myocardium can contribute to an irreversible loss of functional cardiomyocytes and weakening of ventricular contractility, resulting in heart failure [5–7]. Although reperfusion approaches and fibrinolytic therapies are helpful in the restoration of cardiac tissue output, the possibility of bleeding, blood clot formation, wound infection, thromboembolism, pericardial effusion, etc. are life-treating factors in MI patients [8, 9]. Thus, it is mandatory to develop new modalities with more therapeutic outcomes and fewer post-complications in MI patients. While timely diagnosis in the initial stages, long-term follow-up, and prognosis of ischemic changes are mandatory in clinical settings and are beneficial to increase the efficiency of therapeutic protocols [10–13].",
        "Like several tissue types, cardiac homeostasis and the healing process are well-organized intercellular communications and are in part controlled by EVs [14]. EVs are heterogeneous and nano-sized vesicles and are involved in the transfer of growth factors, lipids, DNAs, mRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) [15–17]. In general, EVs include Exos, microvesicles (MVs or ectosomes), and apoptotic bodies with different sizes, biogenesis systems, cargoes, and functions [18–21]. Among EV types, Exos are produced by the endosomal system and actively participate in intercellular crosstalk [22]. In the acceptor cells, the internalized Exos are guided to the lumen of early endosomes (Fig. 1) [20, 23]. Inside the cells, endogenous Exos are also generated by endosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs), leading to the production of numerous intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) [24]. Using multiple effectors such as ESCRTs, SNAREs, RABs, etc. ILVs are released into the extracellular matrix (ECM), hereafter known as Exos (Fig. 2) [25–35].Fig. 1Exo biogenesis and secretion routes inside the host cells. Internalized Exos are packed inside the intracellular vesicles named early endosomes. Early endosomes mature into later endosomes and MVBs. Along with these changes, several new ILVs are generated via the invagination of the vesicle membrane. Several biomolecules are sequestrated inside the ILVs. MVBs with numerous ILVs are guided toward lysosomal degradation to fuse cell membranes to release their contents (ILVs) into the extracellular matrix where they are called hereafter ExosFig. 2Different molecular pathways are involved in the generation of ILVs. MVBs with numerous intraluminal ILVs are generated using multiple pathways. To be specific, ESCRT-dependent and ESCRT-independent pathways can control the generation of de novo ILVs. In the canonical ESCRT-dependent pathways, four complexes including ESCRT-0, -I, -II, -III along with ATPase VPS4 regulate the dominant process of ILV formation (1). The complementary non-canonical ESCRT-dependent pathways, effectors such as HD-PTP (2) or Alix (3) in close collaboration with ESCRT-III and VPS4 sequestrate certain biosignaling molecules into the MVBs. In line with these activities, lipid rafts belonging to non-canonical ESCRT-dependent systems are also important. More interestingly, some tetraspanins such as CD63 are involved in the generation of nascent ILVs by both ESCRT and ceramide-independent mechanisms. It is thought that the nSMase2-ceramide pathway is another important molecular axis that regulates the formation of ILVs in MVBs in an ESCRT-independent manner. Factors such as caveolin-1 or flotillins proceed with the formation of ILVs by lipid raft-dependent pathways with simultaneous activation of the nSMase-ceramide pathway in some cell types.

        "Recent research has pointed to the valuable role of EVs mainly Exos in the detection and monitoring of IHD (Table 1). Exos can easily reach biofluids, thus making them invaluable diagnostic tools in IHD patients [36]. Exo cargo is a real-time reflection of the metabolic status of original cardiomyocytes. Thus, these nanoparticles (NPs) can be used as valid theranostics after MI occurrence [37, 38]. Cardiomyocyte Exos harbor diverse biomolecules like proteins, lipids, and RNAs [messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)], and other compounds. The content and cargo types can be varied according to the specific pathophysiological circumstances [39]. Data have confirmed that the release of cardiac tissue EVs is fast compared to free conventional biomarkers like cTnI in various ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) models. Therefore, it is possible to follow cardiac tissue-specific miRNAs in plasma less than 4 h, after the occurrence of MI [40, 41]. Some miRNAs such as miRNA-133a/b, -320, -499, -1, and -208a have relatively diagnostic values for monitoring the function of cardiomyocytes [41]. Exosomal miRNAs and other genetic elements are resistant to degradation processes with key diagnostic values for IHD [42–44]. Most of the exosomal miRNAs are associated with the regulation of cardiomyocyte bioactivity and homeostasis. Thus, elevation/reduction of specific miRNA types can reflect the real-time changes within the heart after being exposed to insulting conditions [39]. For example, p53 signaling cascade-responsive miRNAs such as miRNA-192, -194, and -34a, are abundant in the serum Exos of individuals with acute MI [45]. Hypoxic cardiomyocytes can produce Exos with higher levels of miRNA-222, -143, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) compared to normal cardiomyocytes [46]. There is a close relationship between specific miRNA types and heart tissue function. The levels of exosomal miRNA-152-5p, -204, lncRNA NEAT1, and -3681-5p can indicate the possibility of ST-segment and MI occurrence [47, 48].Table 1Alteration of some genetic elements and factors in cardiac cell Exos under different conditionsCytokines and proteinsmiRNAsMI or other stressful conditions compared to the normal statusReferencesApolipoprotein D, Apolipoprotein C3, Complement C1q, subcomponent subunit A (C1Q1A), Complement C5 (C5), Glycoprotein Ib Platelet Subunit Alpha (GP1BA), Pro-Platelet Basic Protein, HSp20, HSp60, HSp70, IL-6, Glut1, Glut4, NAD(p)H oxidase, TNF-a, Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), EGFR, Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, Fibronectin, Collagen, Alix, HIF-1α, TGF-β, CD63, MMP, collagen alpha-1 (I) chain precursor, heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein, angiopoietin-related protein 2 precursor, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, serine protease HTRA1 precursor, elongation factor 1-alpha 1-like, sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-1 precursor, Na, K-ATPase alpha-1 subunit, ATPase, Na + /K + transporting, alpha 1 polypeptide, isoform CRA, apolipoprotein E precursor, L-Lactate dehydrogenase A chain, L-Lactate dehydrogenase B chain, polyubiquitin-C precursor, clathrin heavy chain 1miR-133a, miR-21, miR-423, miR-328, miR-29b, miR-208, miR-499, miR-1, miR-192, miR-1956, miR-34a, miR-134, miR-194, miR-126, miR-486, miR-3681, miR-152, miR-3681, lncRNA Zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1), Cdr1 antisense (CDR1AS), lncRNA HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), miR-125a-5p, miR-100-5p, miR-365a-3p, miR-193b-5p, miR-99a-5p, miR-193a-5p, miR-361-5p, miR-29a-3p, miR-885-5p, miR-345-5p, miR-1246, miR-3692-5p, miR-193b-3p, miR-654-3p, miR-1260b, miR-22-3p, miR-3168, let-7d-3p, miR-6763-3p, miR-320b, miR-155, miR-206-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-494-3p, miR-300c, miR-320, miR-17, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a, miR-30v, let-7e, miR-10a, miR-27b, miR-100, miR-126-3p, miR-130a, miR-143, miR-503, miR-222,Increased[10, 46, 47, 141–176]miR-197, miR-106, miR-223, miR-4520–2-3p, miR-5579-5p, miR-3681-5p, miR-212-3p, let-7f-1-3p, miR-30c-2-3p, miR-126Reduced",
        "Alteration of some genetic elements and factors in cardiac cell Exos under different conditions",
        "Exosomal proteins and peptides are also valuable predictive biomarkers for MI. The existence of different proteins in cardiac tissue Exos such as sarcomeric proteins, cardiac-type myosin-binding protein C, myomesin, tropomyosin, and valosin-containing protein can help us to discriminate them from non-cardiac tissue sources [49]. In patients with elevated ST-segment, exosomal platelet-derived GPIIb and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) increased [50]. Other common biomarkers such as TNF-α and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) are elevated in cardiomyocyte Exos [51, 52].",
        "Some studies have revealed that the release of Exos from injured cardiomyocytes can promote further cytopathic effects. For instance, cardiomyocyte-derived Exos containing heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), and TNF-α can interact with toll-like receptors (TLR), stimulating apoptotic changes [53]. While other exosomal HSPs like HSP70 can protect the cardiomyocytes against I/R injury via the activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway [54]. The activation of other mechanisms such as autophagy [beclin-1↑, LC3-II/LC3-I ratio↑, and, Atg12↑] by exosomal miRNAs (miRNA-30a) is possible [55]. Local Exos (miRNA-143 and -222) can stimulate the angiogenesis inside the injured myocardium, resulting in the reduction of fibrotic changes. Cardiac progenitor cells can release Exos containing several pro-angiogenesis factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), transforming growth factor-β, and miRNA-132 to re-establish the blood supplementation, reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis (PDCD4↓ and miRNA-21↓, and -210), and cardiac fibrosis [miRNA-29b, -323-5p, -455, and -466] [46, 56–59]. These Exos can blunt the oxidative damage of cardiomyocytes and deactivate Caspases 3, and 7 [60].",
        "In terms of cardiovascular disease, it is possible to deliver naïve or engineered Exos using a variety of administration methods (Fig. 3). For instance, intravenous, intracardial, intradermal, epicardial, and intraperitoneal routes have been proposed to deliver the Exos to target sites [61–65]. Among different administration methods, intravenous injection is a non-invasive approach. However, off-target distribution and rapid elimination from circulation are the main drawbacks. The sequestration of Exos by hepatic, splenic tissues, and pulmonary vascular system after intravenous administration requires repeated and high doses of Exos [66–68]. Notably, data have indicated that intravenously infused Exos accelerated the healing of ischemic myocardium in several animal models [69–71]. In contrast to intravenous infusion, the direct intracoronary artery and intramyocardial injection can circumvent several limitations such as off-target delivery and non-specific sequestration in the liver, spleen, and other tissues [8]. Based on previous data, the direct introduction of Exos via myocardium and intracoronary route improved efficiently the healing of ischemic myocardium in animal models [72, 73]. For example, the intramyocardial injection of cardiosphere-derived cells in pig models led to improved ventricular function compared to intracoronary infusion groups [74]. It seems that intramyocardial injection is more effective in the alleviation of pathological conditions compared to the intracoronary administration method because this approach provides a suitable platform for the efficient delivery of higher exosomal cargo into the injured myocardium with enhanced retention time, and prominent Exo-to-cardiac cell interaction [75]. Besides, this approach avoids the direct contact of Exos with the blood components and specific biological barriers. However, catheter-based delivery or open-chest surgery is available for the intramyocardial injection of Exos [76, 77]. It has been indicated that the intramyocardial injection can increase left ventricular ejection fraction in both acute and chronic MI models via the reduction of abnormal cardiac remodeling, and fibrosis [72]. Despite these advantages, the invasive entity of intramyocardial injection makes it relatively problematic in clinical cardiology [72]. The direct injection of Exos into the injured myocardium can contribute to rapid elimination, and loss of exosomal integrity before obtaining regenerative benefits [75]. Due to poor negative charge, Exos form microaggregates which affect their distribution, and even delivery properties [78]. Of note, repeated high doses of Exos can provoke immune cell reactivity in allogeneic models, leading to the stimulation of inflammation at the site of injury and a postponed healing process [79]. The therapeutic effects of Exos at the site of injury are associated with the promotion of phenotype acquisition in macrophages, and the reduction of inflammation and aberrant ECM remodeling [49, 80]. For instance, rat bone marrow MSC Exos can blunt nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and NLRP3 inflammasome with the potential to control the inflammatory response in oxygen/glucose-deprived H9c2 cardiomyocytes [81]. Certain molecular complexes such as miR-5p/TRAF axis can regulate inflammatory response via engaging the NF-κB signaling pathway [82]. Cardiac phenotypic plasticity after treatment with stem cell Exos is another mechanism by which these cells can resist harsh microenvironments. To be specific, cardiomyocytes can differentiate into the myofibroblasts to escape from the apoptotic changes, and inflammatory conditions [83]. The reduction of fibrosis is related to the reduction of collagen fiber deposition and conversion of dormant fibroblasts into reparative phenotype [84]. In situations associated with an extensive myocardial infarction, or epicardial ischemia, Exos can be administrated from the epicardial surface via open heart surgery and/or video-assisted cardiac surgery [85, 86]. It is postulated that this approach enables us to more focused conveyance of Exos into the injured sites especially in patients without the possibility of open-heart surgery [85, 86].Fig. 3Several possible Exo applications for the alleviation of ischemic myocardium. Each approach has its advantages and limitations. The systemic administration of Exos can yield low on-target effects while increasing the rapid elimination of circulating Exos via the activity of immune cells. Local administration of free Exos (direct intracoronary artery, intramyocardial, intrapericardial, and catheter-based intracardial injections) or injection via supporting substrates and hydrogels can increase the on-target delivery efficiency into the ischemic area.

        "In less invasive approaches, hydrogel-bearing Exos can be used as cardiac patches on the pericardial surface or directly injected into the deep layers of the myocardium for sustained release of Exos into the target sites [87]. The porosity, swelling rate, and biodegradability of these compounds make them release loaded Exos in a controllable manner [2]. Based on data from different studies, Exos can be loaded into the hydrogel using different strategies. In one approach, Exos, polymers, and cross-linkers are mixed simultaneously and injected into the site of injury. The gelation in in vivo conditions enables the sustained release of Exos [88]. To help the gelation of hydrogels, ion change, UV irradiation, pH, and temperature regulation are also suggested based on the chemical structure and type of substances [89, 90]. Hydrogels acquire the shape and geometries of injured sites to fill and adhere the inured site to surrounding neighboring tissue [90]. It is also possible to mix polymers and cross-linkers before the addition of Exos. This approach promotes hydrogel gelation and Exos are incorporated into the hydrogels. In another strategy, the dehydrated hydrogels can be incubated in Exo-containing solutions. The porous structure allows the breathing of Exos into deep layers of hydrogel [91]. Therefore, hydrogels should possess a pore size larger than Exo diameter to facilitate exosomal breathing while a much bigger pore size increases uncontrolled Exo leakage before and after transplantation [88, 92]. In the last protocol, Exos and polymeric solution are mixed followed by the addition of cross-linkers to accelerate the gelation [93]. The cross-linked hydrogels possess suitable mechanical strength and degradation rates. However, the existence of unreacted cross-linkers can lead to cytotoxic effects. Even, some cross-linker types are toxic even after being reacted with the polymeric backbone. Thus, the use of nontoxic compounds for hydrogel polymerization should be lessened [94]. In an experiment, growth hormone-releasing peptides in combination with amphiphilic peptides C16-GTAGLIGQ were used to increase the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) Exo retention time in a rat model of MI [95]. Data indicated the reduction of inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, and stimulation of angiogenesis [95]. In another study, tyramine-functionalized hyaluronic acid (6%) was blended with cardiomyocyte Exos (~ equals 10–100 exosomal protein) and used for the differentiation of human MSCs into cardiomyocytes [96]. This platform stimulated the viability of human MSCs and differentiation toward GATA4↑, Nkx2.5↑, and Tbx5↑ cardiomyocytes [96]. It seems that the covalent attachment of Exos into the polymeric structure increases the retention time after transplantation into the target sites. In an experiment, thiolated Exos anchoring a CP05 peptide was cross-linked to thiolated hyaluronic acid using epoxy macromere and aniline tetramer. The developed hydrogel can promote the migration of human endothelial cells (ECs) and MSCs. The injection of Exo-bearing hydrogel was shown to accelerate angiogenesis potential [PECAM↑, VEGF↑ (isoforms A and B), α-SMA↑, vWF↑) and cardiogenesis (Cx43↑, SERCA2a↑, Ki-67↑) [97].",
        "It seems that pre-treated cell sources can produce specific Exo types with improved regenerative outcomes. The incorporation of HIF-1α-expressing MSC Exos into RGD hydrogels efficiently reduced the fibrosis rate and promoted the function of the injured myocardium with a reduction of apoptotic cardiomyocytes (Caspases 3↓, and 7↓) [98].",
        "It is mandatory to use sophisticated strategies to maximize Exo distribution into the myocardium via direct interaction with cardiomyocytes or cardiac tissue vascular system [6, 7]. To date, two main modification strategies have been used for exosomal surface and internal engineering (Fig. 4). For this purpose, Exos can be modified before isolation (indirect method) by manipulation of host cells or Exos are directly subjected to engineering protocols after enrichment (direct method) (Table 2) [1]. These approaches have led to enhanced healing capacity and targeting efficiency (Table 3). In recent years, the application of gene editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 systems has been extended to biological systems. EVs are valid bioshuttles for transferring the CRISPR-Cas9 products into the recipient cells [99]. This system is eligible to efficiently modify the surface of EVs for various therapeutic purposes (Fig. 5) [100]. In a recent work conducted by Mun et al., they used CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-loaded EVs decorated with cardiac-targeting peptide (T) for the edition of ischemic cardiomyocyte miR-34a [101]. Data revealed the successful delivery (~ twofold) of EVs into cardiac tissue, regulation of target miR-34a, and reduction of apoptotic changes (Cleaved caspase 3↓, and Bax↓) in infarcted mice. Schary and co-workers found that the disruption of the TLR4 gene using CRISPR-Cas9 in MSCs led to an increase in viability, suitable cardiac tissue remodeling, and function in infarcted mice [102]. Data indicated that the parent cell manipulation via CRISPR-Cas9 can affect the levels of inflammatory factors inside released MSC EVs [102]. Despite these adamantanes, genetic materials have relatively short lives inside EVs which can lead to a lack of appropriate gene editing therapy, and regenerative benefits [99]. Besides, its immunogenicity, and non-desired immune responses should be precisely monitored [103].Fig. 4Different strategies are used for cargo loading and increase of on-target delivery of Exos into the ischemic myocardium. The sophisticated manipulations can be done on the parent cells or directly on the purified Exos before injection into the target sites. These approaches increase the delivery efficiency and therapeutic outcomes of administrated Exos in the ischemic myocardium.

        "To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports related to the application of engineered Exos in the cardiovascular system [8]. In this scenario, Exo modification has been done for different purposes as follows; a) to track fluorophore-, luminescence reporter-, and radiotracer-labelled Exos after being injected into in vivo systems. Both Exo surface and lumen can be modified with these tracers, b) to increase Exo bioactivity and therapeutic benefit, c) to improve on-target delivery efficiency by using various peptides, proteins, and lipids on the exosomal surface, and d) to stimulate internalization rate and endo-lysosomal escape using certain cell-penetrating and pH-sensitive peptides, and cationic lipids [104]. The indirect Exo modification can provide a continuous source for biomedical purposes [20, 105]. To modify the parent cells to produce certain Exos, direct genetic manipulations, incubation with certain compounds, and changes in culture conditions are applicable options [104, 106–111]. Tetraspanins, Lamp-2b, lactadherin, glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI), and PDGFR are target proteins for the production of engineered Exos [112, 113]. The treatment of Lamp2b expressing cardiosphere derived cell Exos with cardiac-specific peptide, WLSEAGPVVTVRALRGTGSW, produced engineered Exos with enhanced internalization capacity into the cardiomyocytes and higher retention time compared to non-engineered Exos (Fig. 6) [114]. In a similar study, transfection of HEK293 cells with cardiac-targeting peptide-Lamp2b expressing vector generated engineered Exos with higher delivery efficiency in in vitro and in vivo conditions [115]. Other researchers produced engineered Exos with recombinant Lamp2b-ischemic myocardial targeting peptide [CSTSMLKAC] or Lamp2b-heart homing peptide with a higher internalization rate in hypoxic cardiomyocytes [116, 117]. In addition to the targeting approach, some authorities used modified Exos for the alteration of metabolic profile. For instance, βARKct expressing cardiosphere cell Exos was used in a mouse model of catecholamine toxicity. Data indicated that βARKct-bearing Exos efficiently inhibits GRK2, resulting in the reduction of heart failure [118]. Despite the advantages related to indirect Exo modification, genetic manipulation of host cells may alter the biogenesis of Exos and the levels of target molecules can be less in the released Exos [104]. Therefore, direct modification approaches can be used for improving loading and targeting efficiencies irrespective of host cell origin [25].Fig. 6Cardiomyocyte-specific binding peptide (CMP)-targeted Exos reduced mouse cardiomyocyte programmed cell death in vitro after 7 days (a–e; Scale bar: 100 µm). Cardiomyocytes were incubated with peptide (WLSEAGPVVTVRALRGTGSW) plus vehicle (10 µM DMSO) (b), naïve Exos (c), CMP-targeted Exos (d), or CMP-targeted Exos + synthetic peptide (e) for 24 h for controlling the apoptosis.

        "To encapsulate exogenous compounds into the Exo lumen, various techniques including cycle freeze–thaw, electroporation, sonication, incubation, extrusion, agitation, and treatment with detergents have been used in different studies [20]. Among these approaches, freeze–thaw and incubation are inactive encapsulation methods. Using freeze–thaw methods, hydrophobic curcumin was loaded in Exos for the alleviation of MI [119]. Bheri and colleagues used electroporated EC-specific miRNA-126-loaded CPC EVs for the reduction of fibrosis and promotion of cardiac repair in a rat model of I/R injury [120]. Data exhibited reduced fibrotic region and cardiomyocyte diameter in the infarct zone after 28 days. Along with these changes, the number of Isolectin-B4+ capillaries and α-SMA+ arterioles was increased compared to the sham groups and rats that received naïve EVs (Fig. 7) [120]. Sonication or ultrasound waves can produce several microspores in the lipid membrane and help the internalization of compounds into the Exo lumen [121]. Lamichhane and co-workers loaded HER2 siRNA into EVs for targeting human breast cancer cells MCF-7 [122]. In another experiment, melatonin was loaded into adipose tissue stem cell EVs via sonication and administrated in a mouse model of MI. Data confirmed improved myocardial regeneration via angiogenesis (CD31+ vessels), and reduction of oxidative stress (dihydroethidium↓) [123]. Additionally, detergents such as Triton-X100 (0.01%) were used for loading different compounds such as mycophenolic acid in immune cell Exos (i.e. macrophages) to reduce inflammatory response [124].Fig. 7Administration of miR-126-loaded CPC EVs (miR-126 + ELVs) in rats with I/R injury led to angiogenesis after 28 days (A–D).

        "Besides the load of several therapeutics into the Exo lumen, modification strategies can be done on the Exo surface to increase the cardiomyocyte targeting properties using physical and chemical approaches. The chemical strategy of Exo surface includes covalent (bio-conjugation, cloaking, and click chemistry) and non-covalent (ligand-receptor, electrostatic, hydrophobic, interactions, and inorganic interaction) modifications [20]. In a recent study done by Shiqi et al., they used platelet membranes to cloak the Exos and increase the internalization rate into cardiomyocytes and ECs [44]. Vandergriff and co-workers used the DOPE-NHS linker to attach cardiac homing peptide on the external surface of stem cell Exos. The application of these Exos reduces the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes via the induction of cellular uptake. These features resulted in the reduction of fibrosis, infarct area, and vascularization [125]. In another study, NOX4 siRNA-loaded Exos were chemically decorated with cardiac targeting peptide. Data confirmed the modified Exos are valid delivery platform for the regulation of cardiac tissue fibrillation via the angiotensin system [126].",
        "Some fractions of internalized Exos are directed toward lysosomal degradation. It is thought that the application of specific modification strategies can help us to produce Exos with the potential to promote micropinocytosis, cytoplasmic release, and lysosomal degradation escape [104, 127]. Fabrication of arginine-rich peptides-decorated Exos increases the possibility of macropinocytosis [128]. For instance, decorating Exos with artificial leucine-zipper peptide (also known as K4) and E3 ubiquitin ligase induces cell uptake via micropinocytosis [128]. The application of fluorinated peptide dendrimers in the Exo structure increases the lysosomal escape and simultaneously increases the cytosolic release [129]. Besides, cationic lipids, pH-sensitive peptides can also be beneficial in Exo uptake and cytosolic release [130].",
        "Irrespective of the reparative properties of Exos in the alleviation of varied pathological conditions, several limitations restrict unhindered use of them in their human counterparts [131]. For instance, the development of ready-to-use and off-the-shelf Exo sources is mandatory for the application in the clinical setting [131]. Recent data have proved that storage temperature and pH changes can influence the integrity of Exos and EVs [132]. It has been shown that multiple freeze–thaw cycles can distort the physiochemical properties of Exos [132]. The metabolic status of parent (donor) cells is a crucial factor in the cargo composition of isolated Exos. Even though, stressful conditions and pro-inflammatory status change the cargo sorting and density of cytokines inside the Exos [133]. Another issue is related to the lack of standard protocols for the expansion of parent cells and large-sized isolation of Exos from biofluids with minimum damages and higher-rate purities [134]. Besides, the sterility protocols should be respected in the laboratory setting before the isolation of Exos. Due to the similarities in Exos and viral particle size, emerging data have shown that Exos shared common production pathways with viruses which per se can lead to the horizontal spreading of viral particles [25]. The possibility of unwanted side effects such as thrombosis with concomitant hemostatic perturbations remains challenging in allograft recipients [135]. The activation of allo-reactive T cell responses and rapid elimination by reticuloendothelial system cells can be disadvantages of Exo application [25]. Notably, the major hurdles that limit and slow down Exo-based therapies in human medicine are mainly associated with the non-developed GMP-grade isolation, purification, and preparation protocols for different regenerative purposes [131].",
        "Another question is whether Exos can exhibit independent bioactivities such as growth, and/or division with the right action under specific biological conditions remained unanswered. Along with the generation of Exos via the ESCRT-related axis, the exact mechanisms that orchestrated the production of Exos via ESCRT-independent pathways, i.e. ceramide-mediated activities have not been addressed and discovered [136]. Thus, further studies should focus on the addressing of exact Exo behavior under different situations. The story might be hard to interpret when because each Exo harbors both endogenous and exogenous genetic and protein contents [137]. Whether the time and scale dependence of different exosomal cargo types differ should be also answered in this regard. In a common belief, Exos can release their contents directly into the cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus or back-fusion with the endosomes or other intracellular compartments in the recipient cells [138, 139]. The surface molecular signature of Exos can stimulate specific plasma membrane proteins in the recipient cells which can pre-determine the fate and activity of Exos upon internalization [140]. Due to the complexity of the involved mechanisms and lack of enough knowledge, future studies should elucidate the underlying mechanisms in the direction of exosomal cargo into different subcellular components in the targeted cells.",
        "Although the number of clinical trials is low in humans it is thought that the application of Exos will be extended in the clinical setting due to several benefits compared to whole-cell-based therapies. By February 2025, the public clinical trial database https://clinicaltrials.gov presented 6 studies related to EVs in humans (Table 4). Based on several pre-clinical studies, the administration of naïve Exos can lead to the alleviation of pathological conditions after ischemic changes. The promotion of angiogenesis, cardiomyocyte proliferation, and the reduction of apoptotic changes can accelerate the healing of injured myocardium. Despite these advantages, off-target delivery is limited to the bulk application of Exos in MI patients especially via systemic routes. Thus, the naïve Exos can be engineered to increase the on-target delivery rate into the injured myocardium. It seems that with the progress in engineering methods, new engineered Exo products can be introduced for patients with ischemic changes and MI. Due to the lack of enough data related to the application of naïve and engineered Exos in clinical settings, any interpretation should be done with caution. Further clinical trials associated with different parent cells, purification methods, doses, preparation steps, loading techniques, etc. are mandatory to be applied to the MI patients according to the standard guidelines.Table 4List of EV studies in humans related to the cardiovascular system adapted from https://clinicaltrials.gov up to February 2025Study titleStudy StatusStudy ResultsConditionsInterventionsPhasesStudy typeTreatment of non-ischemic cardiomyopathies by intravenous EVs of cardiovascular progenitor cellsRecruitingNOHeart failure with reduced ejection fractionBiological: EV-enriched secretome of cardiovascular progenitor cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cellsPhase1InterventionalSalivary EV-associated lncRNAs in heart failure (seal-hf)RecruitingNOCHF/ADHF/Control–ObservationalEV microRNA profiling in congenital heart disease: fetal-maternal regulation in neonatal thrombosisRecruitingNOCongenital Heart Disease/Single-ventricle/ThrombosisOTHER: Collecting discarded blood samples–ObservationalSafety evaluation of intracoronary infusion of EV in patients following coronary stent implantationEnrolling by invitationNOPercutaneous Coronary InterventionDRUG: PEPPhase1InterventionalAntiplatelet therapy effect on EVs in acute myocardial infarctionCompletedYESMyocardial InfarctionDRUG: Ticagrelor/DRUG: ClopidogrelPhase4InterventionalSilent myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing non-oncological abdominal surgeriesRecruitingNOSilent Myocardial Ischemia/Acute Myocardial InfarctionGENETIC: Silent myocardial ischemia, STEMIObservational",

        "Acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) leads to cardiac remodeling and cardiomyocyte necrosis [66], which have emerged as unmet medical needs for the introduction of cardiac tissue repair after AMI [32]. Cardiac stem cells (CSCs), the promising cells in regenerative therapy, primarily act through paracrine mechanisms in post-AMI patients or hypoplastic left ventricle (LV) or dilated cardiomyopathy [55]. One type of CSCs population has been reported to display a mesenchymal cell-surface profile (CD34− and CD105+) [58], and it has been shown to express Bmi1 [76], capable of differentiating into cardiomyocytes, endothelial, and smooth muscle-like cells. When CSCs were injected into the infarcted myocardium of mice, rats, or pigs, the transplanted cells exerted the recovery of heart function [26, 37, 43, 52, 53, 88]. Their benefits include anti-fibrotic [89], anti-apoptotic [45], angiogenic [89], and anti-inflammatory effects [3]. With over 70 labs worldwide [2, 23, 59, 84, 101] and ten completed clinical trials [56], attest to their safety and potential disease-modifying effects in humans [50, 51, 54].",
        "A common method in the field involves the ex vivo expansion of resident CSCs, followed by their delivery to the heart, with cardiosphere (CS) being frequently utilized [75]. Although CS exhibit readily isolated properties and can be expanded ex vivo [75], the time-consuming nature of their isolation and expansion process for clinical implantation compromises their therapeutic benefits, potentially missing the optimal repair window for patients in need. Therefore, in addition to implantation, the induction of endogenous CSC (eCSC) activities could be a more efficient and protective strategy to improve therapeutic benefits by shorting the time for CSCs to initiate repair after AMI.",
        "Interleukin 22 (IL-22), belonging to the IL-10 cytokine family, interacts with the IL-22 receptor complex, including IL-22 receptor alpha 1 (IL-22R1 or IL-22RA1), to exert anti-inflammatory, tissue homeostatic, cell proliferative, and cytoprotective effects [47, 78, 79, 86, 98] through the cell surface receptors IL-10R2 and IL-22R1 [16, 40]. To date, evidence suggests that IL-22 promotes the proliferation and survival of several tissue stem cells. For example, the IL-22/IL-22R1 cascade exerts cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects to provide a signal for the survival and proliferation of intestinal stem cells and protects intestinal epithelium completeness during inflammatory bowel disease and experimental colitis [27, 78]. Increased expression of IL-22 is correlated with increased proliferation of liver progenitor cells (LPCs). IL-22 binding to IL-22R1 activates the signal transducer of STAT3 to regulate the proliferation and survival of LPCs to protect mice against various types of liver injuries by directly attenuating hepatocyte necrosis [21, 102]. Further, studies have shown that the IL-22/IL-22R1 pathway acts as a myocardium-protective cytokine in patients with viral myocarditis [39]. Based on the findings of these studies, we hypothesize that the IL-22/IL-22R1 axis exerts its myocardial repair function by enhancing eCSC activation after AMI.",
        "Recent studies have reported that IL-22 can ameliorate AMI [12, 82, 86] by activating the IL-22R1/STAT3 signaling pathway [82], blocking the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibiting ROS production as well as cytochrome C release [12] after ischemia–reperfusion injury. However, the regulatory effects of hypoxia on IL-22/IL-22R1 expression remains unknown. Previous studies have reported increased expression of IL-10 and IL-20, which is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activation, in patients with AMI [9, 13, 22]. Because IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 family, we hypothesize that AMI induces the upregulation of IL-22 and IL-22R1 by activating HIF-1α in the myocardium.",
        "This study investigated whether HIF-1α activation could activate the downstream biological response of the IL-22/IL-22R1 signaling pathway, with particularly focus on the self-renewal ability of eCSCs to attenuate left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, remodeling, and inflammation after AMI. RNA microarray analysis was performed to identify the candidate gene(s), such as Bmi1, involved in IL-22/IL-22R1 signaling, along with bioinformatics analysis. We speculated that the HIF-1α-activated IL-22/IL-22R1/Bmi1 cascade in eCSCs might offer a new therapeutic strategy for AMI via eCSC-induced cardiac repair. Such global and comprehensive investigations on eCSC activities for cardiac repair after AMI are urgently warranted for improving the clinical efficacy of AMI treatment strategies.",

To detect off-target mutations, genome-wide unbiased identification of double stranded breaks (DSBs; Genome-wide Unbiased Identifications of DSBs Evaluated by Sequencing, Joung Lab, USA) based on global capturing of DSBs introduced by RNA-guided endonucleases was applied to enable genome-wide profiling of off-target cleavage by CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and mitigate off-target effects [87]. Homozygote normal littermates and heterozygote newborns (IL-22R1+/–) were genotyped through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers [96].

A left thoracotomy was performed in the 4-5th intercostal space using a rib retractor (MY-9454 S, Japan). An intra-myocardial ligature was placed 1–2 mm below the atrioventricular groove using a 6-O polyethylene suture needle with thread (Ethicon, UK) before the thorax was closed. Sham rats or mice underwent the same protocol with the exception of the ligation of the coronary artery. After AMI at certain days, IL-22 (R&D, USA) and 2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME2, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) will be injected by subcutaneously and intraperitoneal injection, respectively.",

The rats in the sham group underwent the same procedure except for the LAD coronary artery ligation. Experimental design included that inflammatory response was assessed after 3 days, LV functional changes were assessed on 28 days, and structural remodeling was assessed at 28 days post-AMI.

The explants then were cultured in complete explant medium (CEM) (DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin G, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 0.1 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol) at 37 °C with a 95% air/5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. They were left undisturbed for 7–10 days to allow for migration of the cells from the explants and a layer of fibroblast-like cells was generated from adherent explants over which small, phase-bright cells migrated. These loose attached phase-bright cells obtained were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/mL in ultra-low attachment plates (Corning, Merck, Germany) in cardiosphere growth medium (CGM) (35% complete IMDM/65% DMEM–Ham F-12 mix containing 2% B27, 0.1 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 40 nmol/L cardiotrophin-1, 40 nmol/L thrombin, and antibiotics) to form primary cardiospheres (CSs) by sphere formation. The frequency of primary CSs formation was calculated by dividing the number of CSs by the number of total 1 × 104 seeding cells per 24-well each. The CS diameters were measured using a bright-field with confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM510) and image analysis software (minimum diameter > 50 μm, the images of five fields per well were obtained; Microcomputer Imaging Device Program, Canada). To form secondary CSs, primary CSs were dissociated into single cells by 0.05% trypsin/EDTA and re-seeded in ultra-low attachment plates with CGM. We quantified self-renewal potential by dividing the number of secondary CSs by the number of total 1 × 104 single-seeding cells dissociated from primary CSs.",

Hypoxic cultures were cultivated in a two-gas incubator (Jouan SA, France) equipped with an O2 probe to regulate N2 gas levels. Cell number and viability were evaluated using trypan blue exclusion assay.",
        "2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME2, Merck, Germany) was dissolved in DMSO to obtain a 10 mmol/L stock solution. For in vivo experiments, the whole procedure was performed as previously described [67].

For in vitro experiments with 2-ME2 treatment, PCCs were pretreated with different concentrations of 2-ME2 (0.1 µM, 1 µM and 10 µM) for 16 h as previously described [15].",
        "The lentiviral constructs were generated by co-transfection of human kidney derived 293T cells with three plasmids using the calcium phosphate method as previously described with modification [70].

Lentiviral vector particles were generated by transient co-transfection of 293T cells with the lentiviral shuttle plasmid from TRIP GFP plasmid vector [103], an HIV-1-derived packaging plasmid, and a VSV-G envelope expressing plasmid. Two days after transfection, lentiviral constructs (LV-IL-22R1, LV-HIF-1α, LV-HIF-2α or LV-GFP) were harvested in the culture medium and concentrated by ultra-centrifugation. Viral titers were quantified by using HIV-1 p24 antigen assay (Beckman Coulter, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The p24 concentration was used to determine the vector dose (expressed in nanograms) administered in the various in vitro and in vivo experiments. The lentiviral titers were determined by infection of 293T cells seeded in six-well plates at 1 × 105 cells per well the day before infection with serial dilution of the concentrated viral stock. After overnight incubation, the culture medium was changed and the cells incubated for two more days. GFP fluorescent cells were identified by a fluorescent activated cell sorter.

The binding of HIF-1α to the promoter of IL-22R1 (NCBI Accession number: NC_000001.11) was examined using a commercial kit for ChIP assay (Upstate Biotechnology, Millipore, Merck, USA) in accordance to the manufacturer’s protocol with minor modifications. DNA–protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with primary antibody against HIF-1α linked to protein A agarose beads, and eluted with 1% SDS, and 0.1 M NaHCO3. The cross-links were reversed by incubation at 650C for 5 h, and the proteins were removed with proteinase K.

In brief, 2D images of the left ventricle (LV) were obtained both in long and short axes at a frame rate of > 200/s. LV wall thickness, cavity dimensions both in systole (LV end-systolic diameter, LVESD), diastole (LV end-diastolic diameter, LVEDD), percentage of fractional shortening (FS) and percentage of ejection fraction (EF) were measured through the largest diameter of the ventricle by M-mode tracings with 2D guidance.",

The percentage of proliferating cells was counted by dividing the number of BrdU+ cells with the number of total nuclei.

        "To determine whether the expression of IL-22/IL-22R1 increased after AMI, we evaluated IL-22 and IL-22R1 levels in rat heart samples. Ischemic rat hearts were collected from the peri-infarcted region (border zone of the LV infarct). Samples from similar heart areas without left anterior descending coronary artery ligation were used as normal controls. ELISA revealed a significant increase in IL-22 levels in the ischemic heart compared with nonischemic controls (Fig. 1A). We observed that AMI increased the level of HIF-1α and IL-22R1 (Fig. 1B) in a time-dependent manner. Of note, the expression of IL-22R1 was observed not only in α-SA+ cardiomyocytes but also in stromal cells in heart by the results of immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of the ischemic heart (Fig. 1C).",
        "Next, to further verify whether hypoxia could enhance the expression of IL-22R1 in PCCs, PCCs were subjected to hypoxic treatment at various different oxygen levels (21%, 1%, 3%, and 5%) and times (1, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h) to identify the optimal conditions for investigating the association between hypoxia and IL-22R1 in vitro. The hypoxic concentrations were not aimed to simulate the oxygen levels of in vivo ischemia, but rather to determine the optimal hypoxic time and concentration for subsequent in vitro experiments regarding the molecular mechanism of IL-22R1 as previously described [33]. Compared with the control without hypoxia, the expression of IL-22R1 were significantly upregulated after hypoxia with higher at 3% O2 level (Fig. 1D) and with higher at 8 h (Fig. 1E), in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, respectively. Moreover, IL-22R1+ PCCs were co-expressed with specific cardiomyocyte markers for CD105 at 3% O2 level for 16 h (Figure S1). These findings indicate that hypoxia/ischemia can increase the expression of IL-22R1 in PCCs, and IL-22/IL-22R1 in hearts.",

        "To investigate whether the upregulation of IL-22R1 after AMI was mediated by HIF-1α activation, we used 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME2), an HIF-1α inhibitor, and HIF-1α−/− mice to assess IL-22R1 expression in the hearts of ischemic rats. Western blotting revealed a 2-ME2 dose-dependent decrease in the expression of IL-22R1 after AMI (Fig. 2A). The same phenomena were observed in the hearts of HIF-1α−/− mice, which did not exhibit IL-22R1 upregulation after induction of ischemia (Fig. 2B).",
        "To further explore the effects of HIF-1α activation on IL-22R1 expression, we examined the subcellular localization of HIF-1α and IL-22R1 in PCCs under hypoxic conditions. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α was localized both in the cytosol and nucleus and was coexpressed with IL-22R1. In contrast, under 3% O2 hypoxic conditions for 16 h, HIF-1α translocated to the nuclei or perinuclear areas (Figure S2). Pretreatment of PCCs with 2-ME2 (1 µM) for 16 h inhibited the translocation of HIF-1α to the nucleus (Figure S2). Interestingly, upregulation of HIF-1α and IL-22R1 required HIF-1α activation because both were inhibited after 2-ME2 pretreatment (pretreated for 16 h) of PCCs or HIF-1α knockdown using LV-HIF-1α-shRNA (Fig. 2C). We also observed that 2-ME2 specifically inhibited HIF-1α-induced IL-22R1 expression. However, 2-ME2 had no inhibitory effect on lentiviral-induced IL-22R1 (LV-IL-22R1) overexpression (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of HIF-1α activity, by blocking the nuclear translocation of HIF-1α, can downregulate the expression of IL-22R1 in ischemic hearts and PCCs.",
        "To prove that hypoxia-induced IL-22R1 upregulation occurs only via HIF-1α, we overexpressed HIF-1α (LV-HIF-1α) and HIF-2α (LV-HIF-2α) or knocked down HIF-1α (LV-HIF-1α-sh) and HIF-2α (LV-HIF-2α-sh) via lentiviral transduction. Knockdown of HIF-1α (LV-HIF-1α-sh) (Fig. 2E) or overexpression of HIF-1α (LV-HIF-1α) (Fig. 2F), but not knockdown of HIF-2α (LV-HIF-2α-sh) (Fig. 2E) after hypoxic treatment for 8 h [44] or overexpression of HIF-2α (LV-HIF-2α) (Fig. 2F), significantly modulated the expression of IL-22R1 in PCCs. To obtain direct evidence for the interaction between HIF-1α and the IL-22R1 promoter, we performed bioinformatics analysis to predict the molecular mechanism by which hypoxia induces IL-22R1 expression. We identified one putative HIF-1α-binding site (hypoxia response element, HRE) in the IL-22R1 promoter sequence from − 826 to − 821 (5′-ACGTG-3′) (Fig. 2G), suggesting that HIF-1α regulates IL-22R1 expression by directly binding to its promoter; this was further confirmed using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. The ChIP assay revealed the recruitment and direct binding of HIF-1α to the IL-22R1 promoter in PCCs subjected to 8 h of hypoxic treatment but not in those subjected to 4 h of normoxia and in those treated with LV-HIF-1α-shRNA and 4 h of hypoxia (Fig. 2H).",
        "To further determine whether the upregulation of IL-22R1 expression was a result of activated HIF-1α binding to the HRE on the IL-22R1 promoter, the luciferase promoter assay was performed using PCCs subjected to hypoxia. The activity of the luciferase reporter gene construct (pIL22R1-D2) containing HRE from the IL-22R1 gene promoter coupled to an SV40 promoter was much higher than that of a control construct (pIL22R1-D4) and an HRE-mutant construct (pIL22R1-D2mut) under hypoxia (Fig. 2I). Overall, our results indicate that hypoxia-induced IL-22R1 upregulation is mediated by HIF-1α-induced transcriptional activity.",

        "To determine that the IL-22/IL-22R1 signaling cascade plays a significant role in rescuing the heart from ischemic injury, we examined infarct size and LV function after AMI. First, greater infarct size was observed after AMI in IL-22R1−/− mice than in littermate (IL-22R1-NL) mice (Fig. 3A), indicating that loss of IL-22R1 signaling induced detrimental injury to the heart. Thus, to select the most effective treatment dosage of IL-22, rats were divided into four groups (rats with AMI treated with 0.5, 5, and 50 µg/kg IL-22 and saline control group). The infarct size of the 5 and 50 µg/kg IL-22-treated groups 28 days after AMI was much smaller than that of the control group (Fig. 3B-C). Further, the 5 and 50 µg/kg IL-22-treated groups showed significantly increased infarct wall thickness compared with the thin wall in the control group (Fig. 3B, D). M-mode echocardiography was performed to assess LV function 28 days after AMI. The 5 and 50 µg/kg IL-22-treated groups showed improved cardiac function with lower LVESD–LVEDD and higher FS–EF than the control group (Fig. 3E-F). There was no influence on the heart rates among the groups (data not shown). However, pretreatment of the 50 µg/kg IL-22-treated group with rIL-22BP-Fc abolished all the recovery parameters of LV function after AMI (Fig. 3E-F).",
        "Next, we observed that the grade of fibrosis was significantly increased in the left ventricle in trichrome–Masson (T–M)-stained sections compared with the sham 28 days after AMI (Fig. 3B, G; Figure S2A). Interestingly, compared with the saline control group, fibrosis was significantly reduced after AMI in the 5 and 50 µg/kg IL-22-treated groups (Fig. 3B, G). Because metalloprotease (MMP)-9 is a protein related to cardiac fibrosis after AMI [104], we performed gelatin in-gel zymography and found that MMP-9 activity was higher after AMI (Fig. 3H). Importantly, the 5 and 50 µg/kg IL-22-treated groups had a greater reduction in MMP-9 activity after AMI than the saline control group (Fig. 3H). In contrast, inhibition of the IL-22/IL-22R1 signaling cascade by rIL-22BP-Fc in the 50 µg/kg IL-22-treated group abolished the IL-22-mediated reduction in fibrosis and MMP-9 activity in the LV after AMI (Fig. 3H).",
        "To investigate whether IL-22/IL-22R1 signaling induces antiapoptotic effects, we performed the TUNEL assay to detect cardiac cell death 3 days (Figure S3) after AMI. Compared with treatment with saline, IL-22 treatment at dosages of 5 and 50 µg/kg significantly attenuated AMI-induced apoptotic cell death in the border zone of the LV infarct (Fig. 3I). In contrast, pretreatment of the 50 µg/kg IL-22-treated group with rIL-22BP-Fc reversed the IL-22-induced antiapoptotic effects 3 days after AMI (Fig. 3I).",

H&E staining revealed a significant reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration in the 5 and 50 µg/kg IL-22-treated groups compared with the saline control group (Figure S3C, Figure S4A). The 5 and 50 µg/kg IL-22-treated groups showed significantly fewer infiltrated CD68+ cells in the peri-infarct area 3 days after AMI than the saline control group (Figure S4B).

        "To determine whether the hypoxia cascade regulates the proliferation of CSCs, we examined the effect of the HIF-1α/IL-22R1 pathway on the self-renewal ability of CSCs. Hypoxia induction (3% O2 level for 8 h) increased the expression of IL-22R1 in CSCs (Figure S5). Immunocytochemical (ICC) analysis revealed that IL-22R1 was coexpressed with progenitor cell markers CD105 and proliferation markers (BrdU and Ki-67) in CSCs (Fig. 4A). Hypoxia with O2 level at 3% stimulated a significantly higher frequency of sphere formation (also in 5% O2 level), sphere size, and self-renewal potential than that with ordinary O2 level (21%) (Fig. 4B-C). However, knockdown using LV-HIF-1α-sh or LV-IL-22R1-sh (Figure S6) or using IL-22R1−/− mice abolished the proliferation and self-renewal effects of hypoxia on sphere formation in CSCs (Fig. 4C). In addition, hypoxic conditions significantly increased BrdU incorporation and Ki-67 immunostaining in the spheres compared with normoxic conditions (Fig. 4D). In contrast, enhancement of BrdU incorporation and Ki-67 immunostaining in CSCs was inhibited by the administration of LV-HIF-1α-sh or LV-IL-22R1-sh or by using the IL-22R1−/− mice (Fig. 4D).

        "To study the self-renewal potential of eCSCs after IL-22 treatment in vivo, we performed IHC analysis of CSCs in the peri-infarcted area of the rat heart. Three days after AMI, administration of IL-22 (50 µg/kg) resulted in a higher number of CD105+/BrdU+ (Fig. 5A), and CD105+/Ki-67+ (Fig. 5B) CSCs compared with treatment with the vehicle control in a time-dependent manner. Since Nkx2.5, abundantly expressed in CSCs [10], serves as the earliest marker of the cardiac lineage [10], it is crucial to further investigate whether the IL-22/IL-22R1 signaling cascade, regulating the proliferation of CD105+/Nkx2.5+ CSCs, significantly contributes to cardiac repair. We found that rIL-22BP-Fc injection (10 µg/kg, i.p.) abolished the IL-22-induced increase in the number of CD105+/Nkx2.5+ (Fig. 5C) CSCs in the ischemic heart 3 days after AMI.

        "To explore the downstream signaling mediators that regulate CSC proliferation, unbiased RNA microarray analysis was performed in CSCs for screening transcriptional expression, mimicked pathological AMI condition (IL-22 treatment under 3% O2 hypoxia for 8 h, recognized as hypoxia-IL-22, called H22) versus normal physiological condition (IL-22 treatment under normoxia, recognized as normoxia-IL-22, called N22). Under the screening criteria of |log2FC| ≥ 2 and p-value ≤ 0.05, 1000 transcripts were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 646 upregulated genes and 354 downregulated genes between the hypoxia-IL-22 versus normoxia-IL-22 CSC groups (Fig. 6A). We observed that compared with the normoxia-IL-22 group, the hypoxia-IL-22 group has increased expression of progenitor genes, such as CD105 (endoglin), and Sca-1 (Ly6a) (Fig. 6B). Downstream signaling mediator analysis revealed that the gene expression of CSC-related transcription factors, including Bmi1, Oct4 (Pou5f1), and Nkx2-5, was enhanced after hypoxia-IL-22 treatment than after normoxia-IL-22 treatment (Fig. 6C). Song et al. reported that Bmi1hi cardiac cells were enriched in cardiac stem/progenitor cells after AMI [76, 93]. However, whether CSCs express Bmi1 and if cardiac Bmi1 expression plays a role in the IL-22/IL-22R1 axis after AMI remains unclear. We found that the transcriptional expression of Bmi1 was significantly increased in the 100 µg/ml IL-22-treated CSCs after 8 h of hypoxia than in the normoxia-IL-22-treated CSCs (Fig. 6D). To study the role of Bmi1 in the self-renewal potential of eCSCs after IL-22 treatment in vivo, we performed IHC analysis of eCSCs in the peri-infarcted area of rat hearts. Analysis revealed that IL-22 administration (50 µg/kg) increased the numbers of CD105+/Bmi1+ eCSCs (Fig. 6E), which were reduced after rIL-22BP-Fc injection (10 µg/kg, i.p.), in the ischemic heart 3 days after AMI.

        "Therapeutic strategies targeting inflammatory responses, which are associated with proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 [63], promote cardiac remodeling after AMI [95]. In this study, we used recombinant IL-22 to inhibit inflammatory responses in the heart to study LV function and cardiac remodeling after AMI. We demonstrated that IL-22 administration can reduce myocardial inflammation and MMP-9 expression 3 days after AMI as well as attenuate LV dysfunction and remodeling, with its effects on fibrosis, 28 days after AMI. Additionally, 3 days after AMI, IL-22 blocked the increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells followed by significant infiltration of CD68-positive monocytes/macrophages in the border zone of the myocardium [81], which is associated with an increase in the mRNA expression of various proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ). The abovementioned effects after IL-22 treatment were abolished by the administration of rIL-22BP-Fc, an IL-22R1 inhibitor. Overall, these findings indicate that IL-22/IL-22R1 signaling markedly improves LV function and attenuates LV remodeling after AMI.",
        "IL-22, together with IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-24, and IL-26, belongs to the IL-10 family of cytokines [17]. Because monocytes, B cells, T cells, NK cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, and dendritic cells do not express IL-22R1, these immune cells are not the target of IL-22 [98]. Thus, IL-22 is an unusual interleukin; it activates cells of the skin and digestive and respiratory systems as well as those of the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and joints [64]. In our study, we identified the heart as another new target organ, which expresses IL-22R1 and could be regulated by IL-22 in vitro and in vivo. Regarding physiological function, besides the enhancement of innate defense mechanism [24, 80], induction of specific chemokines [4], and promotion of cellular mobility [5], IL-22 could also augment cellular proliferation [42] and inhibit differentiation [99]. Therefore, tissue-specific endogenous stem/progenitor cells probably contribute to the strong protective properties of IL-22 against damage in selected tissues such as the liver and intestine [21, 27]. Because of the high IL-22R1 expression in the liver and intestine, IL-22 strongly promotes liver stem cell proliferation and protects intestinal stem cells from inflammatory insults [21, 27]. In this study, we provided in vivo and in vitro evidence that IL-22 is also an important factor that promotes CSCs proliferation to repair ischemic injury after AMI. Cardiac IL-22 and IL-22R1 levels were markedly elevated in ischemic cardiomyocytes after AMI. Pharmacological inhibition using rIL-22BP-Fc and genetic knockdown of IL-22R1 via RNA interference blocked ischemia–hypoxia-induced proliferation and self-renewal of CSCs. These results indicate that IL-22/IL-22R1 signaling is essential for the self-renewal of CSCs in the ischemic heart.",
        "Various markers have been used to identify different populations of CSCs. Distinct groups have been classified based on stem cell markers and functional assays, such as Sca-1+ CSCs [57, 94], Islet-1+ CSCs [7, 61], and cardiosphere-derived cells [46, 75]. Previous studies have demonstrated that it was revealed that the adult heart contains a resident population of Bmi1-expressing progenitor cells (B-CPCs, Sca1+/c-kit−/Bmi1+) within the non-cardiomyocyte Sca-1+ fraction using a validated lineage tracing strategy to monitor Bmi1 locus activity [92]. These B-CPCs exhibit higher expression levels of various multipotency and stemness markers, and their numbers increase as the mouse ages. Throughout the whole life, B-CPCs significantly contribute to the formation of new cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Additionally, the research indicates that B-CPCs possess a stemness genetic profile, become activated, and supply the new generation of cardiomyocytes following AMI [93]. In the future, further research focusing on Bmi1CreER/+;Rosa26YFP/+ (Bmi1-YFP) mice would be worthwhile to provide in vivo evidence of the HIF-1α-activated IL-22/IL-22R signaling pathway in repairing ischemic heart after AMI by regulating and expanding Sca-1+ eCSC or B-CPC activation, as well as subsequent cardiomyocyte differentiation.",
        "According to previous studies on B-CPCs [92, 93], Bmi1 regulates cardiac progenitor differentiation through its antioxidant- and anticlastogenic-related functions [31]. They reported that oxidative stress disturbed Bmi1 function to induce deregulation of its downstream genes and leading to cardiac progenitor differentiation in vivo. Reduction of pathology-related ROS levels restored Bmi1’s epigenetic regulation ability in vivo. This correlation between oxidative stress and progenitor cell differentiation underscored ROS as a key regulator of adult cardiac progenitor turnover in vivo. In order to keep the homeostasis, there is an inverse relationship between levels of expression of Bmi1 and ROS level for governing the B-CPCs self-renewal. In response to oxidative damage in vivo, Bmi1 activity could be modified by derepressing canonical target genes in favor of it’s antioxidant and anticlastogenic functions to promote differentiation of cardiac progenitors even in a steady state. Therefore, ROS-associated differentiation of cardiac progenitors to the three main cardiac cell lineages would be robustly enhanced by severe ischemic damage (i.e., acute infarct, etc.). In this study, in-deep investigation would be need to understand how Bmi1 regulates cardiac progenitor differentiation through its antioxidant- and anticlastogenic-related functions within the HIF-1α-activated IL-22/IL-22R1 signaling pathway to regulate eCSC activation, protection, expansion, and their balanced differentiation.",
        "Self-renewal of adult stem cells is necessary for maintaining tissue development and resupplying the stem cell pool after organ injury [29]. Because HIFs activated after hypoxia may induce the expression of numerous gene products, including pluripotency-associated transcription factors (Oct-3/4, Nanog, and Sox-2) [25], hypoxia is known to facilitate an undifferentiated state in several stem and progenitor cell populations [1, 48, 60]. The signaling cascade and transcriptome activation in hypoxic conditions have been observed after different biological responses among specific stem/progenitor cell lineages; however, the direct effect of hypoxia on stem/progenitor cells has received little attention [73]. Regarding the proliferation machinery, the molecular mechanisms of self-renewal that allow stem/progenitor cells to maintain their pluripotency involve cytokines and growth factors such as SDF-1, IGF-1, and HGF [18, 85]. These factors are required for the modulation of self-renewal in several types of stem cells, including neural [38], hematopoietic [90], and cancer stem cells [30]. Importantly, these proliferation-inducing cytokines and growth factors are regulated by hypoxia via HIF-1α activation [11, 19, 20, 28, 72]. Moreover, some transcriptional regulators, such as Bmi1, have been demonstrated to play important roles in the self-renewal and maintenance of stemness of many tissue-specific stem/progenitor cells, including cardiac progenitor cells [31], neural progenitor cells [100], and intestinal stem cells [71]. Taken together, the relationship between HIF-1α activation during hypoxia and the expression of cytokines, growth factors, and transcriptional regulators facilitates the regulation of the stem/progenitor cell pool. In our study, we first demonstrated that the IL-22/IL22R1 signaling pathway was activated in cultured CSCs during hypoxia and in the ischemic heart. Activated HIF-1α under hypoxic conditions directly binds to the HRE in the promoter of IL-22R1 to activate its expression. Further, we observed that hypoxia-induced IL-22R1 overexpression stimulated CSC proliferation in cardiac sphere cultures and ischemic hearts. Moreover, activation of Bmi1 after the IL-22/IL22R1 cascade induced CSC self-renewal; this effect could be abolished in Bmi1 knockout mice. In summary, the HIF-1α-IL-22/IL-22R1/Bmi1 cascade might play an important role in the modulation of the CSC pool in the ischemic heart.",

    "title": "Wnt/beta-catenin-mediated signaling re-activates proliferation of matured cardiomyocytes. development of second heart field (SHF Isl1+) that gives rise to the anterior heart field (AHF) cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) for the formation of the right ventricle, outflow tract (OFT), and a portion of the inflow tract (IFT). During early cardiogenesis, these AHF CPCs reside within the pharyngeal mesoderm (PM) that provides a microenvironment for them to receive signals that direct their cell fates. Here, N-cadherin, which is weakly expressed by CPCs, plays a significant role by promoting the adhesion of CPCs within the AHF, regulating beta-catenin levels in the cytoplasm to maintain high Wnt signaling and cardioproliferation while also preventing the premature differentiation of CPCs. On the contrary, strong expression of N-cadherin observed throughout matured myocardium is associated with downregulation of Wnt signaling due to beta-catenin sequestration at the cell membrane, inhibiting cardioproliferation. As such, upregulation of Wnt signaling pathway to enhance cardiac tissue proliferation in mature cardiomyocytes can be explored as an interesting avenue for regenerative treatment to patients who have suffered from myocardial infarction. METHODS: To investigate if Wnt signaling is able to enhance cellular proliferation of matured cardiomyocytes, we treated cardiomyocytes isolated from adult mouse heart and both murine and human ES cell-derived matured cardiomyocytes with N-cadherin antibody or CHIR99021 GSK inhibitor in an attempt to increase levels of cytoplasmic beta-catenin. Immunostaining, western blot, and quantitative PCR for cell proliferation markers, cell cycling markers, and Wnt signaling pathway markers were used to quantitate re-activation of cardioproliferation and Wnt signaling. RESULTS: N-cadherin antibody treatment releases sequestered beta-catenin at N-cadherin-based adherens junction, resulting in an increased pool of cytoplasmic beta-catenin, similar in effect to CHIR99021 GSK inhibitor treatment. Both treatments therefore upregulate Wnt signaling successfully and result in significant increases in matured cardiomyocyte proliferation. CONCLUSION: Although both N-cadherin antibody and CHIR99021 treatment resulted in increased Wnt signaling and cardioproliferation, CHIR99021 was found to be the more effective treatment method for human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we propose that CHIR99021 could be a potential therapeutic option for myocardial infarction patients in need of regeneration of cardiac tissue.

      "title": "Wnt/β-catenin-mediated signaling re-activates proliferation of matured cardiomyocytes",
      "abstract": "Background The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in the development of second heart field (SHF Isl1+) that gives rise to the anterior heart field (AHF) cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) for the formation of the right ventricle, outflow tract (OFT), and a portion of the inflow tract (IFT). During early cardiogenesis, these AHF CPCs reside within the pharyngeal mesoderm (PM) that provides a microenvironment for them to receive signals that direct their cell fates. Here, N-cadherin, which is weakly expressed by CPCs, plays a significant role by promoting the adhesion of CPCs within the AHF, regulating β-catenin levels in the cytoplasm to maintain high Wnt signaling and cardioproliferation while also preventing the premature differentiation of CPCs. On the contrary, strong expression of N-cadherin observed throughout matured myocardium is associated with downregulation of Wnt signaling due to β-catenin sequestration at the cell membrane, inhibiting cardioproliferation. As such, upregulation of Wnt signaling pathway to enhance cardiac tissue proliferation in mature cardiomyocytes can be explored as an interesting avenue for regenerative treatment to patients who have suffered from myocardial infarction. Methods To investigate if Wnt signaling is able to enhance cellular proliferation of matured cardiomyocytes, we treated cardiomyocytes isolated from adult mouse heart and both murine and human ES cell-derived matured cardiomyocytes with N-cadherin antibody or CHIR99021 GSK inhibitor in an attempt to increase levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin. Immunostaining, western blot, and quantitative PCR for cell proliferation markers, cell cycling markers, and Wnt signaling pathway markers were used to quantitate re-activation of cardioproliferation and Wnt signaling. Results N-cadherin antibody treatment releases sequestered β-catenin at N-cadherin-based adherens junction, resulting in an increased pool of cytoplasmic β-catenin, similar in effect to CHIR99021 GSK inhibitor treatment. Both treatments therefore upregulate Wnt signaling successfully and result in significant increases in matured cardiomyocyte proliferation. Conclusion Although both N-cadherin antibody and CHIR99021 treatment resulted in increased Wnt signaling and cardioproliferation, CHIR99021 was found to be the more effective treatment method for human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we propose that CHIR99021 could be a potential therapeutic option for myocardial infarction patients in need of regeneration of cardiac tissue.

        "Cardiovascular disease is currently the leading cause of death globally and is expected to rise in future as the incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases associated to cardiovascular risk factors increases [1]. In conjunction with preventive medicine, cardiac regeneration therapy may therefore be the next best solution to overcome this problem. Efforts are now being focused on improving the efficiency of cardiomyocyte proliferation to preserve cardiac function after an injury [2–4]. Hence, understanding the mechanism of cardiovascular development that leads to cardiovascular proliferation is pivotal in the advancement of therapeutic approach aimed at cardiac pathology.",
        "The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in particular plays an important role in the development of second heart field (SHF Isl1+) that gives rise to the anterior heart field (AHF) cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) for the formation of right ventricle (RV), outflow tract (OFT) and portion of inflow tract (IFT) [5–9]. During early cardiogenesis, these AHF CPCs reside within the pharyngeal mesoderm (PM) that provides a microenvironment for them to receive inputs and direct their fate. N-cadherins are Ca2+ dependent transmembrane proteins that associate with cytoplasmic catenins, such as the Wnt signal transducer β-catenin, to form adherens junction protein complexes which enable intercellular adhesion while simultaneously sequestering β-catenin to the plasma membrane. Unbound β-catenin are able to undergo nuclear translocation, forming complexes with the TCF/LEF family of DNA binding proteins to activate downstream Wnt effector genes, consequently promoting cardioproliferation and preventing premature differentiation of CPCs [5]. As such, cadherins are generally treated as negative regulators of the Wnt signaling pathway. However, N-cadherin, although weakly expressed in AHF CPCs, play a significant role in their cell fate and development by promoting intercellular adhesion between AHF CPCs while also being crucial to maintain high Wnt signaling activity [5]. On the contrary, adult myocardium express N-cadherin strongly, and yet have low levels of Wnt signaling activity and regenerate at a very low frequency, with an estimated rate of 0.5–1% per year [10–12]. We therefore attempted to revert matured cardiomyocytes into a more proliferative state by activating high levels of Wnt signaling. We posit that N-cadherin expression is necessary to protect a cytoplasmic store of β-catenin from proteolytic degradation via the GSK ubiquitination complex. These stores result in high Wnt signaling in CPCs due to the presence of Wnt signaling ligands binding and releasing β-catenin, while in matured cardiomycytes, β-catenin is highly sequestered and do not contribute to Wnt signal transduction. These stores of β-catenin, if released and made available in matured cardiomyocytes, should be able to undergo nuclear translocation and activate Wnt signaling to promote cardioproliferation.",
        "In this study, we demonstrated that re-activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway can be achieved in matured mouse and human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes by using N-cadherin antibody or GSK inhibitor, CHIR99021, releasing sequestered β-catenin in the N-cadherin-based adherens junctions or by preventing the ubiquitination-degradation of β-catenin, respectively [13–15]. We further validated the mechanism, demonstrating the translocation of cytoplasmic β-catenin into the nuclei to re-activate Wnt signaling leading to cardioproliferation. This study has therefore provided an avenue for the expansion of matured cardiomyocytes in vitro and perhaps regenerative medicine through enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation to preserve cardiac function after myocardial injury.",
        "The human ES cell line (H7) was cultured in feeder-free condition on Matrigel (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The cells were maintained in mTeSR™1 medium (Stemcell Technologies) and passaged with collagenase IV (1 mg/ml) enzymatic treatment. To differentiate human ES cells towards cardiomyocytes, we adopted the protocol established by Lian et al. [16, 17]. The Cdh2 mouse knockout ES cells were cultured and differentiated towards cardiomyocytes as described by Soh et al. [5]. In this study, matured ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes were cultured for more than 2 months from the initial contraction to ensure sufficient cardiomyocyte maturation [18].",
        "Single-cell suspension was obtained from cardiomyocytes derived from both murine and human ES cells. The cells were stained using vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) and SIRPα/β antibodies, respectively. Briefly, staining of mouse cardiomyocytes was achieved with rabbit anti-VCAM1 monoclonal antibody (1:50) (Cell Signaling Technologies) in the presence of blocking buffer consisting of 5% FBS and 2% BSA in PBS for 90 min at 37 °C, followed by donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594 at 1:1000 dilution (Invitrogen) for 1 h. Human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes, on the other hand, were stained with PE/Cy7-conjugated anti-human CD172a/b (SIRPα/β) antibody at 1:300 dilution (Biolegend). Cardiomyocytes were subsequently purified via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Matured human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes were treated with either 100 μM of TBP or 100 nmol/L of EDN1 to induce cardiac hypertrophy.",
        "Matured cardiomyocytes were isolated from mice that are at least 2 months old according to published protocol [19]. The isolated cardiomyocytes were maintained in medium comprising of RPMI and B27 supplement [16].",
        "For cultured cell samples, 2 × 106 cells were harvested and lysed in 800 μl of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The samples were allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature, after which 160 μl of chlorofoam was added to allow for phase separation by centrifugation at 12,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Following that, the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube, and equal volume of isopropanol was added and mixed. RNA samples were allowed to precipitate at room temperature for another 10 min. The precipitated RNA samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C. For cDNA synthesis, RNA samples (500 ng) were reverse transcribed to obtain cDNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (BioRad). Primer sequences are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. Quantitative PCR analyses were performed using SYBR Green Master Mix Reagent (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI Viia7 Real-Time PCR System. The threshold cycle (Ct) was determined to be ≥ 35. Each experiment was repeated at least twice. Standard deviations (s.d.) of the means in qPCR experiments were obtained from three independent experiments.",
        "Immunocytochemical analysis was performed using the respective antibodies: mouse anti-PY654-β-catenin (membrane bound) and anti-PY489-β-catenin (nuclear) (both from Hybridoma bank) and mouse anti-cardiac troponin T (1:400; Abcam ab8295). Briefly, cells were first harvested and washed once with PBS. Fixation of cells was achieved with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by treatment with 0.3% Triton X to permeabilize cells, if necessary. The cells were then blocked with PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were added at respective dilutions and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the cells were incubated for another 45 min at room temperature without light exposure with either 1:1000 diluted Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamindino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon TS-100).",
        "Fluorescent images were acquired by an automated microscope (PerkinElmer Operetta) at ×20 magnification. Image analysis was performed using the Columbus software (PerkinElmer), by first recognizing and outlining cellular nuclei based on DAPI staining. For each experiment, equal number of SIRPA-positive cardiomyocytes (1 × 105 cells) was seeded to compare proliferation of treated cells (N-cadherin antibody or CHIR99021) vs control (untreated). Quantification of cardiomyocytes was performed by summing all cardiac troponin T (cTnT)-positive cells (relative cutoff intensity > 150) in the treated wells vs the control. For the analysis on cardiomyocyte proliferation, the double-positive cells (Ki67+/cTnT+ or BrdU+/cTnT+) in each of the treatment conditions have been calculated as a percentage of all the single-positive cells (cTnT+).",
        "Whole-cell lysates were generated by scraping cultures of matured cardiomyocytes treated with CHIR99021, N-cadherin antibody, or combination for 1 day and resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 M NaCl, and 1 M Tris pH 7.4) for 10 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 11,400g for 20 min at 4 °C for the isolation of the cytosolic fractions. Quantification of protein concentration was determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo-scientific). Protein lysate of 60 μg per sample was loaded onto 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free Precast Gels (Bio-Rad), resolved by electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBS + 1% Tween-20 and probed overnight with primary antibodies. The antibodies were rabbit anti-β-catenin antibody (1:2500; Abcam ab32572) and mouse anti-β-actin antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling). Membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h with their respective IgG-HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz) in 5% skimmed milk in TBS + 1% Tween-20 and developed using ECL substrate (Bio-Rad).",
        "Results involving two experimental groups expressed as mean ± s.d. were tested for statistical significance using Student’s t test, two-sided based on assumed normal distributions. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The error bars in graphs with three or more experimental groups refer to standard error of means of stated replicates. A non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance) was used to assess whether the mean values of the experimental groups could be considered to be significantly different compared to the control group at 95% confidence level.",
        "Earlier data demonstrated that the loss of N-cadherin seen in AHF-Cre; Cdh2fl/fl mutant mice embryo causes lower levels of both membrane and nuclear β-catenin due to cytoplasmic degradation of β-catenin. Resultant downregulation of Wnt signaling led to the decrease in proliferation of CPCs, premature differentiation of AHF CPC to cardiomyocytes in the pharyngeal mesoderm, and disrupted growth of the OFT and RV [5]. As N-cadherin was found to be weakly expressed in proliferative CPCs and highly expressed in less proliferative cardiomyocytes, we therefore hypothesized that N-cadherin expression plays an important role in regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway for proliferation and regeneration in mature cardiomyocytes. To test this hypothesis, we sought to re-activate Wnt signaling in matured mouse cardiomyocytes and assess their proliferation capabilities. Immunostaining for BrdU, a proliferation marker, was performed to assess proliferation of matured mouse cTnT+ cardiomyocytes. To affect availability of cytoplasmic β-catenin for nuclear translocation, we treated mouse cardiomyocytes with either N-cadherin antibody, which could potentially mimic Wnt signaling ligand binding or destabilize the adherens junction for the release of β-catenin, or CHIR99021, a GSK inhibitor. The results showed that more BrdU and cTnT double-positive cells were found in cardiomyocytes of either treatment, suggesting that upregulation of Wnt signaling via cytoplasmic β-catenin availability is able to enhance proliferation in matured mouse cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1a, b). These results were validated by quantitative PCR, whereby the cyclin genes known for their roles in cell cycle such as CDK1, CCNA2, CCNB1, and CCNB2 were observed to be significantly upregulated in both N-cadherin antibody- and CHIR99021-treated cardiomyocytes, suggesting that both treatments successfully increased cytoplasmic β-catenin levels, reactivate Wnt signaling, and result in the matured mouse cardiomyocytes entering a more proliferative state (Fig. 1c).Fig. 1Re-activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling increases matured mouse cardiomyocyte proliferation. a Representative images of untreated control and treated matured mouse cardiomyocytes with either N-cadherin antibody (1:1000) or CHIR99021 (1 μM) immunostained for BrdU (red) and cTnT (green); BrdU and cTnT double-positive cells are marked by white arrows.

        "While previous studies have reported that cadherins generally function as a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling due to their role in sequestering cytoplasmic β-catenin at the cell membrane, they also play an important role in Wnt/β-catenin signaling during development [5, 20]. We investigated the changes of cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin levels after treatment with N-cadherin antibody to uncover the interaction between N-cadherin-based adherens junctions and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Immunostaining results and quantification of N-cadherin antibody-treated matured cardiomyocytes showed lower levels of membrane β-catenin but higher levels of nuclear β-catenin as compared to control (Fig. 2a–d). These results confirmed that there was translocation of β-catenin from the membrane to the nucleus upon treatment with N-cadherin antibody. We reasoned that N-cadherin antibody neutralizes N-cadherin signaling, preventing their ability to sequester β-catenin at the cell membrane which consequently leads to the release of membrane-bound β-catenin, resulting in larger reservoir of cytoplasmic β-catenin that undergoes nuclear translocation to activate Wnt signaling. Quantitative PCR results of these N-cadherin antibody-treated cardiomyocytes showed that many Wnt signaling-related genes were upregulated (Fig. 2e). We figured that treatment with GSK inhibitor, CHIR99021, should achieve Wnt activation through the same pathway due to the increased availability of cytoplasmic β-catenin levels. Therefore, we performed quantitative PCR on matured cardiomyocytes treated with N-cadherin antibody and the GSK inhibitor, CHIR99021, and observed upregulation of the main Wnt signaling effectors, Axin2 and Lef1 (Fig. 2f). Taken together, these results prove that neutralizing N-cadherin signaling results in high levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin for nuclear translocation to promote the re-activation of Wnt signaling in matured cardiomyocytes.Fig. 2Neutralizing N-cadherin signaling results in translocation of β-catenin to the cell nuclei.

        "To further support our hypothesis that neutralizing N-cadherin signaling results in increased proliferative capacity of matured mouse cardiomyocyte through the re-activation of Wnt signaling, we treated N-cadherin knockout mouse ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes with N-cadherin antibody or CHIR99021. The mouse ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes were first purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on their expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (V-CAM1) [21] (Fig. 3a); thereafter, the cardiomyocyte numbers between treatments and the control were compared (Fig. 3b). Significant increase in numbers of cardiomyocytes was observed only for CHIR99021 treatment, compared to the control, and as expected, N-cadherin antibody failed to have significant effects on cardiomyocytes derived from Cdh2 knockout mouse ES cells. This result supports our earlier hypothesis that cardiomyocyte proliferation through N-cadherin antibody treatment was due to the release of sequestered β-catenin at the cell membrane, which undergoes nuclear translocation to activate Wnt signaling. Consistent with the above data regarding increased cell numbers and proliferation, we observed upregulation of genes involved in cell cycling (Ccnb1, Ccnb2, and Ccnd2) and Wnt signaling (Wnt1, Wnt2, Wnt6, Axin2, and Lef1) in CHIR99021-treated cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3c, d). While Ccnd2 activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition, the family of cyclin B genes are essential mediators of cell cycle progression in the G2-M phase transition and promotes cell proliferation [22, 23]. In contrast, cell cycling genes were not significantly upregulated in N-cadherin antibody-treated cardiomyocytes. As cardiomyocytes derived from Cdh2 knockout mouse ES cells do not form N-cadherin-based adherens junctions, our results confirm that N-cadherin antibody is only able to activate Wnt signaling and proliferation through interactions with N-cadherin.Fig. 3Cell proliferation only observed in CHIR99021-treated cardiomyocytes derived from cdh2−/− mouse ES cells. a Representative FACS plots illustrating purification of VCAM-1-positive mouse cardiomyocytes. b Graphical representation showing fold change in cardiomyocytes proliferation in untreated control and cardiomyocytes treated with N-cadherin antibody (1:1000) or CHIR99021 (1 μM) normalized to control.

        "To assess possible applications for regenerative medicine in humans, we generated human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes to investigate if induced proliferative effects observed in the mouse model could be replicated in human cell models. To ensure that the human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes used expressed a matured phenotype sufficient to model adult cardiomyocytes, the cardiomyocytes used in this study were cultured for at least 2 months post-initial contraction [18]. We performed gene expression analysis on cardiomyocytes, which were cultured for up to 1 month post-initial contraction. The results revealed downregulation of early key transcription factors governing cardiogenesis such as NKX2.5 and MEF2C and upregulation of cardiac maturation and ion channel markers such as MYH7, KCNQ1, SCN5A, HCN4, and CACNA1G at the end of the time-course experiment (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, consistent with other studies [18, 24], a concomitant shift in metabolism from glycolysis to β-oxidation was observed as the differentiated cardiomyocyte matures (Fig. 4b). Therefore, we concluded that the cultured cardiomyocytes used, 2 months post-initial contraction, are sufficiently mature to model adult cardiomyocytes.Fig. 4Quantitative PCR analysis of mRNA isolated from cardiomyocytes at various time points post-initial contraction (1, 2, and 4 weeks).

        "To investigate if the enhanced proliferative effect induced by upregulation of Wnt signaling could be replicated in adult human cardiomyocytes, we treated human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes with N-cadherin antibody and CHIR99021 and immunostained for Ki67 as the marker for cellular proliferation. Initial testing with N-cadherin antibody (1:1000) showed promising results, with quantification of immunostaining results showing ~ 1.0-fold increase in Ki67+ population of cells in the cultured human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes compared to a non-treated control (Fig. 4c–e). Thereafter, we varied concentrations of N-cadherin antibody and CHIR99021 to determine the optimal concentrations of both treatments that would result in the highest increase in Ki67+ population within the cardiomyocytes (Additional file 1: Figure S1A-B). The optimal concentrations were determined to be 1:1000 N-cadherin antibody and 1 μM CHIR99021, with further increased concentrations of either resulting in decreased cellular proliferation or increased cell death respectively (data not shown). Consistent with the effects of CHIR99021, quantitative PCR results showed that different concentrations of the GSK inhibitor do not significantly affect transcription of CDH2 or CTNNB1, genes that are upstream of β-catenin signaling. On the other hand, dose-dependent upregulation of both downstream effectors AXIN2 and LEF1 was observed (Additional file 1: Figure S1C).",
        "We then investigated if there are synergistic effects between N-cadherin antibody and CHIR99021 treatments. Immunostaining for Ki67+ and quantitative analysis on day 7 after treatment revealed that a combinatory treatment of N-cadherin antibody (1:1000) and CHIR99021 (1 μM) resulted in cardiomyocyte proliferation rates at an average between the more effective CHIR99021 treatment and the less effective N-cadherin antibody treatment (Fig. 5a–e). N-cadherin antibody treatment and CHIR99021 treatment resulted in a ~ 40% and ~ 100% increase in cardiomyocytes expressing the proliferation marker respectively, while the combinatory treatment resulted in a ~ 50% increase (Fig. 5b, c). Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis revealed that N-cadherin antibody and CHIR99021 both resulted in an increase in total cardiomyocyte number in culture compared to the control treatment, with the combinatory treatment also resulting in an average between the two treatments (Fig. 5d, e).Fig. 5Wnt signaling activated proliferation variations between treatments of antibody, small molecule, or both. a Representative images of untreated human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes (control) and treated human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes with either N-cadherin antibody (1:1000), CHIR99021 (1 μM), or combinations of both N-cadherin antibody and CHIR99021 (1:1000; 1 μM) stained for cTnT (green) and Ki67 (red).

        "In order to demonstrate a direct correlation between unbound β-catenin in the cytosolic fraction with cardiomyocyte proliferation, we performed western blot on cytosolic fractions of control cardiomyocytes and cells treated with CHIR99021, N-cadherin antibody, or combinatory treatment for 1 day. Longer treatment duration was not preferred in this case as the release of membrane-bound β-catenin after treatment with N-cadherin antibody would not be observed if the lysates were collected at a later time point. Consistent with the results thus far, increased levels of unbound β-catenin compared to the control were observed after 1 day of treatment (Fig. 5f). As illustrated by the western blot results, stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin via CHIR99021 treatment results in its slow build-up for nuclear translocation, but the majority will still be sequestered at the plasma membrane due to high N-cadherin levels in matured cardiomyocytes. As expected, N-cadherin antibody treatment which acts as a ligand releases the larger pool of β-catenin observed (Fig. 5f), which is still susceptible to GSK-tagged degradation, possibly explaining the more significant upregulation of Wnt signaling effects from CHIR99021 treatment due to inactivated GSK. Finally, a dual treatment of CHIR99021 and N-cadherin antibody would therefore result in an even larger increase in cytoplasmic β-catenin, as the protein is both being released from the plasma membrane and being stabilized in the cytoplasm.",
        "In addition to the upregulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin, more cardiomyocytes were stained positive for PHH3 and Survivin, a marker specific for G2-M phase that marks entry into the mitotic process and eventual division, when the cells were treated with CHIR99021 (Fig. 5g). All these results taken together suggest that both N-cadherin antibody and CHIR99021 induce dose-dependent cardiac proliferation through Wnt signaling and can possibly be used to revert mature human cardiomyocytes into a more proliferative state, up to a maximal dosage.",
        "Despite that, we reasoned that excessive amounts of N-cadherin antibody hindered the formation of adherens junctions, inhibiting cell adhesion between cardiomyocytes leading to the loss of cardiomyocytes and inefficient proliferation. Sufficient amounts of free N-cadherin are required for proper cardiomyocyte proliferation, adhesion, and overall cardiac function. Similarly, we reasoned that high concentrations of CHIR99021 are cytotoxic due to the pleiotropic effects of GSK inhibitor which affects several other pathways. Overall, CHIR99021 at its optimal concentration exhibits the best potential as a therapeutic agent for cardiac regeneration as it promotes the maximal re-activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling for cardiomyocyte proliferation without disrupting the necessary role of N-cadherin in cellular adhesion or inducing cytotoxicity.",
        "Many known cardiopathies and injuries affect mainly the ventricles, causing inflammatory responses leading to scarring, fibrosis, and hypertrophy of the mammalian heart, referred to as ventricular remodeling. Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in cardiac remodeling regulation as an injury response. In the mouse model, numerous works have suggested Wnt/β-catenin signaling to play a part in regulating cardiac hypertrophy and preventing apoptosis. However, there has been little evidence uncovering the mechanisms and pathways involved. Wnt ligands have been shown to be upregulated alongside their feedback regulators Dkk1 and Dkk2 as a response in mouse models with induced cardiac injuries such as myocardial infarction [25–27].",
        "In the current revision, we utilized human matured cardiomyocytes modeling cardiac injury to uncover how Wnt signaling is affected by cardiac injury. Cardiac hypertrophy has been induced as a form of heart injury in both animal and human models using oxidative stress treatments [28, 29]. Tert-butyl peroxide (TBP) is an oxidizing agent, commonly used as an alternative to hydrogen peroxide in stimulating oxidative stress in cells and tissues, while Endothelin-1 (EDN1) can result in cardiovascular fibrosis and hypertrophy due to increased collagen synthesis and reduced collagenase activity in cardiac fibroblasts [30, 31]. We treated human matured cardiomyocytes with either Endothelin-1 (EDN1) or Tert-butyl peroxide (TBP) to model cardiac injury and looked at changes in the transcript levels of CDH2, CTNNB1, AXIN2, and LEF1, effectors within the Wnt pathway (Additional file 1: Figure S2).",
        "From the results, we observed that cardiomyocytes treated with EDN1 or TBP expressed reduced levels of CDH2 transcription by ~ 0.5-fold while CTNNB1 expression increased by ~ 2-fold. We hypothesize that diseased cells are undergoing a phenomena of dedifferentiation, thereby reducing surface N-cadherin and cell-cell contact and proliferation in an attempt to repopulate after cardiac injury. Dedifferentiation of cardiomyocytes for proliferation was first shown to occur in the naturally regenerating Zebrafish heart [32]. Several other researchers have also observed dedifferentiation when regeneration is induced in other models [33, 34]. We further investigated AXIN2 and LEF1 expression levels to understand this phenomena. AXIN2, being an immediate downstream target of β-catenin, shows a similar upregulation pattern to CTNNB1 and serves as a negative feedback regulator of β-catenin. Interestingly, LEF1, the effector of proliferation signaling, is significantly downregulated upon TBP or EDN1 treatment. These results indicate that injured cardiomyocytes do not have a proliferative response despite the Wnt signaling received, suggesting that the upregulation of Wnt signaling via CHIR99021 treatment immediately after injury induced by ROS or EDN-1 may not result in cardiac regeneration in vivo. Nonetheless, CHIR99021 can be used in combination with simvastatin that has recently demonstrated to inhibit neural cell apoptosis and promote locomotor recovery via activation of Wnt signaling pathway by enhancing Lef1 expression after spinal cord injury [35].",
        "Previous studies have shown that sustaining high Wnt signaling activity in AHF CPCs during early cardiogenesis promotes proliferation and prevents premature differentiation of CPC [5]. In this study, we further document the mechanism for the re-activation of quiescent Wnt signaling in matured mouse and human cardiomyocytes that leads to cardioproliferation by maintaining high levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin for nuclear translocation using N-cadherin antibody and GSK inhibitor, CHIR99021 (Fig. 6). Earlier studies have reported that N-cadherin sequesters cytoplasmic β-catenin at the cell membrane, preventing its proteolytic degradation by the proteasome complex while simultaneously preventing the β-catenin from exerting its Wnt signaling effect through nuclear translocation [5]. We demonstrated that neutralizing N-cadherin signaling results in an effect similar to Wnt ligand binding and release of membrane-bound β-catenin, causing an increase in Wnt signaling. Although cadherins generally function as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, they play a crucial role in protecting a cytoplasmic store of β-catenin from proteolytic degradation which can be released upon Wnt ligand binding to activate the Wnt pathway. Confirmatory treatment of cardiomyocytes derived from Cdh2 knockout mouse ES cells with N-cadherin antibody validated that the Wnt signaling upregulation in wild-type mouse treatments was solely due to the release of β-catenin sequestered and protected by proteolytic degradation by N-cadherin. However, it is important to note that N-cadherin also plays a role in cell adhesion which is essential in determining the cardioproliferation efficiency. We observed that concentrations of N-cadherin antibody beyond 1:1000 were less effective in inducing cardioproliferation as they cause cells to detach from each other leading to the loss of cardiomyocytes and inhibition of cell-cell adhesion necessary for proliferation.Fig. 6Schematic illustration of the mechanisms of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in untreated and treated (N-cadherin/CHIR99021) matured cardiomyocytes. a In untreated matured cardiomyocytes, the N-cadherin regulates the Wnt signaling by binding and sequestering cytoplasmic β-catenin at the cell membrane, hence reducing the amount of unbound cytoplasmic β-catenin that can be translocated into the nucleus. In addition, cytoplasmic β-catenin is also regulated by destruction complex, which will phosphorylate cytoplasmic β-catenin and targets it for ubiquitination and proteolysis. b Neutralizing N-cadherin signaling by N-cadherin antibody prevents the sequestration of β-catenin at the cell membrane which consequently leads to the release of membrane-bound β-catenin, resulting in a larger reservoir of cytoplasmic β-catenin that gets translocated into the nucleus to activate Wnt signaling for cardioproliferation. However, the function of N-cadherin in cell adherence is also disrupted by N-cadherin antibody treatment. c GSK inhibitor, CHIR99021, inhibits the function of β-catenin destruction complex and thus prevents the degradation of cytoplasmic β-catenin, resulting in a larger reservoir of cytoplasmic β-catenin that gets translocated into the nucleus to activate Wnt signaling for cardioproliferation. Note that CHIR99021 treatment does not affect cell adhesion, an important factor in cardioproliferation",

Note that CHIR99021 treatment does not affect cell adhesion, an important factor in cardioproliferation",
        "While β-catenin/Wnt signaling is one such pathway that the cadherins regulate, there are several other proliferative and survival pathways that require N-cadherin/adherens junctions-mediated cell-cell adhesion. For instance, cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact is necessary for mechanical coupling between cells to activate mechanical signaling through both the actomyosin cytoskeleton and microtubule networks, shown to be crucial for cell division and transcriptional regulation [36, 37]. The closely related Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways have also been shown to be regulated by N-cadherins in neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Notch1 and its ligand Dll1, distributed around adherens junctions, determine the apical polarity and guide asymmetric neurogenic division for NPCs and their differentiated progenies [38]. Alpha-catenin, which is also sequestered at the adherens junction, highly upregulates Hedgehog signaling leading to excessive NPC proliferation when deleted [39]. In skin tissue, α-catenin tightly regulates the activity of YAP1, the transcriptional effector of the Hippo pathway, which controls epidermal stem cell proliferation and tissue expansion [40]. Additionally, endothelial cells maintain cell-cell contact through molecular players such as the cadherins and gap junctions and have been shown to increase cell proliferation via PI3K-dependent signaling pathway [41]. In matured myocardium, continuous expression of N-cadherin is essential for normal cardiac electrophysiological activity due to their functions in gap junctions [42].",
        "In our study, we demonstrated that CHIR99021 treatment exhibited the best potential for cardiac regeneration as it is not only more efficient in inducing cardioproliferation, it also does not interfere with the function of N-cadherin required for cell adhesion and cardiac electrophysiological activity [42]. Consistent with this, recent studies have demonstrated that CHIR99021 alone can promote cardiomyocyte proliferation in neonatal atrial human cardiomyocytes [43], emphasizing again the feasibility of using CHIR99021 as a potential drug that can endogenously repair injured cardiac tissue and promote cardiac regeneration. We found that CHIR99021 exhibits cytotoxic effects at a concentration of more than 1 μM, plausibly due to several reasons which were not uncovered in this study. GSK functions in several intracellular signaling pathways which result in CHIR99021, a GSK inhibitor to have several reported pleiotropic effects. One such pathway affected would be the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB which leads to the activation of lysosomal/autophagy pathway, stimulating lysosomal biogenesis resulting in GSK inhibitor-induced apoptosis [44–46]. High concentrations of GSK inhibitor were also reported to cause centrosome aberrations, deformation in mitotic spindles, chromosome instability, and subsequently cell death from mitotic catastrophe [47].",
        "While re-activation of Wnt signaling by CHIR99021 induces cardioproliferation required for cardiac regeneration, unregulated activation of Wnt signaling has been associated with many cardiac diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy and even cancer [48, 49]. While activated Wnt signaling can be useful in promoting cell proliferation, studies have also shown that constitutively activated β-catenin can result in the hyperactivation of Wnt signaling. Conditional inactivation of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) which forms part of the β-catenin destruction complex and increased expression of β-catenin/Lef-1 fusion protein can lead to cell death by apoptosis in mammalian intestinal epithelia [50–52]. Collectively, the results from the usage of different concentrations of N-cadherin antibody and CHIR99021 observed in our experiment support the evidence that the cellular responses to Wnt/β-catenin signaling is dosage dependent [53, 54]. Apart from that, several other studies have also reported that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling has directional and graded activity across the ventricular wall to regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation, with decreasing gradient from the outer to the inner myocardium [9, 55–57]. Therefore, it is important to consider the spatiotemporal pattern of Wnt/β-catenin signaling when testing potential therapeutic agents such as CHIR99021 to improve cardiomyocyte proliferation in the future.",
        "The current study focuses on laying the groundwork for the use of matured cardiomyocytes that were expanded in vitro for cell-based therapy. While the data showcases evidences that suggest plausible application for CHIR99021 to be utilized directly as an in vivo therapy for heart regeneration by stimulating endogenous cardiomyocytes to proliferate, we found it unwise due to reports of uncontrolled activation of the Wnt pathway causing potential deleterious and cancerous effects [48–51]. Until we can sustainably release CHIR99021 in a controlled and targeted manner in an injured heart, it would be challenging to demonstrate application of the findings in vivo.",
        "We have demonstrated in this study that activating Wnt signaling pathway by availing cytoplasmic β-catenin for nuclear translocation can enhance proliferation of matured cardiomyocytes. More importantly, we revealed that CHIR99021 is a promising candidate for the in vitro expansion of matured cardiomyocytes. The current study also provided evidence of dosage-dependent cellular responses to Wnt/β-catenin signaling using N-cadherin antibody and CHIR99021, providing a plausible avenue in the near future to activate Wnt signaling for endogenous cardiac regeneration using activators of canonical Wnt signaling pathway.",

    "title": "A brief review: the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in myocardial infarction. cardiomyocytes and is among the most serious health threats today. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), with their capacity for multidirectional differentiation, low immunogenicity, and high portability, can serve as ideal seed cells in cardiovascular disease therapy. In this review, we examine recent literature concerning the application of BMSCs for the treatment of MI and consider the following aspects: activity of transplanted cells, migration and homing of BMSCs, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of BMSCs, anti-fibrotic activity of BMSCs, the role of BMSCs in angiogenesis, and differentiation of BMSCs into cardiomyocyte-like cells and endothelial cells. Each aspect is complementary to the others and together they promote the repair of cardiomyocytes by BMSCs after MI. Although transplantation of BMSCs has enabled new options for MI treatment, the critical issue we must now address is the reduced viability of transplanted BMSCs due to inadequate blood supply, poor nourishment of cells, and generation of free radicals. More clinical trials are needed to prove the therapeutic potential of BMSCs in MI. China Medical University, Chongshandong Street No.4, Shenyang, 110032, China.

        "Cardiovascular disease is a major problem harmful to human health worldwide due to its high incidence. In the event of acute myocardial infarction (MI) or other heart diseases, the number of surviving cardiocytes declines. With the formation of fibrous cicatricial tissue and remodeling of ventricular tissue after MI, the contraction ability of the myocardium declines. Eventually, the decline in cardiac function may induce the reoccurrence of heart failure as a further threat to life. Although thrombolysis, coronary implantation of stents, and coronary artery bypass grafting have been used to treat MI clinically, these methods cannot reverse the damage to infarcted myocardium or improve heart function fundamentally. Finding a method to improve cardiac function through regeneration of damaged and nonfunctioning myocardium has therefore become a new direction for research. In recent decades, scientists have exerted great effort and energy into the use of stem cells to repair damaged myocardium and restore cardiac function. Currently, transplantation of exogenous stem cells into infarcted myocardium is regarded as a promising route for treating MI. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have emerged as the primary research focus among all of the various types of stem cells examined. A recent study has shown that pharmacological activation of the exchange protein directly activated by the cAMP (Epac)/Rap1 signaling pathway improved cardiac function through better survival, adhesion, and differentiation of transplanted BMSCs in rat [1]. A further study demonstrated that BMSCs preconditioned with 2,4-dinitrophenol improved cardiac function after transplantation, which was attributed to the improvement of survival, homing, and adhesion, as well as cardiomyogenic and angiogenic differentiation of these cells in vivo [2]. The application of BMSCs in MI has entered a phase of clinical research. Rodrigo et al. [3] found that intramyocardial injection of autologous BMSCs in acute MI patients is feasible and safe after 5 years of follow-up. Another research study showed that intracoronary infusion of human BMSCs at 1 month is tolerable and safe with modest improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction at 6-month follow-up [4]. Even allogeneic BMSCs were used in clinical trials, and found safe and well tolerated when administered intravenously in acute MI patients 2 days after percutaneous coronary intervention up to 2 years of follow-up [5].",
        "MI is a disease that seriously threatens people’s health. Degeneration of cardiac tissues, a major cause of mortality in the western world, is likely to become a greater problem in the forthcoming decades. Cardiac damage is associated with dysfunction and irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes [6]. At present, drugs, intervention, and coronary artery bypass grafting treatment are used to partially improve myocardial ischemia, but these methods cannot rescue tissue damaged by MI. The main reasons for the increased incidence of heart failure and mortality after MI are the local reduction in the number of cardiocytes in the infarcted area caused by high oxidative stress in the inflammatory microenvironment, as well as tissue fibrosis, formation of scar tissue, and cardiac remodeling. Consequently, clinicians have begun to seek a new method for the treatment of heart failure after MI.",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), originating from mesoderm adult stem cells, retain the ability to amplify and self-renew in vitro and differentiate into cartilage, fat, bone, and nerve cells under certain conditions. MSCs are in great demand because of their low immunogenicity and immunomodulatory capacity, effectively reducing or avoiding immune rejection. MSCs can be derived from a variety of tissues including bone marrow, fat, muscle, and synovial membrane. Among all MSCs examined, BMSCs are the most popular in application because of their obvious advantages. In addition to their relatively easy acquisition from an extensively rich resource, BMSCs are free from ethical issues because they can be transplanted autologously. Furthermore, the relatively simple cultivation and separation, rapid proliferation, and high genetic stability of BMSCs allow for their easy amplification in vitro. Finally, their capacity for multidirectional differentiation, low immunogenicity, and high portability make BMSCs ideal seed cells for therapy of cardiovascular diseases. Because of the activity of chemotactic protein stromal cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), BMSCs have the ability for automatic homing on the infarction area after transplantation [7–9], significantly facilitating the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The therapeutic effect of BMSCs involves a series of mechanisms after their transplantation into ischemic myocardium. These include the differentiation and fusion of BMSCs to cardiocytes and endothelial cells; paracrine effects related to the secretion of various cytokines like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-6, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), SDF-1, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which promote the restoration of cardiac function; the mobilization of autologous cardiac stem cells or progenitor cells to differentiate into cardiomyocytes and proliferation under the microenvironment created by BMSCs to continuously improve cardiac function; and the inhibition of inflammatory responses by reducing inflammatory cytokine levels and gene expression to protect the myocardium. Many studies [10, 11] have shown that transplantation of BMSCs after MI greatly promotes the differentiation of cardiocytes surrounding the infarction area, enhances angiogenesis, increases apoptotic resistance, and exerts anti-fibrotic effects, significantly improving myocardial repair after MI. Combined shock wave and autologous BMSC therapy has also been shown to be more effective than either therapy alone in inhibiting apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as in augmenting angiogenesis in the infarcted area in animal models [12].",
        "After MI, the ischemic anoxic environment seriously affects the survival of transplanted cells. In-depth research into BMSC transplantation in the treatment of MI has led to the realization that the effect of single-cell transplantation is limited. Therefore, researchers have tried to improve the harsh environment after infarction and enhance the capacity of transplanted cells to resist ischemic anoxia. Numerous studies discussed in the following have reported that hypoxic preconditions, various drug combinations, and joint cytokine and gene transfection treatments can improve the anti-oxidative stress capacity of transplanted BMSCs and increase their survival rate.",
        "As a novel strategy for preconditioning BMSCs, treatment with hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine has been shown to greatly improve the cell survival rate in vivo and in vitro, and to reduce the area of MI to enhance the effect of cell therapy [13]. Some researchers have suggested that the modification of BMSCs with a fused gene expressing fibroblast growth factor 4 and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) can not only increase the expression of bFGF but also enhance the survival of the transplanted cells and improve cardiac functions in animal models [14]. Mao et al. [15] found that microRNA (miR)-23a inhibited apoptosis of BMSCs induced by TNF-α through the regulation of caspase-7 in vitro, and that injection of BMSCs overexpressing miR-23a reduced infarct size and improved left ventricular (LV) function in a rat MI model, providing an alternative treatment strategy for patients with heart failure caused by MI who are not optimal candidates for surgical treatment. The hypoxic microenvironment after MI can also affect the activity of BMSCs. Recent in-vitro research has suggested that apoptosis of BMSCs under hypoxic conditions is regulated by autophagy via the AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway [16]. Another study showed that inhibition of inositol hexakisphosphate kinases has the potential to enhance functional survival of engrafted BMSCs via activation of the Akt signaling pathway in vitro [17]. Other researchers have found that treatment with a low dose of atorvastatin facilitates the survival of engrafted BMSCs and improves tissue repair, regeneration, and cardiac function after BMSC transplantation in an experimental animal model [18]. Wang et al. [19] found that the combination of BMSCs with melatonin pretreatment led to an effective reduction in intracellular reactive oxygen, which increased the levels of Bcl-2/Bax, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated caspase-3, thus promoting resistance to cell death induced under hypoxic and serum-free conditions, which may improve cardiac function in vivo.",
        "In addition to cell viability, migration and homing of BMSCs is another crucial factor that influences their therapeutic effect. BMSCs demonstrate a migratory tendency to infarcted myocardial tissues after transplantation through the intravenous route, which can obviously delay deterioration in cardiac function caused by LV remodeling. However, because of the need to reach the infarction area by blood circulation, this method requires an excessive quantity of injected cells, which may cause venous embolism in a rat model [20]. Therefore, researchers have begun to explore methods for enhancing the migration and homing ability of BMSCs. Hu et al. [21] compared BMSCs pretreated with normal oxygen or 0.5% O2 for 24 h and found that the migration and homing of hypoxia-treated cells to the site of myocardial injury was enhanced significantly, which may be connected to Kv2.1 channel and focal adhesion kinase activation in vitro. Cheng et al. [22] demonstrated that Src family kinases were activated by SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling and played an essential role in the SDF-1/CXCR4-mediated BMSC chemotactic response and ischemic cardiac recruitment in a mouse model.",
        "MSCs possess the features of weak immunogenicity and antigen-presenting ability as a consequence of low expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and Fas ligand and no expression of MHC class I molecules, which enables MSCs to inhibit T-cell proliferation [23], resulting in immune exemption or immune tolerance. The immunomodulatory mechanism of MSCs mainly involves two aspects: inhibition of active inflammatory substances through a paracrine mechanism [24]; and the regulation of immune cells [25]. Guo et al. [26] found that expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and cardiocyte apoptosis were markedly reduced after MSC transplantation, resulting in significant improvement of myocardial function in a mouse model. Ohnishi et al. [27] discovered that myocardial tissue levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were significantly decreased after MSC transplantation in a rat model of acute myocarditis, and, accordingly, inflammatory cell infiltration was reduced. These studies suggest that MSCs are involved in immune regulation through paracrine mechanisms, and additional studies support their immunomodulatory influence on some immune cells. For example, the proliferation of T cells [28] and natural killer cells [29] and the maturation of dendritic cells [30] were inhibited by MSCs. The prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2) receptor of macrophages was reported to interact with the PGE-2 receptor of MSCs, prompting M2 macrophages to release anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and thus inhibit the inflammatory response in vitro [31]. B-cell amplification and the production of IgM, IgG, and IgA were restrained by soluble molecules produced by MSCs, resulting in the prevention of B-cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo [32].",
        "As a type of MSC, BMSCs can also suppress the inflammatory response after MI. A study demonstrated that exosomes were the active ingredient of paracrine secretion by BMSCs, which stimulated neovascularization, restrained the inflammatory response, and improved cardiac function after ischemic injury in vitro and in vivo [33]. Hsu et al. [34] found that the CXCR4 antagonist TG-0054 improved impaired LV contractility following MI by mobilizing BMSCs to attenuate postinfarction inflammation in a porcine model.",
        "After the occurrence of MI, many cardiocytes die and are replaced by fibroblasts in the infarcted area. Heart failure is triggered by LV remodeling and arrhythmia, which is a major cause of cardiovascular death. Stem cells can inhibit the activation of fibroblasts, reduce the deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix, thereby reducing LV remodeling, and improve cardiac function after MI mainly by regulating matrix metalloproteinases and inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases. HGF, a well-known anti-fibrosis factor, was demonstrated to be a major contributor to the anti-fibrosis function of MSCs in vitro [35]. Another study revealed that BMSCs transplanted into the surrounding area after MI released HGF, which inhibited miR-155-mediated profibrosis signaling, thereby preventing cardiac fibrosis in a mouse model [36]. A novel study showed that nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) siRNA could effectively interfere with Nrf2 expression in BMSCs and reduce the repair ability of exogenous BMSCs in MI heart, which increased collagen deposition in the infarcted area, thus contributing to ventricular remodeling and reducing cardiac function in a rat model [37].",
        "Angiogenesis, an important process in the treatment of MI, refers to development of great vessels and capillaries. Abundant paracrine factors such as VEGF and SDF-1 are released by MSCs transplanted into the surrounding infarcted area, can regulate angiogenesis, and inhibit signaling pathways to promote the formation of novel vasoganglion.",
        "An increasing volume of literature has reported that miRNAs participate in the regulation of vascular cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and other biological processes. Some miRNAs possess the ability to promote angiogenesis, such as miR-126, miR-132, and others. The excessive expression of miR-126 facilitated angiogenesis around the infarcted area by regulating the AKT/ERK signaling pathway in a rat model [38]. Another study also reported that miR-126 promoted angiogenesis of MSCs via the AKT/ERK-related pathway in a mouse model [39]. Tang et al. [40] used a rat model of MI to compare the recovery after transplantation of BMSCs alone, treatment with VEGF alone, or VEGF treatment combined with BMSC transplantation. Combination therapy significantly increased vascular density, decreased the formation of scar tissue, and improved cardiac function compared to either treatment alone or to untreated infarcted control rats [40]. VEGF treatment also promoted the differentiation of CXCR4-positive BMSCs into vessel endothelial cells in vitro [41]. Another research study has suggested that overexpression of the cellular repressor of adenovirus E1A-stimulated genes in BMSCs may promote VEGF-induced angiogenesis by inhibiting Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor-mediated HIF-1α degradation, consequently protecting against rat MI [42].",
        "MSCs present a zonal distribution in myocardial tissue after transplantation similar to the distribution of cardiocytes. The increase in cardiac-specific marker proteins such as troponin preliminarily confirms the differentiation of BMSCs into cardiocytes. The activation of Notch1 signaling contributed to multilineage differentiation of c-KitPOS/NKX2.5POS BMSCs isolated from Sprague–Dawley rat femurs into cardiomyocytes [43]. Retrograde coronary venous infusion of bFGF further augments engraftment and differentiation of transplanted BMSCs, allowing for recovery of cardiac function and preventing adverse remodeling in a canine infarct model [44]. A combination of bFGF and hydrocortisone also promotes the differentiation of BMSCs into cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro [45]. In addition, overexpression of miRNA-1-2 in mouse BMSCs via the WNT signaling pathway can induce the differentiation of BMSCs into cardiomyocytes more effectively [46].",
        "BMSCs can be differentiated not only into cardiomyocyte-like cells but also into endothelial cells, which contribute to the regeneration of the vasculature after MI. For example, it has been demonstrated that atherogenic cytokines regulate VEGF-A-induced differentiation of BMSCs into endothelial cells in vitro [47].",
        "Although transplantation of BMSCs has brought a new option for MI treatment, there are still significant problems to be solved. Because of the lack of a specific marker on the surface of BMSCs, exclusive identification can only be made based on cell shape. Unfortunately, the cellular viability of transplanted BMSCs has not been high because of the lack of blood supply, poor nourishment of transplanted cells, and the generation of free radicals [48]. Spontaneous malignant transformation may represent a biohazard in long-term expansion of human BMSCs in vitro [49]. Furthermore, implanted BMSCs sometimes fail to metabolically stabilize or recover electromechanical function in rat infarcted hearts [50]. A few literature studies have reported anti-fibrotic, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory effects of BMSCs after MI, as we have already documented. Moreover, current research has remained at the basal level, with little clinical research about the treatment of MI by transplantation of BMSCs in human trials. Therefore, greater efforts should be made to investigate the application of BMSCs for the regeneration of cardiomyocytes after MI. At present, the most important goal is to improve the survival rate of BMSCs after infarction transplantation, which will form the basis for solutions to the remaining problems. A large number of clinical trials should be implemented to confirm the optimal dose and route of administration of BMSCs in the treatment of MI patients.",
        "BMSCs can serve as ideal seed cells in cardiovascular disease therapy because of their capacity for multidirectional differentiation, easy acquisition, rapid proliferation, low immunogenicity, and high portability. Furthermore, transplanted BMSCs can reduce apoptosis, migrate to infarcted myocardial tissues, inhibit fibrosis and inflammation, promote neovascularization, and differentiate into cardiomyocyte-like cells which contribute to the repair of cardiomyocytes. Despite these advantages of BMSCs in the treatment of MI, the most important problem we must now address is the reduced viability of transplanted BMSCs due to inadequate blood supply, poor nourishment of cells, and generation of free radicals. In clinical trials, the feasibility and safety of BMSC therapy have been tested, but the optimal dose and route of administration of BMSCs should be investigated in the treatment of MI.",
