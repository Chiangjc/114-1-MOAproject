    "title": "Update on the pathophysiology and treatment of primary Sjogren syndrome. characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, particularly the salivary and lacrimal glands, leading to progressive glandular dysfunction and subsequent xerostomia and xerophthalmia. Other common manifestations include pain and fatigue, various systemic manifestations and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Sjogren syndrome is therefore a complex and disabling disease associated with a reduced quality of life and with considerable long-term damage. Most of the available treatments are merely symptomatic with limited efficacy in both preventing glandular damage and suppressing systemic disease activity. In the past 10 years, great progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of Sjogren syndrome, opening new avenues towards a more targeted and individualized therapeutic approach to the disease. Indeed, several randomized controlled trials have just been completed or are poised to commence evaluating the effectiveness of novel drugs targeting both innate and adaptive immune pathways, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, the type I interferon system, B cell activation, B cell and T cell co-stimulation pathway, and ectopic germinal centre formation. Novel clinical trials are also ongoing exploring various targeted approaches (that is, IgG recycling inhibition, nuclease therapy and CAR-T cell therapy) for Sjogren syndrome. of Pisa, Pisa, Italy. chiara.baldini74@gmail.com. of Pisa, Pisa, Italy. of Pisa, Pisa, Italy. of Pisa, Pisa, Italy. 2024 Jul 9.",

      "abstract": "Primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes and mouth, often with systemic involvement. This study aimed to investigate the clinical manifestations and laboratory features in pSS patients, particularly focusing on those with anti-centromere antibodies (ACA) and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 152 patients diagnosed with pSS at Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Hospital from 2018 to 2023, using the 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria. Additionally, 105 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included to establish a comparative baseline for laboratory parameters. Clinical data were obtained from medical records, and patients were categorized into ACA-positive and SSA-positive groups based on their autoantibody profiles. Appropriate statistical analyses, including ANOVA, chi-square tests, correlation analysis, and multivariate regression analysis, were used to compare clinical and laboratory parameters in pSS patients. ACA-positive patients were significantly older and exhibited a higher prevalence of Raynaud’s phenomenon and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, while SSA-positive patients presented with more marked hematological abnormalities. ACA-positive patients have a more prevalent occurrence of positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-mitochondrial M2 antibodies (AMA-M2), as well as significantly higher levels of left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), IgM, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In addition, SSA-positive patients exhibited elevated levels of globulins (GLB), IgG, IgA, and rheumatoid factor (RF), accompanied by decreased albumin (ALB) levels. ACA-positive patients had abnormal proportions of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and had reduced counts of NK cells (CD16 + CD56 + ), CD3 + T cells, and CD8 + T cells. Correlation and multivariate regression analyses revealed a significant association between NK cell and levels of IgG, IgM, GLB, and LDH. Furthermore, SSA-positive patients showed abnormal proportions of CD19 + B cells and NK cells, with reduced counts of CD3 + T cells (including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells) and NK cells. Correlation and multivariate regression analyses indicated a significant correlation between CD4 + T cell and levels of IgG, ALB, and GLB. Overall, T cell-mediated immunity plays a significant role in SSA-positive patients; NK cells are shown to be critically involved in the pathogenesis of ACA-positive pSS.",

        "Primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder marked by the progressive infiltration of immune cells into exocrine glands, which results in gland dysfunction and manifests as dryness in the affected areas [1]. Beyond dry symptoms, pSS is also associated with systemic manifestations, including fatigue, arthralgia, and involvement of other organs such as the kidneys, liver, heart, and lungs. The variable presentation of this condition, with differing degrees of glandular and extraglandular involvement, poses challenges for diagnosis and treatment [2,3]. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms, clinical presentations, and laboratory characteristics of pSS is vital for effective patient management and the development of therapeutic strategies.",
        "The presence of specific autoantibodies plays a crucial role in the diagnosis, disease stratification, and treatment decision-making for pSS patients. Two of the most significant autoantibodies found in pSS patients are anti-SSA/Ro antibodies and anti-centromere antibodies (ACA) [4,5]. Studies indicate that anti-SSA/Ro antibodies can be detected in approximately 33–74% of pSS patients, while anti-centromere antibodies are found in a smaller subset, typically ranging from 4–27% [1,6,7]. The ACA was initially identified in patients with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Studies have shown that ACA is not only significantly associated with the clinical phenotype of pSS but also correlates with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic sclerosis (SSc) [7,8]. It has been reported that ACA-positive pSS patients differ from ACA-negative patients in terms of clinical and laboratory features, including an older age at diagnosis, more frequent occurrences of Raynaud’s phenomenon, liver damage, objective symptoms of dry eyes, peripheral neuropathy, lower prevalence of rheumatoid factor, and a lower incidence of leukopenia and hypergammaglobulinemia [8–10]. These studies indicate that ACA-positive patients represent a distinct subgroup of pSS, characterized by specific clinical manifestations, disease course, and prognosis. However, there are limitations and controversies surrounding certain outcomes associated with ACA positivity. Distinguishing the clinical and laboratory findings associated with the two subtypes of pSS is key to unraveling the disease’s pathogenesis and to the customization of treatment plans.",
        "This study focuses on the clinical manifestations and laboratory features in pSS patients, specifically those positive for anti-centromere antibodies and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. The research aims to clarify the differences in clinical manifestations between these two groups of pSS patients, as well as to explore the correlation between laboratory indicators and these clinical features.",
        "This study is a single-center retrospective analysis utilizing electronic health records of patients diagnosed with pSS who were hospitalized at Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Hospital between January 2018 and December 2023. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients met the diagnostic criteria for pSS established by the 2016 ACR/EULAR guidelines [11]; 2) patients were over 18 years of age; 3) patients were newly diagnosed and had not used glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants in the past three months. Exclusion criteria included: 1) patients with concomitant conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic sclerosis (SSc) or mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD); 2) a history of radiation therapy to the head and neck, hepatitis C virus infection, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, AIDS, graft-versus-host disease, or IgG4-related diseases; 3) pregnant or breastfeeding women; 4) patients with incomplete clinical data. Ultimately, 152 patients were included in the study. Additionally, 105 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals who underwent physical examinations at the same hospital during the same period were selected as healthy controls. Based on their autoantibodies, the pSS patients were divided into an ACA-positive group (n = 53) and an SSA-positive group (n = 99). The ACA-positive group had only anti-centromere antibodies, while the SSA-positive group exclusively had anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Hospital (Ethics Approval No.: KY2024SL337–01), and the requirement for written informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. Data were accessed for research purposes from October 25, 2024, to November 4, 2024.",
        "Demographic and clinical variables, including gender, age, disease duration, extra-glandular manifestations, and comorbidities, were extracted from the electronic medical records system of Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Hospital. Systemic involvement was defined according to the 2010 EULAR Sjögren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) [12]. Articular involvement was characterized by arthralgias with morning stiffness lasting over 30 minutes or joint synovitis. Cutaneous involvement was defined as cutaneous vasculitis including urticarial vasculitis, diffuse purpura, ulcers related to vasculitis and so on. Neurological involvement referred to damage to the peripheral and/or central nervous systems. Pulmonary involvement was defined as pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease (ILD) accompanied by respiratory symptoms or abnormal pulmonary function tests. Renal involvement included renal tubular acidosis (with or without renal failure) or glomerular involvement with proteinuria exceeding 0.5 g/day. Digestive involvement encompassed impaired digestive function, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), autoimmune cholangitis, or primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Hematological involvement was defined as leukopenia, anemia, lymphopenia, or thrombocytopenia after excluding medication effects or other diseases. Additionally, sclerodactyly, characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin of the fingers, was recorded. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was assessed by two experienced sonographers using the mitral E/A ratio and/or the septal basal E’/A’ ratio, with a diagnostic threshold below 1 indicating compromised myocardial relaxation [13]. Electrocardiographic abnormalities included atrioventricular conduction block, non-specific ST-segment changes, abnormal T waves, axis deviation, bundle branch block, and prolonged QT interval. Autoimmune thyroid diseases included Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.",
        "Laboratory parameters, including biochemical indicators, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), autoantibodies, immunoglobulins, complements, rheumatoid factors, routine blood tests, lymphocyte subsets, and echocardiographic assessments, were obtained by reviewing the medical records. Biochemical indicators, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), were measured using the velocity method on an automatic biochemical analyzer (ADVIA2400, Siemens Healthineers, Germany). Total protein (TP) and albumin (ALB) levels were determined via the biuret method and bromcresol green method, respectively, while globulin (GLB) levels were calculated by subtracting albumin from total protein. ANAs were detected using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA) with a commercial kit (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany), with HEp-2 cells as the substrate. Autoantibodies against nRNP, Sm, SSA/Ro60, SSA/Ro52, SSB/La, Scl-70, PM-Scl, Jo-1, PCNA, CENP-B, AMA M2, dsDNA, histones, nucleosomes, and RibP were detected by immunoblotting (Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd, China). Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA), complements (C3, C4), and rheumatoid factors (RF) were quantitatively assessed by immunonephelometry (IMMAGE 800, Beckman Coulter, USA). Routine blood tests, including white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NE), lymphocytes (LC), monocytes (Mono), red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and platelets (PLT), were measured using flow cytometry (XN-2800, Sysmex Corporation, Japan). Lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD19+, CD16+CD56+) were analyzed by flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FACS Canto, Becton Dickinson, USA) with FlowJo Software (Treestar, USA). Echocardiographic assessments were performed using the Philips IE 33 color Doppler ultrasound system (Philips Healthcare, USA), with measurements including left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), interventricular septum thickness (IVST), left atrial diameter (LAD), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).",
        "Data analysis was performed using SPSS 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA) and GraphPad Prism 9 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, California, USA). The normality of the data was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test, and variance homogeneity was evaluated using Levene’s test. Continuous data conforming to a normal distribution are presented as mean ± standard deviation. For datasets with homogeneous variance, ANOVA was used for comparisons among multiple groups, with the Scheffé method employed for post-hoc multiple comparisons. For datasets with heterogeneous variance, Welch’s ANOVA was utilized, followed by Games-Howell post-hoc comparisons. Skewed data are presented as median (Q1, Q3); comparisons between ACA-positive and SSA-positive groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis test was utilized for comparisons among other multiple groups, with post-hoc assessments adjusted using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Categorical data are expressed as n (%), with group comparisons assessed using Chi-squared tests or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Post-hoc comparisons were conducted with Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple testing. Pearson or Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between immune markers, biochemical parameters and lymphocyte subsets. The relationship between immune markers, biochemical parameters and lymphocyte subsets was analyzed using multivariate regression analysis. A P-value <0.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant.",
        "The demographic and clinical features of the three groups are presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences in gender distribution among the groups. However, ACA-positive pSS patients exhibited a significantly older age compared to SSA-positive pSS patients (P < 0.05). The ACA-positive group showed a significantly higher prevalence of Raynaud’s phenomenon (16.98%) and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (50.94%) than the SSA-positive group (3.03% and 33.33%, respectively; P < 0.01 for Raynaud’s phenomenon and P < 0.05 for left ventricular diastolic dysfunction). Conversely, systemic involvement of the hematological system was more pronounced in the SSA-positive group, with significant differences in anemia (29.29% vs. 9.43%, P < 0.01), leukopenia (31.31% vs. 13.21%, P < 0.05), and neutropenia (22.22% vs. 7.55%, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the involvement of the skin, joints, digestive system, lungs, kidneys, or nervous system between the two groups. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the history of hypertension, diabetes, malignant tumors, or the presence of sclerodactyly, electrocardiographic abnormalities and other autoimmune diseases.",

        "The routine blood tests, biochemical, immunological parameters, and echocardiographic results of the enrolled subjects are summarized in Table 2. There were no significant differences in ALT, ALP, GGT, C4 levels, and monocyte counts among the three groups. However, significant differences were identified in WBC, NE, LC, RBC, Hb, PLT, GLB, ALB, AST, LDH, IgG, IgM, IgA, and C3 levels (P < 0.05 for all). Post hoc analysis indicated that both the ACA-positive and SSA-positive groups had significantly lower WBC, NE, LC, and PLT, alongside increased AST levels compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05 for all). The SSA-positive group also displayed lower RBC compared to healthy controls, as well as lower RBC and ALB levels than the ACA-positive group (P < 0.05 for all). Furthermore, ACA-positive patients demonstrated significantly increased LDH levels compared to both healthy controls and the SSA-positive group (P < 0.05 for both). In contrast to the healthy controls, the SSA-positive group exhibited significantly lower C3 levels and concurrently higher IgG and IgA levels, which were notably more pronounced than those in the ACA-positive group (P < 0.05 for all). Although IgM levels in the ACA-positive group were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (P < 0.05), the levels in the ACA-positive group were also higher but did not reach statistical significance compared to the SSA-positive group (P = 0.078). Consistent with previous findings, there were no significant differences in the proportions of abnormal C4 and IgM across the groups (P > 0.05 for both); however, variations in IgG, IgA, C3, and RF abnormalities were noted, with the SSA-positive group exhibiting a significantly higher prevalence of IgG, IgA, and RF abnormalities compared to both ACA-positive and healthy control groups (P < 0.05 for all), and no significant difference between the ACA-positive and healthy controls (P > 0.05 for all). Both ACA-positive and SSA-positive groups had significantly higher proportions of C3 abnormalities compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05 for both). In terms of autoantibodies, the positivity rate for ANA and AMA-M2 was significantly higher in the ACA-positive group than in the SSA-positive group (P < 0.05 for both), while all autoantibodies were negative in the healthy control group. Among SSA-positive patients, the positive rates for anti-SSA/Ro52, anti-SSA/Ro60, and anti-SSB/La antibodies were 88 cases (88.89%), 80 cases (80.81%), and 38 cases (38.38%), respectively. All other autoantibodies, including anti-nRNP, anti-Sm, anti-Scl-70, anti-PM-Scl, anti-Jo-1, anti-PCNA, anti-dsDNA, anti-histones, anti-nucleosomes, and anti-RibP were negative in all pSS patients. Echocardiographically, there were no significant disparities in IVST, LAD, or LVEF between the two patient groups (P > 0.05 for all); however, the LVEDD was notably elevated in the ACA-positive patients compared to the SSA-positive patients (P < 0.05).",

        "The distribution of T cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+), B cells (CD19+) and NK cells (CD16+CD56+) across the three groups is showed in Fig 1. No significant differences were found in the prevalence of CD3+ T cells or the absolute counts of B cells (P > 0.05). Compared to the healthy control group, both the ACA-positive and SSA-positive groups had significantly lower absolute counts of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.01). The SSA-positive group had a significantly higher proportion of B cells than the ACA-positive group and healthy controls (P < 0.001), with no significant difference between the ACA-positive group and healthy controls (P > 0.05). Despite this, the absolute counts of B cells were similar across all groups (P > 0.05). The SSA-positive group exhibited a significantly lower proportion of NK cells than the ACA-positive and healthy control groups (P < 0.01). The healthy control group had a higher absolute count of NK cells than the ACA-positive group (P < 0.001), which, in turn, had a higher count than the SSA-positive group (P < 0.001). The ACA-positive group had a higher proportion of CD4+ T cells than the SSA-positive group and healthy controls (P < 0.001), and a lower proportion of CD8+ T cells (P < 0.01).

Serum IgM levels significantly correlated with CD3+ T cell proportions and CD16+CD56+ NK cell proportions and counts, while serum IgA levels were positively associated with T cells counts(CD3+, CD4+, CD8+). Serum C3 levels positively correlated with the absolute counts of T cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+), CD19+ B cells, and CD16+CD56+ NK cells, and serum C4 levels were only positively related to the absolute count of CD8+ T cells. After adjusting for age and sex, IgM levels remained correlated with CD16+CD56+ NK cell proportions (r = 0.246, P = 0.082) and counts (r = 0.264, P = 0.061), and IgA levels significantly correlated with T cell counts (CD3+: r = 0.399, CD4+: r = 0.361, CD8+: r = 0.302; P < 0.05 for all).

        "Our study found that ACA-positive pSS patients were significantly older than those who were SSA-positive. The two groups differed in the prevalence of Raynaud’s phenomenon, hematological involvement and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, with the first two clinical manifestations aligning with findings from previous studies [8–10,14]. Notably, laboratory tests revealed variations in immune-related parameters among the three groups, indicating differences in pathogenic mechanisms associated with distinct autoantibodies. Continuous monitoring of these markers may yield valuable insights into disease progression and treatment efficacy.",
        "The anti-centromere antibody (ACA) is widely recognized as a specific biomarker for systemic sclerosis (SSc), a disorder characterized by microvascular abnormalities and the progression of tissue fibrosis [15,16]. These abnormalities in microvasculature are frequently associated with the onset of Raynaud’s phenomenon [17]. In our study, the prevalence of Raynaud’s phenomenon was significantly higher among pSS patients with positive ACA than among those with positive SSA/Ro, consistent with recent studies [10,18]. Furthermore, our laboratory data from pSS patients with positive ACA showed significantly higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and a greater incidence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. This suggests that ACA-positive patients with pSS require heightened attention and monitoring for cardiovascular-related diseases compared to those with SSA positivity. Previous research has indicated that Raynaud’s phenomenon is a potent risk factor associated with the onset of pulmonary hypertension and left-ventricular regional dysfunction in patients with autoimmune disorders [19,20]. Our research also indirectly supports this observation. Since left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is one of the mechanisms leading to heart failure in patients with rheumatic diseases, and heart failure is a primary cause of mortality in these patients, continuous monitoring of the cardiovascular health of pSS patients, particularly those with ACA, is crucial for prognosis assessment.",
        "The anti-SSA/Ro antibody, a common autoimmune marker, can be detected in various diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoimmune liver disease, and myositis [21,22]. However, anti-SSA/Ro antibodies are considered one of the specific diagnostic indicators in pSS patients [11]. Studies have shown that patients with anti-SSA/Ro antibodies are more likely to have other autoimmune antibodies, such as rheumatoid factor (RF) [23], and they exhibit significantly increased risk factors for involvement of other organs [24,25]. Consistently, nearly half of the anti-SSA/Ro-positive pSS patients in our study tested positive for rheumatoid factor, with high titers > 80 U/mL, although specific titers are not shown here. This finding suggests an increased likelihood of concurrent rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, compared to the ACA-positive group, patients with SSA-positive pSS exhibited a significantly higher rate of hematological involvement, encompassing anemia, leukopenia, and neutropenia, than those in the ACA-positive group (P < 0.05). This phenomenon has been reported in numerous previous studies as well [10,14,18]. These results suggest that anti-SSA/Ro antibodies may have a considerable systemic impact compared to ACA in pSS patients. Therefore, the systemic clinical symptoms influenced by anti-SSA/Ro antibodies may also contribute to the observation that SSA-positive pSS patients tend to be diagnosed at a significantly younger age than their ACA-positive counterparts.",
        "Whole blood lymphocyte subsets are closely associated with the disease activity of Sjögren’s syndrome [26]. Significant differences in these parameters were observed between the two groups of pSS patients, indicating disease heterogeneity among different pSS subtypes. CD19+ B cells are critical in the pathophysiology of Sjögren’s syndrome due to their overactivation, which leads to the production of various autoantibodies. These autoantibodies manifest as abnormalities in immunoglobulin levels and may target and damage autologous tissues, contributing to the clinical symptoms of the disease [27]. As reported in previous research [10], the current study shows that patients with pSS who are positive for SSA, in contrast to those with positive ACA or healthy subjects, had a significantly higher proportion of CD19+ B cells, along with increased concentrations of globulin (GLB), IgG, IgA, and RF. This suggests that SSA-positive patients may exhibit a more severe disease phenotype, characterized by heightened B cell activity and autoimmune responses. Consistently, research by Seror et al. [28] demonstrated that rituximab can significantly alleviate clinical manifestations in patients with systemic involvement while reducing rheumatoid factor, γ-globulin, and β2-microglobulin levels. However, clinical studies have shown that not all patients with pSS respond to this treatment [29], suggesting that the disease may involve complex autoimmune mechanisms. Other immune cells, such as T cells and NK cells, likely play significant roles in the pathology, indicating that B cell depletion alone may not effectively modulate the immune response. In our study, after adjusting for age and gender, we found that serum levels of globulins (GLB), albumin (ALB), and IgG in SSA-positive pSS patients were significantly correlated with CD4+ T cells, and multivariate regression analysis further demonstrated that these parameters were independently associated with CD4+ T cells. These findings underscore the critical role of interactions between CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells in the pathophysiology of Sjögren’s syndrome. Specifically, a negative feedback mechanism may exist between CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells, where CD4+ T cells secrete various cytokines (e.g., interleukin-21, interleukin-17, and IFN-γ) [30] that lead to the abnormal activation and differentiation of B cells, resulting in the production of large amounts of autoantibodies, abnormal immunoglobulins, and additional cytokines. This overproduction (e.g., interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and interleukin-35) can feedback to the body, subsequently causing a decrease in the absolute count of other lymphocyte populations [31]. In our comparative study of Sjögren’s syndrome patients and healthy controls, we observed no significant difference in the absolute count of B cells; however, the absolute counts of other lymphocyte subsets were markedly reduced in the Sjögren’s syndrome patients, which further confirms the intricate relationship between these immune cells.",
        "CD8+ T cells also play a important role in the pathology of Sjögren’s syndrome, exerting cytotoxic effects that target glandular cells and result in glandular damage and dysfunction [32].Previous studies have shown increased T cell infiltration in the salivary glands of patients with Sjögren’s syndrome, primarily consisting of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [33,34], with the latter rarely undergoing local proliferation during disease progression but being readily recruited and differentiated from peripheral sources [35]. This suggests that cell migration may be one of contributing factor to the decreased absolute counts of CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of these patients. Moreover, after adjusting for age and sex, we found that the absolute count of peripheral blood CD8+ T cells in ACA-positive pSS patients was significantly correlated with complement levels C3 and C4. Multivariate regression analysis further indicated that the absolute count of CD8+ T cells independently correlated with complement C4 levels. These results indicate that changes in the absolute count of CD8+ T cells in ACA-positive pSS patients may be directly associated with complement activation status, which could promote CD8+ T cell activation or proliferation. Notably, numerous clinical studies have demonstrated a strong association between complement levels and disease activity in autoimmune disorders [14,36,37], suggesting that CD8+ T cells may serve as potential biomarkers for predicting disease activity in Sjögren’s syndrome. Interestingly, no correlation was found between CD8+ T cells and complement levels in patients with SSA-positive primary Sjögren’s syndrome. This suggests that the immune responses and pathological mechanisms may differ between the two patient groups. Antibodies against SSA/Ro might trigger distinct types of immune responses, leading to variations in complement activation patterns and lymphocyte responses.",
        "CD16+CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells play a complex and pivotal role in autoimmune diseases. As crucial immune cells, they possess the ability to recognize and eliminate infected or tumor cells, while also contributing to the regulation of immune responses. Our study found that the absolute count of CD16+CD56+ NK cells was significantly lower in both pSS groups compared to healthy controls, which may disrupt immune surveillance and contribute to the higher incidence of tumors in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome [38]. In our study, the elevated malignancy incidence rates in both SS patients, with 11.32% in the ACA-positive group and 14.13% in the SSA-positive group, further support this observation. Additionally, previous studies have indicated that patients with Sjögren’s syndrome are more likely to develop autoimmune liver diseases, such as autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), compared to those with other autoimmune disorders [39,40]. The present study compared the incidence of autoimmune liver disease between two cohorts of pSS patients, concurrently analyzing serum biochemical and immunological parameters, as well as the presence of anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (AMA-M2). No significant disparities were found in liver enzyme levels or the prevalence of autoimmune liver diseases between the two pSS cohorts. Notably, the AMA-M2 positivity rate was substantially higher in ACA-positive pSS patients (26.42%) than in SSA-positive patients (7.07%, P < 0.05). Research indicates that in the initial phase of PBC, liver function often remains normal or slightly elevated, with the presence of ANA, particularly those with centromere positivity, serving as a potential early indicator [41]. In our study, the ACA-positive subgroup exhibited elevated IgM levels. Correlation and multiple regression analyses revealed an independent positive association between CD16+CD56+ NK cell counts and IgM levels in ACA-positive pSS patients, despite the overall reduction in NK cell counts in pSS. This suggests that the remaining NK cells may modulate IgM production or maintain immune homeostasis in ACA-positive pSS patients. Since AMA-M2 is a hallmark antibody of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and PBC patients typically show elevated IgM levels [41], ACA-positive pSS patients may be at an enhanced risk for developing PBC, potentially due to dysregulated CD16+CD56+ NK cell activation.",
        "This retrospective study has several limitations. First, due to the chronic nature of Sjögren’s syndrome, which typically has a prolonged course, we excluded patients who had received treatments such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants to minimize their impact on the results. As a result, the relatively small sample size may reduce the statistical power of our analysis. Additionally, the study was conducted at a single center, which limited the number of enrolled patients and may introduce selection bias. Furthermore, as this study relied on data from medical records, despite thorough verification and consistency checks, issues of incomplete or inaccurate information may still exist, potentially introducing biases and confounding factors. Therefore, the conclusions of this study require validation through prospective, multicenter studies or experimental research.",
        "This retrospective study elucidates the distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics of pSS patients stratified by autoantibody status. ACA-positive pSS patients were significantly older and exhibited higher prevalence rates of Raynaud’s phenomenon and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, while SSA-positive patients demonstrated more pronounced hematological abnormalities. Laboratory analyses revealed significant differences in lymphocyte subsets, biochemical parameters, and immune markers. SSA-positive patients had elevated levels of GLB, IgG, IgA, RF, and CD19+ B cells, indicating enhanced autoimmune responses. In contrast, ACA-positive individuals showed increased levels of IgM, LDH and LVEDD, with a notably higher rate of AMA-M2 positivity, suggesting a possible link to cardiovascular complications and primary biliary cholangitis. Correlation and multiple regression analyses highlighted the importance of T cell-mediated immunity in SSA-positive patients, while indicating the crucial role of NK cells in the pathophysiology of ACA-positive pSS. These insights underscore the need for tailored monitoring and management strategies for different pSS subtypes, which may inform future therapeutic approaches.",

Recently, CAR-T has been used in refractory auto-immune diseases with initial encouraging results. In this systematic review, we examined the safety and efficacy of CAR-T in patients with refractory auto-immune diseases. PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus search revealed 1552 articles, of which 24 were included for the final analysis. 80 patients with autoimmune diseases received CAR-T cell therapy, of which 52 patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, 16 patients had systemic sclerosis, 7 patients had idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, 2 patient had anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, 2 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, and 1 patient had Sjogren's disease. 44 patients got CD-19 CAR-T and 36 patients got BCMA/CD-19 compound CAR-T. All the patients achieved an immunosuppression-free state at the last follow-up. Of the 47 patients with follow-up data, 79 patients developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 4 patients developed neurotoxicity. None of the patients had fatal adverse events with CAR-T cell therapy. CAR-T appears to be safe and effective in patients with refractory autoimmune diseases.

        "Autoimmune diseases rank as the third most prevalent disease category after cardiovascular disorders and malignancies, and affect approximately 5%–10% of the global population. Their prevalence and associated disease burden continue to rise.1-4 The etiology of autoimmune diseases is complex and the clinical manifestations are highly heterogeneous, but the common pathological mechanism of these diseases lies in the pathological activation of T lymphocytes and/or B lymphocytes targeting the body’s own antigens.5,6 Conventional therapies for autoimmune diseases predominantly rely on nonspecific immunosuppression via systemic glucocorticoids or broad-spectrum immunosuppressants, aiming to attenuate systemic immune hyperactivity.7-9 While these methods have been effective in controlling symptoms caused by autoimmune diseases, their toxic side effects, including severe infections, bone marrow suppression, liver damage, and malignancies, limit their widespread and long-term use.10-14 Crucially, these treatments do not target the root cause of the disease, that is, the loss of immune self-tolerance.15",
        "The B lymphocyte is a crucial part of the adaptive immune system and holds a central position in the progression of autoimmune diseases. B lymphocytes promote autoimmunity by generating autoantibodies, presenting autoantigens, and promoting T cell signaling and cytokine secretion.16-18 Therapeutic options that aim to depleted B cells have been widely explored in the field of autoimmune diseases. During different stages of development and differentiation, B cells specifically express surface molecules such as CD19, CD20, CD38, transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which are targets for immunotherapy directed against B lymphocytes (Figure 1).\nFigure 1.B cell surface molecules as therapeutic targets. At different stages of B cell development and differentiation, certain surface molecules are specifically expressed. These markers serve as targets for B lymphocyte targeted therapies.

        "Rituximab (RTX), a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20, has been extensively applied in treating a wide range of autoimmune diseases, such as primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) and ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), but it cannot guarantee success in all cases.7,19-21 Studies of RTX resistance have found that autoreactive B cells residing in lymphatic organs and inflamed tissues are more resistant to RTX and impact the immune response to therapy.22-25 TBX21-high memory B cells, which drive chronic inflammation, are primarily found in tissues close to sites of inflammation and exhibit a double-negative phenotype (CD19-negative, CD20-negative), enabling them to escape depletion.26 Also, the primary source of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases – whether from B-cell-derived plasmablasts or long-lived plasma cells–remains uncertain.27 The lack of CD20 or CD19 expression on a proportion of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) may allow them to evade current therapies, potentially reducing treatment efficacy.",
        "While B cells are in the process of differentiating into plasma cells, the expression of CD20 is gradually lost, and CD38 expression increases.28,29 Daratumumab, a monoclonal that targets CD38, showed some efficacy in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases, but was unable to completely deplete numbers of autoantibody-secreting plasma cells.30 Current evidence indicates that the survival of plasma cells is not intrinsic, but microenvironment-dependent, relying on cytokines and cellular interactions.31 B cell activating factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) play key roles in the activation, differentiation and survival of B cells.32-34 The monoclonal belimumab works by blocking the binding of BAFF to its receptors and has been authorized for the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis.35,36 Telitacicept, a recombinant fusion protein, blocks both BAFF and APRIL and has presented favorable efficacy in clinical trials in autoimmune disease treatment.37-40 Regrettably, numerous patients in the aforementioned study still failed to achieve remission.",
        "The efficacy of these B-cell-targeting therapies in the context of autoimmune diseases demonstrates the effectiveness of the B-cell depletion strategy. However, some patients do not respond well to B-cell depletion antibodies, which highlights the need for alternative B-cell depletion therapies. Additionally, due to the lack of immune reset, some patients require long-term treatment, which increases the risk of complications such as infection.17,19,41 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a therapeutic option that has achieved remarkable results in the treatment of B cell malignancies, potentially opening new options for autoimmune diseases treatment.42 The CAR is an engineered fusion receptor that can precisely localize CAR-loaded immune cells to tissues and cells expressing specific antigens and activate their immune function. As previously mentioned, many autoimmune diseases share common pathogenic mechanisms. After the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy was confirmed in SLE, related research quickly expanded to other autoimmune diseases. Whether for organ-specific or systemic autoimmune diseases, CAR-based immunotherapy can effectively intervene in inflammatory and adaptive immune pathways by targeting and clearing pathogenic B cells and other key immune cells, thereby reducing organ damage and achieving disease control (Figure 2). Currently, the spectrum of autoimmune diseases treatable with CAR-based immunotherapy continues to expand, offering a potential cure for more patients.\nFigure 2.CAR-Based immunotherapy: blocking key pathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune diseases. The generation of self-reactive T and B cells, along with the subsequent secretion of pathogenic antibodies and the initiation of inflammatory responses, is a pivotal mechanism in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

We explore the latest progress in universal and in vivo CAR T therapies, as well as cutting-edge research exploring CARs enhancement of a range of immune cells.",
        "CARs are engineered with a modular architecture, typically comprising four functional domains: an extracellular antigen-binding moiety, a flexible hinge region, a transmembrane anchoring segment, and an intracellular signaling module (Figure 3).43 Each domain can affect the efficacy of the CAR. The antigen-binding domain, often originating from a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of monoclonal antibodies, is composed of connecting the variable regions of the heavy and light chains through flexible peptide chains, and is the key determinant of the specificity and sensitivity of CARs in recognizing the target antigen.44-46 The hinge domain connects the antigen recognition domain and the transmembrane domain, which has an important impact on the signal transduction and antigen binding ability of CARs.43,47 The transmembrane domain has the function of localizing the CAR on the plasma membrane and regulating its’ efficacy by affecting the expression level, stability and interaction with other molecules at the cellular exterior interface.48,49 The intracellular signaling domain is the structure that activates the selected immune cell. Based on its structure, CARs are currently classified into five generations. The first-generation CAR is composed of an extracellular antigen-binding domain and intracellular CD3ζ. However, its ability to activate immune cells was limited, resulting in suboptimal therapeutic effects.50 The second-generation CAR, by integrating co-stimulatory domains such as CD28 or 4-1BB into the intracellular domain, markedly enhanced the activation efficiency and persistence of the selected immune cells, laying the foundation for the clinical utilization of CAR T cell therapy.51 On this basis, the third-generation CAR further tandemly combines different co-stimulatory domains, with the expectation of further enhancement of the activation efficiency of the selected immune cells.52 The fourth-generation CAR, termed ‘T cells redirected for universal cytokine killing’ (TRUCKs), integrates an expression system for a specific target protein (e.g., IL-6) into the intracellular domain. Once the CAR is activated, this expression system exerts its function through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms, thereby enhancing the treatment effect of the CAR T cells.53,54 Building on the second-generation CAR, the fifth-generation CAR integrates a truncated cytokine receptor fragment (such as IL-2 Rβ). This promotes the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway relying on antigens, which efficiently supplies all co-signals (T cell receptor (TCR) binding, co-stimulation, and cytokine signaling) essential for full activation and proliferation of the T cell.51\nFigure 3.Structure and function of CARs. The single-chain variable fragment (scFv), derived from the variable heavy (H) and variable light (L) chains of an antibody, is connected by a linker peptide to form the antigen-binding domain of the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). When the antigen-binding domain binds to the target antigen, the activation signal is transmitted through the hinge region and transmembrane domain into the intracellular signaling domain. This binding triggers the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) within the CD3ζ chain, leading to the recruitment of ZAP70 and the initiation of downstream signaling cascades. The co-stimulatory domain plays a key role in providing the second activation signal, synergizing with the ITAM signal to fully activate the host cell. Based on the differences in their intracellular signaling domains, CARs are currently classified into five generations. Fourth-generation CARs are equipped with a cytokine expression system that can be activated simultaneously with CAR engagement, producing specific cytokines to exert immune-modulatory functions. Fifth-generation CARs have the capability to provide cytokine signals, thereby significantly enhancing the cell activation function of CARs.",

        "The design of the CAR underpins all CAR-based immunotherapies, and innovations in its structure can effectively enhance their efficacy and safety. Dual-targeted CARs represent an innovative design. They enable engineered immune cells to express two distinct antigen-binding domains, thereby enhancing treatment specificity and potency. Several dual-targeted CAR designs have been developed. Dual CAR tandem structures have two scFvs linked by a spacer and connected to a transmembrane domain. Immune cell activation requires simultaneous recognition of both antigens. Dual CAR parallel structures involve expressing two independent CARs on the same immune cell, each targeting a different antigen.55 Split-signal CARs connect one antigen-binding domain to a co-stimulatory domain and the other to an activation domain. Full immune cell activation needs both receptors to be triggered. The SynNotch CAR system releases a transcription factor (TF) upon binding to the first antigen. This TF activates the expression of the second CAR, enabling recognition and response to the second antigen.56 As protein engineering and synthetic biology technologies continue to evolve, novel CAR molecules with enhanced safety and efficacy are emerging. This drives the ongoing advancement and refinement of CAR-based immunotherapies.",
        "CAR T cell therapy applies genetic engineering to modify T cells, endowing them with the ability to express CARs. This modification confers upon T cells the capability to precisely identify and assault target cells, thereby exerting a therapeutic effect.57 At present, most of the clinical studies conducted in individuals afflicted with autoimmune diseases have used autologous CAR T cells, that is, T cells which are gathered from the blood in the peripheral circulation of patients and transfected with lentiviral vectors and expanded in vitro. The CAR T cells are re-administered to the patient to eliminate all antigen-directed positive B cells58 (Figure 4). This field is rapidly evolving with the exploration of various target antigens such as CD19 and BCMA, as well as the development of alternative strategies such as allogeneic CAR T cells and in vivo CAR T cells, which are described in the following sections.\nFigure 4.A schematic of the key production steps for three types of CAR T cells (A) The black solid arrows depict the process for production of autologous CAR T cells, while the green dashed arrows illustrate the production process for universal CAR T cells.

        "CD19 is expressed on early pro-B cell through to plasmacyte stage cells, and some plasma cells28 (Figure 1). Therefore, conceptually, CD19-targeted therapies could achieve extensive B cell depletion. Anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy was initially used in 2021 to treat a 20-year-old female suffering from severe refractory SLE, with rapid symptom relief after treatment.59 Subsequently, Mackensen et al. used a similar regimen to treat five patients with severe refractory SLE, all of whom maintained drug-free remission over an 8-month follow-up period, even after the reappearance of B cells.60 Currently, the longest reported relapse-free remission following CAR T cell therapy in SLE is 29 months.61 In the following three years, a large number of autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapies were employed for the clinical study of autoimmune diseases, with promising results (Table 1). Lymph node biopsies belonging to patients administered anti-CD19 CAR T cells revealed complete depletion of CD19+ and CD20+ cells.81 The phenotypic changes of neonatal B cells and the expression patterns of IgM and IgD heavy chains after anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy confirmed the reset of the B cell pool by CAR T cell therapy.60 These findings indicate that anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapies achieve profound and widespread B cell depletion, demonstrating its great potential in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.Table 1.Clinical trials of CAR T cells published in the treatment of autoimmune disease.Therapeutic targetDiseaseOutcomeRefCD19SLE1 patient: achieved CR.59  5 patients: achieved CR maintained for 8-months of follow-up.60  2 pediatric patients: achieved CR.62 SLE, SSc, IIMs8 patients with SLE: achieved MFR;3 patients with IIMs: had an ACR-EULAR major clinical response;4 patients with SSc: decreased the EUSTAR activity index score;effect maintenance over 15 months.61 SLE-ITP1 patient: increased platelet count and decreased autoantibody titer.63 LN1 patient: achieved MFR, discontinued hemodialysis, and recovered partial renal function.64 SRP-IMNM, SSc1 patient with SRP-IMNM: achieved CR;2 patients with SSc: improved ACR-CRISS scores significantly.65 SSc6 patients: improved the ACR-CRISS scores significantly during the 487-day follow-up period.66  1 patient with NSIP: decreased the mRSS score, reduced volume of affected lung and improved lung function.67  1 patient: improved symptoms and disappeared autoantibodies.68 SS1 patient: achieved CR and decreased the ESSDAI score.69 ASS1 patient: improved respiratory symptoms and muscle strength, normalization of serum muscle enzymes, anti-Jo-1 autoantibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines.70  1 patient: improved physical function and decreased anti-Jo-1 antibodies71 gMG1 patient: decreased anti-AchR antibodies, maintained protective IgG titers and improved clinical scores.72  2 patients with MG and LEMS: induced clinical and serological remissions.73  2 patients with MG and RA: improved clinical scores with decreased autoantibodies, but anti-AchR antibodies did not decrease.74 MS2 patients: increased walking distance reported by 1 patient.75 MOGAD1 patient: achieved MFR and disappearance of autoantibodies.76 RA3 patients: improved clinical scores and clearance of RA-related autoantibodies.53  1 patient: achieved MFR and normalization of inflammatory markers.77BCMAgMG7 patients: improved clinical scores maintained in 5 patients until month 12.1 patient underwent retreatment at month 12 with rapid improvement persisting until month 6.78BCMA/CD19SLE, LN13 patients: achieved MFR, 12 of them autoantibody-negative.79 gMG1 patient: achieved CR and disappearance of autoantibodies.80Abbreviation: ACR-CRISS, American College of Rheumatology Composite Response Index in Systemic Sclerosis; ACR-EULAR, American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism criteria; ASS, antisynthetase syndrome; CR, complete response; ESSDAI, EULAR Sjögren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index; EUSTAR, European Scleroderma Trials and Research group; gMG, generalized myasthenia gravis; IIMs, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies; ITP, immune thrombocytopenic purpura; LEMS, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome; LN, lupus nephritis; MFR, medication-free remission; MOGAD, MOG antibody-associated disease; mRSS, Modified Rodnan Skin Score; MS, multiple sclerosis; NSIP, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; SRP-IMNM, signal recognition particle-immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy; SS, Sjögren’s syndrome; SSc, systemic sclerosis.",

        "Following the success of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy, research efforts targeting other B cell antigens are also being actively pushed forward. For example, LLPCs may be CD19-negative but express BCMA. Consequently, CAR T cell therapy targeting BCMA to eliminate pathogenic LLPCs is receiving increasing attention.29,82-84 In a clinical trial for myasthenia gravis, seven patients underwent anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy six times at a frequency of once a week. The clinical symptoms of all patients improved significantly, and five of them did not experience a relapse during the 12-month follow-up period.78,85 The utilization of anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy in treating neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder has also yielded promising therapeutic efficacy.86 A recently published clinical trial report indicates that the application of anti-BCMA/CD19 compound CAR T cells extensively and effectively reduced the generation of autoantibodies in patients with SLE, suggesting that it effectively depletes LLPCs.79 The depletion of LLPCs can significantly reduce levels of protective antibodies; in contrast, anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy does not impair the protective effects of vaccines.60,87,88 The efficacy of BCMA-targeted therapy is worthy of recognition. However, it remains difficult to determine at present whether comprehensive depletion of LLPCs is necessary when treating autoimmune diseases.89",
        "CD19/CD20 or CD19/CD22 bispecific CAR T cell therapies, designed to counter CD19 antigen escape, have been demonstrated to exhibit a more potent capacity for B-cell depletion in lymphoma. Concurrently, these therapies do not increase the toxicity toward non-tumor cells.90-92 However, the efficacy of introducing such bispecific CAR T cell therapies into the field of autoimmune disease treatment remains to be verified. Another CAR T cell therapy founded on BAFF ligand has also demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in SLE mouse models. This therapeutic strategy targets BCMA, BAFF-R, and TACI, thereby reducing the risk of antigen escape associated with single-target approaches.93 Currently, numerous clinical trials investigating CAR T cell therapies targeting different antigens are underway in the field of autoimmune diseases (Table 2). The disclosure of more clinical data will help us better define the indications, efficacy, and safety of these therapies.Table 2.List of ongoing CAR cell therapy trials for autoimmune disease.Therapeutic targetTherapeutic vectorDiseaseClinical trial IDCD19Autologous CAR T cellADNCT06056921, NCT06347718,NCT06373081, NCT06420154,NCT06417398, NCT06361745,NCT06316791, NCT06340490NCT05459870, NCT06688799,NCT06685042, NCT06548620,NCT06680388, NCT06549296,NCT06548607SLENCT06513429, NCT06222853,NCT06465147, NCT03030976,NCT06310811, NCT06121297,NCT06297408, NCT06585514,NCT06333483, NCT06581198,NCT06711146, NCT06710717,NCT06544330LNNCT05938725, NCT06342960SScNCT06400303, NCT06328777IIMsNCT06154252AIDNSNCT05828212, NCT06588491AAVNCT06508346, NCT06590545ITPNCT06352281MGNCT05828225, NCT06193889,NCT06359041, NCT06704269MSNCT06451159, NCT06138132,NCT06384976, NCT06675864,NCT06617793AIHANCT06231368RANCT06475495Immune nephritisNCT06690359RJDMNCT06569472Allogeneic CAR T cellADNCT05859997, NCT06294236,SLENCT05988216, NCT06429800,NCT06752876, NCT06691152AIHANCT06212154RJDMNCT06686524Allogeneic CAR γδ T cellSLENCT06106893Allogeneic CAR NK cellADNCT06733935, NCT06613490,NCT06614270LNNCT06557265CD20Allogeneic CAR γδ T cellADNCT06375993BCMAAutologous CAR T cellSLENCT06340750, NCT06694298  Immune nephritisNCT06497387, NCT06277427,  AIDNSNCT04561557  ITPNCT06519565  MGNCT06688435 Allogeneic CAR T cellNMOSDNCT06633042BCMA/CD19Autologous CAR T cellADNCT06279923, NCT06428188,NCT05263817, NCT06435897,NCT06503224, NCT06775912  SLENCT06350110, NCT05474885,NCT05858684, NCT05846347,NCT06530849  LNNCT06785519  Immune nephritisNCT05085418, NCT06285279,NCT06497361,  SclerodermaNCT05085444  SSNCT05085431  MGNCT06371040, NCT06419166,NCT06759948 Allogeneic CAR T cellAIDNSNCT06485232  LNNCT06681337BCMA/CD20Autologous CAR T cellADNCT06249438BCMA/CD70Autologous CAR T cellImmune nephritisNCT06553898CD19/CD20Autologous CAR T cellADNCT06462144, NCT06708845,NCT06567080CD7Autologous CAR T cellADNCT05239702 Allogeneic CAR T cellAANCT06622694Dsg3CAAR T cellPVNCT04422912MuSKCAAR T cellMuSK-MGNCT05451212CD20In vivo CAR T cellB-cell CancerNCT06539338CD19/CD20/CD22Autologous CAR T cellSLENCT06653556Abbreviation: AA, aplastic anemia; AAV, ANCA-associated vasculitis; AD, Autoimmune Diseases; AIDNS, autoimmune diseases of the nervous system; AIHA, autoimmune hemolytic anemia; Dsg3, Desmoglein 3; IIMs, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies; ITP, immune thrombocytopenic purpura; LN, lupus nephritis; MG, myasthenia gravis; MS, multiple sclerosis; MuSK-MG, muscle-specific tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis; NMOSD, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder; PV, pemphigus vulgaris; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; RJDM, refractory juvenile dermatomyositis; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; SS, Sjögren’s syndrome; SSc, systemic sclerosis.",

        "Although CAR T cell therapy has attained remarkable outcomes in inducing disease remission, its widespread application for the treatment of autoimmune diseases faces numerous challenges.",
        "Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an inflammatory condition caused by the secretion of cytokines and other immunological proteins from CAR T cells and other immune cells. It is a major challenge in CAR T-cell therapy and typically occurs within 30 days post-infusion.94 Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a severe neurological complication of CAR-T cell therapy. When ICANS occurs alongside or following CRS, it may be associated with CRS. However, ICANS can also develop in the absence of prior or concurrent CRS.56 The incidence and severity of CRS vary across different diseases. In an analysis of 80 patients with autoimmune diseases receiving CAR T-cell therapy, 84% (43 of 51) SLE patients developed CRS up to grade 1, while 56% (9 of 16) SSc patients experienced CRS up to grade 2. Additionally, ICANS occurred in 4 (5%) of the 80 patients.95 For grading criteria on CRS and ICANS, refer to the 2019 ASTCT guidelines.96",
        "IL-6 plays a crucial role in initiating the CRS cascade. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor axis, serves as a primary therapeutic agent for CRS.97 Earlier use of tocilizumab in patients with grade 1 CRS helps prevent progression to more severe CRS.56 Corticosteroids, commonly methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, are another cornerstone therapy for CAR T cell-related CRS and ICANS. Once toxicity is controlled, they should be tapered or discontinued promptly.98 Other medications, such as the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, the IL-6 inhibitor siltuximab, and the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, have also been proposed for the treatment of CRS and ICANS.98",
        "Several risk stratification models are available for predicting the occurrence of severe CRS or ICANS, such as the Endothelial Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) score and modified EASIX formulas.99,100 However, their use is mainly concentrated in the treatment of patients with malignancies, and their predictive efficiency in autoimmune diseases remains to be verified. Compared with hematologic malignancies, the incidence of CRS and ICANS is lower in autoimmune diseases, and CRS is mostly low-grade. This might be due to a significantly reduced number of targeted B cells in autoimmune diseases, leading to a lower toxicity burden.",
        "Local immune effector cell-associated toxicity syndrome (LICATS), a recently documented adverse event specific to autoimmune diseases, has been observed in 77% (30 of 39) of patients with autoimmune diseases treated with CAR T cells.101 This syndrome is characterized by local organ-specific toxicities in organs previously affected by the autoimmune disease and is generally self-limiting. Recognizing LICATS is important for preventing misdiagnosis as CRS or disease relapse, thereby avoiding unnecessary drug use.",
        "Immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT), characterized by cytopenias including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia, is an adverse event following CAR T-cell therapy. However, in the context of CAR T-cell therapy for autoimmune diseases, ICAHT is not frequently observed.95,102 Cytopenias occurring within three weeks after lymphodepletion chemotherapy are common and expected. However, managing prolonged bone marrow suppression beyond 30 days requires a careful differential diagnosis. Treatment may involve transfusions, thrombopoietin, or even hematopoietic cell boosts.103",
        "Patients are particularly vulnerable following CAR-T cell therapy, with infections being a common occurrence. Among the 51 SLE patients who underwent CAR T-cell therapy, 19.6% (10 of 51) experienced non-fatal infections within the first three months post-treatment.95 Moreover, nephrotoxicity associated with CAR-T cell therapy should not be overlooked, particularly when treating autoimmune kidney diseases.104 Finally, the risk of T cell malignancies associated with CAR T-cell therapy deserves our close attention.105",
        "Autologous CAR T therapy is a personalized approach. It incurs high customization costs, involves complex manufacturing processes, requires a long pre-treatment waiting period, and has quality requirements for autologous T cells.106,107 A study has shown that CAR T cells in elderly individuals may have reduced efficacy.108 These factors limit the broad application of CAR T cell therapy.",
        "Before the administration of CAR T cells, lymphodepletion chemotherapy (usually cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) is often required to create a favorable environment for the engraftment and expansion of engineered cells. This approach increases the risks of infertility, neurotoxicity, and infections.109-111 Unlike in cancer therapy, the primary goal of CAR-T cell therapy for autoimmune diseases is immune reset. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy is not a necessary step in this context. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of lymphodepletion-free or very low-dose lymphodepletion regimens in inducing deep disease remission.107,112 The pursuit of minimum effective dose of lymphodepletion chemotherapy, or even the omission of it, is a crucial direction for future CAR-T therapy in autoimmune diseases.",
        "Universal CAR T therapy, known as allogeneic CAR T therapy, involves harvesting T cells from healthy donors for large-scale manufacture of standardized cell products, enabling their off-the-shelf administration (Figure 4). This means CAR T cells are manufactured in advance and can be administered when needed. Consequently, this approach eliminates the traditional waiting period of at least two weeks between apheresis and cell infusion required for autologous products and reduces the risk of manufacturing failure for patients. Additionally, it offers advantages such as lower costs, higher product availability, and the optimization and selection of specific cell types.113",
        "Universal CAR T cells hold significant potential to overcome many limitations of autologous CAR T cells, yet they also have potential downsides and pose different challenges. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and host rejection of CAR T cells are issues that require resolution in the production of universal CAR T cells. Both are mediated by the recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatches by TCRs.114 The production of such T cells requires the application of gene-editing technologies to eliminate the expression of MHC and TCR in donor cells.43 The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) system is a straightforward, highly efficient, and specific gene-editing tool. It allows for the targeted knockout or insertion of genes at specific loci within the T cell genome, thereby lessening the probability of GvHD and minimizing the oncogenic risks associated with random insertions during lentiviral transduction.115-117 Emerging gene-editing technologies, including base editing, prime editing, and programmable addition via site-specific targeting elements editing, have been applied to CAR T cell gene editing. These technologies not only effectively reduce off – target effects and indels but also allow for multiple rounds of editing, enhancing the safety and efficacy of universal CAR T products.118-120",
        "High-quality lymphodepletion is essential for preventing host rejection of universal T cells and GvHD. Gene-edited universal CAR T cells lacking CD52 expression, in combination with anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody-augmented lymphodepletion, enhance lymphodepletion efficacy. In leukemia clinical trials, this augmented lymphodepletion approach has improved the expansion and therapeutic efficacy of universal CAR T cells.121,122",
        "Universal CAR T cells were first applied in humans in 2017, achieving molecular remission in two infants with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.123 Subsequently, with the rapid advancement of gene-editing technologies, universal CAR T cell therapy has developed rapidly and its applications have been expanded to autoimmune diseases. In recent times, allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR T cells engineered using the CRISPR-Cas9 system notably ameliorated the symptoms of one patient diagnosed with immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and two patients with systemic sclerosis. This is the first report on the application of such therapy in the handling of autoimmune diseases, demonstrating its potential and safety.65 Since then, the product has also achieved success in treating refractory SLE patients. Only mild CRS was observed, and no cases of GvHD or ICANS were reported.112,124 Multiple clinical trials currently being conducted to assess the effectiveness of universal CAR T cell therapy targeting autoimmune diseases are expected to accelerate the clinical application of this type of therapy (Table 2).",
        "Traditional CAR T cells, which are originate from αβ T cells, have TCR complexes on their cell surface composed of α and β chains.125 Although current research mainly focuses on improving this type of CAR T cells, in recent years, strategies of using immune cells that do not rely on αβTCR-mediated cytotoxic function to replace αβ T cells in universal CAR cell therapy have gradually become a research hotspot.",
        "NKs are the primary cytotoxic innate lymphoid effector cells and are restricted by MHC specificity. CAR-engineered NKs offer an alternative to CAR T cells. They carry a lower risk of CRS, ICANS, and GvHD, and have the potential to become “off-the-shelf” products.126 In the context of autoimmune diseases, 20 patients with active, severe, and refractory SLE received infusions of allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR NKs at different doses. Among the 8 patients with a follow-up of more than 6 months, 4 achieved DORIS (Definition Of Remission In SLE) remission, and no severe adverse reactions were observed during the treatment.127 Although the efficacy of CAR NKs seems to be inferior to that of CAR T therapy, its acceptable safety profile and universality enable it to be used multiple times. Through further technological improvements, it may be possible for CAR NKs to achieve better clinical outcomes than CAR T cells.",
        "M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) and thrombospondin type 1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) are the main pathogenic autoantigens of PMN.128 In an in vitro experiment, these antigen-specific chimeric autoantigen receptor (CAAR) NKs and T cells specifically eliminated anti-PLA2R1- and anti-THSD7A-secreting cells, demonstrating their great potential for the treatment of PMN.129",
        "γδ T cells are a member of innate T cells, and the TCR on their cell surface is composed of a γ chain and δ chain. Different from traditional αβ T cells, γδ T cells’ killing effect on target cells does not rely on the recognition of classical HLA molecules, which significantly reduces the risk of GvHD, thus making them an ideal carrier for universal CAR cell therapy.130 As early as 20 years ago, researchers attempted to load specific CARs onto γδ T cells and successfully achieved the lysis of target cells.131 Since then, research on γδ T cells has continued to advance. In recent years, multiple clinical studies have confirmed the effectiveness of allogeneic CAR γδ T cells in neoplasms therapy.132,133 This has sparked the researchers’ enthusiasm for applying it in treating autoimmune diseases. Currently, two clinical trials are in progress to explore the safety and feasibility of universal CAR γδ T cell therapy for autoimmune diseases (Table 2). As reported, the CAR γδ T cell product ADI-001 (targeting CD20), used in the aforementioned clinical trials for autoimmune diseases, achieved a complete response rate of 78% in nine patients with B-cell malignancies in another study.134,135 Its efficacy in autoimmune diseases is thus highly anticipated.",
        "Although universal CAR cell products originate from healthy donors, the efficacy of cell products manufactured from different donors may vary. Thus, the criteria for donor selection remain to be explored in practice. Various induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cell types could serve as a significant future source of universal CAR products. iPSCs have diverse sources and can be used to generate virtually any cell type in unlimited quantities.136 The first iPSC-derived universal CAR T cell product has been applied in clinical trials for autoimmune diseases.137,138 According to the latest data, three patients with severe lupus nephritis demonstrated rapid and profound B-cell depletion along with a decrease in disease activity. The first patient, with a follow-up period of 6 months, achieved drug-free remission.139 iPSC-derived CD19 CAR NK cells have completed their first-in-human trial for B-cell malignancies.140 These products could, in theory, be extended to treat autoimmune diseases with the same target.",
        "Invariant Natural Killer T cells, Double-negative T cells, Virus-specific T cells, macrophages, and T memory stem cells are all regarded as potential carriers for universal CAR cell therapy.141 For instance, in a recent animal experiment, CAR macrophages successfully transformed into an anti-inflammatory phenotype in an inflammatory mouse model, thereby ameliorating tissue damage.142 This finding highlights their therapeutic potential for inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune diseases with inflammation-mediated damage. These cells are expected to offer more “off-the – shelf” CAR product options for patients with autoimmune diseases, enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of treatment.",
        "The development of universal cell products represents a significant advancement in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, demonstrating promising efficacy and acceptable safety in early clinical trials. As gene-editing and cell-engineering technologies continue to evolve, universal CAR cell therapies may overcome cost-accessibility barriers, emerging as a widely accessible treatment option for refractory autoimmune diseases.",
        "In vivo CAR T therapy refers to the use of a delivery vector containing gene-editing tools to achieve precise transduction of T cells within the body and generate CAR T cells in situ (Figure 4). This process simplifies and standardizes the manufacturing process for CAR T cells and decreases the risks of CRS and ICANS.143,144",
        "In vivo CAR T therapy utilizes viral vectors to convey the CAR gene, which has successfully generated CAR T cells and achieved targeted B-cell depletion in multiple animal experiments.145-148 Although most current CAR T products use viral vectors for gene delivery, viral transduction has been reported to have potential safety risks.149 Nanocarriers are regarded as a viable alternative vector due to their characteristics of low cytotoxicity, low cost, and ease of use,150 and have shown similar effectiveness to viral vectors in experiments.151-153 In addition, animal experiments using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to accomplish in vivo genome editing have been successful.154-156",
        "Temporarily modifying T cells using mRNA represents another innovative approach. mRNA is unable to integrate into the T cell genome, which helps to limit the risk of uncontrolled expansion of CAR T cells and reduces the likelihood of long-term adverse effects (Figure 4). Moreover, mRNA-based CAR T therapy, which allows for high dose repeated administration without pre-conditioning lymphodepletion chemotherapy, has already been successfully tested in refractory myasthenia gravis cases, thus improving tolerability.85,157 CAR-mRNA can also be used to rapidly generate CAR cells in vivo.158 Application of in vivo CAR cells to clinical practice is accelerating, with the first clinical trial launched159 (Table 2), and with more clinical trials in the pipeline.160 It is believed that with continuous breakthroughs in key bottlenecks such as in vivo targeted delivery, in vivo CAR T therapy will have a promising future.",
        "If the antigen recognized by the pathogenic autoantibody is known, selectively depleting autoantigen-specific B cells while preserving other B cell populations required for protective immunity would appear to be the ideal treatment option. Replacing the antigen-binding domain of the CAR with the target autoantigen gives rise to a CAAR. T cells expressing this CAAR bind to B cells expressing the corresponding B cell receptor, thereby specifically eliminating the autoreactive B cells.161",
        "Pemphigus is a serious autoimmune disease manifested as blistering, mainly caused by autoantibodies against desmoglein (Dsg). In pemphigus vulgaris, autoantibodies predominantly target Dsg3, a critical component of epidermal adhesion.162 In animal experiments, T cells expressing CAAR formed by fusing Dsg3 with CD137-CD3ζ, were infused into a mouse model of pemphigus vulgaris. It was observed that Dsg3-autoreactive B cells were eliminated, the level of autoantibodies decreased, and symptoms such as acantholysis and blister formation were improved.163 In subsequent in vitro experiments, Dsg3-CAAR T cells also specifically depleted Dsg3-specific B cells in the blood of patients with pemphigus vulgaris.164 A clinical trial of Dsg3-CAAR T in pemphigus vulgaris is ongoing, and the results are eagerly anticipated (Table 2). MuSK-CAAR T cells developed for muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) myasthenia gravis demonstrated similar efficacy to anti-CD19 CAR T cells in depleting MuSK-specific B cells in animal experiments, with no reduction in B-cell or total IgG levels.165 At present, Phase 1 clinical trials of this treatment are underway (Table 2). The use of NMDA receptor-CAAR T cells to discriminately eliminate anti-NMDA receptor B cells and pathogenic autoantibodies was successful in a mouse model of autoimmune encephalitis.166 Engineered T cells expressing DNA-CAAR have been developed to target autoimmune B cells producing dsDNA autoantibodies, providing a novel therapeutic approach for lupus nephritis. This method has demonstrated considerable therapeutic potential, supported by encouraging results from an in vitro immune kidney LN organoid model.167 Neutralizing anti – interferon-γ (IFN-γ) autoantibody (nAIGA) can severely compromise immune function. Researchers have successfully utilized IFN-γ CAR-T cells in a mouse model to target nAIGA-expressing cells and B cells from nAIGA patients, offering a new strategy for managing nAIGA-associated infections.168",
        "It is reported that this novel CAAR T cell therapy may generate long-term memory cells.169 This may well be a double-edged sword since in theory, while it has the potential to effectively forestall the recurrence of autoimmune diseases, it simultaneously elevates the risk of adverse reactions. Based on the existing evidence, it is reasonable to infer that immune cells expressing specific CAAR also hold great potential for the treatment of other autoimmune diseases with well-defined pathogenic antigens, including AAV, minimal change disease, and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.170-173 With the deepening of our comprehension regarding the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, personalized therapy targeting specific B cell subsets will have more room for application.",
        "Regulatory T Cells (Tregs) are a subdivision of CD4+ T cells featured by the expression of the transcription factor Forkhead Box P3 (FoxP3), CD25, and CD127. They can inhibit the activities of various immune cells and are crucial for maintaining peripheral immune tolerance174 (Figure 5). Impairment in the quantity or function of Tregs has been identified in multiple autoimmune diseases.175 Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) entails gathering immune cells from the patient’s blood, modifying and expanding them, and then reinfusing them into the patient to achieve therapeutic effects. When the collected immune cells are Tregs, the process is referred to as Treg ACT.176,177 A recent study found that tissue-resident Tregs in different non-lymphoid organs share similar phenotypes and TCR repertoires. This endows them with the ability to migrate across multiple tissues, where they only reside transiently and show no tissue specificity.178 Multiple animal models of autoimmune diseases and mouse models of GvHD have confirmed the inhibitory effect of Treg ACT on autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. However, it has failed to change the ultimate outcome of diseases in clinical trials.179-184 By contrast, antigen-specific Tregs have demonstrated a stronger ability to suppress autoimmunity in animal models.185-188 Antigen-specific Tregs can migrate to target tissues and continuously exert local immunosuppressive responses. Only a handful of these cells are required to control immune responses, and they may also reduce the risk of extensive immunosuppression.189,190\nFigure 5.Major mechanisms of immune regulation by regulatory T cells and mesenchymal stem cells. (A) Regulatory T cells (Tregs) inhibit the immune response through multiple pathways. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) on the surface of Tregs binds to CD80/86 of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), inducing the endocytosis of costimulatory molecules; Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) interacts with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, inhibiting antigen presentation. In this process, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is induced and catalyzes the breakdown of tryptophan into kynurenine, depleting tryptophan and accumulating kynurenine, thereby inhibiting T cell function. Tregs also generate adenosine through the synergistic action of ectoenzymes CD39 (which hydrolyzes ATP to AMP) and CD73 (which converts AMP to adenosine). Adenosine binds to the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) on effector T cells (Teff), inhibiting TCR signaling and reducing IL-2 secretion. Meanwhile, Tregs competitively deprive the microenvironment of IL-2 through the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (CD25), restricting the proliferation of Teff. Some Treg subsets release perforin and granzyme, directly inducing the apoptosis of target cells. In addition, Tregs secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, IL-35, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). By acting on B cells, T cells, and APCs, these cytokines inhibit their pro-inflammatory functions. Furthermore, Tregs transmit inhibitory signals through the interaction between programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD 1), exacerbating T cell exhaustion. (B) The major pathways of immune response regulation by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs inhibit the activity of pro-inflammatory cells through anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10, TGF-β), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), exosomes, and the tryptophan metabolism pathway. These mechanisms work together to induce the differentiation of Tregs and promote the conversion of macrophages from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. In addition, MSCs inhibit the proliferation and functions of T cells and B cells through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. MSCs also inhibit T cell activation by promoting adenosine generation and activating the Fas/FasL pathway. Meanwhile, MSCs inhibit the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells by secreting PGE2 and exosomes, as well as through the tryptophan metabolism pathway.",

        "Genetic engineering techniques to express specific TCRs or CARs on the surface of Tregs are the predominant approach for the artificial generation of antigen-specific Treg cells at present. Transferring recombinant TCR genes into Tregs endows them with the capacity to identify particular antigens presented via MHC molecules on antigen presenting cells.176 The efficacy and safety of this approach have been validated in multiple mouse models of autoimmune diseases. For instance, engineered Treg cell therapy successfully prevented the progression of adoptive transfer mouse models of type 1 diabetes mellitus to diabetes, and effectively induced a reduction in local inflammatory Th17 cells and bone destruction in arthritis models.191,192 TCR-Tregs remain effective even when the antigen concentration is low. Nevertheless, obstacles like the mispairing hybridization of exogenous and endogenous TCR chains frequently restrict the utilization of this approach. Tregs expressing CARs circumvent the TCR-MHC restriction, allowing CAR Tregs to directly interact with target antigens. As a result, they can target a wider variety of tissues. Moreover, CAR Tregs also have a stronger ability to home to inflamed sites.193-195 Preliminary experiments have shown that MOG-targeted CAR Tregs can specifically localize to target tissues, alleviate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis and maintain animal health even after a second inoculation with the encephalitis-inducing inoculum.196,197 Insulin-specific CAR Tregs can exert a sustained and stable inhibitory effect in mice. They can prevent diabetes induced by BDC2.5 T cells (an autoreactive T cell clones) and significantly reduce the occurrence rate of spontaneous diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice.198 In a mouse model of SLE, anti-CD19 CAR Tregs can localize to the sites where B cells function and successfully reduce the production of autoantibodies and tissue damage.199 In a mouse model of vitiligo, CAR Tregs demonstrated superior efficacy in suppressing depigmentation when contrasted with the Tregs control group.200 Such studies stand as evidence for the effectiveness of CAR Tregs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.",
        "At present, the adverse effects of antigen-specific CAR Tregs immunomodulatory therapy remain incompletely characterized. Nevertheless, Tregs do not secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and the researches mentioned above have consistently reported favorable safety profiles for Treg cell therapies. It is anticipated that CAR Tregs will not elicit severe adverse events, including CRS and ICANS.201 However, CAR Tregs present a unique safety concern. Due to the plasticity of Tregs, there is a risk of their transformation into pathogenic T cells.202 Therefore, it is crucial to maintain the stability and durability of Treg cells in an inflammatory environment. Inducing the expression of Foxp3 may be an effective strategy,198,203 and Henschel and colleagues provided evidence that the incorporation of Foxp3 into CAR Tregs enhanced their stability and efficacy,204 and this mechanism currently serves as the principal strategy for augmenting the stability of CAR Tregs. Investigations regarding the utilization of other cytokines (such as IL-2) to enhance Tregs stability are being vigorously pursued.205 Using pro-inflammatory cytokine receptor fragments to replace the scFv in the extracellular domain of CAR can enable Engineered Treg cells to activate specifically in inflamed tissues and inhibit inflammation. This novel strategy has succeeded in a GvHD mouse model, improving tissue inflammation and overall survival, which preliminarily confirms its feasibility in reducing inflammation – mediated tissue damage.206",
        "The successful development of CAR Tregs represents a significant breakthrough in the management of autoimmune diseases, offering a novel immunomodulatory pathway distinct from traditional CAR T cell therapies. Unlike CAR T cells that directly deplete target cells, CAR Tregs modulate immune responses at sites of inflammation with precision, demonstrating broader therapeutic indications and a lower risk of adverse reactions. However, as an emerging therapeutic modality, the efficacy, safety, and stability of CAR Tregs in clinical applications still require further validation through additional clinical trials. Moreover, the CAR constructs on Tregs need to be further optimized to enhance their stability and functionality within the complex immunological microenvironment.",
        "Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are readily accessible pluripotent stem cells endowed with immunomodulative and tissue regenerative capabilities. The mechanisms underlying their suppression of inflammatory responses are multifaceted, primarily encompassing the paracrine secretion of cytokines and exosomes, interactions with diverse immune cells, and the tryptophan metabolic pathway207,208 (Figure 4). MSCs have been extensively utilized in the therapy of diverse immune-mediated diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, and SLE. Moreover, they have got the approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GvHD.209-211 Despite the immense potential that MSCs have demonstrated in the field of immunomodulation, their efficacy remains inconsistent when used as sole agents.212,213",
        "MSCs exhibit inflammation-dependent immunomodulatory functions in different environments. Their therapeutic efficacy hinges on their ability to migrate to the injured sites, adhere to, and integrate into the target tissues.214,215 Genetic engineering of MSCs to express CARs confers antigen-specific targeting capabilities, enhancing their localization to diseased tissues.216 In the field of anti-tumor therapy, the strategy of using CARs to localize MSCs to tumor sites can enhance the anti-tumor capabilities of MSCs.217 In a xenograft model of GvHD, CAR MSCs precisely localized and migrated toward inflamed sites expressing target antigens. This effectively inhibited T cell activation and promoted the generation of Tregs, thereby significantly improving the overall survival rate of mice.216 In an in vitro cell-coculture experiment, CD19 CAR-engineered MSCs were able to specifically enhance the inhibition of CD19+ B cell activity, and thereby improves the controllability of MSC-based immunotherapy and offers a novel therapeutic approach for autoimmune diseases.218",
        "Preliminary research endeavors have illustrated the practicability of using CAR MSCs for the precise suppression of autoimmune responses. However, before their clinical application, in-depth research is still required to address the following key issues: First, the compatibility between MSCs from different sources and different types of CARs; second, the impact of CAR loading on MSCs, including functionality and persistence; third, whether the exosomes released by CAR MSCs can be taken up and influence or enhance the functions of other immune cells; and fourth, the proliferation, persistence, and safety of CAR MSCs in vivo.",
        "Within autoimmune diseases, T cells can exert pathogenic effects either through directly inflicting damage on host tissues or by assisting B cells in producing autoantibodies.219 Strategies using CAR to directly target T cells are also under exploration. CD5 and CD7 are expressed on almost all T cells, yet they are not essential for T cell development or function, making them ideal therapeutic targets.220,221 To prevent fratricide effects during the engineering of CD5- or CD7-targeted CAR T cells, genetic ablation of the corresponding surface antigen (CD5/CD7) is required.222,223 This category of CAR T cells has shown remarkable efficacy in clinical studies for treating T-cell malignancies,224 and one study is ongoing in autoimmune diseases (Table 2). A recent study has found that using NKs instead of T cells as effector cells can help to avoid fratricide of engineered cells and improve the T cells depletion rate.225",
        "Autoreactive B cells are common in the normal B cell repertoire and they mainly produce cross-reactive, low-affinity IgM antibodies. However, the development of autoimmune diseases requires high-affinity pathogenic antigen-specific antibodies that are the products of plasma cells produced in germinal centers.226-228 Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) mediate the positive and negative selection of B cells in germinal centers. When the Tfh cell count increases abnormally, it may lead to autoimmunity and disease.229-231",
        "Germinal center Tfh cells characteristically express high levels of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and circulating Tfh cells with high PD-1 expression can effectively promote antibody responses.232,233 Research has demonstrated that PD-1-CAR T cells can effectively eliminate Tfh cells.234 Reighard et al. designed PD-L1-CAR NKs that successfully and selectively eliminated Tfh cells in vitro without affecting B cells or Treg cells. Its efficacy was also demonstrated in a lupus mouse model.235 These pieces of evidence demonstrate that targeting PD-1 to eliminate Tfh cells may be a hopeful approach to the treatment of autoimmune diseases.",
        "Compared with the vigorous development of B-cell depletion therapies, T-cell depletion strategies are still in their infancy in the field of autoimmune disease treatment. Although preliminary explorations on the potential value of CAR immunotherapy for targeted T cell depletion in the treatment of autoimmune diseases have occurred, sufficient clinical trials to support it use are lacking.",
        "The strategy of total T-cell depletion has obtained outstanding results in the therapy of T-cell malignancies, with significant adverse reactions. The potential benefits and risks of this approach to the treatment of autoimmune diseases must be carefully weighed.236 Future treatment strategies need to find ways precisely eliminate pathogenic T cell subsets while maximally preserving the body’s beneficial immune protection function. This challenging task not only relies on in-depth exploration of the complex pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases to clarify the specific mechanisms and key nodes of T cell involvement in the disease process but also involves the precise selection of appropriate T cell subset targets to achieve precision treatment.",
        "CAR-based immunotherapy represents the most innovative form of cell therapy at present. It has been triumphantly and effectively integrated into the treatment regimen of autoimmune diseases and has demonstrated great potential in eliminating pathogenic cells and improving disease prognosis in numerous studies. However, CAR-based immunotherapy aimed at autoimmune diseases is yet in its infancy. It has not yet been sanctioned by regulatory powers for autoimmune indications, and substantial clinical data are required to verify its long-term safety and effectiveness.",
        "In preliminary explorations, the selection of cell types and the design of CAR structures have been proven to be closely related to the feasibility, effectiveness, durability, and safety of treatment. Additionally, the selection of therapeutic targets appropriate for different refractory autoimmune diseases is also key to treatment success. Ensuring accessibility of these advanced treatments is also an important research task so that all patients with autoimmune diseases can benefit.",

        "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease affecting multiple joints symmetrically.1 The main symptoms at the early stage of the disease are joint pain and swelling; at late stage, arthritis leads to joint stiffness, malformation, loss of function, and even disability.2 Currently, available medication for RA treatment has limited efficacy, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and immunosuppressants.3 The target cytokine therapy has some therapeutic effects but without significant repair of injured joints, which restricts its widespread clinical use.",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are characterized by their regenerative property to repair parenchymal tissue and organs through differentiating into lineages of mesenchymal tissues, as well as immunomodulation.4 Injected MSCs can migrate to injured tissues and facilitate the recovery of damaged cells.5 Clinical studies have demonstrated the clinical benefits of MSCs in RA therapy.6 However, the therapeutic benefits of umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) for the treatment of RA have not been well studied clinically. As is known that the key factor in the pathogenesis of RA is the elevated cytokines arising from numerous synovial cells.7 MSCs can express various receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines8 to reduce inflammation in RA patients. We have previously reported the safety and efficacy of UC-MSC for the treatment of RA patients for up to 8 months after UC-MSC infusion.9 The aim of this 3-year cohort study is to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of UC-MSC plus DMARDs therapy for RA.

        "According to the clinical relief of American Rheumatism Association’s standard clinical relief of RA10 should meet at least 4 of the 5 following criteria: morning stiffness time is less than 15 mins; no fatigue sensation; no joint pain and tenderness; no joint swelling; ESR was less than 30 mm/h in women and 20 mm/h in men. Obvious relief means that in addition to meet 4 of the above 5 criteria, ESR and CRP each improvement of 50%, and RF decreased by more than 30%. Effective criteria are to meet half of the above obvious effect criteria. Invalid effect criteria means that patients who fail to reach 3 of the 6 criteria for obvious effect or RA condition worsens. The DAS28 was used to assess the disease status, with examining the number of tenderness (T28) and swelling joints (SW28). The pain score (0–10) was used to assess the patients' pain status during the follow-up. Before treatment,1 patient had no pain (score 0), 16 patients had minor pain (score 1–3), 28 patients had moderate pain (score 4–6), 19 patients had severe pain (score 7–10).

        "In our previous report,9,12 we have shown the UC-MSC treatment was safe and effective in clinical treatment. We observed the patients up to 8 months after UC-MSC treatment in RA patients, which no acute serious side-effects occurred either during or after UC-MSCs infusion, and only few patients (4%) showed mild adverse effects such as flu-like symptoms during the infusion, which disappeared within hours without any treatment. All patients have shown improvements in the diet, sleep, and physical strength after the cell therapy based on patients’ reports. In comparison, there was no such improvement in the control group. In addition, the clinical response to UC-MSCs treatment was rapid (as early as 12 h posttreatment) with the physical evidence after the administration of UC-MSCs. In the placebo group, no significant changes in symptoms were detected throughout the study.",
        "This 3-year cohort study of UC-MSC therapy for RA was aimed to provide further data on the long-term safety and efficacy of UC-MSC treatment. The results demonstrated that DMARD drug combined with UC-MSCs therapy alleviated RA symptoms, reduced HAQ and DAS28 scores, as well as reduced levels of RF, CRP, ESR, and anti-CCP and the effects maintained for 3 years after UC-MSC treatment.",
        "Traditional therapy for RA includes DMARDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs (SAARDs) and hormone drugs,13 with high disease recurrence rate and side effects after long-term use.14 Treatments with hormone for a long time can result in reduced immunity and osteoporosis with sodium and water retention. Thus, such treatments have poor patient compliance. Most importantly, they cannot change the progress of the disease. Besides joint injury, RA also affects multiple tissues and organs. Traditional drug therapy could not perform the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues.",
        "In recent years, cytokine targeted therapies have been developed, such as TNF-competitive inhibitor Etanercept and TNF-monoclonal antibody Infliximab,15 which have been widely used to inhibit the proliferation of synovial cells, reduce the release of inflammatory factors and achieve the effect of anti-inflammatory and improvement of RA symptoms.16 However, Bongartz et al17 found that the use of TNF-inhibitors is likely to increase the occurrence of various post-operative infections, and has no obvious ability to repair damaged joints, thus limiting its clinical use. Currently, refractory RA cannot be well controlled by the available clinical treatments. Some patients are intolerant to certain immunosuppressive agents, which limits the scope of drug use. Therefore, new treatments need to be explored.",
        "With the development of bioengineering and cell biology, the research on stem cells continues to spread, and the application of stem cell therapy for RA will become popular. Mesenchymal stem cells have biological characteristics of regenerative repair of parenchymal tissues and organs and immune regulation, providing a new prospect for the treatment of RA.18,19 In our study, the levels of rheumatoid factors and anti-CCP antibodies showed a slow decline, and some of them were even on the high side. The data even reached >500, because the immunomodulation process of different patients has an individual difference and it is a tardiness process, so the rate of decline varies from person to person.",
        "Based on the extensive and in-depth research on UC-MSC, UC-MSC should function in different aspects in the treatment of RA. Firstly, basic studies have confirmed that MSCs can differentiate into osteoblasts, cartilage, fat, tendon, muscle and other cells in vitro and in vivo,20 which may participate in the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues. Secondly, joint lesions can promote the aggregation of MSCs to the lesion synovium to repair the damaged joint tissue.21 Chen et al22 reported the feasibility of using MSCs to construct bone and cartilage combined grafts, and confirmed that adding MSCs into solid supports can promote the repair of cartilage defects. In a mice model of arthritis, single intraperitoneal injection of primary mouse MSCs prevented severe damage to the affected bone and cartilage.23 Thirdly, MSCs secrete a variety of cytokines with nutritional effects and can promote the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells.24 Fourthly, MSCs have unique immunomodulatory effects. When added into the mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte culture system, both autogenous and allogeneic MSCs can significantly inhibit the proliferation and activation of T lymphocytes, which plays an important role in the regulation of the immune network and is expected to fundamentally adjust the pathological immune system of patients.25 In addition, when MSCs differentiate into other types of cells, it still retains its immunomodulatory effect;26 Fifthly, MSCs have a chemotaxis effect, which can prevent the release of inflammatory mediators, reduce the inflammatory reaction and tissue damage, and disease progression.27,28",
        "In this study, after the treatment of UC-MSC for RA patients, personalized low dose of DMARDs therapy was maintained for a long time. The serological indexes of the patients were stable for a long time, reaching the low activity level of RA, which was consistent with the improved clinical symptoms. Therefore, UC-MSC therapy is safe for RA treatment. UC-MSC cell combined with DMARDs treatment can maintain low disease activity and improve the quality of life for RA patients for a long time. The underlying mechanism may be related to UC-MSC’s ability to regulate patients’ autoimmune tolerance and improve the tolerance of anti-rheumatism drugs for RA patients.29–31",
        "This study supplements the data of our previous studies and provides the supportive evidence of long-term safety and efficiency in the use of UC-MSC therapy for RA. The limitation of the current study is that all patients were enrolled and treated from a single center, and there is no placebo control for the long-term observation. Therefore, a larger multiple-center, controlled study needs to be confirmed to confirm the current findings. However, the result of this study supported the use of UC-MSC infusion for RA treatment, as all patients failed traditional drug treatment and obtained symptom improvements and evaluation index decrease after UC-MSC treatment.",
        "Overall, our study demonstrated the long-term safety and efficacy of UC-MSC therapy in RA patients. The therapeutic effects of UC-MSC can be maintained for 3 years, with stable clinical outcomes, which significantly improved RA patients’ quality of life.",

        "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of severe long-term pain and disability affecting approximately 10% of the global population1. Regenerative solutions and new tissue- engineering based strategies are promising for treatment of moderate OA2,3. The research for treatment of knee OA with PRP is promising4–6, however there is a lack of consensus regarding the preparation of standardized dosing with an appropriate absolute number of platelets and concentration.

The overall difference between the PRP and control groups at one year strongly suggests the efficacy of PRP as a treatment for OA. As expected, the study demonstrated no structural efficacy of PRP unlike cellular therapy9. We observed, however, that PRP had a chondro-protective structural benefit in terms of better maintenance of the JSW and cartilage thickness as an outcome measure.",
        "Our results correlates well with earlier studies10–12 although, direct comparison is difficult because of differences in PRP processing, the dose (quantity and concentration of platelets), and no standard structural efficacy criteria. Despite all these odds a recent meta-analysis of 30 RCT demonstrated best overall outcome in patients treated with PRP as compared to control, HA or steroids at 3, 6, 12 months follow up intervals13 which correlated well with our results. In a randomized study with PRP and HA treatment the IKDC score was significantly higher in the PRP group at 24 and 52 weeks (P < 0.01)14. Similarly, significant improvements were demonstrated in our PRP group for IKDC scores (P < 0.05) at 12 weeks15. Another study reported improvement in IKDC scores despite the absolute number of platelets injected being very low at 6.5 million per knee16. A single dose of PRP in 22 patients (ages of 30–70 years) with early knee OA improved pain function scores at 6 months and 1 year. No visible changes on MRI were found in at least 73% of the patients at 1 year17. Our study however included elderly and moderate OA patients with a positive outcome.",
        "A significant improvement in WOMAC scores within 2–3 weeks with worsening at 6-months was reported after treatment with two injections of WBC-filtered PRP with an average absolute count of 23.85 billion platelets injected per knee17. Our study shows maintained effectiveness at one year after a single injection. WOMAC and IKDC scores were previously shown to be significantly better with PRP than HA injections (P < 0.001) in four randomized controlled trials18.",
        "We also evaluated the clinical correlation of the pro inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α with WOMAC scores at 3 months in the PRP and HA groups. Our data suggests that decrease in inflammatory cytokines in the knee with subsequent clinical improvement in patient-reported outcomes at 3 months are time dependent. We did not find any statistical difference in levels of cytokines between groups. Cytokine levels were correlated with the degree of pain as previous study19.",
        "Minimal manipulated processing and optimal dose of platelets is very crucial in PRP to obtain clinically effective results20,21. Obtaining PRP is often expensive and could be restrictive in developing countries with inadequacy of resources. Most of the “manual” methods have drawback as many platelets are lost if not filtered. Our novel methodology with indigenous one-micron filters recovered them from the PPP improving yield upto 92%.",

However American academy of orthopedic surgeons AAOS (2013) and American college of Rheumatology ACR (2020) recommended against use of HA and considered that it is not medically necessary for the treatment of pain30. Heterogeneous trial results conflicting conclusions, and flaws in interpreting data make literature interpretations very confusing. However majority have reported clinically important reductions in pain and excellent safety profile31.",
        "We used inactivated PRP as it increases proliferation of the mesenchymal stem cells fivefold32, improves cartilage, and aids in bone formation. Activated PRP may inhibit chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in vivo33. Need of activation of PRP prior to injection is an issue on ongoing Debate. Several studies have reported that activation of PRP before joint injection ensure that signaling elements are released during fibrin retraction and fibrinolysis34 hence better results on degenerative cartilage lesions20.",
        "MRI interpretations methodology of our study for minor improvements in cartilage is too small to be consistently and reliably picked up. In present study MRI evaluation should have beenwithT2wetmaps. Mere addressing the cartilage loss would be unlikely to succeed in OA treatment if not focused on correcting the abnormal mechanics and ligament laxity35. Approximately 50%of the patients with radiological changes of OA are asymptomatic because articular cartilage is not innervated36 hence in many situations despite chondroprotection provided by PRP pain may persist.",
        "The strengths of our study are the structural and physiological evaluation, standardized PRP processing with little variation, and a very high level of consistency in absolute platelet counts (≥ 10 billion) in 8 ml which we hope will help in standardizing the dosage for treatment. “The major limitation of our study was the absence of a true control group using saline. The study did not address implication of PRP in advanced OA. Besides small sample size and assessment in limited time frame, the study was limited by variable doses (different combination of absolute number and concentration of platelets in PRP) evaluation.",
        "Our study provides evidence that clinical outcome does not only depend upon the concentration, but also on the absolute platelet count. We delivered a standardized PRP dose with little variation. Injecting 8 ml PRP in joint space through supra lateral approach does not produce any distension or swelling and is safe as knee joint has large volume and surface area37. Critical dose is important for sustained therapeutic effect. We have observed sustained therapeutic benefit with dose of 10 billion platelets in 8 ml volume of PRP. It can be hypothesized that higher platelet counts will ultimately lead to high growth factors release hence generate better outcome. However further studies are needed to evaluate if still higher doses (more than 10 billion) are more beneficial or counterproductive and similarly higher concentration (less volume of PRP with 10 billion platelets) would yield the same result.",

        "In this article we focus on a pharmacologic strategy for managing patients with chronic inflammatory periodontal disease. This strategy, termed “host‐modulation therapy”, was developed almost 3 decades ago by Golub et al1, 2. To date, the only host‐modulation therapy used clinically in the USA (approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) and beyond (Canada, Europe) is a nonantibiotic formulation of doxycycline, a member of the tetracycline antibiotics (discussed below). This seemingly counterintuitive approach arose from seminal discovery experiments more than 3 decades ago,3, 4, 5, 6, 7 which resulted in an initial series of review articles a few years later that proposed the clinical use of this nonantibiotic formulation as a novel, safe, and effective therapeutic strategy as an adjunct to scaling and root planing. 1, 2, 6, 7 This strategy has also been tested in surgical regimens of periodontal therapy.9",
        "As reviewed in several publications since, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 2 major categories of host‐modulation therapy have received the most attention. The first category modulates the host's inflammatory response either by inhibition18 or, as described more recently, by resolution.15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21 The second category (the main focus of this chapter) modulates the host's pathologic collagenolytic response in the soft tissues (gingiva and periodontal ligament), as well as the alveolar bone. It should be stressed that collagens in periodontal tissues, comprised mostly of type I but also other collagens, such as type III, are the major structural proteins of all of these soft and calcified tissues. In fact, this ubiquitous fibrous protein comprises over 90% of the organic matrix of the calcified periodontal tissues, the bone, and the cementum, and about 60% of the gingiva and periodontal ligament.1, 2",
        "Regarding the first category of host‐modulation therapies,2 approaches have been intensively investigated. The earliest studies involved nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, but this strategy has been rejected. In brief, the nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug that received the most attention in animal studies, and then in clinical trials, was flurbiprofen. Similar to other nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, flurbiprofen suppresses the host's inflammatory response, including its well‐known mediators (eg, prostanoids, cytokines), but also inhibits osteoclast activity and bone resorption.18 However, because of significant adverse events in long‐term clinical trials testing nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug efficacy in periodontal patients, including a rebound effect of accelerated alveolar bone loss after cessation of this drug,22 these compounds have not been approved for clinical use as a host modulator by governmental regulatory agencies in any country.",
        "In contrast to nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, there is great interest in a new category of host‐modulation therapies to regulate inflammation. These novel compounds, the resolvins, do not suppress acute inflammation, which is essential to combat infection and to promote optimal wound healing, but they do prevent its prolongation. These compounds include derivatives of omega‐3 fatty acids, docosahexanoic acid, eicosapentanoic acid, as well as lipoxins derived from arachidonic acid.19, 20, 21 These host‐modulation therapies are not discussed herein as they are detailed in another article in this volume.",
        "The primary focus of this article is the second category of host‐modulation therapies (see above), which modulate the host's pathologic collagenolytic response during periodontitis and other diseases.1, 2, 23 One group of these drugs is based on novel nonantibiotic modifications of tetracyclines (notably doxycycline). The formulations include 2 Food and Drug Administration (and Canada and Europe)‐approved medications for the management of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease and chronic inflammatory skin disease, and both are administered systemically by the oral route. They include Periostat®, now generic, and Oracea®, the latter widely prescribed by dermatologists and some periodontists.2, 13, 24 The only nonantimicrobial compositions of tetracyclines, i.e., chemically‐modified tetracycline‐3: CMT‐3 [6‐demethyl 6‐deoxy 4‐de‐dimethylamino tetracycline], also known as COL‐3, that has been tested in preliminary clinical trials on patients, are those with periodontal disease 25 and in patients with cancer (Kaposi's sarcoma).26 However, none of the chemically modified tetracyclines has been government approved for treating patients in any country.",
        "The second group of novel anticollagenolytic compounds has not yet been approved for clinical use in humans, but has demonstrated safety and efficacy in various animal (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog) models of periodontal disease and relevant medical diseases, such as arthritis, diabetes, and cancer. These compounds are novel chemical modifications of curcumin, the key ingredient of the natural spice, turmeric. In this review, we focus on the most promising of this category, chemically modified curcumin‐2.24, a triketonic phenylaminocarbonyl curcumin (similar in structure to natural diketonic curcumin but different from other diketonics, like the tetracyclines), and its mechanisms of action as a pleiotropic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor for inflammatory/collagenolytic diseases.27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32",
        "To complete this chapter, other host‐modulation strategies will be briefly addressed, including the sirtuins and resveratrol.",
        "Since the initial discovery experiments of Golub et al,5, 6 over 40 years ago (see below), the earliest review articles detailing the previously unrecognized multiple mechanisms of action of tetracycline antibiotics, as host modulators, were those published by the same group.1, 2 These research efforts focused on: (1) the ability of different formulations of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline and compositions (eg, the chemically modified tetracyclines) as nonantimicrobial tetracyclines, to inhibit the pathologic breakdown of collagen‐rich tissues, including the resorption of bone; and (2) to explain their mechanisms of action, which are outlined in Table 1 and are discussed briefly below. More than 10 years later, the field had expanded so dramatically in both dentistry and medicine that 2 issues of Pharmacological Research\n33, 34 were published following a number of related scientific symposia (eg, the New York Academy of Science, The Gordon Research Conferences, etc.) dedicated to the multiple clinical uses of these tetracycline‐based host modulators (mostly doxycycline) for a number of “inflammatory/collagenolytic” diseases, including (but not limited to) periodontitis, arthritis, dermatologic diseases, cardiovascular and lung diseases, and cancer. In addition, the discovery of tetracyclines as host modulators for various medical as well as dental diseases was highlighted in 2 editorials published in JAMA.35, 36",

        "“Upregulated” collagen synthesis, osteoblast activity, and bone formation",
        "Modified from Golub et al.2",
        "As background, and of relevance to the drug‐discovery experiments (for more detail, see Golub et al1, 2), a series of studies was designed to elucidate abnormalities in collagen structure, synthesis, crosslinking/maturation, and degradation, as a complication of experimental diabetes. These experiments led to the discovery that this hyperglycemic state upregulated the synthesis and secretion of the only host‐derived neutral proteinases, the collagenases (ie, matrix metalloproteinase‐1, ‐8, and ‐13), capable of degrading the triple‐helical collagen molecule under physiologic conditions of pH and temperature.4, 37 Consistent with this observation, diabetes was also found to result in accelerated aging of collagen in connective tissues (including gingiva, skin, bone matrix), characterized by a reduction in the ratio of newly synthesized uncrosslinked (soluble) collagen to older highly crosslinked (insoluble) collagen. The production of excess collagenase provided a mechanism (in addition to decreased procollagen synthesis and excessive lysyl oxidase/crosslinking enzyme activity), the newly synthesized collagen is much more susceptible to collagenolytic attack than the older “leather‐like” highly crosslinked collagen. Also consistent with the high level of diabetes‐induced pathologically‐excessive matrix metalloproteinase (collagenolytic) activity was the excessive urinary excretion of hydroxyproline (an amino acid unique to collagen molecules), compared with that in normal glycemic rats, and the accelerated breakdown of the collagen‐rich periodontal (and other) tissues often seen in patients with diabetes.4, 37 As discussed below, these observations of accelerated breakdown of recently synthesized collagen, mediated by excessive matrix metalloproteinase activity in rats with diabetes, has been translated into clinical applications. In this regard, Frankwich et al38 reported that the treatment of obese patients with type 2 diabetes, with the doxycycline‐based matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor detailed below, “resulted in decreased inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity.” The mechanism proposed was that pathologically elevated matrix metalloproteinase activity during diabetes, which is known to degrade the insulin receptor (thus impairing glucose metabolism), was significantly reduced by a 3‐month treatment with doxycycline, a proven matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor. Earlier, Lauhio et al 39 had shown that matrix metalloproteinase‐8 is effective in degrading the membrane‐bound insulin receptor. 39",
        "This background on diabetes‐induced collagen molecular pathology resulted in the discovery experiments on the unexpected ability of tetracyclines to inhibit host‐derived matrix metalloproteinase activity by mechanisms unrelated to their antibiotic activity. The rationale for these experiments, and the resulting development of nonantibacterial tetracycline formulations and compositions, is reviewed below (for additional details, see references1, 2, 13, 24).",
        "Moreover, the beneficial therapeutic results from a number of clinical trials in which the administration of the nonantimicrobial doxycycline‐based host‐modulation drug was tested as an adjunct to scaling and root planing have been reviewed over several decades, including the following reports: (1) the American Dental Association evidence‐based guidelines, which supported this adjunctive treatment as safe and effective, whereas other local (ie, sustained‐release antibiotics or antiseptics, as well as photodynamic and laser therapies) and systemic (azithromycin and ampicillin antibiotic) treatments were not recommended;40, 41 and (2) several meta‐analyses, which also supported the efficacy of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal therapy.14, 42, 43 Moreover, it should also be mentioned that in an extensive, multicenter, 6‐month clinical trial of 180 patients, scaling and root planing combined with systemically administered subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline (host‐modulation therapy) and a topically applied antimicrobial (Atridox®) resulted in a significantly greater clinical improvement compared with scaling and root planing alone.44",
        "The discovery experiments, which ultimately resulted in the first (and still the only) government‐approved host‐modulation drug for periodontal disease, have been described in several additional published studies,1, 5, 6, 10 and the reader is referred to these and other articles for details. It should also be recognized that not only is nonantibiotic doxycycline (also known as subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline) the only host‐modulation therapy available by prescription for the management of periodontitis (Periostat®), a modified once‐a‐day sustained‐release version of nonantibiotic doxycycline is also the only matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor drug available by prescription to dermatologists (Oracea®), although it and Periostat® can be prescribed off‐label for other dental and medical clinical applications. Other experimental matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, commonly based on zinc‐binding hydroxamic acid peptides, have been found to be potent inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, but have resulted in significant clinical adverse events, as it is now recognized that low levels of these neutral proteinases are required to maintain normal physiologic connective tissue turnover.12, 23, 45",
        "Thus, with the early discovery of excessive matrix metalloproteinase activity and abnormal collagen turnover in the gingival tissues of rats with diabetes (and, later, in humans with diabetes), 2 competing hypotheses were proposed to explain the mechanisms of accelerated periodontal breakdown during this systemic disease and which resulted in drug discovery.2, 5",
        "Hypothesis 1: Diabetes and hyperglycemia alter the oral and crevicular environment (eg, oxygen levels, pH), thus promoting the overgrowth of anaerobic gram‐negative bacteria. This pathogenic microflora could then result in elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) in the gingival crevice in individuals with diabetes, which would induce pathologically excessive host‐derived expression of collagenase, and consequent breakdown of collagen, in the adjacent gingival tissues; orHypothesis 2: Diabetes increases gingival collagenase activity and pathologic collagen breakdown by mechanisms independent of any bacterial “shifts” and reflects, instead, a diabetes‐induced alteration in the host response.",
        "Hypothesis 1: Diabetes and hyperglycemia alter the oral and crevicular environment (eg, oxygen levels, pH), thus promoting the overgrowth of anaerobic gram‐negative bacteria. This pathogenic microflora could then result in elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) in the gingival crevice in individuals with diabetes, which would induce pathologically excessive host‐derived expression of collagenase, and consequent breakdown of collagen, in the adjacent gingival tissues; or",
        "Hypothesis 2: Diabetes increases gingival collagenase activity and pathologic collagen breakdown by mechanisms independent of any bacterial “shifts” and reflects, instead, a diabetes‐induced alteration in the host response.",
        "To identify which of these 2 hypotheses was correct, the tetracycline antibiotic, minocycline, was administered to rats with diabetes to suppress the diabetes‐induced altered crevicular microflora (hypothesis 1), and was found to reduce substantially the excessive host‐derived collagenase activity (in the absence of any reduction of hyperglycemia). These observations initially appeared to support hypothesis 1. However, when the experiment was repeated using germ‐free rats, maintained in germ‐free environments, minocycline therapy again reduced the pathologically excessive gingival collagenase activity in the rats with diabetes back to normal rat levels. These observations eliminated hypothesis 1 and supported hypothesis 2. Moreover, these data, plus additional in vivo and in vitro (mechanistic) studies, clearly demonstrated that tetracyclines (minocycline, doxycycline, other tetracyclines) had a previously unrecognized ability to inhibit mammalian (host) tissue‐derived collagenases (and later, other matrix metalloproteinases), and by mechanisms independent of their antibiotic activity (outlined in Table 1).2, 5 These findings immediately drove the development of nonantimicrobial formulations (of which doxycycline was found to be the most potent matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor) and compositions (the chemically modified tetracyclines, such as chemically modified tetracycline‐3; discussed below) of tetracyclines that would not result in the side effect of antibiotic‐resistant bacteria and fungal overgrowth with long‐term administration, as prolonged treatment would be needed to modulate the host response.",
        "Golub et al2 then designed 2 strategies of drug development to suppress connective tissue breakdown, including bone loss during periodontitis, and other dental and medical diseases, using nonantibacterial tetracyclines. Both strategies have recently been reviewed by this group.13, 24 In brief, the first strategy involved the custom formulation, then testing, of capsules containing standard levels of doxycycline (50 and 100 mg), which have antibiotic activity, as well as capsules containing lower levels of doxycycline (30, 20, and 10 mg), which are recognized to have non therapeutic antibiotic activity. In this program of design and testing, the 20 mg formulation in clinical studies was found to produce peak blood levels that were significantly lower than the >1.0 μg/mL needed for antibiotic activity. This low‐dose formulation yielded peak blood levels of 0.3‐0.6 μg/mL compared with peak blood levels for the antibiotic (100 mg) doxycycline dose of 2‐5 μg/mL. Unlike the antibiotic regimen, which is known to result in antibiotic‐resistant bacteria in a short period of time (eg, 2 weeks),46 the regimen of 20 mg twice a day (once every 12 hours) showed no evidence, in long‐term clinical trials, of antibiotic resistance in the oral microflora or in the microflora from the intestine, vagina, and skin.8, 47 Similarly, the sustained‐release once‐per‐day formulation (Oracea®) of nonantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline did not result in the emergence of antibiotic‐resistant bacterial strains13, 24, 49. More recently, a National Institutes of Health‐funded clinical trial on 128 postmenopausal women found that a 2‐year regimen of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline (20 mg twice a day) showed no difference compared with placebo capsules (vehicle only) in the emergence of an antibiotic‐resistant microflora47, 50, 51 and no difference in adverse events between the control and subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline groups over this prolonged period of time (Table 2). However, consistent with medical applications of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline, the women on the 2‐year regimen of the Food and Drug Administration‐approved dental medication did show a statistically significant reduction in dermatologic adverse events (Table 2) as well as statistically significant improvements in periodontal disease and systemic biologic parameters (Table 3). Beneficial long‐term results were also seen in clinical trials on patients with rheumatoid arthritis,52 acne,49 and other medical conditions, as discussed later in this review.",

        "As reviewed by our group and others,1, 2, 11, 13, 14 the repeated demonstration of tetracycline's unexpected ability, by nonantibiotic mechanisms, to inhibit pathologic collagenolysis (including bone loss) during periodontal diseases and other diseases, drove the development of 2 novel, systemically administered, therapeutic regimens: (a) nonantibiotic formulations of doxycycline, Food and Drug Administration‐approved for the treatment of periodontitis (Periostat®, now generic) and acne/rosacea (Oracea®) (both medications have also been approved in Canada as Periostat® and Apprilon® and in Europe as Periostat® and Efracea®) and (b) a series of nonantibacterial compositions of tetracyclines. These novel compounds were created by structural modification (removal of the dimethylamino group at the carbon‐4 site of the A ring), which eliminated their antibacterial activity. However, they were also designed to retain and enhance the ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase activity, in part by preserving the zinc‐ and calcium‐binding beta‐diketone moiety at carbon‐11 and carbon‐12 of the tetracycline molecule. It should be noted that confirmation of this beta‐diketone as the active site for matrix metalloproteinase inhibition was achieved by structurally eliminating this cation‐binding moiety. This was accomplished by converting the tetracycline molecule to its pyrazole analog, which lacks this metal ion‐binding site, and, which, as a result, did not inhibit matrix metalloproteinases. One of the most potent chemically modified tetracyclines as a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, chemically modified tetracycline‐3, has been tested in phase I and phase II clinical trials by the National Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, and in much lower doses in preliminary studies on patients with chronic periodontitis.25, 26 The results of these studies are presented later in this review.",
        "As described earlier, a number of studies over the past several decades have demonstrated that scaling and root planing plus host‐modulation therapy, with subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline as the adjunct, produced improved clinical results compared with scaling and root planing plus a placebo, as assessed by traditional diagnostic measures, including probing depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, radiographic bone loss,2, 11, 44, 53 and reduced biomarkers/mediators of inflammatory/collagenolytic disease, including cytokines and chemokines (interleukin‐1beta, tumor necrosis factor‐alpha, interleukin‐6, interleukin‐17, monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1),22, 54 matrix metalloproteinases (notably matrix metalloproteinase‐8 and matrix metalloproteinase‐9), pyridinoline bone type I collagen breakdown fragments, or type I collagen carboxyterminal telopeptide (ICTP) and, by indirect mechanisms of action, also inhibited elastase (serpinolytic) activity. This therapeutic regimen also reduced pathologically excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (eg, sodium hypochlorous acid) and nitric oxide in gingival crevicular fluid and in the adjacent gingival tissues.1, 2, 54, 55 These and other observations are summarized in Tables 1 and 3. In addition, Lee et al55 reported that a novel combination host‐modulation therapeutic regimen (subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline plus low‐dose flurbiprofen) enhanced the efficacy of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline in suppressing matrix metalloproteinases, in addition to reducing serpinolytic (alpha1‐antitrypsin‐degrading) activity, as a result of the ability of the nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug to enhance the delivery of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor drug to the inflamed tissues, including the diseased gingiva and the arthritic joint.55, 56, 57",
        "Of particular interest regarding the clinical efficacy of nonantimicrobial tetracyclines (especially doxycycline, a more potent matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor than tetracycline itself, or minocycline) as host modulators, is the issue of substantivity, which reflects the ability of the medication to produce a therapeutic effect for some time after drug administration has stopped.",
        "In early studies, Golub et al6 administered subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline to patients with periodontitis for 2 weeks (control subjects received placebo capsules twice a day) and reported “that this regimen dramatically reduced the mammalian collagenase activity, not only in the gingival crevicular fluid, but also in the adjacent gingival tissues that were surgically excised for therapeutic purposes.” However, subsequent clinical trials indicated that although increasing the regimen of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline to 4 weeks also reduced periodontitis biomarkers, cessation of host‐modulation therapy resulted in a rapid rebound of collagenase activity back to placebo levels.10, 13 As a result, the duration of host‐modulation therapy as an adjunct to scaling and root planing was increased in later clinical trials by various groups10, 50, 53, 58, 59 to regimens of 3, 6, and 9 months, and 1 and 2 years. This strategy provided solid evidence not only of prolonged clinical efficacy and safety, but also of substantivity, which is discussed below.",
        "After early discovery studies demonstrated that short‐term regimens of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline inhibited inflammatory/collagenolytic biomechanisms of periodontal disease in humans, and without the emergence of antibiotic‐resistant microorganisms,2 longer‐term studies were then carried out.8 As an example of the impressive scope of some of these studies, Ciancio and Ashley61 described a multicenter, placebo‐controlled double‐blind randomized clinical trial of 531 patients with chronic periodontitis to assess long‐term efficacy of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline. In brief, clinical improvements were seen, over a 12‐month time period, in pocket depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, alveolar bone height (assessed using subtraction radiography), and disease activity (defined as “incidences of rapid progression”).61 Moreover, the 1‐year administration of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline produced a safety profile of adverse events that was the same as for the placebo (there was also no effect on diagnostic laboratory parameters, including liver and kidney function), and no microbial resistance was developed to tetracyclines or other antibiotics in the patients treated with subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline.",
        "Subsequent clinical studies addressed the substantivity of host‐modulation therapy, namely the ability of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline to produce therapeutic benefits for months after the patient has stopped taking the medication, which are now discussed.",
        "Although Caton and Ryan10 reported that a 1‐month treatment with subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline was not sufficient to produce a long‐term benefit, a 3‐month regimen did produce prolonged improvement during the subsequent no‐treatment phase of the study. Consistent with these findings, a 1‐year double‐blind placebo‐controlled study of 190 participants with chronic periodontitis, which involved 5 dental centers, reported significant reductions in probing depth, gains in clinical attachment, and prevention of disease progression, over a 9‐month time period of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline therapy. These clinical benefits were maintained for at least 3 months after the treatment was stopped.",
        "This substantivity of clinical improvement was also seen in studies of patients with rapidly progressing severe periodontitis. In one such study, participants with severe disease were administered a 6‐month regimen of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline adjunctive to repeated scaling and root planing treatments. The dramatic improvement in clinical response, compared with repeated scaling and root planing plus placebo treatments, was maintained for at least 3 months after the cessation of host‐modulation therapy.14, 48, 62 In another study, a 3‐month regimen of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline adjunctive to nonsurgical therapy administered to smokers with severe periodontitis also produced significant substantivity.53 Moreover, a demonstration of prolonged substantivity was provided by Emingil et al.63 In this 1‐year placebo‐controlled double‐blind study, the patients with periodontitis were administered adjunctive subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline for only the first 3 months. Of note, the improved clinical measures (gingival index, probing depth, clinical attachment gain) and biomarker responses (gingival crevicular fluid levels of interleukin‐6, tumor necrosis factor‐alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1), compared with placebo administration, were maintained for at least 9 months after the cessation of medication.",
        "A more recent 2‐year randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled study of 128 postmenopausal women, a category of individuals at risk for progressive periodontal disease and bone loss, provides further evidence for the safety and efficacy of prolonged subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline therapy. These data are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.50, 51, 54, 64, 65, 66 As shown in Table 2, there was no evidence of adverse events in the postmenopausal women taking subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline, adjunctive to nonsurgical therapy, for the 2‐year study period compared with placebo.66 However, 1 category did show a significant effect, but it cannot be described as an adverse event; namely, the women who were administered subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline showed a highly significant (P = .002) 90% reduction in dermatologic adverse events. As discussed below, this observation supports the efficacy of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline in managing a variety of chronic inflammatory/collagenolytic diseases, such as (but not limited to) rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, as well as dermatologic diseases, including acne and rosacea. Regarding periodontitis in the postmenopausal women in the above study, the 2‐year regimen of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline produced significant improvements (compared with placebo administration) in clinical measures (pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and periodontal disease progression), radiographic bone loss (observed using subtraction radiography and computer‐assisted densitometric image analysis), and gingival crevicular fluid biomarkers (cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and ICTP; Table 3). Also of interest, particularly in this group of individuals who exhibited mild systemic (skeletal) bone loss diagnosed as osteopenia, the postmenopausal women who were administered subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline showed a significant reduction in ICTP in their systemic circulation, indicating that this host‐modulation therapy for their periodontal disease might also be reducing their risk for developing more severe systemic bone loss or osteoporosis.50, 64",
        "Additional evidence of efficacy, safety, and substantivity of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline, as adjunctive therapy following periodontal surgery, was provided by the Forsyth/Michigan group.9 In this 1‐year study, 24 patients with severe chronic periodontitis were administered subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline (Periostat®) or placebo capsules twice a day for the first 6 months after access flap surgery. The response to this host‐modulation therapy was assessed by clinical measures, gingival crevicular fluid bone‐resorption biomarkers (ICTP), and microbial DNA analysis of multiple bacterial species. The most profound clinical outcome of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline therapy compared with placebo was a significant reduction of pocket depth, a benefit that was still observed 6 months after discontinuing this host‐modulation therapy. The authors concluded that subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline promoted more rapid wound healing “by preventing collagen disruption and indirectly encouraging collagen formation,” interpretations consistent with earlier observations listed in Table 1 on the ability of nonantibiotic tetracyclines to upregulate collagen synthesis, osteoblast activity, and bone formation.",
        "In summary, numerous short‐ and long‐term clinical trials, over several decades of investigation, have demonstrated, without any contradictory evidence, that subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline (Periostat®), now generic in the USA, and more recently Oracea®, are safe and effective adjuncts in the management of chronic periodontitis and its more aggressive forms. Regarding these more aggressive forms of periodontitis147, subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline has also demonstrated efficacy in reducing periodontal disease severity in highly susceptible categories of patients, including institutionalized geriatric individuals,67 smokers,14, 53 patients with diabetes,68, 69 and cardiovascular patients.70, 71, 72 Later sections will address the therapeutic potential of chemically modified tetracyclines and of the dosage regimens of nonantibiotic tetracyclines in the management of several medical diseases, including the fields of ophthalmology, dermatology, cardiac and pulmonary disorders, diabetes, arthritis, and cancer.",
        "Soon after the development of nonantibiotic formulations or dosage regimens of doxycycline (20 mg twice a day) as safe and effective host‐modulator medications, a second strategy emerged involving the chemical modification of the tetracycline (or doxycycline or minocycline) molecule to eliminate its antibacterial activity selectively, but to retain or even enhance its matrix metalloproteinase‐inhibitory (host‐modulating) properties. As first described by Golub et al,2, 147 this involved the removal of a side‐chain on the tetracycline molecule, the dimethylamino group at carbon‐4 of the A ring, which is responsible for the drug's antibiotic activity, and the preservation of the zinc‐ and calcium‐binding site (the beta‐diketone moiety) at carbon‐11 and carbon‐12, which we identified as the site on the tetracycline molecule responsible for its matrix metalloproteinase‐inhibitory activity. The elimination of this metal ion‐binding site, by chemically converting the tetracycline molecule to its pyrazole analog, eliminated the drug's matrix metalloproteinase‐inhibitory properties.2 As a result of these, and additional chemical modifications, a series of nonantibacterial matrix metalloproteinase‐inhibitory tetracyclines was developed. One of these, chemically modified tetracycline‐3, was found, based on in vitro and animal studies, to be a potent matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor with significant therapeutic potential.24 In vitro, chemically modified tetracycline‐3 was found to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase expression and activity in human colon and breast cancer cells, in addition to cytostatic effects on human renal and prostate cancer. In vivo administration of this novel compound to rats with prostate cancer inhibited tumor growth and metastasis.2, 73, 74, 75, 76 As a result of these and other studies, the National Cancer Institute (National Institutes of Health) in collaboration with Dezube et al 26 (Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, Harvard Medical School) tested chemically modified tetracycline‐3 in phase I and phase II clinical trials. In phase I trials, the maximum tolerable dose was determined to be 150 mg/d. When administered orally, the compound was found to be rapidly absorbed, producing a peak blood level of 2‐5 μg/mL, with a prolonged serum half‐life of approximately 40 hours.75, 77, 78 In this study, chemically modified tetracycline‐3 (CMT‐3, or COL‐3) was administered once a day to patients with AIDS‐related Kaposi sarcoma, who exhibited a 44% response rate, reflecting a decrease of angiogenic lesions, which was associated with a suppression of matrix metalloproteinase‐2 levels in the circulation. In a larger phase II clinical trial, a group of patients with Kaposi sarcoma, who received a daily oral dose of 50 mg of chemically modified tetracycline‐3, showed a significant reduction of angiogenic lesions, whereas the individuals who were administered the higher dose (100 mg once a day) did not. One explanation is that the increased side effects of the higher dose resulted in decreased patient compliance. Significant reductions in plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase‐2 and matrix metalloproteinase‐9 were observed, and the most common adverse events were photosensitivity and rash, which could be quite severe.26, 75",
        "The same compound was found to reduce mortality in a pig and other animal models of an often‐fatal lung disorder, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and showed evidence of efficacy in models of septic shock.79, 80, 81, 82 The only human study testing chemically modified tetracycline‐3 on periodontal disease was a pilot trial, conducted by Ryan et al.25 A low dose of chemically modified tetracycline‐3 (10 mg/d) was administered to patients with chronic periodontitis and showed modest evidence of efficacy in reducing interleukin‐1beta and matrix metalloproteinase‐8 in gingival crevicular fluid samples, with no evidence of the severe side effect of photosensitivity previously seen in the extensive studies of Kaposi sarcoma patients using higher doses of chemically modified tetracycline‐3. As described below, newer chemically modified polyphenolic compounds derived from a common food supplement, curcumin, are being developed by the Stony Brook group. These compounds are potent inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases and reduce the levels of inflammatory mediators. They appear to be much safer than chemically modified tetracycline‐3, although clinical trials on humans have not yet been carried out.",
        "Because collagen is the major structural protein in connective tissues, including (but not limited to) skin, bone, tendon, ligaments, cornea of the eye, cartilage of the joints, etc., and because the only host‐derived neutral proteinases able to degrade the triple‐helical collagen molecule under physiologic conditions of pH (7.4‐7.6) and body temperature are the collagenolytic matrix metalloproteinases (essentially the three collagenases matrix metalloproteinase‐1, matrix metalloproteinase‐8, and matrix metalloproteinase‐13, and, to a lesser extent, matrix metalloproteinase‐2 and matrix metalloproteinase‐14), it is not surprising that any new medication that can inhibit these matrix metalloproteinases would be expected to have widespread medical as well as dental applications. In this regard, two special issues of the journal, Pharmacological Research, had “Clinical Applications of Non‐antibacterial Tetracyclines” as their theme and most chapters focused on medical disorders including cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, dermatology, ophthalmology, rheumatology, and cancer, with extensive detail on each disease.33, 34",
        "Soon after the discovery of tetracyclines as matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, one of the first medical applications was for noninfected or sterile corneal ulcers.83 Perry reported that a patient with a sterile corneal ulcer, refractory to standard treatment, responded dramatically within 48 hours after initiating tetracycline therapy, with no recurrence long term (see Figure 1). In a follow‐up case series involving 18 patients with persistent sterile corneal defects, most patients had healed lesions within 48 hours after initiating oral tetracycline therapy and all lesions were resolved within 2 weeks.84 Given that various cell types in the cornea, including the epithelium, fibroblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils, produce a variety of matrix metalloproteinases (matrix metalloproteinase‐1, ‐8, ‐2, ‐9), the response to tetracycline host‐modulatory therapy, although profound, was not surprising.85 Subsequently, both topical and systemic tetracycline therapies were effective in rabbit models of sterile corneal ulcers86 and all three tetracyclines, including minocycline and doxycycline, were effective inhibitors of corneal collagenases.87 Federici88 reviewed a number of studies using tetracyclines for sterile corneal ulcers, chemical burns of the eye, and blepharitis of the eyelid, and concluded that these (and other ophthalmic diseases, such as cataract, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy) may benefit from the nonantibiotic properties of tetracyclines and other novel matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors.",
        "The clinical response of a patient with a sterile corneal ulcer refractory to standard ophthalmological treatment. A, Note the “moon crater” painful ulcer associated with severe inflammation of the sclera. B, Significant healing of the sterile corneal ulcer and reduction of inflammation 48 hours after initiating doxycycline anticollagenase therapy. C, Complete healing after 1 month of doxycycline administration (reproduced with permission from Henry Perry, MD)",
        "Early reports on tetracycline's efficacy in serious dermatologic lesions, soon after their matrix metalloproteinase‐inhibitory properties were discovered,1, 2 focused on the hope that this safe collagenase inhibitor would be useful in a rare, and often fatal, skin disease, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. In this regard, White89 described two cases of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa in which minocycline therapy substantially reduced dermal blisters and ulcers. The rationale for this therapy was the demonstration, in patients with epidermolysis bullosa, of excessive collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase‐1) and other matrix metalloproteinases (matrix metalloproteinase‐3), which could accelerate degradation of type VII collagen anchoring the dermis to the type IV collagen of the epidermal basement membrane.90, 91 However, in a more recent review, Monk et al49 did not find sufficient evidence to support treatment of epidermolysis bullosa with tetracyclines. The same authors, however, did conclude that tetracyclines, by their nonantibiotic properties, were efficacious in a more common skin blistering disorder, bullous pemphigoid. The mechanism proposed involved tetracycline's inhibition of various matrix metalloproteinases (matrix metalloproteinase‐2, matrix metalloproteinase‐9, matrix metalloproteinase‐13), which mediate the degradation of a basement membrane constituent, type XVII collagen. Another dermatologic application was described by Humbert et al.90 They found that doxycycline treatment completely healed the sterile, deep, painful skin ulcers in patients with alpha1‐antitrypsin‐deficiency panniculitis. This disorder affects a significant number of northern Europeans characterized by a genetic deficiency of this endogenous proteinase inhibitor, which can also be degraded by matrix metalloproteinases. Thus, doxycycline, by directly inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (including their ability to degrade the serum protein, alpha1‐antitrypsin) enables even any remaining low levels of this endogenous serine proteinase inhibitor in these patients to continue preventing the breakdown of dermal connective tissue constituents.",
        "Finally, Cohn et al92 reported that patients with benign mucus membrane pemphigoid showed a reduction of oral mucosal blisters and ulcers after a 3‐month regimen of nonantibiotic doxycycline. In this oral disease, nonantibiotic doxycycline inhibited accelerated degradation of the hemidesmosomal protein, type XVII collagen, by matrix metalloproteinase‐9, thus preventing blister formation. Anecdotal observations indicated enhanced efficacy when this regimen was combined with a nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug, consistent with similar observations in rheumatology (discussed below).",
        "However, the most immediate medical impact of nonantibiotic doxycycline has been on the common skin disorders, acne and rosacea. As described earlier in this chapter, a major clinical trial on postmenopausal women that focused on the long‐term response of periodontal and systemic (osteopenia) bone loss to nonantimicrobial doxycycline resulted in a 90% (P = .002) reduction in dermatologic adverse events (eg, acne, rash) compared with the incidence of adverse events in individuals given a placebo (Table 2).",
        "As summarized by Monk et al,49 rosacea is characterized by erythema patches in the facial skin, as well as other inflammatory lesions, including pustules and papules, and swollen veins (telangiectasia) in the nose and cheeks. The repeated success of subantimicrobial‐ or nonantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline, either in a novel sustained‐release formulation of 40 mg once per day (ie., Oracea®) (note: 40 or 50 mg doxycycline, as standard formulations, do produce antibiotic blood levels and side effects) or as now‐generic, 20 mg twice a day (Periostat®), \"provides the most abundant clinical evidence, to date, that tetracyclines are effective through their nonantimicrobial actions.\"49 The efficacy of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline in these patients has been ascribed to multiple mechanisms of action, including decreased cytokine production, reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase activity, reactive oxygen species inhibition, antiangiogenesis, and collagen preservation as a result of both matrix metalloproteinase inhibition and enhanced collagen production.49 The literature supporting the safety and efficacy of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline in this dermatologic disorder is substantial. Among the most extensive published clinical studies, Del Rosso et al93 carried out 2 multicenter, 4‐month phase III clinical trials of 537 adults and found significant improvements in numbers of inflammatory skin lesions (papules, pustules, nodules) and decreased erythema. In a subsequent study, the same investigators94 found that although nonantibiotic doxycycline was as efficacious as higher (100 mg) antibiotic‐dose doxycycline, the lower dose produced significantly fewer adverse events. Subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline was also found to be significantly more effective in treating rosacea, even when combined with topical metronidazole.95 As with rosacea, acne has also responded significantly to subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline in randomized clinical trials, with reductions in inflammatory skin lesions, including papules, pustules, and comedones. Nonantibacterial mechanisms of action of doxycycline and other tetracyclines have been ascribed to the inhibition of interleukin‐8, lipoxygenase, matrix metalloproteinase‐1, and reactive oxygen species, as well as altered neutrophil chemotaxis and activation.49, 96, 97",
        "As reviewed by Greenwald,57 early studies on the scientific basis for tetracycline treatment of arthritic disorders were focused on the drug's antibiotic properties and, later, on its anti‐inflammatory efficacy, the latter characterized by reduced leukocyte chemotactic and phagocytic activity. Then, in a seminal paper, Greenwald et al56 described data on a cohort of patients with arthritis who required bilateral total knee replacements. In each of 6 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the synovial tissue from one knee was harvested, with the tissue from the other knee being harvested 2 weeks later. Minocycline or placebo capsules were administered orally on a daily basis during the interval. When the tissues were extracted, partially purified, and analyzed in a blinded protocol, the inflamed synovial tissues of the patients treated with minocycline showed a 67% reduction in matrix metalloproteinase/collagenase activity compared with the tissues of patients given a placebo. Smith et al98 followed a similar protocol in patients with osteoarthritis, with similar results obtained using doxycycline.98 Israel et al,99 in a dentally relevant case study, described clinical and radiologic evidence of improvement in osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint. Perhaps the most compelling evidence of tetracycline's host‐modulatory efficacy in arthritis was the long‐term clinical trial by O'Dell et al.52 Sixty‐six patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, based on clinical, radiographic, and biomarker (rheumatoid factor‐positive) criteria, were administered subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline (20 mg), 100 mg of doxycycline, or placebo capsules over a 2‐year period. All patients received standard‐of‐care methotrexate, in addition to the test medications. Both groups that were given doxycycline exhibited a similar 2‐ to 3‐fold improvement in rheumatoid arthritis scores (eg, joint pain, number of swollen joints, grip strength, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, etc.) compared with the control subjects, and the subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline group experienced the same incidence of adverse events as the group that were given a placebo. By contrast, the individuals given higher antibiotic‐dose doxycycline showed more adverse events over the 2‐year protocol.",
        "Animal studies (rats, dogs) on experimentally induced rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis also provide further evidence of the efficacy of nonantibiotic tetracyclines as host modulators. In some of these studies, a chemically modified tetracycline (eg, chemically modified tetracycline‐1; 4‐dedimethylamino tetracycline) was tested and, when combined with a nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (such as indomethacin, flurbiprofen), a synergistic therapeutic response was observed.100, 101 Subsequent studies demonstrated that the administration of doxycycline in human osteoarthritis produced these benefits in association with suppression of the matrix metalloproteinases, collagenase and gelatinase.98",
        "The research and development of nonantibiotic tetracyclines as host modulators continues to expand into additional medical conditions. However, because these initial studies and biologic mechanisms have been reviewed extensively,13, 33, 34 and because the results of longer‐term randomized clinical trials that demonstrate the efficacy of host‐modulation therapies on diseases such as cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disorders, etc., have yet to be reported, these topics will only be briefly discussed.",
        "Regarding cardiovascular disease, animal studies have shown reductions in the severity of hypertension and aortic aneurysm expansion, ascribed in part to inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase‐9 and matrix metalloproteinase‐12 by chemically modified tetracycline and doxycycline, which preserves collagen and elastic fibers in blood vessel walls.72, 102, 103 Regarding atherosclerosis, the analysis of thousands of records by Meier et al104 identified a reduced risk for acute myocardial infarction in those patients who had been treated for infection with a tetracycline over a 5‐year period. By contrast, no effect was seen in those patients treated with a different antibiotic (erythromycin, penicillin, cephalosporin). Initially, the antibiotic superiority of tetracyclines to suppress Chlamydia pneumoniae (previously, but not currently, associated with cardiovascular disease) was speculated. However, Golub et al71 proposed that tetracycline's unique ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase‐mediated rupture of the collagen‐coated atheromatous plaque lining coronary arteries was the mechanism. A study showing evidence of the efficacy of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline in patients with acute coronary syndromes70 provides support for this hypothesis.",
        "Several short‐term (1 and 6 months) double‐blind placebo‐controlled studies of patients with cardiovascular disease have shown promising responses on biomarkers of systemic inflammation and collagenolysis. Brown et al70 reported that patients with acute coronary syndrome who were administered Periostat® for 6 months showed significant reductions in high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein, interleukin‐6, and matrix metalloproteinase‐9 in their plasma. In addition, elevations in cardioprotective high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (and its core molecule, ApoA1 lipoprotein) were also seen in patients exhibiting both cardiovascular disease and periodontitis who were treated with scaling and root planing and adjunctive Periostat®.105, 106",
        "Similar beneficial cardiovascular disease biomarker responses in a long‐term (2‐year) Periostat® study were confirmed in a major National Institutes of Health‐supported randomized placebo‐controlled clinical trial of 128 postmenopausal women, a patient cohort at risk for cardiovascular disease.51, 65 Schulz107 provided a novel mechanism for the observations described above, which involved the previously unrecognized ability of tetracyclines to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase degradation of intracellular contractile proteins (actin, myosin, troponin) in the cytoplasm of cardiac myocytes.",
        "In pulmonary disease, the most dramatic life‐saving response to the host‐modulating properties of nonantibiotic doxycycline was that described by Moses et al108 in a patient with lymphangioleiomeiomatosis. Her case report in the New England Journal of Medicine was soon followed‐up with similar positive results in 30 patients in Brazil.109 In brief, this rare and fatal lung disease is characterized by the progressive loss of lung function mediated by uncontrolled invasion of lung tissue by neoplastic smooth muscle cells, which express excessive levels of matrix metalloproteinases, especially the collagen and elastic fiber‐degrading gelatinases/type IV collagenases, matrix metalloproteinase‐2 and matrix metalloproteinase‐9. Treatment was initiated with subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline (20 mg once a day, then 20 mg twice a day), which began to reduce symptoms and biomarkers. The dose was then increased to 100 mg, with significant clinical improvement. The result was an improved quality of life and the cancellation of lung transplant surgery. Another pulmonary disease that has responded, at least in animal models, including a clinically applicable porcine model, is acute respiratory distress syndrome.82 In this, and other studies, a potent matrix metalloproteinase‐inhibitor, nonantimicrobial chemically modified tetracycline‐3, reduced signs and symptoms, including fatal outcomes.81, 82",
        "The impact of nonantibiotic tetracycline host modulators (chemically modified tetracyclines and subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline) on two major medical conditions, namely diabetes and postmenopausal bone loss (oral and skeletal), has been summarized in several articles, including a recent review by our group.24",
        "Historically, the concept of host‐modulation therapy originated from early experiments by our group targeting the impact of type 1 diabetes on periodontal inflammation, collagen turnover, and bone loss.2, 4, 5, 6 The breakthrough occurred when tetracycline therapy was found to modulate the host response effectively even in germ‐free rats with diabetes. Subsequent studies by Ryan et al68 found similar periodontal and systemic biologic changes in rats with type 2 diabetes treated with host‐modulating tetracyclines. One long‐held controversy in this field involved the reported efficacy of nonsurgical periodontal therapy (scaling and root planing combined with oral hygiene instruction and antiseptic mouthrinses) in reducing hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.110, 111 As recently reviewed,24 this was subsequently challenged in a multi‐institutional clinical trial by Engebretson et al,112 who did not find any significant improvement in glycated hemoglobin levels as a result of nonsurgical periodontal therapy. The same author reported that although scaling and root planing alone, or combined with adjunctive antibiotic therapy, did not significantly reduce glycated hemoglobin levels, when a 3‐month regimen of host‐modulation therapy (nonantibiotic doxycycline, 20 mg twice a day) was added to the scaling and root planing treatment protocol, the level of glycated hemoglobin was reduced.58 Clearly this important topic in dentistry and medicine needs further investigation to confirm whether subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline, with prolonged administration, can significantly reduce hyperglycemia; and whether host‐modulating periodontal therapy should be incorporated into the management protocol for diabetes, which is an increasingly prevalent and devastating disease worldwide.",
        "The final topic to be discussed, before addressing newer host‐modulation therapies being developed (see Section 6), is the local and systemic benefits of subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline in postmenopausal women with periodontitis (local bone loss) and skeletal (systemic) osteopenia.51 The substantial basic science foundation for launching this major National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research National Institutes of Health‐supported and ‐monitored long‐term study included the following early observations: tetracyclines, by nonantibacterial mechanisms, were found to inhibit, directly, excessive bone resorption in organ culture,113 osteoclast activity in cell culture,114 and alveolar bone loss in experimental periodontitis.1, 2, 116 The biologic rationale for these studies included the following: type 1 collagen constitutes 90% of the organic matrix of bone, and matrix metalloproteinases (notably the collagenases and gelatinases, and others, such as membrane type 1‐matrix metalloproteinase/matrix metalloproteinase‐14) produced by bone cells (osteoclasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes) mediate collagenolysis during bone resorption. Thus, the matrix metalloproteinase‐inhibitory properties of tetracyclines and their chemically modified nonantimicrobial analogs (the chemically modified tetracyclines) could be expected to downregulate bone resorption. Unexpectedly, however, these host‐modulatory agents were also found to upregulate bone formation. Evidence for this pro‐anabolic tetracycline effect included host‐modulation therapy‐enhanced expression of type 1 procollagen mRNA, together with increased collagen synthesis and bone formation, all of which were suppressed in rats with diabetes.114, 116, 117, 118 Another compelling rationale for testing subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline in a randomized clinical trial of postmenopausal women was an early study by Golub et al.119 Using the standard animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis, the ovariectomized rat, the investigators found that the oral administration of chemically modified nonantibiotic doxycycline (chemically modified tetracycline‐8) inhibited gingival matrix metalloproteinase activity and periodontal breakdown, while also reducing the severity of skeletal osteoporosis. Consistent with these observations, Scarpellini et al120 reported that doxycycline administered to postmenopausal women “normalized” biomarkers of bone formation (osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase) and bone resorption (urinary excretion of hydroxyproline).",
        "A preliminary 1‐year clinical trial was then carried out on postmenopausal women who were diagnosed with both local (periodontitis) and systemic (osteopenia/osteoporosis) bone loss. Subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline, compared with treatment with placebo capsules, as an adjunct to periodontal maintenance therapy, reduced alveolar bone loss and suppressed the progressive loss of clinical attachment.50 The totality of the in vitro, animal, and preliminary clinical study just described, led to a major bi‐institutional (University of Nebraska and Stony Brook University) double‐blind clinical trial on 128 postmenopausal women administered subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline or placebo capsules for 2 years adjunctive to periodontal maintenance therapy every 3‐4 months. These data were published in a variety of dental, medical, and biology journals, and were summarized by Payne and Golub.51 In brief, the 2‐year regimen of host‐modulation therapy did not produce adverse events, only benefits, (ie, the women on Periostat showed a 90% [P = .002] reduction in dermatologic adverse events, which included acne, rosacea, and rash) (Table 2). Regarding examples of efficacy in this extensive study, a 36% lower odds of progressive alveolar bone loss was found in women within 5 years of menopause, for those who were protocol‐adherent, compared with those administered placebo (P = .03), plus significant reductions in both clinical attachment loss and active pockets. The postmenopausal women on subantimicrobial‐dose doxycycline also showed significant reductions in collagenase, predominantly matrix metalloproteinase‐8, in gingival crevicular fluid, as well as significant reductions in bone collagen degradation fragments (ICTP) in periodontal pockets (Table 3). A similar response of ICTP and a newer biomarker of bone collagen degradation (carboxy‐terminal collagen crosslinks) in serum samples led to the conclusion that this host‐modulation therapy reduced the risk of mild systemic bone loss, osteopenia, progressing into the more severe form of skeletal deficiency, osteoporosis.64",
        "Although the discovery of the unexpected property of tetracyclines as matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors has been translated into novel first‐generation (Periostat®, Oracea®) and second‐generation (chemically modified tetracycline‐3) pharmaceutical agents, a third generation of related host‐modulating therapeutics is now being developed (Figure 2). Based on our previous identification of the matrix metalloproteinase‐inhibiting active site on the 4‐phenolic‐ring tetracyclines,1, 2, 24, 147 we began to focus on diphenolic compounds with the same cation (Zn++, Ca++)‐binding site, the beta‐diketone moiety. These included the bis‐aroyl methanes and curcumin. The bis‐aroyl methane compounds exhibited positive, but weak, matrix metalloproteinase‐inhibitory efficacy in vitro, namely high IC50 (μm) values, and were quickly abandoned.30, 31 Curcumin, a dietary herbal ingredient derived from turmeric, has historically been advocated as a safe and effective treatment for a variety of diseases.30, 31, 32 However, it has long been known that this compound's insolubility and poor absorption by the oral route has limited its clinical application.123, 124, 125",
        "The development scheme of first‐generation (1a, nonantibiotic doxycycline formulations), second‐generation (1b, nonantibiotic chemically modified tetracycline‐3 [CMT‐3]), and third‐generation (3a, b, chemically modified curcumins [CMCs]) host‐modulating therapeutics. This strategy was based on these tetra‐, tri‐, and diphenolic compounds all exhibiting the Zn++‐binding beta‐diketone (1a, 1b, 2) or triketone (3a, 3b) moieties in the structures illustrated30, 31",
        "Recently, our Stony Brook University laboratories (Oral Biology and Chemistry departments, Dr. Francis Johnson) have synthesized, developed, and tested a series of novel chemically modified curcumins with various side chains added to the carbon‐4 position of this biphenolic compound (Figure 2). Based on these studies, a lead triphenolic compound, a triketonic phenylaminocarbonyl curcumin‐2.24, was identified, which has been tested in vitro, in cell and tissue culture, and in vivo using various animal species, including mice, rats, rabbits, and, most recently, dogs.",
        "Based on their in vitro efficacy as inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase‐mediated degradation of a fluorogenic synthetic peptide substrate with the susceptible glycine‐leucine peptide bond, the original series of 16 different chemically modified curcumins, all with a carbon‐4 substituent, was reduced to several promising novel triketonic compounds. Two of these, chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 (4‐phenylaminocarbonyl curcumin) and chemically modified curcumin‐2.5 (4‐methoxycarbonyl curcumin), were then compared with diketonic natural curcumin to determine their potency as matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors. Chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 was found to bind most strongly to Zn++ and to serum albumin, consistent with its enhanced potential to function in vivo (discussed below) as a potent inhibitor of Zn++‐dependent collagenases, and to retard decomposition of the serum albumin‐bound chemically modified curcumin, thus enhancing its bioavailability.30, 31 Preliminary cell culture studies on human monocytes stimulated with microbial lipopolysaccharide/endotoxin demonstrated that chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 was superior to chemically modified curcumin‐2.5 as an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase‐9 (92 kDa gelatinase). A similar result was seen in macrophages derived from rats with diabetes that were orally administered the same compounds.30, 31 Therefore, although chemically modified curcumin‐2.5 was superior to the parent compound curcumin as a matrix metalloproteinase‐9 and a matrix metalloproteinase‐13 (collagenase‐3) inhibitor in vitro, with similar effects in vivo, it has since been abandoned in favor of chemically modified curcumin‐2.24. Like chemically modified curcumin‐2.5, curcumin‐2.24 was also more effective than curcumin in suppressing the inflammatory mediators interleukin‐1beta, interleukin‐6, prostaglandin E2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1, as well as matrix metalloproteinase‐9 secretion, by human monocytes in culture. The effects of chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 were recently associated with decreased activation/phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells, which regulates transcription of a number of gene products associated with inflammatory diseases.29",
        "In addition to chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 exhibiting superior efficacy compared to curcumin or chemically modified curcumin‐2.5 as an inhibitor of inflammatory mediators and matrix metalloproteinases, this novel compound was found to be even more effective in reducing alveolar bone loss in vivo. In this regard, Guimarães et al126 reported that although curcumin was effective in suppressing inflammatory mediators in the rat model of lipopolysaccharide‐induced periodontal disease, natural curcumin had no effect on alveolar bone loss, an observation that was later confirmed.127 They also found that natural curcumin and chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 reduce the severity of inflammation in experimental periodontal disease by different mechanisms, and only the latter decreased the number of osteoclasts characterized immunohistochemically as tartrate‐resistant acid phosphatase‐positive (TRAP‐positive) and caspase‐3‐positive cells. Elburki et al,27, 28 in a preliminary study (later confirmed; see below) using the same rat model of periodontitis, found that pathologic alveolar bone loss was completely prevented by orally administered chemically modified curcumin‐2.24. This dramatic effect on periodontal bone loss in vivo was associated with suppression of the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin‐1beta, and reduced levels of pro and activated forms of leukocyte‐type gelatinase (matrix metalloproteinase‐9) in the gingival tissues. Moreover, this locally induced periodontitis, and its treatment with chemically modified curcumin‐2.24, exhibited systemic manifestations ie, the elevated levels in the circulation of interleukin‐1beta and the activated form of matrix metalloproteinase‐8 [leukocyte‐type collagenase] in the circulation of rats with experimental periodontitis were both significantly reduced by oral administration of chemically modified curcumin.",
        "To explore further the potential of our lead compound as a host modulator, chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 was orally administered to 2 different animal models of severe periodontal breakdown 27, 28, 29. In both the locally (microbial endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide) and the systemically (diabetes)‐induced rat models of disease, chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 treatment resulted in a marked reduction of inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in the gingival tissues, decreased bone loss, and decreased activation of p65 nuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells and p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase pathways.29 These data further supported the potent ability of this chemically modified curcumin to modulate intra‐ and extracellular mechanisms that are associated, at least in part, with the zinc‐binding characteristics of this and related compounds.29 This pattern of efficacy is also consistent with the pleiotropic characteristics of the zinc‐binding nonantimicrobial tetracyclines.2, 24",
        "The potency of chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 therapy has also been demonstrated in a challenging, but clinically relevant, dental/medical situation using an animal model that mimics a patient with poorly controlled diabetes and severe periodontitis. Once again, chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 did not reduce the severe hyperglycemia (at least during the 1‐month experimental protocol), yet completely prevented alveolar bone loss, which was induced by multiple lipopolysaccharide injections into the gingiva of rats with severe diabetes.29 Addressing the causality of this decreased periodontal breakdown, this novel therapeutic also suppressed the excessive levels of pro‐ and activated matrix metalloproteinase‐2 and matrix metalloproteinase‐9 (gelatinases/type IV collagenases) in the diseased gingival tissues, as well as the activated (lower molecular weight) form of the dominant collagenase, matrix metalloproteinase‐8, in these oral tissues. The dominant cytokines in the inflamed gingiva, interleukin‐1beta and interleukin‐6 (tumor necrosis factor‐alpha was not detected), were also reduced locally by this treatment, and similar beneficial biomarker changes were seen systemically in the circulation, as well as in skin. Collagen atrophy and excessive collagen crosslinking (ie, “leather‐like” texture) were also normalized in the animals with diabetes that were treated with chemically modified curcumin‐2.24. This is of particular relevance to a common medical complication in patients with diabetes ie, impaired healing of wounds in skin, gingiva, and other tissues 32.",
        "The clinical complications (adverse events) associated with the severely hyperglycemic state in this rat model of type 1 diabetes, which included bleeding under the nails, inflammation of the sclera, and impaired wound healing, were also prevented by this treatment.28, 29 It should be noted that impaired wound healing in skin, especially in the lower extremities, can be a life‐threatening complication in patients with diabetes and is a major cause of limb amputation in humans.128, 129 This important complication and other serious medical disorders, and their response to chemically modified curcumin‐2.24, are also discussed in the next section.",
        "The novel host‐modulation therapy highlighted in this review was recently found to be exceptionally effective in normalizing, not just improving, the healing of skin wounds categorized as standard and severe in rats with type 1 diabetes.32 Of particular interest, the therapeutic response occurred even in the presence of severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose levels of 500 mg/dL) and was equally effective when applied either topically or systemically. A 1% suspension of chemically modified curcumin‐2.24, applied topically, produced optimal results (assessed using clinical, biochemical and histomorphometric measurements) based on a significant reduction of pathologically excessive matrix metalloproteinase‐8 (collagenase‐2) and hydroxyproline levels in wound tissue. An additional mechanism currently being investigated is the ability of chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 to normalize a key resolvin (RvD1; a docosahexanoic acid derivative) and interleukin‐10 (an anti‐inflammatory cytokine), which are both underexpressed in macrophages isolated from severely hyperglycemic rats with diabetes.130, 131",
        "A recent study by Wang et al122 demonstrated that chemically modified curcumin‐2.24, administered by oral gavage, was more effective than natural curcumin in reducing lung injury in a standard mouse model of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In brief, Staphylococcus aureus administered by intratracheal inoculation was used to create the lung disease. Based on analysis of bronchioalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue, chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 significantly reduced lung tissue apoptosis. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, alveolar neutrophils and macrophages, the matrix metalloproteinases, matrix metalloproteinase‐2, matrix metalloproteinase‐9 (gelatinases, type IV collagenases), matrix metalloproteinase‐12 (macrophage metallo‐elastase), and nuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells 65 were all significantly reduced. The authors concluded that, in this model, chemically modified curcumin has the potential to attenuate lung injury and reduce mortality.",
        "In contrast to the tetracycline‐based host modulators that have been studied extensively in human and experimental rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, the chemically modified curcumins are just beginning to receive attention. In this regard, Katzap et al132 compared the efficacy of several of these novel compounds, including chemically modified curcumin‐2.14, ‐2.5 and ‐2.23, and our lead compound, chemically modified curcumin‐2.24, with natural curcumin, in a standard tissue culture model of arthritis. Bovine cartilage explants, labeled with S35‐sulfate, were incubated with interleukin‐1beta and oncostatin to induce cartilage breakdown. Chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 was the compound most effective in reducing chondrolysis. In vivo studies using the rabbit model of arthritis are currently underway to confirm the therapeutic potential of this compound.",
        "Taking into account the previous studies described in this paper on the chemically modified tetracyclines in humans and animals with various cancers, and the similar cation‐binding site of curcumin and these nonantibacterial tetracycline compounds, several studies using chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 are now discussed. As a new generation taxol, SBT‐1214, was found to downregulate the expression of multiple genes in cancer stem cells in culture, and as natural curcumin was found to enhance the cytotoxic effects of a number of anticancer drugs, Botchkina et al133 tested this taxoid in combination with the novel curcuminoid, chemically modified curcumin‐2.24. They found that this treatment was more effective than SBT‐1214 alone in upregulating proapoptotic genes and suppressing multiple transcription factors in prostate cancer stem cells. As stated by the authors, this experimental therapeutic regimen has “high potential as a novel anti‐cancer drug combination.”133 Moreover, the potent characteristics of chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 as an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases is consistent with these host‐derived proteinases functioning as stromal effectors of carcinoma progression.134",
        "As this application of chemically modified curcumin in cancer treatment continues to emerge, several recent studies support this novel therapeutic approach. Wright et al121 reported that in a mouse model of medulloblastoma, treatment with chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 combined with a curcumin‐phosphatidyl choline (to improve bioavailability) showed therapeutic efficacy in controlling tumor growth. Of particular interest, Mackenzie's group at Stony Brook's Cancer Center recently demonstrated that chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells and reduced pancreatic tumor growth by inhibiting active Ras and signal transducer and activator of transcription‐3 phosphorylation.135 Moreover, even at high (1000 mg/kg) oral doses, the animals treated with chemically modified curcumin‐2.24 showed no evidence of toxicity (Heta Bhatt et al., unpublished data).",
        "Several additional host modulators have also demonstrated potential therapeutic value based on in vitro studies and animal studies but have not yet reached the stage of development to justify randomized clinical trials. Further studies on animal models of periodontal disease are also required. These compounds include the sirtuins and resveratrol.",
        "As reviewed recently by Mendes et al,136 the subset of sirtuins that are of particular relevance to periodontal disease include 7 proteins (sirtuins 1‐7) with different subcellular locations, mitochondria, cytoplasm, or nucleus. However, because of their deacylation activity, the nuclear sirtuins (sirtuins 1, 2, 6, and 7) in particular have been the focus of efficacy studies in several inflammatory diseases. One example of this strategy includes sirtuin 1, which suppresses nuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells activity, thus decreasing the expression of inflammatory mediators, cyclooxygenase‐2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and the cytokines, interleukin‐1beta, tumor necrosis factor‐alpha, interleukin‐6, and interleukin‐8.137",
        "Resveratrol, the phytochemical component of red wine often credited for its multiple health benefits, activates sirtuin 1138 and increases brown adipose tissue as part of complex cellular processes associated with aging, apoptosis, and inflammation.139 sirtuin 1 and other sirtuins can be inhibited by Zn++‐binding agents, such as the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, hydroxamic acid, suggesting additional mechanisms and therapeutic medications already highlighted in this review, including the nonantibiotic tetracyclines and curcuminoids. Although clinical trials testing these futuristic host modulators, (eg, resveratrol) for various diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, psoriasis, and colitis, are ongoing, their potential role in periodontitis has only been addressed in a relatively small number of animal studies. However, a recent study by Ikeda et al,140 using a mouse model of ligature‐induced periodontitis, provides grounds for optimism. Using techniques of morphometry/microcomputed tomography to quantify alveolar bone loss 3‐dimensionally, quantitative reverse transcriptase‐PCR to assess gene expression of gingival tissue cytokines (interleukin‐1beta, interleukin‐6), as well as quantifying tartrase‐resistant acid phosphatase‐positive osteoclasts in cell culture, the authors found that a natural source of resveratrol inhibited periodontal breakdown associated with decreased oxidative stress and reduced osteoclast differentiation and activity. Regarding resveratrol's therapeutic potential, significant issues remain, including poor bioavailability associated, in part, with rapid urinary excretion.141",
        "With the increasing recognition of the overarching importance of the host's inflammatory/collagenolytic responses as the \"driver\" of tissue breakdown during periodontitis, new treatment paradigms are emerging. Accordingly, this chapter has highlighted the 2 most‐developed host‐modulation therapy strategies to date. However, the specialty of periodontics has increasingly incorporated the placement of dental implants in its treatment strategies. This reflects, at least in part, its (and the public's) recognition of the significant enhancement of the dentition's function and esthetics by this technology.",
        "However, a surprisingly high incidence of peri‐implant mucositis and peri‐implantitis (19%‐65%) has been recognized as a significant complication, but with very limited treatment options (see the editorial by Giannobile and Lang142). Considering the well‐established negative impact of periodontitis around natural teeth, on systemic inflammation and health (eg, increased risk for cardiovascular disease), similar adverse systemic effects may also occur with peri‐implant diseases. This chapter has highlighted the safety and efficacy of government‐approved host‐modulation therapies for periodontal disease and their systemic benefits. There is now a compelling rationale for future studies: (1) that define the impact, if any, of peri‐implant disease on systemic inflammation; and (2) that assess the efficacy of host‐modulation therapies both locally (on inflamed peri‐implant tissues) and systemically (on circulating biomarkers of \"inflammatory/collagenolytic\" diseases) as adjuncts to conventional local disinfection treatments. These proposals are also driven by several studies that have addressed new diagnostic concepts. In this regard, Xu et al143 demonstrated a higher level of leukocyte‐type collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase‐8) in peri‐implantitis sulcular fluid than that seen in gingival crevicular fluid from patients with periodontitis. Moreover, based on numerous clinical studies (as recently reviewed by Alassiri et al144 and Al‐Majid et al145), Sorsa et al 144, 145have translated into clinical practice a novel chairside diagnostic test that detects pathologically elevated levels of activated matrix metalloproteinase‐8 in both gingival crevicular fluid and peri‐implantitis sulcular fluid. In closing, these novel diagnostic and therapeutic developments provide a \"window\" into future clinical applications of the basic and translational research described in this review.",

Despite successful therapies including antibodies against tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, only 20 to 30% of patients experience remission. We studied whether inhibiting both TNF and IL-6 would result in improved efficacy. Using backtranslation from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from individuals with RA, we hypothesized that TNF and IL-6 act synergistically on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and T cells. Coculture of FLS from individuals with RA and T cells supported this hypothesis, revealing effects on both disease-driving pathways and biomarkers. Combining anti-TNF and anti-IL-6 antibodies in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse models resulted in sustained long-term remission, improved histology, and effects on bone remodeling pathways. These promising data initiated the development of an anti-TNF/IL-6 bispecific nanobody compound 1, with similar potencies against TNF and IL-6. We observed additive efficacy of compound 1 in a FLS/T cell coculture affecting arthritis and T helper 17 (T(H)17) pathways. This nanobody compound transcript signature inversely overlapped with described RA endotypes, indicating a potential efficacy in a broader patient population. In summary, we showed superiority of a bispecific anti-TNF/IL-6 nanobody compound or combination treatment over monospecific treatments in both in vitro and in vivo models. We anticipate improved efficacy in upcoming clinical studies. Cluster, Industriepark Hoechst, 65926 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Main, Germany.

These models are built on disease mechanisms and then parametrized using (clinical study) data. Clinical variability among patients is represented by alternative model parameterizations, called virtual patients. Despite the complexity of disease modeling itself, using individual patient data to build these virtual patients is particularly challenging given the high-dimensional, potentially sparse and noisy clinical trial data. In this work, we investigate the applicability of simulation-based inference (SBI), an advanced probabilistic machine learning approach, for virtual patient generation from individual patient data and we develop and evaluate the concept of nearest patient fits (SBI NPF), which further enhances the fitting performance. At the example of rheumatoid arthritis where prediction of treatment response is notoriously difficult, our experiments demonstrate that the SBI approaches can capture large inter-patient variability in clinical data and can compete with standard fitting methods in the field. Moreover, since SBI learns a probability distribution over the virtual patient parametrization, it naturally provides the probability for alternative parametrizations.

        "Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) models provide mechanistic insights into the dynamic interactions between complex pathophysiological reactions and pharmacological interventions, which yield dynamic responses of protein biomarkers and clinical endpoints (Bradshaw et al., 2019; Sorger et al., 2011). Different model parameterizations can represent variability in disease mechanisms and thereby capture a large range of patients and endotypes. An individual parameter set \nθ\n for the QSP model is here denoted as a virtual patient and determines its biomarker and disease score response to a specific treatment (\nQSPθ\n. Finding and identifying these parameterizations \nθ\n within the disease biology network allows us to model and assess virtual patients individually and predict their disease progression and treatment response to novel drugs.",
        "The generation of virtual patients is either driven by hypothesis, to capture, for example, high-level features of responses observed in the clinic where no data is available (Friedrich, 2016), or driven by collected clinical outcome data. Often, such data comes as summary statistics over the patient population and requires the use of parameter searches and parameter weighting methods (e.g., prevalence weighting (Klinke, 2008; Howell et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2016)). Ideally, the clinical data includes individual patient-level data which makes an explicit fit of real patients possible (Björnsson et al., 2019; Allen et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2022). The latter approach requires data preparation, high performance fitting algorithms and efficient computation pipelines to achieve a robust quantitative representation of several hundreds of patients given noisy, locally sparse and high-dimensional individual clinical data. Since the results of the individual patient fits are used to guide drug development decisions, we here seek a broad understanding of virtual patients in terms of how likely it is that they indeed describe the real patient data.",
        "Integrating machine learning (ML) approaches to QSP modeling is a powerful strategy to tackle the computational challenges associated with mechanistic modeling of such complex biological systems (reviewed extensively in (Aghamiri et al., 2022) and (Zhang et al., 2022)). ML has been successfully implemented in parameter estimation (Wajima et al., 2009), model-order reduction (Derbalah et al., 2022), virtual patient generation (Rieger et al., 2018; Parikh et al., 2022) and the assessment of stochastic effects (McComb et al., 2022).",
        "Here, we investigate the applicability of a novel ML approach for building virtual patients. We use simulation-based inference (SBI) that has, to the best of our knowledge, not been applied to such large QSP models yet. As an example, we use a proprietary QSP model for rheumatoid arthritis and fit it to individual patient data where patients have been treated with an anti-TNF drug. SBI approaches are advanced ML techniques for inferring a parameterization of a simulator given prior knowledge and empirical data (Lueckmann et al., 2021). While classic fitting algorithms output a point estimate for a parametrization (Byrd et al., 2000; Egea et al., 2009), SBI produces a probability distribution over the parametrization space, yielding a much more informative result. Prior knowledge in terms of an expert-designed reference patient parametrization is used to build an initial belief about the desired probability distribution. The belief then gets updated based on clinical data observations. The resulting learned probability distribution provides the probability of specific patient parameterizations and thus technically makes it possible to not only discover a single patient parameterization of high probability but multiple ones. The probability distribution could hence be used to generate new realistic virtual patients during in silico trials that may participate in future studies.",
        "In a second step, we propose to leverage knowledge from already built virtual patients (from the same population) to enhance the performance of the algorithm. Instead of using the reference parametrization as prior knowledge for a new patient fit, we use an already learned parametrization of a similar patient. The so-called nearest patient fit (SBI NPF) thus starts from an improved initial belief. We expect a more consistent fit among patients of similar type, which would support an easier identification of virtual patient subgroups. To identify a similar patient, we define a vicinity criterion on the clinical data.",
        "The individual patient data was taken from the MONARCH study [NCT02332590, anti-TNF study arm: n = 155 (Burmester et al., 2017; Gabay et al., 2017; Gaby et al., 2020)]. A total of 133 patients were used for individual patient fitting. Individual patients were fitted amongst others to cell counts (lymphocytes, macrophages), blood protein biomarkers (CRP, MMP-3, RANKL, OPG, OC, CXCL13, sICAM-1 and IL6) as well as clinical readouts (SJC28, TJC28, DAS28-CRP). The data was taken at baseline until 24 weeks of treatment with up to eight measurement time points.

The QSP model is shown in Supplementary Figure S1 (supplement).",
        "The reference parametrization of the QSP model is a pre-implemented solution to an anti-TNF treatment based on various clinical, in vitro and animal in vivo experiments ranging from mechanistic to clinical outcome data (Biesemann et al., 2023).",
        "Global sensitivity analysis allows us to determine the importance of QSP parameters on relevant simulation outputs. The analysis was performed during drug treatment, since this is the for the parameter optimization relevant scenario. We defined the parameter ranges by a ±30% interval around the reference parametrization and used Saltelli’s sampling scheme (provided by the Python SALib module https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#sobol-sensitivity-analysis, version 1.3.12). For a given parameter \nθi\n and a relevant QSP output variable \nXj\n we calculated the total order sensitivity index \nSXj,θi\n following the Sobol procedure (Sobol, 2001). To deduce a single sensitivity value for each parameter \nθi\n, we aggregated the total order sensitivity \nSXj,θi\n over the relevant output variables weighted by their variance as\nSθiagg=∑j=1nSXj,θiVarXj∑j=1nVarXj\n(1)",
        "Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a class of methods which apply statistical inference to learn the parameters of stochastic simulators (Lueckmann et al., 2021), and hence are applicable for learning parameters of QSP models. Statistical inference combines a prior distribution with empirical observations to conclude a posterior distribution. More precisely, given a prior probability distribution \npθ\n over a parametrization \nθ∈Rn\n and observed data \nxo∈Rd\n, it deduces the posterior probability distribution \npθxo\n. Following Bayes theorem (Lee, 1989), the posterior is calculated based on the likelihood function \npx|θ\n. Since the analytical or numerical computation of the likelihood function is often intractable for complex simulations (Cranmer et al., 2020), SBI estimates the posterior in a “likelihood-free” manner, only relying on samples of the simulator \nx ∼ simθ\n.",
        "In this work, we evaluate an SBI approach which learns the posterior distribution with a density estimation neural network (neural posterior estimation). More precisely, the desired posterior \npθx\n is assumed to be a member of a family of probability densities \nqκ\n parametrized by \nκ\n that can be of various not-predefined shapes (e.g., multimodal). The distribution parameters \nκ\n are learned with a neural network \nFx,w\n, where \nw\n denotes the adjustable weights of the neural network and \nx\n denotes its input, i.e., \npθ|x≈qFx,wθ.\n The weights of the neural network are trained by minimizing the loss function \nLw=∑i=1M−⁡log⁡qFxi,wθi\n over generated training samples \nθi,xii\n where the parameters \nθi\n are sampled from the prior \nθi ∼ pθ\n and the corresponding simulation results \nxi\n are sampled from the QSP model \nxi ∼ QSPθi\n. Since QSP simulations are expensive, we use the sample efficient algorithm sequential neural posterior estimation (Greenberg et al., 2019). Only those training samples (\nθi,xi\n) are considered relevant, where the simulation result \nxi\n is close to the clinical data \nxo\n of the patient to be fitted. Such training samples are generated by drawing parametrizations \nθi\n from a sequentially refined posterior estimate \np∼θ|x\n which is called proposal posterior, cf.\nFigure 1, point 3. Since the posterior under a proposal does not coincide with the desired posterior under the prior, the authors in (Greenberg et al., 2019) present a re-parameterization of the problem to automatically transform between estimates of the proposal posterior \np∼θ|x\n and the true desired posterior \npθx\n. The sequential procedure leads to more informative and thus overall fewer training samples from the simulator.",

        "To run the selected SBI approach, a variety of hyperparameters must be configured which are problem specific. First, to reduce the complexity of the optimization task, we selected an appropriate subset of the QSP parameters for fitting using global sensitivity analysis (Section 2.3) and expert knowledge. Second, we chose a prior distribution over the fitting parameters. Third, we selected the neural network-based density estimator \nF\n which models the posterior, the number of rounds in the sequential procedure of the algorithm as well as the number of samples drawn per round used to produce a posterior estimate.",
        "Additional tuning of data and simulation outcome was applied: To handle the measurement noise of the patient data, we introduced (multiplicative lognormal) noise to the QSP simulation output during training leading to a stochastic simulator. We considered the scale parameter of the lognormally distributed noise as a fitting parameter which allowed us to regulate and learn the appropriate amount of noise per patient.",
        "Due to the high dimensionality of the patient data, we reduced it to summary statistics for fitting. More precisely, we represented each biomarker timeseries by its median and the difference between its 0.9- and 0.1-quantile, indicating the rate with which a biomarker increases or decreases. For 16 biomarkers, this resulted in a 32-dimensional representation of the clinical data.",
        "The described SBI algorithm fits each patient individually and independently. We investigated an additional approach for boosting the performance by leveraging knowledge of an already learned similar patient.",
        "Since the raw biomarker time series data in the clinical study is sparse, we used the introduced representation of the clinical data in terms of a set of statistical features and computed the similarity between patients as the Euclidean distance in the normalized feature space. More precisely, we used the Euclidean metric proposed in (Dixon, 1979) which is designed for the presence of missing data since not all patients have measurements for all 16 biomarkers:\ndPi,Pj=∑b∈CB2CB32medianPi,b−medianPj,b2+Q0.9Pi,b−Q0.1Pj,b2\n(2)\nwhere \nCB\n denotes the set of common biomarkers of patient \nPi\n and patient \nPj\n, \nmedian\n (\nPi,b\n) is the normalized median of biomarker b for patient \nPi\n, and \nQxPi,b\n for \nx∈0,1\n is the normalized x-quantile.",
        "To implement the suggested nearest patient fit approach, we considered the fitting process of the patient cohort as a sequential procedure, cf.\nFigure 1. In each step, we fit a batch of patients in parallel and the procedure terminates when all patients are fitted. Throughout the process, the knowledge we gain from successful patient fits is collected in a so-called knowledge container which makes the knowledge available for the subsequent patient fitting experiments. The developed pipeline is described in detail in the following:• The knowledge container is initialized with the reference patient, which is generated with the reference parametrization in the QSP model (Figure 1, step 1).• A processing module selects a batch of patients for fitting (Figure 1, step 2), which are nearest to the current patients in the container according to our similarity metric (Equation 2). The prior for each patient fit is defined based on the learned parametrization of its most similar patient in the knowledge container.• Each selected patient is fitted with the SBI algorithm (Figure 1, step 3).• The quality of each resulting patient-specific posterior distribution is assessed by a processing module (Figure 1, step 4). If the learned parameterization is better than the reference parametrization according to the loss function in Section 2.6, the patient fit is put into the knowledge container. If not, its knowledge is not reused for the subsequent SBI experiments, but it is still part of our learned virtual patient population (Figure 1, step 5).",

Parameter bounds have been set twofold around the reference parametrization. The computation time for a single patient fit was set to 4 h, which met the convergence criterion.",
        "An individual patient fit yields a QSP parametrization \nθ\n.

As biomarker values may be on different scales, we used a maximum-scaling for equal weighting. Since all considered fitting algorithms (SBI, SSm, fmincon) start from the reference parametrization \nθref\n, we evaluated their performance against the reference parameterization in terms of relative loss reduction as\ngapθ,c=Lθref,c−Lθ,cLθref,c\n(4)\nwhere \nθ\n denotes the parametrization determined by the respective fitting algorithm. \ngap <0\n depicts worse data fits than the reference parameterization while \ngap>0\n depicts improved data fits over the reference parameterization with \ngap=1\n as the best possible case. \ngap=0\n depicts no improvement over the reference parameterization.",
        "For SBI, which produces a probability distribution over the parametrization, we defined the ultimate parametrization \nθsbi\n as the best one out of 100 samples drawn from the posterior. To evaluate the quality of the posterior distribution, we also reported the fraction of samples which are better than the reference parametrization,\nfracDpost,c=∑k=11001Lθk,sbi,c<Lθref,c100\n(5)\nwhere \nθk,sbi\n denotes the k-th drawn sample from the learned posterior distribution \nDpost\n and \n1\n is the indicator function.",
        "The hyperparameters which control the sequential training procedure (e.g., number of rounds) as well as the architecture of the density estimation neural network, were optimized with grid search (see Table 1 for an overview of the determined hyperparameter values). A relevant subset of 25 QSP parameters was selected for fitting based on biological expert knowledge, which is often a reasonable first step (Cheng et al., 2022), and global sensitivity analysis results. Figure 2 shows thirteen parameters identified as key determinants of the model output by expert priority (A), as well as the twelve most sensitive parameters (of the remaining ones) identified by global sensitivity analysis (B) (Equation 1). The parameters selected by expert priority were categorized into “immune cell numbers in blood”, “sensitivity of immune processes to cytokine levels” and “simulation of immune cells”. Variability in the expert priority parameters across virtual patients leads to variability in cell populations that play a significant role in disease pathophysiology and response to treatment. Note that the aggregated Sobol indices of the expert priority parameters are comparable to those of the high sensitivity parameters.",

        "For the 25 fitting parameters we chose a lognormal prior distribution \nLogNormalloc,scale\n centered around the reference parametrization with parameters \nloc=⁡log θref\n and \nscale=0.25\n. As the reference parametrization \nθref\n simulates a typical patient, the prior can be an informed starting point for an individual patient fit. The lognormal distribution was chosen to keep the range of parameter values positive. Moreover, it covers the different scales of the parameters with a single scale value since by definition the amount of variance caused by the scale parameter also depends on the parameter \nloc\n (the higher \nloc\n, the higher the variance) For SBI NPF we derived the prior from the knowledge container (see Section 3.4) by centering the lognormal distribution around the parametrization of the patient’s nearest container patient (and using the same scale value as above).",
        "Individual patient fits were performed for the presented SBI approaches as well as for the selected benchmarks (SSm, fmincon) and evaluated according to the loss function in Equation 3. For each method, the distribution of the loss over all patients is depicted in Figure 3A. All fitting algorithms lead to loss curves with smaller mean loss values and smaller variance compared to the reference. For each patient fit, the relative reduction of the reference loss is shown in Figure 3B as a distribution over the population. The fitting performance range is spanned by the two benchmarks fmincon and SSm. While the performance distribution of SBI resembles fmincon, SBI NPF yields a clear improvement which is similar to the SSm performance distribution. For both SBI approaches there are a few outlier patients, for which the reference is better than the respective SBI result (i.e., negative relative reduction in Figure 3B). When comparing the losses patient-wise, SBI NPF improves over SBI for 82% of the patients. SBI NPF does not only outperform SBI in terms of the best posterior sample but also in terms of the whole learned posterior distribution, cf.\nFigure 3C. It shows that for SBI typically 34% out of 100 posterior samples are better than the reference parametrization, while for SBI NPF this number is around 80%. Visual predictive checks on a biomarker level are presented in Figures 4, 5 for the c-reactive protein(CRP) and a disease score (DAS28-CRP). Figure 4 compares the clinical biomarker observations of all patients (y-axis) at all time points to the corresponding simulations of the model with the parameter sets of the respective fitting algorithm (x-axis). This density correlation plot illustrates that, similar to the benchmarks, the SBI approaches are overall able to describe the clinical data sufficiently well. The visual predictive checks also reflect that SBI NPF leads to better fits than SBI. In Figure 5 we depict the distribution of the clinical data and the obtained simulation results (after 24 weeks of treatment) over the patient population. Inter-patient variability is large in the clinical data endpoints and the fitting methods are generally able to capture this variability under the chosen parameter bounds. An example of an individual fit obtained by SBI is shown in the Supplementary Figure S2 for the CRP data. In summary, the empirical evaluations demonstrate that the SBI approaches can compete with classic fitting methods in the field in terms of fitting quality and fitting speed. Moreover, the suggested SBI NPF pipeline significantly improved over SBI.",

Exemplary one-dimensional marginal posteriors are depicted in Figure 6 for three different parameters. One column depicts the marginal distribution for a specific QSP model parameter for three different patients which all started from the same prior (grey). For each parameter (column), the three learned patient-individual posteriors (blue) differ significantly from each other. While a learned posterior can have moved far away from the prior, i.e., the reference parametrization, they can also resemble each other, at least in the one dimension depicted in this figure (similarity of the here depicted one-dimensional marginal prior and posterior does not imply similarity of the 25-dimensional prior and posterior distributions). Overall, we observe multiple shapes of the marginal posteriors, which range from very concentrated distributions to broader and flat ones.",

        "Note that the sampled parameter sets from a patient posterior distribution contain between-parameter relationships (example given in the supplement as parallel coordinate plot, see Supplementary Figure S3) and can be used to explore correlations (example given in the supplement as correlation matrix, see Supplementary Figure S4).",
        "QSP models are typically built in several steps. Individual mechanistic parameters, such as binding or dissociation as well as mechanistic pathway modules are first calibrated based on in vitro and in vivo experiments and, in the final step, are then fitted to clinical study data such as biomarker concentrations and disease activity endpoints (Cheng et al., 2022).",
        "Often this clinical data is only available as summary statistics, which requires weighting methods to ensure a proper distribution of the inferred parameter sets (Klinke, 2008; Schmidt et al., 2013). It requires difficult assumptions on which patients may exist in the real world and has consequences for prediction of drug efficacy.",
        "Fitting of individual clinical data circumvents these assumptions but is limited, in good cases, to only a few hundred patients where the individual data is often provided without uncertainty statistics (such as standard deviation). The lack of uncertainty statistics denies the use of sophisticated approaches for generating alternative parameterizations for a single patient, such as bootstrapping (Tibshirani and Efron, 1986).",
        "By applying a simulation-based inference method, we generated parameter probability distributions during the patient fit, directly providing alternative parametrizations for real patients. More precisely, sampling from the probability distributions yield different highly likely parametrizations for an individual patient, which can then be used to achieve a larger virtual patient population. Thus, the above-mentioned limitations of individual patient data have been overcome and the generated virtual population is based on real patients, which is advantageous compared to weighting methods and their assumptions.",
        "The subsequent validation of the generated virtual population, either from individual patient fitting or from hypothesis-based methods, is usually achieved by predicting the population outcome of other studies, for example, drugs with different mode of action or different dosing schemes, under consideration of the baseline characteristics of the study population.",
        "In this work, we employ SBI to learn a distribution over the QSP model parametrization for an individual rheumatoid arthritis patient and build a virtual patient from it. The goal is to identify regions in the parameter space which best explain the patient observations, i.e., where the corresponding simulated biomarker values match the patient’s clinical data.",
        "The approach is particularly interesting for the described setup since there may exist multiple optimal QSP parametrizations to model the patient data. The learned probability distribution in the parameter space naturally provides the probability of certain parameterizations and can be used to explore alternative parameterizations. Another benefit of SBI is that it treats the simulation as a black box, similar to SSm and fmincon.",
        "There exists a variety of SBI algorithms in the literature, see (Lueckmann et al., 2021) for a detailed overview, from which we chose the sample-efficient algorithm sequential neural posterior estimation. The choice of the SBI approach as well as of the stochastic global and deterministic local approach can yield differences in the benchmarking as their performance needs to be considered as partially problem specific (Egea et al., 2009). Furthermore, the applied data statistics and the data noise handling can influence the result performance.",
        "Within this challenging optimization problem, algorithms and settings of hyperparameters are an impactful choice that is based on the underlying optimization criterion and performance assumptions. Alternative hyperparameter settings may yield similar or better results and can be subject of further analysis.",
        "To reduce the complexity of the optimization problem and to achieve high quality model fits, we selected the most relevant parameters for model fitting by assessing the parameter influence on biomarker-related model outputs through global sensitivity analysis (Sobol, 2001). In addition, expert priority parameters have been included in the parameter estimation (Cheng et al., 2022). The quantitative choice of 25 parameters seems arbitrary but alternative parameter numbers did not improve the result of the parameter estimation.",
        "The results of this work demonstrate that fitting of individual patients can yield virtual patients that each outperform the reference and that the model parameterizations can represent the variability in clinical response typically seen in the data. The variability in the patient data was very high, cf.\nFigure 5, which is expected for rheumatoid arthritis as heterogeneous disease, and poses a real challenge for individual patient fitting but also for predicting response (Rehberg et al., 2021). Obviously, the inter-patient variability is a consequence of phenotypic differences and measurement noise. As noise cannot be explained biologically with the mechanistic QSP model, a perfect correlation between clinical data and model predictions in Figure 4 is difficult to achieve (see also (Schmidt et al., 2013)). Yet the discussed algorithms show a different fitting performance with fmincon performing worst, SSm performing best and SBI being in between. Fmincon generally is less suited for our optimization task than the others as it searches for a local and not necessarily global optimum. While fmincon and SSm provide only point estimates, SBI provides a distribution, i.e., multiple parameter estimates with corresponding probabilities. We note that the fitting approach with SBI uses summary statistics of the clinical data and not its raw observations like the benchmarks, which could be a disadvantage. Yet overall, the SBI approaches get reasonably close to SSm. Our results also illustrate that SBI can handle a high-dimensional parameter space of 25 parameters and make them suited for such kind of QSP problems. For comparison, SBI approaches in the literature focused, so far, on setups of only 2–10 parameters (Lueckmann et al., 2021; Reza et al., 2022; Boelts et al., 2023; Boyali et al., 2021). The fact that SBI could be improved with SBI NPF for 82% of the patients demonstrates a high potential of the nearest patient fit pipeline developed in this work. It showcases the influence and necessity of good prior estimates for SBI algorithms. However, 18% of the patients were better fitted with SBI, which starts from a presumably less appropriate prior distribution. While SBI approaches are inherently stochastic, the impact on fitting quality was minor in repetitive experiments. We must assume that the SBI NPF pipeline has room for improvement in defining the patient vicinity criteria and/or that patient vicinity is not always of benefit, as a QSP model may require very different parametrizations to produce similar outputs (Duffull and Gulati, 2020). To conclude on the SBI NPF pipeline, the developed concept of nearest patient fits is not specific to SBI but represents a generic contribution that can be transferred to any fitting algorithm which considers initial solutions.",
        "The patient-specific posterior marginal distributions show that very diverse QSP model parametrizations can be necessary to describe individual patients well, which SBI was able to learn. The different shapes of the marginal posteriors indicate the flexibility of the chosen SBI approach (sequential neural posterior estimation) in modelling probability distributions. While concentrated distributions can indicate a high certainty in the virtual patient parametrizations, flat distributions may point towards those that are uncertain. One advantage of the learned distributions is that alternative virtual patient parametrizations can directly be generated through sampling. I.e., new highly-probable patient fits can be easily generated without re-running the optimization solver or using other metrics and assumptions such as prevalence weighting. These alternate parameterizations of a virtual patient may describe the fitted data equally well and may represent differences in the disease mechanisms. Exploring alternate parametrizations is fundamental to assess the range of treatment outcomes of an individual patient.",
        "On the population level, aggregation of the given patient-specific posterior distributions may allow the application of population statistics for assessment of subgroups, patient differences and population spread.",
        "In this work, we find SBI approaches to be powerful tools in creating virtual patients using individual patient data. SBI achieved the same performance in patient fits compared to benchmark algorithms and provides parameter probability distributions, which can be used to explore alternative parameterizations for real patients to create more confidence in predicting clinical outcomes for in silico trials. Furthermore, leveraging patient similarities observed in the clinical data, improved the performance and may be suited as a generalizable strategy in generating virtual patients.",

        "In osteoarthritis, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are gaining popularity as a disease‐modifying treatment because of their ease of harvesting, safety 1, 2, and potential to differentiate into cartilage tissue 3, 4, 5. Furthermore, MSCs have been known for paracrine 6, 7, 8, anti‐inflammatory 9, 10, and immunomodulatory effects 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 through the release of several growth factors and cytokines 1, 2, 16. Because the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis is based on both degeneration and inflammation, the paracrine effect, reducing of immune response, and stimulation of local tissue repair with the properties of MSCs would be beneficial to improve the intra‐articular environment as a disease‐modifying treatment 11, 12, 17, 18. Successful pain relief, functional improvement, and even cartilage regeneration have been reported in clinical studies of the intra‐articular injection of MSCs for knee osteoarthritis 1, 2, 16, 19. However, besides the study of Vega et al. 16, most studies were not randomized or blinded and did not have a comparative group 1, 2, 19. Some previous studies used allogeneic MSCs 16, 20, and their use has been concerning because of the theoretical potential for adverse effects such as tumorigenesis or host immune rejection when compared with autologous MSCs, although no severe adverse effects have been reported. Our previous phase I/IIa trial 2 reported the clinical efficacy and safety after using an intra‐articular injection of autologous adipose tissue‐derived MSCs (AD‐MSCs) with high dose (1 × 108 cells). However, the study 2 performed the intra‐articular injection of AD‐MSCs after arthroscopic lavage procedure in the operating room. Therefore, there might be performance bias as clinical and structural improvements would be affected by surgical procedures. In addition, there was an open label test without control group 2.",
        "Therefore, we conducted a current phase IIb clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a single intra‐articular injection of high‐dose (1 × 108 cells), autologous AD‐MSCs in patients with knee osteoarthritis through randomized, double‐blinded, and placebo‐controlled study in the outpatient setting, without limitation of daily activity. We report the clinical and radiological outcome after a single intra‐articular injection of autologous AD‐MSCs.",
        "The present study was performed between June 2015 and December 2016 in two orthopedic centers. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of both institutes, and Korea Food and Drug Administration. This was designed as a randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled study in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Eligible patients were between 18 and 75 years of age with osteoarthritis of the knee joint (Kellgren‐Lawrence grade 2 to 4) 21 and had an mean pain intensity of 4 or more on a 10‐point visual analog scale (VAS) for at least 12 weeks (supplemental online Appendix 1). Patients underwent physical examination; laboratory tests such as routine blood and urine tests, serologic test, tumor screening, electrocardiogram, and pregnancy test if indicated; and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee at screening with informed consent. To objectively assess cartilage regeneration, we enrolled patients with at least one focal or localized grade 3 or 4 lesion on MRI scan. All pain medications were discontinued except the rescue analgesic. All participants who were identified as eligible for clinical trials returned to the hospital within 1 week for lipoaspiration. All lipoaspiration procedures were performed in the outpatient clinic. According to the randomization, participants were blindly assigned to AD‐MSCs injection (MSC group) or normal saline injection (control group). Three weeks after lipoaspiration, one of autologous AD‐MSC injection or normal saline injection was administered intra‐articularly in the outpatient clinic. No specific physical limitation was recommended from the day after the injection. Patients were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months after the injection. At each visit, the efficacy and safety evaluation were performed. Furthermore, simple radiograph and MRI of the knee were obtained at 3 and 6 months after the injection in all patients. The rescue analgesic was defined as an approved medication for patients' pain control. The rescue medication that was permitted was acetaminophen at a dose of 4,000 mg or less per day. Other analgesics were not permitted, and any medications that patients were taking were recorded. If the participant had an osteoarthritis medication, the drug was discontinued for 2 weeks as a wash‐out period.",
        "All the procedures were performed with an informed consent. AD‐MSCs (Jointstem; R‐Bio, Seoul, Korea) used in the current study were isolated and cultured based on a previously reported study 22. Adipose tissues of patients were obtained by lipoaspiration from abdominal subcutaneous fat under Good Manufacturing Practices conditions. Lipoaspiration was performed using the tumescent technique, which was defined as 3–5 cc of infiltrate per 1 cc of aspirate at 3 weeks before injection 23, 24. The process of lipoaspiration was as follows: (a) sterile skin preparation; (b) local anesthesia using 2% lidocaine; (c) stab incision (2 mm) using number 11 mass; (d) injection of tumescent solution into the subcutaneous fat layer of the harvesting site; (e) after 10–15 minutes, approximately 20 mL of adipose tissue was collected using an metal cannula connected to a 10 cc syringe; (f) the collected fat‐tumescent solution was kept at 2°C–8°C in a sterile bag and transported to the laboratory; and (g) wound suture (number 5 blue nylon) and dressing. Aspirated tissues were digested with collagenase I (1 mg/mL) under gentle agitation for 60 minutes at 37°C 22. The digested tissues were filtered through a 100‐mm nylon sieve to remove cellular debris and were centrifuged to obtain a pellet. The pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, USA)‐based media containing 0.2 mM ascorbic acid and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cell suspension was recentrifuged. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was collected. The cell fraction was cultured for 4–5 days in Keratinocyte‐SFM (Invitrogen, USA)‐based media containing 0.2 mM ascorbic acid, 0.09 mM calcium, 5 ng/mL recombinant epidermal growth factor (rEGF), and 5% FBS until confluent (passage 0). When the cells reached 90% confluency, they were passaged. AD‐MSCs from the control group were also cultured until passage 1. The cells were then frozen and stored at liquid nitrogen cell storage (−196°C), which might be the most common method of storing cells safely for a long period in most laboratories 25. All of the AD‐MSCs used in this study were collected at passage 3. Culture‐expanded cells were then tested for cell number, viability, purity (CD31, CD34, CD45), identity (CD 73, CD 90), sterility (bacterial and fungal), and endotoxin and mycoplasma contamination as recommended by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 (21CFR), before shipping. Cultured AD‐MSCs maintained a survival rate of more than 80% for 72 hours at 2°C–8°C 22. This high level of purity was demonstrated by the consistent expression of positive or negative surface antigen for MSC up to 72 hours. Thus, the cells were made and shipped on the day of injection, with a survival rate of at least 87% (average 92.8%) for 72 hours. And the MSCs were injected into the knee joint in the outpatient clinic within an hour after being delivered to the hospital.",
        "All injections were administered once into the patient's knee joint under the ultrasound guidance. Intra‐articular injection was performed by a specialized physician who was not involved in the entire evaluations of the participants. Also, neither the physician nor the patient was aware of who was receiving AD‐MSCs, hence double blinding the study. In the MSC group, 1 × 108 cells of AD‐MSCs in 3 mL of saline was administered intra‐articularly, and in the control group, 3 mL of saline (NaCl 9 mg/mL) was administered intra‐articularly under the ultrasound guidance. The dose of cell injection was determined by the result of the previous study 2.",
        "The clinical evaluation was performed by a blinded physician. Primary outcome was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) 26 at 6 months after intra‐articular injection.",
        "Secondary outcomes were categorized into clinical scores, physical examination, radiologic examination, and safety. Clinical scores included a 10‐point VAS for knee pain and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) 27. Physical examination included range of motion, quadriceps power, presence of joint effusion, presence of joint crepitus, presence of medial joint line tenderness, and presence of pes anserinus tenderness.",
        "Radiologic outcomes were measured with Kellgren‐Lawrence (K‐L) grade 21, joint space width of medial and lateral compartment 28, 29, and hip‐knee‐ankle (HKA) angle 30 using simple radiograph. MRI was evaluated before injection and 3 and 6 months after injection. MRI was performed using a 3.0‐T scanner (Achieva 3.0‐T; Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, Netherlands) with an 8‐channel knee coil. The maximum gradient strength was 80 mT/m, and the maximum slew rate was 100 mT/m/ms. The images were transferred digitally to a picture archiving and communication system (PiView STAR, Seoul, Korea). Radiologic measurements were performed using the electronic calipers and goniometer provided in the software.",
        "The size and depth of cartilage defects was also measured using MRI by two blinded musculoskeletal radiologists. Depth of the cartilage defect in MRI was classified according to the modified Noyes grading system 31. For calculating size of the cartilage defect in MRI, the maximum diameter of the cartilage defect with modified Noyes 31 grade 3 and 4 in each compartment was analyzed in the sagittal (anteroposterior) and coronal (mediolateral) images. Size of the cartilage defect was measured by multiplying the anteroposterior and the mediolateral diameter 2. If multiple defects existed in one compartment, the highest grade was selected. Calculated size of the cartilage defects was compared within each group and between both groups after the injection.",
        "The safety was analyzed with vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests (supplemental online Appendix 2), and adverse events. The severity of adverse events was based on the National Cancer Institute‐Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI‐CTCAE) 32. When adverse events occurred, the cause‐and‐relationship between injection and adverse events was recorded according to the World Health Organization‐Uppsala Monitoring Centre causality assessment system 33.",
        "Because the primary outcome was the difference in WOMAC score between baseline and 6 months, sample size was set based on the results of the previous study (α risk 0.05, power 0.8, changes in WOMAC score 21.3, and SD 19.12) 2. The required number of patients was determined to be five. Considering the representative clinical trial and dropout rate, we decided to recruit 12 patients in each group. Outcome measures were analyzed based on the intention‐to‐treat population. Data are reported as means ± SD. Unpaired t test was used to assess efficacy before and after injection, and McNemar's test or Bowker's test was used for categorical variables. The analysis was performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS institute, Inc., Cary, NC).",

        "The most important finding of this study was that a single intra‐articular injection of autologous AD‐MSCs in patients with osteoarthritic knees led to satisfactory clinical and functional improvement without adverse events over 6 months of follow‐up. All procedures were accompanied with the outpatient clinic setting. Patients in the MSC group demonstrated significantly improved WOMAC scores, which was the primary outcome of this study. This single injection of AD‐MSCs significantly led to a 55% reduction in the WOMAC total score, 59% in the WOMAC pain score, 54% in the WOMAC stiffness score, and 54% in the WOMAC physical function score at 6 months after injection. Previous studies 1, 2, 16, 19 showed that the clinical outcomes improved at 6 months after MSC injection. This is consistent with the results of this study. Moreover, similar to some previous studies 16, 19, clinical outcomes were well maintained even at 6 months after injection. This finding suggests that symptom improvement can be well maintained over 6 months with a single intra‐articular MSC injection. Therefore, intra‐articular injection of MSCs would be a viable option for the treatment of degenerative osteoarthritis of the knee as a simple method without concomitant surgical procedures, and it is able to be carried out in the outpatient clinic.",
        "Several types of MSCs have been used for an intra‐articular injection in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis 1, 2, 16, 19. Orozco et al. 1, 19 used autologous bone marrow (BM)‐derived MSCs for the intra‐articular injection. They reported significant improvement in clinical scores over 12 months after the injection. Vega et al. 16 performed a randomized controlled study of allogenic BM‐MSCs in patients with K‐L grade 2 to 4 osteoarthritis. They reported significantly improved pain and cartilage quality, but the efficacy for pain was smaller than that reported with autologous BM‐MSCs 1. However, direct comparisons are difficult because the former study 1 was uncontrolled. Both previous and present studies using high‐dose AD‐MSCs 2 showed similar improvements in pain VAS and WOMAC scores. In the previous study 2, a high dose of AD‐MSCs was injected after concomitant arthroscopy. In contrast, in the present study, a single intra‐articular injection of AD‐MSCs was performed in the outpatient setting. Moreover, whereas the previous study 2 was an open‐label test without a control group, the present study was a randomized, double‐blinded, and placebo‐controlled design. However, it is difficult to determine the actual differences in intra‐articular injections of BM‐MSCs and AD‐MSCs because the researches differ in study design, cell type, presence of adjunctive therapy, and rehabilitation protocols 1, 2, 5, 16, 19. Meanwhile, there are various options as to whether to use “autologous” or “allogeneic” MSCs for intra‐articular injection 5, 16, 34. Theoretically, autologous MSCs have been known to be safe because they do not result in antibody formation 5. The risk of tumorigenesis, disease transmission, and possibility of host immune rejection after use of allogeneic MSCs is still a concern 20. In contrast, donor site morbidity to harvest autologous MSCs would be a negative point compared with allogeneic MSCs 16. Moreover, autologous MSCs should not be recommended for genetic disorders 35. Rather, in patients with genetic disorders, allogeneic MSCs would be a reasonable option for the treatment 16, 35. In a previous study 16 using allogeneic MSCs for intra‐articular injections, few major adverse events were reported, and improvements in clinical outcomes were similar to studies using autologous MSCs 1, 2, 19. However, further clinical research including safety and efficacy evaluation would be necessary for clinical practice of an intra‐articular injection of allogeneic MSCs.",
        "Previous studies 1, 2, 16, 19 have reported chondral changes after the intra‐articular injection of MSCs in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Some studies 1, 16, 19 measuring structural changes after MSCs injection reported on cartilage regeneration at 6 months after injection using T2 relaxation time and poor cartilage index on MRI. In the previous study 2, cartilage regeneration could be seen in the second‐look arthroscopy at 6 months after the AD‐MSCs injection. In the present study, we could not find significant cartilage regeneration in MRI at 6 months after the injection. However, the cartilage defect was increased in the control group but maintained in the MSC group (p = .0051). Moreover, unlike the previous study that recommended partial weight‐bearing with crutches for 8 weeks after injection 2, we allowed normal daily activities without any restriction or support. Because Orozco et al. 19 reported a continuous improvement in cartilage quality over a 2‐year follow‐up from the baseline, we expect cartilage improvement in our series with a longer follow‐up. Chondral changes over time will require further research.",
        "Concerns about safety of MSCs remain among clinicians and patients. According to previous trials 16, 35, 36, 37, there were no major adverse events, but some patients commonly reported joint pain, swelling, and difficulty with movement in a temporary period. One previous systemic analysis 5 was performed with clinical trials on autologous BM‐MSCs. The literature found no serious adverse events with a mean follow‐up of 21 months. The evidences are consistent with the present study in that an intra‐articular injection of MSCs appeared to be safe during the short‐term period. Nonetheless, further research is necessary for mid‐ to long‐term adverse events.",
        "Our study had some limitations. First, a small number of patients participated in this randomized, double‐blinded, and placebo‐controlled study. It was performed as a pilot, phase IIb clinical trial, prior to multicenter and large cohort study in the phase III clinical trials. Second, because the WOMAC score was a primary outcome, this sample size is insufficient to adequately analyze the radiologic outcomes. Further larger sample size would be necessary to confirm these findings. Third, the follow‐up period was 6 months. There might be unexpected outcomes regarding clinical efficacy, adverse events, and structural outcomes in the long‐term follow‐up. In the future, long‐term studies with large sample sizes will be needed.",
        "An intra‐articular injection of autologous AD‐MSCs provided satisfactory functional improvement and pain relief for patients with knee osteoarthritis in the outpatient setting, without causing adverse events at 6 months' follow‐up. Larger sample size and long‐term follow‐up is required.",

    "title": "Long-term efficacy of B cell depletion therapy on lung and skin involvement in diffuse systemic sclerosis. courses of rituximab therapy in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients with and without lung disease. METHODS: A total of 20 SSc patients with a diffuse disease were treated with rituximab. At baseline and during follow-up the lung involvement was evaluated with pulmonary function tests (FVC and DLCO) and with lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). RESULTS: The skin score, activity, and severity indices improved significantly after 12 months and at final follow-up compared to baseline. After 12 months, there was a significant increase of FVC and TLC compared to baseline (p = 0.024 and p = 0.005, respectively), while the mean DLCO value remained stable. Considering the last available follow-up in six patients with restrictive lung disease at baseline, two patients (33.3%) experienced an increase of more than 10% of FVC, one patient had a decrease of FVC >10%, while in three patients FVC remained stable (50%). After the mean follow-up of 48.5 +/- 20.4 months, among the patients with normal lung parameters at baseline, FVC remained stable in 12 (85.7%) and in one patient (14.3%) it increased by more than 10%. At the final follow-up, the alveolar and interstitial HRCT scores remained stable in more than 80% of patients, both in patients with and without restrictive lung disease at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-CD20 B cell depletion therapy is effective on skin involvement but seems also to preserve the pulmonary function, as supported by a stable or improved FVC and stable interstitial score, suggesting a possible role of rituximab as a modifying therapy overall in early diffuse SSc.

        "Systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) encompass a group of chronic and debilitating conditions characterized by dysregulation of the immune system, thereby leading to inflammation and damage across multiple organ systems. SARDs, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), affect millions of people worldwide and pose significant challenges in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management [1].",
        "Despite advances in conventional therapies and the introduction of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, a substantial proportion of patients with SARDs fail to achieve sustained remission or experience recurrent disease flares. The complex pathogenesis of these SARDs, involving multiple immune cell types and inflammatory pathways, underscores the need for novel therapeutic approaches to provide targeted and effective disease control [2].",
        "Recently, the remarkable success of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in treating certain hematological malignancies has attracted interest in its potential applications to SARDs [3]. CAR T-cell are genetically engineered T lymphocytes that express a synthetic receptor capable of recognizing specific antigens and eliciting potent immune response [4]. The ability to redirect T-cell specificity towards chosen targets offers a promising avenue for addressing the underlying immunological aberrations in SARDs [5].",
        "This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape and future prospects of CAR T-cell therapy for SARDs. We examine the mechanistic basis of CAR T-cell function, evaluate ongoing studies and clinical trials, discuss potential cellular and molecular targets, and address the unique challenges and opportunities related to this innovative approach in the context of SARDs.",
        "CAR T-cell therapy is a groundbreaking approach in cellular immunotherapy. At its core, the therapy involves genetic modification of a patient’s own T cells to express a CAR. This synthetic receptor combines the specificity of an antibody with the cytotoxic and proliferative capabilities of T cells [6].",
        "CAR is a sophisticated fusion protein that forms the cornerstone of CAR T-cell therapy. Its structure typically comprises four main components, each crucial for the functionality of CAR T cells [7]. The extracellular antigen-binding domain, responsible for recognizing and binding to the target antigen, is most commonly derived from the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of a monoclonal antibody (mAb). This scFv consists of variable regions of heavy and light chains of an antibody, connected by a flexible linker [8]. Connected to this is the hinge or spacer region, which is a flexible segment that links the antigen-binding domain to the transmembrane domain. Derived from molecules like CD8α, CD28, or IgG4-Fc, this hinge provides optimal spacing and flexibility, allowing the CAR to effectively engage with its target antigen. The length and composition of the hinge can significantly affect the function of CAR T cells and often needs to be optimized for each target antigen [9,10]. The transmembrane domain, typically a hydrophobic α-helix derived from type I membrane proteins, such as CD8, CD28, or CD3ζ, anchors the CAR in the T-cell membrane. The choice of the transmembrane domain can affect the stability and function of the CAR [11,12]. Finally, the intracellular signaling domains are crucial for activating T cells upon antigen recognition. They typically include an activation domain, usually the CD3ζ chain containing three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, and one or more costimulatory domains, most commonly CD28 or 4-1BB (CD137) [12,13]. The precise configuration of these components can be finetuned to optimize various aspects of CAR T-cell functions, including antigen sensitivity, T-cell activation threshold, persistence, and effector functions. This adaptability allows the design of each CAR to be tailored to a specific target antigen depending on the disease context, highlighting the versatility and potential of CAR T-cell therapy in addressing a wide range of medical conditions, including challenging autoimmune disorders such as SARDs.",
        "The processes of CAR T cells production and administration involve several key steps (Figure 1). Initially, the patient’s T cells are harvested by leukapheresis. These cells are genetically modified, usually through viral vector transduction, to express the CAR construct. The modified T cells undergo ex vivo expansion to achieve therapeutic numbers. Prior to CAR T cells infusion, patients typically undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy to create a favorable environment for the engraftment of CAR T cells. Expanded CAR T cells are then reinfused into the patient, where they proliferate and exert their effector functions upon encountering target antigens [14].",
        "The evolution of CAR T-cell technology has been marked by significant advancements aimed at enhancing its efficacy, persistence, and safety. This progression can be categorized into five distinct generations, each based on the strengths of its predecessors while addressing their limitations.",
        "First-generation CAR T cells, developed in the late 1980s, consisted of an extracellular antigen-binding domain derived from an scFv fused to the intracellular signaling domain of CD3ζ [13]. While these pioneering constructs demonstrated the feasibility of redirecting the specificity of T cells, they showed limited in vivo expansion and persistence. To address these shortcomings, second-generation CAR T cells were developed by incorporating a costimulatory domain. This crucial modification, usually involving CD28 or 4-1BB (CD137), markedly enhanced the functionalities of T cells, including improved proliferation, cytokine production, and persistence [15]. The success of this design has been exemplified by therapies approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta), for treating certain hematological malignancies [16].",
        "Third-generation CAR T cells were built on this framework by integrating two costimulatory domains. Common combinations included CD28 with either 4-1BB or OX40, aiming to synergistically boost the activation and longevity of T cells [17]. Although promising in preclinical models, the clinical superiority of the third-generation CARs over their second-generation counterparts remains a subject of ongoing investigation [18].",
        "The advent of fourth-generation CAR T cells, also known as T cells Redirected for Universal Cytokine Killing or armored CARs, has marked a significant leap in design complexity. These sophisticated constructs incorporate additional elements for enhancing their functionality and overcoming the limitations observed in treating solid tumors. These features may include inducible cytokine expression (e.g., interleukin [IL] 12 or IL-18) to modulate the tumor microenvironment, chemokine receptors to improve tumor homing, or safety switches for considerable control [19]. This generation aims to create relatively versatile and potent CAR T cells that are capable of overcoming immunosuppressive tumor environments.",
        "The emerging fifth-generation CAR T cells represent the cutting edge of this technology. These designs typically include components that can activate constitutive signaling pathways, such as the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, in addition to the other features from earlier generations [20]. For instance, some constructs incorporate a truncated cytokine receptor domain, such as IL-2Rβ, to enhance the proliferation and survival of T cells through STAT3/5 signaling. This approach aims to create CAR T cells with enhanced antitumor efficacy and persistence, potentially expanding their applicability to a relatively broad range of malignancies and autoimmune diseases [21].",
        "Each generation of CAR T cells has been built upon its predecessors and opened new avenues for research and clinical applications. For example, the principles for developing the relatively late-generation CARs are being explored in the context of other immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, for broadening the scope of cellular immunotherapy [22,23].",
        "Currently, anti-CD19 and anti-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR T-cell therapies are authorized for use in patients with hematological malignancies in Europe and the US. The field of hematology has witnessed revolutionary advancements with the approval of several CAR T-cell therapies. These groundbreaking treatments have shown remarkable efficacy in various hematological malignancies, particularly relapsed or refractory B-cell leukemia and lymphomas [16]. The first CAR T-cell therapy to receive FDA approval was tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) in 2017, indicated for treating pediatric and young adult patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia [24]. This was followed by the approval of axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) for use in adult patients with large B-cell lymphoma [25]. Both therapies target CD19, a surface protein expressed on B cells. In 2020, brexucabtagene autoleucel (Tecartus) was approved for treating mantle cell lymphoma, offering a new option for this aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma [26]. The following year, lisocabtagene maraleucel (Breyanzi) was approved for treating large B-cell lymphomas, adding to the armamentarium against these challenging diseases [27]. Recently, idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma) became the first CAR T-cell therapy approved for treating multiple myeloma by targeting BCMA [28]. These approvals mark significant milestones in cancer immunotherapy and are hopeful for patients with limited treatment options. However, although these therapies have shown impressive response rates, they also have potentially serious side effects, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, thereby necessitating careful patient selection and management [29]. The success of CAR T-cell therapy in hematology, particularly its ability to induce deep and durable responses in refractory diseases, has paved the way for exploring its potential in other fields including SARDs [30].",
        "SLE is a prototypic systemic autoimmune disease with a wide range of clinical manifestations including skin rashes, arthritis, nephritis, and neurological involvement [31]. B cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SLE and are characterized by the production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens [32]. The presence of autoantibodies, particularly anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, often precedes the clinical manifestations of SLE, highlighting the central role of B cells in disease initiation and progression [33]. This understanding has led to developing B cell-targeted therapies, with B-cell depletion emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy [34]. B-cell depletion therapy with rituximab failed to meet primary endpoint in randomized controlled trial for SLE, despite some promising observations in case series [35]. Although rituximab has demonstrated effectiveness in some patients, particularly those with refractory disease, its use in SLE remains off-label in many countries owing to mixed results in large clinical trials [36]. Other B-cell-targeting biologics, including belimumab (which targets B-cell activating factor) and obinutuzumab (a second-generation anti-CD20 antibody), have also been studied in SLE with promising results [37,38].",
        "The advent of CAR T-cell therapy has opened new avenues for highly targeted and potentially effective B-cell depletion in SLE. CAR T-cell therapy, which has shown remarkable success in hematological malignancies, is now being explored as a novel treatment approach for severe and refractory SLE. The most common target for CAR T cells in SLE is CD19, a surface protein expressed on B cells from the pro-B-cell stage through memory B cells but absent in long-lived plasma cells [30].",
        "Preclinical studies on CAR T-cell therapy for SLE has provided crucial insights into its potential efficacy and mechanisms of action. CD19-targeted CAR T cells have demonstrated significant promise in murine models of lupus. Anti-CD19 CAR T cells effectively deplete B cells and plasma cells in MRL/lpr mice, leading to a marked reduction in autoantibodies and improvement in kidney function; This study has also reported long-term disease remission and prevention of lupus development in mice [39]. Second-generation CD19 CAR T cells with either CD28 or 4-1BB offer preventive and therapeutic effects in a murine model of SLE [40]. These preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy in SLE and provided valuable insights into optimal targeting strategies and potential mechanisms of action, paving the way for clinical trials in humans.",
        "Early case reports and small case series have provided encouraging results for CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy in patients with SLE. A landmark case report published in 2021 has described a patient with severe refractory SLE who achieved durable remission following treatment with CD19 CAR T cells; the patient experienced rapid and sustained depletion of CD19+ B cells, accompanied by a reduction in anti-dsDNA antibodies and improvement in clinical symptoms [30]. Following this initial report, a small case series of five patients with SLE treated with CD19 CAR T cells has further supported the potential of this approach; four of the five patients showed significant improvement in disease activity, with two achieving drug-free remission at the 12-month follow-up; the treatment was generally well tolerated, with manageable CRS in some patients [41]. These results suggest that CAR T-cell therapy may offer more profound and durable B-cell depletion than do conventional therapies, potentially leading to long-term disease modification in SLE. Several clinical trials (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov) are currently underway to further investigate the safety and efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy in patients with SLE (Table 1). These include a phase I trial of CD19-targeted CAR T cells (NCT03030976) and a study exploring BCMA-targeted CAR T cells in severe and refractory SLE (NCT04550910). Recently, results from a phase 1, single-arm, and open-label clinical trial have been published, focusing on patients of SLE with biopsy-confirmed lupus nephritis treated with BCMA and CD19 dual-targeting CAR T cells; dual-targeting CAR T cells were found to be effective in achieving drug-free remission and led to a significant reduction in SLE autoantibodies (NCT05030779) [42].",
        "These trials aimed to provide highly robust data on the potential of CAR T-cell therapy in SLE and to help define the optimal patient population for this treatment approach.",
        "However, the application of CAR T-cell therapy in SLE is challenging. The therapy is associated with significant potential side effects, including CRS and neurotoxicity, which require careful management [29]. Additionally, the long-term consequences of profound B-cell depletion in patients with SLE, including the risk of infections and potential for the emergence of new autoimmune phenomena, remain to be fully elucidated.",
        "In summary, although CAR T-cell therapy shows promise as a potentially transformative treatment strategy for severe and refractory SLE, further studies are needed to fully understand its long-term efficacy, safety profile, and optimal position in the SLE treatment paradigm. Ongoing clinical trials and accumulating real-world experiences will be crucial for shaping the future role of CAR T-cell therapy in SLE and other autoimmune diseases.",
        "SSc is a complex autoimmune disease, which is characterized by extensive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, vascular abnormalities, and immune dysregulation [43]. The pathogenesis of SSc involves an intricate interplay among fibroblast activation, vascular dysfunction, and aberrant immune responses [44]. Recent studies have shed light on the potential role of B cells in the pathogenesis of SSc. The presence of SSc-specific autoantibodies, such as anti-topoisomerase I and anti-centromere antibodies, often precedes clinical manifestations, highlighting the potential importance of B cells in disease initiation and progression [45]. Further supporting this hypothesis, experimental studies using mouse models of SSc have demonstrated that the removal of B cells can lead to a reduction in fibrosis, a hallmark of the disease [46]. These findings collectively indicate that B cells play important roles in the complex pathophysiology of SSc and open new avenues for therapeutic interventions. Several studies have investigated the efficacy of rituximab in managing various aspects of SSc, including skin fibrosis, lung involvement, and overall disease activity [47]. A systematic review of observational studies and case series has suggested that rituximab may improve skin fibrosis and stabilize lung function in patients with SSc [48]. Despite these promising results, the use of rituximab for treating SSc faces several limitations. The heterogeneity of SSc presentation and variable responses to treatment among patients pose challenges in predicting treatment outcomes. Additionally, the optimal dosing regimen and treatment duration remain unclear, despite studies using different protocols [49,50]. Moreover, the effect of rituximab on specific SSc manifestations, such as digital ulcers and gastrointestinal involvement, is not well-established [51]. Although autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy in severe SSc by surpassing the limitations of conventional treatments, it is associated with considerable transplant-related mortality [52]. Therefore, a therapeutic approach that achieves profound and comprehensive depletion of CD19+ B cells may offer a highly favorable safety profile while potentially maintaining high efficacy. Such an approach could strike a balance between treatment potency and tolerability in managing severe SSc.",
        "The first case report detailing the administration of autologous CD19 CAR T-cell therapy to a patient with SSc was published in 2023 [53]. This landmark publication provides initial insights into the potential application of this innovative therapeutic approach for SSc treatment. According to a subsequently published case series, four patients with SSc treated with CD19 CAR T-cell therapy have shown improved modified Rodnan skin scores and European Scleroderma Trials and Research Group activity indices during a 1-year follow-up with drug-free remission [54]. A recent study has reported the outcomes of allogeneic CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, genetically engineered using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, in two patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc. Remarkably, complete B-cell depletion has been observed in all patients within two weeks post-infusion, and extensive fibrosis in major organs, previously considered irreversible, has shown significant improvement [55]. These clinical studies demonstrate significant improvements in fibrosis and disease activity, and seroconversion of SSc-specific autoantibodies, thereby providing compelling evidence for the potential efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy in SSc.",
        "IIMs are rare autoimmune diseases characterized by muscle inflammation, weakness, and various systemic manifestations. The pathogenesis of IIMs involves a complex interplay among genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and dysregulated immune responses [56]. The presence of myositis-specific and myositis-associated autoantibodies is a hallmark of IIMs and often correlates with distinct clinical phenotypes and disease courses [57]. These autoantibodies, produced by B cells, can be detected in patient sera even before the onset of clinical symptoms, suggesting a potential role of B cells in disease initiation.",
        "Although glucocorticoids in high doses remain the first-line treatment for IIMs, their long-term use is associated with significant adverse effects. Other immunosuppressive agents, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil, are often used as steroid-sparing agents or in refractory cases; however, their efficacy varies [58]. Several studies have investigated the efficacy of B-cell depletion therapies, particularly rituximab, in managing various aspects of IIMs. A large randomized controlled trial has indicated that rituximab in myositis study does not meet its primary endpoint in treating patients with refractory adult and juvenile myositis [59]. Subsequent analyses and case series have suggested that rituximab may be particularly effective in certain subgroups of patients with IIMs, particularly those with anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS) or dermatomyositis [60].",
        "CAR T-cell therapy has shown remarkable success in SLE; however, its application in IIMs is still in the early stages (Table 1). As of 2024, a few pioneering studies have emerged, offering initial insights into the potential of this approach. Two case reports published in 2023 have described the treatment of a patient with refractory ASS using autologous CD19 CAR T cells, resulting in a significant improvement in muscle strength and reduction in muscle enzyme and anti-Jo-1 antibody levels, with a favorable safety profile [61,62]. This was followed by a small case series by Müller et al. [54], which included three patients with severe idiopathic inflammatory myositis treated with CD19 CAR T cells, showing complete remission of clinical manifestations and serological markers. Unlike previous CAR T cells that were derived from autologous sources, a recent case series has demonstrated that allogenic CD19 CAR T cells led complete remission and alleviate muscle damage in a patient with refractory immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy [40].",
        "Although these early findings are encouraging, they also highlight the need for relatively large and controlled studies to fully elucidate the efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes of CAR T-cell therapy in IIMs.",
        "CAR T-cell therapy and mAbs are two innovative approaches for treating SARDs, each with distinct advantages and limitations (Table 2). MAbs offer targeted immunosuppression with a well-established safety profile and are easily administered. Furthermore, mAbs are readily available and have relatively broad applicability at low costs across various autoimmune conditions. However, their effects are often transient and require repeated dosing [63]. In contrast, CAR T cells have the potential for long-lasting remission through persistent immunomodulation, as demonstrated in recent trials of SLE, SSc, and IIMs. A fundamental characteristic distinguishing CAR T-cell therapy from conventional B-cell depleting approaches lies in its superior capacity to achieve deep tissue B-cell depletion. Recent investigations have revealed that CAR T cells possess the unique ability to effectively penetrate and eliminate B cells within secondary lymphoid organs, particularly lymph nodes, in patients with SARDs- a capability not observed with rituximab treatment [64]. This enhanced tissue penetration may explain the profound and durable clinical responses observed in CAR T-cell therapy recipients. Nevertheless, CAR T-cell therapy faces challenges, including the risk of severe CRS, neurotoxicity, and complexity of production [16]. Recent clinical trials on SARDs are advancing towards maximizing the advantages of CAR T cells while minimizing their limitations, with the scope of research now expanding to include diseases such as anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis and IgG4-related disease (Table 1). Furthermore, innovative technologies are being explored for enhancing the efficacy and safety of CAR-based cell therapy for SARDs (Figure 2).",
        "The selection of appropriate targets is crucial for the success and safety of CAR T-cell therapy for SARDs. A promising strategy involves the use of dual-targeting CAR T cells designed to recognize two distinct antigens (e.g., CD19/BCMA and CD19/CD20) of B cells, which potentially improves specificity and reduces the risk of antigen escape [65]. To more selectively target specific autoreactive B cells, chimeric autoantibody receptor (CAAR)-based T-cell therapy has been developed [66]. This approach is expected to reduce toxicity by minimizing the depletion of normal B cells. A phase I clinical trial is currently underway for anti-Muscle-Specific Tyrosine Kinase (MuSK) CAAR-T cell therapy in patients with MuSK-associated myasthenia gravis (NCT05451212). The development of CAAR-T cell therapy is anticipated for other SARDs where disease mechanisms associated with specific autoantibodies are well understood.",
        "Besides conventional T cells, other cellular sources such as γδ T cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells could also be effective therapeutic strategies for CAR-based cell therapy in SARDs (Figure 3). The innate ability of γδ T cells to distinguish healthy and pathogenic tissues may offer improved safety profiles in autoimmune settings [67]. Furthermore, although CAR-T regulatory cells exhibit a short survival period in vivo, they were able to modulate the autoimmunity in a lupus mouse model [68]. Additionally, the innate immune response and cytotoxic effects mediated by NK cells could make CAR-NK cells a promising therapeutic strategy for SARDs [69]. Allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies are being investigated as off-the-shelf options that could ensure immediate availability and reduce production complexities associated with autologous products [70]. Building on this, the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CAR T cells presents an opportunity for relatively standardized and scalable production, thereby potentially addressing manufacturing challenges and reducing variability among batches [71].",
        "While advancing CAR-based cell therapy technology is crucial, it is equally important to carefully select SARDs patients who are most likely to benefit. CAR-based cell therapy may be more effective in patients with active, progressive inflammation driven by excessive B-cell-mediated autoantibody production, rather than those in the advanced stages of tissue damage. Furthermore, as cytotoxic agents such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide are administered as preconditioning regimens for CAR-based cell therapy, careful consideration must be given when deciding on treatment for patients at higher risk of complications, such as the elderly. In this context, further clinical studies are needed to determine the necessity and optimal dosing of preconditioning agents in SARDs [72].",
        "The impact of CAR T-cell therapy on vaccination efficacy, both before and after treatment, represents a critical safety consideration in clinical practice. A recently published study evaluated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients who underwent CAR T-cell therapy, providing valuable insights into this important clinical question [73]. The investigation revealed that patients who received vaccination prior to CAR T-cell therapy demonstrated sustained humoral and cellular responses over an extended period. Also, the study demonstrated that even in patients vaccinated after CAR T-cell therapy, despite the absence of neutralizing antibody production, vaccine effectiveness was maintained through the development of T-cell responses. Based on these findings, there is an urgent need to establish comprehensive vaccination guidelines for the pre- and post-CAR T-cell therapy period, with particular emphasis on infection-related safety considerations.",
        "The integration of CAR T-cell therapy into the treatment paradigm for SARDs requires a multidisciplinary approach involving rheumatologists, immunologists, and experts in cellular therapy. As our understanding of the complex interplay between CAR T cells and the autoimmune environment grows, we may see the emergence of highly personalized approaches, tailoring CAR designs and treatment protocols to individual patient characteristics and disease manifestations.",
        "Despite significant challenges, the potential of CAR T-cell therapy for inducing profound and sustained remission in SARDs warrants further investigation and optimization. Early clinical success, particularly in refractory cases of SLE, SSc, and IIMs, highlights the transformative potential of this approach. As research progresses, the key areas for improvement include enhancing CAR specificity, mitigating adverse events, and identifying target biomarkers. Achieving drug-free remission, long considered elusive in rheumatology, may now be possible thanks to the precise mechanism of action of CAR T-cell therapy. This innovative approach could potentially reset a dysregulated immune system and address the root causes of complex autoimmune conditions. Although various challenges are recognized, the scientific community remains cautiously optimistic. As our understanding deepens, CAR-based cell therapy may offer new hope for patients with severe and refractory autoimmune diseases, and fundamentally transform SARD management, bringing us closer to the goal of long-term and drug-free remission.",

A schematic illustration depicting the key steps in CAR T-cell therapy process and the structure of a CAR. The left figure shows the basic structure of a CAR, consisting of an extracellular domain with variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains, a hinge region, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular signaling domain. The numbered steps illustrate the production and administration process: (1) Leukapheresis is performed to collect the patient’s T cells. (2) The collected T cells are genetically modified using viral vectors to express the CAR. (3) The engineered T cells expressing CAR undergo selection. (4) Selected CAR T cells are expanded ex vivo to achieve therapeutic numbers. (5) The expanded CAR T cells are formulated for infusion.

        "The evolution of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) technology for systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs). This figure illustrates the evolution of CAR technology from its inception in the 1980s to future directions. Early CARs in the 1980~1990s featured a basic design with a CD3ζ signaling domain but limited efficacy. The 2000s saw the introduction of second-generation CARs with costimulatory domains (e.g., CD28 or 4-1BB) to enhance T-cell activation, and third-generation CARs combined multiple costimulatory domains for improved antitumor activity. In the 2010s, fourth-generation CARs incorporated transcriptional activation domains like NFAT to induce cytokine release (e.g., IL-12 or IL-18), while fifth-generation CARs added cytokine receptor signaling pathways (e.g., IL-2Rβ and JAK-STAT) for enhanced functionality. The 2020s brought advanced CAR variants such as CAAR-T cells for pathological B-cell depletion, dual-targeting CARs, CAR-γδ T cells, CAR-NK cells, allogeneic CAR T cells derived from stem cells. Looking ahead, CAR technologies are being explored for SARDs like systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), with innovations targeting diverse immune subsets and enhancing therapeutic efficacy while reducing toxicity.

        "Fundamental principles and new approaches of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-based cell therapy. The figure illustrates the two main approaches to CAR-based cell therapy: autologous and allogeneic. In autologous therapy, immune cells are collected from the patient, while allogeneic therapy utilizes cells from healthy donors. Various immune cell types can be engineered to express CARs, including conventional T cells, regulatory T cells (T Reg cells), natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. Before CAR-cell infusion, patients typically undergo lymphodepletion pretreatment to create a favorable environment for the engineered cells. This comprehensive diagram showcases the versatility of CAR-based therapy platforms and their potential applications in treating systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs).

        "The synovial joint (SJ) facilitates the movement between adjacent bones ensuring a physiological range of motion. The joint cavity contains synovial fluid (SF), an ultrafiltrate of blood plasma that is secreted by the synovial membrane (synovium) which lines the articular capsule. The SF is primarily composed of hyaluronan, lubricin, proteinase, collagenases, and prostaglandins [1]. Hyaline cartilage forms the articular cartilage, which is continuous with the synovial membrane, covering the entire articulating surface of each bone [2]. SJs are comprised of a collection of tissue types enclosed within a sheath and, as such, is considered as being an organ. Like other organs, SJs are targets for various disorders, such as autoimmune diseases, infections, trauma, and, most commonly, degenerative changes such as those found in osteoarthritis (OA) [3]. Inflammatory joint diseases affect the entire synovial joint, with pathological changes observed in joint components, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, synovial fibroblasts, synovial macrophages, adipocytes, tenocytes, ligament fibroblasts and endothelial cells [4], as well as the modified inflammatory milieu of immune cells [5]. SJ disorders, such as OA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), afflict a substantial proportion of the global population, reportedly reaching 7% [6] and 1% [7] worldwide, respectively.",
        "Arthritis is broadly classified into inflammatory and non-inflammatory types, both including a plethora of etiologies [8]. Inflammatory arthritis is comprised of RA, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) [9]. Additional arthritic conditions include mono-arthritis [10], and oligo-arthritis or polyarthritis, depending upon the number of affected joints. Gout and Pseudogout are inflammatory metabolic arthropathies caused by crystal deposits [11]. OA is the most prevalent form of arthritis and a leading cause of chronic pain and long-term disability in the elderly. The health and economic burden of OA is increasing in parallel with the ageing of the global population [12].",
        "Inflammatory arthritis management has substantially improved patients’ quality of life and clinical outcomes [13]. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends starting treatment for newly diagnosed RA patients by means of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) therapy, mostly focusing upon methotrexate (MTX) [14], either alone or in combination with other csDMARDs or glucocorticoids (GCs). If the therapy is not well tolerated or ineffective, EULAR recommends using one of the following biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs): inhibitors of TNF, IL-6 receptor or CD20 antibody, a selective T cell co-stimulation modulator, CTLA-4 Ig, or targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs (Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors) [15]. For PsA patients, EULAR recommends treatment with csDMARDs (MTX) as an initial therapy. bDMARDs that include TNF, IL-17, IL-12/23, IL-23 inhibitors, or targeted therapies, such as phosphodiesterase-4, and JAK inhibitors are indicated if the treatment target had not been achieved [16]. GCs administrated through intra-articular (IA) injections are gold standard treatment for persistent joint inflammation [17].",
        "There are no systemic approved disease-modifying drugs (DMOADs) for OA patients [18]. The most common therapeutic options to treat OA patients' joints are GCs administrated intra-articularly [19]. Joint replacement surgery is considered for severe cases of uncontrollable clinical disease with inadequate response to conservative treatment [13]. There are a few experimental alternative intra-articular (IA) treatment options, such as hyaluronic acid (HA) injections, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and novel cell-based therapeutics [20]. Clinical outcomes with those novel experimental approaches, however, are often inconsistent, with different strengths recommended across guidelines [21].",
        "MSCs are stromal cells that have self-renew abilities and exhibit multi-lineage differentiation. MSCs can be isolated from a variety of tissues, such as the umbilical cord, endometrial polyps, menses blood, bone marrow (BM), or adipose tissue [22]. MSCs derived from multiple sources have been used as cell-based therapy for decades due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties [23, 24]. Studies on MSCs for OA therapy have shown positive clinical outcomes, with improved joint function, pain level, and quality of life. Several clinical MSCs trials conducted on RA patients have also demonstrated some advantages [25, 26]. The largely positive outcomes without severe side effects in clinical trials have established MSCs as promising tools for arthritis therapy. However, further research is required to investigate its applicability in clinical settings [26]. This review will cover current in-vitro and in-vivo models in MSCs research for synovial joint disorder therapy, the results of clinical trials that investigated IA administration of MSCs, and the recent advancements in the potential application of cell-free therapy by means of MSCs-derived extracellular vesicles.",
        "AD-MSCs have gained interest due to their therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine. Their low immunogenicity and their ability to self-renew, to differentiate into various tissue-specific progenitors, to migrate into damaged sites, and to act through autocrine and paracrine pathways have all been shown to be the main mechanisms by which cell repair and regeneration occur [27]. Unlike bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), AD-MSCs can be extracted in large, concentrated quantities (about 500 times more than BM-MSCs) by means of relatively simple procedures and under local anesthesia. Another benefit of AD-MSCs is that they can be extracted from various human body sites [26]. Furthermore, it has been shown that adipose tissue is superior to BM because of its safety and consistent efficacy in improving pain and functional outcomes [28].",
        "Most studies examining the effect of AD-MSCs on joint disorders rely upon in-vitro models in which synovial cells cultured with AD-MSCs are tested, providing information on their reciprocal effect as summarized in Table 1. These models enable the investigation of gene expression, proliferation, secreted proteins, cell populations, and cellular morphology. The different strategies to co-culture AD-MSCs with synovial cells are shown in Fig. 1. AD-MSCs are isolated from adipose tissue, while synovial cells are extracted from SF obtained via arthrocentesis from patients with synovitis (Fig. 1A). Direct and indirect co-cultures allow the investigation of different types of cellular communication, like juxtacrine (Fig. 1B) and paracrine (Fig. 1C) signaling, through the degree of exposure different cell types have on each other. In Fig. 1B and C shown are synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMCs) a cell fraction grown in suspension. Figure 1D shows examination of AD-MSCs conditioned medium (CM) on two synovial cell types: SFMCs (in suspension) and adherent fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS).Table 1Summary of in vitro findings of AD-MSCs in co-culture systemsCulture systemCell sourceEffectRefDirect co-culturePeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and AD-MSCs, previously primed with or without IL-1βAD-MSCs modified CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio[29]AD-MSCs and activated-M1-like macrophages differentiated from PBMCs and digested OA synoviumAD-MSCs responsible for the switching of activated-M1-like inflammatory macrophages to a M2-like phenotype[30]RA patients SF-primed AD-MSCs, CD4+ T cells and monocytes obtained from peripheral blood samplesThe effect of SF on the ability of AD-MSCs to modulate the phenotype of macrophages or T cells was evaluated[31]MSCs line with chondrocytes isolated from OA patients3D co-culture induced suitable conditions for MSC differentiation toward chondrocytes better than 2D standard culture[32]Indirect–transwell co-cultureAD-MSCs in the upper chamber and peripheral blood monocytes (CD14+) in wellThe ability of AD-MSCs to modulate the macrophage phenotype was enhanced after priming with IL-1β[29]AD-MSCs in the upper chamber and activated-M1-like, M2-like macrophages and SF cells in the lower chamberMigration assays were performed to determine if M1-like, M2-like macrophages, and SF cells influenced the migration of AD-MSCs.

        "Giannasi et al. compared the secretome composition of CM collected after 24 h or 72 h from untreated MSCs and from cytokine-primed MSCs with either tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and/or interleukin 1β (IL-1β). The pre-activation of AD-MSCs aimed to mimic the pathological milieu of OA joints in order to target their secretion towards a specific pathological phenotype. Their results indicated that pre-conditioning AD-MSCs with inflammatory cytokines induced cell activation and led to the enrichment of their secretome by several factors with recognized anti-OA effect, including anti-inflammatory, chondroprotective, and analgesic properties [38]. These findings have also been confirmed by Colombini et al.’s group, who demonstrated an enhanced immunomodulatory potential of IL-1β-primed AD-MSCs on macrophages [29]. Another study examined the role of AD-MSCs in switching activated M1-like inflammatory macrophages into M2-like anti-inflammatory phenotype, partially through the PGE2/COX2 pathway, as the authors demonstrated with isolated OA synovial macrophages. This capability supports a specific role of AD-MSCs in the therapeutic resolution of OA synovial inflammation, as well as providing evidence that IFNγ-activated M1-like macrophages represent a good cell model capable of testing AD-MSCs activity [30].",
        "Migration plays an important role in the therapeutic function of stem cells. AD-MSCs can migrate toward tissue injury sites in response to high levels of chemokines [39]. In order to assess such AD-MSCs activity, transwell inserts with large (8 μm) porous were used, allowing cells in the upper chamber to migrate through the pores. The degree of migration of different cells can then be quantified [e.g. chondrocytes [33], B [40] and T cells [41]] with or without AD-MSCs.",
        "Zhang et al. showed that AD-MSCs significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of primary articular chondrocytes when co-cultured together, suggesting that AD-MSCs may act upon endogenous chondrocytes by secreting trophic factors. Co-cultured AD-MSCs also significantly upregulated the expression of articular chondrocyte re-differentiation markers and downregulated the expression of articular chondrocyte de-differentiation markers at the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that AD-MSCs were capable of forming high-quality biomechanical articular cartilage in-vivo [33].",
        "It is important to take into account the effects of synovial cells on AD-MSCs when considering AD-MSCs as a possible therapy for inflammatory synovial disorders. Sayegh et al. demonstrated that the immunomodulatory efficiency of AD-MSCs is highly dependent upon the cytokine/articular microenvironment. AD-MSCs cultured with pro-inflammatory SF of RA patients maintained their proliferation capability and upregulated gene expression involved in immunomodulation through a TNF/NF-κB-dependent mechanism. Their results also showed that AD-MSCs exposed to pro-inflammatory SF were more effective in inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inhibiting pro-inflammatory macrophages compared to control SF obtained from a patient undergoing a trauma-related surgery [31]. Another group co-cultured SF from OA patients with AD-MSCs with the aim of mimicking the joint cavity environment. Their results showed an increase in AD-MSCs viability following SF supplementation as well as changes in several genes involved in cell survival. For example, FOS like 1 (FOSL1), which is involved in the therapeutic effect of AD-MSCs, was upregulated after SF exposure. Those authors suggested that future AD-MSC-based therapy may be further enhanced in an environment that facilitates upregulation of the expression of FOSL1, an AP-1 transcription factor subunit, expression [42]. Wesdorp et al. [43] studied the influence of synovial inflammation on MSCs migration, and whether modulation of inflammation with GCs (triamcinolone acetonide [TAA]) may influence migration. Those authors found that macrophages secrete factors that stimulate MSCs migration, and that modulation with TAA specifically increased the ability of anti-inflammatory macrophages to stimulate MSCs migration. They suggested that modulating inflammation and thereby improving MSCs migration could be a therapeutic approach based upon endogenous repair of cartilage defects.",
        "It has been suggested that the 3-dimensional (3D) spheroid, which is a multicellular aggregate formed under non-adherent 3D in-vitro conditions, may be a useful in-vitro method to better understand MSCs therapy since expression of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and other adhesion proteins as well as immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic genes are upregulated in that cell culture system [44]. AD-MSCs spheroids could therefore emerge as a promising OA treatment, although studying the appropriate methods of administration and considering their interaction with SF is essential. Toward this end, Fuku et al. [45] examined the effect of patient SF on 2D-culture AD-MSCs and spheroid AD-MSCs and observed that SF exhibited a lethal effect on AD-MSCs in 4 patients. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of such an effect of SF on AD-MSCs. Although many positive effects have been attributed to the formation of AD-MSC spheroids, Fuku’s group emphasized that the usefulness of spheroids in OA treatment should be examined in experimental conditions that are more suitable for the joint cavity environment and in a larger number of cases. They recommended that the cytotoxic activity of SF against AD-MSCs administered for therapeutic purposes into the joint cavity should be considered when improving culture methods [45].",
        "It has been shown that AD-MSCs secretum, also known as CM, possesses effects like those observed after transplantation of MSCs [46], containing many cytokines, proteins, growth factors, as well as extra cellular vehicles (EVs) with beneficial effects that can be used in regenerative medicine [47]. For example, one group treated synovium and cartilage explants with MSCs-CM to study the paracrine effect of MSCs secretome. Additionally, they used a co-culture system of synovium and cartilage explants, while preventing direct contact between cartilage and synovium, using filter inserts, creating a more complex and clinically relevant model to test AD-MSCs secretome. Using this culture setting, they found that synovial explants exposed to MSCs-CM expressed less pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL-1β, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and had reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, while upregulating multiple anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic pathways in osteoarthritic cartilage and synovium [36].",
        "EVs comprise a heterogeneous group of vesicles released by various cell types, EVs are released from cells but cannot replicate on their own. EVs can be classified into different subtypes based on their diameter: exosomes (30–100 nm), microvesicles (100–1,000 nm), and apoptotic vesicles (1–5 mm) [48] (Fig. 2A). Several studies have indicated that EVs can transfer their contents to elicit functional responses and mediate signaling through surface receptor contact between cells. EVs contain thousands of different bioactive molecules, including surface proteins, intercellular proteins, amino acids, metabolites, mRNAs, non-coding RNA species, and DNA [49] (Fig. 2B), playing an active role in various processes, such as angiogenesis, antigen presentation, cellular homoeostasis, inflammation, and immunomodulation. EVs derived from various types of MSCs have recently been explored as a novel strategy for cell-free therapy in a variety of diseases, including RA. Based upon current evidence, EV-derived MSCs have been demonstrated to be important MSCs mediators that exert similar functions, and that they can perform the indispensable functions of their parental cells. AD-MSC-derived EVs (AD-MSC-EVs) are thought to function similarly to AD-MSCs.Fig. 2AD-MSCs-derived extra-cellular vesicles (EVs) A Types of EVs; exosomes (30–100 nm), microvesicles (100–1,000 nm), and apoptotic vesicles (1–5 mm) and their mode of secretion into the extracellular space.

        "Although several studies have shown that AD-MSCs could ameliorate RA, the ones that explored the role of AD-MSC-EVs for RA treatment have emerged only recently [49].",
        "Farinazzo et al. showed that AD-MSC-EVs can partially inhibit T cells activation in-vitro, but that this effect was insufficient in-vivo. In addition, AD-MSC-EVs were shown to drive M2 macrophage polarization, thus reducing the ability of macrophages to evoke inflammatory responses. Interestingly, Rossana et al. [50] demonstrated that only the EVs that had been isolated from AD-MSCs pre-activated with IFN-γ and TNF-α induced M2 macrophage polarization. Those authors therefore suggested that the effects of the immunomodulatory AD-MSCs-EVs on macrophages may not be constitutive but rather induced by the inflammatory microenvironment.",
        "The therapeutic ability of MSCs to address OA mainly relates to the secretion of bioactive factors, which can be found within their secreted EVs. Cavallo et al. [51] demonstrated the potential of AD-MSC-derived small EVs (sEVs) by showing their effect on gene expression and protein release of both chondrocytes and synoviocytes by counteracting IL-1β-induced inflammatory effects. The inflammatory environment mediated by NF-κB pathway was significantly attenuated by sEVs. This approach can potentially be used as a new therapeutic strategy for OA therapy. Another group showed that EVs reduced the production of inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, PGE2, and NO in OA chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1β. Treatment also decreased the release of MMP activity and MMP-13 expression, whereas the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the expression of collagen II were significantly enhanced [52].",
        "In a similar model, Tofiño-Vian et al. showed that EVs from AD-MSCs reduced inflammation and oxidative stress, mostly through IL-6 and prostaglandin E2, which may mediate anti-senescence effects in OA osteoblasts, seen by the downregulation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and the reduced accumulation of γH2AX foci [53].",
        "Among the bio-active molecules in AD-MSC-EVs microRNAs (miRNAs), e.g. miR-146a [54], miR-451a [55], miR-93-5p [56], miR-376c-3p [57], have been shown to directly alleviate local inflammation and promote tissue repair. Engineering AD-MSCs, whether by pre-activation or direct transfection, is used as a novel approach for functionalizing AD-MSC-EVs for a more potent immunomodulatory and regenerative effect. Li et al. showed that miR-338-3p overexpressing AD-MSCs exosomes could inhibit chondrocyte inflammation and degradation, as seen by decreased expression of PGE2, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, MMP-3 and MMP-13, as well as by promoting chondrocyte proliferation through targeting RUNX2 [58]. Martinez-Zalbidea et al. transduced an immortalized AD-MSCs line with a CRISPR activation lentivirus system that overexpressed the TSG-6 gene and demonstrated their immunomodulatory potential in IL-1β activated intervertebral disc cells, specifically downregulating IL-8 and COX-2 [59].",
        "Adipose tissue-derived autologous cells are easier to obtain for cell-free therapy in large-scale populations, making adipose tissue a richer and safer source compared to other tissues. Proteomic analyses have shown that AD-MSC-EVs are more closely associated with immunomodulation-related proteins than those from BM-MSC-EVs [60]. In addition, AD-MSC-EVs have been shown to be more effective than BM-MSC-EVs at promoting cartilage and bone regeneration in a mouse model and they represented a superior resource for cell-free therapy [61]. Woo et al. demonstrated that AD-MSC-EVs not only promoted the proliferation and migration of human OA chondrocytes, but that they also maintained the chondrocyte matrix by increasing type II collagen synthesis and decreasing MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5 expression [62].",
        "In-vivo models are necessary for translation of novel treatments to human trials. Understanding the effects of AD-MSCs on synovial cells requires the selection of animal models of various arthritic conditions. Here, we discuss experimental models used to investigate the effects of AD-MSCs on inflammatory arthritis, OA, and metabolic arthritis.",
        "In-vivo experimental animal models of inflammatory RA are used extensively to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms governing inflammation-driven joint damage. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is the RA animal model most commonly used in basic research and drug development studies since it resembles the human RA features of typical synovitis and bone erosion manifestations. BM-MSCs were shown to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro but could not inhibit CIA disease severity [63]. In contrast, MSC-derived EVs ameliorated CIA manifestations via induction of immunomodulatory T lymphocytes [64]. Methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) is another model, and it includes local immunization with a protein antigen (BSA, ovalbumin) followed by IA administration to the affected joints. In contrast to other RA models, AIA occurs only in the injected joints and the immune response is confined to the affected joint where histological features are similar to those of RA [65]. IA administration of MSCs in that model showed reduced inflammation and cartilage damage [66], and MSCs-CM reduced disease severity and immune responses [67].",
        "Proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA) is induced by repeated immunizations with cartilage PG aggrecan in adjuvant, resulting in polyarthritis and subsequent articular cartilage and bone erosion [65]. Swart et al. [68] explored the immunosuppressive effect and mechanism of action of MSCs administrated via intraperitoneal (IP) and IA administration in a PGIA model. MSCs treatment, both via IP and IA, suppressed PGIA. MSCs were largely retained for weeks in the injection site. Those authors showed that MSCs treatment induced a more regulatory phenotype with the production of IL-4 and IL-10, but also of IFN-γ, and a systemic decrease of pathogenic antibodies, thus demonstrating the potential value of MSCs treatment in resistant arthritis.",
        "The K/BxN model and G6PI-induced arthritis are transgenic mice expressing a transgenic T-cell receptor (TcR). These mice develop spontaneous arthritis, which was shown to be B-cell dependent. The transfer of IgG antibodies from arthritic K/BxN mice to naïve mice induced transient arthritis in many different mouse strains. It has been shown that AD-MSCs therapy was unsuitable for modulating the progression of K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis. Based upon the differences in the immune status and monocytic/macrophage balance among the different arthritic models, it was suggested that the identification of cell-specific targets of MSCs will assist in predicting which RA patients will respond positively to MSCs-based therapy [69]. Wang et al. showed that IA administration of AD-MSCs attenuates RA progression by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and mitigating neutrophil infiltration and cartilage erosion, as well as promotes the reconstruction of the CX3CR1+ synovial macrophage barrier in serum-transfer arthritis model mice [70].",
        "The SKG arthritis model was developed using a point mutation in the gene coding for ZAP-70, affecting TcR signaling and eventually leading to an effect upon thymic selection of T cells and, subsequently, autoimmunity. Local transplantation of AD-MSCs and AD-MSC spheroids had a significant therapeutic effect in that model [71]. Another group showed that the administration of AD-MSCs in the SKG arthritis model has a paradoxical effect according to the disease phase during which they were administered, suggesting that the cells act differently depending upon the disease stage [71].",
        "Transgenic mice that overexpress human IL-1α are used to study the role of IL-1 in arthritis. These mice develop spontaneous polyarthritis, synovial proliferation, and cartilage and bone destruction. The cellular composition in joints changed in favor of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and macrophages [72]. Lee et al. [73] investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of BM-MSCs in an IL-1RaKO mouse model. Those authors demonstrated that BM-MSCs inhibited Th17 polarization and thereby reduced inflammation in those mice.",
        "Current animal models for OA can be broadly classified into subtypes, as described by Samvelyan et al. [74], including naturally occurring, genetically modified, surgically induced, chemically induced, and non-invasive models. Spontaneous OA models, such as naturally occurring and genetically modified ones, are commonly used to study primary OA, while invasive models, such as surgically and chemically induced ones, as well as non-invasive models are used to investigate secondary OA. Invasive models are largely used to assess the efficacy of potential OA treatments. Li et al. [75] injected AD-MSCs to rats in an OA model induced by medial meniscectomy of the knee for 8 weeks prior to AD-MSCs injection. AD-MSCs transplantation was accompanied by enhanced cartilage regeneration in those rats. Their study also demonstrated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of labeled AD-MSCs in the injured rat joints 10 weeks after their IA administration. The authors concluded that AD-MSCs persisted locally for 10 weeks in the rat joint, coinciding with the efficacy observed. It is postulated that persistence and/or proliferation of the AD-MSCs in the joint is required to exert their functions in promoting joint regeneration and/or cartilage protection, further supporting the safety and feasibility of IA administration of AD-MSCs for OA treatment [75].",
        "Zhou et al. treated OA rats with IA administration of AD-MSCs, which alleviated OA and inhibited cartilage degeneration by suppressing cartilage apoptotic damage and reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion [76]. In contrast, repeated IA administration of allogeneic BM-MSCs resulted in an adverse clinical response and aggravation of the OA. Although there were no differences in clinical parameters between autologous and allogeneic MSC-treated equines with OA after the first IA administration of these cells, there was an adaptive immune response and aggravation of OA following a second exposure [77].",
        "Mei et al. [78] evaluated the efficacy of IA administrations of culture-expanded allogenic AD-MSCs for the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT)-induced rat OA. Their results supported the protective effect of AD-MSCs on cartilage degeneration, without any notable adverse effects. MHC-unmatched AD-MSCs protected chondrocytes from inflammatory factor-induced damage. Those results revealed that the paracrine effect of AD-MSCs on chondrocytes contributes, at least in part, to the therapeutic effect of AD-MSCs in OA. Similarly, Kuroda et al. [34] found that IA administrated AD-MSCs inhibited cartilage degeneration progression in an ACLT-OA rabbit model. That effect was mediated by AD-MSCs homing to the synovium and by the secretion of factors with chondroprotective effects, such as regulating chondrocyte viability and cartilage matrix protection, specifically thorough inhibiting MMP-13. Cheng et al. used combined IA AD-MSCs and shockwave (SW) therapy in an ACLT OA rat model. The combination therapy had a chondroprotective effect as evidenced by a significantly increased bone volume, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number, as well as a significantly reduced synovitis score compared to the other treatments [79].",
        "The use of uncultured adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) consisting of AD-MSCs as well as M2 macrophages has shown therapeutic potential for OA. Onoi et al. induced OA in immunodeficient rats by destabilization of the medial meniscus and immediately injecting human SVF, AD-MSCs, or saline (control group) into the knees. The SVF group showed significantly slower OA progression and less synovitis, with higher expression of collagen II and SOX9, lower expression of MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5, and a lower M1/M2 ratio in the synovium compared with the AD-MSCs and control groups [80]. Ko et al. [81] used another therapeutic approach consisting of 3D-cultured AD-MSCs. Those authors evaluated the effect of spheroidal AD-MSCs administration on cell survival and arrest the progression of surgically induced OA in a rat model. Their results showed that AD-MSCs spheroids had better in-vitro and in-vivo survival and better chondrogenic potential, and that they exerted greater regenerative effects than AD-MSCs in single-cell suspension, probably by a paracrine mode of action. These findings support the use of stem cell-based therapeutics upon AD-MSCs spheroid forms to treat OA. Similarly, Yoon et al. [82] compared the chondrogenic differentiation capabilities of AD-MSCs in monolayer and culture in 3D suspension bioreactors. Enhanced in vivo cartilage formation was achieved by the transplantation of spheroid-cultured AD-MSCs compared to monolayer-cultured AD-MSCs. The authors attributed this to increased TGF-β3 expression and p38 activation. Their results showed that spheroid culture may be an effective method for large-scale in-vitro chondrogenic differentiation of AD-MSCs and subsequent in-vivo cartilage formation.",
        "Pain is a recurrent symptom in OA and the primary reason for medical intervention. Amodeo et al. [83] explored the efficacy of AD-MSC-CM in controlling pain and neuroinflammation in OA. Their monosodium-iodoacetate (MIA)-induced OA mouse model is largely used to evaluate pain resulting in functional impairment similar to human OA. Those authors demonstrated that AD-MSC-CM exerts a rapid and lasting relief of pain symptoms, probably through modulation of neuroinflammation. They also reported that systemic injection of AD-MSC-CM appears to be the most active route.",
        "Several animal models of hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis have been reported for in-vivo assessment. The injection of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals into various anatomical structures to induce crystal-induced inflammation has been proposed; however, only a few of these models accurately reflect the joint microenvironment in which an acute gouty attack occurs [84]. The pathogenesis of gouty arthritis, characterized by the MSU crystal deposition in the joints associated with acute flares, has been associated with NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and subsequent amplification of the inflammatory response. Medina et al.’s study tested the effect of AD-MSCs administration on the clinical inflammatory response in rabbits after MSU injection. A single dose of AD-MSCs was injected IA shortly after IA administration of MSU crystal. There was both local and systemic inflammatory response resolution in this model. Furthermore, AD-MSCs promoted M2 macrophages in the synovial membrane, inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome, and induced anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 or TGF-β, while decreasing NF-κB activity [85]. The few in-vivo models that have thus far been described in the literature for PsA include three main categories of animal models for PsA: spontaneous/gene mutant types, transgenic types, and induced types [86]. MSCs were not employed for treatment of PsA in those models.",
        "In animal models, Woo et al. showed that IA administration of AD-MSC-EVs significantly attenuated OA progression and protected cartilage from degeneration in two OA models [62]. In addition, MSCs exosomes were shown to reduce pain and repair temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (OA-TMJ) by mounting a well-coordinated response of attenuating inflammation, enhancing proliferation and matrix synthesis, while reducing apoptosis and matrix degradation to achieve overall joint homeostasis and promote TMJ repair and regeneration in an OA-TMJ animal model [87]. Tsujimaru et al. showed that AD-MSC-EVs possess immunosuppressive factors in their vesicles similar to AD-MSCs. They also showed that AD-MSCs and their derived EVs carry IL-1ra that effectively replaces its deficiency in an RA mice model, thereby improving their severe state. This effect has been shown to be comparable to that of anakinra, a recombinant IL-1ra-approved drug for RA management [88]. Wang et al. demonstrated the efficacy of exosomes derived from miR-486-5p overexpressing AD-MSCs in medial menisco-tibial ligament OA rat model. IA administration of miR-486-5p containing exosomes showed a better effect on cartilage preservation (decreased apoptosis, increased Col II and decreased Col X deposition), as well as synovial macrophage preservation (decreasing iNOS and increasing CD163 staining in synovium samples) [89].",
        "Clinical trials for evaluating the effectiveness of AD-MSCs for arthritis therapy in OA have shown promising results. Kim et al. conducted a clinical trial on 49 OA patients (55 knees) with symptoms of knee joint pain and/or functional limitations despite non-surgical treatments for a minimum of 3 months, AD-MSCs were harvested and loaded into a fibrin glue product and then surgically implanted into the lesion site. Clinical assessment scores showed significant improvement among the patients, with 74.5% of them expressing satisfaction with the resultant pain relief [90]. Interestingly, patients over 60 years of age who had lesion sizes > 6.0 cm2 showed less favorable results. Although there were some variations in the results due to these 2 factors, the overall clinical outcomes of MSC implantation in OA patients were encouraging.",
        "Pers et al. [91] reported their phase I, prospective, bicentric, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalating clinical trial of AD-MSCs therapy in 18 OA patients who were injected IA. Despite the limited number of patients and the absence of a placebo arm, the authors were able to demonstrate the safety and promising treatment potential of AD-MSCs. Freitag et al. [92] conducted a randomized trial on 30 OA patients in whom AD-MSCs were extracted from their adipose tissues and cultured until passage 2 prior to injection. Autologous AD-MSCs were then IA administered in a single injection (group 1) or in 2 injections (group 2), while the control patients received conservative management (group 3). The AD-MSCs-treated groups showed clinically significant improvement in pain reduction and function. Magnetic resonance imaging analyses showed that 37% of the participants in the first treatment group exhibited further cartilage loss compared to the control. However, ~ 89% of the patients in the second treatment group showed marked improvement or no progression in cartilage loss. Furthermore, no serious adverse events were observed in the 2 treated groups during follow-up. The authors concluded that AD-MSCs therapy is a safe and effective treatment for OA and that frequent injections are preferable.",
        "Lee et al. conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 24 patients with knee OA aged 18–75 years who had a mean pain intensity (VAS score) of 4 or higher for a minimum of 12 weeks with at least 1 grade 3–4 lesion. The patients were randomly divided into those treated with IA AD-MSCs administration and a control group administrated with saline. The AD-MSC-treated group showed significant reductions in knee pain. Their physical and radiological examination data showed that they demonstrated a wider range of knee motion and unchanged cartilage defects, in contrast to the enlargement of defects seen in the control group. It was concluded that IA administrations of autologous AD-MSCs provided satisfactory functional improvement and pain relief for OA patients, and did so without causing short-term adverse events [26, 93]. In another study evaluating the safety and therapeutic potential of autologous AD-MSCs in OA patients, 18 OA patients were enrolled and divided into three dose groups. Clinical and radiological parameters were evaluated during 96 weeks of follow-up. The high-dose AD-MSCs group exhibited better pain relief and greater improvement in knee function compared to the other 2 groups [94].",
        "Several studies have indicated that the inhibitory effect of AD-MSCs is affected by the stage of OA at which they are administered, favoring early-stage intervention with little to no effect in the late stage of the disease [95–97]. In addition, swelling of the injected joints is frequently observed and is thought to be associated with the survival rate of the AD-MSCs. Directly injected cells usually have limited cell retention and survival rates, especially in large cartilage lesions. Koh et al. reported that AD-MSCs seeded in scaffolds may have better viability, preservation, and aggregation. Those authors recommended that appropriate cell-loaded scaffolds should be developed for treating patients with large cartilage defects in order to improve the efficacy of this procedure, as well as the level of comfort of the patients [97].",
        "Compared to OA, relatively few trials have been performed with MSCs in RA. In some cases, MSCs therapy may not be suitable for RA, given the growing armamentarium of other efficient therapeutics available as opposed to OA. Although there have been a limited number of clinical trials of MSCs, especially AD-MSCs for RA therapy, the therapeutic safety and efficacy have been confirmed in several studies [26]. Vij et al. conducted a phase I/IIa non-randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single, intravenous infusion of autologous AD-MSCs over a period of 52 weeks in RA patients. The results indicated that it was safe and efficacious for the improvement of joint function in those patients [98]. In a multicenter, dose escalation, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled phase Ib/IIa clinical trial of 53 patients, Álvaro-Gracia et al. demonstrated that intravenous infusion of culture-expanded AD-MSCs was generally well tolerated and free of side effects at the dose range and time frame studied [99]. In their double-blind, ascending dose, Phase I/IIa randomized controlled trial, Freitag et al. sought to assess the safety and efficacy of an allogeneic AD-MSCs preparation (MAG200) in the treatment of knee OA over 12 months. Their results showed a reproducible and statistically significant effect over placebo, which was clinically relevant for pain in the 10 ​ × ​106 dose cohort and for function in the 20 ​ × ​106 and 100 ​ × ​106 dose cohorts. Furthermore, a trend in disease-modification was observed, with improvement in total knee cartilage volume in MAG200 10, 20, and 100 ​ × ​106 dose cohorts, but with progression of the OA in placebo group, though this was not statistically significant [100].",
        "Chen et al. evaluated the safety and efficacy of IA administration of allogeneic AD-MSCs (ELIXCYTE®) for OA knee among 57 subjects in a patient-blind, randomized, active-control trial consisting of 4 arms that consisted of a hyaluronic acid control and 3 ELIXCYTE® doses. The results showed a significantly reduced pain score at week 24 between the post-treatment visit and baseline in all ELIXCYTE® groups. Compared to HA group, those groups revealed significant decreases at week 4 in total pain scores, stiffness scores, and functional limitation scores, suggesting the potential benefit of ELIXCYTE® in earlier onset cases [101]. Similarly, Kuah et al. investigated Progenza (PRG) in-vitro expanded AD-MSCs with cell culture supernatant as potential disease-modifying treatment options for OA. Their single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study showed significant within-group improvement in pain scores from baseline at all-time points for the PRG group, with highly significant improvements seen at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 compared to the marginal improvement in the placebo group [102]. Although its safety has been extensively demonstrated, it is important to note that allogenic AD-MSCs IA administrations might have serious consequences in certain conditions. For example, Hosono et al. reported the development of severe arthritis caused by multiple IA administration with AD-MSCs for knee OA. A total of 113 patients received AD-MSCs treatment, and 75% (85/113) of them received an AD-MSCs injection at least twice with a 6-month interval. Although no obvious negative sequelae were observed in any patient after the first treatment, 53% (45/85) of the patients who received their second or third AD-MSCs injections sustained severe knee arthritis. In terms of pathophysiology, Hosono et al. found anti-histone H2B Ab in SF samples from patients who exhibited severe arthritis following the second AD-MSCs treatment [103]. Although more research is needed to determine the duration of the therapeutic effects, the optimal dosing, and the administration strategy, as well as recipient patient profiles for treatment candidates, AD-MSCs are considered to be low-risk and suitable for treatment. The source of AD-MSCs, whether autologous (derived from the patient) [90–95, 98] or allogenic (donor-derived) [99–104], as well as additional donor characteristics (Fig. 3A), should also be addressed in future research and therapeutic decisions.Fig. 3Standardization of AD-MSCs and AD-MSC-derived therapies may promote the translation into clinical practice A Identification of suitable donor candidates for AD-MSCs source isolation, being syngeneic or allogeneic transplantation, maximizing treatment potency. B Production and processing of a variety of AD-MSCs and AD-MSC-derived therapies insuring both quality and safety. C Stem cell-based therapy can be translated to clinical practice and potentially become an off-the-shelf treatment for the wide population",

        "Finally, MSCs and their derived products have immunomodulatory, chondro- and osteo-protective potential via functional changes of T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and synovial cells that help restore the synovial hemostasis, as shown in the graphical abstract. Many pathways relating to the pathogenesis of arthritis have been shown to be affected by AD-MSCs. Table 2. summarizes the underlying mechanisms of AD-MSC-mediated immunomodulation and tissue regenerative abilities across experimental models. AD-MSCs treatment has consistently been shown to reduce the levels of IL-1β and TNFα, key cytokines involved in the inflammatory response and the development of structural bone and cartilage damage in arthritis. In contrast, IL-10 and TGF-β, key regulators of immune homeostasis, are consistently increased by AD-MSCs treatment. These findings coincide with phenotypic changes from inflammatory T-cells to Tregs and from M1-macrophages to M2-macrophages.Table 2Summary of the effects of AD-MSC effects on disease-associated inflammatory cells/cytokines across arthritis modelsAD-MSCs treatment typeModelResultsReferenceT-cellsIn-vitroAD-MSCs CMRA human PBMCs↑ TGF-β, ↑ Tregs, ↓ Th17, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-17, ↓ IL-21[105]Allogeneic AD-MSCsCollagen-reactive RA human T cells; direct and transwell co-cultures↓ IFNγ, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-17, ↑ IL-10, ↑ Tregs[106]SF primed AD-MSCsActivated CD4+ T cells; direct co-culture↑ Tregs, ↓ Th1[31]AD-MSCsCD3+ T cells from CIA mouse lymph node↓ IFNγ, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-2, ↑ IL-10, ↑ TGF-β[107]AD-MSCsCon A-stimulated murine splenocytes and human PBMCs; direct co-culture↓ T-cell proliferation[108]In-vivoHuman AD-MSCs, allogeneic and syngeneic murine AD-MSCsCIA mice; intraperitoneal injection↓ Sera IgG, ↓ RANTES, ↓ Th1/Th17, ↓ IFNγ, ↓ TNFα, ↑ IL-10, ↑ Tregs[107]AD-MSCsCIA mice; Intravenous injection↓ GM-CSF+CD4+ T cells (in spleen and peripheral blood but not in the draining lymph nodes), ↑ Tregs, Tr1, and LAG-3+Tr1 cells (in the draining lymph nodes)[109]AD-MSCsSKG mice; intraperitoneal injectionCon-A stimulated splenocytes; ↓ IL-17, ↓ IL-6, ↑ IL-10, ↑ TGF-β[108]Clinical trialAD-MSCsPhase Ib/IIa clinical trialDistribution of T-cell populations, including Tregs in circulation, was not significantly modified among cohorts[99]Monocytes/MacrophagesIn vitroIL-1β primed Allogeneic AD-MSCsCollagen-reactive RA human monocytes/macrophages; direct and transwell co-cultures↑ IL-10[106]IL-1β primed AD-MSCsLPS\\IFN-γ activated CD14+ monocytes from healthy donors; transwell co-culture↑ CD206, ↑ M2-macrophages[29]AD-MSCsIFN-γ activated CD14+ monocytes from healthy donors; transwell co-culture↓ M1-macrophages (↓ IL-1β, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ MIP1α/CCL3, ↓ S100A8, ↓ S100A9), ↑ M2-macrophages (↑ IL-10, ↑ CD163, ↑ CD206, ↑ PGE2[30]SF primed AD-MSCsLPS\\IFN-γ activated CD14 + monocytes; direct co-culture↓ CD40, ↓ CD80[31]AD-MSCs and AD-MSC spheroidsPMA-differentiated, LPS activated THP-1 cells; co-culture↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6[71]Murine inguinal fat AD-MSCsCX3CR1+ synovial lining macrophages from healthy mice; direct and transwell co-culturesTranscriptome related to leukocyte cell–cell adhesion, migration, and regulation of immune effector were significantly enriched and upregulated, e.g. M2 polarization; ↑ Rac2, ↑ CCL2, enhanced barrier function in CX3CR1+ macrophages; ↑ Tjp1, ↑ F11r[70]In-vivoAD-MSCs and AD-MSC spheroidsSKG mice; IA administration↓ Macrophage infiltration[71]Murine inguinal fat AD-MSCsK/BxN serum-transfer arthritis mice; IA administrationSynovium; ↓ IL-1β, ↓ TNFα, ↑ CX3CR1+ macrophagesPeripheral blood; ↑ IL-10, ↓ IL-6, ↓ IL-1β[70]Synovial cellsIn vitroAllogeneic AD-MSCsLPS\\TNFα stimulated RA human FLS; direct and transwell co-cultures↓ TNFα, ↓ PGE2, ↓ collagenase activity, ↓ gelatinase activity[106]AD-MSCsCollagen-reactive CIA mice synovial cells; direct and transwell co-cultures↓ IL-1β, ↓ TNFα, ↓ MIP2, ↓ INFγ, ↓ IL-12, ↓ RANTES, ↑ IL-10, ↓ IL-17, ↓ IL-2, ↑ TGFβ[107]AD-MSCs from infrapatellar Hoffa fat, SC hip fat, and SC abdominal fatchondrocytes and synoviocytes; transwell co-cultures↓ IL-1β, ↓ IL-6, ↓ CXCL8/IL-8, ↓ COX2, ↑ PGE2[110]AD-MSC-EVs and CMIL-1β activated OA chondrocytes and cartilage explants↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ PGE2, ↓ NO, ↓ COX2, ↓ MMP activity, ↓ MMP-13, ↑ IL-10, ↑ collagen II[52]AD-MSC-EVs and CMIL-1β activated OA Osteoblasts↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ PGE2, ↑ IL-10, ↓ mitochondrial oxidative stress, ↓ accumulation of γH2AX foci[53]AD-MSC and AD-MSC spheroidsRA synovial fibroblasts; transwell co-cultures↓ Migration, ↓ proliferation[71]infrapatellar fat pad AD-MSCIL‐1β activated OA articular cartilage cells↑ COL2A1, ↑ Aggrecan, ↑ SOX9, ↓ MMP‐13, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ IL-1β, ↓ ROS[111]In-vivoinfrapatellar fat pad AD-MSCSprague–Dawley rats OA; IA administrationIn synovial fluid; ↓ ROS, ↓ IL-6, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-1β[111]Autologous AD-MSC and SVFSheep transected meniscus; IA administrationCondyle Immunohistochemistry; ↑ COLL2, ↓ COLL1, ↓ IL-1β, ↓ MMP13Synovial Fluid; ↓ IL-1β, ↓ CTX2, ↓ TNFα, ↓ IL-6, ↓ PGE2[112]AD-MSC derived exosomesMIA-induced rat OA model; IA administrationcartilage tissues and rat synovial tissues; ↓ β-catenin, ↓ WNT3, ↓ WNT9, ↑ COL2[57]",

        "Also of note is the wide range of AD-MSCs treatment types, including different adipose tissue sources, culture methods, priming and processing approaches (Table 2), demonstrating both the need for further research for optimizing the therapeutic effect of AD-MSCs, as well as the need for standardization prior to clinical translation (Fig. 3B).",
        "AD-MSCs therapy for inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint disorders generally exhibited positive outcomes across research platforms, including in-vitro and in-vivo animal studies as well as in human clinical trials. However, despite its immense potential, only a few MSC-based therapies have been approved. It is vital for research groups to choose the appropriate models, both in-vitro and in-vivo, understand their limitations, and work to maximize their translatability. While significant progress has been made, additional research is needed to optimize AD-MSCs and AD-MSC-derived EV treatment strategies for joint disorders. Figure 3 shows the potential of future studies investigating AD-MSCs and their derivatives products towards clinical therapeutic use. The research needs to include platforms for evaluating the safety, optimal dosing, administration routes as well as profiles of patients who are candidates for such treatment (Fig. 3A). Standardizing the method of culturing, isolating and processing AD-MSC-derived treatments (Fig. 3B), could lead to their use in clinical application for standard arthritis care (Fig. 3C).",
        "Additionally, further insights into the immunomodulatory mechanisms of AD-MSCs and AD-MSC-derived EVs in synovial joint disorders are necessary for successful translation into clinical practice. Overall, while AD-MSC-based therapies show promise for the treatment of joint disorders, further research is essential to realize their full therapeutic potential.",

        "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease and a frequent cause of pain, functional loss, and disability. It often becomes chronic, and conventional treatments have demonstrated only modest clinical benefits, with no lesion reversal [1]. Cell-based therapies with both autologous and allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have shown encouraging results in human case reports [2–5]. We have been involved recently in two pilot clinical trials with autologous expanded bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) where the patients were treated with one single intra-articular injection of cells [2, 3, 5, 6]. The trials showed feasibility, safety, strong indications of potential clinical efficacy and objective improvement of cartilage quality demonstrated by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 mapping [2, 3]. In addition, the healing effects seemed to remain for at least 2–4 years after cell treatment [3, 6, 7]. In the present commentary we have performed a more sophisticated analysis using the Huskisson plot [8], which permits quantification of the healing efficacy, in order to compare the different conditions tested (e.g. number of cells) and the endurance of the single shot treatments performed.",
        "The former assay (EudraCT 2009-017405-11; NCT01183728) [2] was performed using a single dose of 40 million autologous BM-MSCs per knee. Feasibility and safety were confirmed and patients exhibited a rapid and progressive improvement of algo-functional indexes (Visual Analog Scale, VAS, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, WOMAC) that amounted 65% to 78% by 1 year, and the amelioration was maintained at the end of the second year [3]. In addition, MRI T2 relaxation measurements demonstrated a significant improvement of cartilage quality.",
        "In the more recent similar trial (Eudra CT 2009-017624-72, NCT02123368) [5, 6] one single dose containing either 10 or 100 million autologous BM-MSCs per knee was used, and compared to controls with no cells. There was no safety issues and the efficacy results were alike with both doses, and at 1 and at 4 years (Fig. 1). However, the baseline values in control and test arms were somewhat inhomogeneous (compare the three red bars in Fig. 1), and this could impair the scrutiny. (Fig. 1). However, the baseline values in control and test arms were somewhat inhomogeneous (compare the three red bars in Fig. 1), and thisFig. 1Effects of BM-MSC treatment on pain (A, estimated from VAS) and disability (B, estimated from WOMAC, general index), both quantified as % of the maximum.

        "A more sophisticated analysis of pain and disability can be performed through Huskisson plots [8]. In this analysis, all the patients are represented (instead of only the mean values, as in Fig. 1), and the improvements to their pain or disability are plotted against their baseline pain or disability score. The Huskisson plot leverages the weights of different baseline values, which otherwise have more or less influence depending on the baseline position within the plot. The result is a regression line where the slope represents a measure of the efficacy of the treatment. A slope of 1 (i.e., the line at 45º in Fig. 2) represents complete (100%) pain relief, the ‘perfect treatment’; conversely, the horizontal line (i.e., slope of 0) represents no healing effect of the treatment at all.Fig. 2Estimation of the efficacy of the different OA treatments from the Huskisson plot.

The slopes of the placebo plots ranged between -0.12 and 0.26, and were not significantly different from zero in all the four cases (see Figure legend for details).",
        "The cell treatments with the 10 and the 100 million cell doses improved the algo-functional indexes, but did not differ very much between them. VAS slopes were 0.79 (Fig. 2C) and 0.73 (Fig. 2E), respectively at 1 year, and 0.49 (Fig. 2C) and 0.46 (Fig. 2E) at 4 years. For WOMAC, slopes were 0.55 and 0.32 at 1 year, and 0.52 and 0.53 at 4 years (Fig. 2D and F). The slopes obtained in the Huskisson plot may also be used for comparison among different trials. It should be remarked that the slopes representing the efficacies of healing of treatments with a dose of 40 million cells was 0.65 to 0.78 after 1 year and 0.71 after 2 years [2, 3], so that the values obtained in the different trials were quite comparable.",
        "In conclusion, the results of the two studies reanalysed and reviewed here demonstrate that, although the presence of the injected BM-MSCs is ephemeral [9], the beneficial effects on knee OA remain for at least 4 years [6]. The healing action seems quite similar for 10, 40 or 100 million cells doses. This unexpected result may arise from saturation of the healing effect and/or from cell damage during transport by oxygen and substrate starvation at the high cell densities used. We have preliminary results that suggest a decrease of cell viability during long storage periods at high density, even at 4 ºC. Long lasting effects of MSC treatments have been attributed to epigenetic actions [9, 10], and this mechanism could explain our results. These observations are of great practical importance as they permit to accomplish cell application with one single cell treatment, which is cheaper and more straightforward than multi-application, and does possible the administration of the cell treatment to a larger number of patients. In this regard, we have adopted this strategy in the design of a new phase III randomized clinical trial in this setting (ARTROCELL trial, with clinicaltrials.gov identifier code NCT05086939) that is currently recruiting patients.",

    "title": "Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. complex and difficult. Even after the administration of new biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), only a few patients achieve the complete remission phase. DMARDs help only in modifying the disease activity, which sooner or later fails. They do not manage the disease at the patho-etiological level. There are some serious side effects as well as drug interaction with DMARDs. There are few subsets of RA patients who do not respond to DMARDs, reasons unknown. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide a promising alternative, especially in such cases. This review elaborates on the studies pertaining to the application of MSCs in rheumatoid arthritis over the last two decades. A total of 14 studies (one review article) including 447 patients were included in the study. Most of the studies administered MSCs in refractory RA patients through the intravenous route with varied dosages and frequency of administration. MSCs help in RA treatment via various mechanisms including paracrine effects. All the studies depicted a better clinical outcome with minimal adverse events. The functional scores including the VAS scores improved significantly in all studies irrespective of dosage and source of MSCs. The majority of the studies depicted no complications. Although the use of MSCs in RA is still in the early stages requiring further refinement in the source of MSCs, dosage, and frequency. The role of MSCs in the management of RA has a promising prospect. MSCs target the RA at the molecular level and has the potential to manage refractory RA cases not responding to conventional treatment. Multicentric, large sample populations, and long-term studies are required to ascertain efficacy and safety.

      "title": "MSC–microvesicles protect cartilage from degradation in early rheumatoid arthritis via immunoregulation",
      "abstract": "Objective As research into preclinical rheumatoid arthritis (pre-RA) has advanced, a growing body of evidence suggests that abnormalities in RA-affected joint cartilage precede the onset of arthritis. Thus, early prevention and treatment strategies are imperative. In this study, we aimed to explore the protective effects of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived microvesicles (MVs) on cartilage degradation in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Methods A CIA mouse model was established to observe early pathological changes in cartilage (days 21-25) through histological and radiological examinations. On day 22, MSCs-MVs were intravenously injected into the mice with CIA. Radiological, histological, and flow cytometric examinations were conducted to observe inflammation and cartilage changes in these mice compared to the mice with CIA and the control mice. In vitro, chondrocytes were cultured with inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and TNFα to simulate inflammatory damage to cartilage. After the addition of MVs, changes in inflammatory levels and collagen expression were measured via Western blotting, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and quantitative PCR to determine the role of MVs in maintaining chondrocytes. Results MSC–MVs expressed vesicular membrane proteins (CD63 and Annexin V) and surface markers characteristic of MSCs (CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105). In the early stages of CIA in mice, a notable decrease in collagen content was observed in the joint cartilage. In mice with CIA, injection of MSCs-MVs resulted in a significant reduction in the peripheral blood levels of IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6, along with a decrease in the ratio of proinflammatory T and B cells. Additionally, MSC-MVs downregulated the expression of IL-1β, TNFα, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5 in cartilage while maintaining the stability of type I and type II collagen. These MVs also attenuated the destruction of cartilage, which was evident on imaging. In vitro experiments demonstrated that MSC-MVs effectively suppressed the secretion of the inflammatory factors IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Conclusions MSCs-MVs can inhibit the decomposition of the inflammation-induced cartilage matrix by regulating immune cell inflammatory factors to attenuate cartilage destruction. MSC-MVs are promising effective treatments for the early stages of RA.

        "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an erosive, symmetrical, immune-mediated polyarthritis of unknown etiology [1, 2]. The primary pathogenic process involves the disruption of immune tolerance, leading to the activation of immune cells and the production of autoantibodies, which subsequently result in damage to the joints and other body systems. RA affects approximately 18 million people worldwide [3]. In 2012, the concepts of early RA and preclinical RA (pre-RA) were introduced by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [4–6]. Research on early and pre-RA showed that earlier treatment significantly improves patient outcomes. As a result, research on early or pre-RA is increasingly becoming a prominent area of interest in both clinical and basic research [7, 8].",
        "Pre-RA can be divided into several stages. The at-risk stage is characterized by environmental factors (e.g., smoking and obesity) as well as genetic factors (e.g., MHC II and HLA-DR) contributing to the potential risk for RA development. Next, in the presymptomatic RA stage, autoimmunity is activated, leading to the production of autoantibodies [e.g., anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA), anti-collagen type II (anti-CII), and rheumatoid factor (RF)]. However, the patient remains asymptomatic, as arthritis has yet to develop. Finally, the activation of immune cells (T and B lymphocytes and neutrophils) results in proteoglycan depletion, cartilage destabilization, and the activation of synovial cells [9, 10]. This stage is also known as the critical “window period” for RA treatment.",
        "Individuals who test positive for ACPAs are believed to have a 98% probability of developing RA within 2-10 years [11–14]. In individuals positive for ACPAs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown that bone and cartilage inflammation occurs earlier than synovitis [15, 16]. Histological analysis of synovial tissue from ACPA-positive individuals in the pre-RA stage also revealed no notable abnormalities [17]. Clinically, bone and joint pain tend to manifest earlier in ACPA-positive individuals. Furthermore, MRI scans of ACPA-positive individuals experiencing joint pain but without arthritis distinctly indicated localized subclinical inflammation [18]. In these patients, while synovial hyperplasia was absent, inflammation in the cartilage and bone was still detectable [19, 20]. Therefore, in the management of pre-RA, maintaining cartilage homeostasis is crucial and takes precedence over the concerns typically associated with late-stage chronic arthritis.",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gained widespread attention in the field of cell therapy [21] and have been used to treat rheumatic diseases, including RA [22]. Recent research has particularly explored the paracrine effects of MSCs [23–25], highlighting the roles of extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes (exos) and microvesicles (MVs), which can partially or completely mimic the functions of their originating cells [26]. MVs have effects similar to those of MSCs in terms of immunomodulation, alleviation of degenerative conditions, and maintenance of cartilage homeostasis [27]. However, the mechanism by which MSC-MVs protect cartilage in early RA is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of MVs on early collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).",
        "Human chondrocyte CP-H096 (Pricella, China), C28/I2 (Sigma, USA), and mouse chondrocyte CP-M087 cells (Pricella, China) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco, 11960044) supplemented with 100 μg/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, 15140122), 2 mmol/mL glutamine (Gibco, 25030081), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, 10099-141C).

        "MSCs originating from 2 healthy human donors (No. 2020509, 2020510) were sourced from the Chengdu Stem Cell Biobank. Prior to and upon storage, the MSCs underwent comprehensive analyses, including endotoxin testing (detection number: JK-ZK-SR-005). The MSCs were cultivated in proliferative medium composed of α-MEM (Gibco, C12571500BT), 100 µg/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mol/mL glutamine and supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were passaged upon reaching 80–90% confluence. The MSCs used in the experiments were from passages 5 to 7. All the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Surface marker analysis of MSCs (PE CD44, FITC CD90, PerCP-Cy™5.5 CD105, and APC CD73) was performed via flow cytometry following the manufacturer’s instructions (BD Stemflow™, AB_2869404).

For immunohistochemistry, tissue sections were immersed in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0) and subjected to heat retrieval for 20 min in a 100 °C water bath to facilitate antigen retrieval. The slices were then permeabilized and blocked in PBS-T (0.03% Triton X-100) containing 1% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. The tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, IL-17, ADAMTS-5, MMP-13, CI, CII, and aggrecan (ABclonal, China), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Normal rabbit IgG (ABclonal, China) was used as a histological control. Immunohistochemical staining was visualized via DAB (Zhongshan Biotech, Beijing, China, #ZLI-9032). Images were analyzed via Halo AI and QuPath.",
        "For cell proliferation assays (CCK-8 assays), the cells were seeded in a 96-well plate. The cells were treated as indicated. CCK-8 reagent was added, and the samples were incubated. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm. For cell migration assays (scratch assay), a scratch was created in a confluent monolayer. The cells were treated as indicated. The scratch closure was observed over time. Then, the migratory distance was determined. For cell apoptosis analysis (flow cytometry), cells were treated with the test compounds. Then, the samples were stained with Annexin V and PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. The number of apoptotic and necrotic cells was quantified on the basis of the staining patterns.",
        "For RNA extraction, TRIzol was used to lyse the cells. The mixture was allowed to stand for 15 min to lyse the cells, 200 μL of chloroform was added, the mixture was vortexed for 15 s, and the mixture was allowed to stand for 3 min. The mixture was subsequently centrifuged at 4 °C at 13,000 r/min for 15 min, the supernatant was aspirated into a new EP tube without RNA, an equal volume of isopropanol was added, the mixture was gently inverted and mixed, and the mixture was allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature. After 10 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 r/min, and the supernatant was discarded. After another 10 min, the mixture was again centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 r/min, the supernatant was discarded and the mixture was placed on the ventilating table to dry until the RNA became transparent. A total of 20 μL of DEPC water was added to dissolve the RNA sample. For data analysis, after the raw data for sequencing (raw data) were obtained, the raw data were first filtered to obtain high-quality sequencing data (clean data), and the sequencing data (clean data) were compared with the reference genome of the project species to obtain comprehensive transcript information and perform gene expression quantification, as well as Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis.",
        "In this study, the data are expressed as the means ± SDs or percentages. Statistical values for the in vitro experiments were derived from at least 3 independent experiments. Comparisons between two groups were conducted via a 2-tailed Student’s t test, whereas comparisons involving three or more groups were performed via one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc comparisons. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All the statistical analyses were conducted via GraphPad Prism 9 software (San Diego, California, USA).",
        "Fourth-generation MSCs were obtained from a biological cell bank (Fig. 1a). Upon passaging, the cells were assessed for their stem cell characteristics, including morphology (Fig. 1b); the surface markers CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105 (Fig. 1c); and trilineage differentiation potential (Fig. 1d). The cells from the fifth generation were cultured initially in FBS-containing medium for 48 h, followed by a subsequent 48-h culture in FBS-free medium. Using the method illustrated in Fig. 1e, we isolated MVs from the culture medium. Nanotracking and TEM analyses confirmed that the size range of the majority of the particles was 100–1000 nm, indicating a vesicular structure (Fig. 1f, g). Membrane marker profiling revealed the expression of the MSC markers CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105 on MVs (Fig. 1i). Additionally, Western blotting revealed the presence of the extracellular vesicle markers CD63 and Annexin V in the MVs (Fig. 1h). These results indicate that the method outlined in the schematic diagram successfully isolated the MVs required for subsequent experiments. In vivo studies involved the intravenous injection of 108/100 µL of MVs into DBA/1J mice twice a week for 3 consecutive months to assess the safety of MVs as therapeutic agents (Fig. S1a). Throughout the 3-month in vivo study period, no mortality was observed in the mice injected with MVs (Fig. S1b), and no apparent adverse effects were noted. Dissection of major organs revealed no pathological abnormalities (Fig. S1c). Metabolic tracing revealed that MVs can be transported intravenously to cartilage, major organs (with clustering observed in the red pulp of the spleen), and throughout the body within 1 h and are metabolized within 7 days. Toxicity assessments revealed that MVs could enter chondrocytes (Fig. S1d, e) without inducing cellular abnormalities; CCK-8 assays revealed no cellular toxicity (Fig. S1f, g). These findings collectively support the safety profile of MVs as therapeutic agents.Fig. 1Acquisition and identification of MSCs and MVs. a Acquisition and quality control (QC) of MSCs were performed with the Chengdu Stem Cell Biobank. b Morphology of MSCs in media supplemented with FBS and serum starved for 48 h. c MSC membrane markers (CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105) were identified via flow cytometry. d The osteogenic (Alizarin red), adipogenic (Oil red O), and chondrogenic (Alcian blue) differentiation potential of MSCs. e An experimental protocol for the isolation of MVs via differential ultracentrifugation was implemented. f The size and number of MVs were measured via ZetaView. f Size and shape were analyzed via TEM. h Protein identification of MVs (CD63 and Annexin V) was performed via Western blotting. i Membrane markers of MVs (CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105) were identified via flow cytometry",

        "On day 0 and day 21, the mice received 2 doses of CFA with CII CAS (Fig. 2a). By day 25, a subset of the mice had developed arthritis, with a significant increase in the number of inflamed joints and CIA scores compared with those of the control group (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2b–d). CT images revealed thinning of the articular cartilage and a decrease in trabecular bone (Fig. 2e). Histopathological analysis of H&E-stained sections revealed that at 21 and 23 days, compared with those in the control group, the mice in the experimental group presented receding cartilage tide lines and no notable synovial hyperplasia. However, by day 25, the mice showed no major joint destruction but an increased presence of synovial membranes. Concurrently, there was a decrease in the cartilage area (P < 0.01) and an increase in the joint destruction score (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2f). An evaluation of red-solid green staining revealed that the cartilage tide line receded, red collagen levels decreased, and notable changes occurred in the cartilage of the mice at 21 and 23 days. In contrast, at 25 days, the mice displayed evident cartilage erosion (Fig. 2g). Masson staining further confirmed a gradual reduction in red collagen levels compared with those in the control group, with a prominent decrease observed on day 25 (Fig. 2h). Immunohistochemistry revealed a gradual decrease in CII levels (Fig. 2i). TRAP staining revealed increased osteoclasts in the subchondral bone (Fig. S1h). These findings from the early stages of CIA suggest that collagen loss in the articular cartilage occurs before notable synovial proliferation.Fig. 2Lesions of joints from mice with early CIA. a Experimental design. b Following the conclusion of the 21-day modeling period, arthritis onset in mice was observed between days 21 and 25. c Arthritis scores recorded from 21 to 25 days. d Frequency of arthritis episodes occurring between 21 and 25 days. e Changes in cartilage thickness observed via CT imaging from 21 to 25 days. f Histological assessment of knee joint sections stained with H&E on days 21, 23, and 25 to evaluate the cartilage area and damage scores.

        "MVs were intravenously administered to the mice with CIA once a week for four treatments starting on day 22 (Fig. 3a). CIA scoring commenced on day 21 to evaluate arthritis progression. In the treatment group, the degree of arthritis remained stable, whereas the CIA group presented elevated CIA scores (Fig. 3b). The weights of the mice with CIA continued to decrease after 21 days, whereas the weights of the mice treated with MVs initially decreased but then recovered (Fig. 3c). H&E staining of major organs from all the treated mice revealed no effect of MVs on vital organ morphology (Fig. S1i), indicating the safety of the treatment. In vivo fluorescence imaging revealed enriched MVs near inflamed joints following intravenous administration of MVs (Fig. 3d). Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between inflammation and enriched fluorescence (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0257) (Fig. 3e), suggesting that MVs accumulate at highly inflamed joints to exert their effects. Flow cytometric analysis of the lymph nodes and spleen revealed increased Tfh and Th1/17 cell populations in the mice with CIA, which were reduced in the MV group. In contrast, the Treg and Th2 cell populations decreased in the CIA group but increased in the MV group. In B cells, the number of CD19+ and IL-10+ cells decreased in the mice with CIA but increased after MV treatment, which was consistent with the findings in the lymph node and spleen (Fig. 3f). Spleen staining with CD4 and CD19 antibodies revealed significantly increased expression of CD4 and CD19 in the mice with CIA, which is indicative of T and B-cell activation. After MV treatment, CD4 and CD19 expression in the spleen decreased (Fig. 3g). Spleens from the mice with CIA also presented high expression of IFNγ and IL-17, which were expressed at low levels in the MV-treated mice. The number of T cells expressing IL-4 increased after MV treatment (Fig. 3h). Consistent with the flow cytometric results, analysis of serum inflammatory factors via ELISAs revealed elevated levels of IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, and IL-17A in the CIA group. These levels were lower in the MV-treated group than in the CIA group but remained higher than those in the control group (Fig. 3i). RNA extraction and quantitative analysis via real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of mouse articular cartilage revealed increased expression of IL-1β and TNFα in the mice with CIA, which was lower than that in the MV-treated group. However, no significant differences in IL-6 expression were observed among the three groups (Fig. 3j). Histochemical staining revealed increased IL-1β and TNFα levels in the cartilage region of the CIA group, whereas these levels were lower in the MV group than in the CIA group (Fig. 3k, l). Notably, IL-6 and IL-17 were not detected in the cartilage (Fig. S1l). These results indicate that MVs can reduce systemic inflammation in mice with CIA.Fig. 3MVs alleviate inflammation in joints and systemically. a Experimental design. b CIA scores recorded from days 21 to 45. c Mouse body weights were recorded from days 21 to 45. d Bioluminescence imaging of mice injected with MVs and DiI dye. e Quantification of fluorescence intensity (ctrl vs. CIA, P = 0.0003; CIA vs. CIA-MVs, P = 0.0257). f Flow cytometric analysis of T follicular helper (Tfh+), regulatory T (Treg+), T helper (Th1/2/17+), and B (CD19+ and IL-10+) cells in the lymph and spleen. g Alterations in splenic T (CD4+ red) and B (CD19+ green) cell populations. h Immunofluorescent spleen [IFNγ (red-Th1), IL-4 (green-Th2) and IL-17 (pink-Th17)] analysis was used to observe the distribution and number of Th1/2/17 cells. i Measurement of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, IL-10, and IL-17A expression in mouse serum via ELISAs. j RT-qPCR analysis of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα expression in articular cartilage. k IL-1β expression in articular cartilage.

        "Micro-CT analysis revealed lower bone density and fewer trabeculae in the CIA group than in the control group (P = 0.0007). However, in the CIA group treated with MVs, there was a trend toward recovery in terms of bone density and the number of trabeculae; however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.1107). Compared with those of the control group, 3D CT reconstruction revealed evident cartilage and bone destruction in the knee and ankle joints of the CIA group. Conversely, the MV treatment group presented smoother joint surfaces without notable damage. Statistically significant differences in 3D joint surface scores and Tb were observed (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4a). After the articular cartilage was ground, protein extraction and western blotting were performed. The CIA group presented high expression of ADAMTS-5 and MMP-13, along with decreased expression of CI and CII. In the treatment group, we found reduced expression of ADAMTS-5 and MMP-13, thereby protecting collagen from degradation (Fig. 4b). These findings were further validated by RT-qPCR, which yielded results consistent with those of the western blot analysis (Fig. 4c). H&E staining revealed notable synovial hyperplasia, decreased cartilage thickness, and anterior displacement of the tidemark in the CIA group (Fig. S1j). In contrast, compared with the control group, the treatment group exhibited only slight synovial hyperplasia and minimal changes in cartilage (Fig. S1k). Immunohistochemical staining of joint sections revealed an increased number of ADAMTS-5- and MMP-13-positive chondrocytes in the CIA group. The treatment group and control group presented fewer ADAMTS-5- and MMP-13-positive chondrocytes, although they were still present (Fig. 4e, f). Immunohistochemical staining of joint sections for CI and CII in the control group revealed that CII was located mainly in the middle of the cartilage, whereas CI was observed at the base. In the CIA group, CI migrated to the joint surface, indicating cartilage dissolution and exposure of CI, accompanied by a reduction in the amount of CII. Compared with the control group, the treatment group showed no significant difference, with slight changes in the localization of CI and CII in some areas of the cartilage (Fig. 4g, h). Aggrecan staining of joint sections revealed a significant reduction in aggrecan in the CIA group, whereas the treatment group showed no significant difference compared with the control group (Fig. 4i). MVs may act through the IL-1β/TNFα/MMP-13/ADAMTS-5 axis of cartilage destruction (Fig. 4j). These results indicate that MVs can reduce cartilage destruction in mice with CIA.Fig. 4MVs maintain cartilage stability in mice with early CIA. a CT scans and 3D CT reconstruction of the mouse ankle and knee joints for the analysis of joint destruction and reduced trabecular bone. b Western blot analysis of ADAMTS-5, MMP-13, CI, and CII expression in mouse joint cartilage after cryogenic grinding. c RT-qPCR analysis of ADAMTS-5, MMP-13, CI, and CII expression in mouse joint cartilage. d Analysis of ankle and knee joint sections via safranin O‒fast green staining. e Immunohistochemical staining of ADAMTS-5 in mouse knee joints.

        "After the MVs (CFSE; green) were stained, they were washed and subjected to high-speed centrifugation. Then, the MVs were added to cultured chondrocytes for 24 h. After fixation with paraformaldehyde, immunostaining was performed with the F-actin microfilament protein fluorescent dyes phalloidin (red) and Hoechst (blue), which revealed MVs within the cells (Fig. 5a). For the Transwell experiments, chondrocytes and MVs were added to the bottom chamber, while PBMCs and LPS were added to the upper chamber. Immunofluorescence staining for IL-1β and TNFα revealed increased expression in the LPS group, whereas the LPS+MVs group presented no significant differences in expression. The cell supernatants were subjected to ELISA analysis after sonication, and the results were consistent with those of the immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5b). LPS stimulation increased the expression of IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, and IL-17A, whereas LPS stimulation in the presence of MVs resulted in decreased expression of these cytokines (Fig. 5c). Lysis and PCR analysis of the bottom chondrocytes revealed that MVs can reduce the levels of IL-1β and TNFα on the cartilage surface. In chondrocytes, stimulation with IL-1β or TNFα separately led to increased expression of the corresponding cytokines. After cell sonication, ELISAs of the cell suspensions confirmed the increase in TNFα expression in the IL-1β group and increased IL-1β expression in the TNFα group (Fig. 5d). The fluorescence immunostaining results were consistent with the ELISA results. RT-qPCR analysis of the cells yielded results consistent with the other findings (Fig. 5e, f). These results suggest that MVs can reduce immune inflammation and reduce IL-1β and TNFα in chondrocytes.Fig. 5Assessment of the anti-inflammatory effects of MVs in cells. a Observation of MVs entering chondrocytes via confocal microscopy (MVs-green-CFSE, cells-red-phalloidin, nuclei-blue-Hoechst). b Immunofluorescence analysis of IL-1β and TNFα expression in cartilage (IL-1β and TNFα-red, nucleus blue) from cocultured PBMCs and chondrocytes. c ELISA analysis of the expression of IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, and IL-17A in the supernatant after MV intervention. d ELISAs and RT-qPCR analysis of the expression of IL-1β and TNFα in cartilage. e Immunofluorescence analysis of the expression of IL-1β and TNFα in chondrocytes after MV intervention (IL-1β and TNFα-red, nuclei-blue). f ELISAs and RT-qPCR analysis of IL-1β and TNFα expression in chondrocytes.

        "Chondrocytes were obtained from RA patients who were treated with MVs, and cell migration was observed through scratch assays at 0 and 24 h. MVs clearly increased the migration of chondrocytes (Fig. 6a). After 12 h of passage, the addition of MVs resulted in a significant increase in cell proliferation at 48 h, as indicated by the red staining observed via the trypan blue method (Fig. 6b). The cells were cultured with MVs for 12 h, and subsequent flow cytometric analysis revealed a decrease in apoptosis in the dishes supplemented with MVs (Fig. 6c). Transcriptome sequencing was performed on both groups, and the analysis revealed the differential expression of 43 circRNAs, 101 miRNAs, and 45 lncRNAs. Thus, MVs may contribute to cellular repair and the alleviation of chondrocyte inflammation (Fig. 6d–f). As shown in Table 3, after treatment with IL-1β and TNFα, fluorescence immunostaining revealed reduced expression of ADAMTS-5 and MMP-13 in the MV group, which was consistent with the quantitative results obtained through RT-qPCR analysis (Fig. 6g, h). Similarly, immunofluorescence staining for CI and CII revealed that MVs maintained the expression of these collagen types. The Western blot results were consistent with the fluorescence immunostaining results (Fig. 6i–l).Fig. 6MVs protect chondrocytes. a–c Effects of MVs on chondrocyte migration (migration assay, ImageJ was used to measure the migratory distance and scratch blank area), proliferation (CCK-8 was used to detect proliferation, while red O staining was used to observe chondrocyte proliferation) and apoptosis (Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining, flow cytometry analysis, and Annexin V+/PI+ staining were used as indicators of apoptosis). d–f Effect of MVs on RNA expression in chondrocytes. After stimulation with MVs, whole-transcriptome analysis via total RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed 43 circRNAs, 101 miRNAs, and 45 lncRNAs in chondrocytes, as detailed in Table 3. g, h Effects of MVs on IL-1β- and TNFα-stimulated MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 [immunofluorescence (red: MMP-13/ADAMTS-5; blue: DAPI) and RT-qPCR] in chondrocytes. i–k Effects of MVs on CI and CII in IL-1β- and TNFα-stimulated chondrocytes [immunofluorescence (CI-red, CII-green, and DAPI-blue and western blotting]. l Relationship between cartilage destruction and the IL-1β/TNFα/ADAMTS-5/MMP-13 ratio.

        "RA involves dysregulation of the immune system and pathological changes in cartilage at a very early stage. Controlling inflammation and cartilage destruction early on may be an effective approach for treating RA. MSCs are a class of cells characterized by self-renewal and multidirectional differentiation capabilities [28, 29]. Due to their unique functions, these cells have been extensively researched for the treatment of rare and challenging diseases [30]. Although several MSC-based products have received clinical approval, the complexity of cell therapeutic mechanisms and the uncertainties of potential risks have impeded the advancement and clinical application of stem cell therapy. Consequently, alternative research approaches have emerged, including preclinical studies involving MSC exos and MSC extracellular vesicles. These studies are based on the premise that nonimmunogenic exos and EVs carry therapeutic factors or proteins and have the potential to treat diseases [31–33]. Exos are vesicle-like structures released through exocytosis by fusing with the cell membrane and entering the extracellular space. Cellular MVs, which possess membrane structures, are similar to exos but are larger in diameter and richer in content [34]. In this study, we obtained MSCs from healthy human umbilical cords. These cells displayed typical MSC characteristics, such as the expression of the stem cell surface markers CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105 and the potential for multilineage differentiation. MSC-MVs were obtained through stimulation and gradient centrifugation. We used electron microscopy to confirm their vesicular structure, and Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of the vesicular markers CD63 and Annexin. Flow cytometry also revealed that MVs retained their stem cell properties, as evidenced by their expression of surface markers characteristic of stem cells.",
        "RA is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent joint inflammation and destruction. If left untreated, this condition leads to cartilage degradation and chondrocyte destruction, resulting in cartilage surface depressions, ulcers, joint deformities, and loss of joint function [35]. Generally, research on RA has focused on the impact of synovial hyperplasia on joints. Few reports have investigated cartilage, but recent studies have demonstrated that cartilage destruction occurs prior to arthritis. In 2012, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) established different stages of pre-RA, shedding light on early or asymptomatic phases of the disease. Pre-RA is considered a “window of opportunity” [36] for treatment, emphasizing the importance of early intervention. Studies have revealed that pathological changes in bone and cartilage can be observed before the onset of synovitis in pre-RA. Patients often experience clinical symptoms such as bone pain, fatigue, joint discomfort, fever, and systemic malaise during this preclinical phase [37]. Comparative analyses between pre-RA and non-RA cohorts revealed strong correlations with TNFα and IL-1β [38]. Clinical data demonstrate that bone and cartilage loss occur before the onset of inflammation during the autoimmune phase. Early serological findings include positive anti-CII antibodies and alterations in the N-terminal peptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) [39]. Using a mouse CIA model, we found that mice exhibit a reduction in the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage, decreased collagen, increased osteoclasts, and weight loss before the onset of arthritis. These findings align with the pathological changes observed in human patients in the early clinical stages [40].",
        "CIA is the most widely used animal model in RA research because of its similarities with RA, such as systemic chronic inflammation, synovial hyperplasia, mononuclear cell infiltration, cartilage degradation, and bone destruction. Like RA, CIA is associated with susceptibility and the expression of specific MHC class II genes [41]. However, the main differences are the absence of ACPAs and elevated RF levels in individuals with CIA, as well as the absence of notable sex differences and self-limiting inflammation. The CIA model involves two injections of CII on day 0 and day 14 or 21 to elicit a specific response from T and B cells, which mimics the effects of autoimmunity. Through control of the dosage of injection, the arthritis model can be manipulated, as the pathogenesis of CIA is largely mediated by CII-specific antibodies (predominantly the IgG2 subclass) that bind to and activate complement, leading to arthritis. The cellular cytokines and immune cells involved in early CIA closely reflect the majority of the pathological mechanisms underlying early RA immune alterations, including proinflammatory Th1 cells, anti-inflammatory Th2 cells, Th17 cells, follicular helper T (Tfh) cells assisting in B-cell activation and antibody production, and the production of numerous inflammatory factors [42, 43]. Thus, the CIA model is suitable for studying early or pre-RA. In our study, we also observed changes in immune cells, inflammatory cytokines, and cartilage following the injection of the collagen emulsion in the early stage, which was consistent with clinical symptoms and characteristics.",
        "RA is estimated to affect 0.5–1% of the total population, resulting in a major burden on society because of the need for long-term treatment and working years of life lost. Despite advancements in RA treatment and the introduction of disease-modifying rheumatoid arthritis drugs (DMARDs), many patients suffer from refractory RA, and the long-term side effects of medication pose serious risks to their health [44–46]. Therefore, more attention has been given to the early stages of the disease as a “window of opportunity” for treatment, as therapy at this stage may change the course of disease development. This notion has been supported by research on early or preclinical stages of RA, where studies on stem cells [47], biologics (abatacept [48], tocilizumab [49]), and antirheumatic drugs [50] have been conducted and showed that earlier treatment leads to long-term benefits for patients. The 2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) collaborative initiative has also promoted early diagnosis and treatment. Cartilage invasion represents irreversible destruction, and chronic inflammation following the onset of RA also appears to be irreversible. Therefore, treatments administered during preclinical stages where pathological changes are still reversible could be crucial. Stem cell research has shown that stem cells can alleviate the symptoms of RA patients through immunomodulation and cartilage regeneration, playing an important role in refractory RA [51]. In a study of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles and MVs, these vesicles were found to have important immunomodulatory effects on RA [52]. In our study, after intravenous injection of MVs in CIA model mice, MVs seemed to accumulate in immune organs and inflamed areas. Additionally, mice with CIA presented significant improvements in joint scores and inflammation, as well as a reduction in articular cartilage changes. Early intervention may have the potential to alter the outcome of this disease.",
        "In arthritis, cartilage destruction is the direct cause of joint dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying cartilage destruction in arthritis are complex and involve factors such as inflammation, abnormal cartilage cell function, enzyme activation, and the involvement of inflammatory cytokines [53, 54]. From a pathological perspective, cartilage degradation and matrix degradation are the core processes of arthritis-related cartilage destruction [55]. Previous studies have shown that TNFα and IL-1β can directly damage cartilage cells and promote other destructive mechanisms [56]. TNFα can exert a direct toxic effect on cartilage cells, leading to their apoptosis. Moreover, TNFα can stimulate the production of other inflammatory cytokines and enzymes, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), by cartilage cells, further exacerbating the process of arthritis [57]. IL-1β primarily promotes inflammatory responses and tissue damage. This molecule directly stimulates cartilage cells to produce enzymes, such as MMPs and aggrecanases (AGGs), leading to the degradation and destruction of the cartilage matrix. TNFα and IL-1β can also induce the production of ADAMTSs (ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5) by cartilage cells and other cells. ADAMTSs are capable of cleaving and degrading specific molecules in cartilage tissue, such as proteoglycans and collagen [58]. Overactivation of ADAMTSs leads to the degradation of aggrecan molecules, which in turn results in the destruction and loss of the cartilage matrix, thereby affecting the structure and function of cartilage. In this study, both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that MVs can reduce TNFα and IL-1β levels, thereby decreasing the levels of MMPs and ADAMTSs and improving joint conditions. Notably, IL-6 appears to be more abundant in the synovium and less prevalent in cartilage tissue.",
        "In summary, MSCs-MVs possess the characteristics of MSCs and exert a protective effect on the joints of mice with CIA. However, the therapeutic effects of MVs remain complex, and the specific mechanisms underlying their effects are difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, MVs represent a promising new approach for the management of early RA. It is hoped that the “window of opportunity” for treating RA can be seized to reverse early damage and alter the disease course.",
        "Injection of MSCs-MVs into early CIA models effectively controlled CIA, reducing cartilage destruction in the joints. The expression of IL-1β and TNFα in the serum and cartilage decreased, along with decreased expression of MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 in the cartilage and reduced collagen content. In vitro experiments also confirmed that MVs can reduce IL-1β and TNFα expression in cartilage cells, thereby reducing the expression of MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 and maintaining collagen expression in cartilage cells.",

        "AHSCT is more effective than both RTX and CIT in prolonging survival and inducing prolonged remission in patients with rapidly progressive dcSSc.",
        "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the accumulation of extracellular collagen matrix in target organs and tissues, such as skin, lung, gut and heart [1]. The clinical spectrum of SSc is largely heterogeneous, but usually two distinct forms are recognized., i.e., the limited cutaneous (lc) and the diffuse cutaneous (dc) SSc. The two variants strongly differ in the extension of cutaneous involvement, type and severity of internal organ involvement, and prognosis. The survival of patients with SSc has improved during the last decades, with an overall 10-year survival ranging from 63 to 75.5% [2, 3], interstitial lung disease, pulmonary artery hypertension and cardiac issues being the leading causes of death [4]. However, rapidly progressive form of the disease can lead to a 5-year mortality rate around 35% [5]. This has pushed the clinicians to treat this kind of patients in a more aggressive manner. For many years the standard of care in this subset of patients has been limited to the use of immunosuppressive therapy such as methotrexate (MTX), cyclophosphamide (CYC), azathioprine (AZA) or mycofenolate mofetil (MMF). Contradictory results have been obtained with these agents due to the different modality of their use in series of patients which were not comparable [6].",
        "The arrival of newer target therapies has opened new possibilities for the treatment of SSc as a whole and for specific different pathological features. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and open labeled studies have shown that tocilizumab and rituximab (RTX) may be effective in modulating the inflammatory process underlying the disorder, and nintedanib in lowering the fibrosis progression in some target organs such as the lung [7–10].",
        "In rapidly progressive cases of dcSSc, autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has been recently considered as a standard-of-care therapeutic option [11, 12]. This procedure was first assessed in open label trials and its effectiveness, in lowering the disease progression and improving the survival rate, was then confirmed by three RCTs [13, 14].",
        "To our knowledge, to date, no studies have been published comparing the long-term outcome in patients with only rapidly progressive dcSSc treated with AHSCT with those who received RTX and conventional immunosuppressive therapies (CIT).",
        "In the present retrospective study our aim was to compare different therapeutical regimens (AHSCT vs. patients treated RTX vs. historical group of patients who received CIT), in patients with rapidly progressive form of dcSSc.",
        "All the patients included in this retrospective study and treated with the three different therapeutic regimens had a rapidly progressive dcSSc, characterized by a modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) ≥ 14 at the baseline observation and a disease duration less than 4 years. They met the 1993 American College of Rheumatology and, when retrospectively evaluated, also the 2013 ACR-EULAR criteria [15, 16].",
        "For the intention of the present study and to more precisely assess the disease response to the different treatment regimens within the three groups, we have selected specific outcome measures that can provide quantitative or semi-quantitative assessment of different disease features. Specifically, we considered (i) the severity of skin involvement measured by the mRSS. Reduction of at least 5 points or of 25% or more of the baseline values of this score were taken into account to define the improvement of skin involvement [17]; (ii) the degree of lung function impairment was assessed by forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusion lung of carbon monoxide (DLCO), expressed as a percentage of the predicted value. Reduction of FVC ≥ 10% alone and decline of FVC ≥ 10% or DLCO ≥ 15% were considered the lung function impairment defining the progression of lung involvement [18]; (iii) the overall assessment of disease activity, using the Revised EUSTAR Activity Index (REAI) scoring system. Values ≥ 2.5 were considered as indicative of high level of disease activity, and consequently the decline of this score below this value as an important achievement [19]. Finally, the disease-related mortality rate in the differently treated groups was also recorded during the follow-up and at the end of the study period.",
        "The assessment of all these parameters was done once a year in the whole population of patients. Clinical monitoring of the disease features was also made every 3–6 months, according to the disease course in any single case.",
        "Between 2003 and 2019, 35 patients with rapidly progressive dcSSc underwent AHSCT in our Scleroderma Unit. Criteria for inclusion were a clinical activity score equal or over 2.5, according to the REAI [19], and a disease duration ≤ 4 years. This cut-off value for disease duration was chosen in agreement with that used in other studies, namely the Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial [20]. Candidates for AHSCT were considered those patients whose response to CIT was nil or very unsatisfactory. Previous unsuccessful immunosuppressive treatment included MTX (15–25 mg/week) in 17 patients, AZA in 4, CYC (1 g monthly for 2 months) in 4, MMF in 10, in any case associated with low-dose prednisone (≤ 7.5 mg/day).",
        "Important co-morbidities and any pre-existing or current severe disease-related organ involvement, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (detected by echocardiography and confirmed by right heart catheterization), scleroderma renal crisis, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with a DLCO under 70% of the predicted value, and scleroderma cardiopathy with an ejection fraction below 45%, were all considered exclusion criteria for AHSCT [21]. To have a correct selection, a complete clinical and instrumental work up was made before starting the transplantation procedure. The AHSCT procedure was performed similarly to what had been done in previous studies [20]. Previous unsuccessful immunosuppressive therapies were discontinued at least 1 month before the mobilization procedure. Thirty-four patients received conditioning with high-dose CYC (CYC 200 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg Thymoglobulin), 30 with and 2 without CD34 selection of the graft; two patients received a fludarabine-based cardiac-safe conditioning (rituximab 1000 mg, CYC 60 mg/kg and fludarabine 120 mg/m2).",
        "None of the transplanted patients enrolled in this study was included in other studies and namely in the ASTIS trial, although some of the authors of the present study took part in that multicenter survey.",

        "From 2012 to 2019, 29 patients with rapidly progressive dcSSc were treated with RTX. This group of patients included those who had received RTX for at least 24 months and with no previous CYC treatment history.",
        "The criteria for inclusion in this therapeutic group were having a rapidly progressive dcSSc with the same characteristics as the transplanted patients but to have refused or to be strongly puzzled when the AHSCT option was proposed. RTX treatment was given in courses once every 6 months so that each course would contain 2 doses (each of 1000 mg, intravenously administered) with two-week intervals, in combination with methyl-prednisolone (100 mg), antihistamine and paracetamol premedication. All patients had maintenance RTX infusions of 1 g every 6 months (median number 3, range 2–5). Seventeen patients (58%) also received another CIT concomitantly: MMF (8), MTX (9). Monthly IVIG was also administered initially in 3 patients (10%), while 12 patients (41%) were treated with RTX and steroids only.",
        "More details on the demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients are reported in Table 1.",
        "This is a historical group of 36 patients who were treated with CIT from 1991 to 2003 with the aim of stopping or reducing the clinical progression of their rapidly progressive dcSSc. These patients were treated with multiple immunosuppressive regimens, either sequentially or with combinations of different drugs. Overall, 25 of these patients received CYC (monthly infusions for 6 months, some of them also adjunctive infusions at 9 and 12 months), 18 received MTX (10–20 mg per week), 7 received MMF (2 or 3 gr per day), 18 received AZA (100–200 mg per day) and 3 received IVIG (400 mg/kg per day, 5 days per month for 6 months). None of these patients was treated with a unique therapeutical regimen during the entire follow up, but different CIT were used in double combination or in subsequent times. Considering this extreme inhomogeneity of the therapeutical regimens, it was decided to analyse the CIT-treated group as a whole.",
        "Data on this group of CIT-treated and their comparison with data from 18 transplanted patients were the subject of a previous report from our group [22]. Additional details on this control population are reported in Table 1.",
        "Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test were used to compare overall survival observed in the different groups of patients during the 5-year follow-up. Hazard Ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were also computed. The same statistical approach was adopted to analyse the survival of baseline values of the mRSS. Reduction of this parameter of 5 or more points or of 25% or more in comparison with the baseline values was considered as indicative of improvement of skin involvement [17]. Progression of lung involvement was derived by the survival curve of FVC and FVC/DLCO in combination, where the above-mentioned overtime percentual changes of these lung function tests were considered [18]. Finally, the survival curve of REAI was derived and a decrease of this score under 2.5 was taken into account as an important decline of disease activity [19].",
        "It is worth noting that FVC, mRSS and REAI are not independent variables since both FVC and the mRSS are included in the REAI scoring system. However, we decided to separately analyze these parameters since FVC and the mRSS may represent the mirror of some specific organ involvement (lung and skin, respectively), while REAI is a composite measure of global disease activity.",
        "Overtime changes of mRSS and FVC in the three different groups were analyzed and compared to each other using generalized linear model with repeated measures. Sphericity of each variance was evaluated computing the ε value. Since this value in all the comparisons was < 0.75, a correction according to Greenhouse-Geisser method was made.",
        "Table 1 reports the main demographic and clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients subdivided into the three groups.",
        "The 35 transplanted patients (27 females and 8 males) had a median age of 44 years (ranging from 20 to 64), a median disease duration of 24 months (ranging from 10 to 48), and a median baseline mRSS of 20.5 (ranging from 15 to 32). The median FVC was 89% of the predicted value, ranging from 79 to 110. At baseline, the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was considered normal in 14 patients (41%), while it showed evidence of mild ILD in the remaining 21. As far as disease activity level in the AHSCT-treated group is concerned, all the enrolled patients had a median REAI score of 6.0 (ranging from 4.12 to 7.75).",
        "Twenty-nine patients were treated with RTX. Their demographic and clinical features were almost completely identical to those of the AHSCT- and CIT-treated patients. The only slight difference was that the RTX-treated patients had a more restricted age range with respect to the patients in the other two groups, although the median age was the same (see Table 1).",
        "The demographic and clinical findings of the group of 36 patients treated with CIT were also the same as those of the other two groups. The only difference is the lower prevalence of anti-topoisomerase-I antibodies (anti-Scl70) in this group. However, the difference is not statistically significant (see Table 1).",
        "Following the AHSCT, one patient died from interstitial pneumonia at day 65, and another died immediately after transplantation procedure due to fulminant viral myocarditis, accounting for a transplant-related mortality of 5.7%. It is important to underline that these two AHSCT-related deaths happened in the early years in which our group experienced the transplantation procedure (2007 and 2008, respectively). None of the transplanted patients died later because of the more stringent enrolment criteria we adopted before deciding to apply the AHSCT procedure. The data from these patients were not considered when we analyzed the disease-related outcome variables in the AHSCT-treated patients. The adverse events observed during the whole transplantation procedure were not different, in terms of prevalence and severity, from those reported in previous similar studies [20, 22]. Namely, in the mobilization phase we observed six cases of fever of unknown origin, three case of mucositis and one case of haemorrhagic cystitis. During aplasia, we recorded ten cases of fever of unknown origin, eight cases of fever with positive blood culture and four cases of pneumonia. All the observed infections resolved thanks to adequate antibiotic treatment. In one case, we observed a transient reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction, and in another one a phase of arterial hypotension due to unexplained polyuria that required adequate re-hydration. No significant modifications of the SSc disease course were observed immediately after the mobilization phase and transplantation procedure.",
        "No significant adverse event was observed in long-term follow-up after AHSCT and during the RTX and CIT treatment.",
        "Overall survival in the three groups of differently treated patients is shown in Fig. 1. The survival rate in the AHSCT-treated patients is significantly higher than what was observed in the other two groups. The overall survival is not statistically different between the RTX- and CIT-treated patients (see results of log-rank test in Table 2). The probability of a reduction of the mRSS of at least 5 points and of 25% or more are both significantly higher in transplanted patients in comparison with both patients treated with RTX and CIT. There is also a significant difference of this probability between the RTX- and CIT-treated patients, being the RTX therapeutical regimen slightly superior to CITs in improving skin involvement (Fig. 2a and b; Table 2 for detailed results).",
        "The probability of a decline of lung function (decrease FVC ≥ 10% and combined decline of FVC ≥ 10% or DLCO ≥ 15% or both) was significantly higher in RTX- and CIT-treated groups in comparison with patients who underwent AHSCT. No significant difference in the lung function test decline was observed between RTX- and CIT-treated patients (Fig. 2c; Table 2).",
        "The probability of reduction of REAI under 2.5 points is significantly higher in transplanted AHSCT patients in comparison with RTX- and CIT-treated groups. The probability of decline of this disease activity score was also significantly higher in patients treated with RTX in comparison with CIT-treated group (Fig. 2d; Table 2 for detailed results).",

        "On the whole, the results of this study demonstrate that AHSCT procedure in patients with rapidly progressive dcSSc is more effective than RTX and CIT in improving the overall survival and in greatly decreasing the severity of skin thickness, measured by the mRSS, the level of disease activity, measured by a global assessment index, and in longer maintaining the lung function. RTX treatment is also more effective than CIT, although with a lower level of significance, in reducing skin impairment, disease activity, and in preserving lung function.",
        "Finding an effective treatment for patients with dcSSc has been the object of numerous therapeutic studies in the past decades [6]. Different immunosuppressive agents have been tested in controlled trials for the treatment of this subset of patients with SSc, but contradictory results have been obtained. Namely, only one RCT was conducted with oral CYC, but this study failed to demonstrate any significant effect at two years in improving FVC in comparison with placebo, while it was found to induce a mild improvement of skin thickness and quality of life [23]. Two other RCTs were carried out comparing oral CYC with AZA plus low dose steroids, and with MMF. The first one, where the endpoints were represented by different lung function parameters, gave completely negative results in terms of differences between the two therapeutic regimens [24]. The second one indicated that both CYC and MMF were able to mildly improve FVC and to lower the mRSS in a comparable manner [25]. Only one large RCT was performed with MTX versus placebo in 2001, but this study failed to record any significant effectiveness in the treated group in terms of mRSS improvement [26].",
        "The fact that AHSCT procedure in patients with a rapidly progressive form of dcSSc can be considered more effective than CIT is a widely confirmed statement. Three different trials (ASSIST, monocentric in USA, ASTIS, multicentric in Europe, SCOT multicentric in USA/Canada) comparing AHSCT with conventional intravenous CYC therapy have been published in the last decades [20, 27, 28]. The overall results can be summarized as follows: the mRSS greatly improved in the AHSCT treated patients in comparison with controls, who either improved to a lesser extent or worsened; lung function tests mildly improved in the transplanted patients and mildly worsened in the control group; quality of life improved in the AHSCT groups while it improved to a lesser extent or worsened in the CYC-treated patients. Mainly, at the fourth year of follow-up, the mortality rate was significantly lower in transplanted patients in the ASTIS and SCOT trials than in the CYC treated patients [20, 28].",
        "Similar results were obtained in a retrospective case-control study performed by our group some years ago. In this study, we also reported a significant improvement of overall survival, mRSS and disease activity index in the AHSCT group, and a significantly more rapid decline of lung diffusion capacity in the CIT-treated control group [22].",
        "In the present study, where the number of transplanted patients was expanded, the comparison with the historical group of CIT-treated patients reinforces the results already reported in our previous study and in published RCTs, again demonstrating the superiority of AHSCT procedure in rapidly decreasing the mRSS and the level of global disease activity, in longer maintaining lung function, and in drastically improving the mortality rate. At the end of the five-year follow-up, only 3 out of 33 patients died in the transplanted group in comparison to 22 out of 36 cases in the CIT-treated group. It is worth noting that the present study clearly shows that AHSCT procedure is also superior to RTX treatment when all the disease progression parameters were considered and also when the overall survival was recorded. In the RTX group death occurred in 11 out of 29 patients.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the comparison of AHSCT procedure and RTX treatment was head-to-head, including long-term results. A recently published study has shown the non-superiority of AHSCT adopted in 16 patients with respect to a combination therapy of RTX plus MMF, given to 21 patients. Apart from the fact that the two populations were quite small, and the follow-up was limited to 12 months, it is important to note that the RTX/MMF-treated group included 9 patients with lcSSc, a subset of patients that do not usually have a rapidly progressive disease [29].",
        "Finally, our study also shows that RTX treatment works better than CIT in terms of reduction of global disease activity, skin impairment and longer preserving of lung function. This latter result was obtained only when FVC decline was evaluated by analysis of the variance with repeated measures, but not by the survival curve analysis.",
        "It is difficult to make a comparison between the data of the present study and the previous trials in which RTX was compared with traditional immunosuppressive agents [30]. Most of these studies were carried out on a very limited number of patients [31–39], or included a consistent number of patients with lcSSc [36, 40–42], with FVC baseline values under 70% [33, 37–40, 42–46], and a follow-up time from 6 months and 2 years [31, 33–35, 37–39, 41, 44–46]. A long-term prospective study was conducted by Daoussis et al. in 33 patients (30 with dcSSc) who were treated with RTX and 18 patients receiving different types of CIT. Apart from the fact that the two populations differed in disease duration, a consistent number of patients received a combination therapy (RTX plus MMF), and a very limited number of patients completed the follow up of seven years. Nevertheless, the results of this trial suggest that RTX may be more effective than CIT in preserving lung function at both 2 and 7 years and in more rapidly reducing the mRSS [40].",
        "In conclusion, in agreement with previous controlled studies, the present one confirms that AHSCT is more effective than CIT in treating patients with a rapidly progressive form of dcSSc in its early phase, quite speedily improving skin involvement, disease activity, decreasing mortality rate and maintaining lung function for a longer time. Similar significant differences are also observed when the AHSCT procedure is compared with RTX therapy. However, RTX therapy seems to offer some advantages with respect to traditional immunosuppressive agents in inducing a decline of the disease activity index, a rapid reduction of the mRSS, and in preserving the lung function.",
        "Hot issues are still unsolved. Firstly, transplantation related mortality still exists, although significantly reduced. In this regard important progress has been made thanks to a better selection of patients at low risk for transplantation, which has been achieved by a more extensive preliminary evaluation of lung and cardiac performances [21], and to the improvements adopted in the different steps of transplantation procedure. Another question to be answered is how long the effects of AHSCT will last. Preliminary data indicate that the incidence of a disease relapse could happen between 4 and 6 years after transplantation [47]. To capture the moment of relapse we certainly need a better definition of it, and validated instruments to catch and measure this event. Finally, which therapeutic approach we should adopt for longer maintenance of the results of AHSCT and eventually to avoid or treat the relapse, is largely unknown. Further studies are certainly necessary to approach and solve these important unmet issues.",

YM-58483 was continuously injected subcutaneously in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouS.E.M.odel using an implanted osmotic pump. The severity of CIA was evaluated using the following parameters: body weight, hind paw volume, clinical score, histological analysis, cytokine levels, Ca(2+) influx, and specific IgG production. The efficacy of long-term application of YM-58483 was also verified ex vivo in RA patient-derived peripheral blood monocytes. Assessment of the clinical severity of CIA, cytokine profile in serum and joint protein extracts, and specific IgG production showed that continuous application of YM-58483 suppressed synovial inflammation by inhibiting immune cell activity. Chemical screening and hepatography indicated that long-term subcutaneous delivery of YM-58483 was safer than oral administration for systemic application. Moreover, constant preincubation with YM-58483 at an IC(50) of 0.1-1 nM altered proinflammatory cytokine production ex vivo in peripheral T cells derived from RA patients. Our findings suggest that continuous long-term application of appropriate CRAC inhibitors such as YM-58483 is a potential therapeutic strategy for global immunosuppression in RA.

      "abstract": "In the adult, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are normally physiologically quiescent, arranged circumferentially in one or more layers within blood vessel walls. Remodelling of native VSMC to a proliferative state for vascular development, adaptation or repair is driven by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). A key effector downstream of PDGF receptors is store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) mediated through the plasma membrane calcium ion channel, ORAI1, which is activated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium store sensor, stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1). This SOCE was shown to play fundamental roles in the pathological remodelling of VSMC. Exciting transgenic lineage-tracing studies have revealed that the contribution of the phenotypically-modulated VSMC in atherosclerotic plaque formation is more significant than previously appreciated, and growing evidence supports the relevance of ORAI1 signalling in this pathologic remodelling. ORAI1 has also emerged as an attractive potential therapeutic target as it is accessible to extracellular compound inhibition. This is further supported by the progression of several ORAI1 inhibitors into clinical trials. Here we discuss the current knowledge of ORAI1-mediated signalling in pathologic vascular remodelling, particularly in the settings of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and neointimal hyperplasia, and the recent developments in our understanding of the mechanisms by which ORAI1 coordinates VSMC phenotypic remodelling, through the activation of key transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT).

        "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) defines the conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. CVD is currently the leading cause of global mortality, accounting for an estimated 17 million deaths annually (WHO, 2017). This figure is anticipated to rise as the prevalence in low and middle-income countries increases. CVD is associated with classical risk factors, including obesity (Poirier et al., 2006), smoking (Keto et al., 2016), family history (Dorairaj and Panniyammakal, 2012; Jeemon et al., 2017), and diabetes (Rydén et al., 2013; Shah et al., 2015). Atherosclerotic CVD (e.g., ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease), pulmonary hypertension and aneurysm formation have all been associated with pathological remodelling behaviour of the native vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) within the arterial wall. Similarly, failure of surgical revascularisation to treat atherosclerotic CVD lesions (bypass grafting with autologous vein or prosthetic graft) or percutaneous coronary intervention/peripheral artery endovascular intervention (angioplasty+/−stenting) is associated with neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) which is also a manifestation of pathological vascular remodelling. The ability to selectively inhibit such pathological remodelling of VSMC is therefore considered to be a potentially fruitful therapeutic strategy across this range of cardiovascular pathologies. In order to achieve this, an identifiable, specific, druggable target is required. In this review we present an update on the evidence supporting the ORAI1 Ca2+ channel as a potential therapeutic target and the current status of inhibitor development. The focus is on atherosclerotic CVD and NIH as little evidence exists regarding aneurysm disease in this context and we recently reviewed the evidence supporting ORAI1 as a target in pulmonary hypertension (Rode et al., 2018).",
        "The VSMC is a specialised cell type which is optimised for vascular contractility and the modulation of vascular tone via its contractile apparatus, which depends on smooth muscle contractile proteins such as alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) and smooth muscle 22 alpha (SM22α). These “contractile” VSMCs usually reside in the tunica media of the vessel wall and are classically associated with diseases arising from altered vascular tone, such as hypertension. VSMC intracellular free calcium levels and L-type Ca2+ channel activity are hallmarks of excessive vascular contractility and are targeted by calcium channel blocking anti-hypertensive drugs in the clinic.",
        "When new blood vessels form during embryogenesis, the local VSMC sub-populations envelop the angiogenic endothelial cells to build the vascular tree. Unlike other specialised cell types, such as the cardiomyocyte, VSMCs are not terminally differentiated. In cases of vascular injury, the contractile VSMCs retain the ability to de-differentiate to an immature, plastic, secretory, and “synthetic” state. These phenotypically modulated VSMCs have reduced expression of contractile proteins, while displaying high indices of proliferation, migration, synthesis and secretion of cytokines and tropoelastins. This phenotypic switch generates a range of de-differentiated VSMC phenotypes, including macrophage-like, osteoblast-like and myofibroblast-like VSMC phenotypes, as reviewed in Sorokin et al. (2020). This heterogeneity in VSMC populations within the healthy vessel wall was evident in the heterogeneity of the single VSMCs transcriptional profiles defined by single cell RNA-sequencing (Dobnikar et al., 2018).",
        "The critical driver of this process is platelet derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) signalling through the PDGF receptor beta, PDGFRβ (Owens et al., 2004; Thomas et al., 2009). In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that PDGF-BB negatively regulates expression of VSMC contractile markers and promotes the phenotypic switch toward a plastic and secretory phenotype. Production of PDGF-BB by activated platelets, macrophages, endothelial cells and even phenotypically modulated VSMCs themselves has been described in atherosclerosis and post-surgical NIH mouse models. This results in downregulation of VSMC contractile markers, and subsequent stimulation of VSMC proliferation and migration, reviewed in Owens et al. (2004). There is evidence to support the concept that as the de-differentiated VSMC lay down new elastin and re-populate the vessel, the elastin itself drives the VSMC back toward their contractile phenotype. This is evidenced by the synthetic behaviour of VSMC obtained from elastin-deficient mice and the reduced NIH observed after elastin delivery to the vessel in porcine model of CVD (Karnik et al., 2003). It has been argued by Owens and others that this is likely to be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for repairing vascular trauma that conferred a survival advantage to early man. Major trauma is not the main driver of vascular injury in developed societies; rather the risk factors driving the development of CVD cause much less severe but sustained injury to our vasculature. Therefore, VSMC phenotypic modulation becomes sustained and the vascular remodelling response itself becomes part of the pathological process.",
        "Atherosclerosis is associated with pathological intimal thickening, neovascularisation, and lipoprotein depositions (Virmani et al., 2000). Phenotypically-modulated VSMCs in atherosclerosis have low expression of VSMC contractile markers, and a heightened ability to proliferate and migrate. Synthetic VSMCs have also been associated with increased secretory activities and increased production of extra-cellular matrix (ECM) components, which contribute to the intimal thickening and atherosclerosis progression (Okada et al., 1993; Andreeva et al., 1997). It was long assumed that the role of VSMC was rather limited in atherosclerotic plaque formation. These assumptions were based on conventional VSMC identification approaches; low levels of antibody staining for “classical” VSMC markers, such as α-SMA and SM-MHC were observed in the atherosclerotic plaque. However, as discussed above, the classical VSMC markers are downregulated in phenotypically-modulated VSMC therefore potentially rendering them undetectable via this approach. Recent transgenic lineage-tracing studies have enabled fate tracking of VSMC even following remodelling and loss of contractile protein expression. These elegant studies demonstrated that more than 80% of cells within lesions are phenotypically-modulated VSMC that lack VSMC identification markers (Shankman et al., 2015). Compelling evidence supports the adverse effect of VSMC remodelling to macrophage-like foam cells in lesion pathogenesis. This was demonstrated in a study from the Owens laboratory that utilised an SMC lineage-tracing murine model to study the impact of SMC-specific deletion of the pluripotency factor, Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), which is crucial for the PDGF-induced VSMC phenotypic switch, on atherosclerotic plaque development (Deaton et al., 2009). They showed that loss of Klf4 in VSMC was associated with reduced plaque formation, and improved plaque stability (Shankman et al., 2015), highlighting the key role of VSMC remodelling in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the potential beneficial outcome of inhibiting the extrinsic phenotypic switch to target atherosclerosis. Critically, the same group have demonstrated that VSMC remodelling mediated by the transcription factor Octamer-Binding Protein 4 (Oct4) is crucial for plaque stability, and that Oct4 conditional deletion in VSMC had adverse effects on lesion pathogenesis as shown by the reduced VSMC content in the protective fibrous cap, implying that VSMC phenotypic switching could be beneficial in maintaining plaque stability, and preventing rupture (Otsuka et al., 2015). Additionally, VSMC apoptosis was also shown to be a key feature of plaque vulnerability (Clarke and Bennett, 2006).",
        "The VSMC phenotypic switch is also a key player in the development of NIH. Post-coronary intervention patients remain at risk of developing NIH, with even greater risk in patients with comorbidities, including diabetes and obesity (Silber et al., 2013). Drug-eluting stents that target VSMC proliferation have been shown to improve the clinical outcome following bypass surgery, percutaneous coronary angioplasty, and peripheral revascularisation (Moses et al., 2003), yet a recent systematic review and meta-analysis suggested increased mortality risk 5 years following femoropopliteal application of drug-coated balloons and stents (Katsanos et al., 2018). Despite the beneficial effects of the drug-coated stents and balloons in preventing NIH following angioplasty, the reported possible deleterious long-term side effects of these devices raised concerns about their safety and emphasised the clinical need for new effective therapeutic strategies.",
        "Taken together, strong evidence supports the crucial role of VSMC in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, and NIH. VSMC could be directed toward either beneficial or unfavourable remodelling during lesion development. Nevertheless, suitable (and druggable) molecular therapeutic targets to control VSMC phenotypic remodelling remain elusive.",
        "Calcium (Ca2+) is a universal second messenger and signalling ion that is crucial for a wide range of cellular processes with a temporal range from milliseconds (e.g., contraction) to hours/days (e.g., gene transcription). The concentration of global as well as compartmentalised Ca2+ within the cell regulates Ca2+-dependent regulatory pathways that define VSMC function and phenotype, cytoskeletal remodelling and cell proliferation (Beech, 2007). Cytosolic Ca2+ influx occurs through plasmalemmal Ca2+ channels, including voltage-gated and receptor-operated Ca2+ channels, that allow modulated extracellular Ca2+ influx into the cell. Additionally, Ca2+ fluxes out of and into the major intracellular Ca2+ store, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), are controlled by ryanodine receptors (RyR) and inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) on the ER membrane. PDGF-BB, which drives VSMC phenotypic switch, triggers a global rise in intracellular Ca2+ through the binding of PDGF-BB to its receptor, PDGFRβ, initiating phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase residues, leading to activation of number of signalling pathways implicated in proliferative vascular diseases, including phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The activated PLC enzymes generate IP3, which in turn promotes the activation of IP3R and the release of Ca2+ waves from the ER to the cytosol.",
        "The phenomenon of extracellular Ca2+ influx following intracellular Ca2+ release was first observed by Putney in 1977 (Putney, 1977) and formalised into the theory of capacitative Ca2+ entry in 1986 (Putney, 1986). The proposed hypothesis was then verified by the observed increase in Ca2+ influx in parotid acinar cells following stimulation of store depletion using the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump inhibitor, thapsigargin (Takemura et al., 1989). Afterward, via whole-cell patch-clamp analysis in mast cells, Ca2+ current following store depletion was recorded and characterised as Ca2+-selective inwardly rectifying current, which was termed calcium-release-activated-calcium current (ICRAC) (Hoth and Penner, 1992). Today the process of extracellular Ca2+ influx upon depletion of the intracellular stores is most commonly described as store-operated Ca2+ entry or SOCE and throughout this review we will use this term.",
        "Despite the physiological phenomenon of SOCE being well established, the molecular machinery encoding SOCE remained elusive for many years. In 2005, STIM1 was identified as the ER membrane Ca2+ store sensor and a key component of SOCE (Liou et al., 2005; Roos et al., 2005). It has since been demonstrated that a small pool of STIM1 also exists in the plasma membrane (Li et al., 2015). Identification of patients who presented with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) due to impairment of SOCE in T cells was a key discovery that provided a chance to pinpoint genes encoding calcium-release-activated-calcium current (CRAC) channels (Feske et al., 2005). ORAI1, which is also known as calcium release-activated calcium modulator 1 (CRACM1) and transmembrane protein 142A (TMEM142A) was identified in 2006 by Feske et al. (2006) through a genome-wide screen of linkage in SCID patients that identified a missense mutation in ORAI1, which resulted in impaired ICRAC in T cells, as well as a genome-wide RNA interference screen in Drosophila melanogaster which provided support that ORAI1 is the key component of CRAC channels (Figure 1). In addition, genome-wide RNA-interference screens have identified ORAI1 as a key component of SOCE in D. melanogaster S2 cells, and confirmed the requirement of ORAI1 for generation of ICRAC (Zhang et al., 2006). Ectopic co-expression of ORAI1 and STIM1 was able to augment SOCE in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and Jurkat T cells, implying their independent role in generating ICRAC (Peinelt et al., 2006). Furthermore, Prakriya et al. (2006) revealed that ORAI1 is the de facto pore-forming subunit of CRAC channels, demonstrating that ORAI1 is located at the cell surface, and that mutations within ORAI1 alter the properties of the CRAC current.",
        "Timeline of the main milestones in the discovery of SOCE. In 1986, Putney proposed the hypothesis of SOCE. This hypothesis was then verified and the components of SOCE, which are STIM1 the Ca2+ store sensor and ORAI1 the de facto pore-forming subunit of CRAC channel, were identified. Since this discovery, the involvement of ORAI1 in various vital cellular processes and its contribution to diverse diseases have been recognised.",
        "It was long thought that SOCE was mediated by members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel superfamily, mainly canonical TRP (TRPC) channels, most commonly, TRPC1. Attenuation of SOCE upon TRPC1 knockdown in human submandibular gland (HSG) cells (Liu et al., 2003), and in salivary gland acinar cells isolated from TRPC1 knockout mice (Liu et al., 2007), as well as the augmentation of Ca2+ influx following thapsigargin-mediated store-depletion in cells expressing TRPC1 (Zhu et al., 1996; Liu et al., 2003) provided support for this view. Induced expression of mutant TRPC1 that either encodes truncated protein or harbours mutations at the negatively charged residues in the pore-forming region resulted in remarkable reduction of SOCE, implying that TRPC1 could be a molecular component of CRAC channels (Liu et al., 2003).",
        "The discovery of ORAI1 as the de facto CRAC channel created debate regarding TRPC1 as a direct component of CRAC channels or indirect modulator of SOCE. ORAI1 was shown to associate with TRPC1, with enhanced interaction upon store depletion, suggesting the involvement of ORAI1/TRPC1 channel in SOCE (Jardin et al., 2008). Induced interaction between ORAI1 and TRPC1 was observed in murine pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells with elevated SOCE in response to acute hypoxia (Ng et al., 2012). Ávila-Medina et al. (2016) showed via an in situ proximity ligation assay that the three channels, ORAI1, TRPC1 and voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (CaV1.2) are localised in close proximity in VSMC, suggesting possible functional interactions to modulate Ca2+ signalling. Electrostatic interaction between TRPC1 and STIM1 was reported to be essential for TRPC1 channel gating (Zeng et al., 2008). Moreover, inhibition of the interaction between ORAI1 and STIM1, using an antibody directed against the C-terminal region of ORAI1, impaired STIM1 and TRPC1 association and altered TRPC1 function from a store-operated channel into a store-independent (receptor-operated) channel in human platelet cells (Jardin et al., 2008).",
        "Arguing against the role of TRPC1 as a CRAC channel, the activity of TRPC1 was reported to be independent of the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1, as shown by the lack of effect of STIM1 silencing or overexpression on the channel’s activity in HEK293 cells (Wayne et al., 2009). Nonetheless, an alternative model of communication with intracellular stores was suggested by an enhanced TRPC1 interaction with the IP3 receptor upon store depletion in human platelets, implying that the role of TRPC1 could include coupling to the IP3 receptor in the ER (Rosado et al., 2002). This model was again challenged by the observation that TRPC1 is localised on the intracellular membranes in platelets rather than the plasma membrane (Hassock et al., 2002). It was also reported that TRPC1-induced expression failed to enhance SOCE (Sinkins et al., 1998; Strübing et al., 2001), and VSMC isolated from TRPC1 knockout mice showed no change in SOCE relative to wild type (Dietrich et al., 2007). Despite the evidence supporting the involvement of TRPC1 in SOCE, there is still considerable controversy surrounding the contradictory results of the involvement of TRPC1 in SOCE.",
        "Live cell imaging and electrophysiology studies have shown that following pharmacological store depletion, STIM1 undergoes oligomerisation, aggregation and translocation to the ER-plasma membrane junctions to activate ORAI1 channels (Wu et al., 2006; Liou et al., 2007; Luik et al., 2008; McKeown et al., 2012). This distribution, however, was not observed in PDGF-mediated ORAI1 activation in VSMC, revealing an alternative non-clustering mechanism of ORAI1 activation that is likely to be more relevant to the physiological setting (McKeown et al., 2012). STIM1 is an ER membrane protein consisting of multiple structural domains, with the N-terminus located in ER lumen encompassing canonical EF-hand, hidden EF-hand, and sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains. The Ca2+ sensing ability of STIM1 is mediated by the low Ca2+ binding affinity of the canonical EF-hand intra-ER domain. Ca2+ depletion and release from the EF-hand domain result in exposure of its hydrophobic residues, EF-SAM monomer transformation into an oligomer, elongation of the C-terminal cytosolic domain, and exposure of its CRAC activation domain (CAD) (Huang et al., 2006; Stathopulos et al., 2006; Covington et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2012b). The ORAI1 channel is subsequently activated by direct interaction with CAD, generating ICRAC (Spassova et al., 2006; Park et al., 2009; Figure 2). STIM1 regulation of Ca2 + signalling is not limited to modulating ORAI1 activity. Other Ca2+ channels revealed to be regulated by STIM1 include TRPC1 (Zeng et al., 2008), and the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, CaV1.2 (Wang et al., 2010). Interestingly, while STIM1 activates ORAI1 channels, its interaction with CaV1.2 attenuates the channel’s activity (Wang et al., 2010), supporting a bimodal function of STIM1 in regulating Ca2+ signalling by activating SOCE on one hand and inhibiting voltage-gated Ca2+ channels on the other.",
        "Schematic representation of ORAI1-mediated SOCE in VSMC. Calcium release from ER via inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor results in store depletion, which induces STIM1 oligomerisation to activate ORAI1 channels. ORAI1-mediated SOCE is associated with activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT), which promotes VSMC proliferation and migration. Ca2+ influx via ORAI1 also induces mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake via mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU).",
        "The human ORAI1 gene is 16.128 Kb in length, located at chromosome 12q24.31 (GRCh38/hg38), and is translated into two protein isoforms: ORAI1α (around 33 KDa) and ORAI1β (around 23 KDa) due to different translation initiation sites (Fukushima et al., 2012). Both ORAI1α and ORAI1β assemble to generate functional CRAC channels, and have similar sub-cellular localisation. Nonetheless, ORAI1β has higher mobility in the plasma membrane as it lacks arginine-rich residues that promote ORAI1α interaction with the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) of plasma membrane (Calloway et al., 2011). The ORAI1 protein structure comprises four transmembrane (TM) domains, extracellular TM1-TM2 loop, intracellular TM2-TM3 loop, extracellular TM3-TM4 loop, and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini (Figure 3). ORAI1 was shown to undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation of the asparagine 233 residue located at the extracellular loop-2 (Gwack et al., 2007), and phosphorylation of serine residues at positions 27 and 30 (Kawasaki et al., 2010). ORAI1 assembles to form either homomeric or heteromeric channels. Three members of the ORAI family have been identified, with ORAI2 and ORAI3 encoded by separate genes, ORAI2 and ORAI3, respectively. ORAI channels can assemble as hetero-pentameric channels comprising three ORAI1 and two ORAI3 subunits to generate arachidonate-regulated Ca2+ (ARC) channel, which is activated independent of store depletion. ARC channels show receptor-mediated activation by intracellular arachidonic acid. Interestingly, only ORAI1α and not ORAI1β participates in the formation of ARC channels (Desai et al., 2015).",
        "Protein domain structure of human ORAI1 and the reported ORAI1 mutations. (A) Human ORAI1 protein comprises four transmembrane (TM) domains, two extracellular loops between TM1-TM2, and between TM3-TM4, one intracellular loop between TM2-TM3, arginine rich domain, proline-rich domain, arginine-lysine rich domain, amino terminus (N), and carboxy terminus (C) containing CRAC activation domain (CAD) binding domains (purple lines). (B) The blue lines represent gain-of-function (GOF) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM) patients with elevated CRAC channel activity. The red lines represent ORAI1 loss-of-function (LOF) mutations reported in patients with immunodeficiency, severe combined immune deficiency (SCID), and ectodermal dysplasia anhydrosis (EDA).",
        "ORAI1 monomers are arranged to generate a central ion conduction pore, involving the TM1 domain from each monomer, to generate a circle of TM1 domains. These amino acid residues, surrounding the ion conductance pore, determine the biophysical features of the channel. The glutamic acid residues at position 106 form an outer ring thought to act as a selectivity filter (McNally et al., 2009). Crystal structure determination of the D. melanogaster Orai1 revealed assembly as an unusual and unexpected hexameric complex (Hou et al., 2012). However, the data on functional stoichiometry of human ORAI1 (hORAI1) is contradictory. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging of hORAI1 proteins indicated that they were mainly found as monomers and dimers, with a small fraction found as hexamers (Peckys et al., 2016). Early electrophysiological analysis of hexameric and tetrameric concatemer of hORAI1 suggested that the biophysical properties of the tetrameric concatemer match that of the native CRAC currents, whereas the hexameric concatemer lacked key fingerprint features of CRAC currents (Thompson and Shuttleworth, 2013). More recent electrophysiology studies, however, reported that hexameric hORAI1 concatemer exhibited the key biophysical features of CRAC channels, including Ca2+ selectivity, generating unitary current and rapid Ca2+ dependent channel inactivation (Yen et al., 2016). Similarly, recent analysis of Ca2+ currents mediated by dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric, pentameric, and hexameric concatemers of hORAI1 showed inwardly rectifying store-operated Ca2+ current in all oligomeric concatemers similar to that of native CRAC channels (Cai et al., 2016). This study also found that the hORAI1 tetrameric concatemer only contributed with the N-terminal dimer of the construct to generate the channel; unlike the hORAI1 hexamer, in which all subunits contributed to formation of the channel, suggesting that hORAI1 exists in a hexameric configuration (Cai et al., 2016). This is in accord with the atomic force microscopy imaging study that suggested that hORAI1 assembles as a hexamer (Balasuriya et al., 2014). Although several lines of evidence support the idea that hORAI1 channels exist as hexamers, debate remains.",
        "Recent studies have shed the light on the contribution of the different ORAI homologs in the pattern of Ca2+ signals and revealed their involvement in Ca2+ oscillatory responses (Yoast et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). These oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, with varying spatiotemporal features, are fundamental cellular signals that are efficiently decoded to activate specific gene transcription and certain cellular responses. The pattern of Ca2+ response in cells that lacked either one, two, or the three ORAI homologs was studied and it was shown that ORAI2 and ORAI3 play an essential role in maintaining agonist-induced Ca2+ oscillatory responses, while ORAI1 mainly mediates plateaus. These findings suggest that ORAI2 and ORAI3 heteromerisation with ORAI1 plays a role in mediating the channel response to low agonist concentrations, and modulating CRAC channel-mediated gene transcription processes (Yoast et al., 2020).",
        "Contractile VSMC exhibit almost no proliferation and low expression of ORAI1 and STIM1 proteins. Increased expression of these proteins was shown to be associated with VSMC de-differentiation and remodelling (i.e., the synthetic phenotype, Figure 4). In proliferating cultures of human saphenous vein VSMC (hVSMC), ORAI1 is abundantly expressed and is crucial for SOCE. Where siRNA-induced ORAI1 silencing suppressed SOCE, and this reduction of SOCE was rescued by transfecting cells with ORAI1 cDNA, verifying the role of ORAI1 in SOCE in hVSMC (Li et al., 2011b). Inhibition of SOCE either by siRNA-mediated ORAI1 silencing or pharmacologically using the potent and selective CRAC channel blocker Synta66 (S66) reduced hVSMC migration, with slight reduction of cell proliferation and no effect on cell viability (Li et al., 2011b). Similarly, in human aortic VSMC cultures, impairment of ICRAC via siRNA-mediated ORAI1 silencing significantly hampered cell proliferation (Baryshnikov et al., 2009). Although the secretory behaviour of VSMC plays a crucial role in pathologic ECM remodelling, little is known about the role of ORAI1 in ECM production and secretion in VSMCs.",
        "Diagrammatic illustration of VSMC phenotypic remodelling. (A) VSMC with fully differentiated contractile phenotype features spindle-like elongated morphology, with low proliferation and migratory abilities, and typically shows low ORAI1 and STIM1 expression levels. Fully differentiated cells express VSMC markers including alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA), and gamma smooth muscle actin (γSMA). (B) Upon phenotypic remodelling VSMC with synthetic phenotype acquires enlarged hypertrophic morphology with high proliferation and migratory abilities. Synthetic VSMCs show high ORAI1 and STIM1 expression levels and low expression of αSMA and γSMA VSMC markers.",
        "Whilst ORAI1 is upregulated in synthetic and proliferative VSMC, the L-type voltage gated CaV1.2 channel was downregulated, which is a trend thought to contribute to the loss of the VSMC contractile function in synthetic phenotype (Gollasch et al., 1998; Ihara et al., 2002). CaV1.2 channel blockers in VSMC promote STIM1-induced ORAI1 activation through promoting STIM1 re-localisation to the ER-PM junctions, in CaV1.2 and store-depletion independent fashion, leading to induced VSMC remodelling (Johnson et al., 2020). These findings not only support the implication of ORAI1/STIM1 signalling in VSMC remodelling but also imply the risk of potential aggravation of vascular remodelling by the CaV1.2 channel blockers, which are routinely used anti-hypertensive medications.",
        "PDGF pro-migratory signalling, an essential component in VSMC phenotypic switching (Yamasaki et al., 2001), was shown to activate ORAI1 channels in hVSMC without inducing ORAI1 redistribution in the plasma membrane (McKeown et al., 2012). In agreement with these findings, Ogawa et al. (2012) showed that PDGF induces pulmonary arterial VSMC proliferation through activation of SOCE. Silencing of either Orai1 or Stim1 in cultured rat aortic VSMC disrupted PDGF-induced Ca2+ entry and reduced cell migration, verifying that PDGF mediates its effect in VSMC through the ORAI1/STIM1 signalling pathway (Bisaillon et al., 2010). On the other hand, pharmacological potentiation of ORAI1 channel activity using the ORAI1 enhancer (IA65) was shown to promote the PDGF-induced VSMC migration (Azimi et al., 2020). The pro-migratory and proliferative effect of ORAI1 is thought to be mediated through activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT), which potentially promotes the expression of pro-proliferative factors (e.g., IL6, cyclin A, and cyclin D1), as observed from the reduced NFAT nuclear translocation following silencing of Orai1 or Stim1 in VSMC (Aubart et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011b). Orai1 silencing in primary VSMC isolated from rabbit aorta resulted in reduced DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (Yang et al., 2012a). In cultured rat synthetic VSMC, knockout of either Orai1 or Stim1 reduced cellular proliferative and migratory ability (Potier et al., 2009). Similar results were reported with siRNA-induced silencing of Stim1 in cultured rat VSMC, resulting in reduced cell proliferation and migration. This effect of Stim1 silencing on VSMC proliferation and migration was reversed by re-expression of Stim1 (Guo et al., 2009), demonstrating its vital role in regulating VSMC proliferation. These data highlight the role of ORAI1/STIM1 and SOCE in regulating VSMC switch to a proliferative and migratory phenotype, a process that plays a key role in the aetiology of various vascular pathologies.",
        "In addition to the activation of ORAI1 by PDGF signalling, Urotensin-II-induced VSMC proliferation was mediated through activating SOCE and promoting ORAI1/STIM1 and ORAI1/TRPC interactions (Rodríguez-Moyano et al., 2013). Similar findings were observed by in vitro treatment of human coronary VSMC with angiotensin-II, which stimulated VSMC remodelling to proliferative phenotype, and resulted into ORAI1 upregulation leading to augmented SOCE (Liu et al., 2020). Additionally, the angiotensin-II-stimulated human coronary VSMC (Liu et al., 2020) and rat aortic VSMC (Guo et al., 2011) proliferation was hampered by either ORAI1 or STIM1 silencing. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is another signalling molecule that was shown to induce STIM1 rearrangement, resulting in subsequent activation of ORAI1-mediated SOCE in VSMC. This S1P-triggered activation of SOCE was shown to be higher in synthetic VSMC relative to those with the contractile phenotype, supporting the crucial role ORAI1-mediated SOCE in promoting phenotypic remodelling (Hopson et al., 2011).",
        "The phenotypic modulation of VSMC could lead to their differentiation to an osteoblast-like cells, which is characterised by the expression of osteogenic markers and secretion of calcified matrix, a process known as vascular calcification. This osteogenic differentiation of VSMC is a key player in vascular calcification that can lead to vascular stiffness and atherosclerotic plaque rapture (Durham et al., 2018). ORAI1 has been reported to play a role in this osteogenic reprogramming of human aortic VSMC and vascular calcification. For example, in vitro induction of the osteogenic signalling in human aortic VSMC by β-glycerophosphate exposure, as a phosphate donor, or by high extracellular glucose treatment resulted in an upregulation of ORAI1 and STIM1 levels, and this effect on vascular osteogenic signalling was suppressed by ORAI1 silencing or pharmacological inhibition (Ma et al., 2019, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020).",
        "Mutations in the ORAI1 gene have been reported in a range of diseases (Figure 3 and Tables 1, 2), including: tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM), SCID, congenital miosis, ectodermal dysplasia anhidrosis (EDA), and Stormorken-like syndrome (Böhm et al., 2017; Garibaldi et al., 2017). The clinical manifestation of ORAI1 deficiency is mainly immunodeficiency, global muscular hypotonia, and defects in dental enamel calcification (Table 1; Feske et al., 2006; McCarl et al., 2009; Badran et al., 2016; Lian et al., 2018). Of interest to the present study however, neo-vascularisation of the cornea was observed in a patient with compound heterozygous missense mutations 308C>A (A103E) and 581T > C (L194P) in the ORAI1 gene (McCarl et al., 2009). There is also a growing body of evidence linking upregulation of ORAI1 in a wide range of important human diseases from cancer to heart failure. The implication of ORAI1 in human cardiovascular abnormalities was highlighted by the reported association of ORAI1 mutations with Kawasaki disease (KD) susceptibility, which is the leading cause of cardiovascular complications during childhood. These studies have identified rare missense variants in KD patients (Onouchi et al., 2016; Thiha et al., 2019). The reported variants in KD patients, interestingly, include a variant that cause p.Gly98Asp mutation within the TM1 domain that generates the ion conduction pore, which is a mutation known to lead to a constitutive ORAI1 channel activation (Zhang et al., 2011a). These findings signify the potential involvement of ORAI1-mediated signalling in cardiovascular pathologies.",

        "The key role of ORAI1/STIM1 signalling in promoting migration and proliferation of cultured VSMC was supported by in vivo studies, where STIM1 (Aubart et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2009) and ORAI1 (Bisaillon et al., 2010) levels were elevated in injured rat carotid arteries following balloon angioplasty, relative to uninjured arteries. Similar elevation of ORAI1 and STIM1 was observed in the intimal hyperplastic lesion in mouse carotid arteries following carotid ligation (Zhang et al., 2011b), and an increased expression of ORAI1 and STIM1 in neointimal VSMC was associated with elevated expression of proliferation markers (Zhang et al., 2011b). Formation of NIH following balloon angioplasty and the expression level of proliferation markers were significantly reduced by either Stim1 knockdown (Aubart et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2009) or Orai1 knockdown (Zhang et al., 2011b) induced by viral delivery of siRNA or short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) in rats, respectively, supporting the in vivo role of ORAI1 and STIM1 in the pathogenesis of NIH.",
        "It was also shown that angiotensin-II, which is a driver of VSMC remodelling, promotes ORAI1 and STIM1 expression in rat carotid arteries after balloon angioplasty, and that silencing of either Orai1 or Stim1 reduced the angiotensin-II-promoted NIH formation in injured rat carotids (Guo et al., 2011). In support, Mancarella et al. (2013) studied the role of STIM1 in SMC function via targeted deletion of Stim1 specifically in murine smooth muscle tissues using Cre-Lox technology. This murine model was carrying the cre-recombinase transgene under the control of the SM22α smooth muscle-specific promoter that enabled the deletion of Stim1 in the different smooth muscle tissues. This lack of Stim1 in smooth muscle tissues resulted in abnormal development and impaired contractile response in intestinal and vascular smooth muscles. Development of NIH following carotid artery ligation was shown to be significantly reduced in mice with Stim1 SMC-specific conditional deletion relative to controls (Mancarella et al., 2013). This study emphasises the role of STIM1 in the formation of NIH. Nonetheless, the reported involvement of STIM1 in NIH does not necessarily indicate similar contribution of ORAI1, due to the multiple pathways and channels involving STIM1 activation.",
        "ORAI1 has been shown to directly interact with various proteins implicated in NIH formation, including members of TRPC family. TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6 were shown to have a role in modulating VSMC proliferation and formation of NIH (Kumar et al., 2006; Jia et al., 2017). Nonetheless, little is known about the potential involvement of ORAI1/TRPC complexes in promoting VSMC proliferation. HOMER1 is a scaffolding protein that has been shown to be able to interact with ORAI1 and a number of TRPC channels. ORAI1 interaction with HOMER1 was shown to be enhanced in VSMC following balloon-injury of carotid arteries, relative to uninjured arteries (Jia et al., 2017). Interestingly, Homer1 silencing in rat aortic proliferative VSMC resulted in reduction of SOCE, VSMC proliferation, and migration, implying the involvement of ORAI1/HOMER1 interaction in modulating VSMC phenotypic remodelling (Jia et al., 2017).",
        "ORAI1 expression was reported to be elevated in atherosclerotic lesions of Apolipoprotein-E null (ApoE–/–) mice on a high-cholesterol diet. In vivo silencing of Orai1 using viral delivery of siRNA against Orai1 or pharmacological inhibition of ORAI1, using an inhibitor with poor specificity, reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in ApoE–/– mice fed high-cholesterol diet (Liang et al., 2016). ORAI1-mediated SOCE was shown to be essential for the formation of foam cells, which are macrophages loaded with low-density lipoproteins, a critical step in atherogenesis. Orai1-knockdown macrophages exhibited remarkable reduction in their ability to bind and uptake lipoproteins, which subsequently reduced foam cell formation, and atherosclerotic plaque formation (Liang et al., 2016).",
        "Inflammation and cytokine secretion are also major components of the development of atherosclerosis and NIH. Inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions is mediated by pro-inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) cells that secrete inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (Frostegard et al., 1999), which in turn induces macrophage activation and promotes intimal thickening through the promotion of growth factor-induced mitogenesis in VSMC (Ferns et al., 1991; Yokota et al., 1992; Tellides et al., 2000). Knockdown of leukotriene-C4 synthase, which produces the pro-inflammatory mediator leukotriene-C4, and activates ORAI1/ORAI3 channels in VSMC, suppressed neointimal formation in balloon-injured rat carotid artery (Zhang et al., 2015). Furthermore, the emerging role of ORAI1 in lipid metabolism suggests potential involvement of ORAI1 in lipid deposition in atherosclerotic plaque. Maus et al. (2017) revealed that the absence of SOCE due to ORAI1 or STIM1/STIM2 disruption resulted in increased deposition of lipid droplets in murine liver, skeletal muscle, and heart muscle. Additionally, TAM patients with ORAI1 loss-of-function p.Gly98Arg mutation showed deposition of lipid droplets in skeletal muscles, and increased lipid content in patient fibroblasts relative to healthy donors, due to impaired lipolysis (Maus et al., 2017). SOCE was shown to modulate the expression of key enzymes involved in the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, and regulate the expression of neutral lipases and a number of transcription regulators that modulate lipolysis (Maus et al., 2017). This is in accord with the previously reported reduction of SOCE associated with lipid accumulation in rat liver cells (Wilson et al., 2015). The involvement of ORAI1 in lipid metabolism foreshadows its potential role in pathogenic mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis, including lipid deposition and formation of the fatty streak.",
        "The ORAI1/ORAI3 ARC store-independent channel was reported to be activated in VSMC after thrombin-mediated induced phenotypic remodelling (González-Cobos et al., 2013). Platelet activation contributes to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis (Methia et al., 2001; Pratico et al., 2001; Massberg et al., 2002) and platelet adhesion to vascular endothelium was observed before the development of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE–/– mice (Massberg et al., 2002). Defective SOCE in both Orai1–/– or Stim1–/– mice resulted in impaired platelet activation and thrombus formation (Varga-Szabo et al., 2008; Braun et al., 2009). Similarly, introduction of a SNP in the EF-hand of murine STIM1 impaired its activation in response to ER Ca2+ deletion and resulted in macrothrombocytopenia and impaired platelet activation (Grosse et al., 2007). Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in STIM1 were observed in patients with York Platelet syndrome (Markello et al., 2015) and thrombocytopenia (Nesin et al., 2014). Impaired platelet function was also observed in patients with ORAI1 mutations (Table 1; Nagy et al., 2018). The involvement of ORAI1-mediated SOCE in normal platelet function implies the potential involvement of ORAI1 abnormalities in platelet activation and adhesion in atherosclerosis.",
        "The link between SOCE and vascular remodelling rendered CRAC channels as promising therapeutic targets. Newly identified inhibitors of SOCE have increased understanding of the physiological roles of SOCE and emerged as attractive candidates with the potential to enable pharmacological modulation of CRAC channels. Nonetheless, many of these agents have indefinite mechanism of action and those with the specificity to distinguish between different Ca2+ channels remains elusive (Table 3).",
        "Features of ORAI1 channel pharmacological inhibitors.",
        "Lanthanides (Gd3+ and La3+) are widely studied potent inhibitors of CRAC channels, which block SOCE at the nanomolar concentration range. At a concentration of 5 μM, Gd3+ was reported to block SOCE in rat synthetic VSMC and in the A7R5 VSMC line (Potier et al., 2009). Sensitivity to inhibition by lanthanides is a key feature of CRAC currents that differentiate CRAC channels from other Ca2+ channels. Gd3+ is equipotent toward the three ORAI homologs, ORAI1, ORAI2, and ORAI3 (Zhang et al., 2020). Despite the high potency of lanthanides, their efficiency as CRAC channel inhibitors is limited by their high plasma protein binding affinity, low solubility in presence of other multivalent ions, and their limited specificity as CRAC channel inhibitors at higher concentration (Figure 5). At concentrations more than 1 μM, lanthanides inhibit activity of voltage-gated calcium ion channels (Reichling and MacDermott, 1991), and TRPC channels (Halaszovich et al., 2000; Trebak et al., 2002). It is thought that lanthanides exhibit their activity as CRAC channel blockers through binding to acidic residues on the extracellular loop of ORAI1, rather than competing for the Ca2+ binding sites within the ion conduction pore of the channel. In support of this theory, the ability of Gd3+ to inhibit CRAC channel activity was significantly reduced in cells expressing mutant ORAI1 gene carrying charge-neutralising mutations of aspartate (D) residues within the TM1-TM2 extracellular loop of ORAI1 (Yeromin et al., 2006). Similarly, McNally et al. (2009) showed that mutations of acidic residues in the human ORAI1 gene at either of Q108, D110, D112, or D114 of the TM1-TM2 loop reduced the potency of La3+ inhibition. However, mutation at position 106, which serves as the ion selectivity filter and is located within TM1 domain that generates the central ion conduction pore, did not affect the ability of La3+ to inhibit the channel activity. These observations suggest that lanthanides bind to residues at the extracellular TM1-TM2 loop, rather than binding deeper in the ion conduction pore of ORAI1 channels (McNally et al., 2009).",

        "Imidazole antimycotic drugs including SKF-96365 (Figure 5), econazole and miconazole were shown to inhibit ICRAC in a wide range of cell types. SKF-96365 was first identified in Ca2+ signalling studies as an inhibitor of receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx, with inhibitory effect in the micromolar range in platelets, neutrophils and endothelial cells (Merritt et al., 1990; Franzius et al., 1994). It was also shown to inhibit SOCE in Jurkat T cells (Chung et al., 1994). In a mouse model of atherosclerosis, in vivo administration of SKF-96365 remarkably reduced atherosclerotic plaque development (Liang et al., 2016). Nonetheless, the observed effect is not necessary attributed to SOCE inhibition. A wide spectrum of ion channels were reported to be targeted by SKF-96365, including receptor- and store-operated TRPC channels, voltage gated Ca2+ channels (Merritt et al., 1990; Singh et al., 2010), voltage gated sodium channels (Chen et al., 2015), and ATP sensitive potassium channels (KATP) (Tanahashi et al., 2016). Furthermore, earlier studies reported that SKF-96365 not only acts as an ion influx inhibitor, micromolar concentrations of SKF-96365 also inhibited ER Ca2+ pumps in human endothelial cells (Iouzalen et al., 1996), and activated reverse operation of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) resulting in Ca2+ uptake and sustained intracellular Ca2+ elevation in cancer cells (Song et al., 2014). SKF-96365 has served as a powerful tool to characterise mechanisms of Ca2+ entry, however, the multiple targets of SKF-96365 could hinder its use as ICRAC inhibitor and limit its translation toward potential therapies. Analogues of SKF-96365 were reported to have higher potency in inhibiting SOCE in B lymphocyte cells; however, further studies are still needed to assess their specificity (Dago et al., 2018).",
        "Carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) (Figure 5) was identified as a Ca2+ influx inhibitor, showing antiproliferative and antimetastatic effects in multiple cancer cell lines and in vivo xenograft models (Kohn and Liotta, 1990; Hupe et al., 1991; Kohn et al., 1992; Wasilenko et al., 1996; Wu et al., 1997). Its anticancer activity has been linked to inhibition of SOCE, but investigations have been complicated by it being a general inhibitor of non-voltage gated calcium influx (Enfissi et al., 2004). Whilst most research on CAI has focused on its anticancer effects, it has also shown promise in other fields. Through a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines, CAI has shown benefits in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis (Zhu et al., 2015) and a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (Guo et al., 2012), although the exact molecular mechanism was not known. There is also much evidence for CAI as an anti-angiogenic agent in cancer (Luzzi et al., 1998; Bauer et al., 2000; Faehling et al., 2002) and retinal neovascularisation (Afzal et al., 2010), although it does not appear to have been investigated for pathological vascular remodelling.",
        "2-Aminoethyldiphenyl Borate (2-APB) is one of the most thoroughly studied SOCE inhibitors (Figure 5). It was initially thought to have inhibitory effect on Ca2+ signalling through being a membrane permeable IP3 receptor-antagonist (Maruyama et al., 1997; Missiaen et al., 2001), and was also reported to be associated with store-operated Ca2+ channel inhibition; nonetheless, this inhibition was interpreted as a potential consequence of IP3 receptor inhibition (Ma et al., 2000). Then, Gregory et al. (2001) showed via whole-cell patch-clamp analysis of rat hepatoma cells that 2-APB inhibited inward Ca2+ current induced by IP3, implying that 2-APB could be acting as a blocker of SOCE. This finding was further supported by the ability of 2-APB to block SOCE in IP3 receptor-knockout cells, and the observed more potent inhibition when applied extracellularly relative to intracellularly (Bakowski et al., 2001; Ma et al., 2001; Prakriya and Lewis, 2001). It was reported that this inhibitory effect is mediated via enhancing STIM1 intramolecular interactions, which subsequently maintain STIM1 at its resting state, as well as a potential direct inhibition of ORAI1 as shown by the observed 2-APB inhibition of SOCE in a STIM-independent constitutively active ORAI1 mutant (Wei et al., 2016). Interestingly, 2-APB was shown to exhibit a bimodal effect on SOCE, in which low concentrations (1–5 μM) promote SOCE, while higher ones (more than 10 μM) have a strong inhibitory effect (Prakriya and Lewis, 2001). Besides the inhibition of ORAI1, 2-APB at 50 μM concentration showed weak inhibitory effect of ORAI2, and significantly potentiated the activity of ORAI3 channels in a store-independent manner (Lis et al., 2007; Peinelt et al., 2008). 2-APB was also shown to inhibit SERCA pumps (Bilmen et al., 2002; Peppiatt et al., 2003) and to modulate the activity of members of the TRP channel superfamily, including members of TRPM subfamily, TRPM6, TRPM7 (Li et al., 2006) and TRPM8 (Hu et al., 2004), TRPV subfamily, TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3 (Hu et al., 2004) and members of TRPC subfamily, TRPC3 (Trebak et al., 2002) and TRPC6 (Hu et al., 2004). Its multiple targets and limited specificity promoted the need to develop analogues of 2-APB with improved selectivity and potency. Zhou et al. (2007), assessed the potency of 166 2-APB analogues and two analogues (DPB025 and DPB083) were identified to have higher specificity to SOCE inhibition relative to that of 2-APB. Additionally, analogues including DPB161-AE, DPB163, and DPB162-AE that are around 100-fold more potent than 2-APB itself were identified (Zhou et al., 2007; Goto et al., 2010). It was, however, shown that the effect of DPB162-AE on Ca2+ signalling is not limited to inhibition of CRAC channels, but also induced Ca2+ leak from the ER resulting in Ca2+ store depletion without inhibiting SERCA pumps (Bittremieux et al., 2017). The mechanisms underlying the diverse effects of 2-APB and its analogues on SOCE remain poorly understood and more studies are still need to clarify their mechanism of action. Due to its wide range of protein targets, various clinically relevant biological effects have been observed and recently reviewed, including immunomodulatory, anti-cancer, neuroprotective, and in the GI system (Rosalez et al., 2020). Of relevance to CVD, 2-APB has been studied and shown benefits in models of atherosclerosis (Ewart et al., 2017; Simo-Cheyou et al., 2017), hypertension (Bencze et al., 2015), and vascular calcification (Lee et al., 2020), although these effects have mostly been attributed to its effects on TRP channels or the IP3 receptor.",
        "YM-58483, also known as bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole-2 (BTP2 or Pyr2) (Figure 5), is a pyrazole derivative that was identified as an ICRAC blocker with an IC50 of 10–100 nM in Jurkat T cells (Ishikawa et al., 2003; Zitt et al., 2004). YM-58483-mediated ICRAC inhibition resulted in reduced T cell activation, and proliferation, as well as reduced cytokine production. It exhibits higher specificity in inhibiting CRAC channels over voltage gated Ca2+ channels, without off-target effects observed on ER Ca2+ pumps or potassium channels. Despite its remarkable potency, its inhibitory effect on ICRAC is limited by the long incubation time that is needed to achieve this high potency, with around 75% inhibition of ICRAC achieved within 2 h of incubation with Jurkat T cells (Zitt et al., 2004). The inhibitory effect of YM-58483 was only observed when applied extracellularly implying that it probably interacts with the extracellular side of CRAC channels (Zitt et al., 2004). In contrast, others suggested that YM-58483 inhibits ICRAC through binding to an actin reorganisation protein, Drebrin, and thus disrupting actin cytoskeleton (Mercer et al., 2010). Besides inhibiting CRAC channels, YM-58483 was shown to promote the activity of TRPM4 channels at low nanomolar concentrations (Takezawa et al., 2006) and inhibit the activity of number of TRPC channels, including TRPC3, and TRPC5 (He et al., 2005). It has mostly been studied for its effects in inflammatory disease, including asthma and rheumatoid arthritis (Yoshino et al., 2007; Miyoshi et al., 2018; Sogkas et al., 2018), as well as pain and neurology (Qi et al., 2016; Orem et al., 2020). Of relevance to vascular pathology, YM-58483 and SKF-96365 have been used to characterise SOCE in models of diabetic vasculopathy, in which SOCE is reduced compared to non-diabetic VSMCs (Schach et al., 2020).",
        "GSK7975A, GSK5503A, and GSK5498A are pyrazole derivatives developed by GlaxoSmithKline for inflammatory and immune disorders. GSK5498A was reported to inhibit ICRAC at IC50 of around 1 μM in HEK293 co-expressing STIM1 and ORAI1 (Ashmole et al., 2012). GSK7975A was shown to be effective in models of acute pancreatitis (Gerasimenko et al., 2013; Voronina et al., 2015). GSK7975A and GSK5503A were shown to have similar inhibitory effects on ICRAC. Similar to the earlier pyrazole derivative YM-58483, GSK7975A, and GSK5503A showed slow onset of ICRAC inhibition. GSK7975A inhibits both ORAI1 and ORAI3 at similar IC50 of around 4 μM in HEK293 cells expressing STIM1, as well as ORAI1 or ORAI3 (Derler et al., 2013). It was also reported that GSK7975A largely inhibits both ORAI1 and ORAI2, with less inhibitory effect against ORAI3 (Zhang et al., 2020). Its inhibitory effect was suggested to be mediated through direct interaction with ORAI1 channel, without affecting STIM1 oligomerisation or ORAI1-STIM1 interactions (Derler et al., 2013). This inhibitory effect was significantly reduced in cells expressing pore mutant ORAI1, relative to those expressing wildtype ORAI1, suggesting mechanism of inhibition via altering the pore geometry of ORAI1 channels (Derler et al., 2013). GSK7975A showed partial inhibition of the activity of L-type Ca2+ channels, and blocked TRPV6 channel activity. Failure to differentiate between ORAI1 and ORAI3 channels, as well as inhibition of L-type Ca2+, and TRPV6 channels, limit its specificity as an ORAI1 channel blocker.",
        "Synta66 (S66) (Figure 5) is an ICRAC inhibitor showing an inhibitory effect in the micromolar concentration range. A lack of off-target effects on the inwardly rectifying K+ current or Ca2+ pumps suggested selectivity against ICRAC (Ng et al., 2008). Its remarkable selectivity was then revealed by radioligand binding assays and functional assays which showed that S66 did not affect the activity of wide spectrum of receptors, and ion channels, including voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and Na+ channels (Di Sabatino et al., 2009). In support, Li et al. (2011b) showed that S66 did not affect STIM1 aggregation, or the activity of TRPC5 channels, TRPC1/5 channels, or even the store operated non-selective cationic current. S66 showed remarkable inhibition of ORAI1 activity, whereas it showed only minimal activation of ORAI2 and inhibition of ORAI3 in HEK293 cells that lacked the three native ORAI homologs and expressed a specific individual ORAI homolog along with STIM1 (Zhang et al., 2020). Computational docking simulations have shown that S66 potentially binds to the extracellular loop 1 and 3 regions of ORAI1, which are regions at close proximity to the selectivity filter. The inhibitory effect of S66 was also shown to be weakened in cells expressing ORAI1 mutations affecting the channel selectivity. This was demonstrated by the impaired S66-mediated SOCE inhibition by the ORAI1 mutation (E106D) within the region that encodes for the glutamate residues that form the channel selectivity filter. Similar impairment of the S66 inhibitory effect was observed with other ORAI1 mutations that result into non-selective currents, like the mutant ORAI1 that carries mutations within its extracellular loop1 or loop 3 regions (Waldherr et al., 2020). S66 is a potent inhibitor of SOCE in VSMCs isolated from human saphenous veins with an IC50 of around 26 nM and resulted in significant reduction of VSMC migration (Li et al., 2011b). It has also been found to inhibit endothelial cell migration and tube formation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo (Li et al., 2011a). Interestingly, S66 showed remarkably higher potency in inhibiting ICRAC in VSMC than its reported potency in the RBL cells (Ng et al., 2008), Jurkat T cell (Di Sabatino et al., 2009), and in leucocytes (Li et al., 2011b). The high potency of S66 in VSMC relative to other cell types raises the promise to selectively modulate CRAC channels in VSMC, and to enable targeting vascular remodelling. Nonetheless, the lack of information regarding the mechanisms underlying S66-induced ICRAC inhibition and its poor aqueous solubility render it far from being translated into therapies.",
        "RO2959 was developed by Roche as a CRAC channel blocker that is effective in the nanomolar concentration range. It showed higher selectivity for ORAI1 inhibition over ORAI2 and ORAI3. It was screened against a range of ion channels, but showed no off-target effects on voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, Na+, K+ channels, members of TRPC or TRPM channels, indicating specificity in inhibiting ORAI1 channels. It was also screened against cell receptors and transporters and two receptors were considered to be inhibited by RO2959, which are the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B (5-HT2B) and the peripheral benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors, showing 87 and 89% inhibition, respectively, at 3 μM concentration of RO2959 (Chen et al., 2013). RO2959-mediated ICRAC inhibition in human CD4+ T cells resulted in reduction of cell proliferation and cytokine production, signifying the role of ICRAC in T cell function (Chen et al., 2013). Nevertheless, the mechanism of action of RO2959 remains elusive.",
        "AnCoA4 was discovered by a commercial small molecule microarray of 12,000 compounds (Sadaghiani et al., 2014). Rather than screening against whole cells, this technique uses minimal functional domains, which are purified isolated domains of ORAI1 and STIM1 known to be vital for SOCE. This is to allow only small molecules that directly bind to ORAI1 or STIM1 to be identified as hits, avoiding those that indirectly affect SOCE. AnCoA4, at 20 μM concentration, showed 80% inhibition of SOCE in HEK293 cells co-expressing STIM1 and ORAI1. A binding site for AnCoA4 on the C-terminus of ORAI1 was proposed, using a fluorescence aggregation assay, surface plasmon resonance and the FRED docking algorithm. AnCoA4 was also found to inhibit the ORAI1/STIM1 interaction, on the C-terminus, and to compete with STIM1 for ORAI1 binding, supporting the binding region prediction (Sadaghiani et al., 2014).",
        "The 7-azaindole series of SOCE inhibitors was developed based on the structures of YM-58483 and Synta-66, a series of 7-azaindole SOCE inhibitors were developed for inflammatory respiratory diseases. Lead compound (14 d) inhibited SOCE with an IC50 of 150 ± 22 nM in Jurkat T cells, and its administration in a rat model of allergic respiratory inflammation was associated with a dose-dependent inhibition of eosinophils, showing promise as a therapeutic strategy (Esteve et al., 2015).",
        "The indazole-3-carboxamide series was also developed as anti-inflammatory compounds, and shows moderate SOCE inhibition, with lead compound (12 d) showing dose-dependent inhibition of mast cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in the range of 0.28–1.60 μM IC50 in RBL-2H3 cells (Bai et al., 2017). In this series, the “reverse” amide bond isomers were found to have significantly reduced activity, with most only inhibiting at >100 μM. This effect has not been reported in any other ORAI1 inhibitors, and most of those containing amide bonds are in reverse to 12 d (YM-58483, Synta-66, RO2959, GSK series, CalciMedica series). Compound (12 d) has also been developed into an indole derivative, MCS-01, which inhibits Ca2+ influx at 1.6 μM and is being developed as a topical mast cell stabilising treatment to improve diabetic wound healing (Tellechea et al., 2020).",
        "Leflunomide and teriflunomide were identified as weakly potent ORAI1 inhibitors alongside several other FDA-approved drugs (Rahman and Rahman, 2017). Leflunomide is used clinically as a dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase inhibitor to treat rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis; teriflunomide was later approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (Fragoso and Brooks, 2015). These were identified in a virtual ligand-based screen for 3D shape and electrostatics using the structures of Synta66, AnCoA4, YM-58483 and its analogue Pyr6 as bait. Leflunomide and its active metabolite teriflunomide were identified as being able to inhibit SOCE at clinically relevant concentrations, with IC50 of around 10 μM for leflunomide and 21 μM for teriflunomide.",
        "CM4620 is a small-molecule ORAI1 inhibitor developed by CalciMedica, which has shown potent inhibition of ORAI1 activity with IC50 of 119 nM and a less potent effect against ORAI2 channels with an IC50 of 895 nM (CalciMedica, 2016). CM4620 was showed to be effective in reducing the severity of acute pancreatitis in pre-clinical models (Waldron et al., 2019), and reached clinical trials for acute pancreatitis and is currently being tested in Phase II clinical trials for use in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (Miller et al., 2020). These ongoing clinical trials emphasise the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ORAI1 inhibitors in patients and highlights the promising potential of using ORAI1 inhibition as new therapies. An older compound, CM3457, has shown inhibition of various interleukins and other immune functions in different cell lines (Ramos et al., 2012). It was also shown to be selective over a small panel of potassium, sodium and calcium channels, mostly those involved in cardiac function, and is effective in rat models of arthritis and asthma (Ramos et al., 2012).",
        "The pyrtriazole series has been developed as an anti-inflammatory SOCE inhibitors based on the structures of the Pyr family of compounds. Lead Pyrtriazole compound (39) showed an IC50 of 4.4 μM for SOCE inhibition in HEK293 cells and was reported to be selective for SOCE over voltage gated Ca2+ channels, TRPV1 and TRPM8, although an analogue was found to activate TRPV1. Pyrtriazole 39 was taken into a mouse model of acute pancreatitis and found to reduce oedema, inflammation and apoptosis, all hallmarks of pancreatitis. This series also contains two compounds which were unexpectedly found to be SOCE activators, activating the channel at 198–236% entry and 142–197% entry at 10 μM in three different cell lines (Riva et al., 2018).",
        "Rhizen Pharmaceuticals have developed inhibitors of SOCE for the treatment of cancers, two of which have reached clinical trials. RP3128 is orally active and effective in a guinea pig model of asthma (Vakkalanka et al., 2013; Sutovska et al., 2016), and was taken into a Phase I dose escalation safety study (Barde et al., 2020). Another compound, RP4010, has been investigated for esophageal squamous cell cancer and is potent and effective in several cancer cell lines and in xenograft mouse models (Cui et al., 2018). It required around 2 h to demonstrate maximal inhibition of SOCE, and so may have an indirect effect on the channel rather than directly blocking ORAI1 (Cui et al., 2018). It was entered into Phase I safety studies for the treatment of relapsed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but the trial has been terminated, because of pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety reasons (US National Library of Medicine, 2017).",
        "JPIII (4-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(pyridin-4-yl)methyl] aniline) is a novel analogue of S66 that we have recently identified as a potent ORAI1 inhibitor with sufficiently improved pharmacokinetics compared to S66 (Bartoli et al., 2020). JPIII showed potent inhibitory effects of SOCE at the nanomolar range, with IC50 of 399 nM in HEK293 cells. Besides its potency, JPIII also showed remarkable selectivity against ORAI1, and did not affect the activity of ORAI3, TRPC5, TRPC6, TRPC4, TRPC5, TRPM2, or hERG channels. It also showed high efficacy, without any obvious side-effects when administered in vivo in murine models (Bartoli et al., 2020). The high potency at the target, the selectivity, the improved pharmacokinetics compared to S66, which is limited by its poor aqueous solubility, as well as the in vivo safety and efficacy in pre-clinical models highlight the great potential of JPIII to be used as an in vivo tool to study the effects of ORAI1 inhibition on VSMC biology. It is, however, limited by lack of information about the mechanism by which it inhibits ORAI1 activity.",
        "These ORAI1 channel inhibitors are valuable tools to study the role of SOCE in health and disease, and paves the way for the development of therapeutic ORAI1 inhibitors that target pathologic remodelling. The reported implications of ORAI1-mediated signalling in VSMC phenotypic switching and in vascular pathologies highlight the therapeutic promise of ORAI1-targeted approaches. This is further supported by the role of ORAI1 in immune cell function, inflammation, and lipid homeostasis, which are key components in the development of atherosclerosis and NIH. A number of pharmacological inhibitors have now reached clinical trials for severe plaque psoriasis, acute pancreatitis, asthma and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated severe pneumonia (Stauderman, 2018; Miller et al., 2020), which highlights the therapeutic potential of the ORAI1 channel inhibitors and the tolerability of the ORAI1 inhibitors in patients. Activators of ORAI1 activity, as shown in the recently developed enhancer of ORAI1 activity, IA65 (Azimi et al., 2020), could also be useful tools to help further define the role of ORAI1 in pathophysiology.",
        "Understanding the nature of ORAI1 involvement in health and diseases holds promise to allow fine-tuning of VSMC phenotypic remodelling to its normal physiological levels. The nature of ORAI1 involvement in vascular development, angiogenesis, vascular physiology and vascular diseases is still unclear. This could be attributed to lack of information regarding ORAI1 dysregulation in adults, because of the early mortality associated with ORAI1 mutations, as well as the perinatal lethality of ORAI1 deletion in animal models. Further studies are still needed to elucidate the role of ORAI1 in vascular development, physiology and diseases, as well as the in vivo consequences that could be associated with ORAI1 inhibition or over-activation in VSMC. The rapidly increasing knowledge of the implications of ORAI1 signalling in vascular remodelling holds promise to generate novel therapeutic tools for atherosclerosis and to prevent NIH following endovascular intervention.",

At least one adverse drug reaction was reported by 115 (93%) patients receiving MTX, but the majority did not require permanent drug discontinuation. Although the prevalence of adverse reactions increased with longer duration of therapy, no differences existed in the type of reactions reported over 5 years of treatment.

      "title": "Risk Factors Associated with Adverse Events Leading to Methotrexate Withdrawal in Elderly Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study",
      "abstract": "Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in elderly population represents a challenge for physicians in terms of therapeutic management. Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line treatment among conventional synthetic-disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cs-DMARDs); however, it is often associated with adverse events (AEs). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the incidence and risk factors of MTX discontinuation due to AEs in elderly patients with RA in a long-term retrospective cohort study. Methods: Clinical sheets from elderly RA patients taking MTX from an outpatient rheumatology consult in a university centre were reviewed. To assess MTX persistence, we used Kaplan–Meir curves and Cox regression models to identify the risk of withdrawing MTX due to adverse events. Results: In total, 198 elderly RA patients who reported using MTX were included. Of them, the rates of definitive suspension of MTX due to AEs were 23.0% at 5 years, 35.6% at 10 years and 51.7% at 15 years. The main organs and system involved were gastrointestinal (15.7%) and mucocutaneous (3.0%). Factors associated with withdrawing MTX due to AEs were MTX dose ≥ 15 mg/wk (adjusted HR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.22–4.96, p = 0.012); instead, the folic acid supplementation was protective for withdrawal (adjusted HR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.16–0.49, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Higher doses of MTX increase the risk of withdrawals in elderly RA, while folic acid supplementation reduces the risk. Therefore, physicians working in therapeutic management for elderly patients using MTX must focus on using lower MTX doses together with the concomitant prescription of folic acid.",

        "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects synovial joints, causing chronic pain, bone erosions and disability [1]. The RA prevalence ranges from 0.5 to 1% worldwide [2]. Early onset of pharmacological treatment with conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cs-DMARDs), constitutes the corner stone of the therapy directed to control the disease activity and decrease the progression of the disease. Methotrexate (MTX) is the synthetic DMARD prescribed as the first line of treatment [3,4]. MTX is a folic acid analog which exerts its therapeutic effects by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), leading to decreased levels of tetrahydrofolate (THF), a vital component in purine synthesis. This depletion of purine nucleotides, including aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICART), disrupts the synthesis of purines, crucial for cell proliferation. Consequently, methotrexate impedes the hyperactive immune response characteristic of RA, reducing inflammation and joint damage [5]. In many countries, including Mexico, MTX is the cs-DMARD most often prescribed to treat RA in around 70% of the patients [6]. However, most of the patients using MTX correspond to persons between the 4th and 5th decade of life and the information derived from using this drug in elderly patients is still limited, while in non-elderly RA patients, there is a wide variability in the time of using MTX [7,8,9,10,11]. The lack of persistence is one of the main factors that limits the effectiveness of MTX, and frequently, the withdrawals of the drug are caused by adverse events (AEs), which, depending on their severity, can lead to treatment discontinuation, from causing distress for the patient (mild) to more serious health complications (severe) [12]. Various factors associated with AEs that lead to MTX discontinuation have been investigated: increased body mass index (BMI) [13], higher pain perception [13], increased ALT levels [13], MTX dose [14], disease duration [14], lack of folate supplementation [14], age [14,15], sex [15], etc.",
        "The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the global population aged 60 years and older will nearly double. [16]. The presence of RA in elderly individuals is an important challenge for rheumatologists, internal medicine specialists and primary-care physicians. Studies performed in outpatient rheumatology clinics indicate that at least 20% of the patients with RA are older than 60 years [17]. However, the literature regarding the behavior of MTX and other drugs in this population is scarce. To date, there are few studies that have assessed MTX withdrawal due to adverse events in the elderly RA population during long-term therapy. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors for withdrawals of MTX due to adverse events in elderly patients with RA in a long-term retrospective cohort study.",
        "Study design: retrospective cohort study. Three trained researchers performed a systematic assessment of clinical charts from elderly patients with RA from a 1000-patient cohort study who attended an outpatient rheumatology consultation therapeutic university centre from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2016. The referred center mostly accommodates patients from Jalisco state in Mexico. The study was performed from September 2021 to January 2023.",
        "We included patients with RA diagnosed by a rheumatologist meeting the American Rheumatism Association 1987 revised criteria for RA [18]. These patients were ≥60 years old at the time of the first consult with the rheumatologist, were prescribed oral MTX for treating the joint manifestations of RA and had more than one visit to the rheumatologist for clinical assessment of evolution and response to treatment.",
        "Patients with only one clinical visit were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were if at the baseline patients had any of the following conditions: cancer, chronic kidney disease (stage 3B or higher), liver diseases, hepatic insufficiency, active infectious diseases, untreated immunodeficiency, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, recent vaccination or hypersensitivity, alongside patients with overlapping syndrome (presence of RA plus symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic scleroderma, and polymyositis).",
        "This study was approved by the following committees: Ethics in Research committee (CEI-CUCS) and Committee of Research (CI-CUCS) at the University Centre of Health Sciences (CUCS), University of Guadalajara, approval code CI-04021. This research protocol followed the Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects described in the Helsinki Declaration [19].",
        "Demographic and clinical data were ascertained by three trained researchers who reviewed elderly RA patients’ clinical charts who attended the public hospital.

Therefore, 198 elderly RA patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study.",
        "Table 1 describes the sociodemographic and disease characteristics of the 198 elderly RA patients included in this study. Most of them were females (84.8%), with a mean age of 66.8 ± 5.6 years. The median RA disease duration was 1 year at the cohort onset, and 40.9% had a positive rheumatoid factor (RF).

After 10 years, only 44 patients remained in the cohort; 29.5% patients used monotherapy with MTX and 70.5% combined therapy, the most used combination being MTX plus SSZ (22.7%). At 15 years, only 12 patients remained in the study; 30.6% were using MTX monotherapy and 55.1% combined therapy, with MTX plus SSZ (24.5%) as the most frequent combination of cs-DMARDs.",

For the adverse events motivating definitive suspension of MTX, for 54 (27.3%), the main organs/systems involved were gastrointestinal (15.7%), mucocutaneous (3.0%), hepatic (2.5%) and constitutional symptoms (2.0%). In data that are not shown in tables, 16 patients (29.6%) had severe adverse events, such as: transaminasemia, bleeding diverticulitis and upper digestive tract bleeding, interstitial pneumopathy and/or pulmonary fibrosis, and severe infections.",

Density incidence of MTX suspension caused by adverse events was 0.040 per 1000 person-years. Figure 1 shows Kaplan–Meier survival curves of the time to MTX withdrawal, in which the cumulative incidence of MTX suspension was 23.0% after 5 years, 35.6% after 10 years and 51.7% after 15 years.",
        "Table 4 shows a comparison of variables observed at baseline between patients who discontinued MTX with those who continued MTX. There were no differences in epidemiological variables (such as: age, BMI and comorbidities), nor variables associated with RA (tender joint count, swollen joint count, morning stiffness or extraarticular manifestations) between these groups. Patients who discontinued MTX had higher doses of this DMARD compared to patients who did not discontinue that DMARD (p = 0.006). Instead, patients who did not discontinue MTX had higher frequency of using folic acid supplements compared to those who discontinued MTX (p < 0.001). Patients who continued MTX had a longer time of using this DMARD compared to those who withdrew MTX (p < 0.001).",
        "In Figure 2B1–B4, we showed different risk factors associated with MTX discontinuation by Kaplan–Meier analyses: Figure 2B1 describes the relation of suspension due to AEs with higher MTX doses (≥15 mg/wk). Patients with higher doses of MTX had significantly higher rate of suspension for MTX due to AEs (p < 0.001).",
        "Figure 2B2 shows the comparison between survival on taking MTX in patients using folate supplementation vs. patients without it. Patients receiving folate supplementation had significantly lower rate of suspension for MTX due to AEs (p < 0.001). Figure 2B3 evaluates the effect of having gastropathy at baseline. Patients with gastropathy had significantly higher rate of suspension for MTX due to AEs (p = 0.016).",
        "Other risk factors were evaluated, such as the number of DMARDs at the beginning of the treatment, the presence of comorbidities, anemia and BMI >25 (Overweight to obesity, Figure 2B4); though none of these reported an effect over MTX survival.",
        "Table 5 shows the results of the multivariate Cox risk analysis. In the model, we included as time-dependent variable: MTX withdrawals due to adverse events. Covariables (potential confounders) tested in the unadjusted model (enter method) were female sex, overweight/obesity, presence of two or more comorbidities, tender joints count, swollen joints count, use of two or more DMARDs (MTX plus at least another DMARD), MTX dose equal to or higher than 15 mg/wk and folic acid supplementation. The risk model showed significant relations between MTX survival and the MTX dose ≥ 15 mg/wk (HR = 2.76, 95% CI: 1.33, 5.74, p = 0.006) and folic acid supplementation (HR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.49, p < 0.001), whereas no statistical associations were observed with the rest of covariables. In the second analysis, adjusting by stepwise method these potential confounders, in the model, only 2 variables remained significantly associated with risk of MTX withdrawals due to adverse events: MTX dose ≥ 15 mg/wk increasing the risk of MTX suspension (aHR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.22, 4.96, p = 0.012) and folic acid supplementation as protective factor (aHR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.49, p < 0.001).",
        "This study identified that the incidence rates of definitive suspension of MTX due to AEs were 9.5% at 1 year, 23.0% at 5 years, 35.6% at 10 years and 51.7% at 15 years from initiating the drug. The main risk factor that increased the probability of MTX suspension due to AEs was the use of higher doses of MTX (≥15 mg/wk), whereas the use of folic acid acted as a protective factor against suspension due to AEs. The most frequent cause of MTX definitive suspension in RA elderly patients was adverse events, mainly gastrointestinal and mucocutaneus effects.",
        "In the present study, we identified that 59.1% of elderly patients had MTX prescribed as a monotherapy at baseline and 29.7% in combined therapy. Monotherapy with MTX is more frequently indicated in elderly patients compared to young patients where the use of combined therapy with cs-DMARDS seems to be more frequently prescribed. In elderly RA patients, a concern is the increasing of side effects by pharmacological interactions of the high number of drugs used to treat comorbidities; therefore, it is more usual in our centers to prescribe MTX monotherapy in this population compared to younger RA patients. This therapeutic behavior has been reported by other studies: Tutuncu Z et al. compared in a cross-sectional design the information of two databases in different populations defined by age: the first was the information derived from the elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA) database and the second derived from information of the younger-onset rheumatoid arthritis (YORA) database; these authors described a higher proportion of using MTX monotherapy in elderly RA compared to younger RA patients where the utilization of combined therapy was more usual (p = 0.005) [20]. Mathieu S et al. followed for five years French RA patients, stratified in three different age groups: >50, 50 to 64, and 65 to 74 years old, observing a higher prevalence (68.4%) of MTX monotherapy in their elderly group (65 to 74 years old), observing higher rates of MTX suspension correlated with the increase of other cs-DMARDS co-utilization, although the oldest group showed a higher persistence to RA treatment regardless of the number of drugs received [21]. Similarly, in our study, we did not identify statistical differences in the rate of suspension of MTX by AEs when it was used in combined therapy compared against use of MTX monotherapy.",
        "We identified a low rate (9.5%) of MTX suspension due to AEs at 1 year of treatment; however, it increased to 23.0% at 5 years, and continued increasing to almost one of three patients (35.6%) at 10 years, and lastly, around one of each two patients (51.7%) suspended treatment at 15 years. Two studies performed in Danish and French RA patients identified a similar rate of MTX suspension at 5 years of treatment onset [15,21]. Bliddal H. et al. found a rate of MTX suspension in Danish RA patients (mean age 59.8 ± 14.4 years) similar to the one observed by us, of 25% at 5 years [15]. Mathieu S et al. observed in French RA patients, stratified in three groups as stated above, the rate of MTX suspension of 25% at 5 years, showing a higher retention rate in the oldest group [21]. Other authors have reported higher rates of MTX suspensions in their cohorts. Alarcon G.S. et al. reported a 55% rate of suspending MTX at 5 years due to toxicity in North American RA patients (mean age: 61.2 ± 12.4 years) [9]. Scully C.J. et al., in North American RA patients (mean age: 51 ± 12 years), observed that almost four of five patients (71.5%) suspended MTX at 5 years [22]. Lastly, Ideguchi H et al. reported that in Japanese RA patients (mean age 57.6 ± 11.4 years), there was a 40% rate of MTX suspension at 5 years [14]. Rate of MTX suspension due to AEs at 10 years was 35.6%, similar to those reported in Danish patients by Bliddal H, observing that at 10 years, 35% of patients stopped MTX treatment [15]. Other cohorts reported higher rates of suspension at 10 years. Hoesktra M et al. reported that in Dutch RA patients (median age: 59.7), at 9 years, the rate of MTX withdrawal was 50% [10]; Alarcon G.S. et al. observed a higher discontinuation rate of 70% in RA patients after 10 years (mean age: 61.2 ± 12.4) [8]. Lastly, to the best of our knowledge, we could not identify a cohort with a follow-up of 15 years of elderly patients, where one of each two patients (51.7%) had suspended treatment at the end of the study period.",
        "The main EAs reported in our study were gastrointestinal (15.7%), mucocutaneus (3.0%) and hepatic (2.5%). We identified several studies in which Aes were associated with the main cause of MTX suspension. Alarcon G.S. et al. described that the most frequent AEs leading to discontinuation of MTX in North American RA patients (mean age: 61.2 ± 12.4 years) were gastrointestinal events (43.8%) followed by AEs related to skin involvements (22.8%) [9]. Nikiphorou E et al. reported in a cohort of UK RA patients (mean age of the patients was not specified) that side effects were the main reason for MTX withdrawal, of which, gastrointestinal events were the most frequent adverse effects (32.7%) [23]. In a more recent study, Nagafuchi H et al. reported in a retrospective cohort performed in Egyptian RA patients (with median age: 58.0 years) that the most frequent causes of withdrawals were infections (20.0%), malignancies (14.1%) and respiratory disorders (10.2%) [24]. In comparison, the rate of infections and respiratory disorders as causes for suspension were significantly lower (5.4% and 3.7%, respectively), and no malignancies were reported in our cohort. Instead, the main cause of suspension was gastrointestinal effects like the causes reported in cohorts from North American patients [9]. Other cohort studies have reported the incidence of AEs in RA patients treated with DMARDs. Singal V. et al. analyzed the AEs in young patients from India (mean age: 38 years) observing abnormal level of transaminases (29.1%) and excessive nausea along with vomiting (16.6%); however, this cohort did not focus on treatment suspension [25]. Sherbini A. A. et al., in a prospective cohort, analyzed the rates and baseline predictor of AEs observed in the first year of MTX treatment in RA patients from the UK (mean age: 59 years); at twelve months, 77.5% of their patients reported at least one adverse event, mainly gastrointestinal (42.0%), constitutional (39.6%), neurological (28.6%), mucocutaneus (26.0%) and pulmonary (20.9%). Nevertheless, they did not extend the time of follow-up in this interesting cohort [26]. Takahashi C et al. reported in a 76 week study, 34% of 79 Japanese patients with RA (mean age: 56.7) had AEs, mainly gastrointestinal symptoms and hepatotoxicity [27]. Cummins L et al. described in a prospective cohort of 181 Australian RA patients (mean age: 52 years) who received a combination of triple DMARDs including MTX + SSZ + HCQ, the tolerability, persistence and efficacy. Of them, MTX was withdrawn in 29% of their patients, in this cohort, the gastrointestinal intolerance (15.0%) and rash (11.0%) being the most frequent AEs [28]. All these results reflect the importance of surveilling gastrointestinal and cutaneous AEs in users of MTX and support our study findings.",
        "We identified the risk factors associated with the suspension of MTX therapy due to adverse events. A MTX dose ≥ 15 mg/wk was found to increase 2.46-fold the risk of the suspension of MTX due to AEs. Two studies analyzed RA patients in which MTX withdrawal was associated with the use of lower doses of MTX compared to the doses observed in our patients. Ideguchi H et al., in Japanese RA patients (mean age: 57.6 ± 11.4 years), reported in their cohort study that MTX discontinuation is associated with lower MTX doses (>8 mg/wk), increasing the risk up to almost 3-fold [14]. Asai S et al., in a cross-sectional study in Japanese patients (Median age: 64), observed that MTX doses >8 mg/wk increased the risk of reflux and abdominal pain (OR: 1.62 and 1.62, respectively); however, association between these AEs and MTX suspension was not analyzed [29]. Shoda H. et al. performed a cohort in Japanese RA patients (mean age: 60.8), comparing the maintenance dose of MTX in patients who had AEs vs. RA patients without AEs, identifying a relation between higher doses and AEs (9.6 ± 4.2 mg/wk vs. 6.7 ± 3.0 mg/wk respectively, p = 0.03) [30]. These data support our results of a higher risk of withdrawals of this DMARD related to higher doses.",
        "In our study, folic acid supplementation was observed as a protective factor associated with MTX persistence, reducing the probability of MTX suspension due to AEs by 0.28-fold. Two other studies also identified the supplementation of folic acid as a protective factor in MTX therapy. Ideguchi H et al., in Japanese RA patients (mean age: 57.6 ± 11.4 years), reported that a lack of folic acid supplementation increases the risk of MTX discontinuation (RR = 1.93, p = 0.029), although it is not directly associated with AE development [14]. Hoekstra M et al., in their cohort of Dutch RA patients (median age: 59.7), reported that folate supplementation was associated with MTX survival, acting as a protective factor (RR = 0.25, p < 0.001) [10].",
        "The present study focused on MTX suspension due to AEs in elderly RA patients. There is limited information regarding suspension of MTX due to AEs in elderly RA patients. Our study shows that 19% to 35% of patients in our cohort of RA patients are aged ≥ 60 years old. Elderly RA patients represent a challenge for clinicians treating this subgroup of the population because they have an impairment in metabolism and excretion of several drugs, making them more susceptible to suffer adverse events linked to the drugs used for their treatments. The present study described the long-term incidence of suspension of MTX due to AEs. We identified that at 10 years, the rate of patients that suspended MTX was 35.6%, and at 15 years this increased up to 51.7%. The main AEs identified were gastrointestinal and mucocutaneous. Risk predictors were analyzed after using an adjusted multivariate analysis, the main risk factor being a higher dose of MTX and as a protective factor, the utilization of folic acid.",
        "However, this study has several limitations; the main one of them is derived from the retrospective cohorts where we cannot exclude the possibility that some information regarding several other risk factors could be missing. Among them, we have no information regarding genetic variables, MTX and its metabolites serum levels, therapeutic adherence or other variables that may influence the development of AEs but are not usually registered in the clinical charts. Another limitation observed in long-term retrospective cohorts is the loss of patients during the follow-up; in this cohort, the number of patients who were censored during the study was increased by other causes different to AEs. We therefore used the density of incidence as the strategy to identify the rate of therapeutic suspension of MTX, whereas prospective cohort studies with lower follow-up could use cumulative incidence as a better measure of incidence. We adjusted the time for developing events using Kaplan–Meir curves and hazard ratio in the multivariable Cox regression analysis. One potential limitation in our study was the use of 1987 ACR criteria for the inclusion of patients with a diagnosis of RA; although these criteria have a good sensitivity (79%) and specificity (90%) in patients with established RA, these values can decrease in patients with early RA (sensitivity of 77% and specificity 77%) [31]. However, at the time of the cohort onset, this set of criteria were the most used in the clinical settings in our country. Another additional limitation of this cohort was the lack of data regarding the positivity of anti-CCP antibodies; these antibodies have been related to several outcomes including erosions [32] and some extraarticular manifestations (such as subcutaneous nodules and lung involvement) [33]. In this cohort, an assessment of anti-CCP antibodies at the onset and their relation with adverse events of MTX was not investigated. Finally, we excluded elderly RA patients treated with biologic DMARDs; although, nowadays, the use of biologic therapy is more prescribed in our institution, at the time of the cohort onset, only 10% of the patients had this type of therapy.",
        "In elderly RA patients, the suspension of MTX usually occurs earlier in therapy, while as many as half of the patients tolerate it up to 15 years. The most frequent reason for suspending MTX is adverse events of a gastrointestinal and mucocutaneus nature. Higher doses of MTX were associated with an increased risk of suspension, while folate supplementation considerably improved MTX survival.",
