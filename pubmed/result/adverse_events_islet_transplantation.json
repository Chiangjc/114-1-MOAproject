        "Approximately 100 years since the discovery of insulin, type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains a life-altering and sometimes life-threatening diagnosis. While insulin is lifesaving, it fails to prevent progression of end-stage microvascular complications in many subjects, and imprecision with insulin delivery often results in hypoglycemia and glycemic lability. Modern insulin delivery systems include advances in insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring, and glucose-responsive systems, but these advances fail to prevent hypoglycemia, do not consistently enable subjects to achieve glycemic targets, are burdensome to wear for protracted periods, and can malfunction. Further, even with careful administration of exogenous insulin, long-term complications are common (Figures 1 and 2; Table 1).Figure 1The two different types of units used in the present study(Upper photo) Sentinels (VC-02-20), which are smaller in size (1.5 cm x 1 cm) and have fewer cells, are explanted and examined periodically to evaluate status of the dose-finding units.

        "Cell-based therapy may ultimately offer a more effective alternative to injected insulin. Over the past 20 years, islet transplantation has provided important proof-of-concept that restoring internally regulated insulin and glucagon production is a safe and effective treatment option for selected subjects with difficult-to-control T1D. Islet cell transplantation with concomitant immunosuppression can lead to clinically relevant endogenous insulin secretion.1,2,3 A few islet allograft recipients have maintained insulin-independence for over 20 years duration, but most return over time to needing minimal-to-moderate exogenous insulin administration. The most durable benefit of islet transplantation has been elimination of severe hypoglycemia while normalizing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in high-risk subjects.2,3",
        "However, cadaveric islet cell transplants are not approved for routine clinical use in the US. Extracting islets from donor pancreas organs is a complex, highly skilled, and unreliable process not available in most medical centers. Moreover, the small potential supply of human organ donors is so markedly imbalanced with the high incidence and prevalence of diabetes that a therapy relying solely on organ donors would not be sustainable even if islet transplant therapy were to become standardized, approved, and reimbursed.",
        "We set out to address the limitations of cadaveric islet transplantation by harnessing the potential of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to generate a renewable supply of cells for islet replacement.4 The distinct advantages of PSCs are that they can be differentiated into any cell type, including pancreatic islet endocrine cells, and can be propagated to the desired biomass prior to directed differentiation.5,6,7 Further, consistent and reproducible manufacturing can be performed as needed under clinically compliant current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) with robust quality control. Thus, human PSCs allow for a potentially unlimited, large-scale supply of replacement human islet-like cells.7,8,9",
        "Extensive preclinical work has been performed on PSC-derived pancreatic endoderm cells, such as the PEC-01 cell population, including multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells and immature endocrine cells; these have proven to be robust in culture and handling and to mature in a predictable and consistent fashion into functional islets, including glucose-responsive, insulin-secreting β cells and glucagon-secreting α cells, without off-target effects, following implantation in rodents.7,10,11,12,13 Pancreatic endoderm cells have also been shown to function effectively in rodents when delivered subcutaneously in macroencapsulation devices.13,14,15,16",
        "In the present study and accompanying paper,17 we show the success of an investigational biologic product capable of producing C-peptide when implanted successfully. C-peptide is produced by the pancreas as a byproduct of the formation of insulin but has a longer half-life in the body. These preliminary results are from an ongoing first-in-human, open-label phase 1/2 clinical trial where human PEC-01 pancreatic endoderm cells were implanted subcutaneously in subjects with T1D, utilizing an implantable delivery device that allows for direct vascularization of the cells. (Figures 1 and 2; Table 1) The device utilized here is conceptually and physically similar to that used in published preclinical studies as well as in another related clinical trial (NCT02239354, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02239354; the “Encaptra’ immunoprotective macroencapsulation device, which includes a cell-impermeable membrane). However, unlike Encaptra, the device used in the present trial has ports engineered in the membrane to allow the subject’s vasculature to grow into the lumen and directly vascularize the engrafted cells. The intention of direct vascularization is to enhance cell survival through improved oxygenation and metabolic exchange, recognizing that the device in this form would not offer immunoprotection. The product candidate comprising PEC-01 delivered in an open device is termed VC-02 combination product (also known as “PEC-Direct”). Due to the lack of physical immunoprotection, trial subjects were given pharmacological immunosuppression to prevent allo- and auto-immune rejection. Subjects who became C-peptide positive are referred to as “responders” and subjects who remained C-peptide negative are referred to as “non-responders.”",
        "The 17 clinical trial participants described here were negative for baseline C-peptide and received an identical immune suppression regimen. These 17 participants (9 male, 8 female) had ages ranging from 22 to 57 years and had had diabetes for 8 to 52 years. The subject population is further described in Table 2. Because the trial is still in progress, results from a subset of subjects are reported here. These results are from consecutive subjects in Cohort 2 of the ongoing trial and from their first 12 months of implant. Participation of some subjects was terminated early at around 12 months post-implant based upon a risk-benefit analysis, while others have reached longer time points, including 24 months post-implant; accordingly, more information is provided for these subjects.Table 2Patient demographics upon enrollmentParameter (allowed; units)Median (range)Age (18-65 years)47 (22–57)Gender (male/female)N/A (9 M/8 F)Weight (kg)79.5 (53.5–104)Years T1D (>5 years)37 (8–52)Insulin usage (units/day)36.5 (11.1–96.6)Glucose AUC (ng/mL)940 (314a–1388)HbA1c (< 10%)7.1 (5.9–9.0)Hypoglycemia unawareness (Clarke score >4)5 (4–7)Time in range % (70–180 mg/dL)60 (37–77)Time above range % (>180 mg/dL)34 (19-61)Time below range % (<70 mg/dL)5 (1–15)Hypoglycemic events (patient-reported <70 mg/dL; 7-day total)2 (0–17)aOne subject’s glucose values were available for analysis only through t = 90 min for the 4 h MMTT.",

        "Engraftment and insulin expression were observed in 63% of VC-02 units explanted from trial subjects at time periods from 3 to 12 months post-implant. Statistical analyses indicate that subjects who had units with substantial cell engraftment were more likely than those without this feature to have glucose- and/or mixed meal-responsive C-peptide measured in their blood at time periods from 6 to 24 months post-implant.",
        "For the 17 subjects, in the initial 12 months post-implant, there were 297 adverse events (AEs) recorded (224 were mild, 59 moderate, 10 severe, and 4 life-threatening). Causality assessments by investigators concluded that 83 AEs (27.9%) were possibly related to the surgical procedures (implant or explant) and 100 AEs (33.7%) were possibly related to immunosuppression, and 6 AEs (2%) were possibly related to the investigational product. Seven of 10 AEs that were reported as severe in intensity (2.4%) were determined by the investigators to be possibly related to VC-02 and included device protrusion (3 events), post-operative pain (2 events), swelling at incision sites (1), and post-procedural numbness (1). In addition, of the 10 serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring in 6 subjects, 5 were severe hypoglycemia, and the other 5 were uterine leiomyoma, parvovirus B19 infection, liver abscess, colitis, and pleural effusion. None of these SAEs were considered to be related to VC-02 as determined by investigators after further evaluation and are consistent with the preclinical safety data.",
        "To have the greatest opportunity to detect functional engraftment of implanted combination products, stimulated human C-peptide response to a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) prior to enrollment was used as a sensitive measure intended to reveal any residual endogenous β cell function. To be eligible for study inclusion, subjects had to demonstrate undetectable circulating C-peptide (below the limit of quantitation of < 0.1 ng/mL) prior to implant during the MMTT. As observed in preclinical studies, when implanting a progenitor cell population, MMTT and simplified meal challenges (sample collection at 0 min and at 60–90 min) performed in the initial few months following implantation continued to reveal no detectable circulating C-peptide at fasting or upon stimulation. Subsequently, a total of 6/17 subjects (35.3%) demonstrated stimulated C-peptide (>0.1 ng/mL) at varying time points as early as 6 months post implant. Table 3 provides sequential peak C-peptide measurements at multiple clinical visits, after glucose challenge through a MMTT. At 1–5 subsequent visits (to the visit where C-peptide was first detectable), a group of individual subjects showed positive C-peptide measurements during a MMTT. These C-peptide-positive subjects all presented with detectable engraftment as assessed by standard histology of hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides and expression of insulin as assessed by immunohistochemistry on explanted units, as shown in the two right-hand columns of Table 3. Graft-derived cell viability and insulin expression were lower among explants obtained from C-peptide negative subjects.Table 3Summary of stimulated C-peptide and histology analysis of graft explantsPre-implantPost-implantHistology (Number of insulin-positive graft cells per section)Maximum stimulated [C-peptide] (ng/mL)SubjectScreeninga6 mb9 mc12 mb15 mc18 mc21 mc24 mb3 m9-12 mA-006C-peptide negativeBQLBQL0.30.2n/aTBDTBD20225B-004BQLBQL0.1BQL0.2TBDTBD75820D-0010.1BQL0.1TBDTBDTBDTBD4611419E-0020.1OUTOUTOUTOUTOUTOUT56387E-006BQL0.10.2ND0.20.20.270132E-007BQL0.10.20.20.2TBDTBD3461123p value Responders (N = 6) versus Non-Responders (N = 11)0.03480.0514A-001C-peptide negativeBQLBQLBQLOUTOUTOUTOUT417A-002BQLBQLBQLOUTOUTOUTOUT1843A-003BQLBQLBQLOUTOUTOUTOUT241A-004BQLBQLBQLOUTOUTOUTOUT5NDA-005BQLBQLBQLOUTOUTOUTOUT3825B-003BQLBQLBQLOUTOUTOUTOUT1934C-001BQLBQLBQLOUTOUTOUTOUT751D-002BQLBQLBQLOUTOUTOUTOUT2230NDE-003BQLBQLBQLOUTOUTOUTOUT4657E-005BQLBQLBQLOUTOUTOUTOUT2271E-008BQLBQLBQLOUTOUTOUTOUT720Data from the 17 subjects in Cohort 2 are shown; the six subjects who exhibited de novo stimulated C-peptide measurements (peak measurement in ng/mL) are sorted to the top of the table.Letters A-E in the subject number represent different clinical sites.The same C-peptide ELISA analysis was performed for all samples.

        "In 71% of the explant procedures (24/34 overall) performed at either 3 months or at 9-12 months, more than one sentinel unit was removed from the subject. When multiple units were removed, the histology scoring was determined by the average number of cells staining positive for insulin across multiple explanted units. There was a distinct subset of subjects showing circulating C-peptide, classified as responders (n = 6), who demonstrated glucose-responsive C-peptide (increase in C-peptide after increase in blood glucose) after an MMTT.17 Explants from these subjects contained greater numbers of graft-derived, insulin-staining cells. Conversely, explants from non-responders (n = 11), who did not show detectable C-peptide measurements, were observed to have fewer graft-derived β cells. Statistical analysis indicates significantly more graft cells staining positive for insulin at 3 months when comparing responders to non-responders (Table 3). Insulin content and secretion per β cell increased with implantation duration, suggesting that the accumulation of β cells and/or their maturation may contribute to the delayed appearance of detectable C-peptide.",
        "As represented in Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figures S1 and S2, at least one sentinel explanted between 3 and 12 months from 15/17 subjects in the trial showed detectable engraftment, with expression of insulin in at least 30 graft-derived cells per histological section shown via immunohistochemical staining. Importantly, explanted dose-finding units showed proportionally similar histological results to sentinels at the respective time points and within a subject.Figure 3Histology of cross-sections of a sentinel explanted from “Subject D-001” with glucose-responsive C-peptide illustrates both the cellular and non-cellular regions of a mature graft(A–C) Three serial cross-sections (B) of approximately 4 mm apart within the explant stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) reveal cellular regions (purple, hematoxylin-stained, enlarged in C) and non-cellular regions (pink, eosin-stained, enlarged in A).

        "By 12 weeks post-implant, graft-derived cells were organized structurally into clusters primarily with endocrine cell morphology and expressing, in order of abundance, glucagon, insulin, or somatostatin (Figure S1). In total, chromogranin A-staining endocrine cells accounted for 66% of graft-derived cells. Host lymphocytes, exclusively T cells identified through CD3 expression with B cells excluded through the absence of CD22 staining, were sporadically observed around the external periphery of the units, with T cells rarely detectable among graft cells within the unit lumen. Host cells were fully integrated into the devices, with a thin fibrous tissue capsule established around the implant.",
        "Blood vessels were observed in the tissue capsule and within the device lumen, indicating they traversed through ports in the membrane. Blood vessels were identified through staining with CD34 (Pusztaszeri et al., 2006),18 marking the luminal side vascular endothelial cells of larger vessels as well as capillaries, and with alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) staining larger vessels but only weakly detectible in capillaries (Figure 3 and Figure S2). Non-vascular host cells were also observed inside the unit lumen. By histological phenotype, many of the infiltrating cells of host origin were characterized as myofibroblasts associated with the wound healing response and also staining positive for αSMA (Figure 3 and Figure S2). While graft-derived cells were detected in the majority of explants, host-derived fibroblasts predominated within the lumen of nearly all explants, with graft-derived cells constituting on average just 40% of total cells among explants from responders and 26% in explants from non-responders. Within regions of the device lumen where host-derived fibroblasts were dominant, graft-derived cells were rare or absent (Figure S2). Host cells could be distinguished from graft cells in female subjects by their absence of Y chromosome-specific FISH, which positively marks the implanted cells of CyT49 male origin. Additional histological analyses are described in the accompanying manuscript by Ramzy et al.17",
        "At one year, by design of the protocol, subjects without measurable C-peptide during the MMTT were withdrawn from the study, and all units explanted and immunosuppression discontinued after explantation. If the units had not engrafted, matured, and yielded C-peptide by this point, it was believed it would be highly unlikely they would acquire robust function subsequently. When balancing the declining possibility of graft function against the risks and demands of trial participation for the second year of the 17 subjects described herein (including immunosuppression), 11 were terminated soon before or at one year post-implant; these are the subjects noted “below the line’ in Table 3.",
        "Characterization of units explanted at 9 months to 1 year after implant are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Blood vessels were observed traversing the capsule, against the external aspect of the unit membranes, and within the lumen. A robust matrix of blood vessels was elaborated in the regions of the device containing graft cells of endocrine profile, but not in regions where graft-derived cells were rare. Based on CD34-staining quantitation, areas of the device lumen containing graft-derived cells had 10-fold higher blood vessel density compared to non-cellular areas of the device (Figure 3). Two major regions could be characterized inside the lumen: cellular and largely non-cellular. Units showed different proportions of these two regions. Figure 3 illustrates the two regions in “Subject D-001,” who showed glucose-responsive C-peptide at several time points. For “Subject E-002,” a dose-finding unit examined at approximately 1 year (11 months) appeared similar to findings with sentinels at the same time (Figure 4).",
        "When considering responders and non-responders, no statistically significant differences were observed comparing pre- and post-implant measures, including changes in glycemic parameters (time-below-range, time-in-range, time-above-range, HbA1C, insulin dosing; data shown in Table S1).",
        "Glucose-responsive insulin secretion as captured by de novo C-peptide production was observed in T1D subjects implanted with PSC-derived cells. Similar findings were subsequently noted, as described in the accompanying paper.17 This phenomenon has previously been described in animal models using PSC-derived pancreatic progenitors8,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 and in the somewhat analogous clinical context of cadaveric islet transplants with immunosuppression.1 However, this report is a clinical observation of the nexus, whereby a scalable source of cells (PSC-derived pancreatic progenitors) is used to generate implantable material that engrafts and matures into glucose-responsive insulin-secreting tissue. The progressive accumulation of functional, insulin-secreting cells occurs over a period of approximately 6–9 months from the time of implant. However, once a subject shows positive C-peptide, this appears to be durable, and correlates clearly with survival and differentiation of human insulin-producing cells over time. Although one subject at one time point appears to have dipped below the limit of quantitation, every subject who showed circulating C-peptide at some point also showed it upon a subsequent MMTT, and all still had detectable C-peptide upon their most recent MMTT. To further support these data, we now have evidence of higher levels of glucose-responsive C-peptide with clinically relevant glycemic improvements (including time-in-range, HbA1C, and insulin dosing) as seen in a subsequent subject in VC-02 from a later group of patients with a device with a different configuration.19",
        "The previous related clinical study testing PSC-derived pancreatic endoderm cells (PEC-01 cells) for T1D in a fully encapsulating device (VC-01 trial NCT02239354 [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02239354]) showed that (1) such a product candidate can acquire neovasculature and (2) PEC-01 cells mature to insulin-expressing β cells in human subjects with T1D.20 Neither of these observations was a foregone conclusion. T1D is associated with impaired wound healing, which might also manifest as an inability to generate neovasculature, particularly in the subcutaneous location. Although PEC-01 and other pancreatic progenitor cell populations are now well known to mature into functional human islet tissue in animals, including T1D models, it was possible the same might not hold true for implants in human T1D subjects. Both of these critical elements of the general approach—vascularization and maturation into functional endocrine islet tissue in subjects with T1D—were again demonstrated using the VC-02 paradigm.",
        "Beyond the surgical implantation and explant procedural risks and side-effects of immunosuppression, which together accounted for the great majority of the mild-to-moderate adverse effects, the VC-02 product candidate in general appears to be safe and well-tolerated. Importantly, there were no safety concerns reported as a result of the biologic activity of VC-02 with respect to off-target growth; specifically, there were no teratomas seen within the units, nor was there evidence of metastatic growth observed outside of the containment devices. Moreover, we observed no HLA sensitization (based upon lack of clinically relevant, de novo reactivity to donor-specific antigens post-implant), no more frequent or severe hypoglycemia secondary to unregulated insulin or other hormonal secretion, and no other untoward effects. While immunosuppression is an additional challenge for a T1D subject to endure, for those experiencing hypoglycemia unawareness or glycemic lability, the risk-benefit balance could well tip in favor of using such a product, if this enables better glycemic control and fewer life-threatening severe hypoglycemic events. Despite potent systemic immune suppression, multiple surgical implantation sites, and the presence of foreign materials, the risk of local infection was exceedingly low, suggesting that this approach is well tolerated in subjects with T1D who are at risk for a poor healing response.",
        "In summary, the present study demonstrates, in a small number of human subjects with T1D, that PSC-derived pancreatic progenitor cells have the capacity to survive, engraft, differentiate, and mature into human islet-like cells when implanted subcutaneously. These cells demonstrate strong insulin staining and produce measurable glucose- and meal-responsive C-peptide production in peripheral blood. Induction and maintenance immunosuppression appear to be effective in preventing allogeneic and autoimmune destruction of the graft cells, at least in this subset of subjects. However, immune sensitization from non-compliance with immunotherapy could potentially lead to a decreased stem cell survival, leading to graft failure. Investigations are underway to access how to best promote graft vascularization and survival, reduce the infiltration of host-derived fibroblasts, and eliminate the need for immunosuppressive therapy.",
        "Despite the measurable C-peptide observed in the responder subjects, no statistically significant measurable clinical benefit has yet been observed in this pilot study. This lack of therapeutic response is most likely attributable to insufficient numbers of engrafted PSC-derived pancreatic progenitor cells, i.e., insufficient β cell mass and the need for further optimization of the device and/or administration method. One of the goals of the trial is to understand how to effectively deliver the cells in a way that achieves maximal engraftment such that the dosing requirements can be determined for future and ongoing iterative trials. While approximately 30% of the subjects exhibited some regions of the device lumen with notable graft cells at 3 and 12 months post-implant, every graft explanted also contained substantial regions of non-cellular material, consistent with noted graft-to-graft variability. These regions are most likely collagen and other extracellular material produced by the infiltrating host myofibroblasts observed at earlier time points. The infiltration of myofibroblasts and their secretion of extracellular matrix may be an impediment for cellular engraftment, given that (1) large regions of extracellular matrix are not observed in fully encapsulated VC-01 explants (into which no host cells can enter), and (2) the non-cellular regions are observed closest to the ports where there is the greatest access of host cells to the lumen.",
        "It is most likely that the appearance of glucose-responsive C-peptide in some of the subjects was related to the implanted cells and not to other manipulations, in particular the addition of an immunosuppressive regimen per se. While there is some suggestion that immunosuppression might dampen autoimmunity in T1D, and therefore create an opportunity for the endogenous β cell population to recover, attempts to demonstrate this principle clinically have not been successful. In the accompanying paper,17 subjects implanted with PEC-01 cells showed demonstrable C-peptide levels prior to explant with levels disappearing post-explant. This provides strong evidence that the observed C-peptide levels are derived from the graft cells and are not due to the stimulatory effect of the immunosuppression regimen.",
        "Clinical islet recipients also represent an important control for this possibility, as we have not observed incremental increases in C-peptide production over time in failing grafts while identical maintenance immune suppression is continued in subjects with T1D (unpublished data). Moreover, the correlation observed in the current study between C-peptide detection and histological evidence of islet-like differentiation is further compelling evidence that the implanted cells are effectively stimulated by circulating glucose levels and release insulin in response (see Table 3).17",
        "We do not have data on the number or percentage of ductal and acinar cells in the histological sections shown in the supplementary figures. However, the accompanying paper from Ramzy et al. 17 describes data that show the majority of graft cells to be endocrine, with a minority of ductal and very rare exocrine cells. Additional cellular analysis, including more detailed analysis of pancreatic cells and non-endocrine cells such as vascular cells and fibroblasts, would have been helpful, and will be addressed in future.",

        "The first-in-human Phase 1/2, ongoing open-label study called “A Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy Study of VC-02™ Combination Product in Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypoglycemia Unawareness” has been conducted at 7 centers in North America and recently expanded to include 1 center in Belgium (clinicaltrials.gov\nNCT03163511). Long-standing T1D subjects were selected based on confirmation of hypoglycemia unawareness and/or glycemic lability as part of stringent selection criteria (Table 1). All subjects signed the informed consent, and all study sites were approved by an Institutional Review Board. Subjects were both genders (9 male, 8 female), ages ranged from 22-57 years and had had diabetes for 8-52 years. A Clarke score 34 confirmed subjects qualifying for study participation on the basis of hypoglycemia unawareness (Clarke et al., 1995).1 The primary efficacy endpoint was the measurement of C-peptide in response to a Mixed-Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT) and simplified meal challenges (sample collection at 0 min and at 60 to 90 min) as a measure intended to indicate implanted progenitor cell function. Primary outcome measures were incidence of all AEs reported for subjects in the first cohort, and change in C-peptide from baseline for subjects in the second cohort.",
        "Inclusion criteria specified men and non-pregnant women, diagnosis of T1D for a minimum of five years, hypoglycemia unawareness (Clarke score) or significant glycemic lability, stable diabetic treatment, willingness to use a continuous glucose meter, and being an acceptable candidate for surgical implantation. Exclusion criteria included history of islet cell, kidney, and/or pancreas transplant; 6 or more severe, unexplained hypoglycemic events within 6 months of enrollment; uncontrolled or untreated thyroid disease or adrenal insufficiency; diabetic complications such as severe kidney disease or renal dysfunction, proliferative retinopathy, foot ulcers, amputations, and/or severe peripheral neuropathy; or detectable stimulated serum C-peptide during the screening period (C-peptide was assessed at two separate screening visits) (Table 1).",
        "Subjects were enrolled into Cohort 1 to establish the initial safety profile of the product candidate. A total of 30 additional subjects were then implanted to initiate evaluation of product efficacy in Cohort 2 by the time of the manuscript data cut. Of these subjects, 19 had reached a minimum of 9-12 months of study participation (or had withdrawn from the study). Preliminary results from 17 of 19 subjects in Cohort 2 of the trial, who were confirmed as C-peptide-negative prior to implant, and received the same immunodepletion regimen, are reported here. Of the 2 subjects not included in these results, 1 had measurable C-peptide prior to implant; the other received basiliximab as opposed to ATG for immunodepletion. These two subjects are excluded from these analyses to describe results from a more uniform cohort (Table 1).",
        "PEC-01 cells were manufactured from CyT49 PSCs as described and cryopreserved to facilitate lot release prior to combination product manufacture.8 PEC-01 is a cell population largely comprised of pancreatic progenitor and immature endocrine cells manufactured via directed differentiation of hESC. The CyT49 hESC line was derived by ViaCyte from an ethically-consented embryo in a process compliant with governing regulations and is the starting material for cell product manufacture. It is the only cell line being handled in the GMP manufacturing facility, and the cell line identity is assured via the quality process, batch records, and labeling. Tiered Master and Working Cell Banks have been qualified. PEC-01 is manufactured during a 28-day process involving expansion of hESC-, aggregation into suspension culture, directed differentiation to highly enriched pancreatic endoderm cells followed by harvesting and cryopreservation. Quality control testing and release of a PEC-01 lot are performed in the 2 to 3 weeks after each lot is cryopreserved.",
        "The delivery devices were comprised of a multi-layer ‘sandwich’ including (1) a semi-permeable membrane made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene with engineered portals, and (2) an external polyester mesh to provide rigidity.1 PEC-01 cells were thawed and cultured for 3 days to re-establish robust viability, formulated in enriched media, and loaded into devices with media via access tubing, which was subsequently sealed and trimmed before final aseptic packaging of the VC-02 units for shipment and implant.",
        "Implanted units were either ‘sentinel’ units or ‘dose-finding’ units (Figure 1). Both were implanted in one surgery session. Units were explanted at various time points post-implant as described here.",
        "The dose-finding units (300 μL capacity = VC-02-300) are larger units, approximately 3cm x 9cm ‘footprint’ surface area x 1mm thick and are intended to represent quanta of cell dosing. Results from these units help determine how many will eventually be needed for a potentially therapeutic dose. Although there are multiple considerations with cell therapy dosing, especially in this context (progenitors terminally differentiate into endocrine cells post-implant with potential to proliferate, and proliferation may be constrained by the physical device limits), each dose-finding unit is loaded with approximately 75 million PEC-01 cells. Based upon preclinical studies completed at ViaCyte, each unit has the potential to deliver approximately 250,000 islet equivalents upon maturity.",
        "Sentinel units (20 μL capacity = VC-02-20) allow serial ‘sampling’ via explant for characterization at various time points post-implant. Sentinels are small delivery devices with a negligible dose of cells intended to not significantly affect outcomes upon periodic removal, but sufficient to reflect the histological characteristics of the larger units. The ‘footprint’ surface area (X-Y dimensions) of the two unit sizes are different, but the microenvironment (Z-dimension) defining the distance of cells within the device from the subject’s tissue, is analogous. Sentinels are approximately 1.5cm x 1cm in area x 1mm thick, and each is loaded with approximately 6 million PEC-01 cells. As described in ‘Results,’ we found that observations from sentinels did indeed reflect the characteristics of the dose-finding units.",
        "Each subject was implanted with up to 4 dose-finding units in the deep subcutaneous tissues of the anterior and lateral abdominal wall, and up to 6 of the sentinel units placed in the volar forearm or abdominal wall. Sentinels were explanted sequentially for histology at various time points with any and all remaining sentinel units explanted at study completion (up to 24 months). As this is an open-label clinical trial with iterative incorporation of learnings, actual numbers and locations of units varied from subject to subject, depending upon information available at time of implant.",
        "VC-02 units include engineered membrane portals to allow host cells to pass freely into the unit and for the subject’s vasculature to grow into the graft. The portals traverse the entire thickness of the membrane and are large enough bore to allow meaningfully-sized diameter vasculature to ingress, develop, and mature (Figure 1).",
        "This cohort evaluates the ability to achieve engraftment and demonstrate efficacy while further evaluating the safety of the product (the objective of Cohort 1). Subjects in Cohort 2 have remained implanted for up to 2 years. While sentinels are explanted at various time points, the larger dose-finding units are intended to remain implanted for the full duration of subject participation. Subjects in Cohort 2 received up to 10 units total in 1 surgical implantation session, of which up to 4 were VC-02-300 units and the remainder, sentinels (Figure 2).",
        "A 4 h MMTT was conducted during the screening period to establish the pre-implant basal and stimulated C-peptide and glucose levels of each subject, and at specific study visits post-implant in accordance with the primary endpoint. At multiple interim study visits post-implant, C-peptide levels were instead assessed using 2 h MMTTs to limit subject burden. The MMTT could only be started if the subject had been fasting for a minimum of 8 h. Prior to initiating the MMTT, the subject’s fasting glucose was required to be within 70-200 mg/dL to begin. If it was not within range after repeat testing, the subject was requested to return to the site within visit window to repeat the MMTT. During the MMTT, subjects were allowed to continue exogenous basal insulin; however, short-acting insulin was held for 4 h before starting the test. A 4 h MMTT was also performed at month 12.",
        "Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data were acquired through use of study-provisioned Dexcom G4 or G5 m. CGM data analysis was based on the most recent 14-day period prior to each study visit.",
        "Serum samples taken during MMTTs were sent to a central lab for measurement of C-peptide concentration (ADVIA Centaur® assay from Siemens). The lower limit of quantitation for this assay is 0.1 ng/mL (reference range 0.8-4.4 ng/mL).",
        "To protect implanted cells from allo- and auto-immunity, immunosuppression was used similar to current practice in islet transplantation.1 2 All 17 subjects received depletional induction immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG: up to 6 mg/kg i.v. over 5 days), tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockade with etanercept (50 mg i.v. pre-implant followed by 25 mg subcutaneous x 3 doses out to 10 days post-implant) followed by maintenance tacrolimus (target 10-12 ng/mL for the first 3 months; 7-9 ng/mL thereafter) and mycophenolate mofetil (up to 2 g per day as tolerated). Tacrolimus levels during the 12 months in responders and non-responders are illustrated in Table S1 (shown as TAC level in the final line of each table).",
        "Formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded sections of explants were stained on a Leica BOND-III immunohistochemistry instrument according to the manufacturer’s suggestions, using the following antibodies to detect alpha smooth muscle actin (ACTA2, Abcam ab125044); CD22 (Leica PA0249); CD3 (Leica PA0553); CD34 (Leica PA0212); CDX2 (Abcam ab76541); chromogranin A (Abcam ab68271); FOXA2 (Abcam ab108422); glucagon (Sigma G2654); insulin (Cell Signaling Technology 3014S); NKX6-1 (LSBio LS-C124275). Quantitation of insulin-staining cells and CD34-staining density determinations were made with Tissue Studio image analysis software from Definiens.",
        "For the histology analysis and the secondary efficacy measures, including changes in glycemic parameters (time-below-range, time-in-range, time-above-range, HbA1C, insulin dosing), the median was used as the measure of central tendency, as the data were not normally distributed, and the non-parametric Wilcoxon Two-Sample test, also known as the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, was used, with the Kruskal-Wallis p value used for determining statistical significance. Results of the statistical analysis of histology are shown in Table 3.",
        "The data for these 17 subjects were analyzed using SAS 9.4. There were 6 responders and 11 non-responders included in the data analysis. Data from Month 3 and Months 9 or 12 were included in the analysis. If there were multiple observations for a subject at a time point, then the average of those observations was included in the analysis. Normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and visually inspected using Q-Q plots. Both the test and the plots indicated the data violated normality assumptions (i.e., the data were not normally distributed) for the variables that were analyzed. Hence, the comparison of the responders and non-responders was performed using the Wilcoxon Two-Sample test, also known as the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. A significance level of α = 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.",

    "title": "Efficacy and safety of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in Chinese adults with type 2 diabetes: a single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial. mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) in Chinese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: In this single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial, 91 patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs (n = 45) or placebo (n = 46) three times with 4-week intervals and followed up for 48 weeks from October 2015 to December 2018. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of < 7.0% and daily insulin reduction of >/= 50% at 48 weeks. Additional endpoints were changes of metabolic control, islet beta-cell function, insulin resistance, and safety. RESULTS: At 48 weeks, 20% of the patients in the UC-MSCs group and 4.55% in the placebo group reached the primary endpoint (p < 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.25-28.66%). The percentage of insulin reduction of the UC-MSCs group was significantly higher than that of the placebo group (27.78% versus 15.62%, p < 0.05). The levels of HbA1c decreased 1.31% (9.02 +/- 1.27% to 7.52 +/- 1.07%, p < 0.01) in the UC-MSCs group, and only 0.63% in the placebo group (8.89 +/- 1.11% to 8.19 +/- 1.02%, p>0.05; p = 0.0081 between both groups). The glucose infusion rate (GIR) increased significantly in the UC-MSCs group (from 3.12 to 4.76 mg/min/kg, p < 0.01), whereas no significant change was observed in the placebo group (from 3.26 to 3.60 mg/min/kg, p > 0.05; p < 0.01 between both groups). There was no improvement in islet beta-cell function in both groups. No major UC-MSCs transplantation-related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: UC-MSCs transplantation could be a potential therapeutic approach for Chinese adults with T2DM.

Methods In this single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial, 91 patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs ( n = 45) or placebo ( n = 46) three times with 4-week intervals and followed up for 48 weeks from October 2015 to December 2018. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of < 7.0% and daily insulin reduction of ≥ 50% at 48 weeks. Additional endpoints were changes of metabolic control, islet β-cell function, insulin resistance, and safety. Results At 48 weeks, 20% of the patients in the UC-MSCs group and 4.55% in the placebo group reached the primary endpoint ( p < 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.25–28.66%). The percentage of insulin reduction of the UC-MSCs group was significantly higher than that of the placebo group (27.78% versus 15.62%, p < 0.05). The levels of HbA1c decreased 1.31% (9.02 ± 1.27% to 7.52 ± 1.07%, p < 0.01) in the UC-MSCs group, and only 0.63% in the placebo group (8.89 ± 1.11% to 8.19 ± 1.02%, p ˃0.05; p = 0.0081 between both groups). The glucose infusion rate (GIR) increased significantly in the UC-MSCs group (from 3.12 to 4.76 mg/min/kg, p < 0.01), whereas no significant change was observed in the placebo group (from 3.26 to 3.60 mg/min/kg, p ˃ 0.05; p < 0.01 between both groups). There was no improvement in islet β-cell function in both groups. No major UC-MSCs transplantation-related adverse events occurred. Conclusions UC-MSCs transplantation could be a potential therapeutic approach for Chinese adults with T2DM.

        "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a heterogeneous syndrome that is characterized by a progressive deterioration in glycemic control caused by decreased insulin sensitivity and diminished insulin secretion, which has become a serious threat to human health worldwide due to its high prevalence and severe morbidity. Diet control, physical exercise, and glucose-lowering medications have been shown to temporarily improve hyperglycemia but cannot inhibit the pathogenesis or reduce the morbidity of T2DM. Therefore, the development of more effective approaches for the treatment of T2DM is required.",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a type of adult stem cells with profound anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory capacities by secreting a variety of cytokines and immunosuppressive molecules [1, 2]. They have been successfully applied in the treatment of different types of autoimmune diseases, such as stroke [3], myocardial infarction [4], rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus [5, 6], and graft versus host disease [7]. Chronic inflammatory responses and immune disorders in insulin-sensitive tissues and pancreatic islets contribute to insulin resistance, islet β-cell destruction, and the onset of T2DM. Therefore, MSCs transplantation might be a therapeutic option for T2DM. Previous animal studies have demonstrated that MSCs treatment ameliorated hyperglycemia by promoting pancreatic islet recovery and alleviating insulin resistance [8, 9]. Moreover, an increasing number of clinical trials have reported the therapeutic effects and safety of MSCs transplantation in patients with T2DM [10–20]. MSCs can be derived from various tissues (e.g., bone marrow, adipose tissues, and umbilical cord), and the procurement or use of MSCs is deemed non-controversial. MSCs were first isolated from bone marrow [21], which was considered the most accessible source of MSCs for the treatment of T2DM [22]. Several clinical trials have confirmed the therapeutic potential of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) in T2DM [10, 12, 14–17]. Umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) share similar immunosuppressive properties as BM-MSCs and possess clinical potential for T2DM owing to their low-cost, pain-free, high-yield, rapid-collection, and non-immunogenicity characteristics [19]. However, few clinical studies have focused on the treatment of T2DM with UC-MSCs and no clinical trials have reported the effect of UC-MSCs on insulin resistance in patients with T2DM. Therefore, a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II trial was performed to explore the efficacy and safety of intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs in patients with T2DM.",
        "This prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II trial was performed at the First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (PLAGH; Beijing, China) from October 2015 to December 2018. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the First Medical Center of PLAGH (Approval No. 2013-107-01) and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. All participants provided written informed consent before recruitment. This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02302599).",
        "Patients who met the following inclusion criteria were qualified for enrollment: (1) aged between 20 and 65 years; (2) diagnosed with T2DM for < 20 years (HbA1c levels between 7.0% and 12.0%, inclusive; (3) inadequately controlled by stable insulin therapy (0.5–1.0 U/kg/day) with metformin for ≥ 3 months; (4) with fasting C-peptide levels of ≥ 1 ng/mL; and (5) with a body mass index (BMI) of 24–40 kg/m2. Patients were excluded from this study if they had ketonuria, tumors, serum creatinine levels < 175 μmol/L, previously diagnosed with myocardial infarction, current angina or heart failure, ˃ 1 major vascular event, retinopathy that required laser treatment, malignant hypertension, an uncorrected endocrine disorder, occupations that precluded insulin therapy, severe concurrent illness that limited life expectancy, inadequate understanding of the study protocol, drug abuse, planning pregnancy, and an allergic constitution. The full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the appendix.",
        "The Interactive Web Response System was used to assign eligible patients into the trial in a 1:1 ratio according to age of the patients (< 40 or ≥ 40 years), BMI (< 28, ≥ 28, or ≥ 32 kg/m2), duration of T2DM (< 5, ≥ 5, or ≥ 10 years), and HbA1c levels (< 7.5%, ≥ 7.5% or ˃9%). All patients were assessed at baseline and pre-established follow-up time points (at 9, 20, 32, and 48 weeks). All investigators and participants were masked to treatment allocation.",
        "Human umbilical cords were obtained from healthy women who gave birth in the First Medical Center of Chinese PLAGH. All subjects provided informed consent. All procedures were performed according to the Guidelines of the Ethics Committee of the First Medical Center of Chinese PLAGH. UC-MSCs were isolated from the gelatinous tissues surrounding the vein and artery and were characterized by phenotype analysis and cell differentiation assay as previously described [23, 24]. Patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs (100 mL) or the same volume and appearance of placebo (UC-MSCs suspension liquid composed of saline with 3% human albumin and 0.5 mL multivitamins) at the elbow joint three times with an interval of 4 weeks and then discharged after 24 h of observation without any adverse events. UC-MSCs at four passages were used in this study, and the total number of UC-MSCs for each transfusion was 1 × 106/kg.",
        "After discharge, patients were followed every 12 weeks for 48 weeks and required to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose (≥ 15 times per week that included a 5-point profile) on different days during follow-up. Insulin titration was based on peripheral blood glucose levels, with target fasting plasma glucose levels between 4.4 and 7.0 mmol/L. Patients were recommended to maintain a regular diabetic diet and healthy lifestyle during hospitalization and follow-up. If the total daily insulin dose of a patient was ≤ 0.2 U/kg at any time during the study, they discontinued the use of exogenous insulin and were given an oral anti-diabetic agent to prevent hypoglycemia. If a patient developed uncontrolled blood glucose with a total daily insulin dose of ˃1.5 U/kg, they discontinued the study, and the hypoglycemic strategy was adjusted according to the condition of the patient to prevent diabetic complications. Insulin requirement and HbA1c levels were assessed every 12 weeks. Islet β-cell function was indicated by the levels of fasting C-peptide, fold change in C-peptide levels stimulated by intravenous administration of 1 mg glucagon, and the C-peptide area under the curve (AUCC-pep) in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT, 6 points) at baseline and 9, 20, and 48 weeks. The AUCC-pep was calculated using the trapezoidal method. The glucose infusion rate (GIR) measured by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC) was used to indicate insulin resistance at baseline, 9 and 48 weeks. The potential risk of UC-MSCs transplantation was observed during treatment and follow-up.",
        "The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with HbA1c levels of < 7.0% and daily insulin reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline to 48 weeks. The secondary endpoints were changes in insulin requirement, HbA1c levels, and percentage of patients with HbA1c levels of < 7.0% from baseline to 9, 20, 32, and 48 weeks; changes in islet β-cell function (indicated by fasting C-peptide levels, glucagon-stimulated C-peptide changes, and AUCC-pep) from baseline to 9, 20, and 48 weeks; and changes of insulin resistance (indicated by GIR) from baseline to 9 and 48 weeks.",
        "The primary safety endpoints included immediate adverse events following intravenous administration of UC-MSCs or placebo, adverse events related to hypersensitivity, injection site reactions, infection, tumor formation, abnormal vital signs in electrocardiogram, ultrasound scan, and laboratory tests, and occurrence of hypoglycemia in the safety population (defined as all participants who received ≥ 1 dose of UC-MSCs or placebo). More details and the review process are provided in the appendix.",
        "Data were analyzed using the SAS software (version 9.4). Normally distributed continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), while non-normally distributed variables were expressed as median (IQR). An independent two-sample t-test was used to determine the differences of quantitative variables (e.g., fasting plasma glucose levels, HbA1c levels, fasting C-peptide levels, insulin dose, and GIR) between both groups. Non-normally distributed variables were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical variables were expressed as frequency and percentile. A Chi-squared (χ2) test or Fisher’s exact test was used to determine statistical significances between the two groups. The paired t-test or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used for within-group comparisons. The χ2 test was performed to analyze the differences in the percentage of patients with HbA1c levels of < 7.0% and daily insulin reduction of ≥ 50% between both groups. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the rate difference was also determined. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
        "Cultured human UC-MSCs had a bipolar spindle-shaped and fibroblast-like morphology (Additional file 1: Fig. S1A). Then, the immunophenotypic features and multi-lineage differentiation potential of adherent cells were examined. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. 1B, cells expressed surface markers of UC-MSCs, including CD90, CD73, and CD105, and negative surface markers of UC-MSCs, including CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR, were not detected. Moreover, UC-MSCs exhibited differentiation potential to osteoblasts (Additional file 1: Fig. S1C) and adipocytes (Additional file 1: Fig. S1D).",
        "Between October 2015 and December 2018, 183 patients were screened for eligibility and 91 were finally recruited. Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to receive UC-MSCs transplantation (n = 45) or placebo (n = 46). A total of 73 (86.8%) patients completed the trial, with 37 (82.2%) patients in the UC-MSCs group and 36 (78.3%) patients in the placebo group. Two patients in the placebo group did not complete all treatments. Two patients were withdrawn due to adverse events, and six patients were lost to follow-up in both groups (Fig. 1).

One patient was diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma and one patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer on the final visit; therefore, they discontinued the study. No treatment-associated deaths were reported during the study. Other patients showed no positive tumor markers, and no tumor was detected by imaging examinations. Physical examinations and laboratory tests revealed no other UC-MSCs-related side effects within 48 weeks of follow-up. All patients (n = 91) remain under follow-up for potential late-onset side effects.",
        "This prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II trial showed that intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs at the elbow joint resulted in a higher percentage of patients achieving the target HbA1c levels < 7.0% and daily insulin reduction of ≥ 50% at 48 weeks compared with the placebo group. UC-MSCs treatment reduced daily insulin requirement, decreased HbA1c levels, and ameliorated insulin resistance in a time-dependent manner. No major UC-MSCs transplantation-related adverse events occurred. These results indicated the potential efficacy and safety of UC-MSCs transplantation for the treatment of T2DM.",
        "In 2009, Bhansali et al. first showed that BM-MSCs transplantation significantly reduced insulin requirement and improved stimulated C-peptide levels in 10 patients with T2DM [10]. Then, a number of studies have confirmed the efficacy and safety of BM-MSCs and placenta-derived MSCs in the treatment of T2DM [11–17], including three prospective, randomized, single-blinded placebo-controlled studies [14, 15, 17]. UC-MSCs are immune-privileged, immune-suppressive cells that are readily available with few ethical issues [25]. Therefore, they might be a novel source of cell therapy for diabetes. Three studies used UC-MSCs transplantation for the treatment of T2DM in humans. One study showed that combined intravenous and intrapancreatic endovascular injection of UC-MSCs with a 5 day interval decreased HbA1c levels and insulin dose in patients with T2DM at 6 months post-treatment (41% of the patients became insulin-independent; 29% of the patients showed reduced insulin requirement by ≥ 50%). However, these indices deteriorated in the following 3–6 months [18]. In another study, 18 patients with T2DM received intravenous transfusion of UC-MSCs three times with 2-week intervals for 6 months. The results showed that 8 out of 18 patients were responsive to the treatment, manifested by reduced fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels; however, no significant difference was observed in insulin dose before and after treatment [19]. In another trial, six patients with T2DM were treated with intravenous transfusion of UC-MSCs two times with 2-week intervals and followed for ≥ 24 months. Three out of six patients became insulin-free between 25 and 43 months. The remaining patients continued to require insulin injections, although with a reduced dose [20]. These studies preliminarily confirmed the efficacy of UC-MSCs for the treatment of T2DM. However, the results of insulin requirement following treatment were not consistent. In this double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study, more patients in the UC-MSCs group achieved the primary endpoint at 48 weeks following treatment compared with the placebo group, and insulin requirement decreased following UC-MSCs treatment in a time-dependent manner, which suggested the efficacy of UC-MSCs treatment for T2DM. However, the percentage of insulin reduction and the proportion of patients with insulin-free in our UC-MSCs group was lower than those reported in other studies, which might be explained by the heterogeneity of enrolled subjects.",
        "Previous studies showed that the HbA1c levels of patients with T2DM progressively declined by 1.2% after UC-MSCs transplantation, with a maximum decrease observed at 3 and 6 months following treatment, and slightly increased at 12-month [18]. In the present study, the HbA1c levels of the UC-MSCs group decreased 1.31% and the percentage of patients achieved the target HbA1c levels (< 7%) was the highest (55.56%) at 9 weeks and was maintained at approximately 40% during follow-up. The trend of HbA1c changes in our UC-MSCs group was similar to that published in other studies using UC-MSCs transplantation for patients with T2DM. In addition, our UC-MSCs infusion achieved a similar reduction in HbA1c levels compared with other common hypoglycemic agents to treat T2DM, which confirmed the high efficacy of UC-MSCs for the treatment of T2DM.",
        "Animal studies showed that MSCs transplantation increased the levels of insulin and C-peptide in type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM by promoting the replication of residual β-cells, improving the autophagy function of islets, promoting the phenotypic dedifferentiation of islet β-cells and the polarization repair of macrophages in the local microenvironment of islets [26, 27]. In addition, some clinical studies have explored the effects of UC-MSCs on islet β-cell function of patients with T2DM. They found that fasting serum C-peptide levels progressively increased to the peak value at 6 months following UC-MSCs transplantation and then slightly decreased at 12 months, while no significant difference was observed in OGTT 2 h postprandial C-peptide levels at baseline and 12-month post-treatment [18]. Likewise, another study found no significant changes in plasma C-peptide levels at four time points (OGTT 0, 1, 2, and 3 h) after UC-MSCs infusion [19]. Consistently, no significant improvement in fasting plasma C-peptide levels in the UC-MSCs group was observed. Glucagon-stimulated C-peptide levels and AUCC-pep temporarily increased and then gradually decreased to the baseline levels after UC-MSCs infusion. Animal studies revealed that β-cell dedifferentiation rather than apoptosis was the predominant contributor to T2DM. UC-MSCs therapy was a promising strategy for reversing β-cell dedifferentiation in T2DM. Because the reversal effect of UC-MSCs was more robust at the early stages of β-cell differentiation [28], the improvement in islet β-cell function was not obvious in the patients that had the disease for a long time.",
        "MSCs infusion has been shown to reduce insulin resistance in animal T2DM models. BM-MSCs infusion ameliorated insulin resistance of rats with T2DM by activating the insulin receptor substrate 1/protein kinase B signaling pathways [9]. UC-MSCs reduced insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic rats by eliciting adipose tissue macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype [29]. In addition, adipose-derived MSCs improved hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic rats by regulating hepatic glucose metabolism [30]. It has been reported that UC-MSCs improved insulin resistance in the liver and adipose tissues of rats with T2DM by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation [31]. Few clinical studies have focused on the effect of UC-MSCs on insulin resistance in T2DM. In the present study, we demonstrated that UC-MSCs infusion significantly alleviated insulin resistance in a time-dependent manner, which indicated that UC-MSCs treatment was effective at improving insulin resistance in T2DM.",
        "The therapeutic effects of UC-MSCs have been reported in a variety of diseases and no obvious adverse effects were reported [32, 33]. In our study, one patient suffered from cerebral infarction due to a long history of uncontrolled hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which was not related to UC-MSCs infusion, and no cell-related immunological reactions or tumor formation was identified. The safety assessment indicated that the administration of UC-MSCs via intravenous infusion was well tolerated in patients with T2DM. Further observations of possible transplant complications are required.",
        "This study was a single-center trial that recruited a small number of Chinese patients. The age, course of T2DM, condition of islet β-cell function, and insulin resistance of the enrolled subjects were highly heterogeneous. Therefore, the results could not be extended to all patients with T2DM. Since our patients were followed for a short period, long-term follow-up is needed to validate the current findings. Future well-controlled studies with an increased number of cases are required to clarify the efficacy and safety of intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs for the treatment of T2DM.",
        "This prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial suggests that UC-MSCs administration via intravenous infusion is a safe and effective approach that could reduce exogenous insulin requirement and could alleviate insulin resistance in patients with T2DM. UC-MSCs transplantation could be a potential therapeutic option for T2DM.",

However, an accurate test still lacks for the early detection of graft rejection. Blood samples were prospectively collected in four university centers (Geneva, Grenoble, Montpellier, and Strasbourg). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with donor splenocytes in the presence of interleukin-2. After 24 h of incubation, interferon- (IFN-) ELISpot analysis was performed. After a total of 5 days of incubation, cell proliferation was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis for Ki-67. Immunological events were correlated with adverse metabolic events determined by loss of 1 point of -score and/or an increased insulin intake 10%. Twenty-five patients were analyzed; 14 were recipients of islets alone, and 11 combined with kidney. Overall, 76% (19/25) reached insulin independence at one point during a mean follow-up of 30.7 months. IFN- ELISpot showed no detectable correlation with adverse metabolic events [area under the curve (AUC)=0.57]. Similarly, cell proliferation analysis showed no detectable correlation with adverse metabolic events (CD3+/CD4+ AUC=0.54; CD3+/CD8+ AUC=0.55; CD3/CD56+ AUC=0.50). CD3/CD56+ cell proliferation was significantly higher in patients with combined kidney transplantation versus islet alone (6 months, p=0.010; 12 months, p=0.016; and 24 months, p=0.018). Donor antigen-stimulated IFN- production and cell proliferation do not predict adverse metabolic events after islet transplantation. This suggests that the volume of transplanted islets is too small to produce a detectable systemic immune response and/or that alloimmune rejection is not the sole reason for the loss of islet graft function.

        "Diabetes mellitus encompasses a group of chronic and progressive metabolic disorders with various causes, distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment options. The main pathophysiological disturbances involve impaired carbohydrate metabolism, leading to reduced glucose utilization in peripheral tissues, along with inappropriate gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, resulting in hyperglycemia. Although there are different subtypes of diabetes, reflecting the heterogeneity of the condition, the diagnostic criteria primarily rely on elevated blood glucose levels and increased A1c as a surrogate marker [1,2].",
        "The hallmark of diabetes is chronic hyperglycemia, which is associated with a range of acute and chronic complications. Despite modern treatment options, these complications remain a significant cause of disability and premature death in both developed and developing countries. Diabetes, as a group of heterogeneous disorders, can be classified into distinct types, including type 1, type 2, gestational diabetes mellitus, and other specific types caused by factors such as genetic mutations, exocrine pancreatic disorders, endocrine diseases, or medications [2].",
        "The most common type of diabetes is type 2 (T2DM), followed by type 1 (T1DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). T2DM accounts for over 90% of cases worldwide, while GDM is generally limited to pregnancy. T1DM, although less common, affects more than 9 million people globally. It poses a substantial burden due to its treatment complexity and the risk of both acute and chronic complications [2,3].",
        "T1DM results from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells, leading to insulin deficiency. For patients with a substantial loss of β-cell number and function, insulin treatment is necessary to prevent acute, life-threatening complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis [4]. Over time, if blood glucose control is not optimal, microvascular and macrovascular complications may develop. Microvascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, are now the leading causes of blindness, non-traumatic limb amputations, and the need for kidney replacement therapy in developed countries. In addition, macrovascular complications, including myocardial infarction and stroke, are significant contributors to disability and premature death in these patients [5].",
        "Despite recent advancements in the treatment of clinical and even preclinical T1DM—including the development of insulin analogues, automated insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring systems, closed-loop insulin delivery systems, and teplizumab (a humanized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody approved for delaying the onset of clinically apparent T1DM)—managing the condition remains a significant burden for patients, requiring constant blood sugar monitoring and adjustments [6,7]. Figure 1 illustrates the currently available treatment options for clinically apparent T1DM. In addition, the constant care required to manage diabetes can lead to psychological challenges, known as diabetes distress. This refers to the emotional strain caused by living with the disease and the burden of continuous daily self-management, which can hinder optimal glucose regulation and clinical outcomes, and further reduce the quality of life [8].",
        "Pancreas transplantation (PTx) and pancreatic islet transplantation (IT) offer advanced approaches for treating and potentially curing diabetes [9]. These procedures are currently reserved mainly for a specific group of diabetic patients who suffer from severe and recurrent hypoglycemic episodes while on insulin therapy. As a result, to avoid hypoglycemia, these patients may reduce or omit insulin, which prevents them from maintaining strict glycemic control. This significantly increases their risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis as well as chronic microvascular and macrovascular complications, limiting their life expectancy and quality of life [5]. For these reasons, therapeutic approaches that aim to restore endogenous insulin production offer a promising solution [9,10].",
        "Although these options have been established in clinical medicine for several decades, they still face significant limitations, including inconsistent success in achieving insulin independence, risks associated with immunosuppression, potential malignancies, and ethical concerns. As a result, innovative approaches such as stem cell-derived islet transplantation to promote β-cell regeneration and protection are being actively explored.",
        "This review aims to: (1) summarize the current evidence on achieving insulin independence through various transplantation methods of insulin-producing cells in patients with type 1 diabetes; (2) compare insulin independence rates across whole-pancreas transplantation, islet cell transplantation, and stem cell transplantation; and (3) identify the limitations, challenges and potential future directions associated with these techniques.",

        "We conducted a comprehensive search for clinical studies reporting insulin independence as the ultimate goal of various pancreas transplantation techniques, including whole-pancreas transplantation, islet transplantation, and stem cell-derived therapeutic options.

        "A paper was excluded if it lacked data or information on achieved insulin independence in the specified patient group, if the follow-up period was shorter than one year, or if the patient cohort was smaller than the prespecified size.

The details of these questions are described elsewhere [11]. The outcomes for each included study are presented in Table 1.",
        "A key characteristic of these 48 studies is their small sample size: 32 studies included fewer than 50 participants, while another 12 had between 51 and 100 participants. In 14 of the 48 included studies, potential bias related to inclusion criteria was identified, such as using data from registries that may not cover the entire study population and the lack of information regarding T1DM duration. Among the seven studies reporting on AHSC transplantation, five lacked a control group of patients with newly diagnosed T1DM, which hinders the quality of these manuscripts. Finally, three studies reported a significant proportion of patients lost to follow-up.",
        "PTx restores an autoregulating gland that produces endogenous insulin, responsive to normal feedback mechanisms. In PTx, the donor pancreas is implanted in an ectopic location, typically in the lower abdomen. It is usually surgically connected to the recipient’s small intestine—rarely the bladder—to drain digestive enzymes from the exocrine pancreas, minimizing surgical complications [9,60]. In the ideal scenario, PTx improves glycemic variability and eliminates hypoglycemic episodes, restores normal glucose homeostasis without insulin use, ameliorates chronic diabetic complications, and enhances both quality of life and life expectancy. Additionally, a successful PTx supports the secretion of counterregulatory hormones and restores exocrine pancreatic function [61,62].",
        "The first PTx was performed in 1966, and since then, significant experience has been gained. Today, PTx is recognized as an established therapeutic option for patients with brittle diabetes. While more than 80% of PTx procedures are performed in patients with T1DM, PTx has increasingly been used in patients with other forms of diabetes, such as T2DM and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes [9,10].",
        "Several strategies for PTx were developed, including simultaneous pancreas and kidney (SPK) transplants, pancreas-after-kidney (PAK) transplants, and pancreas transplants alone (PTA). In relatively rare cases, PTx is combined with lung or liver transplantation, predominantly in patients with cystic fibrosis. Pancreas transplantation has also been described in patients with post-pancreatectomy diabetes. In such cases, the pancreatic graft was able to restore both insulin production and digestive enzyme secretion [9,63,64]. Nevertheless, SPK remains the most commonly performed PTx procedure in patients with T1DM. Patients undergoing this type of surgery benefit most from PTx, as they would already need to undergo major surgery and immunosuppression for renal transplantation [63]. Conversely, patients with T1DM and renal failure who underwent SPK transplantation had better outcomes, with reduced 10- and 20-year mortality rates compared to those who received only a kidney transplant, according to a Dutch nationwide cohort study [65].",
        "Other strategies for PTx, such as PAK and PTA, are used less frequently. PAK typically involves two independent donors and procedures: a living kidney donor, who may be related to the patient, and a separate deceased donor for the pancreas, adding complexity to the overall process. Meanwhile, PTA was traditionally reserved for patients with T1DM who had preserved kidney function. Both strategies have historically been associated with higher mortality rates compared to patients remaining on the waiting list, leading to their less frequent utilization [61,66,67].",
        "In the past, PTx was generally regarded as a procedure associated with a high rate of early allograft loss, frequent complications, and significant morbidity. In the meantime, surgical techniques, strategies, and immunosuppression protocols for PTx have significantly evolved, with the aim of reducing surgical complications such as thrombosis, pancreatitis, infections, hemorrhage, and fistula formation, as well as minimizing graft rejection, infections and organ toxicity [68,69]. As a result, outcomes for PTx have improved significantly, with patient survival rates now ranging from 96% to 98% at one year and approximately 90% at five years across all PTx categories. In contrast, only 60% of patients with T1DM on the waiting list for SPK transplantation remain alive after 5 years [61,70].",
        "More recent data indicate that over 80% of patients have a functioning pancreas graft for more than five years following PTx, and approximately 75% maintain function after 10 years [71]. The latest reports indicate that insulin independence rates, as a favorable metabolic outcome, are observed in over 90% of patients in the short to medium term, but these rates tend to decline during longer follow-up periods. Data on reported insulin independence rates, study population sizes, and follow-up periods are summarized in Table 2.",
        "However, since large, high-volume centers in the US and EU have reported better outcomes compared to smaller centers, it is possible that center size, along with the year of the study and the available technological and immunosuppressive support at the time, could affect the published results [60,72].",
        "Contemporary challenges in PTx include the limited number of suitable donors and geographic disparities in access to high-volume centers and transplantable pancreases. Currently, graft survival rates are similar between pancreases taken from donors after circulatory death and brain death, expanding the potential pool of organs available for transplantation. Previously, brain death donors were considered more favorable for graft survival. Additionally, networks like Eurotransplant and allocation systems in the US have improved access to PTx by reducing waiting times and addressing some of the geographic disparities in transplant availability. Moreover, a higher annual volume of PTx at certain centers is expected to contribute to better outcomes, although available data do not clearly define a minimum annual volume. This outcome can also be influenced by various geographical factors, as well as donor and recipient selection [63,73,74,75].",
        "It is important to note that despite steadily improving outcomes and broader recipient selection criteria, the number of PTx procedures performed has declined in recent years. This decline can be attributed to a prolonged lack of consensus criteria, the absence of a primary referral source, limited acceptance among diabetes care professionals, and challenges related to access, education, and resources within the transplantation process. Additionally, the development of less invasive procedures, such as pancreatic islet transplantation, may have contributed to this trend [63,73,75].",
        "In contrast to PTx, pancreatic IT was developed as a less invasive procedure, typically involving the infusion of islet cells from a donor pancreas into the portal vein or omental vessels. The use of islet cells increased the availability of donor pancreata by allowing the utilization of organs that are not suitable for whole-organ transplantation. Major complications typically associated with surgery are largely avoided, with bleeding being the most common complication [76]. It has been used in humans since the 1980s, but results remained unsatisfactory until improvements were made in the 2000s. These advancements included better donor selection, improvements in the quantity and quality of transplanted islets, and the introduction of less toxic corticosteroid-free immunosuppressant protocols [73,77,78]. The greater availability of donor pancreases and the avoidance of major surgery have increased the number of potential recipients. As a result, unlike PTx, most procedures involve islet transplantation alone (ITA), while islet-after-kidney (IAK) transplantation is less common, and simultaneous islet-kidney (SIK) transplantation is rare [9].",
        "Deceased donors (cadavers) are the primary source of human islets for transplantation, and procedures can be repeated by combining islets from multiple donors. The surgical procedure is considered less invasive compared to whole-organ pancreas transplantation and can be performed either via transhepatic percutaneous infusion or omental vein cannulation under radiologic guidance. The islets are infused into the portal vein system, where they become engrafted in the liver. Following a successful procedure, glucose stability is typically achieved within days to weeks, while insulin independence occurs later, once the islets are fully engrafted and revascularized in their new environment [27]. The success of IT has improved over time, with a steadily increasing proportion of patients achieving insulin independence. However, insulin independence rates remain lower than those achieved with PTx, and multiple IT procedures are sometimes required for clinical success. Notable advances in IT success became evident as early as 2012, when data from the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry were published. However, as reported in this paper, long-term insulin independence was achieved in less than 50% of IT recipients [36].",
        "Historically, the first larger trial reviewed that reported insulin independence rates above 50% was published in 2016. This phase III multicenter clinical trial involved 48 patients with T1DM who experienced severe hypoglycemia and received one or more islet IT procedures. The study’s primary endpoint was defined somewhat differently, as HbA1c levels below 7.0% and the absence of severe hypoglycemic events from day 28 to day 365, which was achieved by 87.5% of the participants. An insulin independence rate of 52.1 at day 365 was reported [27].",
        "Recently, several large studies on the long-term outcomes of IT have been published. One study, involving patients from the Edmonton Centre who underwent IT, reported that insulin independence was achieved in 78.6% of recipients, with a mean duration of insulin independence of 2.1 years [12]. The same authors previously reported more favorable outcomes in patients with surviving grafts, defined as fasting plasma C-peptide levels greater than 0.1 nmol/L. In these patients, insulin independence rates reached 90%. In contrast, patients with failed graft survival had poorer outcomes, with only 53% achieving insulin independence [17]. The data on reported insulin independence rates, study population sizes, and follow-up periods are presented in Table 3.",
        "Factors associated with favorable outcomes in IT were identified in a cohort of 398 patients with T1DM. Four key factors were determined: recipient age of 35 years or older, a total of at least 325,000 islet equivalents (IEQ) infused, induction immunosuppression with T cell depletion and/or TNF-α inhibition, and maintenance therapy with both mTOR inhibitors and calcineurin inhibitors. After 5 years, 53% of patients who met these criteria were insulin independent and exhibited significantly better blood glucose control [14].",
        "A recent multicenter retrospective study of 1210 patients who received either IT alone or IT after kidney transplantation demonstrated a linear independent relationship between primary graft survival,—measured by the Beta 2 score (a complex index incorporating fasting blood glucose, C-peptide, HbA1c, and insulin dose as indicators of graft function)—and 5-year adverse clinical outcomes of IT [79]. These outcomes included unsuccessful IT, graft exhaustion, inadequate glucose control, and the need for exogenous insulin therapy. The study also identified other relevant factors, such as the characteristics of the recipient and transplanted islets and the transplantation strategies and immunosuppression regimens used [13].",
        "Some clinical difficulties related to IT in the liver still need to be addressed. While the intraportal infusion site is easily accessible, islet infusion triggers a proinflammatory and procoagulatory host response, which can lead to islet loss and IT failure [80]. Therefore, alternative sites for IT are being explored, such as the bone marrow, subcutaneous tissue and the omentum, where biological scaffolds may be used to protect the transplanted islets from immune destruction [81,82]. In addition, immunosuppressant drugs like tacrolimus and cyclosporine, used for maintenance therapy, reach significantly higher concentrations in the portal circulation compared to systemic blood flow, resulting in toxic effects on the transplanted beta cells [83].",
        "Immunosuppression remains another significant challenge for successful IT. Typically, T-cell-depleting agents, along with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) inhibitors and anti-CD3 antibodies, are used for immunosuppression induction. Although introduced later, anakinra and etanercept used during the induction phase have been associated with more favorable outcomes in the Edmonton study [17]. Maintenance requires a two-drug regimen, with tacrolimus or ciclosporin as critical components, combined with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, co-stimulation inhibitors such as efalizumab or belatacept may be used in patients prone to renal injury [9,84]. In terms of clinical outcomes, these immunosuppression protocols have resulted in improved insulin independence rates, although some patients required more than one islet transplantation to achieve clinical success [29]. As with pancreas transplantation (PTx), immunosuppression was associated with an increased risk of infections and tumorogenesis [68,69].",
        "Lastly, the legal regulation of islet cells varies across the world. In the United States, islets cells are regulated as a manufactured biologic product and need to be administered under an Investigational New Drug Application. This led to the development and recent approval of donislecel, the first allogenic cell-based therapy for T1DM, granted by the FDA, after clinical trials showed efficacy [85]. According to data published on ClinicalTrials.gov, a Phase 3 clinical trial involving 21 patients with T1DM reported that 19 patients experienced no severe hypoglycemic events at the one-year follow-up on day 365. Additionally, 19 out of 21 patients achieved HbA1c levels of ≤6.5%, with approximately half becoming insulin-independent. It is recommended that patients undergoing this therapy take immunosuppressive medications to prevent rejection by their immune system [86]. In contrast, allogenic islet cell administration in the European Union is regulated similar to whole-organ transplantation and does not require clinical trial authorization or marketing review by a regulatory authority.",
        "The limited availability of pancreatic islets still poses a challenge to the further development of IT. However, modern technology enables the use of various types of stem cells. Although these cells are less differentiated than mature islet cells, they have a favorable ability to proliferate and differentiate later, making them a promising source for direct transplantation or in vitro islet farming. Autologous hematopoietic stem cells (AHSCs), human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are being investigated in this area.",
        "While clinical experience with ESCs and iPSCs remains limited, several papers report clinically successful AHSC transplantations in patients with newly diagnosed T1DM. These cells are typically used in newly diagnosed patients with T1DM after AHSC mobilization with cyclophosphamide and granulocyte growth factor, followed by collection through apheresis procedures and immunologic conditioning using cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte serum or fludarabine. Typically, a single procedure is conducted [29]. The exact mechanism of ADSCs in autoimmune diseases is still under debate. Possible mechanisms include active or passive tolerance, T-regulatory cell suppression, or clonal deletion. It appears that these procedures work efficiently, at least in newly diagnosed T1DM, by prolonging the naturally occurring honeymoon phase in these patients [49]. However, at least in non-diabetic adults, the contribution of ADSCs to beta cell mass is marginal, as hematopoietic stem cells derived from adult donors are not a source of pancreatic beta cells in adult non-diabetic humans [87]. Studies on AHSC in T1DM are shown in Table 4.",
        "However, it is important to note that the side effects of the immunologic protocols include, but are not limited to, neutropenic fever, bone marrow suppression, and even death. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether using selected and better-characterized subsets of hematopoietic stem cells may provide greater benefits with fewer risks.",
        "Another type of stem cells, ESCs are derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts and have the capacity for extensive self-renewal, as well as the ability to differentiate into cell types from all three germ layers. In contrast, iPSCs are created by reprogramming somatic cells, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells, dermal fibroblasts or adipocytes, back into a pluripotent state using specific factors. Pioneering research in 2014 successfully derived glucose-responsive, insulin-secreting cells that were capable of improving glucose control when transplanted into mice, and later in humans. As a result, ESCs and iPSCs can be produced in reasonable quantities and subsequently used to generate pancreatic endocrine cells by mimicking the molecular mechanisms that regulate pancreatic development in vivo, and first clinical experiences are reported [86]. The first protocols were developed more than ten years ago and have been tested in vitro and in animal models with encouraging results [88,89,90].",
        "Immune rejection is a great challenge to be overcome in transplanting these type of cells, so several approaches have been tested to overcome it. Techniques such as cell encapsulation have been explored to create a barrier that protects the recipient from invading donor cells to a certain extent while safeguarding the donor cells from infiltrating immune cells. Additionally, these devices can physically restrict off-target cells and, when placed in appropriate locations, offer additional advantages, such as being accessible for environmental modifications and retrievable for analysis or safety assessments. Modified perforated encapsulation has been shown to allow for capillary ingrowth, enhancing the supply of nutrients and oxygen, which increases beta cell survival. However, this also exposes the β cells to the host immune system, necessitating the continued use of immunosuppression protocols to prevent immune-mediated rejection [91]. Several relatively small clinical trials have been published, but despite some promising results, insulin independence was not achieved in any of the study participants.",
        "The first multicenter, open-label clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of pancreatic endoderm cells derived from human ESCs in macroencapsulated devices implanted subcutaneously was published in 2018. These cells were delivered in encapsulation devices designed to protect them from host-versus-graft reactions using a cell-impermeable layer. However, cell survival was inconsistent, and no clinically relevant insulin secretion was observed after a two-year follow-up. Additionally, the devices triggered a foreign body response in the host [92]. A subsequent paper on human EPC-derived pancreatic endoderm cells transplanted in patients with type T1DM described a study group of 17 patients participating in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. All participants received pluripotent stem cell-derived pancreatic endoderm cells within a macroencapsulation device implanted subcutaneously, along with immunosuppression. In most patients, engraftment and insulin production were observed, with approximately one-third of the group demonstrating positive circulating C-peptide levels six months after the procedure. These initial data suggested that stem cell-based approaches may offer a scalable and renewable alternative to pancreatic islet transplants [93].",
        "In a similar Phase 1/2 clinical trial involving patients T1DM, a non-immunoprotective macroencapsulation device containing human EPC-derived pancreatic endoderm cells was implanted subcutaneously in 15 individuals, alongside an immunosuppression regimen. These patients were followed for one year. The implants were well tolerated, with no severe graft-related adverse events. After implantation, patients exhibited increases in both fasting and glucose-responsive C-peptide levels, as well as mixed meal-stimulated C-peptide secretion. Explanted grafts showed cells with a mature β-cell phenotype that were immunoreactive for insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide, and MAF bZIP transcription factor A (MafA). Although no patient achieved insulin independence, better glucose regulation was observed, with reduced insulin requirements [94].",
        "Two years later, in a follow-up clinical trial, 10 patients received two to three times more encapsulation devices containing more human EPC-derived pancreatic precursor cells implanted subcutaneously compared to previous studies, aiming to enhance the therapeutic effect. The immunosuppressive protocol included anti-thymocyte globulin for induction, followed by maintenance with mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus. By the 6th month, four patients exhibited detectable C-peptide levels, with clinically significant circulating C-peptide levels (greater than 0.1 nmol/L) observed in three patients. In these individuals, continuous glucose monitoring showed improved glucose regulation and decreased demand for exogenous insulin by the 9th month, and no severe hypoglycemic events. The single patient who developed detectable, but clinically insignificant C-peptide levels showed no improvements in glucose regulation [91].",
        "Recently, a manuscript was published detailing a one-year follow-up of a single patient who received autologous iPSC-derived islets implanted subcutaneously, accompanied by an immunosuppressive treatment protocol. The patient, who had T1DM, achieved insulin independence approximately two and a half months after the islets were implanted, with improved glucose regulation parameters, such as HbA1c and time in range. At the one-year mark, the time in range exceeded 98% [73].",
        "Considering directions for future research, the ideal beta cell therapy would not only generate an satisfactory supply of functional beta cells but also avoid immune reactions, including autoimmunity and tissue rejection. Consequently, the ultimate goal for the widespread clinical use of stem cell-derived islets is to bioengineer hypoimmunogenic cells capable of evading the immune response. This approach would eliminate the need for long-term or lifelong immunosuppressive therapy while ensuring adequate insulin secretion [95,96].",
        "Advances in transplantation and genetic technologies offer significant therapeutic potential for patients with T1DM. Still, they raise complex ethical considerations that must balance scientific progress with moral and societal values. These interventions demand robust ethical oversight, transparent patient education, and equitable access to ensure fair and ethical implementation. Pancreas transplantation involves ethical concerns surrounding donor organ allocation and patient selection. The scarcity of donor organs on one hand, and wider indications with broader patient selection for transplantation, necessitate stringent prioritization, raising questions about fairness and equity in access. Furthermore, pancreas transplantation is still widely restricted to cadavers, although transplantations from living donors are mentioned in the literature [97]. Transplantation involving living donors raises questions about the particular relationship between the recipient and the donor, with a particular focus on the potential for donor exploitation. Additionally, the long-term need for immunosuppressive drugs after transplantation poses significant risks, such as increased susceptibility to infections and other complications. Patients must fully understand and consent to these long-term implications [98].",
        "Although pancreatic islet transplantation is less invasive than full organ transplantation, ethical concerns remain. These include using multiple donor pancreata as islet sources, recipient selection and the requirement for immunosuppressive drugs. Equity in access to these therapies is also a pressing issue. In addition, the risk of graft failure and the need for additional transplantations must be addressed. Therefore, the patient needs to be fully informed about the benefits and risks associated with the procedure. Ideally, these procedures should be provided first and foremost to patients who stand to benefit the most [99].",
        "On the other hand, stem cell transplantation offers the potential to overcome some donor-related ethical concerns, as cells can often be harvested from embryos, fetuses, living donors or even the patients themselves, theoretically offering broader availability. However, sourcing heterologous stem cells, particularly embryonic and fetal stem cells, raises ethical issues. In particular, the ethical dilemma surrounding the destruction of human embryos has been, and continues to be, a significant factor slowing the development of hESC-based clinical therapies. Similarly, fetal stem cells, often derived from aborted fetuses or miscarriages, raise ethical concerns about the moral status of the fetus and the acceptability of using these cells in research and therapy.",
        "The development of autologous stem cell transplantation and the use of iPSCs have largely addressed this ethical concern. However, significant challenges persist in the clinical translation of these methods. The unlimited differentiation potential of stem cells, coupled with the risks of unintended differentiation and malignant transformation, continues to pose major safety concerns. The same applies to the risks associated with immunosuppressive protocols [100].",
        "Therefore, collaboration among ethicists, clinicians, and policymakers is essential to navigating the moral landscape of these interventions. Transparency about the cell sources, robust informed consent processes, and adherence to strict regulations are critical to mitigating these concerns. Striking a balance between fostering innovation, minimizing harm, respecting human dignity, and preventing misuse will be crucial to ensuring these technologies benefit all patients equitably [101].",
        "Although PTx, IT, and stem cell-based therapies for T1DM have been performed globally for a substantial period, and considerable experience and evidence have been gathered, several limitations exist in the papers included in this review.",
        "The main limitation is the relatively small sample sizes, which reflect the stringent criteria for these treatments. Despite the small sample sizes, a wide range of findings has emerged from the manuscripts included in this review, depending on the study goals. These findings include various confounding factors affecting insulin independence and the impact of these therapies on other organs, such as the heart. Given the small sample sizes, a significant issue is the loss of study participants to follow-up, as missing data can considerably impact the study findings.",
        "In some studies, particularly those involving newly diagnosed patients with T1DM, the inclusion of a control group receiving standard treatment could enhance the validity of the findings. This is important because the study treatment may interfere with the naturally occurring honeymoon period and the associated temporary insulin independence in these patients. However, in cohort studies reporting on patients with long-standing T1DM, a control group is not necessary when analyzing insulin independence, as this outcome cannot be achieved without some form of transplantation therapy.",
        "Studies reporting data from large registries face specific issues, such as data protection regulations, including patient consent and other legal considerations for using this data for scientific purposes. Although unlikely, these issues may hinder data quality, in addition to the challenges posed by the retrospective design of such studies.",
        "Furthermore, the reporting of insulin independence across studies was inconsistent and varied significantly depending on study aims and protocols. Some studies reported on short-term insulin independence, while others focused on sustained insulin independence, reflecting a lack of consensus in this area. Additionally, other relevant outcomes of transplantation therapies for T1DM include decreased insulin requirements, reduced glucose variability, increased time in range as detected by continuous glucose monitoring, and a decreased rate of microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, these outcomes were not consistently reported in the selected studies.",
        "PTx and IT are procedures aimed at restoring insulin production and improving blood glucose management in individuals with brittle diabetes. PTx involves the surgical replacement of pancreatic function with a cadaveric pancreas. This procedure can be performed as a standalone operation or in conjunction with the transplantation of other organs, most commonly the kidney. IT involves isolating insulin-producing islet cells from a donor pancreas and infusing them into the recipient’s body, primarily into the liver. This procedure is less invasive than a full pancreas transplant. The latest transplantation technique, AHSCT, seems to be reserved for patients with newly diagnosed T1DM, modifying the autoimmune response and thus avoiding further pancreatic islet deterioration. The benefits of all three types of transplantation include improved blood glucose control and a reduced need for exogenous insulin, with insulin independence as the ideal outcome. This outcome is more likely to be achieved in patients undergoing Tx compared to those undergoing other transplantation methods.",
        "Despite their advantages, these procedures present several challenges. The risk of rejection of the transplanted allogenic tissues necessitates immunosuppressive therapy, which carries risks of infections and other side effects. Surgical risks, such as infection and bleeding, are also concerns in pancreas transplantation. Furthermore, the limited availability of suitable donor pancreases can lead to long waiting times for candidates. In addition, AHSCT involves aggressive procedures necessary for stem cell harvesting, and the accompanying immunosuppression protocols carry substantial risks of complications.",
        "Ongoing research in PTx and IT focuses on improving the success rates and safety of these procedures. Key areas of investigation include the exploration of regenerative medicine to generate insulin-producing cells from stem cells, the development of improved immunosuppressive protocols and immunoprotective devices that minimize side effects, and the investigation of anti-inflammatory therapies to protect islet cells during and after transplantation. Furthermore, this field of research could benefit from a broad consensus on success criteria and standardized reporting, which would allow for more concise comparisons among different studies.",

    "title": "Long-term outcomes of pancreatic islet transplantation alone in type 1 diabetes: a 20-year single-centre study in Italy. restoring endogenous insulin production. However, its success relies on balancing improved glycaemic control with the risks of immunosuppressive therapy. This study aimed to evaluate long-term outcomes of islet transplantation alone for type 1 diabetes, focusing on the effects of islet mass and immunosuppressive regimens on graft survival and insulin independence, and weighing glycaemic control benefits against the risks of immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: This cohort study retrospectively analysed individuals aged 18-67 years with type 1 diabetes who received intraportal islet transplantation alone at IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy. Inclusion criteria comprised adults with type 1 diabetes diagnosed before the age of 55 years with severe recurrent hypoglycaemia or glycaemic instability. Major exclusion criteria included a HbA(1c) of more than 12.5%, a BMI of more than 30 kg/m(2), and insulin requirements exceeding 1.2 IU/kg per day, along with contraindications to immunosuppressive therapy. Participants were recruited from the hospital's islet transplant registry. Follow-up was conducted through regular clinical visits, with data collected retrospectively. Outcomes assessed included patient survival, graft survival, insulin independence, glycaemic control, and adverse events. Data were analysed using an intention-to-treat method, mixed-effects models, Kaplan-Meier estimates, and Cox and logistic regression to identify factors linked to metabolic success and reduced risks. FINDINGS: 79 patients underwent intrahepatic or intraportal islet transplantation alone between Feb 16, 2001, and June 1, 2023, and received a total of 159 islet infusions, with a median total islet mass of 9637 islet equivalents (IEQ) per kg. Complications were infrequent and mostly involved minor bleeding, with only 3% (two of 79) of patients requiring surgical intervention. Glycaemic control improved significantly after infusion, with a reduction of HbA(1c) by -10.04 mmol/mol (-13.63 to -6.46), and a decrease in daily insulin requirements by -13.35 units per day (-17.04 to -9.65). The intention-to-treat analysis showed a median graft survival (fasting C peptide >/=0.3 ng/mL) of 3.9 years (95% CI 1.6 to 6.2) and 44% (35/79) insulin independence for a median of 6 years (95% CI 2.88 to 9.08). Patients receiving more than 10 000 IEQ/kg with BAS, FK506, and Rapa therapy had a median graft survival of 9.7 years (3.1-16.0) and 73% (16 of 22) insulin independence. Kaplan-Meier estimates indicated graft survival rates of 86% at 1 year, 65% at 5 years, 47% at 10 years, 47% at 15 years, and 40% at 20 years. Overall survival was 92% (73 of 79) over a median follow-up of 13.1 years, with a 20-year survival probability of 84%. Adverse events related to immunosuppressive therapy were reported in 44% (35 of 79) of patients, with allosensitisation rates increasing from 6% at baseline to 42% after therapy discontinuation. INTERPRETATION: This analysis of a large islet transplantation alone cohort provides valuable insights into factors influencing outcomes and highlights potential risks, supporting informed clinical decision making and the optimisation of future beta-cell replacement strategies.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of insulin‐producing β‐cells in the pancreas. Despite advances in insulin therapy and β‐cell replacement, a definitive cure addressing the underlying cause of the disease, that is the loss of immune tolerance to β‐cells remains elusive. Emerging strategies to reshape the immune response to pancreatic autoantigens include the adoptive transfer of ex vivo cultured regulatory cells, either mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), or dendritic cells (DCs), collectively known as regulatory cell therapy. This review aims to provide an overview of the regulatory cell‐based approaches for T1D currently under development. Although several clinical trials have demonstrated the safety of in vivo administration of regulatory cells to T1D patients, only mild signs of efficacy have been reported. The most promising results were observed in patients with shorter disease duration and higher residual β‐cell mass, suggesting that early interventions may result in clinical benefit. Significant challenges remain, including the long‐term efficacy and stability of the infused products. In the future, approaches combining regulatory cell‐based therapies with immunomodulatory agents or strategies to restore the damaged insulin‐producing cells may hold the key to achieving a functional cure for T1D.",

        "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the selective destruction of insulin‐producing β‐cells, primarily driven by autoreactive T cells, with consequent insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia [1]. Current management relies on exogenous insulin therapy, which comes with the limitations of continuously monitoring blood glucose levels and progressively increasing the regimen's dose [2]. Clinical trials have shown that a short course of Teplizumab significantly delayed the progression to clinical T1D in high‐risk, nondiabetic relatives of individuals with T1D [3] and significantly improved stimulated C‐peptide levels in individuals newly diagnosed with T1D [4]. These results lead to the approval of Teplizumab, the first drug to treat T1D patients, offering a novel therapeutic option to alter the disease course by preserving β‐cell function and delaying disease progression.",
        "Several approaches have been proposed to replace the destroyed insulin‐producing cells, consisting of islet transplantation [5] or improving metabolic control by administering insulin in combination with hypoglycaemic drugs [6]. Pancreatic islet transplantation has been successfully applied with the Edmonton Protocol since the early 2000s in patients with unstable glycemic control [7]. The safety and efficacy of the procedure have been widely proven [8]. Still, its application is limited by the low number of donors’ pancreas available, the low efficiency of islet purification procedures, and the need for lifelong immunosuppression [2, 5]. To overcome these limitations, new islet transplantation sites, encapsulation systems [9], or injection of autologous induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)‐derived islets [10] are under investigation with promising results. A long‐lasting T1D patient transplanted with autologous iPSC‐derived islets was recently reported to maintain normoglycemia after 1 year of follow‐up [11]. To preserve β‐cell function and improve metabolic control, glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists, such as Liraglutide [12], have been applied as an adjunct therapy to insulin, resulting in decreased insulin requirement and better glucose control [13].",
        "Although these approaches have opened new avenues for treating T1D, none of them addresses the cause of the disease, that is, the immune‐mediated attack of β‐cells by autoreactive T cells. Therefore, approaches to restore tolerance to pancreatic antigens (Ags) remain an unmet medical need. In this context, several regulatory cell‐based approaches have been developed and tested in clinical trials.",
        "In this review, we will provide an overview of the latest advances in therapies based on the adoptive transfer of cells with immunoregulatory potential, including stem‐like cells, T lymphocytes, and antigen‐presenting cells (APCs) (Figure 1), designed to reverse autoimmunity in T1D. Such approaches could potentially complement β‐cell replacement and/or preservation strategies, halting the immune attack to the residual functional β‐cell in early phases of T1D or to the newly restored insulin‐producing cells in long‐term T1D patients.",
        "Schematic representation of proposed adoptive cell therapy strategies to restore tolerance in T1D. Strategies currently under investigation in clinical trials (upper panels) or in preclinical development (lower panels) based on the use of stem cells (left panel), Tregs (middle panel), or DCs (right panel). HSCs: Hematopoietic stem cells; MNCs: mononuclear cells; UCB‐SCs: umbilical cord blood‐derived stem cells; MSCs: mesenchymal stem cells; Tregs: regulatory T cells; CAR: chimeric antigen receptor; ASO: antisense oligonucleotides; HSP60: heat shock protein 60; VitD3: vitamin D3: Dexa: dexamethasone.",
        "Leveraging on the rationale of eliminating autoreactive immune cells prior to reconstruction of a naive self‐tolerant immune system and on the reported immunomodulatory activity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), autologous HSC transplantation has been applied to T1D patients, with a well‐preserved metabolic control in the short and mid‐term, and significant insulin independence [14, 15]. Less data is available for long‐term follow‐up, with variable percentages of relapse of autoimmunity [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Despite proven efficacy, the ratio of benefit to risk is still debated, given the potential for life‐threatening complications and the need to identify the patients’ subgroup that may benefit the most from this approach [14].",
        "To limit the risk of disease relapse after autologous HSC transplantation, the use of HSCs engineered to express the co‐inhibitory molecule programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) is currently under investigation (https://altheiascience.com). This novel approach may potentially impact autoreactive T cells exploiting the inhibitory PD1‐PD‐L1 axis, thus avoiding the risk of disease relapse after autologous HSC transplantation in T1D [21].",
        "Alternative stem‐cell‐based approaches have been explored to avoid the risks associated with HSC transplantation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are fibroblast‐like, multipotent stromal cells that can be isolated from multiple tissues. MSCs can remodel the immune response and inhibit effector T‐cell function by releasing soluble factors or via cell‐to‐cell contact mechanisms [22]. Direct injection of MSCs has been applied to treat graft‐versus‐host disease after allogeneic HSC transplantation, showing signs of immune modulation [23, 24]. This led to their exploration of solid organ transplantation [25], in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, with many studies showing clinical benefits, although the effects were temporary [26]. In the context of T1D, MSCs can potentially both support β‐cell regeneration and exert an immunomodulatory effect [27, 28]. Direct in vivo administration of umbilical cord blood (UCB)‐ or bone marrow‐derived MSCs has been tested at different stages of T1D (recent‐onset or long‐lasting disease) (Table 1). Thus far, the few data publicly available indicate positive safety profiles and potential therapeutic effects in preserving β‐cell function [29, 30, 31]. However, more extensive and longer‐term trials are necessary to confirm these results and evaluate the sustained benefits of MSC administration. The application of immunomodulatory MSCs is moving toward their ex vivo usage to re‐educate mononuclear cells upon exposure to adherent UCB‐derived MSCs. This approach, known as stem cell educator (SCE) therapy [32], was tested in several clinical trials enrolling T1D patients, both children and adults, at different stages of the disease (Table 1). The overall outcome proved the safety of SCE therapy and its ability to re‐shape the peripheral T cell compartment, with increased Tregs and CD4+ naïve T cells and the restoration of cytokine balance [33, 34]. SCE‐treated T1D patients showed mild improvement in metabolic control in the short term [33]. At the same time, signs of β‐cell preservation were detectable only in those patients with residual β‐cell function at the time of treatment [34]. An alternative approach exploits the well‐known paracrine activity of MSCs, consisting of extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes [35], which can be collected and injected into recipients [36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. This approach, previously tested in several inflammatory disorders [36, 37, 38, 39] with potential clinical benefit, is currently under investigation in a clinical trial for T1D (NCT02138331) (Table 1).",

In T1D, defects in the stability, function, and number of Tregs, or resistance of effector cells to inhibition, have been reported [43, 44, 45, 46].",

The results proved the approach to be safe. Still, the treatment showed signs of efficacy only in the pediatric cohorts, with preserved β‐cell functions at one‐year follow‐up and better metabolic outcomes in children with short disease duration [47, 48]. However, the disease progressed, and all patients became insulin‐dependent after 2 years [50]. Ex vivo expanded Treg‐based therapy has been recently applied in larger cohorts of children with new‐onset T1D in the Trex study (NCT02691247, Table 2) [51]. Regardless of dose, Treg infusions did not preserve residual β‐cell function. Interestingly, cell products with lower in vitro proliferation rates were associated with a reduced decline in C‐peptide, suggesting that Treg properties inversely correlating with proliferation promote efficacy [51].",

        "As an alternative source of Tregs, UCB has also been tested in two trials (NCT02932826; NCT03011021) (Table 2), with preliminary data suggesting that shorter disease duration is associated with better response to Treg therapy [52].",
        "The detection of the infused Tregs demonstrated that they rapidly declined after infusion, possibly due to the inadequate availability of IL‐2 in vivo [49]. To overcome this limitation, the combination of Treg‐therapy with a low dose of IL‐2 has been tested (NCT02772679, TILT trial) (Table 2), showing long‐term maintenance of Tregs in peripheral blood as compared with the Treg‐T1D trial. However, IL‐2 infusions did not expand injected Tregs but impacted non‐Tregs and did not preserve insulin production [53]. More recently, to overcome the inadequate availability of IL‐2 in vivo [53], Treg products, including chimeric IL‐2 constructs, have been developed. In the TiilT project (https://www.tiilt‐il2.eu/), 3rd‐generation IL‐2 fusion constructs targeting inflammatory sites have been developed to dampen local inflammation and promote IL‐2 stimulation of infused Tregs. This construct consists of an IL‐2 molecule (either native or mutein) fused to antibodies against oxidation‐specific epitopes (OSE, markers of inflammation) and a fragment of C4 binding protein beta (C4BPβ), as dimerization domain. The resulting construct shows improved cytokine half‐life, binds IL‐2 receptors and OSE, and expands Tregs in vivo. Moreover, the binding to OSE controls inflammation in vivo (https://www.tiilt‐il2.eu).",
        "To improve Treg efficacy, the elimination of APCs presenting autoAgs has been applied. To this end, autologous expanded Treg therapy has been combined with a B‐cell‐depleting agent (Rituximab). Delayed loss of insulin independence was reported (ISRCTN37116985), with a fraction of patients remaining insulin‐independent for up to 2 years [54, 55]. A subset of patients was described in clinical remission (i.e., with low need for external insulin while retaining proper metabolic control) 12 years after treatment (https://poltreg.com, unpublished) (Table 2). The first trial targeting presymptomatic T1D with Treg therapy and Rituximab is currently ongoing (NCT06688331). Results will likely clarify the impact of disease duration on the success of Treg‐based approaches.",
        "Overall, the current results point to a lack of long‐term efficacy of the infused Tregs, thus posing renewed challenges to the field. To improve Treg therapy, strategies to empower Tregs are under investigation, including engineering with transgenic T cell receptors (TCRs). Indeed, several TCRs have already been isolated from islet‐infiltrating pathogenic T cells [56]. In this frame, combining a machine learning approach, in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies, and clinical‐grade processes the ARTiDe consortium aims to develop novel TCR‐engineered Tregs to be tested in a phase I clinical trial for patients with T1D (https://artide.eu). At the same time, Abata Therapeutics has developed HLA‐DR4 restricted proinsulin‐targeted TCR‐engineered Tregs that fine‐tune the autoimmune response in vitro, directly and via infectious tolerance mechanisms. The ABA‐201 product is expected for the first‐in‐men clinical testing in 2025 (https://abatatx.com/our‐programs/) [57]. As an alternative, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology can redirect Tregs to pancreatic Ags in preclinical models of T1D [58]. Insulin‐directed CAR‐Tregs were generated from conventional T cells transduced with CAR constructs, including a Foxp3 cassette, resulting in Treg‐like cells that failed to prevent disease in NOD mice [59]. These findings suggest that soluble insulin could not be an appropriate target for CAR‐Tregs. Indeed, CAR engineered to recognize the insulin B chain 10–23 peptide presented in the context of the NOD mice I‐Ag7 MHC‐II allele prevented diabetes in T1D models [60]. Therefore, CAR‐Tregs targeting T1D‐associated peptide‐MHC complexes represent a valuable approach that deserves further investigation. Conversely, the use of CAR‐expressing ScFv specific for the human pancreatic endocrine marker (HPi2) was less promising. Despite demonstrated specificity for the selected Ag, HPi2‐CAR‐Tregs failed to expand due to the unexpected expression of CAR target on Tregs, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting targets for implementing CAR‐based strategies [61].",

        "Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional APCs directing adaptive immune responses. Tolerogenic DC (TolDCs) are specific subsets of DCs characterized by low expression of co‐stimulatory molecules, the production of anti‐inflammatory cytokines, and the ability to modulate effector T‐cell responses, induce T‐cell anergy, or Tregs. TolDCs can be generated in vitro from circulating monocytes, making them suitable as tools for inverse vaccination strategies [62].",
        "T1D was the first autoimmune disease treated with adoptive tolDC‐based therapy almost 20 years ago. In this study, DCs kept immature by treatment with antisense oligonucleotides targeting CD40‐CD80‐CD86 (NCT00445913) were administered to patients with fully established T1D (Table 3). The treatment was well tolerated, but no beneficial effects on glycemia control were reported [63].

        "TolDCs can also be obtained by treating monocytes during DC differentiation with vitamin D3 (VitD3) and Dexamethasone (Dexa), prior to pulsing with autologous Ag (VitD3/Dexa TolDC). This approach, previously tested to treat rheumatoid arthritis patients (AutoDECRA, NCT01352858) [64], was also applied to dampen pre‐existing islet Ag‐specific T‐cell responses with VitD3/Dexa TolDCs pulsed with the HLA‐DR4 restricted proinsulin‐derived peptide C19‐A3 (Eudract 2013‐005476‐18) (Table 3). Results confirmed a safe profile, but there was no evidence of improved glycemia control, likely due to the participants' low residual β‐cell function [65]. Nonetheless, this treatment induced a decline in pre‐existing C19‐A3‐specific T‐cell response, with the emergence of C19‐A3‐specific IL‐10‐producing cells up to 3 years after therapy [66]. Similar peptide‐pulsed TolDCs are under testing in recent‐onset (1–4 years from diagnosis) adult T1D patients (PipepTolDC, NCT04590872).",
        "Another ongoing trial foresees the subcutaneous administration of DCs tolerized with VitD3, co‐cultured with MSCs, and primed peptides (MSC‐tolDCs) to adult T1D patients (NCT05207995) (Table 3). The results of these ongoing trials are still unpublished.",
        "Potential signals of efficacy of tolDC therapy in preserving β‐cell function in T1D were recently reported in recent onset T1D patients treated with AVT001, consisting of fixed monocyte‐derived autologous DC loaded with a HLA‐E restricted peptide derived from heat shock protein 60 (NCT03895996) [67], previously reported to interact with a subset of CD8+ Tregs, described as defective in most T1D subjects [67, 68] (Table 3). AVT‐0001‐treated patients displayed less decline from baseline C‐peptide levels at 1 year, although the treatment had no impact on overall glycemia control or insulin requirements [67]. Thus, tolDC approaches specifically targeting Tregs have given the most promising results.",
        "Our group has developed a protocol to differentiate monocyte‐derived tolDCs in the presence of IL‐10 (DC‐10) [69, 70, 71] or by transduction of DC precursors with a lentiviral vector (LV) encoding for IL‐10 (DCIL‐10) [72, 73]. Given their ability to induce Ag‐specific Tr1 cells through the IL‐10‐dependent ILT4/HLA‐G pathway [69, 74], these tolDCs have a huge potential for application in the context of autoimmune diseases. To pursue the dream of restoring tolerance in T1D by boosting islet Ag‐specific Tregs, we recently implemented an LV platform encoding for both IL‐10 and Ag‐derived epitopes to generate a tolDC product (DCIL‐10/Ag) able to dampen detrimental pathogenic T cells and foster the induction of Ag‐specific Tregs. We demonstrated that DCIL‐10/Ag modulates T‐cell responses and promotes Tr1 cells in vitro and in vivo. Repeated administration of DCIL‐10/Ag encoding for islet‐derived epitopes in preclinical models of T1D prevents disease onset and induces islet‐specific Tr1 cells. Furthermore, DCIL‐10/Ag encoding for an α‐gliadin‐derived epitope induced the conversion of pathogenic gliadin‐specific T cells from celiac disease patients into Tr1 cells [75]. We are currently expanding our studies to select the best islet‐derived Ags for the application of DCIL‐10/Ag in T1D (unpublished data).",
        "Despite the numerous clinical trials reported, reversing autoimmunity in T1D remains challenging. The adoptive transfer of immunomodulatory cells has given important indications for tracing the roadmap toward next‐generation cell therapies. First, the treatment should be administered in the early stages of the disease, ideally even in the presymptomatic phase. To this end, better biomarkers to identify first‐degree relatives of T1D patients at high risk of developing T1D, besides the presence of anti‐islet antibodies, are warranted. Second, strategies relying on FOXP3‐dependent Tregs as tolerizing agents resulted in mild therapeutic effects, likely due to their reduced in vivo fitness. Last, in vivo induction of Ag‐specific Tregs other than the FOXP3‐expressing subset, as in the case of adoptive tolDC‐based therapies [66, 67] or the reported MHC‐Ag‐coated nanoparticles [76], may result in a more durable and self‐sustaining effect.",

        "Although type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented or reversed, islet transplantation—which restores insulin independence and prevents severe hypoglycemia—is currently proving to be a promising treatment (1, 2). However, the results of multiple clinical trials have shown that most transplant recipients fail to achieve complete insulin independence. Although the immunosuppressive regimen reported from Edmonton, Canada, has achieved unprecedented success in achieving insulin independence in islet transplantation (3), there are still some problems that affect the outcome of islet transplantation. Advancements in the acquisition of pancreatic islets, immunosuppression of islet recipients, and an increase in the number of transplanted islets are required (4). The average human pancreas has 300,000 to 1.5 million pancreatic islets, and only 60% of this islet cell mass is needed to maintain a normal glucose metabolism (5). However, 72% of islet recipients still require more than two successfully processed islet preparations to obtain a sufficient beta cell mass to compensate for islet death in the post-transplantation period (6). However, the source of pancreatic islets is limited.",
        "It was observed that only 10% of recipients remain insulin dependent for more than 5 years and that most recipients re-use insulin because of a decline in the islet function over time (7). During transplantation, islet grafts are damaged by multiple challenges, including enzyme and mechanical damage caused by the isolation process, hypoxia, inflammation, immune rejection and toxicity of immunosuppressive drugs (8). The liver is currently the preferred transplantation site because the procedure is minimally invasive, easy to perform, and has low rates of bleeding and thrombosis (9). Early inflammatory responses strongly influence islet engraftment and survival after intrahepatic transplantation. This early immune response is triggered by immediate blood-mediated inflammatory response (IBMIR) and ischemia-reperfusion injury (10). Elevated inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), were observed during islet transplantation, and macrophages also involved in regulating the cell injury of transplanted pancreatic islets (11). It was observed that concomitant transplantation of islets and vascular endothelial cells in diabetic rats can prolong the survival of islet grafts (12). Previous studies have found that cytokine inhibitors or drugs that inhibit the activation of liver macrophage activation can improve the function of pancreatic islets after transplantation (13, 14). Changes in the microenvironment, mainly involving inflammatory cytokines, endothelial cells, and immune cells, play a key role in the survival of islet grafts.",
        "This review discusses the changes in the microenvironment (inflammatory cytokines, immune cells, endothelial cells, etc.) during clinical intraportal islet transplantation, and their influence on the survival of the islet grafts, with the aim of improving the success of clinical islet transplantation",
        "In 1990, David Scharp et al. reported the first case of type 1 diabetes allogeneic intraportal islet transplantation resulting in a short-term insulin independence, which opened the prelude to clinical islet transplantation (15). The International Islet Registry collected data from 267 islet allogeneic transplants from multiple centers between 1990 and 2001, only 12.4% of cases achieved insulin independence periods of at least 1 week, and 8.2% maintained insulin independence for more than 1 year. Appropriate immunosuppression remained a critical piece of the unsolved puzzle in order to improve long-term graft function and sustained insulin independence (16). Until 2000, Edmonton’s group reported that insulin independence was achieved in seven patients with type 1 diabetes who underwent islet transplantation. This protocol established the need for sufficient islet β cell mass for transplantation and also proposed a glucocorticoid-free immunosuppressive regimen (3). Since the publication of the Edmonton protocol, many countries around the world have successively carried out allogeneic islet transplantation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Extended follow-up of these trials sho wed a gradual loss of insulin independence over time with renewed need for exogenous insulin, with only 10% of patients showing insulin independence at 5 years after transplantation (7). Hering et al. reported in 2016 that the North American Clinical Islet Transplant Consortium conducted a multicenter, single-arm, phase 3 trial to further evaluate the efficiency of allogeneic islet transplantation. The assay, using product purified human pancreatic islets, achieved an HbA1c of 5.6% in the absence of severe hypoglycemia (17). A subsequent multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial in Europe reconfirmed the benefit of islet transplantation over intensive insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes with severe hypoglycemia or after kidney transplantation (18). Recently, Marco et al. proposed that vitamin D alone or in combination with other anti-inflammatory agents may serve as a new immunomodulatory strategy to reduce the recurrence of autoimmune/allogeneic transplant rejection in intraportal islet transplantation, but its safety and efficacy further validation in large prospective studies is required (19). In intraportal islet transplantation model, islet pretreatment with mitomycin C prolonged graft survival by suppressing pro-inflammatory events and inducing latent regulatory lymphocytes (20). Xenogeneic and stem cell-derived islet tissues have entered early clinical trials, although much remains to be learned about the in vivo physiology and immunogenicity of various products. These advances provide more options for cellular therapy in diabetes treatment, providing an unlimited source of pancreatic islet tissue for future applications (21).",
        "Instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR)",
        "The IBMIR, which is triggered by exposed tissue factor on the islet surface and characterized by platelet activation and aggregation, and activation of the coagulation and complement systems, is a major obstacle after islet transplantation. Moreover, it increases the infiltration of neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages (13). These reactions are thought to cause the immediate loss of most of the transplanted islets (22), and may also increase the risk of islet rejection later through adaptive immune responses (23). Potential means for reducing islet inflammation and protecting islets can be achieved by the addition of anti-inflammatory agents, anticoagulants or coating islets with various protective macromolecules during islet culture (24). In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that low molecular weight dextran sulfate prevented IBMIR, leukocyte infiltration was eliminated at high doses, and transplanted pig islets survived significantly longer in recipients treated with low molecular weight dextran sulfate (25). Another phase II, multicenter, active-controlled, randomized study, the Clinical Islet Transplant Consortium 01 study, revealed that systemic low molecular weight dextran sulfate treatment showed similar efficacy to heparin treatment in preventing IBMIR and promoting islet engraftment (26). However, the reason for the current reluctance to use it is that its target- activated partial thromboplastin time is 3 times longer than heparin’s (27). The use of biotin/avidin technology to bind preformed heparin complexes to the islet surface resulted in protection against IBMIR in vitro loop model and in an allogeneic porcine model of clinical islet transplantation (28). In vitro and in vivo data suggested that activated protein C exerted anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities by directly acting on cells after exposure of hepatic endothelial cells to pancreatic islets (29). However, the above remain to be verified by clinical studies (30, 31). And it has been confirmed that Cibinetide can reduce IBMIR related platelet consumption in a pro-inflammatory environment and protect isolated human islets (32). The evidence showed that α-1 antitrypsin inhibited IBMIR, which resulted in improved outcome of intraportal islet transplantation in mouse model (33). Currently, the addition of heparin is the standard approach but it is insufficient (27).",
        "Complement activation is triggered by natural immunoglobulin (Ig)G or IgM. When isolated islets are exposed to blood, the complement system is rapidly activated and causes lysis of islet cells (34). Complement activation occurs via the classical pathway and an alternative pathway, which leads to the formation of a complex composed of C5b-9, which forms a “channel” through the cell membrane, leading to cell lysis and death. Another major function of the complement system is the production of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, which enhance the inflammatory response to islets (23). C3a and C5a produced by complement activation are powerful chemoattractants for macrophages and neutrophils (10). Activation through the C5a receptor can cause granulocytes to release enzymes, such as myeloperoxidase and elastase, and promote monocytes to release cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a. C5a stimulates endothelial cells to release heparin sulfate, upregulate tissue factor, secrete von Willebrand factor and express P-selectin, which is conducive to fibrin deposition and which enhances thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesion (23). Tissue factor and many adhesion molecules can be expressed by endothelial cells triggered by soluble C5b-9 (sC5b-9) (35). Complement activation may therefore induce direct inflammation and indirect effects mediated by endothelial cells.",
        "In allogeneic transplantation, C3 is one of the important factors triggering rejection in mice (36, 37) and humans (38). Numerous studies have shown that the combination of C3 fragment C3dg with an antigen can be used as a strong adjuvant to promote both cellular and humoral responses (39). Therefore, it can be reasonably expected that complement activation and C3dg binding will trigger an immune response, leading to an adaptive immune response to the graft (34). Therefore, small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting C3 and C5a receptors may increase the viability of transplanted islets (40).",
        "Islets are easily damaged under hypoxic conditions prior to transplantation (including pancreas procurement, islet isolation and culture) and exposure to hypoxic environment of the transplant site after transplantation (41). Hypoxia damages islet β cell function, which manifested anaerobic glycolysis, showed elevated lactate and reduced responsiveness to high glucose levels (42). The decrease of blood oxygen partial pressure can lead to irreversible β cell dysfunction, resulting in higher fasting blood-glucose and lower C-peptide levels (43). Calcium influx into islet cells has also been shown to cause cell damage in rat and human islets cultured under hypoxic conditions (44). In order to cope with the impact of hypoxia on the quality and function of islets, the following explorations were attempted: (1) Compared with static cold storage, perfusion effectively reduced anoxic death of islet cells, and islet production was higher after perfusion (45, 46). Perfluorohexyloctan, a semi-fluorinated liquid fluorocarbon, maintained higher intrapancreatic pO2 and improved islet viability and function with porcine pancreas (47, 48). In addition, oxygen supply can be increased and oxygenation of islets can be improved by decreasing the culture density of islets before transplantation (46, 49). (2) Photosynthesis of thermostable microalga (Chlorella sorokiniana) was applied as a method to supply oxygen to cultured islets coencapsulating in alginate gel (50). Microparticle-mediated-oxygenation has been studied to improve islet transplantation.Co-transplantation of oxygen-generating microparticles and minimal islet mass within fibrin-conjugated heparin/VEGF collagen scaffold has enormous potential to enhance islet revascularization, diabetes reversal and oxygenation (51). (3) As mentioned above, the influx of calcium ions into islet cells can also induce islet injury. It was found that potassium channel activator (diazoxide) and calcium channel blocker (nifedipine) were helpful to restore the synthesis of insulin protoplasts and islet cell necrosis caused by hypoxia when used as preconditioning agents (44, 52). (4) Curcumin has the ability to protect β cells from hypoxia damage (53). Puerarin could alleviate β cell apoptosis and malfunction by hypoxic injury of β cells in corpulent mice induced by cobalt chloride induced via PI3K/Akt pathway activation (54). (5) Reconstructing the capillary network in islets is very important to prevent hypoxia and preserve function. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of prevascularization of the graft bed for subcutaneous islet graft survival (55–58). The use of islet-cell cluster in clinical islet transplantation may be a strategy to prevent islet loss caused by hypoxia after transplantation (59).",
        "During intraportal islet transplantation, isolated islets are exposed to high levels of immunosuppressive drugs, which are detrimental to islet engraftment/survival and long-term function (60). Previously, the standard protocol of immunosuppression for islet transplantation included a combination of corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine), and purine analogs (mycophenolate mofetil). Many of the above drugs had been shown to be diabetogenic, impairing insulin secretion (61). The Edmonton protocol in 1999 took a major step forward in islet transplantation with the introduction of steroid-free therapy based on low-dose sirolimus, tacrolimus, and daclizumab (3). Although the results of multicenter clinical trials suggested that this protocol could provide short-term insulin independence and reduce the incidence of acute rejection (62), patients receiving long-term immunosuppressive drugs are susceptible to multiple adverse effects, such as infections (63), malignancies (64), de novo diabetes (65) and organ toxicities (66).",
        "Immune tolerance induction is a promising strategy to accept histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched allografts without reducing resistance to infection or increasing other complications (67). For immunological tolerance to allografts, the high proportion of MHC alloreactive T cell is considered as a major barrier to tolerance induction. Central T cell tolerance refers to the deletion of reactive clones in the thymus during negative selection. Peripheral T cell tolerance includes peripheral deletion, anergy/exhaustion, and suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Treg) (68). At present, how to apply the inherent immune tolerance mechanism of the human system to induce donor-specific immune tolerance is the key to solving transplant rejection (69). Singh et al. reported that apoptotic donor lymphocyte infusion prior to transplantation induced long-term tolerance (>1 year) of islet grafts in a non-human primate (NHP) model, which had made a breakthrough in the tolerance induction protocol for allogeneic islet transplantation (70).",
        "Intrathymic inoculation of recipient APCs pulsed with allopeptides can induce intrathymic tolerance, however it is an invasive technique and the thymus regresses with age and has limited potential in adults (71). Another potentially more effective approach to achieving central tolerance is the generation of hematopoietic chimerism or mixed allogeneic chimerism, with lethal total body irradiation or sublethal total body irradiation (assisted by anti-CD4, CD8 monoclonal antibodies or costimulatory blockade) in the prospective transplant recipients, in order to make room for the transplanted bone marrow. Bone marrow cell transplantation can reconstitute the recipient’s hematopoietic compartment with donor hematopoietic stem cells, inducing donor-specific tolerance to islet allografts (62, 72). Another strategy to induce tolerance is to deplete alloreactive T cells prior to transplantation, promoting a hyporesponsive environment that drives tolerance transition (73). T cell depletion can be achieved by total body irradiation, lymphocyte depleting alloantibodies. Among them, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is a potent inducer of T cell depletion, and ATG alone or in combination with other drugs can prolong the survival of allografts (74, 75). Other pathways for inducing immune tolerance include costimulatory signal blockades, induction and expansion of regulatory T (Treg) cells, etc (62). And in the intrahepatic mouse allogeneic islet transplantation model, Lee et al. demonstrated for the first time that short-term single administration of anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody could induce FoxP3+ Treg cell-mediated immune tolerance (67).",
        "Several mediators have been found to cause islet dysfunction and/or cellular death after islet transplantation, including inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ), nitric oxide (NO), and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (76).",
        "IL-1β is one of the most important mediators of islet injury and plays an important role in the process of pancreatic islets dysfunction, which may represent an early inflammatory marker of graft failure (77). IL-1β is secreted by Kupffer cells, islet resident macrophages, and neutrophils around the transplantation site (78). IL-1β secretion increases during islet acquisition, islet isolation, islet culture, and islet transplantation (77). IL-1β binds to the IL-1β receptor (IL-1βR) on the surface of pancreatic islet cells, causing TNF receptor-related factor 6 (TRAF6) to be activated by IL-1 receptor-related kinase (IRAK), which in turn leads to the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. Then NF-κB is released from inhibitory IκB, transferred from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and regulates the transcription of various genes, including IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and iNOS (76, 79) (\nFigure 1\n). Activation of iNOS results in the production of NO, which is directly related to β-cell apoptosis (80).",
        "Schematic diagram demonstrating the intracellular cascade of events that occur in the pancreatic islet after stimulation by IL-1β, IFN-γ and TNF-α. IL-1β binds to the IL-1β receptor (IL-1βR), causing TNF receptor-related factor 6 (TRAF6) to be activated by IL-1 receptor-related kinase (IRAK), then NF-κB is released from inhibitory IκB, transferred from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and regulates the transcription of various genes, including IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and iNOS; TNF-α binding to the TNF receptor (TNF-R), initiates the activation of NF-κB and the induction of apoptosis; IFN-γ binds to the IFN-γ receptor (IFN-γR) and causes the activation of JAK1 and JAK2. JAK2 then activates signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1), which then transfers to the nucleus, where it performs gene regulation.",
        "The damage of islet cells starts from the donor. Although most pancreatic islet transplants use organs from heart-beating brain-dead (BD) donors, acute physiological changes after brain death of BD donors may still cause significant damage to islets from inflammatory events. Brain death can stimulate various cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, and produce a so-called “cytokine storm”, including IL-1β in BD donors, which greatly reduces the islet yield, functionality, vitality, and engraftment after transplantation (8). One study has shown that the administration of exendin-4 to BD donors can reduce the expression of IL-1β, thereby increasing both the islet viability and insulin secretion in the pancreas after glucose stimulation in a BD rat model (81). In the BD rat model, treatment with a selective neutrophil elastase inhibitor, sivelestat sodium, decreased the expression of IL-1β, significantly improved the islet yield and function in vitro, and suppressed hypercytokinemia-mediated beta-cell death (82).",
        "Then, in the process pancreas digestion and islet purification, enzymatic and mechanical stress can induce inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1β, in the islets (77). The islet basement membrane is lysed during the digestion and separation of the pancreas, which interrupts the communication between islet basement membrane proteins and the integrins expressed by the islets (83). The loss of the interaction between the internal cells and the external microenvironment also interrupts the transmission of pro-survival signals (84). The isolation of pancreatic islets eventually leads to the increased expression of many stress kinases, which subsequently activates pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic pathways (43, 85). Furthermore, the functional clustering of differentially expressed genes revealed the upregulation of genes related to cell growth, angiogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis after isolation and culture (43). A study has shown that islets in early culture (2 days) express more genes, including IL-1β, than islets in long-term culture (7-11 days). It seems that culturing islets before transplantation is beneficial for reducing the expression of inflammatory mediators (86). However, in cultured adult porcine islets, IL-1β mRNA was continuously detected at 1, 4, 8, and 11 days after isolation, and slightly increased over time (87). It is worth noting that a pretreatment culture with anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist) prior to human islet transplantation can improve the survival and function of human islets during culture (88).",
        "The early damage of pancreatic islets is mainly manifested by an IBMIR, leading to a cytokine storm, involving IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. These cytokine-activated macrophages produce IL-1β, which triggers the cytokine storm at the transplantation site, leading to a negative chain of events (89). Syngeneic transplant models have shown that the nonspecific inflammatory response increases IL-1β at the transplant site and affects early graft failure. In that study, the expression of IL-1β mRNA was maximal on day 1 after transplantation and then declined towards pre-transplantation levels on day 7 (90). Previous animal studies have indicated that approximately 60% of islet grafts lose their function via non-specific inflammation within 3 days after transplantation (91, 92). The overexpression of IL-1β receptor antagonist protein in transplanted islets can improve the outcome of the transplantation (93).",
        "In humans, it appears that IL-1β must act in combination with IFN-γ and/or TNF-α (76). After TNF-α binds to the TNF receptor (TNF-R), it forms a trimer and undergoes conformational changes, which leads to the exposure of the intracellular death domain, and initiates the activation of NF-κB, the activation of the MAPK pathway, and the induction of apoptosis (40). Wen et al. revealed that TNF-α was significantly elevated in patients following allogeneic islet cell infusion compared with patients receiving autologous transplantation (94). Recently, multiple studies have shown that after pancreatic islet allotransplantation, the early use of a combination of anti-IL-1β (anakinra) and TNF-α (etanercept) inflammation blockade is beneficial for reducing islet damage caused by nonspecific inflammation and presumably led to better engraftment (95) (\nFigure 1\n).",
        "IFN-γ binds to the IFN-γ receptor (IFN-γR) and causes the activation of JAK1 and JAK2. JAK2 then activates signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1), which then transfers to the nucleus, where it performs gene regulation (96). One study showed that IFN-γ transcripts were found in allografts at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after transplantation, and peaked on day 5, but there were no such cytokines in syngeneic grafts (97). Some studies have shown that combined cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ lead to islet cell dysfunction or death (98).",
        "Cytokines, such as IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ, mainly stimulate the large expression of iNOS in β cells and macrophages to synthesize excessive NO, thereby causing damage to the pancreatic islets (99); the latter can form a highly active free radical peroxynitrite (ONOO-) by losing an electron and combining with superoxide free radicals, which have strong cytotoxicity and promote apoptosis (100, 101) (\nFigure 1\n). NO affects many physiological β-cell processes, including inhibition of oxidative metabolism, changes in the expression of target genes, inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, damage to DNA, and induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. If exposure to NO is prolonged, it activates various signal cascades and eventually leads to the death of β cells (102). In xenogeneic islet transplantation animal models, selective iNOS inhibitors can suppress the production of induced NO, to prevent early islet graft failure (103).",
        "Macrophages, which are one of the cellular components of the innate immune system, show great heterogeneity in physiological and pathological conditions. They can be polarized into pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) or anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) in different environments (104). Lipopolysaccharide and interferon IFN-γ can activate M1 macrophages to secrete TNF-α, iNOS and superoxide anion to play pro-inflammatory and host defense functions. In contrast, M2 macrophages have a protective role in the immune response and inflammation. Other studies showed that M2 macrophages can be activated by interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, and play an immune regulatory and anti-inflammatory role, through the secretion of IL-1Rα, IL-1,TNF-α, IL-10, and other cytokines (104, 105).",
        "After the islets are infused into the portal vein, the activated liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) play a central role in the inflammatory responses within the liver, secreting a series of factors (including arachidonic acid metabolites, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-6, complement, coagulation factors, reactive oxygen species and nitrogen) to recognize and respond to various signals from the surrounding microenvironment, directly affecting the survival of intrahepatic islets (11, 106, 107). Furthermore, Kupffer cells can induce a response of other non-immune cell subsets, including endothelial cells (108). In addition, it has been suggested that ischemia reperfusion phenomena may directly trigger the activation of sinusoidal endothelial cells and help trigger nonspecific inflammatory responses (109). The transplanted islets, residual endotoxin produced in the process of islet isolation, and liver sinusoidal endothelial damage can all activate Kupffer cells (11, 110). In addition, tissue damage can recruit inflammatory macrophages (M1), which in turn cause islet damage (111). At the same time, dying β cells also produce high mobility group box 1 (HGMB) and iNOS, attracting more macrophages to the liver, and enhancing inflammation and β cell death (14, 112) (\nFigure 2\n).",
        "Interaction between various types of cells after islet transplantation. Macrophages secreting TNF-α and iNOS, which act on beta-cells and endothelial cells to play a pro-inflammatory function; Kupffer cells secreting a series of substances (including IL-1β, IFN-γ and TNF-α), directly affecting the survival of intrahepatic islets and endothelial cells; Antigen presenting cells (APCs) take and process antigens from donor and present antigens to host T cells, then reactive CD8+, CD4+ T-cells destroy transplanted islet β cells.",
        "Macrophage depletion can significantly reduce the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α, indicating the role of macrophages in the production of inflammatory cytokines (11). Gou et al. demonstrated that Alpha-1 antitrypsin can protect the survival of islet grafts, in part by inhibiting the polarization of M1 macrophages both in vivo and in vitro (14). One study has mentioned that the local sustained-release of dexamethasone in grafts promotes the survival of mouse pancreatic islet grafts by inducing the differentiation of M2 macrophages in the graft microenvironment as well as the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors (104). Chappell et al. showed that activated M2 macrophages could improve the survival conditions of grafts in a mouse model by improving revascularization or neovascularization, which had a repair function in the graft reaction (113).",
        "Type I diabetes is characterized by the autoimmune-mediated damage of islet β-cells, and the transplanted islets will also be attacked by the same stresses that destroy host β-cells (40). CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells are the major players in the destruction of β cells. Activated T cells produce cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and lymphotoxin to induce β cell apoptosis. T cells also express ligands for the Fas receptor and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligands, both of which lead to apoptosis by activating effector caspases. In addition, CD8+ T cells directly contact and promote the release of granzyme B into the cytoplasm of target cells through perforin, thereby activating nucleases and caspases to kill the target cells (40, 98). In some studies, CD8+ T cell infiltration was observed in the pancreas of type 1 diabetic patients and the transplanted pancreas (114, 115). In mouse models, deficiency of CD4+ T cells was observed to stop progression to insulitis (116).",
        "During the rejection of allogeneic transplantation, the host immune response can directly or indirectly be activated by T cells recognizing the donor tissue. Direct graft recognition involves an interaction between the donor tissue resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and host T cells via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (117). Indirect recognition involves the treatment of donor graft peptides by host APCs and corresponding MHC interactions to stimulate host T cells (118). APCs, including macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), passenger leukocytes, from both donors and host are involved in the antigen presentation (40). The activation and maturation of T cells depends on the signals from the above APCs. If these signals are blocked, T cells will undergo apoptosis (\nFigure 2\n).",
        "DCs can not only initiate an immune response, but also induce central or peripheral immune tolerance (40). Mature or activated DCs can initiate a positive immune response, while immature DCs or DC precursors show tolerance.  is a transcription factor that is necessary for DC differentiation and maturation. The inhibition of the  pathway has been shown to produce tolerogenic DCs (119). RelB is a major  protein, which inhibits the expression of MHC-II, CD80, and CD86, and ultimately prevents the maturation of dendritic cells. RelB silenced DCs can inhibit antigen-specific alloreactive immune rejection and reduce the proliferation of antigen-specific T cells (120). In another study, tolerogenic DCs were generated by inhibiting the expression of CD80 or CD86. The administration of modified dendritic cells (DC) can prolong the survival of allografts, thereby inducing T cell hyporesponsiveness and apoptosis (121).",
        "The poor outcome of intraportal islet transplantation can be explained by IBMIR, one of which is characterized by leucocyte infiltration. The islets were mixed with ABO-compatible blood in a heparinized tube, and the first neutrophilic granulocytes appeared in the islets after 15 minutes, increasing at 1 hour and peaking at 2 hours (122). Neutrophilic granulocytes induce cell damage through cytotoxic attack and phagocytosis. After neutrophil activation, superoxidase is produced to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release protease, both of which are involved in killing microbes (123). Neutrophilic granulocytes are also known to contain a large number of cytokines, which are released upon activation, and there is much evidence that cytokines have a damaging effect on pancreatic islets (124). And their infiltration results in the release of chemokines such as TNF-α and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α) from T cells and macrophages. The mobilization of this immune effector may have effects on specific immune systems, inducing and enhancing cellular rejection (122). The massive infiltration of neutrophilic granulocytes not only causes functional impairment or reduces the mass of the implanted islets, but may also amplify the subsequent immune response, causing direct damage to the islets (125). Therefore, the development of drugs targeting neutrophil toxicity may markedly improve the outcome of intraportal islet transplantation.",
        "Pancreatic islets have an extensive capillary network, which—in addition to providing nutrients and oxygen to the islet endocrine cells and transporting hormones to the peripheral circulation—is an important source of signals for improving the survival rate and function of islet β cells (126). While islets only constitute 1% of the weight of the pancreas, they receive approximately 15% of the blood flow of the pancreas (127). In the process of the isolation, the islets are disrupted from the surrounding tissue and the capillary networks. Therefore, revascularization of the islets after transplantation is important for the function and survival of the islet graft. The endothelial cells retained in the islets after islet isolation are lost after the islets are cultured for 7 days. The isolated islets are considered to be an avascular tissue, and revascularization is carried out through the blood vessels that grow from the host organ to the islets (128). Angiogenesis begins on the first day after transplantation, and vascular remodeling may continue for up to 3 months (129). In comparison to cultured islets, transplantation of freshly isolated islets containing numerous endothelial cells may significantly improve the vascularization of transplanted islets, which in turn leads to an enhanced endocrine function and the survival of islet grafts (130). Olsson et al. observed that islet grafts obtained from freshly isolated islets have higher vascular density and oxygen tension, as well as higher ability to cure chemically induced diabetes, in comparison to islet grafts obtained from cultured islets (131).",
        "Pancreatic islets and vascular endothelial cells secrete high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can recruit neovascularization (132). Cheng et al. used adenovirus containing cDNA from human VEGF isoforms to transfected islets and transplanted it into diabetic nude mice. It was found that the blood glucose was normal and that the revascularization of islets was improved (133). Johansson et al. demonstrated that the production of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in vitro by endothelial cells increased the proliferation of beta cells, which in turn required VEGF from beta cells (134). VEGF can also stimulate the release of interleukins and increase blood flow to ischemic tissues (135) (\nFigure 2\n). However, the supplementation of VEGF in islet grafts may have a negative impact, which recruits and amplifies inflammation, which may destroy islets (133). Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that resident liver macrophages and endothelial cells can mediate early islet dysfunction by secreting cytokines and activating inducible iNOS (103).",
        "Islet transplantation remains a promising treatment to improve the quality of life for many individuals with type 1 diabetes. If the restoration of normal glucose tolerance can be achieved, non-specific inflammation during transplantation can be reduced, and immune tolerance to islet tissue can be induced, it will be an ideal treatment for this disease. However, during the process of islet transplantation—including isolation, culture, and islet implantation—inflammation, ischemia, hypoxia, and immune responses will occur, resulting in the loss of the graft. The transplantation microenvironment plays an important role. Cytokine-mediated non-specific inflammation, immune cell-mediated rejection, and endothelial cells participate in post-transplant vascular remodeling, which directly and indirectly affect graft survival. Some cytokine inhibitors and siRNA targeting complement receptors have been shown to improve the viability of transplanted islets. Understanding the influence of the microenvironment on the survival of transplanted islets, as well as possible therapeutic targets is significant for the future of islet transplantation. The improvement of the microenvironment and the continuous progress of transplantation strategies will eventually improve the prognosis of transplant recipients.",

    "title": "The potential role of multifunctional human amniotic epithelial cells in pancreatic islet transplantation. 1 diabetes mellitus, chiefly in individuals who are refractory to conventional insulin replacement therapy. At present its clinical use is restricted, firstly by the limited access to suitable donor organs but also due to factors associated with the current clinical transplant procedure which inadvertently impair the long-term functionality of the islet graft. Of note, the physical, biochemical, inflammatory, and immunological stresses to which islets are subjected, either during pretransplant processing or following implantation are detrimental to their sustained viability, necessitating repeated islet infusions to attain adequate glucose control. Progressive decline in functional beta (beta)-cell mass leads to graft failure and the eventual re-instatement of exogenous insulin treatment. Strategies which protect and/or preserve optimal islet function in the peri-transplant period would improve clinical outcomes. Human amniotic epithelial cells (HAEC) exhibit both pluripotency and immune-privilege and are ideally suited for use in replacement and regenerative therapies. The HAEC secretome exhibits trophic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties of relevance to islet graft survival. Facilitated by beta-cell supportive 3D cell culture systems, HAEC may be integrated with islets bringing them into close spatial arrangement where they may exert paracrine influences that support beta-cell function, reduce hypoxia-induced islet injury, and alter islet alloreactivity. The present review details the potential of multifunctional HAEC in the context of islet transplantation, with a focus on the innate capabilities that may counter adverse events associated with the current clinical transplant protocol to achieve long-term islet graft function.

        "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious disease of the central nervous system with more than half a million new cases worldwide reported every year.[\n\n1\n, \n2\n\n] The main contributors to poor recovery from SCI are a nonpermissive microenvironment and insufficient replenishment of cells in the lesion.[\n\n3\n, \n4\n\n] To date, no safe and effective clinical therapy could strike a balance between inhibiting neuroinflammation and restoring neural circuits after SCI.[\n\n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n\n] Over the last decade, significant progress has been made toward elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing SCI pathology, as well as understanding the limitations of reparative strategies relying solely on biomaterials or stem cell transplantation.[\n\n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n\n] Hence, biomedical engineering shows potential for developing effective SCI treatments.[\n\n13\n\n] Nevertheless, addressing persistent challenges related to scaffolds design, seed cells, and translational applications remains an important goal (Figure \n1a).",
        "Strategy proposal of dual driving forces model and HES–hAESCs for SCI repair. a) Current challenges faced by stem cell‐involved therapeutics are listed from the perspectives of scaffold, seed cell and practical requirement in clinic. b) Sketch of the proposed strategy. Briefly, GelMA scaffolds with large specific surface area were manufactured to increase the upper limit of cell loading. Then, SAA postprocessing conferred HES with dual driving forces for self‐promoted cell‐absorbing in rehydration. After that, HES are easy for long‐term storage and transportation. HES rapidly absorbs 2.6 million cells in ≈2 min. HES–hAESCs is then used for SCI repair by the immunoregulation and neurotrophy of hAESCs. HES functions in a similar way to a vacuum cleaner by efficiently absorbing hAESCs driven by dual driving forces. Scaffolds volume: a 50–60 mm3 GelMA scaffold is designed and printed; After SAA postprocessing, the scaffold shrinks to ≈1 mm3 and can be packaged independently; After rehydration in cell suspension, the volume of HES–hAESCs returns back to ≈50 mm3. Abbreviations: SCI, spinal cord injury; TPMS, three‐period minimal surface; GelMA, gelatin‐methacryloyl; SAA, super absorption and attachment; HES, hyper expansion scaffold; hAESCs, human amniotic epithelial stem cells; HES–hAESCs, high hAESCs‐loaded HES.",
        "There is an urgent need to develop improved scaffold‐based cell delivery systems to solve the issues regarding insufficient cell loading and operational complexity within current approaches.[\n\n14\n, \n15\n\n] Due to the high flow resistance in the depths of scaffolds, surface utilization is poor with a nonhomogeneous distribution of cells. Cell‐laden bioprinting enables rapid production of customized implants containing highly dense and precisely arranged cells.[\n\n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n\n] But cells enclosed within bioinks face risks of compromised viability, activity and DNA stability from unavoidable mechanical stress and free radical during printing and molding, particularly for delicate cell types like stem cells and neuronal cells.[\n\n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n\n] Overcoming this challenge is critical to enable translational applications. Many cell‐friendly processes and parameters were established to minimize the cellular damage during fabrication,[\n\n24\n, \n25\n\n] however, it may require more improvements in techniques for practical use. Thus, separating cells from scaffold fabrication could be a proper strategy, improving the modularization and standardization for practical applications.[\n\n26\n\n]",
        "While induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their derived cells remain popular candidates in many preclinical studies dur to their versatility,[\n\n27\n\n] concerns regarding safety and ethics impede their clinical translation.[\n\n28\n, \n29\n\n] Given the neural cell loss and severe neuroinflammation after SCI, identifying candidate cells that can balance immunomodulation and neural properties is critical for repair. Our previous studies have demonstrated that human amniotic epithelial stem cells (hAESCs), which are perinatal stem cells from the amnion of the placenta, possess critical properties of guaranteed safety, hypoimmunogenicity and immunoregulation.[\n\n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n, \n34\n, \n35\n\n] Additionally, hAESCs secrete several anti‐inflammatory and neurotrophic factors, highlighting their potential for use in SCI treatment.[\n\n36\n, \n37\n, \n38\n, \n39\n\n]",
        "To address these issues, we proposed a dual driving forces model to explain the mechanism of efficient cell absorption. Based on this model, we developed a delivery tool with high cell loading via self‐promoted absorption, which we termed hyper expansion scaffold (HES). Considering the suitable properties of hAESCs for SCI treatment, we further established a novel therapeutic system named high‐hAESCs‐loaded HES (HES–hAESCs), and assessed its effects in SCI models (Figure 1b). Gelatin‐methacryloyl (GelMA) scaffolds with high specific surface area were dehydrated through a super‐absorption and adhesion (SAA) postprocessing. The dehydrated scaffolds facilitated highly efficient cell absorption via two synergistic driving forces: macroscopic swelling and microscopic features. Through this mechanism, HES achieved loading of 2.6 million uniformly distributed cells (≈5.2 × 104 cells mm−3) within a 2 min immersion in hAESCs suspension, rendering it a delivery tool with high hAESCs loading for SCI repair. In rat SCI models, HES–hAESCs treatment significantly improved hindlimb locomotion, as shown by discontinuous weight‐bearing crawling and active signals of motor evoked potential (MEP). The treatment also contributed to axonal projections and preservation of myelination. The underlying mechanisms involved hAESCs‐mediated inhibition of the immune response, and increased levels of neurotrophic factors around the lesions. These findings indicate that HES–hAESCs effectively improved the tissue microenvironment and ameliorated motor deficits in SCI rats.",
        "The proposed dual driving forces model provides a novel approach and underlying mechanism to enable self‐promoted cell uptake by hydrogel scaffolds. HES can serve as an efficient delivery tool to load multiple cell types. Additionally, it can also be packaged independently and manufactured into products suitable for long‐term storage and convenient clinical administration. Furthermore, hAESCs may be developed into a cellular agent compliant with good manufacturing practice, based on safety evaluation testing and clinical‐graded preparation. Taken together, our work provides a clinically‐translatable approach with potential for treating SCI.",
        "To achieve high and efficient cell loading within a unit volume scaffold, our focus was twofold: increasing the specific surface area and improving surface utilization in deep scaffolds. Initially, we designed a three‐period minimal surface (TPMS) characterized by interconnected pores, continuous and smooth 3D surfaces, and a large specific surface area. These structural advantages render the TPMS highly suitable for cell adhesion and circuit connections during SCI repair. When compared to the conventional poured solid structure and the general structure with channels, TPMS exhibits surface areas that are five and ten times larger specific surface area, respectively (Figure \n2a).",

        "Projection‐based 3D bioprinting (PBP) offers high precision, fast formation, and good repeatability, making it suitable for the fabrication of TPMS scaffolds (Figure 2b,c). GelMA is a photocurable and biocompatible hydrogel that can cross‐link under specific light conditions, and thus an ideal material for PBP. To ensure accurate fabrication, we determined the printability of GelMA‐PBP, and conducted a rheological property test to characterize state changes during crosslinking. Under intense printing light, GelMA reached the gel point (the intersection of G′ and G″ curves, Figure 2d) in ≈20 s, making it suitable for projection‐based bioprinting. The swelling property test indicated a maximum volume change rate of ≈8.5% upon reaching osmotic equilibrium within 6 h (Figure 2e). Hence, no significant errors were incurred. Moreover, GelMA was completely degraded by 50 U mL−1 type II collagenase after 32 h (Figure 2f), demonstrating its good biodegradability.",
        "To evaluate the impact of process parameters on errors, we utilized standard assessment methods.[\n\n40\n, \n41\n\n] The radial shape model was used to analyze the error within the x‐y plane, and the spiral staircase shape model was used for the z‐direction. Each model accurately calculated the current error values based on the model design parameters and only one measurement value. Using this approach, we examined the effect of three important parameters on printing errors: structural parameters, light absorber concentration, and GelMA material concentration (Figure 2g–i). Structural parameters could guide wall thickness design in TPMS scaffolds. Based on Figure 2g, we designed a structure with a wall thickness of 300 µm. The addition of a light absorber reduced light scattering and transmission, and thus significantly improved the printing accuracy. As Figure 2h showed, a 1% (w/v) light absorber concentration was selected. Figure 2i indicated GelMA concentration above 10% had a minimal impact on printing accuracy. Therefore, 15% was selected to meet the requirements of mechanical properties.",
        "The mechanical properties were evaluated using a previously reported method.[\n\n40\n\n] The tensile and compressive strains reached 125% (Figure 2j) and 68% (Figure 2k), respectively. These results indicated that the scaffold could withstand the deformation caused by subsequent surgeries. A significant difference was observed in the modulus at 10% strain and destructive strength between the compression and tensile tests (Figure 2l). In the SCI model, the scaffold was not sutured to lesions. Therefore, the TPMS scaffold was mainly subjected to compression rather than tension from surrounding tissues.",
        "Based on these results, we manufactured TPMS scaffolds with large specific surface area to increase cell‐loading capacity (Figure 2m,n).",
        "Although precisely fabricated TPMS GelMA hydrogel scaffolds exhibited a significantly increased cell‐carrying capacity, these hydrogels still lack satisfactory surface utilization and cell distribution levels, especially due to high flow resistance and gravity (Figure \n3a). In 3D space, cells tend to attach to surfaces perpendicular to gravity, and thereby result in an uneven distribution of cells on other surfaces, which reduces surface utilization within the scaffold. (Figure S1a,b, Supporting Information). These issues cannot be avoided even with different cell seeding methods, such as injection or dropwise addition of cell suspensions (Figure S1c,d, Supporting Information).",

        "To address this issue, we dehydrated hydrogel scaffolds, and proposed a dual driving forces model for efficient cell absorption. The scaffolds contracted after drying in an air oven. Volume swelling during rehydration is the macroscopic driving force of absorption. On the other hand, vacuum freeze‐drying led to a porous surface of the hydrogel scaffolds, providing a microscopic driving force via capillarity. These two driving forces ultimately resulted in a homogeneous distribution of cells on the surface of the scaffolds (Figure 3b).",
        "To test this hypothesis, we first tested the surface hydrophilicity of hydrogel sheets with different dehydration treatments using contact angle test. Hydrophilia declined rapidly with decreasing water content in the hydrogels treated only by drying. The completely dried surface exhibited super hydrophobicity, which was detrimental to cell attachment (Figure S2, Supporting Information). We applied different treatment strategies by combining drying and freeze‐drying. For instance, 90% of the water was removed by drying, and the remaining 10% was removed by freeze‐drying (named D&F 10%). Figure 3c demonstrated that surface of D&F 25% exhibited the smallest initial contact angle among all samples. After 15 s, the droplet on the D&F 25% surface was completely absorbed compared with the large contact angles on the other sheets. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images further explained the phenomena from the perspective of the surface microstructure. SEM results demonstrated that, in addition to the countless microchambers formed by the sublimated ice crystals during freeze‐drying, many cavities were also found on the walls between the chambers throughout the whole sample (Figure 3d; Figure S3, Supporting Information). Additionally, the number of cavities was found to be related to the freeze‐drying and drying rate. These cavities connect the microchambers to each other, allowing water to flow quickly into deep areas. Therefore, water filled the chambers in a short time, and the large surface area of the water‐free hydrogel began to seep. When rehydration occurred, the absorption speed increased rapidly with decreasing water content. This phenomenon is conducive to water absorption, and forms the positive feedback to accelerate this process.",
        "Subsequently, a line chart was constructed to more intuitively depict changes in contact angle over time. The D&F 25% surface was found to possess distinct hydrophilicity and water‐absorption, as evidenced by the smallest initial contact angle and fastest absorption rate among all fully dehydrated samples (Figure 3e). hAESCs were seeded onto hydrogel sheets from different treatment groups to test whether hydrophilicity and water‐absorbing capacity promote cell loading and attachment. The results showed the group treated with D&F 25% had a significant advantage over both the non‐treated scaffold (NTS) and D<1% groups, and this advantage in cell loading and attachment increased over time (Figure S4a, Supporting Information). Moreover, quantitative analysis of cell density on different hydrogel surfaces also supported the fluorescence results, demonstrating that an initial cell loading density of 663.7 cells mm−2 with D&F 25%, which reached 3169 cells mm−2 on day 7 (Figure S4b, Supporting Information). We thus termed this “super‐absorption and adhesion” (SAA) postprocessing. Specifically, a total of 75% of water was removed from NTS by drying. The loss of water caused significant volume shrinkage, which is more than 100 times that of the TPMS structure. The shrunken scaffolds were freeze‐dried to remove the remaining 25% water. Here, the remaining water gradually condenses into ice crystals uniformly distributed inside and on the surface of the scaffold. During vacuuming, these ice crystals sublimate, leaving many cavities in situ. Numerous microscopic pores further increase the specific surface area and hydrophilicity.",
        "To compare the absorption performances, 100 µL of PBS buffer was dropped onto the dried, freeze‐dried, and SAA‐treated TPMS scaffolds (Figure 3f; Figure S5, Supporting Information). The volume of the SAA‐treated scaffold dilated over 80 times in 150 s. The dried scaffold required nearly 20 min to complete absorption owing to its highly hydrophobic surface, and the freeze‐dried scaffold yielded a negative volume change rate, which had no effect on the formation of a macroscopic driving force. Consequently, SAA postprocessing enabled the hydrogel scaffold to obtain a hydrophilic surface, significant volume change, and porous microstructure to efficiently absorb liquids based on the dual driving forces mechanism. We termed this SAA‐treated TPMS scaffold as hyper expansion scaffold (HES).",
        "Taken together, we proposed a dual driving forces model, and elucidated its mechanism for efficient water absorption. Based on these results, we optimized the dehydration methods and developed SAA postprocessing to manufacture HES by combining the advantages of drying and freeze‐drying to achieve rapid water absorption by scaffold (Figure 3g). Next, we tested the scaffold by cell experiments in vitro.",
        "The need to improve the efficiency of the tedious cell seeding and cell‐loading on scaffolds has been recognized.[\n\n3\n, \n15\n\n] To determine whether HES improves the efficiency of cell seeding, we recorded the entire process of seeding of hAESCs onto the HES. Figure \n4a vividly showed all items used in this process, including sterile packaged HES and hAESCs. The procedure was divided into four parts: hAESCs and HES preparation, self‐promoted absorption, cultivation and implantation (Figure 4b–e). For practical use, hAESCs were thawed, and the proper number of cells was resuspended in a tube (according to the treatment requirement and size of the HES). Full dehydration facilitated storage and transport of sterile and independently packaged HES. The HES was then removed and immersed in the hAESCs suspension. After 2 min, the HES was expanded and filled with hAESCs, which was termed HES–hAESCs. Using this procedure, HES–hAESCs can be implanted immediately during an emergency, or cultured for several days until the most appropriate time for intervention.",

        "We then evaluated the cell viability, loading, and distribution of HES–hAESCs. Flow cytometric analysis indicated a much better cell viability on HES–hAESCs than that on cell‐laden printing (Figure S6a,b, Supporting Information). Moreover, rhodamine‐marked hAESCs were uniformly distributed throughout the HES from the surface to depths, as demonstrated by quantitative fluorescence statistics along the depth direction (Figure 4f). The CCK8 test indicated that hAESCs seeded on the HES exhibited the most robust proliferation and cell loading among all treated scaffolds (Figure 4g), which was consistent with the results of fluorescence staining (Figure 4h). Furthermore, hAESCs loading efficiency was assessed using the loss rate test, which demonstrated that only 3.42% of 1 million hAESCs were left unabsorbed by the HES. In contrast, 96.14% and 81.40% of the hAESCs were unabsorbed by the dried scaffold and NTS, respectively. The cell loss rate on the HES was maintained at a relative minimum even when 3 million hAESCs were seeded (Figure 4i). Notably, the loading limit of the HES was close to 2.6 million hAESCs, which was increased by 2 million cells compared with NTS (Figure 4j). Therefore, the cell density reached more than 5 × 104 cells mm−3 in the HES with the proper volume for rat SCI repair. Immunofluorescence staining further indicated that hAESCs fully covered the curved surface of the HES, and exhibited robust growth (Figure 4k) even on SAA‐treated scaffolds with regular stereoscopic structures (Figure 4l). We printed HES scaffolds of different sizes to assess their cell loading capacity (Figure S7a, Supporting Information). Size C scaffold, with a volume of ≈200 mm3, was found to be able to load more than 8.7 million hAESCs (Figure S7b, Supporting Information). Considering the actual size of the human spinal cord, the volumes of the SCI lesion and implanted scaffold in patients were much larger than those in rats. Thus, a scaffold suitable for human SCI wounds should carry tens of millions of cells with a cell density of ≈5 × 107 cells cm−3.",
        "Overall, these findings demonstrated that the HES delivery system was able to load high‐density and uniformly distributed hAESCs loading via an efficient self‐promoted absorption for in vivo applications. Additionally, the user‐friendly procedure contributes to the standardization of clinical use combined with commercialized HES and clinical‐grade hAESCs agent.",
        "Prior to evaluating therapeutic effects, we assessed the implantation feasibility of HES–hAESCs in rats by conducting in vivo cell survival and toxicology tests (Figure \n5a). While many studies implemented graft 2 weeks post‐injury due to the toxic and inflammatory environment at acute lesion sites, scaffolds could protect and support grafted cells survival in acute SCI.[\n\n3\n, \n13\n\n]",
        "Implantation feasibility of HES–hAESCs in rat SCI model. a) Experimental schematic.

        "To test the feasibility of our approach, we performed T10 laminectomy on Sprague‐Dawley rats and replaced a 2–3 mm block of the spinal cord with a dissociated hAESCs suspension and HES–hAESCs in the acute SCI phase (Figure 5b). Luciferase imaging demonstrated that a strong biosignal was detected in rats implanted with HES–hAESCs for more than 1 week. In contrast, the signal in the hAESCs‐treated rats dwindled rapidly within 3 days (Figure 5c). Statistical analysis indicated that the signal intensity in HES–hAESCs rats was significantly higher than that in the hAESCs‐treated group within 1 week, indicating significant protection by the scaffold for cell survival in the lesions (Figure 5d). Moreover, the immunofluorescence of Ki67 in prelabeled hAESCs suggested that a certain number of hAESCs could maintain their proliferation for 2 weeks (Figure 5e). Given the harsh microenvironment for hAESCs proliferation, the real ratio of cell survival was much higher than the staining ratio by Ki67 (Figure 5f). To evaluate the safety of our treatment approach, histological analysis of certain vital organs was conducted at 2 and 8 weeks post‐implantation. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the organs revealed normal histology at both time points, indicating that grafts were well‐tolerated across species (Figure 5g; Figure S8a,b, Supporting Information).",

        "Postoperative weight statistics indicated that rats treated with HES–hAESCs were healthier than FT rats at weeks 4 and 8 (Figure S9a,b, Supporting Information). Additionally, HES–hAESCs rats exhibited significantly higher locomotor recovery compared to those implanted with empty HES at 3 weeks after transplantation (Figure 6b), according to functional scoring described previously.[\n\n13\n, \n42\n\n] Specifically, HES–hAESCs rats reached a mean value of 7.0 ± 0.3 points (± s.e.m.) at 8 weeks post‐procedure, indicating extensive movement in approximately three joints of the hindlimb. In contrast, HES rats demonstrated only slight movement of two or three joints, and no obvious movement was observed in the FT controls, with a mean score of 0.8 ± 0.3 (± s.e.m.). Moreover, the implantation of hAESCs (cells suspension) showed only negligible improvement in locomotion recovery compared to FT rats (Figure S9c, Supporting Information), suggesting that hAESCs without scaffold support have limited functionality in the gap lesions of SCI. Therefore, the hAESCs‐treated rats were excluded from further experiments. We also recorded the gait and electromyograph (EMG) of the hindlimbs of the rats while crawling freely in an open field at 8 weeks post‐implantation. HES–hAESCs rats exhibited continuous steps of weight‐bearing walking on the hind palms (Figure 6c and Video S3, Supporting Information) compared with the dragging of hindlimbs in the FT group (Video S4, Supporting Information). EMG data showed improved amplitude and frequency in HES–hAESCs rats, suggesting an improvement in hindlimbs locomotion, which is consistent with the BBB scores as well (Figure S9d, Supporting Information).",
        "We further investigated the MEP signals of the hindlimbs to quantitatively assess the functional recovery and the degree of neural circuits connections (Figure 6d). EMG activity in the tibialis anterior (ankle flexor) muscle was detected in HES–hAESCs and HES rats, whereas no signal was observed in FT rats after stimulation. Thus, no functional neural circuit reconstruction could be achieved spontaneously in the SCI rats (Figure 6e). Importantly, the EMG activity in HES–hAESCs rats was significantly greater than that in HES rats, with the former reaching 40%–45% of the EMG activity of normal rats. This result further demonstrates that HES–hAESCs have a positive effect on the reconnection of descending neural circuits (Figure 6f). Moreover, the latency of MEP signals in HES–hAESCs rats was shortened after stimulation, allowing the rats to act agilely (Figure 6g,h).",
        "To examine the propriospinal axons descending through the lesion center, AAV2/9‐EGFP was injected into the upper thoracic spinal cord (T7) of rats two weeks before sacrifice (Figure 6i), as described elsewhere.[\n\n43\n\n] Few EGFP‐labeled axons were observed in the lesion areas of the HES or FT rats (Figure S9e, Supporting Information). However, in HES–hAESCs rats, EGFP signals were abundant at the rostral interface between the host and the graft, and some of these signals were caudally projected into the inner channels of the scaffolds (Figure 6j), with a maximum distance of more than 1.5 mm and a continuous length of ≈400 µm (Figure 6k,l). Additionally, we found a corresponding positional relationship between hAESCs and descending nerve fibers in the scaffold channels, suggesting that nerve fibers may interact with hAESCs for neurotrophy or nourishment to promote projection and extension (Figure S9f, Supporting Information). These findings demonstrates that the repair of descending neural circuits could be improved by HES–hAESCs, which mediate the recovery of hindlimbs locomotion in rats.",
        "Urinary system function is also critical in SCI repair. Analysis of bladder weight (Figure S10a,b, Supporting Information) and histology (Figure S10c, Supporting Information) revealed that HES–hAESCs significantly inhibited the pathological enlargement of the bladder, although differences from the normal bladder were also noted. This indicates that the intervention mitigated ‐to some extent‐ the structural damage to the bladder caused by urinary retention.",
        "Morphological analysis revealed that FT controls developed an atrophic lesion structure consistent with chronic injury pathology. In contrast, no atrophy occurred in two treatment groups, with the grafts tightly attached to the host tissues both rostrally and caudally (Figure S11a,b, Supporting Information). HE staining exhibited that lesions of HES–hAESCs were relatively robust and dense, unlike cavitary lesions in FT rats. We also found that the remaining scaffolds were stained dark purple, suggesting that the implanted scaffold functioned as a physical support for more than 8 weeks (Figure S11c, Supporting Information).",
        "Large numbers of NF‐H and GAP43‐labeled axons were aligned into linear arrays in the HES channels loaded with hAESCs, adopting a pattern mimicking the linear neural alignment of native tissue (Figure \n7a). At the lesion epicenter, numerous developing nerve fibers filled with inner channels were observed in HES–hAESCs rats and some exhibited mature characteristics with NF‐H positivity. In contrast, few and disordered neural fibers were found in HES rats (Figure 7b,c). The robust and well‐organized pattern of axons in the lesion area contributed to the recovery of locomotion in HES–hAESCs rats.",

        "We also found that the projection of nerve fibers in the microchannels of scaffolds in HES–hAESCs rats was significantly more vigorous than that in HES rats (Figure 7d). HES–hAESCs guided the projection of rostral and caudal axons and promoted their extension into depth. Magnified views demonstrated the robust morphology of nerve fibers in the internal channels (Figure 7e); the mean of 33 ± 7 axons per channel in HES–hAESCs rats were 10‐fold more than that in HES rats (Figure 7f). Moreover, NF‐H‐positive axons passed through the scaffold channels covered with hAESCs in view of the x–z and y–z sections, which is similar to the spatial position and function of cell nourishment in CST tracing (Figure 7g,h). Serotonergic axons, which modulate spinal motor systems, were also projected into the inner channels loaded with hAESCs and extended linearly from the rostral to caudal aspects of the scaffolds (Figure 7i).",
        "Ultrastructural analysis of the axons in the hAESCs‐filled channels revealed a variety of myelin structures with multiple calibers (Figure 7j), and some with oligodendrocytes involved in myelination that formed the myelin sheath (Figure 7k, yellow arrows). Excitatory synapses with rounded synaptic vesicles were also observed in hAESCs‐loaded microchannels (Figure S12a, Supporting Information). Additionally, the R‐ratio and other parameters of myelin sheath statistics demonstrated that robust myelination occurred in HES–hAESCs rats, which was conducive to relaying and integrating nerve signals (Figure 7l–n; Figure S12b, Supporting Information). These findings are consistent with the results of Luxol fast blue staining (Figure S12c, Supporting Information). Therefore, HES–hAESCs could significantly preserve the degree of myelination in lesions after SCI and further contribute to the synaptic structures that relay descending neural outputs.",
        "To explain mechanisms underlying the promotion of SCI repair by HES–hAESCs, we investigated the inflammatory responses and levels of neurotrophic factors around the injury epicenter over a 28‐day period based on the immunoregulation and paracrine properties of hAESCs (Figure \n8a). Neuroinflammation around lesions was evaluated over time at different time points, keeping all staining/imaging parameters consistent. HES–hAESCs significantly inhibited the activity of microglia and macrophages compared with HES and FT rats, as represented by the lower fluorescence of IBA1 and CD68 (Figure 8b,c). Statistical analysis demonstrated that HES–hAESCs inhibited the activation of microglia four days after transplantation (Figure 8d), whereas the inhibition of macrophages was mainly initiated approximately one week after injury (Figure 8e). Representative images of IBA1 and CD68 7 days post‐injury demonstrated significant effects of hAESCs on inflammation inhibition (Figure 8f,g). To our knowledge, the pro‐inflammatory property of macrophages peaks at one week post‐injury, and microglia are continuously reactivated after injury,[\n\n43\n\n] indicating that hAESCs play a critical role in the tough phase.",
        "Inflammation regulation and neurotrophy effects on local tissues by HES–hAESCs. a) Experimental schematic.

        "Consistent with the change in CD68 expression, the expression of IL‐6 and IL‐1β was reduced in HES–hAESCs, as revealed by qPCR analysis (Figure 8h). Furthermore, increased levels of the anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10 and neurotrophic factor BDNF demonstrated that an improved microenvironment for neural repair was created after implanting HES–hAESCs (Figure 8i). Therefore, we reasoned that hAESCs inhibit the activation of endogenous immune cells to suppress neuroinflammation after SCI. Increased neurotrophic levels further promote nerve growth for recovery of locomotion.",
        "The past decade has seen considerable advancement in SCI repair via 3D bioprinting, with various preclinical studies demonstrating effectiveness.[\n\n13\n, \n44\n, \n45\n, \n46\n, \n47\n\n] However, translation of the most promising interventions in laboratory animals to clinical practice has been limited.",
        "While various cell sources have been investigated, biosafety, ethics, and phenotypic matching are still the major concerns regarding clinical applications of seed cells. As precursors of multiple neural cells, neural stem cells (NSCs) theoretically confer benefits over alternatives for SCI repair.[\n\n48\n, \n49\n, \n50\n, \n51\n\n] However, NSCs show a propensity to generate astrocytes at the expense of multilineage neural cells during neuroinflammation after SCI, leading to regeneration failure.[\n\n52\n, \n53\n\n] Additionally, the application of NSCs is expensive with a low yield. Hence, NSCs are far from meeting the requirements of clinical utility at a large scale. Here, we delivered hAESCs rather than NSCs to animal models to prepare them for further clinical applications. hAESCs are derived from placenta and are widely available and inexpensive with no ethical concerns. Based on their specific location in native tissue, hAESCs are regarded as a barrier between the fetus and mother and exhibit hypoimmunogenicity and no telomerase expression.[\n\n30\n, \n31\n, \n54\n, \n55\n\n] The immunoregulatory characteristics of hAESCs facilitate the improvement of a microenvironment around the lesion during the acute phase. hAESCs also express and secrete neurotrophic factors that facilitate nerve growth and extension. Therefore, hAESCs have great potential for the clinical translation of SCI repair.",
        "Biomaterials are the backbone of engineered tissue scaffolds that support cell attachment and tissue regeneration.[\n\n56\n\n] Similar to cells and other issues used in clinical practice, safety and hypoimmunogenicity are essential requirements for biomaterials as well.[\n\n57\n\n] GelMA is a formable hydrogel that has been widely used for the repair and regeneration of various tissues with only few adverse reactions reported.[\n\n58\n, \n59\n\n] However, owing to its poor mechanical properties, GelMA has been mixed with some excipients to enhance its formability.[\n\n60\n, \n61\n, \n62\n\n] To meet clinical requirements, we avoided supplementing any other materials and realized the accurate manufacturing of pure GelMA with complex structures by optimizing printability. Thus, we could lower the “barrier to entry” for clinical application using a simple composition.",
        "Manufacturing is the process of combining cells with biomaterials to construct artificial tissues. For clinical use, the effect of this process on the cells should be minimal to maintain their viability and function. Cell‐laden bioprinting, which is a rapid and targeted 3D assembly of cells and materials, has gained considerable attention.[\n\n63\n\n] But free radicals are inevitably generated and released due to UV light and some initiators during the special mode of GelMA photocuring.[\n\n64\n, \n65\n\n] As part of the bio‐ink, cells suffer from the changes and stresses throughout the printing process, which may cause damage to cell activity and viability as evidenced by Figure S6b (Supporting Information). However, cell viability in our case (≈25%) was relatively low compared to that in our previous work.[\n\n66\n\n] This may be attributed to much harsher printing conditions, including increased light intensity and longer light exposure required by fine TPMS structure fabrication. In addition, hAESCs are a type of primary stem cells from the placental tissue, which are likely more sensitive and vulnerable to the printing process than other cell lines. Hence, we printed HES and subsequently seeded hAESCs instead of using cell‐laden printing to maintain the proper state and native characteristics of the cell grafts. Free radicals only existed when GelMA is exposed to ultraviolet light and are completely removed in the following operation.[\n\n67\n\n] Therefore, the issues about cellular damage and viability could be improved in our HES system.",
        "To date, numerous methods have been proposed to improve cell‐seeding efficiency on scaffolds, such as centrifugal spinning,[\n\n68\n\n] electrospinning,[\n\n69\n, \n70\n\n] centrifugal force,[\n\n71\n\n] micro‐pore structure,[\n\n72\n, \n73\n, \n74\n\n] medium perfusion,[\n\n75\n\n] and surface acoustic waves.[\n\n76\n\n] However, the common cellular density is ≈102 cells mm−2 or 105–106 cells cm−3, which is far from the initial cell density of native tissues.[\n\n77\n\n] To achieve more efficient cell seeding on scaffolds, we developed SAA postprocessing based on a dual driving forces model and fabricated the HES. The cell density and cell loading number improved significantly on both the 2D hydrogel surface and 3D scaffold, reaching the level of 3 × 103 cells mm−2 or 5 × 107–108 cells cm−3, respectively. Parallel to the enhanced cell‐loading capacity, the time spent on cell seeding was sharply reduced to ≈2 min in the HES system, which is a major step in efficient operation, considering the time spent of at least 30 min to 4 h in other post‐printing cellularization techniques.[\n\n72\n, \n73\n, \n75\n\n] Efficient cell loading and operation protocols are highly relevant for translation of HES to clinical applications. Further studies are needed to overcome the current upper limit of cell loading and attempt to seed multiple cell types with different functions to meet the physiological requirements of tissues and organs.",
        "Moreover, convenient and standardized operations are also important in practical using, especially for clinical applications. Complicated processes lead to high barriers of usage and increase the risk of instability in the therapeutic effects. Therefore, we divided the cell‐seeding process from scaffold manufacturing to meet the different requirements of cells and manufacturing from temporal and spatial perspectives. In HES–hAESCs system, cell seeding enables to finish automatically after immersing scaffolds into cell suspension due to the presence of dual driving forces. This one‐step method for cell seeding is user‐friendly and efficient to produce cell‐loaded scaffolds without introducing other factors such as centrifuging, perfusion and injection.[\n\n68\n, \n71\n, \n75\n\n] Thus, our proposal not only further simplifies the operation, but also reduces the potential damage on cell grafts.",
        "Standardized and consumable scaffold products, which are easy to store and transport, can be implemented by sterilization, lyophilization and modification. Additionally, standardized cell agents can be seeded on commercial scaffolds several hours or days in advance to construct artificial tissues according to the needs of the patients. Indeed, we have produced clinical‐grade hAESCs according to the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), whose safety and promising therapeutic effects have been proved in the clinical treatment of graft‐versus‐host disease (GVHD) (www.clinicaltrials.gov, #NCT03764228). In conclusion, this strategy is similar to the current clinical practice, with greater accessibility and stability, and could be suitable for clinical goals in the next decade.",
        "Our approach was specifically designed to consider clinical requirements. However, several issues still need to be resolved prior to translation from bench to bedside, including safety concerns regarding methacrylic anhydride in GelMA and the initiator during photocross‐linking, and the fate of implanted cells in vivo. To this end, a clinical perspective is crucial to sensitizing research to real world needs and driving integration of new technologies into medicine.",

    "title": "Ten-Year Outcome of Islet Alone or Islet After Kidney Transplantation in Type 1 Diabetes: A Prospective Parallel-Arm Cohort Study. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 10-year outcome of islet transplantation in patients with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycemia unawareness and/or a functioning kidney graft. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled in this prospective parallel-arm cohort study 28 subjects with type 1 diabetes who received islet transplantation either alone (ITA) or after a kidney graft (IAK). Islet transplantation consisted of two or three intraportal infusions of allogenic islets administered within (median [interquartile range]) 68 days (43-92). Immunosuppression was induced with interleukin-2 receptor antibodies and maintained with sirolimus and tacrolimus. The primary outcome was insulin independence with A1C </=6.5% (48 mmol/mol). Secondary outcomes were patient and graft survival, severe hypoglycemic events (SHEs), metabolic control, and renal function. RESULTS: The primary outcome was met by (Kaplan-Meier estimates [95% CI]) 39% (22-57) and 28% (13-45) of patients 5 and 10 years after islet transplantation, respectively. Graft function persisted in 82% (62-92) and 78% (57-89) of case subjects after 5 and 10 years, respectively, and was associated with improved glucose control, reduced need for exogenous insulin, and a marked decrease of SHEs. ITA and IAK had similar outcomes. Primary graft function, evaluated 1 month after the last islet infusion, was significantly associated with the duration of graft function and insulin independence. CONCLUSIONS: Islet transplantation with the Edmonton protocol can provide 10-year markedly improved metabolic control without SHEs in three-quarters of patients with type 1 diabetes, kidney transplanted or not. francois.pattou@univ-lille.fr.

Here, we identify that March5 and Trim28 as key modulators of β-cell function. March5 is downregulated and Trim28 upregulated in islets from human or mouse with impaired glucose tolerance. Loss of March5 in β-cells impairs insulin production and glucose tolerance, while its overexpression improves both.

        "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder affecting over 500 million people worldwide, characterized by impaired insulin secretion or peripheral insulin resistance, leading to hyperglycemia and related complications1–3. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β-cells, resulting in a complete lack of insulin. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) involves insufficient insulin secretion relative to insulin resistance, progressing to β-cell dysfunction and eventual insulin deficiency. Progressive loss of β-cell function is a key common feature of both T1D and T2D3–6. While exogenous insulin administration and oral hypoglycemic agents manage hyperglycemia and delay DM-related complications, they fail to prevent the progressive decline in β-cell function. Recently, islet transplantation has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for DM, aiming to restore endogenous insulin secretion and maintain glucose homeostasis7,8. Despite showing improved metabolic outcomes and reduced severe hypoglycemia compared to conventional insulin therapy, islet transplantation faces several challenges9–12, including limited donor availability and reduced insulin secretory capacity of isolated islets, etc.13,14. Mikaël Chetboun et al. reported a 5-year cumulative incidence of unsuccessful islet transplantation at 70.7%, with an inverse and linear correlation with primary graft function12,15–17. The success of islet transplantation depends on acquiring islets with normal or enhanced insulin expression and secretion capabilities. Understanding the mechanisms governing β-cell function and identifying key molecular determinants to bolster β-cell function presents significant therapeutic opportunities for diabetes and islet transplantation.",
        "Membrane-associated RING-CH-type finger 5 (March5), also known as MITOL (Mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase), is a pivotal E3 ligase implicated in mitochondrial dynamics and quality control18–21, as well as antiviral signaling, cell proliferation, and drug-induced cell death, which are independent of its mitochondria-related functions22–26. March5 is associated with diseases such as Parkinson’s disease27,28, Alzheimer’s disease29, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis30,31, ischemia-reperfusion injury32, sepsis33, and liver diseases22,34. Two recent studies demonstrate that March5 is closely associated with the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Simon T Bond et al. discovered that March5 expression in adipose tissue was significantly downregulated in obese individuals with elevated fasting blood glucose levels, mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a key regulator of adipogenesis35. Another study revealed that glucotoxicity upregulated March5 expression in cardiomyocytes, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent cardiomyocyte apoptosis36. Tripartite motif 28 (Trim28), a canonical RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is intricately involved in numerous biological processes, such as cell proliferation, cellular energy homeostasis, and apoptosis, by modulating degradation of key proteins37–39. Trim28 deficiency in adipocytes promotes obesity but maintains glucose tolerance40, indicating a potential role in glucose homeostasis. However, the roles of March5 and Trim28 in modulating β-cell function remain unexplored.",
        "Focal adhesion (FA) proteins are specialized subcellular structures that bridge the cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM). FA proteins mediate cell-ECM signaling by coupling integrin receptors on the plasma membrane with ECM components41,42. Previous studies have demonstrated that the activation status of FA proteins at β-cell-capillary interfaces in pancreatic islets is crucial for regulating calcium channel opening on the plasma membrane and insulin granule fusion-release processes following glucose stimulation43,44. Of note, as a key FA protein, Kindlin-2 downregulation leads to impaired insulin secretion in β-cells45. β-cell differentiation and function are intricately regulated by factors like MafA and Pdx1, etc.45–48, with MafA being central to insulin gene expression49. Kindlin-2 also regulates insulin gene expression in mice by stabilizing MafA protein45.",
        "In this study, we employ a comprehensive evaluation encompassing control mice alongside β-cell-specific March5 knockout or overexpression mice and establish the essential role of March5 in preserving β-cell function. Furthermore, the deleterious effects of HFD-induced progression of T2D are aggravated in mice lacking March5 in β-cells. Mechanistically, March5 directly ubiquitinates Trim28, inhibiting Trim28-mediated Kindlin-2 ubiquitination, resulting in increased MafA and insulin expression. We demonstrate that Trim28 expression in islets exhibits an opposite trend to that of March5. Genetic deletion of Trim28 in β-cells improves glucose homeostasis and effectively rescues the impaired glucose tolerance and diminished GSIS in March5-deficient mice. Importantly, islet transplantation with March5 overexpression or Trim28 deficiency in β-cells effectively ameliorates blood glucose levels in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model. Notably, MARCH5 upregulation or TRIM28 downregulation enhances insulin production and secretion in human islets. In conclusion, our findings underscore the critical role of the March5/Trim28/Kindlin-2/MafA axis in modulating β-cell insulin expression and secretion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in the treatment of diabetes.",
        "To study the potential role of March5 in pancreatic islet β-cells, we assessed the expression levels of March5 and insulin under various physiological and pathological conditions. Both protein and mRNA levels of MARCH5 and insulin were markedly reduced in islets from aged mice (18-month-old) (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c), mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) (Supplementary Fig. 1d–f), and leptin-deficient obese ob/ob mice (Supplementary Fig. 1g–i), compared to their respective controls. Moreover, a similar decline in MARCH5 and INSULIN expression was observed in human pancreatic islets from elderly individuals compared to young subjects (Fig. 1a–d). These findings suggest a potential positive association between March5 expression and islet β-cell function. We next analyzed the expression of MARCH5 and INSULIN in pancreatic islets of T2D patients using publicly available transcriptomic data from the NCBI GEO database (GSE25724)50. Both MARCH5 and INSULIN expression were significantly reduced in islets from T2D patients compared to non-diabetic controls (Fig. 1e).Fig. 1March5 expression is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis.a–d Immunofluorescence (IF) staining, Western blotting, and qPCR analyses of March5 and insulin expression in islets from human individuals with different ages.

        "The observed downregulation of March5 and insulin expression prompted us to explore the potential role of March5 in regulating the islet β-cells function. We generated β-cell-specific March5 knockout mice by crossing floxed March5 (March5 fl/fl) mice with the Ins2-Cre mice, resulting in β-cell-specific March5 knockout mice, referred to as March5 fl/fl; Ins2-Cre mice (cKO). The March5 fl/fl mice served as controls (referred to as CON). The mating strategy is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2a. The cKO mice were born in accordance with Mendelian inheritance patterns. Immunofluorescent (IF) staining of pancreatic tissues with antibodies against March5 and insulin revealed a significant reduction in both March5 and insulin expression within islet β-cells of cKO mice compared to CON mice (Fig. 1f, g). Additionally, Western blotting (WB) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) analyses demonstrated a substantial decrease in March5 expression at both protein and mRNA levels in isolated islets of cKO mice relative to CON mice, while March5 expressions in other organs, including the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and brain, remained unaltered (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). Subsequent IF staining demonstrated that March5 is also expressed in α- and δ-cells. However, its expression in these cell types remained largely unchanged in cKO mice. Comparable co-localization of March5 with glucagon or somatostatin was observed in pancreatic islets from both control and cKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e), confirming that March5 deletion was specific and efficient in islet β-cells of the cKO mice.",
        "Long-term body weight monitoring from birth revealed growth retardation in both male (Fig. 1h) and female (Supplementary Fig. 3a) cKO mice starting at 2–3 weeks of age. To further investigate the impact of March5 deficiency on glucose homeostasis, we conducted a glucose tolerance test (GTT). Following an overnight fast, mice received intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of glucose (2 g/kg body weight), with blood samples collected at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min for blood glucose measurement. Results indicated that blood glucose levels were significantly elevated in 10-week-old male cKO mice compared to sex- and age-matched CON mice at 30, 60, and 90 min (Fig. 1i, j). The blood glucose monitoring and insulin tolerance tests (ITT) revealed no significant differences in random blood glucose (RBG), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and insulin sensitivity between cKO mice and CON mice (Supplementary Fig. 3b–d). A similar pattern of glucose intolerance was observed in 3-month-old female cKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 3e–i). Subsequently, male mice were exclusively utilized to minimize the overall number of animals used.",
        "Next, we performed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assays to investigate whether March5 deficiency affects insulin secretion. Blood insulin levels were measured at 0, 3, 6, 10, and 30 min after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of glucose (2 g/kg body weight). The results showed that insulin secretion was markedly impaired at 0 and 3 min in cKO mice compared to CON mice (Fig. 1k). Although GTT assays showed an unchanged level of fasting blood glucose between cKO and CON mice, the level of fasting blood insulin in cKO mice was significantly reduced due to March5 deficiency (Fig. 1k and Supplementary Fig. 3j).",
        "To investigate the role of March5 in diabetes progression, 6-week-old male cKO and CON mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce a T2D model. Long-term monitoring of body weight revealed that cKO mice developed more pronounced obesity compared to CON mice (Fig. 1l). After 12 weeks of HFD feeding, both groups exhibited RBG levels exceeding 11.1 mM, confirming the successful induction of T2D. Of note, both RBG and FBG levels were significantly elevated in cKO mice relative to CON mice (Supplementary Fig. 3k). GTT revealed markedly higher blood glucose levels at all time points in cKO mice compared to sex- and age-matched CON mice (Fig. 1m, n), accompanied by more severe defects in insulin secretion (Fig. 1o). These impairments were more pronounced than those observed under the normal chow diet (NCD) conditions (Fig. 1i, j). ITT further showed a modest but significant reduction in peripheral insulin sensitivity in cKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 3l, m). Together, these data indicate that March5 deficiency in islet β-cells accelerates the onset and progression of T2D.",
        "We further generated β-cell-specific March5 overexpression mouse model by crossing March5OE mice with Ins2-Cre mice, yielding March5OE; Ins2-Cre mice (hereafter referred to as M5OE). Littermate March5OE mice lacking the Cre transgene were used as control mice (hereafter referred to as CON). IF staining and Western blot analysis confirmed markedly increased March5 expression in islet β-cells of M5OE mice compared with CON mice (Supplementary Fig. 3n–p). Long-term monitoring of body weight showed no significant differences between M5OE and CON mice (Fig. 1p). While RBG and FBG levels were comparable between 10-week-old male M5OE and CON mice (Supplementary Fig. 3q), GTT assays showed significantly enhanced glucose clearance in M5OE mice at 30 and 60 min post-glucose administration (Fig. 1q, r). Notably, GSIS assays revealed a substantial elevation in insulin release in M5OE mice compared with CON mice (Fig. 1s). ITT results showed no significant differences in peripheral insulin sensitivity between M5OE and CON mice (Supplementary Fig. 3r, s). A similar improvement in glucose tolerance was also observed in 4-month-old female M5OE mice (Supplementary Fig. 3t–x). To reduce animal usage, subsequent experiments were conducted using male mice only. Together, these findings indicate that March5 overexpression in β-cells promotes insulin secretion and improves systemic glucose clearance.",
        "The in vivo GSIS assays suggested impaired insulin secretion caused by β-cell March5 deficiency. To further confirm the requirement for March5 for insulin release, primary islets isolated from cKO and CON mice were treated with either 2.8- or 16.7-mM glucose in vitro. Insulin protein levels in the culture supernatants were quantified and normalized to the DNA content of the islets. In CON islets, high-glucose stimulation led to an ~6-fold increase in insulin secretion, whereas the response in cKO islets was significantly blunted, with only an ~4-fold increase (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, perifusion assays revealed that both the first- and second phase of insulin secretion were dramatically attenuated in islets from cKO mice compared to controls (Fig. 2b, c). These results suggest that impaired in vivo insulin secretion in cKO mice is attributed to insulin release. Since Ca2+ influx in β-cells is a critical step for the exocytosis of insulin secretory vesicles, we next assessed glucose- and KCl-induced Ca2+ release. Results showed that March5 deficiency impaired both glucose- and KCl-induced Ca2+ release from cKO islets. Under stimulation with 16.7 mM glucose, Ca2+ release was significantly reduced in cKO islets compared to CON islets (Fig. 2d). Similarly, the amplitude of Ca2+ transients induced by 25 mM KCl was also significantly decreased in cKO islets compared to CON islets (Fig. 2d). Next, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to observe and quantify insulin granules in single β-cells from CON and cKO mice. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed a diminished number of insulin secretory granules, including docked granules, in islets from cKO mice compared to controls (Fig. 2e, f). These findings are consistent with the reduced insulin levels observed in cKO islets (Fig. 1f), indicating that the impaired in vivo insulin secretion also attributed to impaired insulin production in cKO mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate that March5 is essential for insulin expression and granule exocytosis in β-cells.Fig. 2March5 deficiency reduces insulin expression and secretion by inhibiting Ca2+ release and MafA expression.a In vitro GSIS.

        "In addition to the decrease in insulin expression by islet β-cells, the reduction in total insulin levels could also be attributed to increased apoptosis or decreased proliferation of β-cells51–54. We next investigated whether March5 regulates β-cell area. Firstly, we performed IHC staining using an insulin-specific antibody and measured the β-cell area-to-pancreas ratio and β-cell mass. Results showed no significant differences in β-cell area or β-cell mass between cKO and CON mice (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). Additionally, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining revealed no significant differences in β-cell apoptosis between cKO and CON mice (Supplementary Fig. 4d–f). Consistently, insulin expression was significantly reduced in islets from cKO mice (Fig. 1f). These results suggest that the loss of March5 directly reduces insulin expression without affecting β-cell mass.",
        "Next, we examined the expression of genes involved in insulin production, insulin, β-cell identity, including Ins1, Ins2, Exoc6, Styl3, Glut2, MafA, Pdx1, and Nkx6.145–48. QPCR analysis revealed significant downregulation of Ins1, Ins2, Exoc6, and Styl3 in islets from cKO mice, whereas the expression of MafA, Pdx1, and Nkx6.1 remained unchanged compared to CON islets (Fig. 2g). Given that MafA is a key transcriptional regulator of insulin gene expression49, we next determined whether March5 modulates MafA protein levels. IHC staining and WB analyses demonstrated a dramatic reduction in MafA protein levels in the islets of cKO mice (Fig. 2h–j). Similarly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of March5 in INS1 cells led to a significant decrease in both MafA and insulin protein levels (Fig. 2k, l). In contrast, March5 overexpression resulted in enhanced in vivo GSIS and opposite gene expression pattern compared to cKO mice (Fig. 2m, n). Consistently, MafA and insulin protein levels were significantly increased in the islets of M5OE mice and in March5-overexpressing INS1 cells, compared to their respective controls (Fig. 2o–r and Supplementary Fig. 4g–j). Similarly, β-cell mass was comparable between M5OE and CON mice (Supplementary Fig. 4k–m). Collectively, these findings suggest that March5 enhances insulin expression primarily through upregulation of MafA protein levels, without altering its transcription, in islet β-cells.",
        "Considering the close association of March5 with mitochondrial dynamics, we performed a detailed analysis of mitochondrial morphology using TEM. No significant differences were observed in mitochondrial length or area between β-cells from CON and cKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). These findings were further supported by IF staining with Mitotracker in March5-knockdown INS1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). Moreover, measurements of cellular energy status revealed no significant differences in either relative ATP levels or ATP/ADP ratios between March5-deficient and control INS1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5g, h), indicating that March5 deficiency does not impair mitochondrial function in β-cells.",
        "To investigate how March5 modulates MafA protein levels and insulin dynamics, we conducted mRNA sequencing on islets from 10-week-old CON and cKO mice. KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment in pathways related to insulin secretion, ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion (FA), and cell adhesion (Fig. 3a), all linked to FA proteins. Notably, FA proteins, such as Kindlin-2 and Talin-1, are key regulators of various cellular processes. We previously reported that β-cell-specific deletion of Talin-1 results in altered β-cell mass without affecting insulin secretion55. Kindlin-2 has been shown to stabilize MafA and promote insulin expression, and its deficiency markedly impairs insulin secretion, probably by disrupting cytoskeletal architecture and extracellular matrix (ECM)–receptor interactions essential for insulin granule trafficking and release45,56–58. Given that March5 knockout in β-cells led to reduced MafA and insulin protein levels as well as impaired insulin secretion, we hypothesized that these effects might be mediated through Kindlin-2. To explore this possibility, we first assessed Kindlin-2 expression in pancreatic sections and isolated islets using IHC staining and western blotting. We observed a substantial reduction in Kindlin-2 protein in islets of cKO mice compared with CON mice, whereas March5-overexpressing (M5OE) mice displayed significantly elevated Kindlin-2 levels (Fig. 3b–g). Consistently, siRNA-mediated knockdown of March5 in INS1 cells markedly decreased Kindlin-2 protein levels (Fig. 3h, i), while March5 overexpression resulted in a marked increase (Fig. 3j, k). Notably, qPCR analyses revealed that Kindlin-2 mRNA levels remained unchanged following March5 knockdown or expression (Fig. 3l–n), suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. Importantly, the decrease in MafA protein caused by March5 knockdown was effectively reversed by Kindlin-2 overexpression, and conversely, the enhanced MafA expression resulting from March5 overexpression was abrogated by Kindlin-2 knockdown (Fig. 3o–r), further supporting a mechanistic link between March5 and MafA via Kindlin-2.Fig. 3March5 regulates MafA expression by modulating Kindlin-2 protein levels.a Enrichment of cell transport and cell adhesion-associated KEGG signaling pathways in islets from cKO mice compared to CON mice. b–e IHC staining for Kindlin-2.

        "Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that March5 regulates MafA and insulin protein levels, as well as insulin secretion, through a Kindlin-2–dependent mechanism.",
        "We next investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the regulation of Kindlin-2 protein levels by March5. Cycloheximide (CHX) experiments in INS1 cells revealed a significant acceleration in Kindlin-2 protein degradation following March5 knockdown (Fig. 3s, t). To identify the degradation pathway involved, we treated INS1 cells with MG132 or Chloroquine (CQ), inhibitors of the proteasome and lysosome pathways, respectively. WB analyses demonstrated a notable increase in Kindlin-2 protein levels upon MG132 treatment, while CQ treatment had no discernible effect on Kindlin-2 protein levels (Fig. 3u, v), suggesting that Kindlin-2 degradation primarily occurs via the proteasome pathway. Moreover, March5 knockdown in INS1 cells markedly increased the ubiquitination of endogenous Kindlin-2 (Fig. 3w). Taken together, these results suggest that March5 deficiency accelerates Kindlin-2 protein degradation through enhancing its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation.",
        "We further investigated the role of Kindlin-2 in mediating the impact of March5 deficiency on diabetic phenotypes in vivo by generating mice with specific deletion of one allele of March5 and/or Kindlin-2 genes in β-cells using Ins2-Cre mice. This resulted in the generation of singly heterozygous mice for March5 or Kindlin-2 (M5 fl/+; Ins2-Cre or K2 fl/+; Ins2-Cre) and double heterozygous mice (i.e., M5 fl/+; K2 fl/+; Ins2-Cre), with Ins2-Cre mice as controls. No significant difference in growth was observed among these four genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 6a). GTT assays conducted on 2-month-old male mice of these four genotypes indicated that M5 fl/+; Ins2-Cre or K2 fl/+; Ins2-Cre mice displayed no discernible variations in blood glucose clearance compared to control Ins2-Cre mice. However, M5 fl/+; K2 fl/+; Ins2-Cre mice exhibited notably compromised glucose clearance compared to the other three groups (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c). Furthermore, ITT assays showed no significant difference in peripheral insulin sensitivity among the four groups (Supplementary Fig. 6d, e). GSIS assays demonstrated impaired insulin secretion in March5 and Kindlin-2 double heterozygous mice compared to singly heterozygous or control mice (Supplementary Fig. 6f). Additionally, no significant difference in β-cell mass was observed among mice among the four groups (Supplementary Fig. 6g). IF staining revealed a marked decrease in March5 signal in the islets of M5 fl/+; Ins2-Cre and M5 fl/+; K2 fl/+; Ins2-Cre mice, but no change in K2 fl/+; Ins2-Cre mice compared to control Ins2-Cre mice (Supplementary Fig. 6h, i). IHC staining showed that Kindlin-2 expression was markedly reduced in the islets of both M5 fl/+; Ins2-Cre and K2 fl/+; Ins2-Cre mice, with further reduction observed in the islets of M5 fl/+; K2 fl/+; Ins2-Cre mice, relative to control Ins2-Cre mice (Supplementary Fig. 6h, j). MafA (Supplementary Fig. 6h, k) and insulin (Supplementary Fig. 6h, l) expression remained unchanged in the islets of M5 fl/+; Ins2-Cre and K2 fl/+; Ins2-Cre mice, but were significantly decreased in the islets of M5 fl/+; K2 fl/+; Ins2-Cre mice, compared to control Ins2-Cre mice. These findings are consistent with a previous report showing that Kindlin-2 heterozygosity in β-cells does not affect glucose clearance45. Collectively, these data suggest that March5 functions upstream of Kindlin-2 and MafA, with March5 regulating β-cell function by modulating Kindlin-2 expression and MafA activity within the same genetic pathway.",
        "Based on the results of our previous experiments and the known function of March5 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, we hypothesized the involvement of another E3 ubiquitin ligase in the regulation of Kindlin-2 by March5. To identify potential E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in Kindlin-2 protein degradation, we conducted mass spectrometry and identified Trim28 as the only E3 ubiquitin ligase found to interact with Kindlin-259. Subsequent IF staining demonstrated the co-localization of Trim28 and Kindlin-2 in INS1 cells (Fig. 4a). Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays validated the protein interaction between Trim28 and Kindlin-2 (Fig. 4b, c). These findings indicate that Trim28 may function as the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the ubiquitination of Kindlin-2. Next, we investigated the relationship between March5, Trim28, and Kindlin-2. IHC staining revealed a significant increase in Trim28 expression in the islets of cKO mice, whereas Trim28 levels were significantly decreased in the islets of M5OE mice (Fig. 4d–g). Notably, Trim28 expression was significantly upregulated upon March5 knockdown, and silencing Trim28 effectively reversed the decrease in Kindlin-2 levels caused by March5 knockdown in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4h, i). Conversely, Trim28 expression was markedly reduced by March5 overexpression, and Trim28 overexpression sufficiently counteracted the increase in Kindlin-2 levels induced by March5 overexpression in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4j, k). Furthermore, IF staining demonstrated the co-localization of Marhc5 and Trim28 in INS1 cells (Fig. 4l), while co-IP assays validated the protein interaction between March5 and Trim28 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4m). Collectively, these results indicate that March5 promotes Kindlin-2 protein levels by inhibiting the expression of Trim28.Fig. 4March5 promotes Kindlin-2 protein levels by inhibiting Trim28.a IF staining.

        "Next, we determined the mechanisms underlying March5 regulation of Trim28. Knockdown of March5 expression in vivo and in vitro led to a significant increase in Trim28 protein levels, as revealed by WB analyses (Fig. 5a–c), while the mRNA levels of Trim28 remained unaltered, as demonstrated by qPCR analyses (Fig. 5d, e). Conversely, a marked reduction in Trim28 protein levels, without changes in mRNA expression, was observed in isolated islets from M5OE mice compared to CON mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). CHX experiments revealed that March5 knockdown significantly decelerated Trim28 protein degradation (Fig. 5f, g). WB analyses demonstrated a notable increase in Trim28 protein accumulation following MG132 treatment (Fig. 5h, i), suggesting that Trim28 degradation is predominantly mediated through the proteasome pathway. Notably, March5 knockdown significantly decreased the ubiquitination level of Trim28 (Fig. 5j). Conversely, March5 overexpression effectively enhanced the ubiquitination level of Trim28 (Fig. 5k).Fig. 5March5 inhibits Trim28-mediated ubiquitination of Kindlin-2 by directly ubiquitinating Trim28.a Western blot analyses for March5, Trim28, and actin expression in isolated islets from 10-week-old male cKO and CON mice. b, c Western blot analyses.

        "To further investigate whether the E3 ligase activity of March5 is necessary for Trim28 protein ubiquitination, we mutated histidine 43 (H43W) in the RING domain of March5, which is essential for its ubiquitin-transfer function22,60. We then assessed the degradation status of Trim28 protein under different conditions in HEK293T cells. Notably, there were no significant differences in the expression and degradation levels of Trim28 protein between March5 with the H43W mutation and the Flag control, while the ubiquitination of Trim28 was markedly increased under wild-type March5 overexpression (Fig. 5l and Supplementary Fig. 7c, d). These findings suggest that March5 directly interacts with and ubiquitinates Trim28.",
        "Next, we determined the mechanisms underlying Trim28 regulation of Kindlin-2. Since Kindlin-2 mRNA expression was unaltered by March5 deficiency (Fig. 3l–n), and Trim28 is known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, we hypothesized that Trim28 regulates Kindlin-2 protein stability via ubiquitination. Our IF staining and co-IP assays already demonstrated the co-localization and protein interaction between Trim28 and Kindlin-2 (Fig. 4a–c). CHX experiments revealed that Trim28 knockdown significantly attenuated Kindlin-2 protein degradation in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5m, n). Moreover, Trim28 knockdown significantly reduced the ubiquitination of Kindlin-2 protein (Fig. 5o). Notably, Trim28 knockdown effectively reversed the elevated ubiquitination level of Kindlin-2 caused by March5 knockdown in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5p). Conversely, Trim28 overexpression reversed the decreased ubiquitination level of Kindlin-2 caused by March5 overexpression in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5q).",
        "Taken together, these findings demonstrate that March5 promotes the ubiquitination of Trim28, thereby inhibiting the Trim28-mediated degradation of Kindlin-2. This leads to the accumulation of Kindlin-2 and MafA, ultimately enhancing β-cell function.",
        "Since the role of Trim28 in β-cells in regulating glucose homeostasis is unknown, we initially detected the expression of Trim28 in mouse or human islets under different conditions. We observed a notable increase in Trim28 signal in islets of aged mice (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). Similarly, Trim28 levels were markedly enhanced in islets from HFD-fed mice and leptin-deficient obese ob/ob mice (Supplementary Fig. 8c–f). Moreover, IF staining revealed a significant increase in TRIM28 and a concomitant decline in INSULIN in human pancreatic islets from elderly individuals compared to younger subjects (Supplementary Fig. 8g, h).",
        "Next, we generated β-cell-specific Trim28 deletion mouse model to study the in vivo role of β-cell Trim28 in regulating glucose homeostasis (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). No significant differences were observed in the growth, RBG, and FBG of Trim28fl/fl and Trim28fl/fl; Ins2-Cre mice (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). GTT assays conducted on 12-week-old male mice indicated that Trim28fl/fl; Ins2-Cre mice had better blood glucose clearance than control Trim28fl/fl mice at 30 and 60 min after glucose injection (Fig. 6a, b). GSIS assays demonstrated significantly higher insulin secretion in Trim28fl/fl; Ins2-Cre mice at 3 and 6 min following glucose administration compared to control mice (Fig. 6c). Consistently, in vitro GSIS analyses showed an ~7.6-fold increase in insulin secretion in islets from Trim28fl/fl; Ins2-Cre mice, compared to a 6-fold increase in control islets (Fig. 6d). ITT assays showed no significant differences in peripheral insulin sensitivity between the two groups (Supplementary Fig. 9e, f), and β-cell mass was also comparable (Supplementary Fig. 9g). Western blotting, qPCR, and IHC staining revealed markedly increased expression of Kindlin-2, MafA, and insulin in islets from Trim28fl/fl; Ins2-Cre mice relative to controls, while March5 expression remained unchanged (Fig. 6e–g and Supplementary Fig. 9h–l). Collectively, these results further indicate that March5 functions upstream of the Trim28/Kindlin-2/MafA axis.Fig. 6Deletion of Trim28 in β-cells significantly enhances β-cell function and completely reverses the diabetic phenotype induced by March5 knockout in mice.a GTT. 12-week-old Trim28fl/fl and Trim28fl/fl; Ins2-Cre male mice were subjected to GTT. b Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated based on the data presented in (a). c GSIS. 16-week-old male mice were subjected to GSIS.

        "Collectively, these findings indicate the critical role of Trim28 in modulating islet β-cell function",
        "We next investigated whether genetic deletion of Trim28 in β-cells could reverse the diabetic phenotypes caused by March5 deficiency by generating mice with simultaneous deletion of both March5 and Trim28 genes in β-cells using Ins2-Cre mice. Notably, Trim28 deletion completely reversed the growth retardation (Supplementary Fig. 9m), glucose intolerance, and decreased insulin secretion observed in March5 knockout mice (Fig. 6h–k). Consistently, Western blotting, qPCR, and IHC staining revealed that the decreased expression of Kindlin-2, MafA, and insulin resulting from March5 deletion was efficiently reversed by Trim28 deletion (Fig. 6l–n and Supplementary Fig. 9n–r). Similarly, no significant differences were observed in RBG, FBG, peripheral insulin sensitivity, and β-cell mass among the three groups (Supplementary Fig. 9s–v).",
        "Collectively, these findings further demonstrate that March5 maintains β-cell function by targeting Trim28.",
        "We further evaluated the impact of March5 deficiency on glucose homeostasis in adult mice using a mouse model with conditional March5 alleles (March5 fl/fl) and an Ins1-CreERT transgene, which allows for tamoxifen (TM)-inducible Cre recombinase expression specifically in β-cells. Two-month-old mice received TM injections (100 mg/kg body weight) for five consecutive days to induce deletion of March5 expression in β-cells (hereafter referred to as March5 fl/fl; Ins1-CreERT) (Supplementary Fig. 10a). At 30 days post-TM injections, March5 fl/fl; Ins1-CreERT mice exhibited significant impairment in glucose clearance and insulin secretion, as indicated by GTT and GSIS assays, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 10b–d). There were no significant differences in β-cell mass or peripheral insulin sensitivity between March5 fl/fl; Ins1-CreERT and control March5 fl/fl mice (Supplementary Fig. 10e–g). Consistent with findings from cKO mice (March5 fl/fl; Ins2-Cre mice), IF and IHC staining revealed a marked reduction in the expression of March5, Kindlin-2, MafA, and insulin in the islets of March5 fl/fl; Ins1-CreERT mice compared to control March5 fl/fl littermates (Supplementary Fig. 10h–l). In contrast, Trim28 expression was markedly elevated in the islets of March5 fl/fl; Ins1-CreERT mice relative to control littermates (Supplementary Fig. 10h, m).",
        "Collectively, these findings indicate that March5 is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis in adult mice and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for diabetes.",
        "Based on our previous findings, we identified March5 as a key facilitator and Trim28 as a potent suppressor of insulin expression and secretion in islet β-cells. We then initiated investigations to determine whether enhancing March5 or inhibiting Trim28 expression could be viable strategies for diabetes treatment. Initially, syngeneic islet transplantation experiments were conducted to evaluate whether islets overexpressing March5 in β-cells could improve metabolic control. Streptozotocin (STZ) was administered to induce diabetes in C57BL/6 WT mice. One-week post-STZ treatment, fasting glucose concentrations in all mice exceeded 11.1 mM, confirming the establishment of the STZ-induced diabetic mouse model. Subsequently, primary islets were isolated from 3-month-old CON and M5OE mice. Our previous findings demonstrated that March5 knockout (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c) or overexpression (Supplementary Fig. 4k–m) did not affect β-cell mass. Six hundred primary islets from CON and M5OE mice were intramuscularly injected into the hindlimb muscle of STZ-induced diabetic recipient mice. IF staining of insulin and TUNEL assays indicated a significant increase in TUNEL-positive β-cell numbers in STZ-induced diabetic mice compared to control mice (Fig. 7a, b). Insulin expression was dramatically decreased in STZ-treated mice compared to control mice (Fig. 7a, c), further confirming the successful establishment of the STZ-induced diabetic mouse model. IF staining of insulin demonstrated the viability and functionality of the transplanted islets in the hindlimb muscle of recipient mice (Fig. 7d). Fasting (4 h) blood glucose measurements showed that diabetic recipient mice transplanted with islets from CON (STZ-CON) or M5OE (STZ-M5OE) mice achieved glycemic control within ~2 weeks (Fig. 7e). Remarkably, mice transplanted with islets from M5OE mice (STZ-M5OE) displayed lower blood glucose levels compared to mice in the STZ-CON group. We next investigated whether inhibition of Trim28 in β-cells enhances glucose tolerance in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Similarly, islets from both Trim28fl/fl and Trim28fl/fl; Ins2-Cre mice successfully decreased blood glucose levels within ~2 weeks post-transplantation (Fig. 7f–j). Notably, from day 24 post-transplantation, mice receiving islets from Trim28fl/fl; Ins2-Cre mice displayed significantly lower blood glucose levels compared to the Trim28fl/fl group (Fig. 7j).Fig. 7MARCH5 overexpression or TRIM28 knockdown enhances insulin expression and secretion.a–c IF staining of insulin and TUNEL in pancreatic sections.

        "Taken together, these findings suggest that islet transplantation with either March5-overexpressing or Trim28-deficient β-cells significantly enhances glucose clearance capacity of diabetic mice.",
        "To further investigate whether MARCH5 overexpression or TRIM28 inhibition in human islets enhances insulin expression and secretion, we induced MARCH5 overexpression (M5OE) or TRIM28 inhibition (TRIM28KD) in freshly isolated human islets via lentiviral transduction (Fig. 7k, l), followed by GSIS assays. Upon exposure to 16.7 mM glucose, insulin secretion rose markedly, with an ~6-fold increase in NC islets (Fig. 7m), a 10-fold increase in M5OE islets (Fig. 7m), and an 8-fold increase in TRIM28KD islets (Fig. 7n).",
        "Overall, these findings highlight the potential benefits of enhancing March5 or inhibiting Trim28 signaling in islet β-cells for improving insulin expression and secretion, which is of direct relevance to clinical islet transplantation where donor islets are limited in supply.",
        "Although Ins2-Cre is widely used for β-cell-specific gene manipulation, previous studies have noted ectopic expression in the hypothalamus61, a key center for regulating feeding and satiety. To address the potential impact of such off-target recombination, we performed whole-brain western blot and qPCR analyses, which revealed no significant differences in March5 protein or mRNA levels between β-cell-specific March5 knockout mice and littermate controls (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b), nor in Trim28 expression between β-cell-specific Trim28 knockout mice and controls (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). Nonetheless, the use of whole-brain lysates may mask region-specific alterations, subtle changes within the hypothalamus cannot be definitively excluded. To further assess this possibility, we assessed feeding behavior. Daily food intake was comparable between β-cell-specific knockout mice and their corresponding controls (Supplementary Fig. 11), suggesting that any potential ectopic Ins2-Cre activity in the hypothalamus does not significantly influence the observed metabolic phenotypes.",
        "In the present study, we elucidate a mechanism regulating β-cell function and blood glucose homeostasis, involving the E3 ligases March5 and Trim28. Our findings demonstrate that March5 enhances β-cell insulin expression and secretion by facilitating the ubiquitination of Trim28, which in turn inhibits Trim28-mediated ubiquitination of Kindlin-2. Consequently, MafA protein levels are increased, leading to upregulated insulin expression and secretion. We provide compelling evidence supporting the pivotal roles of March5 and Trim28 in modulating β-cell insulin expression and secretion. Notably, our study reveals that enhancing March5 or inhibiting Trim28 expression in islets from both mice and human donors significantly improves β-cell function. These findings hold substantial importance, as impaired β-cell insulin expression and secretion are fundamental pathological features of diabetes.",
        "Our investigation represents the inaugural demonstration of the E3 ligase March5 as a positive regulator of insulin expression and secretion. This conclusion is supported by multiple lines of evidence: (1) reduced expression of March5 in islet β-cells of individuals with impaired glucose homeostasis in both mice and in humans; (2) attenuated insulin expression and secretion in β-cells due to March5 deficiency; (3) pronounced glucose intolerance caused by inducible deletion of March5 in islet β-cells of adult mice; and (4) significant enhancement of insulin expression and secretion upon upregulation of March5 expression in human or mouse islet β-cells. These findings unveil for the first time that March5 is a prospective therapeutic target for improving β-cell function. Although several studies have highlighted the critical role of March5 in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function18–21, our findings suggest that its role in maintaining β-cell function, as demonstrated in the present study, operates independently of its effects on mitochondrial dynamics. This conclusion is supported by our TEM and ATP/ADP analyses, which revealed no significant differences in mitochondrial morphology or activity between β-cells from CON and cKO mice.",
        "In this study, we reveal that March5 enhances β-cell insulin expression and secretion through promoting Kindlin-2/MafA signaling. Firstly, March5 deficiency decreases, while March5 overexpression increases, both Kindlin-2 and MafA protein levels without affecting their mRNA levels in β-cells, both in vivo and in vitro. Secondly, the reduced expression of MafA protein caused by March5 deficiency can be reversed by Kindlin-2 overexpression, and vice versa. Thirdly, March5 deficiency accelerates the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Kindlin-2 protein. Finally, the simultaneous haploinsufficiency of both March5 and Kindlin-2 genes, rather than either gene alone, in β-cells of mice significantly diminishes insulin expression and secretion, consequently leading to glucose intolerance. Thus, our study provides the first in vivo evidence highlighting the collaborative action of both March5 and Kindlin-2 within the same genetic pathway in β-cells, which is crucial for the regulation of β-cell function and glucose homeostasis in mice.",
        "March5 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. The positive correlation between Kindlin-2 protein levels and March5 expression suggests the involvement of an additional E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates the regulation of Kindlin-2 protein by March5. Our study provides compelling evidence that Trim28 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for this regulation. Firstly, mass spectrometry identifies Trim28 as the sole E3 ligase interacting with Kindlin-2. Secondly, co-IP assays and IF staining confirm the interaction and co-localization of Trim28 with Kindlin-2, and Trim28 with March5. Thirdly, March5 ablation elevates Trim28 protein levels by reducing its ubiquitination, while March5 overexpression reduces Trim28 protein levels by increasing its ubiquitination, without affecting Trim28 mRNA expression. Fourthly, Trim28 knockdown increases Kindlin-2 protein levels, and the reduction in Kindlin-2 caused by March5 knockdown can be rescued by Trim28 silencing, and vice versa. Fifthly, Trim28 depletion stabilizes Kindlin-2 protein by reducing its ubiquitination, and the increased ubiquitination of Kindlin-2 due to March5 knockdown can be effectively abolished by Trim28 knockdown, and vice versa. Finally, and most importantly, specific deletion of Trim28 in β-cells greatly improves glucose tolerance in mice by enhancing insulin expression and secretion, and completely reverses the diabetic phenotype observed in March5 cKO mice.",
        "Initially identified as a nuclear protein, Trim28 was primarily recognized as a transcriptional regulator that modulates diverse biological processes through its interactions with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and involvement in histone deacetylation pathways62. Recent studies highlight the role of Trim28 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting the proteasome-dependent degradation of a variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, including p27, AMPK, BCL2A1, etc.37–39. Consistent with this, our study demonstrates that Trim28 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in β-cells, regulating the protein stability of Kindlin-2 without affecting its mRNA expression (Fig. 5m–o and Fig. 6e–g), indicating a post-translational mechanism rather than transcriptional control.",
        "Based on results of our study, we propose a working model elucidating the mechanisms by which March5 and Trim28 regulate β-cell function (Fig. 7o). Specifically, March5 interacts with and ubiquitinates Trim28, thereby accelerating its degradation. In turn, Trim28 interacts with and ubiquitinates Kindlin-2, leading to the degradation of Kindlin-2. Thus, the ubiquitination of Trim28 by March5 leads to the accumulation of Kindlin-2 protein. This increase in Kindlin-2 protein levels stabilizes MafA, a master transcription factor governing insulin expression, ultimately enhancing insulin expression and secretion.",
        "Islet transplantation represents an established therapeutic approach for patients with diabetes characterized by impaired β-cell function and absolute insulin deficiency. However, the functionality of transplanted islet grafts diminishes over time, necessitating strategies to enhance β-cell function and improve long-term outcomes. Our study demonstrates that augmenting March5 or inhibiting Trim28 expression significantly enhances glucose homeostasis and improves outcomes post-islet transplantation. Specifically, islets with March5 overexpression or Trim28 knockdown in β-cells greatly improve glucose tolerance in STZ-induced diabetic mice compared to control islets. Furthermore, MARCH5 overexpression or TRIM28 inhibition in islets from human donors substantially enhances β-cell function, as evidenced by greatly increased insulin expression and secretion. These findings indicate that manipulating MARCH5 or TRIM28 expression in β-cells may offer therapeutic opportunities for diabetes through islet transplantation by addressing insulin deficiency.",
        "In this study, we primarily employed mouse models utilizing the Ins2-Cre transgene, also known as RIP-Cre, which is widely used to achieve β-cell-specific gene deletion or overexpression45. Although Ins2-Cre is considered β-cell–selective, previous studies have reported ectopic expression in the hypothalamus61, a key center for regulating feeding and satiety. To address the potential confounding effects of hypothalamic Ins2-Cre activity on metabolic phenotypes, we conducted whole-brain WB and qPCR analyses. These assays reveal no significant differences in March5 protein or mRNA expression between β-cell-specific March5 knockout mice and controls (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b), nor in Trim28 expression between β-cell-specific Trim28 knockout mice and their respective controls (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). However, given that whole-brain lysates may dilute region-specific alterations, subtle changes in the hypothalamus cannot be entirely ruled out. To further exclude hypothalamic contributions, we assessed feeding behavior. Food intake measurements demonstrate no significant differences between β-cell-specific knockout mice and controls (Supplementary Fig. 11). Collectively, these data suggest that while minimal Ins2-Cre activity in the hypothalamus may occur, it is unlikely to confound the β-cell-specific phenotypes observed in this study.",
        "We acknowledge that there are certain limitations to our study. One important limitation is that the therapeutic efficacy of the engineered islets was evaluated exclusively in the STZ-induced diabetic male mouse model. To more comprehensively assess the translational potential of the pathway identified in this study, further investigations employing additional models, such as the STZ-induced diabetic female mouse model and the HFD-induced diabetic mouse model, will be necessary. It is also worth noting that the diabetic phenotype observed in March5 cKO mice appears to be less severe than that reported for Kindlin-2 knockout mice45. In the study by Zhu et al., Kindlin-2 deletion led to a marked reduction in insulin expression and secretion, which is consistent with our findings. However, their study also reported a significant loss of β-cell mass following Kindlin-2 deficiency45. In contrast, our results indicate that neither the deletion nor the overexpression of March5 in β-cells alters β-cell mass. This discrepancy may be due to the residual presence of Kindlin-2 protein following March5 deletion. Alternatively, given that March5 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, it is possible that it also regulates other substrates involved in β-cell mass control. This possibility warrants further investigations in future study.",
        "In conclusion, our study identifies the March5/Trim28/Kindlin-2/MafA axis as critical for preserving islet β-cell function. Targeted overexpression of March5 or inhibition of Trim28 in islet β-cells could enhance β-cell function in male mice and human islets, highlighting it may serve as a promising therapeutic target for diabetes.",
        "Mice with conditional knockout were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 for gene modification. For March5 fl/fl mice, loxP sites were inserted flanking exon 2 (Shanghai Model Organisms Center). For Trim28fl/fl mice, loxP sites were inserted flanking exons 4–17 (Cyagen Biosciences), enabling Cre recombinase-mediated deletion of this essential genomic segment. This strategy allows tissue-specific gene ablation upon Cre recombinase expression. We established β-cell-specific March5 knockout mice by crossing March5 fl/fl mice with Ins2-Cre transgenic mice (RIP-Cre; Jackson laboratory, USA). The offspring with March5 fl/fl; Ins2-Cre (hereafter referred to as cKO) was obtained as β-cell-specific March5 knockout mice. To generate March5 overexpression (March5OE) mice, a CMV-loxp-stop-loxp-March5 construct was inserted into the Rosa26 locus via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting, allowing Cre-dependent tissue-specific expression (Shanghai Model Organisms Center). To achieve inducible deletion of March5 in β-cells of adult mice, we mated March5 fl/fl mice with transgenic Ins1-Cre/ERT mice to obtain March5 fl/fl; Ins1-CreERT. At 2 months of age, these mice received daily intraperitoneal Tamoxifen (Sigma, T5648) injection at 100 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days. We have previously established the Kindlin-2fl/fl mice63. To establish mice with March5 and/or Kindlin-2 haploinsufficiency, Kindlin-2fl/fl mice were mated with March5 fl/fl; Ins2-Cre mice or C57BL/6J mice, yielding genotypes such as March5 fll+; Ins2-Cre mice, Kindlin-2fl/+; Ins2-Cre mice, Kindlin-2fl/+; March5 fll+; Ins2-Cre mice, among others. Similarly, β-cell-specific double knockout mice for March5 and Trim28 (March5 fl/fl; Trim28fl/fl; Ins2-Cre) were generated using the same Cre-loxP approach. To ensure experimental consistency and minimize animal usage, only male mice were utilized for most experiments. To induce a type 2 diabetes (T2D) model, 6-week-old male cKO and control mice were subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% fat calories; Research Diets, D12492) for 14 weeks.",
        "All experimental mouse strains were derived from the C57BL/6J genetic line.

Briefly, we injected 3 mL of ice-cold collagenase V solution (Sigma, C9263, 1 mg/mL in Hanks balanced salt solution [HBSS]) into the pancreas’ common bile duct. Post-injection, the solution was extracted and subjected to digestion at a controlled temperature of 37 °C for a duration of 15 min, while being agitated every 2–3 min. Islets were hand-picked after termination with ice-cold Hanks’ buffer, which supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma, A8806). Then we used RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS along with 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 100 U/mL penicillin as the culture medium for isolated islets. For in vitro GSIS assays, isolated islets were cultured for 1 -h in Krebs buffer with 2.8- or 16.7-mM glucose. Supernatants and islets were then collected, and insulin concentrations in the supernatants were measured using an ELISA kit (EZassay, MS300) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Insulin levels were normalized to total DNA content. For perifusion assays, 30 islets of similar sizes and morphology were loaded into a temperature-controlled perifusion chamber. After a 30-min preincubation period in Krebs buffer with 2.8 mM glucose at 37 °C, we continuously perifused the islets with the same glucose concentration for an additional 5-min. Subsequently, we applied high-glucose stimulus (16.7 mM) glucose to stimulate islets at a flow rate of 200 μL /min flow for half an hour.

    "title": "Impact of Procedure-Related Complications on Long-term Islet Transplantation Outcome. the treatment of type 1 diabetes, but this procedure has met significant challenges over the years. One such challenge is to address why primary graft function still remains inconsistent after islet transplantation. Several variables have been shown to affect graft function, but the impact of procedure-related complications on primary and long-term graft functions has not yet been explored. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with established type 1 diabetes were included in this study. Each patient had two to three intraportal islet infusions to obtain 10,000 islet equivalent (IEQ)/kg in body weight, equaling a total of 68 islet infusions. Islet transplantation consisted of three sequential fresh islet infusions within 3 months. Islet infusions were performed surgically or under ultrasound guidance, depending on patient morphology, availability of the radiology suite, and patient medical history. Prospective assessment of adverse events was recorded and graded using \"Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events in Trials of Adult Pancreatic Islet Transplantation.\" RESULTS: There were no deaths or patients dropouts. Early complications occurred in nine of 68 procedures. beta score 1 month after the last graft and optimal graft function (beta score >/=7) rate were significantly lower in cases of procedure-related complications (P = 0.02, P = 0.03). Procedure-related complications negatively impacted graft function (P = 0.009) and was an independent predictive factor of long-term graft survival (P = 0.033) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Complications occurring during radiologic or surgical intraportal islet transplantation significantly impair primary graft function and graft survival regardless of their severity.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the impact of islet transplantation (IT) on diabetes complications, death, and cancer incidence. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This retrospective, multicenter, cohort study included patients from three IT clinical trials (intervention group) and from the French health insurance claims database Système National des Données de Santé (SNDS) (control group). Two cohorts of IT recipients were analyzed: IT recipients after kidney transplantation (IAK) and IT recipients alone (ITA). They were matched with patients living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) from the SNDS using a propensity score. The primary outcome was a composite criterion including death, dialysis, amputation, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and transient ischemic attack. The secondary outcome was cancer. Hazard ratio (HRs) and P values were obtained using Cox proportional hazards analysis and log-rank test, respectively. RESULTS The study included 61 ITA recipients matched to 610 T1D control patients and 45 IAK recipients matched to 45 T1D control patients over a median follow-up period >10 years. Compared with T1D control patients, ITA and IAK recipients had a lower composite outcome risk (HR 0.39 [95% CI 0.21–0.71; P = 0.002] and 0.52 [0.30–0.88; P = 0.014], respectively) that seemed driven by reduced mortality (0.22 [0.09–0.54]; P < 0.001) for ITA and reduced dialysis (0.19 [0.07–0.50]; P < 0.001) for IAK. Both groups showed no significant changes in cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests long-term benefits of IT on diabetes-related outcomes. Furthermore, despite the use of immunosuppressive drugs following IT, we observed no significant increase in the risk of cancer. Altogether, these findings highlight a favorable risk-benefit ratio of IT in treating patients with unstable T1D.",

        "Despite intensive insulin therapy, people living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) still have a high risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications (1,2). Islet transplantation (IT) is a minimally invasive technique used to improve glycemic control, prevent severe hypoglycemia, improve quality of life, and achieve insulin independence, with the rate of insulin independence varying based on center experience and transplantation strategy (3–5). Based on these results, IT is now considered a therapeutic option for people living with unstable T1D (islet transplantation alone [ITA]) and people living with T1D and functional kidney graft (islet after kidney transplantation [IAK]), especially in European countries (6).",
        "If IT metabolic outcomes are well described, as well as the long-term impacts of IT on recipients’ mortality and diabetes complications or return to dialysis, comparative information with patients not undergoing IT is poorly described. Indeed, when considering mortality among IT recipients, data from the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry (CITR) indicated a 5-year survival probability of 97.7% (7). The Groupe Rhin Rhône Alpes Genève pour la transplantation d'îlots de Langerhans (GRAGIL) group observed a 10-year survival probability of 86.4% (5), while the Edmonton group reported a 20-year survival probability of 75% (8). Recently, a study conducted in Miami, Florida, involving 49 IT recipients demonstrated that IT does not increase mortality related to long-term immunosuppressant use compared with patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) not transplanted (9). However, this conclusion was based on epidemiological data from national diabetes registries spanning different periods without matched patient data. The rate of cancer incidence was 13.6% at 10 years (5) and remained stable at 20 years (8), with a predominance of skin cancers (33%).",
        "Regarding kidney function, the most recent studies (10,11) indicated that following IAK, an initial decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was observed (−10 to −20 mL/min). However, kidney function subsequently recovered and, in the best cases, either continued to improve, remained stable, or showed a decline similar to that seen in healthy individuals (−1 to −2 mL/min/year). Finally, for the benefits of IAK, a few comparative studies are available. In a cohort followed for 3 years, Fiorina and colleagues (12,13) demonstrated an improvement in cardiovascular function and kidney graft survival in the IAK group compared with the kidney-transplanted group without IT. Another recent study focusing on IAK recipients showed that IAK improves patient-graft survival based on a composite end point that associated graft failure with return to dialysis, kidney retransplantation, and death compared with patients with kidney graft and T1D but without IT (14).",
        "Therefore, further investigation is needed to determine the long-term benefits of IT based on overall diabetes-related complications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of IT on diabetes complications such as death, dialysis, amputation, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, return to dialysis for IAK, and immunosuppressive treatment complications such as cancer.",
        "This multicenter cohort study complied with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies (15). The protocol was published online before the study started (Open Science Framework registry, https://osf.io/c25pv/).",
        "The study was conducted from the individualized data of patients from databases built following the previously published GRAGIL trial and Trial Comparing Metabolic Efficiency of Islet Graft to Intensive Insulin Therapy for Type 1 Diabetes’s Treatment (TRIMECO) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00639600, NCT00321256, and NCT01148680) (16–18) and data extracted from the French health insurance claims database Système National des Données de Santé (SNDS). SNDS covers the entire population of France (67 million residents), of which 87% are covered by the national health insurance general scheme. Each person is identified by a unique, anonymous number. Since 2006, SNDS has recorded information on all outpatient care (including drugs, imaging, and laboratory tests) and inpatient care (including medical diagnoses, ICD-10 codes, and procedures performed as coded according to the Common Classification of Medical Procedures). The health expenses for patients with long-term disease, such as cancer, diabetes, and their related complications, are fully reimbursed, and their diagnoses are registered according to ICD-10 coding. SNDS has been extensively used and described, and all codes used for characteristic identification have been previously described (19–21).",
        "Our experimental cohort was composed of two subgroups: a group of all clinical trial patients with a kidney transplant before IT (IAK cohort) and a group of all other clinical trial patients (ITA cohort). The initial sample for the experimental group (i.e., clinical trial patients) consisted of all IT recipients in the GRAGIL trial, TRIMECO with its extension, and Swiss IT recipients (estimated n = 150). However, due to a regulatory issue, we were not able to obtain data from the Swiss IT recipients, so the final experimental cohort was composed of 106 IT recipients with 45 IAK and 61 ITA recipients transplanted between 1999 and 2016.",
        "Our nonexposed cohort was composed of a synthetic control group identified from the SNDS. First, we identified every patient with T1D with at least 5 years of insulin use before inclusion, no reimbursement for oral glucose-lowering drugs, and a follow-up of up to 10 years. As the SNDS includes data from 1 January 2006 through 31 December 2022, we included patients between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012 to ensure a minimum diabetes duration and follow-up. Second, we selected patients >18 years old at the inclusion date. Third, we divided our cohort of patients with T1D into two distinct cohorts: 1) patients with T1D without a kidney transplant and 2) patients with T1D with a kidney transplant. Fourth, we excluded patients with fewer than two hospitalizations for diabetes or diabetes complications in the year preceding inclusion (i.e., proxy for diabetes severity) for the group without kidney transplant. We excluded patients with <3 years between kidney transplant and the inclusion date for the group with kidney transplant. Fifth, to ensure that patients in our control group were not in the experimental group, we excluded every patient with the same sex, birth month, birth year, and death status (dead or alive) on 31 December 2022. A flow diagram of the SNDS patient selection and timeline for the selection of the control group are presented in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2.",
        "Finally, for both cohorts, each patient included in the experimental group was matched using greedy matching on propensity score with a caliper width of 0.2 SDs of the logit at a ratio of up to 1:10 (i.e., 1 experimental group patient matched to 10 synthetic control group patients) for the ITA cohort and 1:1 for the IAK cohort. We constructed the propensity score with conditional logistic regression stratified by an IT set to predict the probability of receiving IT compared with no IT using known and identifiable risk factors for diabetes severity. The covariates used for the propensity score were sex, age, history (in the 5 years prior to the index date) of dialysis, amputation, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and myocardial infarction. Codes used for covariate identification are presented in Supplementary Table 1.",

        "We calculated descriptive summary characteristics for the study population by exposure status for quantitative parameters (mean and SD or median and 25th to 75th percentiles) and qualitative parameters (number and percentage of patients), and normality was graphically assessed. We used standardized mean difference (SMD) instead of the P value to assess whether our matching was efficient because of the large number of patients. An absolute SMD ≤10% indicated a negligible difference in potential confounders and balanced matched cohorts (22). We compared the occurrence of events between groups using a survival analysis (log-rank test). As a sensitivity analysis, we conducted a Cox proportional hazards analysis in both propensity score–matched cohorts (Supplementary Table 3) to assess the robustness of the method. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI for each end point in individuals with IT. Patients with missing data on sociodemographic variables were excluded. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide version 7.13 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), R version 4.2.1 or higher (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), and PASS version 15 (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT).",

        "The experimental group was composed of two distinct populations: a first population of 61 ITA recipients with a median duration of T1D of 31.6 (25th–75th percentile 24.5–39.3) years and a median follow-up after IT of 10.4 (8.7–13.6) years and a second population of 45 IAK recipients with a median duration of T1D of 32.6 (26.9–40.9) years, a median follow-up after IT of 13.4 (8.2–17.4) years, and a median delay between kidney and IT of 3.9 (2.6–6.4) years (kidney transplantation occurred between 1990 and 2011). Detailed anthropometric data and preexisting T1D-related complications (before IT for the experimental group or before inclusion for the control group) are compiled in Table 1. Overall, 61 ITA recipients were matched on propensity score to 610 control patients from the synthetic group, achieving a satisfactory level of global matching (absolute SMD <10%) except for stroke history (SMD −11.4%) in disfavor of the control group (i.e., there were more patients with a history of stroke in the control group). Forty-five IAK recipients were matched on propensity score to 45 control patients, with a median delay between kidney transplantation and inclusion of 3.72 (3.00–4.51) years and a lower matching quality compared with ITA (three absolute SMDs >10% for transient ischemic attack, age, and myocardial infarction [10.8%, 30.2%, and 26.2%, respectively]) in disfavor of the IAK group (i.e., there were more patients with the presence of the characteristic in the intervention group).

It is important to highlight that these positive results for IT were achieved without long-term insulin independence. Indeed, <5% of patients in the GRAGIL trials (5) remained insulin independent 10 years after islet infusion (although 50% had a functional graft), while 59% of patients in TRIMECO (18) remained insulin independent 1 year after islet infusion (with 85% having a functional graft).",
        "Regarding the population of patients undergoing ITA, numerous studies have demonstrated improvements in metabolic parameters (reduction in glycemic variability, decrease in HbA1c levels), prevention of severe hypoglycemia, and enhancement of quality of life (3,4,16–18). Unfortunately, there are limited comparative data on the impact of ITA on serious diabetes-related complications such as death, cardiovascular complications, amputation, and dialysis. Only Lemos et al. (9) reported a trend of no increased risk with ITA compared with historical data from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications and the Allegheny County T1D registry cohort. One of the notable observations from our study was the significant reduction in the composite end point frequency among patients who underwent ITA compared with those who did not. Although the benefit on the composite outcome seemed to be driven by the reduction of mortality, this interpretation should be made with caution due to the limited number of events. Furthermore, our study suggests that there is no significant difference on cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack) and lower-limb amputation associated with IT in ITA population.",
        "Nakamura et al. (23) reported a cancer incidence of 43% (3 of 7) among IT recipients compared with 4% (1 of 26) in patients treated with multiple daily injections of insulin over the same period. The higher cancer prevalence observed in this study (vs. 13% previously published [5,8] and >20% observed in our cohort) can likely be attributed to the small sample size. Moreover, the increased risk reported in this study was observed in nonmatched patients who did not share comparable characteristics. Matching was performed based on age, C-peptide negativity, and baseline creatinine levels but not on the presence of unstable T1D. In our cohort, the absence of a significant increase in the risk of cancer following ITA is a noteworthy finding, considering the use of immunosuppressive regimens previously described (induction with thymoglobulin or interleukin-2 inhibitor and maintenance with calcineurin inhibitor, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, or mycophenolate acid) (16–18). While immunosuppressive treatment is known to carry oncogenic risks, the current study provides reassurance regarding the safety profile of ITA in this regard. It should be noted that the median follow-up period of this cohort of >10 years may not be sufficient to detect certain cancers that emerge years after transplantation but remains compatible with the delay in cancer development reported in the literature. The literature indicates an increased risk of cancer (mostly liver, pancreatic, colorectal, endometrial, and kidney) in mostly patients with type 2 diabetes but also in patients with T1D compared with individuals without diabetes (24,25). Taken together, these studies could suggest that the risk of cancer in patients with diabetes is related to glycemic control (as it is present regardless the types of diabetes). Based on these data, we hypothesize that the better glycemic control offered by ITA (already well demonstrated for patients included in our study [16–18]) may counterbalance the oncogenic risk associated with immunosuppressive treatment used after IT and provide similar oncogenic risk as patients with poorly controlled T1D.",
        "In our study, we observed a significant reduction in the composite end point incidence rate among patients who underwent IAK compared with those with kidney transplant alone. This reduction suggests the potential of IAK to improve long-term outcomes and seems particularly driven by the reduced risk of dialysis (81%). This benefit of IAK on dialysis risk could also be linked to the eligibility criteria for IAK (GFR >50 mL/min) in the experimental group. However, our results are consistent with those of other studies (4,26–28). Several teams have demonstrated stabilization of kidney function at 5 and 10 years after IAK (4,26–28), a positive impact of IT on kidney graft survival (13). Recently, Maanaoui et al. (29) showed a positive impact of IAK on a composite primary end point for patient-graft survival (graft failure with return to dialysis, kidney retransplantation, or death) in 40 IAK recipients with T1D matched on biological and clinical parameters with 80 patients with T1D with kidney transplantation alone. Altogether, these data demonstrate the positive impact of IT of kidney graft function.",
        "Although patients with T1D and kidney transplant received a new immunosuppressive induction at the time of IT, which could increase their oncogenic risk, our study suggests an absence of oncogenic risk in IAK recipients compared with patients with T1D solely transplanted with a kidney. Previous data (30,31) have suggested that the decline in kidney function increases the risk of cancer. IAK is now well known to preserve kidney graft function in selected patients (4,26–28). The absence of oncogenic risk could be linked both to the improvement of glycemic control and the preservation of the kidney graft following IT. However, the data from our study suggest an increased risk of myocardial infarction in the IAK population. This finding contradicts several studies that have demonstrated improvements in cardiovascular function (12) and intima-media thickness (32) and a decrease in coronary calcifications (33). The poorer quality matching of patients between the IAK and control groups, due to a smaller sample size for matching, was done in disfavor of the IAK group for two criteria, age and history of myocardial infarction, which are known risk factors for myocardial infarction (34). This mismatching of patients may therefore contribute to a statistically significant but clinically unverified signal. Nonetheless, special attention should be paid to the evolution of cardiovascular complications for this population of patients.",
        "Automated insulin delivery (AID) therapy is now standard of care for patients living with T1D. One study assessed the effectiveness and safety of a closed-loop hybrid system (Diabeloop Generation 1, DBLG1) in seven patients with highly unstable T1D and potential candidates for IT and showed glycemic stabilization benefits (35). Another study demonstrated the utility of a closed-loop system (Control IQ) in 72 patients selected because of a history of severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness (36). This therapy offers the advantage of avoiding the invasive procedure associated with IT (which now typically involves only minor complications) and the use of immunosuppressants (with data from our study suggesting no increased oncogenic risk, though infection risks and other adverse effects have not been studied). Additionally, the cost is likely lower, as the long-term costs of IT are still under investigation (37). AID therapy could, therefore, serve as a bridge (for patients who accept it) before considering ITA (38). It is important to note that the decision should be made jointly by the patient and physician, weighing the benefits and risks of both therapeutic approaches. Currently, AID data in patients living with T1D and kidney transplant are not available, with IT remaining the most validated option for these patients as they are already receiving immunosuppressive maintenance due to their kidney transplant.",
        "Several limitations in our study should be noted. First, a randomized trial with such a long follow-up was hardly feasible, which is the reason why we opted for an external control design. However, the latter does not guarantee between-group comparability. We have built the control group using a national health care database covering almost the entire French population, which is a strength of this study, but some key variables are missing, including metabolic data, laboratory results (e.g., HbA1c, GFR), and sociodemographic data (e.g., BMI, tobacco consumption, exercise). Moreover, although a better cancer classification would have been invaluable information, notably for skin cancers, there is no specific cancer identification algorithm validated in the SNDS to date. Therefore, we decided to reproduce what was already done and studied in the literature (i.e., breast, colorectal, pulmonary, and prostate cancers) and classified other cancers as “other.” As we could not better classify cancer type in the control group, we applied the same classification in the experimental group to avoid a possible misclassification. We partially addressed this limitation with the use of proxies to approximate these missing variables (e.g., two hospitalizations for diabetes complications in the year prior to inclusion as a proxy of unstable diabetes). With the emergence of several T1D cohorts, access to metabolic data could provide a new, comprehensive understanding of patient outcomes.",
        "Second, dates of inclusion and follow-up times were not identical between the two groups as the SNDS starting point was 2006 and the first patient included in the intervention group was in 1999. As best we could, we restricted our control group to have contemporary patients with a sufficient history of diabetes (5 years) and at least 10 years of follow-up (i.e., inclusion between 2011 and 2012). However, with the median duration of diabetes in the intervention group was 31.6 (ITA) and 32.6 (IAK) years, we can assume that the intervention group patients were probably in a more advanced diabetes stage than the control patients, which might underestimate the observed IT effect. Similarly, for the IAK analysis, the matching was not optimal (as shown by large SMDs) and led to imbalance of prognostic factors between groups, which seemed in favor of the control group and, thus, potentially underestimated the observed benefit of IT.",
        "Third, the study cohorts were small, with <100 patients in experimental groups. Thus, the number of observed events were low, and we cannot exclude a lack of power to detect an excess risk of cancer. Moreover, even with a low statistical power, we were able to identify a significantly lower risk of the primary composite outcome, which strengthens the hypothesis of a genuinely favorable benefit of IT on the risk of diabetes complications or mortality. In the present situation, use of a synthetic control group permitted us to compare the patients who received an IT during clinical trials with patients with T1D with ongoing insulin therapy, the main strength of which is the possibility of matching patients on several risk factors to include and compare them as close as possible on known and measurable risk factors (39). Nevertheless, like every observational study, use of an external control group is subject to biases and unmeasurable residual confounding on every factor, a limit largely discussed before (39).",
        "Fourth, we did not match patients on their cancer history due to a lack of available data; thus, we recommend cautious interpretation of the secondary outcome results. Moreover, in the experimental group, patients with a history of neoplasia in the previous 5 years could not be included, whereas we did not have this exclusion criterion in the control group, possibly selecting patients at higher risk of relapse in the control group. The absence of an excess risk of cancer, although statistically significant, needs to be assessed more thoroughly in a study that considers matching on this criterion. Another common complication of immunosuppressive treatments is the risk of infection. We could not study this due to the lack of a validated algorithm to obtain comprehensive data in the SNDS. Moreover, the absence of accurate data on the day-to-day immunosuppressive regimen in the SNDS made it difficult to draw any conclusions at this stage. Therefore, this study does not provide insight into this type of complication and would necessitate further investigation.",
        "Finally, all patients in the experimental group (IT) were transplanted as part of clinical trials, with strict inclusion/exclusion criteria (i.e., neoplasia history, basal GFR, HLA hyperimmunization) and close monitoring. Now that this therapy is part of standard care, it would be valuable to investigate whether real-world data from newly transplanted patients confirm these findings.",
        "In conclusion, this externally controlled study suggests a long-term benefit of ITA and IAK on a composite outcome of death, cardiovascular complications, or dialysis, with no significant increase in the risk of cancer despite the use of immunosuppressive drugs. Despite the inherent challenges and limitations, the insights gleaned from this study contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the positive impact of IT on long-term patient outcomes. Moving forward, continued research efforts are warranted to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed outcomes and to optimize the therapeutic approach for patients with T1D and unstable glucose control.",

In contrast to conventional insulin treatment, replacement of a patient's islets of Langerhans either by pancreas organ transplantation of by isolated islet transplantation is the only treatment to achieve a constant normoglycemic state and avoiding hypoglycemic episodes, a typical adverse event of multiple daily insulin injections. However, the expense of this benefit is still the need for immunosuppressive treatment of the recipient with all its potential risks. Islet cell transplantation offers the advantage of being performed as a minimally invasive procedure, in which islets can be perfused percutaneously into the liver via the portal vein. As of June 2003, 705 pancreatic islet transplants worldwide have been reported to the International Islet Transplant Registry (ITR) at our Third Medical Department, University of Giessen/Germany. Data analysis shows at 1 year after adult islet transplantation a patient survival rate of 97%, a functioning islet graft in 54% of the cases, whereas insulin independence was meanwhile achieved in 20% of the cases. However, using a novel protocol established by the Edmonton Center/Canada, the insulin independence rates have improved significantly reaching meanwhile a 50-80% level. Finally, the concept of islet cell or stem cell transplantation is most attractive since it offers many perspectives: islet cell availability could become unlimited and islet or stem cells my be transplanted without life-long immunosuppressive treatment of the recipient, just to mention 2 of them.

      "title": "Goettingen Minipigs (GMP): Comparison of Two Different Models for Inducing Diabetes",
      "abstract": "Purpose Preclinical experiments on large animals are indispensable for evaluating the effectiveness of diabetes therapies. Miniature swine are well suited for such studies due to their physiological and pathophysiological responses. Methods We compare two methods for inducing diabetes in Goettingen minipigs (GMP), in five with the beta cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ) and in five other GMP by total pancreatectomy (PE). Glucose homeostasis was assessed with the intravenous glucose-tolerance test (IVGTT) and continual monitoring of interstitial glucose levels. At conclusion of the observation period, the pancreata were examined histologically. Three non-diabetic GMP served as control group. Results The IVGTT revealed markedly diabetic profiles in both GMP groups. STZ-GMP were found to harbor residual C-peptides and scattered insulin-positive cells in the pancreas. PE-GMP survived the total pancreatectomy only with intensive postoperative care. Conclusions Although both methods reliably induced diabetes in GMP, the PE-GMP clearly had more health problems and required a greater expenditure of time and resources.

        "Neither the physiology of glucose metabolism [1,2] nor the pathophysiologies of types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus [3-8] are fully understood. Among the promising methods for treating type 1 diabetes is the transplantation of isolated microencapsulated islets of Langerhans [9,10]; metabolic surgery is one of the recently introduced treatment options for type 2 diabetes [11,12]. Many open questions regarding experimental diabetes treatment modalities have been answered in studies using small animal diabetes models. Such studies, for example, have answered fundamental questions regarding the appropriate transplantation site for islets cells [13,14], the function of islets cell transplants in vivo [15,16], the recipient immune response to islets cell transplants [17], and regarding postoperative glucose homeostasis in the field of diabetes metabolism research [18]. As valuable as such studies are, however, questions regarding the feasibility of such concepts under preclinical conditions can only be answered in large animal models of diabetes.",
        "Although non-human primates are ideally suited for such studies due to their genetic and physiological proximity to humans, ethical considerations and the personnel required and the high associated costs have limited primate studies to a very minimum. For training in the course of transplantation the minipig is a serious alternative because of its physiological resemblance to humans, but also due to its size, ease of handling, and the much lower costs entailed. Because spontaneous diabetes is unknown in swine, the diabetes must be induced. The present study compares two different diabetes models in Goettingen minipigs (GMP), one model inducing diabetes chemically with the beta cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ), the other inducing diabetes surgically by total pancreatectomy (PE).",
        "Both variants have already been described in the literature [19-22]. The results with STZ are largely uniform: the severity of the induced diabetes depends on the STZ dosage. The results with PE are less consistent. Postoperative survival of the animals has been reported as less than 10 days, which would disqualify PE as a diabetes-induction method. But several reports describe diabetic swine and canines that have undergone PE followed by transplantation of islets of Langerhans and remained free of postoperative complications during a long term survival of several months [23,24]. The present study evaluates and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two models for diabetes induction in GMP. The findings will be used to establish an optimal large animal model for research into specific questions of diabetes therapy.",
        "Ten 11 to 17-month-old female GMP weighing 20-35 kg were studied. The GMP were housed individually under standardized conditions (19-23°C; 40-70% relative humidity; 12:12 hour day/night cycle); they were fed once daily with a standard swine feed (Altromin; Lage, Germany); water was provided ad libitum. All experiments were approved in advance by the government of Lower Franconia.",
        "In 5 GMP, 150 mg/kg body weight (bw) of the beta cell toxin STZ (Sigma-Chemie, Munich, Germany) were infused via a central venous catheter over 10 min (buffered solution: 1 g STZ in 10 mL sodium citrate buffer freshly prepared). To avoid hypoglycemia due to insulin release by the destroyed beta cells, 200 mL 5% glucose solution were given over one hour after STZ application. The observation time in this group was 3-4 months.",
        "Five GMP underwent total pancreatectomy under general anesthesia. After transverse upper abdominal laparotomy, the pancreas tail was carefully detached from the surrounding tissue. Small vessels originating in the spleen and the V. portae were ligated and cut. The spleen was always left intact. Next the corpus and caput were detached from the surrounding tissue while sparing the pancreaticoduodenal vessels and the vessels supplying the duodenum. Lastly the pancreatic duct was exposed, double ligated and cut. The abdomen was closed and once the anesthetic wore off the animal was returned to its pen where it received intensive medical care. Over the next 5 days the PE-GMP were given analgesia with 1 g Novalgin® (Aventis Pharma; Frankfurt am Main, Germany) and 3 × 50 mg Tramal® (Ratiopharm; Ulm, Germany) daily. Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy was also administered with Tazobac® EF4 g/0.5 g (Wyeth Pharma GmbH; Muenster, Germany). When feeding was begun on the 6th to 8th postoperative day, the GMP received an exogenous pancreas enzyme (Creon® 25,000 IE/Tag) (Solvay Arzneimittel; Hanover, Germany) at every feeding. The observation time for this group was 28 days.",
        "The CGMS® (Medtronic MiniMed; Northridge, USA) continuous glucose monitoring system was used as described by us previously [25].",
        "All blood sugar readings were done on capillary blood from the ears. The first drop was discarded; the second was placed on a test strip of the Ascensia Contour® blood glucose monitoring system (Bayer Health Care; Mishawaka, USA).",
        "The intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed between the 20th and 28th days after diabetes induction. The values of the diabetic GMP were compared with those of the normoglycemic control GMP. Feeding and insulin treatment were discontinued 12-16 h before IVGTT was performed. At time point t = 0 0.5 g/kg bw glucose was injected. At time points t = -20 min; -10; 0; +1; +3; +5; +7; +10; +20; +30; +40; and +60 min blood samples were taken and the serum insulin and C-peptide levels measured. At the same time blood glucose levels were determined. For the subsequent hyperglycemic clamp in normoglycemic animals, 0.6 g glucose pro kg bw were given at t = +60 min to raise the blood glucose level above 500 mg/dL, followed by continuous glucose infusion (2 g/kg bw/hour) to maintain blood glucose levels at over 500 mg/dL till t = +100 min, then the infusion was stopped. At t = +90 min 67 mg arginine/kg bw was administered. Blood samples for monitoring insulin and C-peptide as well as blood glucose values were taken at time points t = +60 min, +61, +63, +65, +67, +70, +80, +90, +91, +93, +95, +97, +100 and +110 min. In diabetic GMP there was no renewed application of glucose solution or continuous glucose infusion. Arginine was given at t = +60 min. Blood glucose levels were measured and blood samples taken at t = +60 min, +61, +63, +65, +67, +70, +80 and +90 min.",
        "C-peptide was determined in GMP serum samples using the RIA-Kit (PCP-22K, Linco Research; Missouri, USA). The resulting radioactivity was measured with a Gamma counter (Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany) in counts per minute (cpm). C-peptide in ng/mL was calculated using a standard curve.",
        "Serum insulin levels were measured with a commercial ELISA-Kit (Biosource; Nivelles, Belgium). The samples were analyzed at two wavelengths (450 nm and 490 nm) against a reference filter (650 nm) with the aid of an ELISA reader (Thermo Max Microplate Reader, MWG Biotech; Ebersberg, Germany). Insulin levels were measured on a standard curve and shown in μU/mL.",
        "At conclusion of the observation time, the pancreata of the STZ-GMP were removed and 1 cm3 tissue blocks from the head, corpus and tail were cryoconserved in liquid nitrogen. Sections from the different sites of the pancreas were prepared from these blocks. The sections were stained with standard hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and for standard immunohistochemistry with an antiinsulin antibody (Guinea pig-anti-swine antiserum; Dako; Hamburg, Germany).",

        "Continuous interstitial glucose monitoring and glucose tolerance tests were performed in 3 adult, 11 to 17-month-old female non-diabetic GMP weighing 20 to 35 kg.",
        "RTGM, a system developed to monitor glucose levels in human diabetics, had been successfully used on GMP by our group [25]. We applied it in two further GMP models. The data in Figure 1 confirms the prior result in one of the two GMP models. The range of values measurable by RTGM is 40 mg/dL to 400 mg/dL. Figure 1 shows that interstitial glucose levels in both the fasting (< 70 mg/dL) and postprandial (< 100 mg/dL) non-diabetic control GMP were lower than in non-diabetic humans (range: 80-120 mg/dL). After feeding, interstitial glucose levels in blood rose as expected. In the fasting phase interstitial glucose levels sank temporarily to the lower measurement limit of 40 mg/dL; it can be speculated that the true value was even lower. The four measurements of blood glucose levels obtained manually by skin puncture accorded well with those of the RTGM.",

        "Figure 2 shows blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels in serum of the non-diabetic GMP controls before and after intravenous stimulation with glucose. All blood glucose tests were performed exclusively as single measurements. After glucose injection (0.5 g/kg bw) at t = 0 with a starting value of 50 mg/dL, blood glucose levels rose sharply, again attaining almost normoglycemic values with 120 mg/dL at t = +60 min. Within 10 min after glucose injection, C-peptide values increased twofold and remained constant at the higher level. Insulin rose fivefold within 5 min and also remained continuously high. During the ensuing hyperglycemic clamp, continuous application of glucose (initial glucose bolus of 0.6 g/kg followed by glucose infusion of 2 g/kg/h), release of insulin and C-peptide rose again and leveled off at constant values after 10 min. The arginine bolus (67 mg/kg) given at t = +90 min led to peak insulin and/or C-peptide release independent of glucose.",

        "Like humans, the GMP were considered to be diabetic if they had a fasting blood glucose level of > 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or a spontaneous blood glucose level of > 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). C-peptide values after stimulation with glucose did not exceed > 0.4 ng/mL.",
        "In 5 GMP diabetes was induced with freshly prepared STZ (150 mg/kg body weight). All 5 STZ-GMP became diabetic within 24 h after application of STZ. All STZ-GMP survived STZ application and remained diabetic over the entire observation period of 3 months. Blood glucose-adapted insulin therapy was tested in these animals (see below). Figure 3 shows the IVGTT in 3/5 STZ-GMP. Their blood glucose levels rose rapidly after intravenous glucose application from the diabetic starting levels (180 mg/dL) to 600 mg/dL and declined slowly thereafter as expected; only falling to > 350 mg/dL after 60 min. C-peptide values in serum remained constantly under 0.4 ng/mL over the entire period. With the hyperglycemic clamp (from t = +60 min to t = +80 min) the injection of arginine (67 mg/kg) should have induced release of residual insulin, but blood glucose levels showed no appreciable change, although C-peptide rose temporarily to 0.4 ng/mL.",

        "At conclusion of the observation time the pancreata of the STZ-GMP were explanted and examined histologically. The pancreata no longer contained intact islets of Langerhans as in the normoglycemic control animals.

        "Diabetes was induced in 5 GMP by total pancreatectomy. All PE-GMP survived the surgical procedure and became diabetic immediately postoperative. Two of the 5 PE-GMP, however, developed an ileus within 4-6 days postoperative and were removed from the study. Learning from this experience, we developed a more intensive postoperative care protocol for the remaining 3/5 PE-GMP: from day +1 to day +14, the remaining 3 PE-GMP were given 1 L sterofundin per infusionem, 2 g Novalgin and 20 mg Paspertin daily. Each animal was checked several times daily regarding general health, vitality, blood glucose levels, and gut noises. The following steps were also taken: Insulin and a 40% glucose solution (details below) were given daily, both in dependence on blood glucose levels, potassium (40 mval/d), Neostigmin (0.5 mg/d beginning on day +3 until start of intestinal activity), Tramal (0.7 mg/kg), and the antibiotic Tazobactam 2 × 4.5 g). The PE-GMP also received daily exercise therapy to improve their general health and vitality. A pancreas enzyme (Creon 25.000) was mixed with their dry feed. Under this intensive regimen the PE-GMP began to eat solid feed on their own on the 4th to 7th day postoperative and began to pass stool on the 6th to 8th postoperative day. Within 20 days after total pancreatectomy the PE-GMP exhibited good general health, moved about freely with no complications. In the ensuing time they were given daily exogenous insulin and exogenous pancreas enzyme. Under this protocol the PE-GMP survived without complications until the end of the observation period.",
        "Figure 5 shows the IVGTT in the 3 PE-GMP. The blood glucose immediately rose from high starting values to > 600 mg/dL, and then fell only slightly over the next 60 min to about 450 mg/dL.

        "The weight of the non-diabetic GMP controls remained constant over a period of 24 days, but the diabetic GMP experienced significant weight loss.

After feeding interstitial glucose levels rose sharply and reached the upper limit of the meter at 400 mg/dL, although they may well have been higher. Following application of insulin, interstitial glucose levels fell as expected in proportion to the dose given.",

        "In dependence on morning (fasting) blood glucose levels, the GMP were fed dry feed containing insulin (Novomix) consisting of 30% insulin-aspart and 70% intermediary insulin). In the evening (without determining blood glucose levels), they were given the long-acting insulin Lantus, the dose depending on body weight. Following this regimen, the diabetic GMP were maintained without complications at blood glucose levels between 200 and 400 mg/dL over several months. Hypoglycemia was not observed under this protocol.",
        "The total costs in personnel and time for feeding, housing and caring for the two groups of GMP and to induce diabetes in them are shown in Table 1. STZ-GMP incurred less overall costs than PE-GMP. STZ-GMP were cared for beginning on day +1 by a specially trained animal keeper. In contrast, in the first 14 days postoperative the PE-GMP received daily care from a physician experienced in handling postoperative complications associated with total pancreatectomy. Only after day +14 when the PE-GMP attained stable good general health was their daily medical care taken over by an experience animal keeper.",

        "Abbreviations: STZ: streptozotocin; PE: pancreas explantation in the animal operation theatre (surgical removal of the organ).",
        "The present study shows that both the STZ-GMP and PE-GMP models of diabetes induction produced diabetic GMP. The RTGM and IVGTT test procedures reliably measured the diabetic metabolism of the GMP.",
        "All GMP treated with STZ became diabetic within 24 hours; this confirms the data in the literature regarding diabetes induction in GMP using STZ [20]. With regard to diabetes induction using total pancreatectomy and the contradictory data in the literature the following can be said: a) none of our PE-GMP would have survived the procedure without intensive postoperative care, and b) only the intensive drug regimen including insulin application ensured the long-term survival of the PE-GMP - in our animals for 28 days. Due to the total absence of endogenous insulin the application of exogenous insulin seems to be a critical point to ensure long term survival in PE-GMP when compared to the literature [22]. In our experience both diabetes-induction methods are suited for long-term studies. Before beginning such a study researchers should intensively discuss the pros and cons of each model: The PE-GMP model ensures that no endogenous insulin or C-peptide will be produced since the cells that release them are surgically removed, a very important advantage for evaluation of the usually still marginal transplant function. In discussing the drawbacks of the PE-GMP model, a distinction must be made between the surgical procedure, postoperative care and physiology. Regarding the surgical procedure, it entails a great expenditure in time, technical resources and personnel, and is therefore very expensive. It requires a surgical team experienced in total pancreatectomy. The postoperative care is time intensive and involves tasks that must be performed several times daily until the animal has fully recovered from surgery. The STZ-GMP model, in contrast, can be produced relatively easily at low cost and the critical phase of intensive medical care rapidly gives way to the phase of routine care.",
        "Physiologically the main scientific advantage of the PE-GMP model, namely the complete elimination of host insulin production, also entails considerable drawbacks: Here again a distinction must be made between surgery-related problems and physiological factors. Regarding the former the following can be said: The massive surgical intervention severely compromises the homeostasis of the organism so that the diabetic GMP has major problems with wound healing and is slow to recuperate other bodily functions. Physiologically disadvantageous are the lack of both the anti-insulin hormone glucagon and the exocrine pancreas enzymes essential for digestion. STZ-GMP offer the advantage of ease of diabetes induction (application of central venous catheter) and no prolonged postoperative recuperation phase. Injection of STZ selectively destroys beta cells, leaving the glucagon producing alpha cells intact and thus lessening the risk of hypoglycemia. The exocrine pancreas function also remains intact, and feeding and digestion proceed without complications. The drawback of the STZ-GMP model is the incomplete destruction of beta cells, as confirmed in the present study by the histological detection of residual beta cells and the STZ-GMPs' partial response to a glucose and arginine bolus in IVGTT. For transplantation of islets of Langerhans, therefore, especially if there is inadequate transplant volume, the PE-GMP model is the superior recipient model. For research in the field of metabolic surgery (such as gastric bypass) the STZ-GMS model is better. The goals of metabolic surgery for improvement of glucose homeostasis are to change the incretin glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide so as to slow the passage of food and to improve insulin release and/or stimulate the generation of beta cells. These goals would be thwarted by prior abdominal surgery for removal of the pancreas.",
        "The continual weight loss in diabetic GMP can be explained by impaired glucose tolerance and is also seen in type 1 diabetics. The clearly greater weight loss in PE-GMP can be attributed to the severity of the surgical intervention and the postoperative drop in food consumption. The control GMP did not gain weight during the observation period, which was expected since they were fully grown adults.",
        "The IVGTT we used with subsequent hyperglycemic clamp is a generally accepted procedure for verification of diabetic disorders [26]. We too could show that this test for monitoring blood glucose, C-peptide and insulin levels can reliably identify diabetes in GMP. The various data however must always be regarded in relation to one another. A simple rise in glucose tolerance above the diabetic threshold is not diagnostic. Independent of C-peptide levels, residual function of the endocrine pancreas may be at play. Unlike blood glucose and C-peptide values, insulin levels in the diabetic GMP lay below the measurement threshold of the methods we used (ELISA). In non-diabetic GMP, by contrast, insulin showed a course comparable to that of C-peptide in IVGTT.",
        "The RTGM we used is a system developed for the diagnosis and control of diabetes. To our knowledge, its use in swine has only been reported by us [25]; the present data confirm and add to our previous results. Once again only measurements are used where the correlation of interstitial glucose and serum glucose levels was > 90%. The data obtained with RTGM permit two conclusions: 1) RTGM can be successfully applied preclinically in swine as shown in the correlation between our RTGM measurements and the event -- feeding or insulin injection -- influencing glucose homeostasis. 2) RTGM measurements mirror the metabolic state and thus provided valuable evidence regarding the organism's current glucose tolerance. An improvement in glucose tolerance with a slight increase in blood glucose levels after feeding, for example, or a rapid postprandial decline in blood glucose levels are made readily apparent over the long-term.",
        "RTGM's ability to measure long-term trends is a basic difference to IVGTT, which allows only relatively brief monitoring for 120 min after glucose bolus. The major drawback to RTGM in swine though is its limited measurement range of 40-400 mg/dL. This range is ideal for human diabetics, since an interstitial glucose level below 40 mg/dL is accompanied by somnolence, if not coma. By nature GMP have lower blood glucose levels than humans, levels which cannot be detected by the device we employed. For future GMP studies a modified RTGM system is urgently needed, one that accommodates the greater natural range of swine.",
        "Both the STZ-GMP and PE-GMP models reliably induce diabetes in GMP and are thus suited for research into specific questions regarding type 1 and type 2 diabetes and/or for preclinical evaluation. To our knowledge we are the first to show that with appropriate postoperative care the PE-GMP can be kept without complications for prolonged periods (week to months), during which, for example, preparations for successful transplantation, e.g. the isolation and in vitro culture of several islets of Langerhans transplants, can be made.",

        "Islet transplantation represents an important therapeutic option for adults with unstable type 1 diabetes (T1D) who, despite their best efforts, have wide and unpredictable fluctuations of glucose levels or who are no longer able to sense hypoglycemia with an increased risk of acute and chronic complications of diabetes and a significant worsening of quality of life (1). The liver is the current site of choice for pancreatic islet transplantation, even though it is far from being ideal because of immunologic (2–4), anatomic (5), and metabolic (6–8) factors leading to significant early graft loss. Along with preexisting and transplant-induced autospecific and allospecific immune responses (9), a nonspecific response, predominantly mediated by innate inflammatory processes related to mechanics and site, plays a major role in the loss of islets and islet function after transplantation in the liver (4,10–13). As reported by many studies, an estimated 60–80% of the transplanted islet mass is lost within hours or days after intrahepatic islet infusion (12,14,15), mainly because of immediate blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (16), thrombosis (11,17), and hepatic tissue ischemia (18,19) with release of liver enzymes (20,21). Furthermore, from a clinical point of view, the process of islet infusion in the liver is associated with an increase of portal pressure proportional to the islet mass (22), thus limiting the total islet mass to be transplanted (23). Recognizing these problems has increased the interest in the search for alternative sites for islet transplantation to avoid liver-specific problems (24). Despite the success of experimental islet transplantation in mouse models using different sites, the results of only a few of those studies were applied in large animal models and none was applied in human models.",
        "Bone marrow (BM) may be an alternative site for pancreatic islet transplantation because it offers a protected and extravascular, although well-vascularized, microenvironment (25). Because of BM broad distribution and easy access, islet infusion in the BM may overcome technical limitations and reduce complications of islet infusion in the liver through the portal vein (24). In a recent preclinical study, we tested whether syngeneic pancreatic islets could engraft in the BM of diabetic mice by comparing survival, function, and morphology of syngeneic islets infused in the BM or in the liver (26). Islets engrafted efficiently in the BM of diabetic mice and for >1 year posttransplantation, the glucose metabolism of those animals was similar to that of nondiabetic mice. Furthermore, mice with islets infused in the BM were more likely to reach euglycemia than mice with islets infused in liver. Islets in the BM showed a compact morphology with a preserved ratio between α-cells and β-cells, with only marginal effects on bone structure. Moreover, the presence of islets in the BM did not affect hematopoietic activity, even when this function was strongly upregulated in response to virus-induced BM aplasia. Based on these results, we were granted approval to use this approach in humans, and we performed a pilot study in which patients with diabetes and hepatic contraindications for liver islet autotransplantation (IAT) received a single intra-BM islet infusion in the iliac crest.",
        "A pilot study to test feasibility and safety of BM as a site for IAT in humans was approved by the Italian Transplant Regulatory Agency (Centro Nazionale Trapianti) and by the Institutional Review Board of the Ospedale San Raffaele in August 2009 (NCT01346098). We were granted permission to perform islet infusion in the BM of the iliac crest in patients with contraindications for intraportal infusion (“second choice”). The Institutional Review Board asked us to follow-up for indications for intra-BM infusion in the same procedures already approved for intraportal infusion and islet isolation, and to perform posttransplantation clinical follow-up. At our center (Pancreatic Unit of the Department of Surgery of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy), IAT is indicated in the following patients: those undergoing pancreatectomy for painful chronic pancreatitis; those with severe complications after pancreatic surgery; those who, during a pancreaticoduodenectomy, have their procedure changed to total pancreatectomy because the pancreatic anastomosis is deemed to be at high risk for leakage (NCT01346098); and those undergoing extensive distal pancreatectomy for benign or borderline neoplasms of the pancreatic body/neck. From August 2009 to April 2011 at our center, we identified 17 IAT candidates. Intra-BM islet infusion was performed in four patients after total pancreatectomy. All patients signed informed consent before enrollment in this study.",
        "Open surgery was performed under general anesthesia. Surgery included total pancreatectomy or complete pancreatectomy. If a tumor was the reason for pancreatic resection, then 1 cm of the pancreatic remnant in the proximity of the pancreatic margin was resected and sent to the pathologist to confirm that margins were not infiltrated. Pancreas remainders were immediately flushed with cold preservation solution (University of Wisconsin) and brought to the islet isolation facility. Islets were isolated and purified according to the automated method described by Ricordi (27), with local modifications. Briefly, the pancreatic duct was catheterized and distended by intraductal infusion of a cold collagenase solution. After digestion at 37°C in a modified Ricordi chamber, islets were purified on a Cobe 2991 using continuous Hanks' balanced salt solution–Ficoll (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) gradient. Purified islet fractions were pooled in final wash (Mediatech Cellgro, Manassas, VA) plus 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 1% glutamine (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), counted, and their numbers were expressed as number of islets normalized to a 150-mm diameter (islet equivalents [IEQ]).",
        "Islets were transferred back to the operating room without time in culture (n = 2) or were infused after being in culture for a maximum of 48 h (n = 2). The intra-BM infusion was performed after the same procedures used for the BM administration of cord blood cells in patients with acute leukemia (28). Briefly, a needle for BM aspiration (14 gauge) was inserted into the left superior-posterior iliac crest under local anesthesia and the islet suspension (1:2.5 ratio of tissue to Ringer’s lactate solution) was infused. The entire injection procedure lasted 8–15 min. All islet preparations used had negative Gram stain results immediately pretransplantation and negative microbial culture results at the time of infusion.",
        "A target glucose level of ∼100 mg/dL using intensive capillary glucose monitoring and continuous regular intravenous infusion of insulin plus intermittent insulin injections was maintained in all patients for at least 5 days. Adverse events (AEs) related to the procedure were recorded and classified according to the terminology criteria for AEs in Trials of Adult Pancreatic Islet Transplantation version 4.1 (16 July 2008) (http://www.isletstudy.org/CITDocs/CIT-TCAE%20V4.pdf). Serious AEs were reviewed by an Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee. Follow-up outpatient visits were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and every year after hospital discharge. We updated medical history and performed a physical examination during each visit. In case of malignancy, adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy was administered when indicated, and computed tomography scan was performed and blood neoplastic markers were measured every 3 or 6 months, according to the risk of recurrence.",
        "β-Cell function was assessed by measuring fasting C-peptide, HbA1c, glycemia, average daily insulin requirement, glucose, C-peptide, and insulin levels during (basal fasting and 10–120 min) an arginine test or a mixed-meal tolerance test. Laboratory and stimulation tests were performed as previously described (29).",
        "We planned to perform BM aspiration and biopsy of both iliac crests (the one infused with islets and the contralateral one) at 1, 3, and 12 months after islet infusion. Histology and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses of BM leukocyte populations were performed as previously reported (30). Histopathological analysis was performed on Bouin solution–fixed, paraffin-embedded BM biopsy specimens. Basic stains included hematoxylin-eosin, Giemsa, and silver impregnation. For immunohistochemistry, the following antibodies were used: cytokeratin 8–18 (5D3 [1:200]; Novocastra, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, U.K.); chromogranin A (LK2H10 [1:600]; Biogenex, San Ramon, CA); CD34 (QBEND/10 [1:100]; Novocastra); insulin (2D11-H5 [1:100]; Novocastra); glucagon (polyclonal Rb [1:50]; Novocastra); somatostatin (polyclonal Rb [1:600]; Novocastra); and pancreatic polypeptide (polyclonal Rb [1:500]; Novocastra). For all antigens the retrieval procedure was performed with ER2 solution (pH 9). Reactions were developed using an automated immunostainer (i6000; Biogenex, San Ramon, CA). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Also, 1–2 mm of the biopsy sample was cut before fixation and preserved in RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Tissue was then disrupted with a homogenizer (Tissue Ruptor; Qiagen) and total RNA was extracted using mirVana Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). We obtained good-quality RNA from all the samples, with a mean yield of 16.2 ± 11.3 μg of total RNA. Reverse-transcription was performed using 5 µg total RNA with SuperScriptIII (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed to study the expression of selected genes with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems). Results were analyzed with RT2 Profiler PCR Array software (Qiagen).",
        "Patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and 30, 90, and 365 days after transplantation using a 1.5-T clinical magnet (Achieva Nova; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). MRI studies included short T1 inversion recovery sequences in the coronal and axial planes to detect possible areas of BM edema, T2-wighted and T1-weighted fast spin echo sequences in the axial and coronal planes, respectively, and a T1-weighted contrast-enhanced dynamic study performed with ultrafast fat-suppressed gradient echo sequences (THRIVE) acquired in the axial plane during intravenous injection of a bolus of gadolinium. Computed tomography was performed 365 days after transplantation.",
        "Four patients with contraindications for liver IAT received an intra-BM islet infusion in the iliac crest. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Patient 1 underwent a complete pancreatectomy 34 days after pancreaticoduodenectomy because of uncontrolled bleeding from the gastroduodenal artery caused by a grade C pancreatic fistula (31). Liver IAT was contraindicated because of portal vein thrombosis. Patients 2, 3, and 4 were initially scheduled for pancreaticoduodenectomy, but the procedure was changed to total pancreatectomy at the time of surgery because the pancreatic anastomosis was deemed to be at high risk for leakage. Liver IAT was contraindicated because of the high risk of complications during percutaneous cannulation of the portal vein in patients 2 and 3, whereas patient 4 had diffuse small liver metastases.",
        "Patient and transplant characteristics",
        "AEs that occurred during hospitalization are reported in Table 1. A total of 21 AEs were recorded; 18 were mild to moderate grade 1–2 AEs, 2 were serious grade 3 AEs, and 1 was grade 5 (death). None of the AEs was related to the islet infusion procedure. A detailed description of the grade 5 AE is provided. Patient 1 was on hemodialysis and underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy because of a mass of the pancreatic head. Massive bleeding from the gastroduodenal artery occurred on day 12 after surgery because of leakage of the pancreatic anastomosis. The bleeding was treated with selective endovascular embolization. The complete pancreatectomy and subsequent IAT were performed 18 days after embolization because of massive bleeding (second instance of bleeding) from the gastroduodenal artery. The patient died of bleeding (third instance of bleeding) on day 4 after IAT. The postmortem examination documented the rupture of the gastroduodenal artery and the event was considered unrelated to the intra-BM islet infusion by the Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee. Patient 2 (pancreatic ductal carcinoma) received adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (cisplatin, epirubicin, capecitabine, and gemcitabine from day 52 to day 227 after IAT) and was alive and disease-free at the latest follow-up (944 days after IAT). Patient 3 (pancreatic ductal carcinoma) received adjuvant radiotherapy (from day 97 to day 145 after IAT) and a postirradiation bowel obstruction developed, requiring surgical intervention (day 599 after IAT). Patient 3 was alive and disease-free at the latest follow-up (843 day after IAT). Patient 4 already had liver metastases at the time of diagnosis (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the Vater ampulla), received adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin, epirubicin, capecitabine, and gemcitabine) and radiotherapy (from day 33 to day 238 after IAT, then from day 279), and died of liver disease progression at day 302 without radiologic evidence of tumor localization in the BM, where islets were infused.",
        "In all recipients, islets engrafted successfully as shown by circulating C-peptide levels after islet transplantation (Fig. 1). Patient 3 gained insulin independence for 1 week after islet infusion but it was subsequently lost. Patients 2, 3, and 4 maintained good metabolic control and had sustained insulin production, although all required exogenous insulin injections during follow-up. At the last metabolic follow-up (mean follow-up, 545 ± 369 days), they had stable HbA1c (7.0 ± 0.7% [53 ± 8 mmol/mol]) while using exogenous insulin treatment (0.37 ± 0.2 IU/kg/day) and showed sustained endogenous insulin secretion (fasting C-peptide, 0.127 ± 0.097 nmol/L; stimulated C-peptide, 0.196 ± 0.057 nmol/L). Moreover, after intravenous arginine stimulation we observed an insulin secretory response, which documented that regulated insulin secretion was restored with islet transplantation in the BM (Supplementary Fig. 1). Because all patients had undergone total pancreatectomy, C-peptide detection unequivocally proves the successful engraftment of pancreatic islets in the BM.",

        "White blood cell, erythrocyte (red blood cells), and platelet counts were not affected by the presence of islet in the BM. Recovery of peripheral blood cells after adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy was efficient and did not differ from what was expected in these conditions. At the last follow-up, white blood cell counts (7.4 ± 1.99 109/L), leukocyte formula (neutrophils, 60 ± 14%; lymphocytes, 30 ± 8%; monocytes, 8.3 ± 0.5%), and platelet counts (230 ± 12 109/L) were within the normal range in all patients. Expected mild anemia associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was present (red blood cells, 4.1 ± 0.2 1012/L).",
        "BM biopsies (both graft-bearing and contralateral iliac crests) and aspirates (contralateral iliac crest only) were planned at 1, 3, and 12 months after IAT. A total of eight biopsies were performed in patients 2, 3, and 4. Moreover, postmortem BM tissue at day 4 after IAT was obtained from patient 1 (Fig. 2). Myeloerythroid ratios, hematopoietic series maturation, lamellar bone, and reticulin fiber content (with the exception of the areas in which pancreatic islet were detected) were within physiological range in all patients at all time points. Overall cellularity showed changes during follow-up (Table 2), with a trend toward slightly hypocellular marrow. This was expected considering that patients 2 and 4 displayed slight maturation defects involving both erythroid and myeloid lineages. Reactive lymphoid aggregates were observed in patient 3. None of these findings was specific of the graft-bearing BM. The morphologic and flow cytometry analyses of the available BM aspirates did not show specific unexpected changes during follow-up (Supplementary Table 1).",

        "The presence of cytokeratin or chromogranin A–positive cell aggregates within the graft-bearing BM was detected by immunohistochemistry in four out of eight biopsies performed (Table 3). Cytokeratin-positive and chromogranin A–positive components were generally surrounded by a stromal reaction that was focal and close to the bone lamellae (Figs. 2 and 3). All four islet cell types, e.g., insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide cells, were present in the BM 1 year after islet infusion (Fig. 3). Moreover, the presence of CD34-positive endothelial cells inside and around the islets was suggestive of islet neovascularization.",

        "Molecular analysis revealed increased expression of genes related to endocrine pancreatic cells in six out of eight biopsy samples (Table 3). In these six cases, the graft-bearing BM showed 8,077-fold, 21,318-fold, and 41-fold increases in insulin, glucagon, and chromogranin A mRNA levels compared with the contralateral BM in the same patient. Moreover, in addition to these markers of endocrine fully differentiated pancreatic cells, we analyzed the expression of transcription factors involved in normal pancreatic development and differentiation. As shown in Fig. 4, the expression of transcription factors of endocrine-committed progenitor cells and mature β-cells, such as Pdx1, Nkx2.2 Nkx6.1, NeuroD/beta2, and Pax6, was higher in the graft-bearing iliac crest BM than in contralateral BM, whereas the expression of transcription factors expressed in early pancreatic precursors and late-stage pancreatic bud precursor cells, such as Ptf1alpha, Onecut, and Ngn3, was not different.",

        "On MRI T2-weighted images, the site of islet infusion at the posterior-superior iliac spine appeared as a small hypointense area inside the normal hyperintense signal of the iliac BM (Fig. 5). This hypointense area did not significantly change over time. One year after islet infusion, bone structure was unaffected by the presence of the infused islets. Moreover, a gadolinium-enhanced MRI perfusion study did not reveal areas of anomalous enhancement surrounding the site of islet infusion. Computed tomography scans showed the presence of small calcified spots at the site of islet infusion.",
        "MRI and computed tomography scan of iliac BM. MRI T2-weighted images acquired 30 and 90 days and 1 year after islet transplantation in patient 3 (left). A small hypointense area (red circle) inside the normal hyperintense signal was evident at the site of the islet infusion at the level of the posterior-superior iliac spine. The gadolinium-enhanced MR perfusion study did not show areas of anomalous enhancement surrounding the site of the islets infusion (right). A computed tomography scan showed the presence of a small calcified spot at the site of islet infusion (lower right).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our article represents the first unequivocal example of successful engraftment of endocrine tissue in BM. Our recent preclinical studies in mice (26) showed that the amount of success and the timing of reverse hyperglycemia were superior after islet infusion in the BM than in the liver. Therefore, we translated our preclinical findings to a proof-of-concept pilot phase 1 study in which four patients with pancreatogenic diabetes and hepatic contraindications for receiving islet transplant in the liver received a single intra-BM islet infusion at the iliac crest. This study has limitations, intrinsic to all phase 1 studies, such as the limited number of patients enrolled, the nonrandomized design, and the absence of a control group. Furthermore, because of the heterogeneity of the pancreatic disease of the patients enrolled in the study, the results cannot be directly compared with those observed with autologous islets transplanted to the liver.",
        "Although conducted with a small number of patients, this pilot experience has generated some important data. First, we were able to document the feasibility and the safety of this approach for islet infusion. The direct islet infusion in the BM was performed according to the same procedure used in our institution for the administration of cord blood cells in patients with acute leukemia (28). The procedure was easy and reproducible and, thus far, we have recorded no AEs related to the islet infusion in the iliac crest. Islets in the BM did not affect hematopoietic activity, even when it was strongly upregulated in response to adjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, bone structure and trabecular compartments were not significantly affected by the presence of the infused islets.",
        "Second, and equally important, we demonstrated the presence of insulin-producing cells in BM biopsy specimens, and this presence was associated with detectable levels of fasting and stimulated circulating C-peptide. This implies that the BM microenvironment is able to support islet revascularization and function, providing an appropriate oxygen tension, a suitable pH, clearance of toxic metabolites, and access to nutrients. Our study unequivocally proves that islets can successfully engraft in the BM, and it provides the rationale for testing the BM as a site for islet infusion in patients with T1D selected to receive allotransplantation of pancreatic islets. A phase 2 trial in which patients with T1D will be randomized to receive islets either in the liver or in the BM is currently ongoing at our institution (NCT01722682). This trial will allow us to assess whether islet infusion in the BM may improve the outcome of an islet transplant infused in the liver, as measured by glycemic control.",
        "Third, we have shown that islet sampling in the BM is highly feasible. Because BM is an easily accessed and well-confined site ideal for serial multiple biopsies, we have the unique opportunity to monitor, over time, different markers of engraftment or survival of islets directly at the site of islet infusion. Although sequential biopsies are often used to monitor acute or chronic events in solid organ transplants, no study in humans has ever attempted to harvest liver biopsy samples and monitor the fate of islets infused via the portal vein. This is because islets are rapidly and randomly scattered throughout the liver after intraportal infusion, and subsequent liver needle biopsies would have limited value because of the low yield of islets in biopsy samples (32). In contrast, this study has shown that islet sampling in BM is feasible and allows the histological and immunohistochemical analyses of the transplanted tissue and surrounding BM and the real-time quantitative PCR analyses of messenger RNAs. Molecular analysis allowed us to detect the presence of endocrine-specific proteins with higher sensitivity than with immunohistochemical analysis, and to search for the expression of transcription factors of pancreas development (33) that may be markers of the proliferation of pancreatic precursor cells. Notably, this monitoring strategy has the potential not only to help our mechanistic understanding of the various harmful events affecting islet graft survival but also to allow the identification of biomarkers for the prompt treatment of such events, hopefully leading to improved islet survival and prolonged insulin-independence of transplant recipients.",
        "Advances in islet transplantation research have led to remarkable improvements in clinical outcomes. During the 2007–2010 period, the reported insulin independence rates were 66% at 1 year, 55% at 2 years, and 44% at 3 years (1). To achieve these results we still need to infuse a large number of islets because almost half of the islets infused in the liver die during or soon after transplantation (12). Since the first report of successful pancreatic islet transplantation to reverse hyperglycemia in diabetic rodents, there has been great interest in identifying the optimal site for implantation. The liver was suggested by Lacy and colleagues (34) based on their experience with a rat model of diabetes, and the first case of insulin independence in a patient with T1D after infusion of islets through the portal vein consecrated the liver as the site of choice for islet transplantation in humans (35). Although the liver remains the most frequently used site, several alternative sites for islet transplantation (pancreas, gastric submucosa, genitourinary tract, muscle, omentum, kidney capsule, anterior eye chamber, testis, and thymus) have been explored in experimental animal models with the goal of improving engraftment and minimizing surgical complications. The results of a few of these studies were translated in large animal models and only rarely in human models (36). However, at this time the ideal site for islet implantation has not yet been identified. The BM has the potential for being an alternative site for islet transplantation because of its protected and extravascular, although well-vascularized, microenvironment. If the results of this pilot study are confirmed by randomized clinical trials, then islet infusion in BM may become an ambulatory procedure of limited invasiveness, well-suited for repeated infusions, with the possibility of performing repeated graft biopsies with a low-risk and simple procedure. Moreover, BM also may be an appropriate site to test, in future trials, the impact of coinjecting islets with cells of putative immunomodulatory capacity, such as T-regulatory cells (37) or mesenchymal stem cells (38), that could help prevent or minimize detrimental autoimmune and alloimmune responses. T-regulatory cells or mesenchymal stem cells would benefit from the close proximity of islet antigens, the target of their tolerogenic function, and from the favorable microenvironment of the BM. The demonstration that pancreatic islets can efficiently engraft in BM holds the potential to revolutionize the field of islet transplantation, thus allowing new lines of research with significant clinical impact on the treatment of diabetes and, more generally, on cell therapy.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 677 islet transplant-alone or islet-after-kidney recipients with type 1 diabetes in the CITR were analyzed for five primary efficacy outcomes and overall safety to identify any differences by early (1999-2002), mid (2003-2006), or recent (2007-2010) transplant era based on annual follow-up to 5 years. RESULTS: Insulin independence at 3 years after transplant improved from 27% in the early era (1999-2002, n = 214) to 37% in the mid (2003-2006, n = 255) and to 44% in the most recent era (2007-2010, n = 208; P = 0.006 for years-by-era; P = 0.01 for era alone). C-peptide >/=0.3 ng/mL, indicative of islet graft function, was retained longer in the most recent era (P < 0.001). Reduction of HbA(1c) and resolution of severe hypoglycemia exhibited enduring long-term effects. Fasting blood glucose stabilization also showed improvements in the most recent era. There were also modest reductions in the occurrence of adverse events. The islet reinfusion rate was lower: 48% by 1 year in 2007-2010 vs. 60-65% in 1999-2006 (P < 0.01). Recipients that ever achieved insulin-independence experienced longer duration of islet graft function (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The CITR shows improvement in primary efficacy and safety outcomes of islet transplantation in recipients who received transplants in 2007-2010 compared with those in 1999-2006, with fewer islet infusions and adverse events per recipient.",

Reduction of HbA 1c and resolution of severe hypoglycemia exhibited enduring long-term effects. Fasting blood glucose stabilization also showed improvements in the most recent era. There were also modest reductions in the occurrence of adverse events. The islet reinfusion rate was lower: 48% by 1 year in 2007–2010 vs. 60–65% in 1999–2006 ( P < 0.01). Recipients that ever achieved insulin-independence experienced longer duration of islet graft function ( P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The CITR shows improvement in primary efficacy and safety outcomes of islet transplantation in recipients who received transplants in 2007–2010 compared with those in 1999–2006, with fewer islet infusions and adverse events per recipient.",

        "Allogeneic islet transplantation offers a minimally invasive option for β-cell replacement in people with type 1 diabetes complicated by recurrent severe hypoglycemia and/or marked glycemic lability. Before 1999, less than 10% of islet transplant recipients achieved insulin independence (1). In 2000, the Edmonton Protocol for islet transplantation achieved insulin independence in seven consecutive participants who received islets from more than one donor under a steroid-free immunosuppression regimen (2). After this proof-of-concept success, islet transplant programs expanded in North America and elsewhere (3). These centers have offered evolving strategies of islet preparation and immunosuppression, although the limited resources available have prevented anything but independent Phase I/II attempts to standardize processes, achieve success, and stabilize outcomes.",
        "Even in the absence of insulin independence, an islet transplant can protect type 1 diabetic recipients from severe hypoglycemic episodes as long as residual islet graft function is maintained, as proven by restoration of C-peptide production (4). Despite this compelling rationale, islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes has produced variable success and elusive durability, has frequently required multiple donor organs, and has balanced one disease load—severe hypoglycemia—with another—long-term immunosuppression. In some countries outside the U.S., islet transplantation has been designated and funded as nonexperimental over the last decade, where the trade-off between severe hypoglycemia and the risks of immunosuppression was felt to be justifiable in carefully selected patients. Islet transplantation remains an experimental procedure in the U.S. and awaits formal results of ongoing Phase III trials to justify biologic licensure and transition to standard of care.",
        "The Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry (CITR) has been established to monitor progress and safety of islet transplantation by using data from the U.S., Canada, and several centers in Europe and Australia supported by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF). The CITR represents the most complete collection of information on islet transplantation in the last decade. The purpose of the present inquiry is to describe trends of primary outcomes and safety profiles of islet transplantation according to cohorts defined by the year of first islet infusion (early: 1999–2002; mid: 2003–2006; or recent: 2007–2010). The analysis comprises allogeneic islet-alone and islet-after-kidney (IAK) transplants performed through 31 December 2010 with data updated through 4 January 2012.",
        "The CITR is the comprehensive islet transplant registry for 27 National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)–funded North American and JDRF-funded European and Australian centers since 1999, comprising 81% of all allogeneic islet transplants conducted as single-arm Phase I/II trials or standard of care. Patients and methods are fully described in previous and current CITR Annual Reports (3), which are publicly available. In brief, recipients of allogeneic islet transplants typically are aged between 18 and 65 years. All have had type 1 diabetes for >5 years, and >95% had documented negative fasting C-peptide (<0.3 ng/mL) and very problematic diabetes control, including hypoglycemia unawareness complicated by episodes of severe hypoglycemia and/or marked glycemic lability characterized by wide swings of blood glucose levels, often with consistently elevated HbA1c levels (>8%). This report includes no cases of islet transplantation after total pancreatectomy.",
        "The Registry collects information on the pancreas donor(s), islet processing and testing, immunosuppression and concomitant medications, severe hypoglycemic episodes, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and C-peptide levels, daily insulin doses, vital status, islet graft dysfunction and loss, reportable adverse events graded 3, 4, and 5 according to the Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events of the Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium (CIT) (5), and serious adverse events (6). Islet recipients enrolled in CIT protocols consenting to have their data shared with the CITR are registered in the CITR and included in the CITR reports.",
        "CIT protocols comprise a series of Phase II and Phase III clinical trials designed to test current immunosuppressive strategies and management practices and pursue licensure for clinical islet transplantation in the U.S. The CIT data are coordinated by the University of Iowa Clinical Trials and Data Management Center, William Clarke, PhD, Director, and are made available to the CITR through collaborative agreements via the common sponsor, the U.S. NIDDK. CITR data are rigorously monitored by the Data Coordinating Center, The EMMES Corporation, Rockville, Maryland, to comply with U.S. Food and Drug Administration Part 21 Code of Federal Regulations requirements. Site participation in the Registry requires local research ethics board approval, strict assurance of patient-identifier confidentiality, and written informed consent by the islet recipients. The CITR Publications and Presentations Committee approved the manuscript.",
        "At preinfusion and at each scheduled follow-up visit, five coprimary end points were assessed by laboratory measurements or clinical evaluations: basal C-peptide (further divided as ≥0.3 vs. <0.3 ng/mL), including reported complete graft loss (defined as fasting C-peptide consistently undetectable with stimulated C-peptide <0.3 ng/mL by local assay without subsequent recovery to ≥0.3 ng/mL or reinfusion, also denoted as “no function”); independence from exogenous insulin for ≥14 consecutive days; HbA1c (further divided as <6.5% and/or a drop by two percentage points or more); fasting blood glucose (further divided as 60–140 vs. <60 or >140 mg/dL); and absence of severe hypoglycemia episodes (requiring assistance of another person). The scheduled times for each infusion were immediately before transplant, 7 days, 1 month, 6 months, and annually thereafter, which was reset at each subsequent infusion. Annual time points from the last of one or more infusions per recipient were used in this analysis. Except for complete graft failure, each of these outcomes can occur, relapse, and then reoccur during follow-up, although with relatively long periods of stable status; hence, they are analyzed as prevalence (percentage) at each follow-up after the last infusion. Complete graft failure cannot remit by definition; therefore, this outcome was analyzed by failure-time techniques. When direct data were missing but graft function was known to have been previously lost and not restored, insulin independence was set as dependent and C-peptide was set at 0. Otherwise, missing data were omitted (i.e., treated as missing at random) in the computations and modeling.",
        "For infusions given the same day from two to three different donors, the donor, procurement, processing, and isolation characteristics were summarized over the multiple donors (e.g., donor ages were averaged, total islet equivalents infused were summed, etc.) The information was summarized again over two to six infusion events per recipient. Trapped (embedded) islets are expressed as a percentage of total islet count in the preparation. Immunosuppression agents were noted as each given or not at each infusion and during the follow-up. Each recipient was classified into induction and maintenance combination categories as indicated in Table 1. All available recipient, donor, islet, and immunosuppression variables were used in the various analyses as possible predictors of the primary outcomes.",
        "Recipient, donor, islet, and immunosuppression characteristics, based on numbers with data",
        "Generalized estimating equations with repeated measures per recipient were used to assess the effect of era (1999–2003, 2003–2006, 2007–2010), follow-up time after the first infusion, and other covariates on the rate (prevalence) of the desirable outcome for each primary end point. A multivariate analysis of all available recipient, donor, islet, and medical management factors on the outcomes was also conducted to see if changes in patient selection and management practices accounted for the observed differences in outcomes over the eras.",
        "The occurrence and outcomes of clinically reportable adverse events (CRAEs), classified as unlikely, probably, or definitely related to the infusion procedure or to the immunosuppression regimen, were analyzed according to era. Each recipient was classified and tabulated according to his or her worst outcome of all infusion-related CRAEs and immunosuppression-related CRAEs during the entire period of infusions and follow-up for the recipient. Comparisons were made with Mantel-Haenszel χ2.",
        "Comparisons across eras clearly were not randomized, and sample sizes were not experimentally determined. In this registry data, nominal P values are reported without prespecified Type I error rates.",
        "This analysis was based on 677 recipients of allogeneic islet transplantation who consented to the reporting of their data to the CITR, with 214 recipients in 1999–2002 (early), 255 in mid-2003–2006, and 208 in 2007–2010 (recent); 423 (62%) came from North America, and 254 (38%) were reported from the European and Australian JDRF sites. Transplants comprised islet alone in 575 (85%) and IAK or simultaneous islet kidney (IAK/SIK) transplant in 102 (15%). The CIT enrolled 46 (7%) in 2008–2010. They received 1,375 islet infusions from 1,502 donors, of which ∼10% were islets from 2 to 3 donors infused on the same day, considered here as “multiple donor infusion.” Approximately 36% of the recipients received only one infusion, 44% received two, 18% received three, 1.3% received four, and one person received six infusions.",
        "The CITR data represent 81% of all islet transplants performed in the North American and JDRF European and Australian centers between 1999 and 2010. The number of new islet allograft recipients doubled yearly between 1999 and 2002 (Fig. 1). A marked decline in activity from 2002 to 2003 reflected a saturation of then-existing protocol enrollments, combined with tempered enthusiasm for the procedure after some centers reported waning insulin independence at 2–3 years (7,8). The number of North American centers performing islet transplants continued to rise through 2005, although the annual number of islet allografts remained less than the 2002 levels. In 2007, there were fewer than half as many North American centers performing islet transplants and one-third of the total number of islet allografts performed compared with 2005 at a time when the commonly used collagenase enzyme Liberase became unavailable. A distinct resurgence in islet transplant activity occurred in 2008 with the available collagenase products and the start-up of the CIT trials.",

        "Figure 1 also shows substantial shifts in immunosuppression strategies implemented during the 12-year period. The early and mideras were dominated by the Edmonton Protocol, which used an interleukin 2 receptor antagonist (e.g., daclizumab) for induction and a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (e.g., sirolimus), together with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI, e.g., tacrolimus) for maintenance immunosuppression. In the most recent era, there has been a shift to induction with a T-cell depleting (TCD) antibody, with or without an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; e.g., etanercept) and maintenance with an mTOR inhibitor or an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor (e.g., mycophenolic acid) combined with a CNI.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the preinfusion recipient characteristics according to era. Over time, recipients with C-peptide ≥0.3 ng/mL have been excluded. Increasingly, recipients have been selected at older age and with longer type 1 diabetes duration, requiring slightly less insulin and having better kidney function, as indicated by lower serum creatinine, suggesting more appropriate patient selection. Consistent with trends in clinical practice, more were using insulin pumps for insulin delivery, which may explain the slightly lower daily insulin requirement, and more were taking lipid-lowering medications. Following national trends, donor weight increased, and consistent with trends in critical care medicine, more donors received insulin with a consequent decrease in donor glucose. Donor HbA1c, when sampled, remained within normal levels in all eras. There were also definite shifts in preservation method and collagenase type, and more islet preparations were cultured. The clinical effects of procurement, processing, and final islet characteristics are the focus of a separate analysis. Recent years have seen a substantial decline in the use of daclizumab, with a substantial rise in polyclonal T-cell–depleting antibodies and/or etanercept, as well as notable declines in sirolimus use, with increased use of mycophenolic acid.",
        "There were increasing levels of missing data with longer follow-up, which is a mixture of data unavailable from the medical record and data still pending entry into the registry. The percentages of missing data for insulin independence were 3% at 1 year, 5% at 3 years, and 7% at 5 years and for other primary end points were 10 to 20% over years 1–3.",
        "Of those who received transplants in the 1999–2002 era, 51% were insulin-independent at 1-year after the first infusion, regardless of reinfusion, and this declined to 36% at 2 years and to 27% at 3 years. By contrast in the 2007–2010 era, 66% were insulin-independent at 1 year, 55% at 2 years, and 44% at 3 years (P = 0.01, Fig. 2A). The decline in the rate of insulin independence during 5 years of follow-up in all eras is significant (P < 0.001). The difference in this decline among the three eras (P = 0.006 for years-by-era) indicates that the rate of decline is less steep, showing notable improvement in durability in the most recent era. Durability of islet graft function, as measured by fasting C-peptide ≥0.3 ng/mL, improved significantly over the eras (P < 0.001, Fig. 2B, left). The rate of graft function loss was significantly reduced if insulin independence was previously achieved, an effect seen in all eras (Fig. 2B, right). Nearly all islet recipients had significant improvements in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose after islet transplantation. The composite end point of HbA1c <6.5% or a drop by two or more percentage points shows improvement from the early era to the mid era (P = 0.03), although no further improvement in the most recent era, with 2–5-year success rates of 50–60% in the recent era (Fig. 2C, left). Fasting blood glucose showed a marked improvement from the early to mid eras (P < 0.01, not shown).",
        "A: Rates of insulin independence after allogeneic islet infusion (islet transplant alone and IAK), annually after last infusion. Left: By era (P = 0.02). Right: By induction immunosuppression category (P < 0.01). B: Durability of graft function (basal C-peptide ≥0.3 ng/mL) after the last infusion, by era (P < 0.001; left). The immediate drop at time 0 is occurrences of primary nonfunction (i.e., C-peptide never ≥0.3 ng/mL). In the most recent era, 95% of those who ever achieved insulin independence (II) retained graft function through 3 years after last infusion compared with 70% for those who never achieved II (P < 0.001; right). C: Percentage of patients with HbA1c <6.5% or drop by two percentage points (P = 0.03; left); and absence of severe hypoglycemic events regardless of complete graft failure (P = NS by era; there were insufficient data from 2007–2010; right). D: The percentage with HbA1c <6.5% or drop by 2% increases with increasing C-peptide level (P < 0.001; left), as does absence of severe hypoglycemic events (P < 0.001; right), annually after the last infusion. (A high-quality color representation of this figure is available in the online issue.)",
        "Severe hypoglycemia was prevalent at first infusion in >90% of all subjects in all eras. Available data on severe hypoglycemic events, regardless of previous graft loss (C-peptide <0.3 ng/mL without recovery), shows >90% remained free of severe hypoglycemic events in all eras, and this relationship persisted through 5 years of follow-up (Fig. 2C, right). Any differences by era on resolution of severe hypoglycemic events were neither detectable nor important relative to this sustained, high level of benefit. If data on severe hypoglycemic events were missing and previous complete graft loss was counted as return to severe hypoglycemic events—an extreme assumption—there was still improvement in 2003–2006 compared with 1999–2002 at years 2–4 (P = 0.03, not shown).",
        "Concurrent C-peptide is a strong correlate of all the other primary outcomes: the higher the C-peptide, the greater the likelihood of HbA1c <6.5% or a drop by two percentage points (P < 0.001; Fig. 2D), the greater the likelihood of absence of severe hypoglycemic events (P < 0.001; Fig. 2D), the greater the likelihood of fasting blood glucose in the 60–140 mg/dL range (P < 0.001, not shown), and the greater the likelihood of insulin independence (P < 0.001, not shown).",
        "A comprehensive model of all predictive factors—noting the shifts in patient age and immunosuppression strategies over the eras (Table 1)—largely accounted for the differences by era in insulin independence (Table 2). The effect of T-cell–depleting agents in conjunction with TNF-α inhibitors shows on enduring insulin independence (9) is confirmed: 50–62% of recipients receiving this induction regimen were insulin-independent at years 3–5 after the last infusion (Fig. 2A, right), compared with 34–43% for those not receiving TCD+TNF-α inhibitors.",
        "Factors predictive of insulin independence after last infusion",
        "Reinfusion is performed when the first graft loses function completely or declining function is proven by declining C-peptide levels. Islet reinfusion has decreased substantially during the 12-year period: 48% of recipients were reinfused by 1 year in 2007–2010 vs. 60–65% in 1999–2006 (P < 0.01).",
        "Mortality is low in this group of type 1 diabetic individuals with substantial disease burden, with stable event rates during the 12-year period (Fig. 3A). The incidence of life-threatening events has declined (P = 0.002; Fig. 3B). The incidence of any CRAE in year 1 declined from 50 to 53% in 1999–2006 and to 38% in 2007–2010 (P = 0.02; Fig. 3C). Peritoneal hemorrhage or gallbladder perforation declined from 5.4% in 1999–2003 to 3.1% in 2007–2010. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declined after islet transplantation (Fig. 3D); however, there are no published comparable follow-up data in similar groups of type 1 diabetes. No primary efficacy or safety end points were associated with recipient or donor sex or ethnicity.",
        "A: Mortality by era (P = 0.49). B: Life-threatening events by era (P = 0.01). C: Incidence of any adverse event (AE) in year 1 of first infusion (P = 0.02 by era). D: CKD-EPI calculated glomerular filtration rate, by era.",
        "In North America, the number of centers performing clinical islet transplants and the total number of islet transplants declined in 2006–2007, with a distinct resurgence in 2008. The reasons for the decline are not directly captured by the Registry but likely reflect changes in the production and availability of the collagenase enzymes used for islet digestion, tempered enthusiasm with respect to long-term clinical outcomes of insulin independence (7,8,10), concern for effect of immunosuppression on kidney function in islet-alone recipients (11,12), concern for risk of sensitization to donor HLA (13–15), and saturation of the referral base for patients with the severest forms of unstable type 1 diabetes. However, with the start of the new CIT protocols in 2008, coupled with more encouraging recent trends in longer-term outcomes with novel protocols using T-cell depletion for induction (16,17), the number of new islet cell recipients has increased annually in the most recent era.",
        "Direct evidence is presented of the importance of durable islet graft function to achieve multiple clinical benefits as a consequent effect. Positive C-peptide is strongly associated with all of the other primary clinical outcomes; hence, the factors that drive positive C-peptide necessarily lead to the other clinical benefits, although additional factors may also contribute to the other benefits. A comprehensive analysis of the effect of all available factors on these primary co-outcomes indicates that older recipient age, lower initial insulin requirement, and the use of T-cell depletion, particularly when given in conjunction with TNF-α inhibitors, are significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes. The numbers are too low to definitively assess the impact of a shift in maintenance immunosuppression, with mycophenolic acid replacing mTOR inhibitors, and both agents are still usually administered in combination with a CNI.",
        "It must be noted that the CITR data have not been accruing in real time; rather, as sites have joined over the 12-year life of the Registry, large portions of the data, including some of the historical data, have been reported during the last 1–3 years. Hence, the current results may vary somewhat from previously published reports, including the CITR Annual Reports. The present data are the most comprehensive and up-to-date information available for the 12-year period 1999–2010.",
        "In the present analysis, the increasing levels of missing data with increasing follow-up time pose some limitation. Strengths of the analysis are the most complete available set of data and ability to track trends during this 12-year period of steroid-free immunosuppression. Stratifying the CITR data by era of transplant shows a compelling trend toward better outcomes in the recent era (P ≤ 0.01), despite the still relatively low total number of islet transplant recipients worldwide. There is an indication of moving toward selection of older recipients with longer-standing diabetes and absence of C-peptide to tip the risk-to-benefit ratio in their favor. The trend toward heavier donors is likely due to donor availability in the midst of a global obesity epidemic and possibly to the known association between higher donor weights and the higher number of islet equivalents isolated (18). This must be balanced against the detrimental effects of transplanting islets derived from donors with unsuspected type 2 diabetes (19), and for this reason, it is important to confirm that the HbA1c of an obese donor is within the normal range before transplantation.",
        "In the past, transplanting islets rapidly after isolation was believed to be optimal. In recent years, the preference toward transplanting islets after a short culture period emphasizes the current supposition that culturing removes the nonviable islets and decreases tissue factor expression that can lead to nonspecific inflammation and islet loss after transplant (20). The percutaneous infusion technique occasionally resulted in intraperitoneal hemorrhage and portal branch vein thrombosis early on; however, these complications have occurred less often in the present era.",
        "Whole pancreas transplantation is an approved option for β-cell replacement in type 1 diabetes, although it is mostly limited to patients simultaneously receiving a kidney transplant for diabetic nephropathy and often excludes older patients and those with coronary artery disease due to the potential for significant surgical morbidity. Thus, islet transplantation may offer a complementary alternative to whole pancreas transplantation in patients who are not candidates for or are unwilling to accept the risks of major surgery, and so some estimation of comparative efficacy is required. In the 2007–2010 era, islet graft survival (C-peptide ≥0.3 ng/mL) of 92% at 1 year and 83% at 3 years (Fig. 2B) compares very favorably with whole pancreas graft survival of 80% at 1 year and 61% at 3 years (21). In the recent era, these graft survival rates translate to an unconditional 44% insulin independence at 3 years (Fig. 2A), the highest long-term islet transplant success rate observed to date. Although this is still short of the 61% insulin independence reported in the most successful cohort of type 1 diabetes pancreas-alone transplant recipients (22), this difference may be explained by the transplantation of 100% of a normal islet β-cell mass with a whole pancreas compared with a variable islet β-cell mass surviving the engraftment of isolated islets and resulting in a reduced β-cell secretory capacity (23). In addition, throughout the 12-year period, these data show an enduring benefit in HbA1c reduction and stabilization of fasting blood glucose.",
        "Importantly, the presence of insulin-dependent islet graft survival defined by C-peptide >0.3 ng/mL confers protection from severe hypoglycemia, and this effect persists even after the islet graft is lost. This declining rate of islet graft loss by era suggests that more recent strategies of immunosuppression, as identified in the multivariate analysis, may better protect islets from alloimmune rejection and recurrent autoimmunity. The successful strategies have all included CNIs that are known to exhibit β-cell toxicity at high doses; however, one study showed modern use of lower-dose, CNI-based immunosuppression resulted in a 100% normal β-cell secretory capacity in whole pancreas transplant recipients (23), supporting that these agents can be used and may even be necessary for successful islet transplantation. Finally, the finding that the rate of graft function loss was significantly reduced when insulin independence was previously achieved suggests that the engraftment of a sufficient islet β-cell mass to eliminate the need for exogenous insulin may mitigate nonimmunologic islet graft loss believed to occur in the setting of increased β-cell demand. Present strategies to improve the proportion of islets surviving engraftment are expected to lead to improved functional outcomes for islet recipients (24).",
        "The CITR shows consistent trends toward improved primary outcomes of islet transplantation in the cohort who received transplants in 2007–2010 compared with those in 1999–2006. Islet transplantation currently offers substantial protection from severe hypoglycemic episodes and high rates of freedom from exogenous insulin requirements in a minimally invasive setting. Emerging innovations in islet production, processing, delivery, and immunosuppressive protection undoubtedly will advance the field. Islet transplantation has already moved from Phase I/II to Phase III evaluation, with the results from the CIT eagerly awaited to provide efficacy and safety information for a standardized approach to islet isolation and immunosuppression management.",
