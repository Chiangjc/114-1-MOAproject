    "title": "Lhx2 specifically expressed in HSCs promotes liver regeneration and inhibits liver fibrosis. represented an attractive strategy for treating liver diseases, with HSCs being crucial to both processes. This study aimed to identify specific targets in HSCs that simultaneously facilitated regeneration and suppressed fibrosis, and elucidated their molecular mechanisms. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Through comparing acute and chronic liver injury mouse models induced by CCl 4 injections, we revealed that HSCs exhibited dual functionality, expressing pro-regenerative and profibrogenic genes following injury. Analyzing RNA-seq data from primary HSCs of these models, along with publicly available single-cell RNA-seq data of HSCs, we identified transcription factor Lhx2, specifically expressed in HSCs, as a potential regulator of the dual functions. Notably, Lhx2 showed significantly higher expression in HSCs from healthy liver tissue compared to fibrotic liver, in both mouse and human models. Lhx2 knockdown impaired liver function recovery and cellular proliferation after acute liver injury. Consistent changes were observed in mice with HSC-specific Lhx2 overexpression. In addition, Lhx2 overexpression not only promoted hepatocyte proliferation but also exhibited an antifibrogenic function after chronic injury. Mechanistically, Lhx2 suppressed multiple functions of activated HSCs, including fibrogenesis, proliferation, and migration, and upregulated SMAD6 to block the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Moreover, Lhx2 was an upstream regulator of various pro-regenerative factors, especially HGF, which is crucial for liver regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that Lhx2 had pro-regenerative and antifibrogenic functions, and elucidated its regulatory mechanism. The study provided a potential target with dual effects for treating liver diseases. Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China. Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.

      "title": "Acetoacetate Ameliorates Hepatic Fibrosis by Targeting Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma to Restore Lipid Droplets in Activated Hepatic Stellate Cells",
      "abstract": "Background: Hepatic fibrosis (HF) is a progressive liver disease characterized by the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and changes in lipid metabolism. Abnormal ketone body (KD) levels, including acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), have been observed in patients with HF, but the mechanisms linking ketone metabolism to fibrosis progression remain unclear. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the role of AcAc in modulating HSCs activation and its potential mechanisms in HF. Methods: We examined the effects of AcAc on HSCs activation by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR both in vivo and in vitro. The impact of AcAc on lipid droplet accumulation in HSCs was assessed using total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and Retinol (RET) kits, along with Nile Red and Oil Red O staining. RT-PCR screening was performed to analyze the expression of genes involved in lipid droplet formation and lipid metabolism. Results: Our findings show that AcAc inhibited HSCs activation by restoring LD levels. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARγ) was identified as a key regulator through gene screening. AcAc primarily regulated PPARγ expression, and knocking down PPARγ significantly aggravated HF progression. Conclusions: The ability of AcAc to restore LD levels and regulate PPARγ suggests that it may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for HF by inhibiting HSCs activation.",

        "Hepatic fibrosis (HF) is a pathological change caused by chronic liver injury leading to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), and its mechanism of occurrence is related to endothelial cell injury, inflammatory immune cell activation, and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation [1]. It plays a crucial role in the progression of chronic liver disease to cirrhosis and eventually to hepatocellular carcinoma [2]. Common etiologic factors include viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, drug toxicity, and autoimmune diseases [3,4]. The pathophysiologic process of HF involves multiple cell types and molecular mechanisms, with HSCs playing a key role in the development of fibrosis [4]. Under normal conditions, HSCs exhibit a quiescent phenotype [5]. When stimulated by hepatic injury and inflammatory responses, HSCs transform from a quiescent to a highly proliferative and contractile myofibroblast phenotype, secreting large amounts of ECM proteins, releasing a series of pro-inflammatory factors (e.g., IL-6, etc.) and pro-fibrotic factors (e.g., TGF-β1) [6], overexpressing α-SMA, fibronectin, collagen and other proteins, which promote the progression of HF [7]. Therefore, activated HSCs have been regarded as a major target for the treatment of HF.",
        "Lipid droplets (LDs), as the main form of intracellular lipid storage, play an important role in the metabolic regulation of HSCs [8]. It was found that the release of LDs containing retinyl esters and triglyceride is a defining feature of HSC activation, and that quiescent HSCs cytoplasm is enriched in vitamin A lipid droplets, which, when activated, have a reduced capacity to store vitamin A, leading to a decrease in lipid droplet content in HSCs [9], and our previous study also demonstrated that inhibition of lipid droplet autophagy ameliorates HF by increasing lipid content in HSCs [10]. Changes in intracellular lipid droplet content are mainly influenced by the conjugation or metabolism of lipid droplets [11]. PPARγ, a key factor in the synthesis of LDs, has been shown to be closely associated with HF, but its molecular mechanism is still unclear [12,13].",
        "As an important metabolic organ, the liver is involved in various material and energy metabolic processes [14]. Therefore, studying the pathogenesis of HF from the perspective of metabolic regulation is expected to provide new drug targets for HF and promote the development of safe and efficient antifibrotic drugs. Ketone body metabolism is a metabolic process carried out exclusively in the mitochondria of hepatocytes, which mainly includes acetoacetate (AcAc), β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and trace amounts of acetone [15]. AcAc is a naturally occurring metabolite produced by the liver that provides cellular energy through conversion to acetyl-CoA. It also involves conversion to other metabolites, including acetone and acetoacetate derivatives, which are ultimately excreted in the urine or exhaled [16]. Dysregulation of ketone body metabolism is closely associated with the development of several diseases [17,18]. A study has shown that targeting 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1 (OXCT1) to regulate ketone body metabolism in macrophages helps to reduce the depletion of CD8+ T cells, which in turn maintains their anti-tumor function and enhances immune responses [17]. In addition, the injection of AcAc was able to prevent the deposition of ECM in HF mice, suggesting that this pathway may play a role in HF; however, the exact mechanism of action is not clear [18]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms of ketone bodies AcAc and BHB in regulating HSCs activation and lipid droplet synthesis to further understand the role of ketone bodies in HF.",
        "Ketone bodies are composed of acetoacetic acid (AcAc), beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), and acetone [15]. Since acetone has a low concentration in the blood and is mainly exhaled rather than directly utilized by cells, its metabolism in vivo is limited and therefore less of a major focus of research. Therefore, the present study focused on the role of AcAc and BHB. In order to investigate the direct effects of AcAc and BHB on hepatic stellate cells, we cultured the HSC cell line LX-2 cells, and LX-2 was treated with AcAc and BHB selected according to the available literature (0–40 mM) for 24 h [19]. The results of MTT assay showed that 2 mM of AcAc and 1 mM of BHB significantly reduced cell viability, and in order to select the concentration of drug treatments more accurately, we further calculated the IC50 values of the two, which were AcAc = 25.24 mM and BHB = 23.51 mM, respectively. Then, in order to rule out the toxicity effect of the drugs on the cells, we chose 1 mM, 2 mM, 5 mM, and 10 mM for the experiments (Figure 1A,B). α-SMA and fibronectin are markers of HSCs activation, and both reflect the progression of HF, which are important biomarkers for assessing HF. Therefore, we further analyzed the mRNA and protein expression of α-SMA and fibronectin by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis after AcAc and BHB treatments, which found that AcAc was able to reduce the expression of α-SMA and fibronectin concentration-dependently, whereas BHB had the opposite effect. The results presented above demonstrated that AcAc significantly inhibited the activation of hematopoietic stem cells, whereas BHB did not exhibit such an effect (Figure 1C–F).",
        "To further verify the consistency of the in vivo and in vitro results, we first induced HF in mice with CCl4 for 4 weeks to establish an HF model. The mice were subsequently injected with AcAc (50 mg/kg) or BHB (50 mg/kg) for 3 weeks while continuing CCl4 induction. The selected doses of 50 mg/kg for both AcAc and BHB were based on a comprehensive evaluation of several factors, including the pharmacokinetics of the drugs, differences in mouse strains, the objectives of the experiment, and safety considerations, as well as previous studies in the literature [19]. H&E, Masson, and Sirius Red staining showed that CCl4-treated mice developed typical HF, which was significantly attenuated by AcAc, whereas BHB did not (Figure 2A). Further serum analysis showed that AcAc had a stronger protective effect against liver injury and HF in vivo (Figure 2B). Subsequently, we extracted proteins from mouse liver tissues and assessed the protein expression of α-SMA and fibronectin (markers of hepatic stellate cells activation) by Western blot analysis. The results showed that AcAc significantly inhibited the expression of HF-related proteins, whereas BHB did not (Figure 2C).",
        "Lipid droplets (LDs) play a crucial role in maintaining the quiescent state of HSCs. Previous studies have shown that the absence of lipid droplets induces HSCs activation, whereas the restoration of lipid droplets facilitates the shift of activated HSCs back to the resting state [10]. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of AcAc on the lipid droplet content of HSCs. As demonstrated by Oil Red O and Nile Red staining, we found that AcAc significantly increased the accumulation of lipid droplets in LX-2 cells (Figure 3A). Similarly, we further examined the lipid droplet content in AcAc-treated cells using total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and Retinol (RET) assay kits, respectively. The results also confirmed that AcAc was able to concentration-dependently increase the levels of the major contents of lipid droplets in LX-2 cells (Figure 3B–D). Lipid droplet metabolism includes the processes of lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid uptake, and lipid droplet autophagy [20]. We queried the key enzymes involved in lipid droplet metabolism processes through a large body of literature, and the roles of acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACACa), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) have extensive validation in lipid synthesis [21], while carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) have been shown to play a role in the oxidation of fatty acids [22]. Fatty acid uptake is accomplished through transporter proteins such as fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) [23], while proteins such as perilipin 2 (PLIN2), Ras-related protein rab-7 (RAB7), and autophagy-related protein 2A (ATG2A) regulate the degradation of lipid droplets through mechanisms associated with autophagy [24,25]. We further investigated the effect of AcAc on key proteins involved in lipid droplet metabolism using RT-qPCR. The results indicated that AcAc had minimal impact on the oxidation and uptake phases of lipid droplets. Interestingly, AcAc significantly affected the expression of PPARγ, a critical gene in lipid droplet formation. Additionally, we observed that AcAc increased the expression of PLIN2, an autophagy-related gene. This increase may be attributed to the dual role of PLIN2: it is involved in intracellular lipid droplet formation through chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) degradation and plays a key regulatory role in lipid droplet stabilization and storage [26] (Figure 3E). Based on these results, we hypothesized that AcAc may promote the recovery of lipid droplets in activated HSCs by upregulating the expression of PPARγ.",
        "To further investigate the effect of AcAc on PPARγ, we examined the protein expression of PPARγ after the AcAc treatment by Western blot analysis and found that AcAc significantly increased the protein expression of PPARγ (Figure 4A). Next, to demonstrate the important role of PPARγ in the inhibition of hepatic stellate cells activation by AcAc, we used LX-2 cells transfected with siPPARγ to investigate whether it directly affected hepatic stellate cells activation. We detected the interference efficiency of PPARγ by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis, respectively, and found that small interfering RNA transfection successfully reduced the mRNA and protein expression of PPARγ in LX-2 cells (Figure 4B,C). Therefore, we further experimented and found that the effects of AcAc on α-SMA and fibronectin were suppressed when PPARγ was interfered (Figure 4D,E). In addition, PPARγ interference also reversed AcAc-induced lipid droplet accumulation, specifically, PPARγ interference significantly reversed the increase in lipid droplet content in AcAc-treated LX-2 cells (Figure 4F) and limited the elevation of TC, TG, and RET levels (Figure 4G–H). This suggests that AcAc affects the formation of lipid droplets and the levels of related metabolites by regulating the expression of PPARγ. The above results suggest that PPARγ is an important target of AcAc to inhibit HSCs activation.",
        "To investigate whether AcAc regulates and attenuates HF through the PPARγ, we used mice for intraperitoneal injection of AcAc (50 mg/kg) for 4 weeks and VA-Lip-shRNA-PPARγ was prepared according to a standard reported method and was administered into CCl4-challenged mice through the tail vein to reduce the expression of PPARγ [27]. Histological analyses by H&E staining, Masson staining, and Sirius Red staining showed that AcAc treatment significantly improved the liver organization and reduced the manifestation of CCl4-induced liver injury and fibrosis. However, when PPARγ was interfered, this protective effect was significantly reversed, and the liver showed renewed damage to its tissue structure and increased fibrosis and inflammation (Figure 5A). Further analysis of the biochemical indices of serum and liver tissue showed that AcAc treatment significantly reduced markers related to HF and liver injury compared with the CCl4-treated group; however, the improvement of these indices was significantly attenuated or completely disappeared after PPARγ interference, suggesting that the interference of PPARγ reversed the anti-fibrotic effect of AcAc (Figure 5B). To further verify the critical role of PPARγ in the anti-fibrotic effect of AcAc, the protein expression related to fibrosis was analyzed by Western blot analysis. The results showed that AcAc was able to significantly down-regulate the expression of fibronectin and α-SMA, while up-regulating the level of PPARγ, suggesting that AcAc inhibited hepatic fibrosis by activating PPARγ. However, under the condition of PPARγ interference, the regulatory effect of AcAc on these proteins was significantly weakened, the levels of fibronectin and α-SMA failed to be effectively decreased, and the up-regulatory effect of PPARγ was not maintained (Figure 5C). Taken together, the above experimental results indicate that PPARγ is a key target of the anti-HF effect of AcAc, and the interference of PPARγ can significantly reverse the protective effect of AcAc in alleviating HF. These data reveal the important role of PPARγ in the regulation of HF by AcAc and provide new perspectives for future therapeutic strategies of HF.",
        "Hepatic stellate cells play a crucial role in the onset and progression of HF [1,28]. HSCs have an important function in the maintenance of homeostasis in the liver, typically storing vitamin A and maintaining their resting state via LDs [28]. In response to liver injury, HSCs are activated and transformed into myofibroblasts that secrete large amounts of collagen and other extracellular matrix components, thereby driving HF [6], thus exploring the mechanisms that inhibit the activation of HSCs is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies for HF.",
        "PPARγ is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, which mainly regulates physiological processes such as lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and inflammatory response [29]. It has been found that PPARγ is not only involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, but also plays a key role in the immune response and fibrotic process in many diseases [30]. In studies of HF, PPARγ has been shown to have the potential to inhibit the activation of HSCs and attenuate HF [12,13]. PPARγ activates the transcription of downstream genes by binding to its ligands, which in turn regulates biological processes such as lipid droplet production, fatty acid metabolism, and autophagy [31], which may have an impact on the activation of HSCs and the development of HF.",
        "In this study, we revealed the critical role of PPARγ in HF by exploring the effects of AcAc on HSCs. Our data showed that the ketone body AcAc significantly inhibited the activation of HSCs and HF, whereas BHB did not show a similar effect. In vitro experiments, AcAc decreased the expression of α-SMA and fibronectin, markers of HSCs activation, in a concentration-dependent manner and promoted the maintenance of HSCs quiescence by increasing the accumulation of LDs. AcAc inhibited HSCs activation by upregulating the expression of PPARγ, which promotes the generation of LDs and affects the levels of related metabolites. Further in vivo experiments demonstrated that AcAc significantly attenuated the manifestation of liver injury and fibrosis in a mouse model of CCl4-induced HF. AcAc suppressed the expression of HF-associated proteins by regulating PPARγ. However, the interference of PPARγ significantly reversed the anti-fibrotic effect of AcAc, suggesting that PPARγ is a key target of the anti-HF effect of AcAc. In summary, AcAc inhibited HSCs activation and HF by activating the PPARγ, and PPARγ interference significantly reversed this effect, suggesting an important role of PPARγ in AcAc regulation of HF. Due to the important role of AcAc in energy metabolism and its short half-life, its degradation does not significantly reduce its effect in inhibiting HSCs activation. This study provides new perspectives for future therapeutic strategies for HF, especially by regulating PPARγ expression.",

Male ICR mice, weighing about 18–22 g, were obtained from Hangzhou Medical College. The environment was controlled with a 12-h light/dark cycle, at 22 °C temperature and 40–60% humidity. Following a 7-day acclimation period, HF was induced via intraperitoneal injection of a CCl4 and olive oil mixture (1:9 v/v; 0.5 mL/100 g). ShRNA of mouse PPARγ (5′-GCCCTGGCAAAGCATTTGTAT-3′) was synthesized by Nanjing Jin Ting biological science and technology (Nanjing, China). VA-Lip refers to liposomes that are bound with vitamin A, which are used for targeted delivery of the compound.

        "Barrier tissues are continuously challenged by environmental stressors and must therefore adapt and establish programs designed to preserve tissue integrity. For example, after sensing damage, the intestinal barrier triggers molecular and cellular programs aimed at promoting tissue repair. To achieve this, intestinal stem cells (ISCs), located at the crypt bottom, engage in dynamic cross-talk with neighbouring cells (the ISC niche) that provides signals modulating ISC functions6–9. Such modulation is critical to the development of ISC-based regenerative therapies for chronic diseases that involve intestinal barrier loss, including inflammatory bowel disease and graft-versus-host disease1,6,10,11. However, excessive regeneration is strongly linked with neoplastic transformation12, therefore limiting therapeutic strategies promoting regeneration without the risk of developing tumours. How ISC and their niche must adapt and trigger regenerative processes after injury while not compromising the final goal of a tumour-free system is unclear.",
        "We hypothesized that pro-regenerative pathways shared between different tissues and injury models might represent a conserved regulatory mechanism to limit tumorigenesis. To identify a gut-regenerative core signature, we compared the transcriptomic landscape of tissue regeneration after irradiation- and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced damage4,5 in the small intestine (SI) and colon with their steady-state transcriptomics signature. KEGG pathway analysis of 245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared between DSS- and irradiation-induced injury models revealed conserved upregulation of cholesterol metabolism in response to damage (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Among the genes defining this term, four genes (Abca1, Apoc3, Apoa1 and Apoa4) (Extended Data Fig. 1a (dashed box)) are known to be transcriptionally regulated by the nuclear receptor LXR13–17—a central regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. Using spatial transcriptomics, we observed a widespread induction of Abca1 transcripts at 3 days post-irradiation (d.p.i.) compared with steady-state conditions (0 d.p.i.) in the SI (Fig. 1a). Using RNA in situ hybridization (RNAscope) analysis of Lgr5 and Abca1, we observed induction of Abca1 transcripts in SI crypts at 3 d.p.i. compared with steady-state conditions (0 d.p.i.) (Fig. 1b), which was confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in regenerating SI crypts after irradiation- and DSS-induced damage (Fig. 1c,d). To assess the functional role of LXR activation in response to damage, we fed wild-type (WT) mice with a diet either supplemented with a synthetic LXR agonist (GW3965) or a control diet (standard) and analysed intestinal tissues after damage (Extended Data Fig. 1b). As expected, the LXR target genes Abca1 and Abcg1 were induced in GW3965-fed mice compared with in standard-diet-fed mice, irrespective of the type of damage or region of the intestine (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We observed increased crypt area and reduced histopathological score in GW3965-fed compared with control-fed mice after irradiation- and DSS-induced damage, respectively (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). To assess whether the observed protective effect was due to reduced damage or enhanced regeneration, we analysed crypt cell death and proliferation, respectively. By 1 d.p.i., we observed a comparable increase in cleaved caspase-3-positive (cCASP3+) cell numbers (Extended Data Fig. 1f) and a decrease in Olfm4 (ISC marker) expression in both diet groups (Extended Data Fig. 1g), indicating analogous crypt damage after irradiation regardless of LXR activation in vivo. By contrast, GW3965-fed mice showed significant upregulation of Olfm4 transcripts in SI crypts at 3 d.p.i. (Extended Data Fig. 1g) with a concomitant increase (around 10%) in surviving crypts (≥10 BrdU+ cells per crypt) and an increased number of BrdU+ cells per crypt at 5 d.p.i. compared with standard-diet-fed mice (Fig. 1g). Moreover, therapeutic administration of the GW3965 diet only during the recovery phase after DSS withdrawal led to increased colonic crypt cell proliferation (Fig. 1h) and colon length (Fig. 1i). This suggests that LXR activation promotes intestinal crypt cell proliferation rather than protection from damage. To functionally confirm the pro-regenerative role of LXR activation in response to damage, mice were treated with DSS for 7 days while being fed with standard or GW3965 diet. On day 9 or 10, distal SI crypts were cultured in vitro in the absence of additional stimuli and were assessed for their ability to form organoids. Using de novo organoid budding as a proxy for regenerative growth18, we observed that in vivo LXR stimulation enhanced intestinal epithelial regenerative growth, as evidenced by an increased number of de novo buds per organoid and a significant relative enrichment of organoids with higher de novo buds (that is, with ≥4 buds per organoid) (Fig. 1j). Together, these results suggest that LXR activation is an adapted response to damage and is sufficient to bolster intestinal epithelial regeneration in the SI and colon.Fig. 1LXR activation in vivo promotes intestinal regeneration in response to damage.a, Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Abca1 transcript levels in 0 and 3 d.p.i.

        "To gain insights into the mechanism, we analysed the overall changes after 10 days of LXR activation in the absence of damage. The absolute numbers of major intestinal immune cell types were comparable between mice that were exposed for 10 days to either standard or GW3965 diet (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Moreover, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis of sorted intestinal epithelial (IEC, EPCAM+CD45−), immune (EPCAM−CD45+) and stromal (double-negative (DN), EPCAM−CD45−) cells did not reveal overt differences in cell composition between mice fed with standard or GW3965 diet (Extended Data Fig. 2c–f). Likewise, spatial transcriptomics analysis of the whole SI using non-negative matrix factorization19 showed comparable spatial distribution of gene programs between GW3965- and standard-diet-fed mice (Extended Data Fig. 2g). To investigate whether LXR activation promoted immunomodulation as previously described16,20,21, we analysed ‘inflammatory response’ genes (annotated using the Gene Ontology database)22 in our scRNA-seq datasets. Despite the strong LXR activation in every cell type analysed, as seen by increased expression of cholesterol metabolism and transporter genes such as Abca1, Abcg1 and Srebf1 (Extended Data Fig. 2h), we observed comparable inflammatory tone in immune cells from standard-diet- and GW3965-treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 2i), therefore suggesting minimal effect on inflammatory immune responses after 10 days of LXR activation.",
        "We next focused on the epithelial cell compartment and analysed the villus and crypt length as a proxy for overall epithelial cell abundance using histological analysis (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Ten days of LXR activation in the absence of damage led to an increase in villus length (and, to a lesser extent, crypt height) (Extended Data Fig. 3a), without affecting ISC proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). To functionally assess whether such previous LXR activation primed the epithelium to enhanced regeneration that might surface after injury, we performed intestinal organoid culture, recapitulating aspects of intestinal regeneration after damage23. Indeed, SI crypts from GW3965-diet fed mice plated in vitro without further treatment formed organoids with more buds compared with those from standard-diet-fed mice (Extended Data Fig. 3d), suggesting that synthetic LXR activation primes the epithelium for increased regenerative growth that surfaces after challenge (that is, when tested for organoid formation). In agreement, spatial transcriptomics datasets from SIs after damage showed increased abundance of factors associated with epithelial cells (NMF3) in GW3965-diet- compared to standard-fed mice (Extended Data Fig. 3e). To test whether LXR activation drives intestinal regeneration in an IEC-autonomous manner, we generated conditional knockout mice lacking both LXR isoforms in IECs (Villin-cre:Nr1h3fl/flNr1h2fl/fl (where Nr1h3 and Nr1h2 encode LXRα and LXRβ, respectively); hereafter, LXRΔIEC mice)24. Intestines from the LXRΔIEC mice did not display any phenotypic alteration at steady state, as evidenced by comparable SI and colon length (Extended Data Fig. 3f,i,j), SI crypt and villus length (Extended Data Fig. 3g) and SI crypt cell proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 3h). However, when exposed to irradiation-induced damage, LXRΔIEC mice showed a significant decrease (~15%) in surviving crypts compared with the littermate controls (Fig. 2a). To mechanistically dissect how IEC-intrinsic LXR activation led to regeneration, we used organoid25 cultures from SI crypts stimulated with GW3965 or vehicle (DMSO) in vitro. GW3965 treatment led to increased Abca1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 4a), enhanced regenerative growth (that is, de novo buds per organoid) and a significant relative enrichment for organoids with higher de novo buds (that is, with ≥4 buds per organoid) (Fig. 2b). To rule out any effect of possible contaminating non-epithelial cells during crypt isolation and subsequent organoid culture, we established organoids using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted LGR5+ ISC–Paneth cell co-culture and observed a similar increase in buds per organoid after LXR activation (Extended Data Fig. 4b), confirming that LXR activation in IEC is sufficient in inducing enhanced regenerative growth. Having observed an epithelial intrinsic pro-regenerative effect in vivo and in vitro, we further analysed the expression of niche factors involved in ISC maintenance, self-renewal and/or differentiation18,26 in SI organoids and ex vivo SI crypts at different timepoints after irradiation. We observed that LXR activation led to comparable transcript levels of notch ligands (Jag1, Jag2, Dll1 and Hes1) and a mild increase in epithelial Wnt3 (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d), compared with the controls. By contrast, we observed a consistent and significant increase in the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-family ligands (that is, Areg, Ereg, Tgfa and Egf) after LXR activation in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4e). As the standard organoid culture medium includes EGF (a component of ENR, that is, EGF, noggin and R-spondin), we postulated that LXR activation might compensate for the lack of EGF if it were removed from the culture medium. Indeed, LXR activation resulted in enhanced regenerative growth in organoids cultured with NR medium (noggin, and R-spondin) (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g, and Fig. 2d–f) and downstream EGFR signalling27,28 (Extended Data Fig. 4h). This enhanced regenerative growth was observed in organoids grown from both crypts (Extended Data Fig. 4f) and single cells derived from primary organoids (Extended Data Fig. 4g and Fig. 2d–f). Notably, in the secondary culture from single cells, in addition to the increased organoid budding (Fig. 2d–f and Supplementary Videos 1–3), we also observed enhanced plating efficiency29 when stimulated with GW3965 (Fig. 2d,e and Supplementary Videos 1–3). This further substantiates the pro-regenerative role of LXR activation in the intestinal epithelium. Together, these results show that LXR activation promotes the expression of EGFR family ligands, thereby driving intestinal epithelial regeneration.Fig. 2LXR promotes intestinal regeneration by inducing epithelial amphiregulin.a, Representative images and quantification of the surviving crypts in LXRΔIEC mice and littermate controls at 3 d.p.i.

        "Next, to unbiasedly investigate the mechanism(s) of LXR mediated pro-regenerative growth in organoids cultivated under NR condition, we performed scRNA-seq analysis of EPCAM+ IECs from DMSO-treated (n = 12,526 cells) and GW3965-treated (n = 11,665 cells) SI organoids (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Unsupervised clustering revealed nine distinct clusters containing all major IEC types4,30 (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 5b). Analysis of Abca1 expression across clusters indicated that all IEC types responded to LXR activation, which did not promote a marked difference in cluster proportions (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 5c,d), suggesting that GW3965 does not induce bias towards specific cell types emanating from ISC in vitro. We next stratified the most highly differentially expressed genes across clusters (Extended Data Fig. 5e). As expected, GW3965 stimulation led to upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol transport (for example, ABC transporters such as Abca1 and Abcg1) and lipid and fatty acid biosynthesis/metabolism (for example, Lpcat3, Srebf1 and Hmgcs2) (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Notably, Areg was the most abundant and differentially expressed EGFR ligand after LXR activation (Extended Data Fig. 5e). A biased survey of the most common niche pathways (that is, WNT, notch and EGFR family ligands) in the scRNA-seq dataset also revealed Areg as the most prominent upregulated gene (Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 5f), differentially expressed by a broad range of IECs (clusters 0–2 and 4–5) (Fig. 2i). In vivo, our spatial transcriptomics datasets from the irradiated intestine revealed that Areg+ spots from 2 out of 12 clusters (clusters 4 and 5) showed the largest increase in Areg expression after LXR activation (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b) and were spatially restricted to the crypt region (Extended Data Fig. 6c). In agreement, the top genes that define clusters 4 and 5 were those that were primarily expressed by crypt-residing Paneth cells, located at the crypt bottom (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization analyses of irradiated SIs showed increased AREG protein (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f) and RNA (Extended Data Fig. 6g) expression after LXR activation in the crypt and crypt–villus junctional region, showing that LXR activation drives amphiregulin expression in pan-crypt IECs after injury. Finally, organoids from LXRΔIEC mice did not upregulate Areg when stimulated with GW3965 (Fig. 2j) with concomitant abrogation of the regenerative growth (Fig. 2k and Extended Data Fig. 6h), therefore demonstrating that LXR activity in IECs is necessary to induce Areg expression and to promote intestinal regeneration.",
        "To test whether AREG was necessary for the pro-regenerative effects of LXR, we used an AREG-neutralizing antibody (Extended Data Fig. 6i) in SI organoids from WT mice (Extended Data Fig. 6j) and generated organoids from crypts isolated from Areg−/− mice (Fig. 2l). We observed abrogation of LXR-induced pro-regenerative effect both when blocking (Extended Data Fig. 6j) or due to lack (Fig. 2l) of amphiregulin. A recent study has shown that EGFR ligands are involved in YAP1-mediated damage-induced regenerative program31. Although depletion of Yap1 in SI organoids established from Villin-creERT2+Yap1fl/flTazfl/fl mice showed downregulation of YAP1-activated genes such as Msln and Il3331, it did not abrogate LXR-induced Abca1 or Areg (Extended Data Fig. 7a–f). This shows that LXR drives its regenerative program through Areg independently of YAP1.",
        "Activation of LXR leads to expression of genes involved in multiple aspects of cholesterol metabolism such as efflux, biosynthesis and absorption32. Importantly, increasing cellular cholesterol either by adding exogenous/dietary cholesterol or by increasing cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake has been associated with enhanced IEC proliferation and consequently regeneration33. Thus, to test whether LXR-dependent regulation of cholesterol remodelling has a role in IEC regeneration, we treated LXR-sufficient and LXR-deficient organoids with cholesterol and assessed their regenerative potential. Consistent with a previous report33, cholesterol treatment of SI organoids resulted in enhanced regenerative growth, with organoids exhibiting higher de novo buds (that is, with ≥4 buds per organoid) compared with the vehicle control (Extended Data Fig. 8a). However, LXR-deficient organoids did not show enhanced budding in the presence of cholesterol (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Together, these data suggest that LXR activation promotes regeneration through its role as a regulator of cellular cholesterol remodelling and through transcriptional control of pro-regenerative mediators (such as Areg).",
        "Mirroring the effect of GW3965, organoids stimulated with an another LXR agonist RGX-104, currently in a multicentre phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced solid malignancies and lymphoma (NCT02922764), also led to increased budding and was accompanied by upregulation of Areg (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). Moreover, single-cell replating of primary colonic epithelial organoids (Extended Data Fig. 8d) led to enhanced plating efficiency and organoid area (Extended Data Fig. 8e–g and Supplementary Videos 4 and 5) after LXR activation. This was accompanied by an increase in Areg expression (Extended Data Fig. 8h), indicating a regenerative growth pattern similar to that observed in SI organoids. Finally, in support of LXR activation as a more generalized mechanism of tissue regeneration, we observed a similar growth advantage and induction of Areg expression after LXR activation in vitro in salivary gland organoids34 (Extended Data Fig. 8i). Consistent with the in vitro findings, in vivo LXR activation in a radiation-induced salivary gland injury model resulted in overall increase in the ductal area, a parameter used as a proxy to evaluate salivary gland regeneration (Extended Data Fig. 8j). Together, our data reveal a broader regenerative program driven by LXR-induced amphiregulin in epithelial cells.",
        "To gain insights into the endogenous ligands that might activate LXR after damage, we examined pathways that produce oxysterols35, which are generated from cholesterol by the members of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase family Cyp27a1, Cyp46a1, Cyp11a1 and Ch25h35,36 (Fig. 3a). Revisiting the scRNA-seq datasets from regenerating SI crypts4 (Fig. 3b) and our published RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset using colonic biopsies5 (Fig. 3c) together with qPCR on ileal crypts over the course of DSS-induced injury–repair (Fig. 3d), we observed a selective increase in Cyp27a1 expression during the regenerative phase, whereas other enzymes were either undetectable or upregulated across the whole response. Similarly, in the SI, immunohistochemical analysis showed induction of CYP27A1 after irradiation-induced intestinal injury (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 9a–d). Although the majority of CYP27A1+ cells in the SI were found in the villi, after irradiation, CYP27A1 was initially expressed in the crypt epithelium (1 d.p.i.) and later (3–5 d.p.i.) in the lamina propria (LP) adjacent to the crypts (Extended Data Fig. 9b–d), suggesting local production of 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC). Consistently, analysis of Cyp27a1 expression in FACS-sorted epithelial (EPCAM+CD45−), immune (EPCAM−CD45+) and DN (EPCAM−CD45−) cells from SIs of mice undergoing irradiation-induced injury–repair (Extended Data Fig. 9e–g) showed a significant upregulation in IECs by 1 d.p.i. (Fig. 3f) and was accompanied by a concurrent increase in LXR target gene Abca1 (Fig. 3g). We therefore investigated whether CYP27A1 was necessary to promote LXR-dependent intestinal regeneration in vivo. Sorted IECs from whole-body-irradiated Cyp27a1−/− mice showed reduced Cyp27a1, with a concomitant reduction in Abca1 compared with the littermate controls (Fig. 3h), suggesting that lack of Cyp27a1 dampens LXR activity in IECs. After irradiation, Cyp27a1−/− mice displayed reduced surviving crypts compared with their littermate controls, and LXR activation by GW3965 diet administration rescued crypt cell proliferation (Fig. 3i). Furthermore, Cyp27a1−/− mice displayed reduced colon length (Extended Data Fig. 9h) and worsened histological score (Extended Data Fig. 9i) after DSS-induced damage compared with the littermate controls. However, given the known role of CYP27A1 in regulating bile acids and cholesterol absorption37, it remains possible that whole-body deletion of Cyp27a1 compromises intestinal regeneration not solely by affecting LXR signalling. Finally, to test whether this axis was a conserved response to injury in humans, we observed increased expression of both CYP27A1 and ABCA1 in the terminal ileum and colon (ascending, transverse and sigmoid rectum) of patients with active ulcerative colitis38 compared with in patients in remission (Fig. 3j). Collectively, these results revealed an ISC-niche adaptation to damage whereby Cyp27a1, upregulated in response to injury, drives LXR activation in IEC and promotes intestinal regeneration.Fig. 3CYP27A1 is upregulated during intestinal injury and promotes intestinal regeneration.a, Schematic of cholesterol metabolism to oxysterols by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase family of enzymes (CYPs) and its downstream action on LXR. b, The average expression (colour coded) and the percentage of cells (circle size) expressing oxysterol-producing enzymes in SI crypts at 0 (Ctrl) or 3 d.p.i.

        "Pathways used by ISC to self-renew and regenerate during barrier repair can be hijacked by cancer stem cells, leading to uncontrolled proliferation1–3. To investigate the role of LXR in intestinal tumorigenesis, ApcMin/+ mice were fed with GW3965 or standard diet and analysed for adenoma formation. Consistent with previous findings of mice engineered to express a constitutively active form of LXRα specifically in epithelial cells39, ApcMin/+ mice fed with the GW3965 diet resulted in reduced tumour numbers and size compared with the control mice (Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). Likewise, extending our findings to the azoxymethane (AOM)–DSS inflammation-driven colorectal cancer (CRC) model, we observed reduced tumour numbers and size after LXR activation (Extended Data Fig. 10d,e and Fig. 4a). Furthermore, Cyp27a1−/− mice treated with AOM–DSS displayed more and larger tumours compared with their littermate controls and GW3965 administration in Cyp27a1−/− mice rescued this phenotype (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 10f), suggesting that LXR activation downstream to CYP27A1 restrains intestinal tumorigenesis. Extending our findings to humans, we further confirmed downregulation of CYP27A1 in the colonic epithelium from patients with CRC compared with healthy individuals (Extended Data Fig. 10g,h), suggesting that suppression of the CYP27A1–LXR axis might function as a tumour-escape mechanism. The mechanisms involved in the reciprocal regulation of CYP27A1 in the context of regeneration and tumorigenesis remain to be addressed and constitute an important area for future investigation. Enhanced expression of EGFR ligands including amphiregulin are observed in multiple human malignancies including CRC40. However, despite LXR-activation-induced Areg expression in response to damage, we did not observe induction of EGFR ligands in the context of tumorigenesis (Extended Data Fig. 10i). To further investigate LXR-mediated anti-tumour mechanism(s), we performed bulk RNA-seq analysis of the colonic tissue in the presence or absence of GW3965-mediated LXR activation at different timepoints during AOM–DSS tumorigenesis (Fig. 4c). Timepoints were chosen based on the analysis of macroscopic tumours—day 22 showed no tumours, day 43 showed tumours almost exclusively in control mice and day 70 showed tumour development in both GW3965- and standard diet-fed mice, albeit to a different extent (Extended Data Fig. 10d,e,j,k). Longitudinal analysis combining differential gene expression (DEGs in diet and/or diet:time interaction) and hierarchical clustering5 resulted in nine distinct modules (Fig. 4c). Each module was defined by a set of genes displaying similar expression pattern across timepoints and diet groups, and we used KEGG pathway analysis to identify which pathways were enriched in each module (Fig. 4c). Among the modules, m5 (enriched for pathways annotated as haematopoietic cell lineage and intestinal immune network for IgA production) started to diverge and was upregulated in GW3965-fed mice after day 22 onwards (Fig. 4c), mirroring the difference observed in overall tumour growth between the two groups (Extended Data Fig. 10j,k). Moreover, m5 showed comparable expression between standard diet- and GW3965-diet-fed mice at day 0 (that is, mice fed either standard or GW3965 diet for 22 or 43 days without any AOM–DSS treatment), arguing that LXR-dependent activation of this gene program is fuelled by the tumorigenesis process (Fig. 4c). Organization of immune cells in tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) is associated with favourable prognosis in patients with CRC (as reviewed previously41,42). To evaluate whether the sustained expression of m5 genes in GW3965-fed mice correlated with enhanced TLS formation and plasma cell signature in the tissue, we performed spatial transcriptomics analysis of the colonic tissue of standard-diet- and GW3965-fed mice at day 22 and day 43 of AOM–DSS treatment (Extended Data Fig. 10l). LXR activation in the context of AOM–DSS treatment promoted the formation of B-cell-signature-enriched TLS at day 22 and more prominently at day 43, and the widespread expression of plasma cell signatures in the GW3965-treated colon at day 43 compared with the standard-diet-fed controls (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of the B cell marker B220 revealed a significant increase in B cell follicles in the colon of GW3965-fed compared with in standard-diet-fed mice (Fig. 4e) at day 70 of AOM–DSS treatment. TLSs have been described as sites of induction of adaptive anti-tumour immune responses including expansion and/or infiltration of cytotoxic CD8 T cells43–46. To assess whether expansion/activation of adaptive immunity functionally underlined the reduced tumour formation observed after LXR activation, we treated GW3965- and standard-diet-fed mice with anti-CD19 and anti-CD8 antibodies (together or separately) or isotype control or PBS starting at day 22 and at repeated timepoints over the course of AOM–DSS administration (Fig. 4f,g and Extended Data Fig. 11a,b). After GW3965 treatment, simultaneous blocking of CD19 and CD8 significantly increased tumour formation compared with the control-treated mice (Fig. 4f,g), demonstrating that B and T lymphocytes contribute to the LXR-mediated anti-tumour response. To examine the potential relevance of LXR activation in human CRC, we analysed the expression of CYP27A1, LXR target genes and TLS/B and T cell signatures in a published dataset containing 443 CRC samples divided into six tumour subtypes (c1 to c6)47. Expression of the LXR ligand producing enzyme CYP27A1, LXR target gene ABCG1 (but not ABCA1) and TLS/B and T cell signatures (MS4A1, CD19, CR2, CD8a, GZMB and CD69) was decreased in tumours compared with non-tumour samples (Extended Data Fig. 11c), suggesting that suppression of the CYP27A1–LXR–TLS/B cell axis might function as a tumour-escape mechanism in human CRC.Fig. 4LXR activation in vivo suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis.a, Representative images and quantification of tumour numbers and size at day 70 of AOM–DSS-induced tumorigenesis in WT mice that were fed a standard or GW3965 diet.

        "Overall, our work proposes a mechanism of disease tolerance48 in ISCs and their niche whereby LXR activation functions as a rheostat that enables adaptation to barrier damage without compromising the host fitness by reducing the risk of tumorigenesis. We found that, whereas LXR activation in the context of intestinal injury promotes regeneration by modulating ISC-niche derived signals such as AREG, it puts a check on the uncontrolled proliferation of the otherwise transformed cells by eliciting tumour suppressive mechanisms mediated by adaptive immune cells. Notably, such responses seem to be locally choreographed by the upregulation of CYP27A1 triggered by barrier damage. The risk of neoplastic transformation in the aftermath of regeneration must be carefully considered for the development of safe therapies against chronic intestinal disorders. LXR activation may represent one such pathway conserved across tissues, injury models and species that balances these processes to preserve homeostasis. Our results showed that LXR signalling reciprocally regulates intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis (Extended Data Fig. 12).",

Then, 1 week later, 1.5–2% (w/v) DSS (TdB Consultancy, molecular weight 40 kDa) was administered in the drinking water for 7 days followed by 2 weeks of regular water. The same DSS treatment was repeated for two more cycles (three cycles in total), each time with an interval of 2 weeks of regular water in between. Mice were euthanized at the indicated timepoints and colon samples were collected. Anti-CD19 (300 µg per mouse per injection, BioXcell, 1D3) and anti-CD8β (300 µg per mouse per injection, BioXcell, Lyt3.2) were treated alone or in combination i.p. every 7 days starting from day 22 (that is, after the first round of DSS treatment) until the end of the experiment. Control mice were injected 300 µg per mouse per injection with isotype control (rat IgG2a, BioXcell) or PBS. The tumour number and size were evaluated manually using a digital micro-caliper. Tissue biopsies for RNA extraction were collected from the distal colon (corresponding to tumour areas). Colon tissues were then Swiss-rolled for histological analysis. Histological scoring of tumours was performed in a blinded manner using the H&E stained Swiss-rolls in which the tumour areas were categorized into either well-differentiated, well-moderately differentiated or moderately differentiated. The dysplastic regions seen in the tissues were from the non-tumour area and not the dysplasia within the tumour.",
        "ApcMin/+ mice (aged 4–5 weeks) were given the modified diet (standard or GW3965-diet) ad libitum for the entire duration of the experiment. Mice were euthanized at around 4 months of age and macroscopic tumours were measured and counted manually.",
        "Adult mice were exposed to a dose of 10 Gy from an X Radiation Unit (CIX3 X-Ray Cabinet or with an X-RAD 320 irradiation source with 20 × 20 cm irradiation field within a mouse pie) and euthanized at the indicated timepoints. At the indicated timepoints, SI tissues were either Swiss rolled for histological analyses, Visium processing or SI crypts were isolated as described below in the ‘SI organoids’ section. Histological analyses of H&E-stained tissues embedded in paraffin was conducted using Visiopharm (v.23.01), an artificial-intelligence-powered pathology program that uses a trainable algorithm based on a convolutional neural network. The regions of interest (ROIs) within the Swiss roll (that is, the total measured area) were manually selected to exclude damaged areas caused by tissue rolling artefacts. Subsequently, the crypt and villus area within these selected ROIs were quantified. Crypt hyperplasia was evaluated using normalized crypt area (that is, crypt area/total area) and the crypt area-to-villus area ratio.",
        "Mice at the indicated timepoints were first anaesthetized in the isoflurane chamber (1% O2, 1% air and 5% flow rate), and, once asleep, were transferred to the irradiator bed with 0.3% O2, 0.3% air and 1.5% flow rate until the irradiation protocol was finished. The mice were irradiated individually using X-ray irradiator CIX3 (Xstrahl) with only the neck exposed using 1 cm focal tube and rest of the body and head shielded. An X-ray irradiation dose of 9 Gy (that is, 300 kV, 10 mA for a period of 7.04 min) was administered. After irradiation, the mice were monitored until they were fully conscious and awake. Non-irradiated control mice were subjected only to the anaesthesia protocol without being irradiated. Mice were euthanized at 14 d.p.i. and salivary glands were collected and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histological analysis.",
        "To get automatized quantification of salivary gland histology, a deep learning algorithm was developed to automatically segment and classify ducts, blood and air from histological tissue samples. For dataset preparation, histological images underwent tile extraction and preprocessing, following the NoCodeSeg framework (35155486). The dataset included 43 training patients and 1 testing patient. Tiles of 512 × 512 pixels in size were obtained using QuPath. The training dataset comprised 35,506 objects, addressing class imbalances through augmentation. For deep learning model training, a deep learning model, based on the Xception architecture51 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357), was trained using the MIB52 MATLAB package. Parameters were saved for the model, and training used 512 × 512 pixel patches. The validation set was split randomly for training (97%) and validation (3%). For model evaluation, post-training, the model’s performance was assessed using loss curves and a confusion matrix on the test set. For application of trained model, the trained model was integrated into FastPathology for practical application. This involved copying the model and pipeline files, creating a new project, adding images and selecting the pipeline for processing. Annotations in QuPath were loaded into QuPath by downloading and running the provided script for each image in the project. More details about the training and inference of the model can be found on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/BIIFSweden/EduardoVillablanca2023-1). Outliers were identified and removed from the imported data in R using the boxplot function. Subsequently, the combined GW0 (n = 2) and STD0 (n = 2) datasets were analysed, yielding summary statistics. Bin analysis was performed using breaks delineated at 0 to first quartile, first quartile to mean, mean to third quartile and third quartile to the maximum, labelled as noise, small, medium and large, respectively. Noise-tagged ducts were filtered out, and their distributions were visualized through violin plots. The mean and s.d. of duct areas were computed for each biological replicate, followed by the application of Welch two sample t-tests to compare treatments.",
        "Mouse SI organoids were obtained from purified crypts derived from the entire SI, unless specified. In brief, SI tissue was flushed with cold PBS, cleaned from attached fat tissue, cut opened longitudinally and subsequently cut into approximately 0.5 cm pieces. Tissues were incubated in 30 ml of 10 mM cold PBS-EDTA on ice for the following incubation periods: 10 min, 3 × 15 min and 1 h. After each incubation, tubes were gently shaken, supernatant containing tissue debris and villi fractions were discarded and fresh PBS-EDTA was added. After the last incubation, the tubes were vigorously shaken and filtered through 70 µm cell strainers and isolated SI crypts were retrieved in the flow-through. The last step was repeated until no more crypts were present in the flow-through. Alternatively, SI tissue, flushed with PBS and cut opened longitudinally, was cut into 4–5 pieces (approximately 7 cm long) and incubated for 1 h in ice cold 10 mM PBS-EDTA. Using two glass slides, intestinal villi were then removed by gentle scraping of the luminal side. SI crypts were then scraped by applying stronger pressure with the glass slides and collected in recipient tubes filled with cold PBS. Crypts were centrifuged at 4 °C, 300g for 5 min. The basic culture medium (ENR) contained advanced DMEM/F12, 1× penicillin–streptomycin, 1× GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1× B27 (Life Technologies), 1× N2 (Life Technologies), 1 mM N-acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich) and was supplemented with 50 ng ml−1 of murine recombinant epidermal growth factor (that is, EGF, from R&D), 250–500 ng ml−1 recombinant murine R-spondin (R&D) and 100 ng ml−1 recombinant murine Noggin (Peprotech). For experiments with NR medium, the same medium as above with the exception of EGF was prepared. SI crypts were resuspended in 30–40% basic culture medium with 60–70% Matrigel (Corning) and 20 µl containing approximately 300–500 crypts were plated in a prewarmed flat-bottom 48-well plate. The plate was placed at 37 °C and allowed to solidify for 15 min before 200 µl of ENR or NR medium (containing the different stimuli) was overlaid. The medium was replaced every 2 days with fresh medium and the cultures were maintained at 37 °C in fully humidified chambers containing 5% CO2. Only on the first 2 days of culture, 10 µM Y-27632 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added in the medium. For in vitro stimulation, LXR agonist GW3965 (1 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) or RGX-104 (1 µM, MedChemExpress) was added in the medium for the entire duration of the organoid culture. DMSO was used as vehicle. For rAREG and anti-AREG experiment, rAREG (50 ng ml−1, Peprotech) and/or anti-AREG (1.5 µg ml−1, R&D Systems) were added in the medium for the entire duration of the organoid culture. For experiments with cholesterol, water soluble cholesterol (50 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) was added into the medium for the entire duration of the organoid culture. For organoids from Villin-creERT2 Yap1fl/flTazfl/fl mice, tamoxifen (1 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) treatment was performed in secondary organoids as indicated with or without GW3965 treatment. In brief, primary organoids from Villin-creERT2 Yap1fl/flTazfl/fl mice grown under either ENR or NR conditions were recovered from Matrigel by two washes with 0.1% BSA PBS. The organoids were mechanically fragmented by passing (30 times) through a 200 μl pipette tip. Equal amounts of organoid fragments were plated in 20 µl Matrigel (70% Matrigel) dome in a prewarmed 48-well plate and cultured for 5–8 days as indicated. Secondary organoids were cultured using either ENR or NR medium containing DMSO or GW3965 (1 µM). Y-27632 (10 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) was added only during the first 2 days of the culture, with medium change done every 2–3 days afterwards. Tamoxifen (1 μM; Sigma-Aldrich) was added at the indicated timepoints. For ileal organoids after DSS treatment, mice were given 2% DSS in the drinking water for 7 days followed by normal drinking water. Two to three days after DSS removal, the crypts were isolated from the distal third of the SI (that is, ileum) and organoids were cultured in either ENR or NR medium as described above. Crypt domain budding was quantified under the microscope at the indicated days in a blinded manner. Each condition was plated in triplicates and 2–3 wells per condition were quantified. Each dot in the quantification plot represents one mouse and an average of 2–3 technical replicates. Furthermore, organoids were stratified based on the number of buds/organoid (0, 1, 2, 3 or ≥4) and plotted as the percentage of organoids per well. Organoids were collected at the indicated timepoints and stored in RLT-Plus buffer (Qiagen) + 2% β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) at −80 °C until RNA extraction.",
        "For replating experiments (passage 1), single cells were isolated from WT (C57BL/6) mouse primary SI organoids grown under either ENR-DMSO, NR-DMSO or NR-GW3965 (1 µM) for a period of 5 days, as described before. In brief, primary organoids from respective culture conditions were digested with TrypLE Express (Gibco) with 1,200 U ml−1 of DNase I (Roche) at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were then washed; dead cells were removed using the EasySep dead cell removal (Annexin V) kit (STEM Cells), filtered using 40 µm filters and live cells were counted using the Guava Muse cell counter (Cytek) and the Muse Count and Viability Kit (Cytek). Equal numbers (10,000) of live IECs per condition in a 20 µl Matrigel (70% Matrigel) dome were plated in prewarmed 48-well plate and cultured for 6–7 days and were longitudinally imaged using the Incucyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis Instrument (Sartorius). Cells from ENR-DMSO, NR-DMSO or NR-GW3965 (1 µM) were cultured in respective medium with WNT-surrogate Fc (1 nM) (IpA Therapeutics) and Y-27632 (10 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) added only during the first 3 days of the culture, with medium change done every 2 days afterwards. Organoid numbers on day 4 counted using the Incucyte Organoid Analysis Software Module were used to estimate the organoid plating efficiency (that is, the number of organoids/10,000 × 100). Buds per organoid and the percentage of budding organoids were estimated from day 6/7 images which were counted manually using Fiji/ImageJ (NIH).",
        "After crypt isolation from the whole colon of WT (C57BL/6) mice, crypts were resuspended in 70% Matrigel (BD Bioscience) and 30% basal medium (advanced DMEM/F12, 1× penicillin–streptomycin, 1× GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1× B27 (Life Technologies), 1 mM N-acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich)). To establish primary colon organoids, approximately 500–600 crypts embedded in 20 μl of Matrigel (70%):crypt suspension (30%) and were seeded onto each well of a 48-well plate. Once solidified, the Matrigel was incubated in 200 μl WENR stem cell medium for 3 days supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 (R&D Systems). The stem cell culture medium (WENR) contained basal medium supplemented with 50 ng ml−1 of recombinant murine EGF (R&D), 500 ng ml−1 recombinant murine R-spondin (R&D), 100 ng ml−1 recombinant murine noggin (Peprotech), 500 nM A83-01 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 nM WNT surrogate Fc (IpA Therapeutics). On day 3, WENR stem cell medium was replaced with ENR differentiating medium lacking WNT surrogate Fc, nicotinamide and Y-27632, with subsequent medium change every 2 days. All throughout the primary organoid culture, DMSO or GW3965 (1 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the culture medium.",
        "For replating experiments (passage 1), single cells were isolated from the primary colon organoids grown under either DMSO or GW3965 (1 µM) for a period of 6–7 days. In brief, primary colon organoids from the respective culture conditions were digested with TrypLE Express (Gibco) with 1,200 U ml−1 of DNase I (Roche) at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were then washed; dead cells were removed using the EasySep dead cell removal (annexin V) kit (StemCell), filtered using 40 µm filters and live cells were counted using Guava Muse cell counter (Cytek) and the Muse Count and Viability Kit (Cytek).

Cells from DMSO-treated or GW3965-treated (1 µM) conditions were cultured in respective WENR stem cell medium for first 3 days, followed by differentiating ENR medium with subsequent medium change every 2 days. Organoid numbers on day 4 counted using the Incucyte Organoid Analysis Software Module were used to estimate the organoid plating efficiency (that is, the number of organoids/10,000 × 100). Furthermore, owing to non-budding nature of the colon organoids, the total organoid area was estimated using the Incucyte organoid module. Colon organoids were collected at day 6/7 after single-cell seeding for gene expression analysis using qPCR.",
        "A set of representative images was chosen to ensure comprehensive coverage of organoid structures. The background to cell ratio was adjusted to accurately define the boundaries of organoid objects. Subsequently, the bright-field mask was evaluated, and filter parameters were refined accordingly. The refined bright-field mask was then applied to the image set, and a verification was conducted to ensure effective masking across all representative images. The edge split parameter was adjusted to delineate between individual organoid objects and refine segmentation. The bright-field mask was re-evaluated, and filter parameters were refined to ensure optimal delineation. After confirming that the parameters appropriately masked all organoids in the representative images, the Launch Wizard analysis was completed by selecting the scan times and wells to be analysed. This final step ensured a systematic and thorough analysis of organoid structures in the selected images.",
        "Salivary gland organoids were cultured according to the protocol published before34. Salivary glands from WT (C57BL/6J) mice were collected in 2,880 μl of RPMI (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine, 1× penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5% FCS and 0.1 mg ml−1 DNase I (Roche). The salivary glands were minced with scissors into small pieces followed by addition of 120 μl of 25 mg ml−1 of collagenase D (Sigma-Aldrich) to the 2,880 μl of RPMI. Tissues were incubated at 37 °C with gentle agitation for 40 min. Digestion was stopped by adding 30 μl of 0.5 M EDTA (Invitrogen). Cell suspensions were filtered using 100 µm cell strainers (Corning), centrifuged at 300g for 8 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was further digested with TrypLE Express (Gibco) with 1,200 U ml−1 of DNase I (Roche) at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were then washed, resuspended in advanced DMEM/F12 (Gibco) with 1× HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then plated for organoids. Cells in basic culture medium were mixed with Matrigel (Corning) at a ratio of 30 (medium):70 (Matrigel) and 20 μl of mixture was plated carefully on to the centre of prewarmed flat bottom 48-well cell culture plate. The plate was placed at 37 °C and allowed to solidify for 15 min before 200 μl of organoid medium was added to each well. The basic culture medium contained advanced DMEM/F12, 1× penicillin–streptomycin, 1× GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1× B27 (Life Technologies), 1× N2 (Life Technologies) and 1 mM N-acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich), and was supplemented with 0.2 µg ml−1 Primocin (InVivoGen), 100 ng ml−1 of murine noggin (Peprotech), 100 ng ml−1 recombinant murine R-spondin (R&D), 5 nM FGF1 (Peprotech), 1 nM FGF7 (Peprotech), 5 nM NRG1 (R&D) and 0.5 µM A83-01 (Merck). The medium was changed every 3 days and the cultures were maintained at 37 °C in fully humidified chambers containing 5% CO2. For first 7 days of culture, 10 µM Y-27632 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added in the medium. On day 7, the salivary glands were washed to clean the Matrigel and replated without breaking the organoids. On day 7, while replating, DMSO or GW3965 (1 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the organoid medium without further addition of Y-27632. Then, 3 days after (day 10), when the medium was replenished, DAPT (5 µM, Tocris) was added to the culture medium. Organoids were imaged using the Nikon SMZ25 microscope with the NIS Elements software and collected for gene expression analysis between day 11 and day 13. For quantification of organoid area, z stacks of whole-well images were converted to a focused EDF document and, using Affinity Photo 2, the contrast and gamma ratio were adjusted for each image, cropped in oval mode to remove edges but take all organoids. Segmentation analysis was performed using OrganoSeg software53 according to the instructions and the organoid area was measured for each organoid and averaged per well from four different experiments.",
        "To obtain single cells, isolated SI crypts were digested with TrypLE Express (Gibco) with 1,200 U ml−1 of DNase I (Roche) at 32 °C for 90 s.

After staining, cells were washed in SMEM (Sigma-Aldrich), filtered using 70 µm filter and resuspended in SMEM supplemented with 7-AAD (BD Bioscience, 1:500). Cells were sorted using the FACS ARIA II (BD Biosciences) system. Sorting strategies were as follows: ISCs, Lgr5eGFPhighEPCAM+CD24med/−CD31−Ter119−CD45−7-AAD−; Paneth cells, CD24highsidescatterhighLgr5eGFP−EPCAM+CD31−Ter119−CD45−7-AAD−. For organoid co-culture, ISCs were sorted from Lgr5-eGFP-creERT2 mice and PCs were sorted from non-Lgr5 WT mice. Equal numbers (~5,000 each) of ISCs and PCs were co-cultured using standard ENR medium further supplemented with additional 500 ng ml−1 R-spondin (to have a final concentration of 1,000 ng ml−1), 100 ng ml−1 WNT3A (R&D Systems) and 10 µM jagged-1 peptide (Anaspec) for first 4 days together with 10 µM Y-27632. After 4 days, the medium was changed to regular ENR medium. For in vitro stimulation, LXR agonist (1 µM GW3965) was added in the medium for the entire duration of the organoid culture. DMSO was used as vehicle. Crypt domain budding was quantified on day 8 after starting the co-culture.",
        "Cell isolation from the mouse intestine performed using previously published protocol5 with a few modifications. In brief, dissected SIs were flushed with cold PBS to remove the intestinal content and mucus, then cut open longitudinally and cut into ~1 cm pieces. To isolate the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and the intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), intestinal pieces were incubated in HBSS (HyClone) supplemented with 5% FCS, 15 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5 mM EDTA (Life technologies) and 1 mM DTT for 30 min at 37 °C under agitation at 800 rpm. The supernatant (called IEL fraction) containing IECs and intraepithelial lymphocytes was filtered through 100 µm cell strainers, centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C and was enriched using a 44%/67% Percoll gradient and washed for FACS analysis. To further isolate the cells from the LP, the intestinal pieces were washed with PBS supplemented with 5% FCS and 1 mM EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C under agitation at 800 rpm. Next, the tissue pieces were digested in HBSS supplemented with 0.15 mg ml−1 liberase TL (Roche) or 0.5 mg ml−1 collagenase D (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 mg ml−1 DNase I (Roche) at 37 °C for 45 min under agitation at 800 rpm.

Next, cell suspensions were prepared and the respective fractions (that is, IEL and LP) were pooled before sorting IECs, immune and DN cells as described above. For scRNA-seq analysis of SI organoids, organoids were established using SI crypts from WT C57BL/6J mice (n = 2) and grown with NR culture medium and were treated with either DMSO or 1 µM GW3965 for 5 days with medium change every 48 h. On day 5, organoids were removed from Matrigel, cleaned with cold PBS and digested with TrypLE Express (Gibco) with 1,200 U ml−1 of DNase I (Roche) at 32 °C for 5 min. After digestion, cells were washed and filtered using 70 µm filter. Single-cell suspensions were blocked with Fc-blocking solution (eBioscience, 1:1,000) and stained with the antibody mix (1:200) at 4 °C for 15 min. The following antibodies were used for the staining: EPCAM-FITC (BioLegend, G8.8), CD45-PeCy7 (BioLegend, 104), Ter119-Pacific Blue (BioLegend, Ter119). EPCAM+CD45−Ter119−DAPI− epithelial cells (IECs) were sorted using the SONY SH800S cell sorter.

Clustering was performed using FindNeighbors (dims = 1:30, k.param = 200, prune.SNN = 1/15) and FindClusters (original Louvain algorithm at resolution 0.5). Differential expression was analysed using FindAllMarkers (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, log[fold change] > 0.2, P < 0.01) for cluster markers (subsampling 50 cells per cluster, difference in percentage > 0.2) and diet groups within clusters (subsampling 150 cells).",
        "For the SI dataset, a primary UMAP was performed using all samples (based on the first 20 components of a principal component analysis (PCA) based on the 2,000 most highly variable genes). The two epithelial samples were integrated as for the organoid dataset and clustering was performed (FindNeighbors parameters: dims = 1:30, k.param = 200, prune.SNN = 1/15). The four immune and double negative samples were integrated as two samples, considering the two samples from the same animals as one, and clustering was performed as for the epithelial samples. Clusters were annotated manually using differential gene expression (FindAllMarkers as above). Differential expression analysis was performed between the standard-food and GW3965 samples for each sorting fraction separately using FindMarkers (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, subsampling 500 cells per group). The expression of inflammatory response genes was calculated using the Seurat function AddModuleScore using the genes included in GO term inflammatory response (GO: 0006954).",
        "SI tissues from standard- and GW3965-diet fed mice at 0 and 3 d.p.i. were used for spatial transcriptomics. Colonic tissues from standard- and GW3965-diet fed mice at day 22 and day 43 of AOM–DSS treatment and untreated mice fed with standard diet only (day 0) were processed for spatial transcriptomics. In brief, SI and colon were cleaned from adipose tissue and cut longitudinally to remove the luminal content by washing in ice-cold PBS. Starting from the most distal portion, that is, ileum for SI and rectum for colon, the tissues were rolled, resulting in a Swiss roll with the most distal part in the centre and the proximal part in the outer portion of the roll. The Swiss rolls were snap-frozen for 1 min in a liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane bath within a plastic tissue cassette. The frozen tissues were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT, Sakura Tissue-TEK) on dry ice for slow cooling and stored at −80 °C. Tissue sections (thickness, 10 µm) were cut using a pre-cooled cryostat and the tissue sections were transferred onto the oligo-barcoded capture areas (6.5 mm2) on the 10x Visium Genomics slide and stored at −80 °C until further processing. The Visium spatial transcriptomics protocol was performed according to previously published studies19 and the manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics, Visium Spatial Transcriptomic). H&E stained images were captured using a Leica DM5500 B microscope (Leica Microsystems) at 5X magnification. The Leica Application Suite X (LAS X) was used to acquire tile scans of the entire array and merge images. Sequence libraries were then processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics, Visium Spatial Transcriptomic). After the second cDNA strand synthesis, cDNA was quantified using the RT-qPCR ABI 7500 Fast RealTime PCR System and analysed using ABI 7500 v.2.3.",
        "Visium libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq S1 flow cell (Illumina), at a depth of around 200 million reads per sample, with 28 bases from read 1 and 120 bases from read 2. FASTQ files were processed with SpaceRanger (10x Genomics) v.1.1.0 (colon) or v.1.2.0 (SI) mapped to the pre-built mm10 reference genome (GRCm38).",
        "The SI datasets was analysed using Seurat v.4.1.1 in R v.4.0.5 as follows. SpaceRanger output was imported and spots with fewer than 20 unique expressed genes were removed, as were genes expressed in fewer than 5 spots. PCA was performed using the 4,000 most highly variable genes. Harmony56 was used to integrate the four samples. Graph construction was performed with the RcppHNSW57 package using the first 50 dimensions in harmony, k = 20 and cosine distance, followed by Louvain clustering using the igraph58 package. Differential expression between clusters was computed using Seurat function FindAllMarkers, with genes considered to be significant at FDR < 0.05 and log2[FC] > 0.25. Differential expression between standard diet samples at 0 d.p.i. and 3 d.p.i. was calculated using the Seurat function FindMarkers. Changes in Areg expression between conditions were analysed by identifying Areg+ spots (read counts > 0) and performing differential expression between Areg+ spots in standard-diet and GW3965 samples at 3 d.p.i., rerunning the analysis for each cluster separately. Non-negative matrix factorization was performed using the cNMF package in Python (v.3.9)59.",
        "Visium sequencing data were processed using SpaceRanger software v.1.1. Six colonic sections were used for analysis, spanning from healthy control (that is, 43 days of standard diet without any AOM–DSS treatment, defined as day 0), AOM–DSS-induced CRC on standard diet at two timepoints (day 22 and day 43) and AOM–DSS-induced CRC on a diet containing GW3965 at two timepoints (GW day 22 and GW day 43). We also used a public single-cell dataset (GSE148794)49 containing the major immune, stromal and epithelial cells during the time course of DSS colitis, both at steady state and during inflammation. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data were analysed using Seurat54. Genes related to mitochondrial and Malat1 as well as those detected in at least 5 cells were omitted from the downstream analysis. The top 4,000 highly variable genes were used for denoising using PCA (50 PCs), which in turn was used for visualization using UMAP (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426), k-nearest neighbour graph construction on cosine distance and finally clustering using Louvain (resolution = 1). Cell clusters were annotated based on differentially expressed markers genes49. Projection of the aforementioned single-cell clusters onto the CRC Visium dataset was done using weighted non-negative least squares implemented in the SCDC package60, a robust and fast method for cell type deconvolution61. Cell type abundances were compared pair-wise between conditions and their respective control (either day 0 or day 22/day 43) using Wilcoxon tests. Alterations in cell–cell co-detection in spatial transcriptomics spots was quantified and compared between GW3965 and standard diets, using the approach previously described62. Significant alterations were projected back to the single-cell UMAP embeddings for illustration.",
        "cDNA libraries were constructed and sequenced by Novogene at a sequencing depth of 20 million reads per sample using paired-end 150 bp reads on the NovaSeq 6000 sequencer and the v1.0 reagent kit. Raw sequences were quantified and annotated using Kallisto63 and GRCm38 (mm10) cDNA assembly64. Resulting gene counts were used for the following analyses, which were performed in R v.3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2020, https://www.R-project.org/). Owing to important differences in RNA degradation and the ribosomal RNA percentage between samples, analyses included corrections for the percentage of ribosomal RNA as described below. DEGs were identified with edgeR65, according to the linear model y ~ diet × time × percentage of ribosomal RNA. Genes were included in the module analysis if FDR < 0.05 in a likelihood ratio test including the diet and diet:interaction terms of the model (H0: coefficients for all included terms equal 0). For all DEGs, log[FC] values were calculated for each group by combining log[FC] values from the likelihood ratio test for each relevant term (for example, log[FC]d70-GW3965 = 0 + log[FC]d70 + log[FC]GW3965 + log[FC]d70:GW39765). These log[FC] estimates were scaled by the mean and s.d., and scaled log[FC] values of DEGs were subsequently clustered into modules using hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance, Ward’s method, tree cut at height 20). Over-represented KEGG pathways66 and GO biological process terms22 were identified using Enrichr (FDR < 0.05). To evaluate intragroup variability, module expression for each sample was calculated as the mean expression of all scaled log-transformed normalized counts (given by the edgeR cpm function, corrected for the percentage of ribosomal RNA using the limma function removeBatchEffect after log-transformation).",
        "RNA in situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of Lgr5, Abca1 and Areg (Advanced Cell Diagnostics), in intestinal tissues at steady state and after irradiation. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded SI Swiss rolls were sectioned at 5 μm depth and were captured in MiliQ water using Superfrost gold slides. The RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent v2 Assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, the paraffin sections were baked for 1 h at 60 °C in the HybEZ Oven, then deparaffinized in xylene and washed in 100% ethanol. RNAscope hydrogen peroxide was used to block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides at room temperature for 10 min and RNAscope 1× target retrieval was performed at 100 °C for 15 min. The slides were then incubated with RNAscope Protease Plus for 30 min at 40 °C in the HybEZ Oven. Lgr5 (C2) and Areg (C3) probes were diluted in Abca1 (C1) probe at a 1:50 ratio, the mix was added to the slides and baked for 2 h at 40 °C in the HybEZ Oven. The hybridization was done for AMP1, AMP2 and AMP3 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The Abca1 signal was developed using TSA Vivid Fluorophore kit 570, Lgr5 using Fluorophore kit 520 and Areg using Fluorophore kit 650 (Tocris). Finally, the counterstaining with DAPI was performed for 30 s at room temperature and the slides were mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade mounting medium (ProLong Antifade reagent; Invitrogen) and scanned with the Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) using a ×20 air objective. Images were processed using Fiji/ImageJ (NIH).",
        "Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, paraffin embedded and sectioned (5 µm). For immunohistochemical analysis, the sections were deparaffinized in xylene and then rehydrated with graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked using 3% H2O2 (Scharlau) in methanol for 1 h. Antigen retrieval was performed using either 1 mM EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) or 10 mM Na-citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 121 °C for 20 min using 2100 Antigen Retriever. The slides were then washed with PBS and blocked using BLOXALL solution (BLOXALL Blocking solution; Vector Labs) for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS. Antibodies used were as follows: rat anti-BrdU 1:300 (Abcam), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 1:200 (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-CYP27A1 1:200 (Abcam), mouse anti-AREG 1:500 (Santa Cruz) and rat anti-B220 1:200 (BioLegend). The slides were washed four times with PBS and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (Vector Labs, 1:300), biotinylated goat anti-rat (Vector Labs, 1:300) or biotinylated goat anti-mouse (Vector Labs, 1:300) for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were washed four times in PBS and were incubated with the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit (Vector Labs) for 30 min. Staining was developed using DAB staining (DAB peroxidase staining kit, Vector Labs). The sections were counterstained with haematoxylin (Harris hematoxylin, Leica) and washed in tap water, dehydrated in increasing grades of alcohol and then with xylene and dried. The slides were mounted using permanent mounting medium (VectaMount, Vector labs). The slides were scanned using the Hamamatsu NanoZoomer Slide Scanner. Sectioning, H&E staining and DSS colitis and AOM–DSS tumour grading was performed in a blinded manner by the FENO (Morphological Phenotype Analysis) facility (Karolinska Institutet).",
        "Quantification of cCASP3+ and BrdU+ cells in the SI crypts was performed in a blinded manner using QuPath software. To isolate and quantify the distal SI, the first 10 cm of the proximal SI (starting from the pylorus) was removed and the rest of the distal SI was Swiss-rolled. Crypts (approximately 100 crypts per section) were delineated manually using the polygon or brush tool in QuPath. Crypts were selected if sectioned whole length (that is, not transversally cut). The numbers of DAB+ cells per crypt were quantified automatically using the ‘positive cell detection’ command in QuPath. The percentage of surviving crypts was calculated as the percentage of crypts with more than or equal to 10 BrdU+ cells out of all of the crypts quantified. The average number of cCASP3+ or BrdU+ cells per crypt was calculated as the average number of DAB+ cells in all of the crypts analysed in each section. The normalized percentage of surviving crypts (where indicated), was calculated by dividing the percentage of surviving crypts in each experiment by the average of the percentage of surviving crypts in the control group of each experiment.",
        "For quantification of LP CYP27A1+ cells in the crypt niche, an average of 48 intact crypts within Swiss rolls stained for CYP27A1+ at different  d.p.i. were first identified using NDP.View 2 (NanoZoomer Digital Pathology) software. DAB+ cells in the epithelial crypt base, transit-amplifying zone and LP surrounding each crypt were manually counted.",
        "Quantification of total CYP27A1 staining in SI and colon Swiss-rolls was quantified using ImageJ. In brief, scanned sections were converted to black and white using the ‘make binary’ command in ImageJ and the total mean grey value of the stained area was calculated. In the colour threshold tab, hue, saturation and brightness were adjusted to highlight only the DAB+ signal. Using the make binary command, the mean grey value of the DAB intensity was then calculated. The CYP27A1 intensity was calculated as the ratio of the mean grey value of the DAB intensity by the mean grey value of the total stained area (that is, area of the total Swiss-roll). The normalized CYP27A1 intensity was calculated by dividing the intensity of each timepoint (for example, post-irradiation) by the average of the intensity of the untreated control (for example, day 0).",
        "AREG quantification in the crypt and villus LP of the distal SI was performed in a blinded manner. For crypt AREG quantification, around 10 high-powered field (×40) images per mouse were exported and analysed using QuPath. In each image, crypts (4–15 crypts per field) were delineated manually using the polygon or brush tool as described previously. Overall around 100–125 crypts per mouse were quantified. Using the automated quantification tool, mean DAB intensity and the crypt area were quantified for each crypt. Mean DAB intensity for each crypt was normalized to its area, which was then used to calculate the average DAB intensity (AREG staining) per mouse. For AREG staining in villus LP, 10X images of the complete distal SI was exported and analysed using QuPath. In brief, the crypt regions were selected out and the analysis was focused only on the villus region. Using the cell detection tool, the mean DAB intensity and the area of individual selected cells was quantified. Using this, we quantified around 300–1,500 cells in the villus region/mouse. The mean DAB intensity for each cell in the villus LP was normalized to its area, which was then used to calculate the average DAB intensity (AREG staining) per mouse.",
        "Quantification of B220+ B cell follicles in AOM–DSS tumour samples was done blinded using QuPath software. In brief, the anti-B220 stained follicles irrespective of their sizes or staining intensity were selected and outlined using a polygon or brush tool in QuPath. The number of annotated B220+ follicles was counted and plotted.",
        "Tissue fixation, paraffin embedding, sectioning and staining protocols were performed as described above for immunohistochemistry with the following changes. For primary antibody detection, slides were incubated in PBS with rabbit anti-OLFM4 (1:300, Cell Signalling), rat anti-BrdU (1:300, Abcam) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) AF555 (1:5,000, Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C in darkness. After primary antibody incubation, the slides were washed with PBS and stained with goat anti-rabbit AF488 (1:500, Invitrogen), donkey anti-rat AF647 (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 90 min at room temperature in darkness. After secondary antibody staining, the slides were washed with PBS and nuclei were stained with DAPI (1 µg ml−1) for 30 min and subsequently washed with PBS. Mounting was performed using Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium (Vectashield). Fluorescent-stained slides were imaged using the LSM880 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Quantification of BrdU+Olfm4+ and Olfm4+ cells from 20–30 ileal crypts per mouse was performed using the Cell Counter plugin in Fiji/ImageJ (NIH). WGA staining was used to differentiate the crypt niche and the TA zone.",
        "SI organoids were grown in ENR or NR medium supplemented with DMSO, GW3965 (1 μM), with the medium changed every second day. On day 5, organoids were lysed in RIPA buffer with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1× PhosStop (Roche) phosphatase inhibitors. Cells were sonicated, centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm, and the cleared lysates were measured using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). The samples were run on 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 20 ng μl−1 protein loaded per well and the Precision Plus Protein All Blue Standards (Bio-Rad, 1610373EDU) as a molecular mass marker. Gels were blotted onto PVDF membranes, followed by blocking in 5% non-fat dry milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000), rabbit polyclonal phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000), and mouse monoclonal Vinculin (Sigma-Aldrich, V9131, 1:1,000). HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:5,000) or anti-mouse (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000) were used as secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Signal was detected using the Pierce SuperSignal West Pico Plus reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visualized on the BioRad luminescence detector. Densitometry was performed using the software Image Lab.",

Tissues were transferred to RLT Plus buffer (Qiagen) + 2% β-mercaptoethanol and lysed by bead-beating (Precellys) and stored at −80 °C till RNA extraction. Intestinal crypts and organoid cell suspensions were incubated in RLT Plus buffer (Qiagen) + 2% β-mercaptoethanol and stored at −80 °C before RNA extraction. RNA isolation was performed using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer instructions and was quantified using the Nanodrop. For RNA extraction from cells sorted directly into Trizol (Life technologies) or resuspended in Trizol after sorting, sorted cells were mixed well in Trizol and incubated for 5 min at room temperature and stored at −80 °C until further processing. For RNA extraction, samples were thawed at room temperature and an appropriate amount of chloroform (Fisher Scientific) was added and mixed by vortexing it well followed by 2–3 min incubation at room temperature and then centrifuging at 12,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase containing the RNA was carefully transferred to new Eppendorf tubes and 1 µl of Glycoblue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to each of the samples, which were then mixed by flicking; an appropriate amount to isopropanol was then added to each sample and the samples were mixed well. The samples were then incubated for 1 h at −80 °C followed by centrifuging at 12,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The samples were then washed in 70% cold ethanol by centrifuging at 12,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. Excess ethanol was removed and the samples were air dried until all of the residual ethanol was removed. The samples were resuspended in an appropriate amount of nuclease-free water (Life Technologies) and were quantified using the Nanodrop.

All of the patients signed informed consent forms approved by the institution (Cómite de ética de la investigación de CLC, O22019AA) and the procedures were performed according to human experimental and clinical guidelines. Patients undergoing surgery for tumour resection had to be older than 18 years old and not have received chemotherapy or neoadjuvant therapy before total or partial colectomy. Tumour staging was classified according to the TNM classification (The Union for International Cancer Control; UICC). Immediately after surgery, samples of fresh tumour and healthy intestinal mucosa (at least 10 cm away from tumour) were macroscopically selected. Biopsy-size samples of tumour and healthy tissue were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded for a tissue microarray (TMA) construction and immunohistochemistry analysis.",
        "For TMA generation, TMAs were assembled from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using a 0.6-mm-diameter punch (Beecher Instruments). The arrays encompass 14 tissue cores from colonic tumours and healthy tissue derived from 11 patients. Moreover, two cores from kidney tissue were used (for orientation purposes). Using a tape-transfer system (Instrumedics), 2 μm sections were transferred to glass slides and analysed using immunohistochemistry (IHC).",

The standard Seurat v.3.1.3 protocol was used to analyse these datasets. Cells with a number of expressed genes of <200 and >10,000 were first filtered out. Genes expressed in at least one cell were retained. Preprocessing, normalization and scaling of the data were carried out using inbuilt Seurat functions. Later, a graph-based clustering approach was used to identify subpopulations of cells and also to optimize the clustering approach to get finalized clusters at resolution 0.5. A list of markers genes for these clusters was obtained and used to further characterize the subpopulations. Furthermore, for the GSE117783 dataset, we analysed the crypts and whole epithelial cells separately. In the crypts sub-dataset, we merged all of the irradiated and normal cells from different clusters together and carried out differential expression analysis using Wilcox tests between the irradiated (cells in bulk) versus normal (cells in bulk) condition.

    "title": "Environmental eustress promotes liver regeneration through the sympathetic regulation of type 1 innate lymphoid cells to increase IL-22 in mice. extremely important for restoring homeostasis after liver injury. Although clinical observations have revealed an association between psychological stress and the liver, whether stress has a causal influence on the liver regeneration remains markedly less defined. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Rearing rodents in an enriched environment (EE) can induce eustress or positive psychological stress. Herein, EE-induced eustress was found to significantly enhance the ability of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy or carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury based on the more rapid restoration of liver/body weight ratio and the significantly increased number of proliferating hepatocytes in EE mice. Mechanistically, the cytokine array revealed that IL-22 was markedly increased in the regenerating liver in response to EE. Blockade of IL-22 signaling abrogated the enhanced liver regeneration induced by EE. Group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), including type 1 ILCs (ILC1s), have been identified as the major sources of IL-22 in the regenerating liver. EE housing led to a rapid accumulation of hepatic ILC1s after partial hepatectomy and the EE-induced enhancement of liver regeneration and elevation of IL-22 was nearly eliminated in ILC1-deficient Tbx21-/- mice. Chemical sympathectomy or blockade of beta-adrenergic signaling also abolished the effect of EE on ILC1s and attenuated the enhanced liver regeneration of EE-housed mice. CONCLUSION: The study findings support the brain-liver axis and suggest that environment-induced eustress promotes liver regeneration through the sympathetic nerve/ILC1/IL-22 axis.

        "Cancer is a leading cause of death and remains a major human health concern worldwide.[1] In 2000, Hanahan and Weinberg[2] first proposed the hallmarks of cancer, which were updated to encompass 14 characteristics in 2022.[3] The integrative concept embodied in the hallmarks of cancer helps distill this complexity of cancer into a logical science and fully understand the mechanisms of cancer progression. It is not surprising that the core conceptualization behind the hallmarks continues to resonate, though new evidence emerges. Notably, an emerging hallmark of cancer that is garnering increasing attention is the interplay between the nervous system and cancer.[4] A growing body of experimental evidence is reinforcing this connection and its various aspects, from the systemic effects of tumors on nervous system functionality to local remodeling of tissue innervation by tumors, as well as the modulatory effects of the nervous system on tumor phenotypes—topics that have been extensively reviewed.[4567] Consequently, a burgeoning field known as “Cancer Neuroscience” has been established, inviting multidisciplinary collaboration to further investigate the interactions between cancer and the nervous system.[5,6]",
        "The nervous system is typically characterized as a signaling network that regulates the development, plasticity, homeostasis, and regeneration of various organs and tissues.[8] By connecting organs to the central nervous system (CNS), nerves are essential to the body’s internal communication and proper physiological regulation. Given that the nervous system oversees numerous functions of the human body in both health and disease, it is reasonable to hypothesize that co-opted neuronal signaling circuits within cancer cells represent a distinctive and pivotal regulatory mechanism that modulates tumor development and malignant progression.[9,10] However, it is surprising that it takes such a long time to uncover and fully clarify the crosstalk between the nervous system and cancer. Remarkably, over the past decade, a growing body of evidence suggests that the nervous system plays a central role in cancer pathogenesis, while also indicating that tumors can influence the formation and functionality of the nervous system in return.[6,7,11]",
        "Various types of neural–cancer connectivity have been demonstrated, encompassing both direct and indirect communications that drive tumor initiation and progression.[7,12,13] For example, studies have revealed that neurons could interact with cancer cells directly,[14,15] and the CNS could regulate the progression of cancers via the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which mainly includes sympathetic nerves, parasympathetic nerves, and sensory nerves.[16,17] In addition, studies also revealed that neural progenitors from the CNS could infiltrate into tumors and drive neurogenesis and promote tumor growth.[18] Notably, a study indicated that cancer stem cells are capable of generating neurons, including sympathetic and parasympathetic types, which can integrate into the nervous system within cancerous tissues, thereby regulating cancer development and progression.[19]",
        "More importantly, neurotransmitters serve as key messengers that facilitate a broad range of signaling between nervous system cells and target cells through their binding to specific neurotransmitter receptors (NRs).[20,21] An increasing number of studies have suggested that NRs participated in tumor development in diverse ways and emerged as potential targets for cancer treatments.[202122] In this review, we will provide an update on the current state and future directions of NRs in cancer neuroscience. Additionally, we aim to identify significant advances and unresolved questions in this field while exploring potential targets and mechanisms to overcome challenges in clinical cancer therapy.",
        "Neurotransmitters are chemicals that help signals travel from the nervous system to peripheral targeted organs or tissues, which play important roles in governing the whole body including uncontrolled cancers. Based on different chemical structures and properties, neurotransmitters are classified into five categories [Figure 1][21]: (1) acetylcholine (ACh); (2) amino acids, including glutamate, aspartate, glycine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); (3) biogenic amines, that consists of dopamine, norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]); (4) neuropeptides, including but not limited to neuropeptide Y (NPY), substance P (SP), neurotensin, endorphin, vasopressin and many others; and (5) others such as nitric oxide (NO) and carbonic oxide (CO).",
        "Classification of neurotransmitters. Based on different chemical structures and properties, neurotransmitters are classified as five categories: acetylcholine, amino acids, biogenic amines, neuropeptides and others. GABA: Gamma-aminobutyric acid.",
        "Different neurotransmitters are associated with specific NRs, while NRs are coded by more than 200 genes, as detailed in Table 1.",
        "Neurotransmitters and corresponding NR coding genes.",
        "E: Epinephrine; 5-HT: 5-Hydroxytryptamine; NRs: Neurotransmitter receptor; NE: Norepinephrine.",
        "As important signaling receivers, an increasing body of studies have revealed that NRs are not only widely expressed in multiple types of cancer cells, but also contribute to cancer initiation, development, angiogenesis, and metastasis via different mechanisms.[16,23,24] In addition, the distribution of NRs is observed in diverse immune cells and NRs participate in the regulation of immune function as well.[25,26] The expression patterns and quantitative distribution of NRs exhibited significant heterogeneity across various tumor types, potentially dictating their neuroregulatory functions. This neuroimmune axis, mediated through the nerve–neurotransmitter–NR signaling pathway, exerts bidirectional regulatory effects on both malignant cells and immune cell populations, thereby reciprocally modulating tumorigenic progression and cancer development.",
        "In summary, four key interactions among cancer cells, neurotransmitters, and NRs are uncovered [Figure 2]: (1) Synaptic communications. Studies have verified that neurons could form synaptic communications with cancer cells directly, and receive neurotransmitters at the same time.[14,15,27,28] (2) Autocrine pathway. Cancer cells can synthesize and secrete neurotransmitters, which in turn can bind to the NRs on their own surfaces.[21,29,30] (3) Paracrine pathway. PNS is widely distributed through the whole body including tumors, and tumors could invade into nerve fibers as well. Therefore, neurotransmitters secreted from PNS or derived from blood will act on cancer cells directly; (4) Systemic neural–cancer interactions.[12,31,32] Neurotransmitters could travel to cancer cells via the circulation system. Also, tumors could be regulated by the nervous system–immune system–tumor axis since numerous studies have suggested that the proliferation and function of immune cells are regulated by neurotransmittrs.[20,25,33,34] As a result, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) was changed by neurotransmitters and NRs indirectly.",
        "The intricate interplay between cancer cells, neurotransmitters, and NRs can be categorized into four principal mechanisms: (A) Direct synaptic communication established between neuronal projections and malignant cells; (B) Autocrine signaling mediated by cancer cell-derived neurotransmitter synthesis and subsequent binding to NRs on the same cellular population; (C) Paracrine regulation through neurotransmitter release from the PNS or systemic circulation directly targeting neoplastic cells; and (D) Indirect modulation via the tripartite nervous system–immune system–tumor axis, which orchestrates complex tumor microenvironment regulation. NRs: Neurotransmitter receptors; PNS: Peripheral nervous system.",
        "Neurotransmitters and NRs play a crucial role in regulating the growth and apoptosis of cancer cells via multiple pathways. For example, in CNS tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM), glutamatergic neuronal activity stimulates proliferative signaling through paracrine mitogens released by neurons, in a neuronal activity-dependent manner.[14,35,36] In addition, neurons could promote GBM growth by generating synaptic communication with glioma cells and activating glutamate receptors of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) subtype directly.[15,28] Also, the co-culture of neurons and glioma cells causes a significant increase in cancer cells, which can be explained by the effects of neurotransmitters such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).[27]",
        "Emerging evidence demonstrates that distinct NR subtypes exert divergent regulatory effects on oncogenic processes, particularly in modulating cancer cell proliferation and apoptotic pathways. Notably, extensive research has established that β-adrenoceptor (β-AR) activation serves as a critical molecular switch, orchestrating pro-tumorigenic signaling cascades that enhance cellular proliferation while concurrently suppressing programmed cell death mechanisms in malignant cells.[373839] It largely contributed to the important role of β-AR in stress and emotion regulation, while strong connections between chronic stress/depression and tumor progression have been verified.[40414243] The potential mechanisms underlying the tumor-promoting roles of β-ARs mainly contributed to the increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and activation of protein kinase A (PKA), thereby activating downstream targets such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB).[39]",
        "For dopamine receptors (DRs), conflicting effects were observed. DRs agonists exhibited inhibitory effects on tumor growth in breast cancer, gastric cancer, and GBM.[444546] However, studies also revealed suppressive effects on cancer growth by blocking DRs.[474849] It may be partly explained that different subtypes of DRs have reverse effects in different types of cancers. Similarly, GABA receptors also exhibit complex effects on tumor growth.[50] In general, GABAA receptors attenuate the proliferation of cancer cells in brain tumors while promoting tumor growth in multiple tumors that are outside the nervous system, such as breast cancer and lung cancer.[51,52] GABAB receptors also exert double functions in tumor growth depending on the subtypes and types of cancers.[50,53,54]",
        "Compelling evidence has implicated 5-HT receptors (5-HTRs) as critical mediators in oncogenic processes through their tumor-promoting functions. Notably, pharmacological intervention with 5-HTRs antagonists has demonstrated significant therapeutic potential, primarily through dual inhibition of key signaling cascades, including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and β-catenin pathways, which are essential regulators of tumorigenesis.[55,56] As a well-known neurotransmitter of the cholinergic system, Ach and its receptors (AchRs) have been demonstrated to exert potent pro-proliferative effects in cancers.[29,57] AchRs were classified as the nicotinic AchRs (nAchRs) and muscarinic AchRs (mAchRs), while nAchRs belong to sodium channels and mAchRs belong to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Studies revealed that activation of nAchRs could promote tumor growth by inhibiting drug-induced apoptosis of cancer cells.[58,59] However, activation of mAchRs presented significantly inhibitory effects on tumor growth.[60,61] New drugs targeting AchRs are under investigation for clinical cancer treatments.[62] As the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, glutamate orchestrates a multitude of essential biological processes through an extensive receptor system encoded by 26 distinct genes. Accumulating experimental evidence has substantiated the oncogenic potential of glutamate signaling, demonstrating that both glutamate and its cognate receptors (GluRs) function as critical mediators in GBM pathogenesis and progression, as well as in the development of various other malignancies.[15,63,64]",
        "Neuropeptides, such as opioid peptides, NPY and BDNF, are involved in a wide range of biological processes including tumor development.[65,66] Studies have suggested that opioid receptors (ORs) play important roles in cancer cell proliferation, and tumor growth was significantly influenced by targeting ORs.[67,68] In general, activation of μ-OR and σ-OR could promote tumor growth while activation of κ-OR inhibits cancer proliferation.[67,69,70] In GBM, BDNF and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) could promote tumor growth via multiple pathways.[14,71,72] [Table 2].",
        "Effects of NRs on cell proliferation and apoptosis in cancers.",
        "5-HTRs: 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptors; BDNF: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; β-AR: β-adrenoceptor; BRCA: Breast cancer; cAMP: Cyclic adenosine monophosphate; GABA: Gamma-aminobutyric acid; GBM: Glioblastoma; GDNF: Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; mAchRs: Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors; mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin; nAchRs: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; NF-κB: Nuclear factor kappa B; OR: Opioid receptor; PKA: Protein kinase A.",
        "Cancers are well-known for their ability to dynamically invade and metastasize to create a more favorable niche to survive.[24] Both the inner nervous system and external nervous system of cancers facilitate the process of metastasis.[12,19,73] In addition, perineural invasion (PNI) was commonly observed in many different types of cancers which was associated with cancer invasion and metastasis.[74,75] It attributed to direct connections between cancers and nerves, and indirect pro-metastatic role of neurotransmitters from the nervous system.[24] Neurons and glial cells also contributed to cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In the colorectal cancer (CRC) study, Han et al[76] found that co-culture of Schwann cells with CRC cells promoted the proliferation and migration of CRC cells, and the Schwann cells could promote the metastasis of colon cancer. In GBM, Zeng et al[28] revealed that cancer cells could form pseudo-tripartite synapses with neurons and eventually promote brain metastasis.",
        "The metastatic regulatory functions of NRs exhibit significant subtype-specific heterogeneity, with distinct receptor families demonstrating divergent effects on tumor dissemination mechanisms. While ARs have been extensively investigated in the context of metastatic progression, their precise roles remain a subject of ongoing scientific debate.[41] For example, studies found that β-ARs enhanced cancer metastasis in breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma, and prostate cancer.[26,37,77,78] However, opposite results were reported that β-ARs inhibited cancer metastasis in breast cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, and GBM.[79808182] In addition, the effects of α-ARs on cancer metastasis were explored as well. Zhu et al[32] found that α2-AR agonists showed strong antitumor ability in multiple types of cancers by acting on immune cells. A study showed that dendritic cell (DC) migration was controlled by α1B-AR.[83] Zhao et al[84] implicated that cell mobility was inhibited by activating α1a-AR in HCC. However, opposite results were also observed that cancer invasion could be promoted by activating α-ARs in breast cancer[85] and HCC.[86] In summary, the intricate interplay among stress responses, NR signaling pathways, and metastatic progression constitute a complex regulatory network that necessitates comprehensive mechanistic elucidation. The observed experimental discrepancies may stem from the inherent biological heterogeneity across distinct cancer types, coupled with the differential expression patterns and functional diversity among NR subtypes.",
        "DRs also showed diverse effects on tumor metastasis in different cancers. For instance, the inhibitory effects of DRs on cancer metastasis were identified in breast cancer[87] and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC),[88] while reverse effects were observed in breast cancer, GBM, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and HCC.[48899091] Similarly, GABA receptors exert a double-edged role in cancer metastasis depending on the subtypes and types of cancers.[50,92,93] Interestingly, 5-HTRs, AchRs, and GluRs generally facilitate the metastasis of cancers.[28,29,56,94,95]",
        "Emerging evidence has established neuropeptide signaling pathways as critical regulators of metastatic processes, presenting them as viable therapeutic targets.[65,96,97] Notably, Wang et al[98] demonstrated that μ-OR activation through its agonist morphine promotes circulating tumor cell dissemination and enhances metastatic potential in bladder cancer by initiating μ-OR-mediated signaling cascades. Furthermore, comprehensive studies have revealed that the BDNF/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TRKB) axis serves as a key molecular driver of metastatic progression in both endometrial carcinoma and salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.[99,100] Most recently, investigation into neuropeptide function has identified SP as a potent modulator of breast cancer progression, where it facilitates tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis through activation of tumoral tachykinin receptor 1 (TACR1)-mediated oncogenic signaling pathways.[101]",
        "Cancer angiogenesis is indispensable for tumor progression and metastatic dissemination, orchestrated through a complex interplay of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic molecular regulators. Recent advances in neuro-oncology have revealed that neurotransmitter signaling pathways and NR-mediated mechanisms constitute essential components of the tumor angiogenic network, significantly contributing to vascular remodeling.[102,103] An increasing number of studies in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that E and NE stimulated angiogenesis via upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis by acting on their receptors expressed in tumor cells.[104] Notably, β-AR-mediated signaling has been extensively characterized across various malignancies as a potent enhancer of tumor angiogenesis, primarily through upregulation of pro-angiogenic cytokines including VEGF, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-8.[105] In the context of prostate cancer, mechanistic investigations have revealed that β2-AR deficiency in endothelial cells suppresses angiogenic processes by augmenting oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in subsequent inhibition of tumor growth.[106]",
        "Studies revealed that nicotine promoted angiogenesis via activation of α7 and α9-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs),[107] while the role of mAChRs in tumor angiogenesis is not well understood, and activation of mAchRs may result in complex effects on angiogenesis.[61,108,109] On the contrary, dopamine exhibits anti-angiogenic properties through DR2 in different cancers such as gastric cancer, breast cancer, and CRC.[45,110] As an excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate and GluRs were proven to be pro-angiogenic factors in breast caner, melanoma, lung cancer, and so on.[111112113] Activation of GABA receptors has been shown to inhibit cancer angiogenesis by diverse mechanisms.[103] 5-HT and its receptors have been implicated in promoting tumor angiogenesis by targeting endothelial cells or cancer cells.[114,115] Neuropeptides (such as SP, opioid peptides, and NPY) and their receptors have been identified as pro-angiogenic factors in cancers, and antagonists of neuropeptides could effectively inhibit cancer angiogenesis, which may be potential targets for clinical tumor treatments.[70,116,117]",
        "NRs have increasingly been recognized as pivotal regulators in the complex interplay between immune modulation and tumor immunoevasion strategies. Although this research domain remains in its dynamic phase of exploration, substantial empirical evidence has been systematically accumulated through comprehensive investigations spanning both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, complemented by emerging clinical observations.[20,32,118]",
        "NRs are part of a complex signaling network that links the nervous system with immune function. Some neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and NE, act through their receptors on immune cells to regulate immune responses. Studies showed that serotonin receptors are widely expressed on various immune cells, including T cells, DCs, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, and 5-HT can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses.[119,120] In addition, the application of 5-HT3 antagonists has shown enhanced activation of T lymphocytes and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting serotonin’s role in immune activation.[121] Similarly, studies revealed that dopamine could act on immune cells via D1 and D2 receptors and influence the activity of NK cells, T cells, and macrophages.[49,122,123] In cancer models, DRs agonists or antagonists have been shown to boost anti-tumor immunity, indicating that dopamine typically has an immunosuppressive effect in tumors.",
        "NRs play an increasingly recognized role in the regulation of immune responses, particularly in immune escape mechanisms. Immune escape is a critical barrier in the treatment of cancer. Neurotransmitter signaling—mediated by receptors for neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, NE, and opioids—can modulate immune cell functions, influencing both immune activation and suppression.[124125126127] For example, in the TME, elevated serotonin levels can contribute to immune suppression, particularly through the promotion of regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation, which dampens anti-tumor immunity. In cancers, serotonin signaling can enhance the recruitment of Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the tumor site, creating a suppressive environment that helps tumors evade immune surveillance. In addition, dopamine signaling through D1 and D2 receptors has been shown to suppress the cytotoxic activity of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).[123] Dopamine can also reduce antigen presentation by DCs, thereby impairing the initiation of anti-tumor immune responses. This contributes to the immune escape of tumors, particularly in stress-related contexts where dopamine levels are elevated. More importantly, NE signaling through β-ARs on tumor cells can promote immune evasion by upregulating immune checkpoint proteins such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1).[40] This enhances the ability of tumors to escape immune surveillance. In addition, NE promotes the recruitment of Tregs and MDSCs, which further suppress anti-tumor immunity. Interestingly, β-blockers, which inhibit the effects of NE, have been shown to enhance anti-tumor immunity and improve patient outcomes in breast cancer, lung cancer and melanoma.[39,41,128]",
        "The TME is a highly immunosuppressive milieu that helps tumors evade immune detection and destruction. Neurotransmitter signaling plays a significant role in shaping the TME by influencing the behavior of immune cells, stromal cells, and even the tumor cells themselves. Numerous studies have identified the important role of TME in tumor development, metastasis, drug resistance and so on.[129] Notably, deepening studies also illuminated the pivotal role of NRs in orchestrating the TME and its profound impact on tumor progression.[20,126] Apart from modulation of cancer angiogenesis in TME, NRs participated in regulating immune cell infiltration, proliferation, and dysfunction. These effects could be divided into two ways[7,20]: (1) Neurotransmitters derived from the PNS or cancer cells can directly interact with the NRs on immune cells, influencing their proliferation, migration, and overall function, and (2) neurotransmitters can bind to NRs on cancer cells, regulating the production of cytokines and chemokines, which in turn indirectly affects the proliferation, migration, and function of immune cells.",
        "It is noted that the effects of the nervous system on TIM have not been well-elucidated, and activation of different NRs may lead to distinctive results on TIM reconstruction.[126,130] For example, it is well-established that chronic stress can significantly induce suppressive TIM by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and β-AR signaling, leading to tumor progression and poor prognosis.[42,43] In addition, recent research suggested that β-ARs may function as a new immune checkpoint in immune cells, and activation of β-ARs in immune cells could induce T cell exhaustion and dysfunction, and inhibit immune cell proliferation.[25,131] However, opposite effects were identified that environmental eustress induced anti-tumor immunity and sensitivity to immunotherapy against HCC in mice by activating peripheral sympathetic nervous system (SNS)/β-ARs/c-c motif chemokine ligand (CCL2) axis.[132] Moreover, studies have reported that activation of α-ARs showed an anti-tumor effect by modulating TME.[32,133,134] Zhu et al[32] demonstrated that activation of α2-AR could increase infiltration and activity of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes, enhance polarization of M1 macrophages (anti-tumor macrophages), and reduce MDSCs formation. In summary, the influence of ARs on TME is still unclear, and it is imperative to delve deeper into underlying mechanisms to illustrate interactions among the HPA axis, NRs, and TME.[42]",
        "Other NRs also determine the shaping of TME in different types of cancer.[126] For example, researchers revealed that GABA receptor gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit pi (GABRP) could induce the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5) and CCL20 expression, thereby facilitating macrophage recruitment and tumor progression in PDAC.[135] Another study also verified that B cell-derived GABA could promote monocyte differentiation and limit anti-tumor immunity by inhibiting CD8+ T cell killer function.[136] The immunomodulatory effects of dopamine on immune cells exhibit dose-dependent, receptor subtype-specific, and cell-type-selective characteristics. It was demonstrated that dopamine activates naïve or resting T cells by D1, D2, D3, and D5 receptors, but inhibits activated T cells by D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 receptors.[122,137] In a physiological concentration, dopamine can inhibit the proliferation and cytotoxicity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro.[125,138] 5-HTRs seem to induce a suppressive TIM in lung cancer, PDAC, and CRC, which inhibitors of 5-HT would improve immune cells’ function.[124,139,140] Regarding AChRs, mAChRs can stimulate the immune response, while nAChRs primarily induce immunosuppression.[20]",
        "Neuropeptides and their receptors regulate TIM in various ways. SP receptors NK1R and NK2R antagonists could effectively inhibit tumor progression and metastasis by modulating immune cell infiltration and function.[141,142] In medullary thyroid cancer, researchers found that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) shapes an immunosuppressive TME by suppressing DC development, and CGRP receptor antagonist could offset CGRP detrimental impact on DC development in vitro.[143] Also, evidence has shown that ORs could influence immune cell infiltration and reshape TIM.[118,144] In previous studies, our team found that ORs were widely expressed in different immune cells, opioid receptor-like 1 (OPRL1) was highly expressed in monocytes, and OPRL1 may play a vital role in regulating the immune response and tumor-infiltrating macrophages in bladder cancer, liver cancer, PDAC and breast cancer.[145]",
        "In conclusion, NRs play a crucial role in regulating immune responses and can significantly influence immune activation and immune escape [Figure 3]. Experimental data from both preclinical and clinical studies support the idea that neurotransmitter (such as serotonin, dopamine, NE, and opioids) signaling pathways can modulate immune cell activity, potentially promoting either immune activation or immune evasion through corresponding NRs. The growing interest in neuroimmunology highlights the potential for targeting NRs as part of novel immunotherapies, particularly in cancer. As research advances, understanding the detailed mechanisms by which NRs affect immune responses could lead to more effective strategies for overcoming immune evasion in cancer.",
        "Effects of neurotransmitters and NRs on cancer malignant behaviors. Diverse interactions among cancer, neurotransmitters and NRs are identified. (A) Activation of different NRs leads to different effects on cancer proliferation and apoptosis; (B) Neurotransmitters from the nervous system or tumor could regulate the process of cancer metastasis by acting on different NRs; (C) Neurotransmitters and NRs have also been identified as one of the major contributors to cancer angiogenesis; (D) Deepening studies also illuminated the pivotal role of NRs in orchestrating the TME. NRs participated in regulating immune cells infiltration, proliferation and dysfunction. NRs: Neurotransmitter receptors; TME: Tumor microenvironment.",
        "ARs mainly consist of α and β receptors which include nine subtypes. Numerous studies suggest that complex connections exist between ARs and tumor development, as ARs are implicated in various physiological processes, including stress, anxiety, and depression.[42,43,146] However, different subtypes perform distinctive effects on cancer progression. A few studies implied that alpha-1A adrenergic receptor (ADRA1A) may be a tumor suppressor gene in HCC.[84,147] In GBM, researchers found that genetic knockout of ADRA1B or its specific blockade using α1/α1B adrenergic antagonists could significantly suppress growth and promote differentiation of GBM.[148] Another study revealed that low expression levels of ARDA1A, ARDA1B, and ARDA1D were significantly associated with a favorable overall survival in gastric cancer.[149] Interestingly, activation of α2-ARs seems to effectively inhibit multiple tumor development.[32,150] However, it is noted that dexmedetomidine, an agonist of α2-ARs, has dual effects on tumor progression in different types of cancers.[85151152153]",
        "A substantial number of studies have focused on the correlations between β-ARs and cancer, with particular emphasis on β2-AR.[252639404180105132] As extensively documented in previous studies, psychophysiological stressors—encompassing chronic stress, acute stress, anxiety, depression, and diverse emotion-related responses—demonstrate intricate bidirectional interactions with both the HPA axis and β-AR signaling pathways, collectively contributing to tumor pathogenesis. Nevertheless, substantial scientific ambiguity persists within this field, as paradoxical outcomes have been consistently reported following β-AR activation across various cancer models, suggesting context-dependent regulatory mechanisms that warrant further investigation.[37404181154155156] For example, it is well established that exercise, as a form of acute stress, is intrinsically linked to what can be described as a “healthy lifestyle”. In addition, regular physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of various types of cancer.[157] Studies have suggested that secretion of E and NE derived from exercise will mobilize the immune system through β-ARs thereby suppressing tumor progression.[154,158] However, other studies have also demonstrated that E and NE promote tumor growth and metastasis by activating β-ARs on cancer cells and immune cells.[25,128] In contrast to exercise, chronic stress increases baseline levels of E and NE both in circulation and within tumors, which contribute to tumor progression and potentially suppress anti-cancer immune responses via β-ARs.[159]",
        "Several studies have investigated the clinical impact of β-blockers on cancer outcomes. While these studies are still evolving, the evidence suggests potential benefits for various cancer types. In breast cancer, a phage Ⅱ randomized trial identified that one week of β-blockade with propranolol reduced intratumoral mesenchymal polarization and promoted immune cell infiltration in early-stage surgically-resectable breast cancer.[160] These results support the application of β-blockade in inhibiting progression of breast cancer. In NSCLC, Nilsson et al[161] found that combinations of β-blockers significantly abrogate epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor resistance and improve the prognosis of patients. Similar anti-tumor effects of β-blockers have also been reported in CRC and prostate cancer.[162] Therefore, the use of β-adrenergic receptor blockers in cancer therapy represents an exciting and emerging area of research. Although more robust and large-scale clinical trials are needed, β-blockers hold promise as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of various cancers, particularly when combined with immunotherapies and other conventional cancer treatments. With ongoing research, β-blockers may become an integral part of personalized cancer treatment strategies.",
        "In summary, ARs exhibit multifaceted regulatory roles in oncogenesis and tumor progression, emerging as potentially transformative therapeutic targets in clinical oncology, as evidenced by a substantial body of preclinical and clinical research. While the precise contributions of α-AR and β-AR subtypes to tumorigenesis remain subject to ongoing scientific debate, recent investigations have revealed profound connections between adrenergic signaling and tumor immunomodulation. Particularly noteworthy is the therapeutic potential demonstrated by α2-adrenergic agonists and β2-adrenergic antagonists in preclinical models, suggesting their promising clinical utility for enhancing cancer prognosis through immune-mediated mechanisms.[32,38] Furthermore, it is important to recognize that additional experimental and clinical data are needed to clarify the mechanistic roles of ARs in influencing cancer and the immune system.",
        "As seven-transmembrane GPCRs, DRs include five different subtypes. Studies revealed that DRD1 could activate both GPCR-mediated and GPCR-independent pathways.[123,163] GPCR-mediated pathways include (1) the cAMP/PKA pathway, (2) the activation of phospholipase C, and (3) the extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK) signaling pathway. In addition, DRD1 can activate the serine-threonine kinase (Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) cascade through receptor tyrosine kinase. Moreover, nuclear responders of DRD1 cellular pathways also include the modulation of histone H3 and cyclic-AMP response binding protein (CREB) activity. These complex signaling pathways result in complex effects of DRD1 on the development of different cancers. DRD1 showed antitumor effects in NSCLC,[164] breast cancer,[123] and PDAC,[165] and pro-tumor effects in GBM,[48] melanoma,[166] HCC,[89] and breast cancer.[123] Opposite effects of DRD1 in breast cancer may determined by different molecular subtypes[167]. Targeting DRD1 with its agonists and antagonists has demonstrated anti-cancer activity. However, the heterogeneity of DRD1’s molecular roles and mechanisms in cancer warrants further discussion. Studies revealed that DRD2 antagonists such as domperidone and ONC201 (DRD2 and DRD5 agonist) exhibited antitumor efficacy in breast cancer and GBM.[167–168,169] However, DRD3 showed anti-tumor effects in HCC, and DRD3 agonists may be a promising strategy for HCC therapy.[170] Also, another study suggested that DRD3 favors the production of IL-2 by CD8+ T cells, promoting a more potent anti-tumor response in a melanoma mouse model.[171] Unlike DRD3 and DRD4 which contributed to chemo-resistance and cancer stem cell-like phenotypes, thereby facilitating the progression of GBM and HCC,[172173174] SKF38393, a kind of DRD5 agonist, significantly suppressed the growth of gastric cancer by inducing autophagic cell death.[175] In addition, DRD5 functions as a negative regulator of DRD2 signaling and influences tumor sensitivity to ONC201 in GBM[176] [Table 3].",

        "The GABA receptor family primarily comprises three subtypes: GABA-A, GABA-B, and GABA-C receptors, which are encoded by a total of 21 genes. GABA-A and GABA-C receptors are pentameric transmembrane ligand-gated chloride anion channels that mediate rapid phasic inhibitory synaptic transmission and tonic inhibition while GABA-B receptors are GPCRs consisting of two subunits: GABBR1 and GABBR2.[177,178] As mentioned above, GABA receptors exhibit complex and opposite effects on tumor growth,[5051525354] metastasis,[50,92,93] and cancer angiogenesis,[103] which depends on tumor types and subtypes of receptors.",
        "GABAergic signaling functions not only in the CNS but also in peripheral organs, immune systems, and tumors.[179,180] Remarkably, studies revealed that GABAergic signaling exerted a regulatory role in tumor progression, stemness, metastasis, and TME by influencing diverse pathways including cAMP pathway,[181] EGFR pathways,[182] AKT pathway,[183] mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) or ERKs pathways.[184] In addition, significant upregulation or downregulation of GABA receptors was commonly observed across different types of cancers compared with adjacent tissues, which indicated that GABA receptors may be potential therapeutic targets in cancers.[50] Studies have revealed that GABA receptors play key roles in regulating tumor growth,[185] drug resistance,[186] sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and so on.[54,136] In general, GABAergic signaling inhibits the progression of tumors (such as GBM, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and CRC) by downregulating downstream signaling pathways such as cAMP-PKA pathway, cAMP-ERK pathway and GSK3β-NF-κB pathway; on the contrary, oncogenic GABAergic signaling promotes tumor growth and metastasis via stabilizing β-catenin, activating EGFR, ERK and AKT signaling pathways, and inhibiting CD8+ T cell function and eliciting IL10+ anti-inflammatory macrophages.[50]",
        "As the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian CNS, GABA also exerts important functions in non-neuronal processes, such as inflammatory effect,[187] immune-modulatory effect,[188] anti-oxidant effect,[189] and tumor-promotion effect. Zhang et al[136] identified that GABA, synthesized and secreted by activated B cells and plasma cells, could promote monocyte differentiation into anti-inflammatory macrophages and inhibit CD8+ T cell killer function by binding with GABA-A receptor in monocytes. Likewise, Huang et al[54] showed that tumor-derived GABA could activate the GABA-B receptor to inhibit GSK-3β activity, leading to enhanced β-catenin signaling, while GABA-mediated β-catenin activation both stimulated tumor cell proliferation and suppressed CD8+ T cell intratumoral infiltration. The tumor-promotion effect of GABA has also been identified in CRC, breast cancer, and PDAC.[52,93,135] In conclusion, targeting GABA may be a promising treatment for reshaping TIM and inhibiting tumor growth [Table 4].",

        "5-HTRs are classified into seven different families based on the genetics and signaling mechanisms, and all 5-HTRs are GPCRs, except for the 5-HTR3, which functions as a ligand-gated channel.[190] The complexity of serotonergic signaling is evident in the activity of various 5-HTRs, which integrate multiple inputs into converging or diverging signals, ultimately resulting in a diverse array of physiological effects.[191] The importance of 5-HT and 5-HTRs in cancer has been gradually realized by researchers, and 5-HTRs and related agonists/antagonists showed effective therapeutic potential for cancers.[115,191,192] However, the role of 5-HT in cancer pathogenesis remains limited and contradictory, largely due to the diversity and tissue-specific distribution of 5-HTRs, as well as the complexity of serotonergic signaling.",
        "5-HT and 5-HTRs could regulate tumor growth by influencing multiple aspects, such as tumor immunity, TME, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and stemness.[120,193] Diverse signaling pathways were influenced by activating different 5-HTRs including PI3K/AKT pathway, tyrosine kinase (JAK)/ signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, Ras/MAPK pathway, β-catenin pathway, and PKA/monoamine oxidase a (MAOA) pathway.[191] It is noted that 5-HT and 5-HTRs play a unique role in tumor immunity and reshaping TIM.[120] Studies suggested that 5-HTRs are widely expressed in various immune cells and regulate the proliferation, differentiation, activation, immune response, and cytotoxic capability of immune cells.[194195196] In addition, 5-HT could influence the infiltration of immune cells and expressions of immune checkpoints in TME. For example, 5-HT reduced the effector capabilities of CD8+ T cells and increased the expression of PD-L1 in colorectal and pancreatic murine cancer models.[197] However, the dual roles of 5-HT in regulating antitumor immunity still require further studies to explore.",
        "Cancers originating in different tissues express different 5-HTRs, while different 5-HTRs lead to distinct effects in cancers. In HCC, 5-HT could promote HCC proliferation via the MAPK pathway through 5-HTR1B and 5-HTR2B.[198] In addition, 5-HTR1B and 5-HTR2B signaling facilitated autophagy of HCC by upregulating microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) β and autophagy-related effector proteins such as Beclin1.[199] For prostate cancer, 5-HT accelerated the proliferation of prostate cancer cells by binding to 5-HTR1A, 5-HTR1B, 5-HTR2B, and 5-HTR4 through pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling axis.[200201202] For cholangiocarcinoma, 5-HT could promote the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cells via 5-HTR1A, 5-HTR2A, 5-HTR2B, 5-HTR4, and 5-HTR6 signaling.[203] Studies also revealed that the proliferation of lung cancer cells was significantly inhibited by knocking down 5-HTR3A, and patients with higher expressions of 5-HTR1A and 5-HT1B exhibited more severely suppressive immune microenvironment.[121,124] In addition, research has identified key roles of 5-HTRs in regulating the development of breast cancer,[204] PDAC,[205] ovarian cancer,[206] melanoma,[207] GBM,[119] and so on. In conclusion, 5-HT and 5-HTRs affect tumor progression through various mechanisms, and targeting 5-HTRs or 5-HT shows promising potential in controlling tumor growth and increasing the effectiveness of ICIs treatments.",
        "AchRs are phylogenetically classified into two distinct families: nAChRs, which function as ligand-gated ion channels, and mAChRs, which operate as GPCRs, collectively encoded by over 20 distinct genes. Emerging evidence has revealed a functional dichotomy in tumorigenic regulation, with nAChR and mAChR subtypes demonstrating opposing effects on cancer progression through their distinct signaling mechanisms.[58596061] Nicotine, a well-known component derived from tobacco, has been identified to promote cancer cell proliferation and facilitate cancer genesis by activating nAchRs and downstream signaling pathways, which suggests that blocking nAchRs brings light to cancer therapy.[62,94,208] Most studies showed that nAchRs contributed to cancer progression, particularly those of α5 and α7 nAchR subtypes.[94208209210] Emerging evidence suggests that mAChRs exhibit multifaceted regulatory functions in oncogenesis, demonstrating context-dependent dualistic roles that encompass both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive effects. For example, activation of mAchRs presented significantly inhibitory effects on tumor growth in GBM and breast cancer.[60,61] On the contrary, in ovarian cancer, high expression of mAchRs was associated with reduced survival of patients.[211] The pro-tumor effect was also identified in breast cancer,[212] CRC, and lung cancer.[213]",
        "In summary, extensive research has elucidated the intricate regulatory networks linking ACh-mediated signaling pathways with neoplastic progression, positioning AChRs as pivotal therapeutic targets across diverse malignancies. Nevertheless, substantial scientific ambiguity persists regarding the precise functional roles of AChR subtypes in tumorigenesis, necessitating further mechanistic investigations to resolve these conflicting observations and establish definitive therapeutic paradigms.",
        "As the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS, glutamate acts in diverse functions through ionotropic GluRs (iGluRs) and metabotropic GluRs (mGluRs).[214] There are three major types of iGluRs which are named N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), AMPARs, and 2-carboxy-3-carboxymethyl-4-isopropenylpyrrolidine (kainate) receptors.[215] mGluRs are GPCRs and eight subtypes have been identified (mGluR1–8).[214] An increasing number of studies have uncovered the indispensable role of glutamate in cancer metabolism and tumor progression, while GluRs also perform diverse functions in cancer development as well.[15,63,111,112,214]",
        "Regarding iGluRs, expressions of NMDARs and AMPARs were detected in CRC, lung cancer, and breast cancers, and it was reported that iGluRs favored proliferation by influencing the Ca2+ influx or MAPK pathway.[216,217] The genetic knockdown of NMDARs such as NMDAR1,[218]\nNMDAR2A,[219] and NMDAR2B,[28] significantly reduced the cell proliferation of cancer cells. In addition, NMDARs or AMPARs antagonists (such as the selective NMDAR antagonist AP-5; the NMDAR antagonist MK-801, also known as dizocilpine) show potential in inhibiting tumor progression,[219,220] However, their negative side effects, such as memory impairment and psychotic behaviors, challenge the applications of iGluRs antagonists in the clinic. It is noted that NMDAR synaptic signaling plays a key role in not only GBM progression but also brain-metastatic breast cancer, which facilitates tumor growth and metastasis.[14,15,27,28] Glutamatergic neuronal activity stimulates proliferative signaling through paracrine mitogens released by neurons, in a neuronal activity-dependent manner.[14,35,36] In addition, neurons could promote GBM growth by generating synaptic communication with glioma cells and activating AMPARs directly.[15,28]",
        "Regarding mGluRs as therapeutic targets, studies have identified their potential as prognostic markers and treatment targets in certain types of cancer. For instance, in triple-negative breast cancer, cell proliferation was inhibited by either knocking down glutamate metabotropic receptor 1 (GRM1) or utilizing the mGluR1 antagonist BAY 36-7620.[221] In addition, mGluR1 has been suggested as a pro-angiogenic factor in cancers.[111,222] In melanoma, Wen et al[223] found that GRM1 overexpression is frequently observed, and the GRM1 signaling inhibitor riluzole has been identified as effectively suppressing tumor growth in clinical evaluations. Also, activation of the GRM1 enhanced angiogenic signaling to drive melanoma progression by activating AKT/mTOR/hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) pathway.[222] The pro-tumor effects of GRM3 were observed in breast cancer[223] and melanoma.[224]",
        "On the contrary, GRM4 was identified as an anti-tumor factor and significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in breast cancer[225] and osteosarcoma.[226,227] However, a study also verified that genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of GRM4 led to effective inhibition in tumor growth, and resulted in a strong antitumor immunity by promoting NK, CD4+ T, and CD8+ T cells toward an activated, proliferative, and functional phenotype mechanically.[228] For GRM6, our previous study hinted that high expression of GRM6 was significantly correlated with worse prognosis in HCC.[22] The pro-tumor effects of GRM8 were identified by inhibiting cAMP pathway and activating MAPK pathway in squamous cell lung cancer[229] [Table 5].",

        "Neuropeptides and their receptors have attracted lots of attention in recent years, and studies enlighten their key roles in regulating tumor progression and metastasis.[29,65,96,97,103,156,230] A newly published study showed that breast cancer cells could colocalize with perivascular meningeal macrophages and induce their expression of the prosurvival neurotrophin GDNF, while GDNF subsequently accelerated the tumor growth and leptomeninges metastasis. In addition, in GBM, studies identified that BNDF and GDNF could significantly promote tumor growth, metastasis,[230] and chemo- and radioresistance via multiple pathways.[14,71,72,231,232] Similar findings were also proved in gastric cancer[233] and PDAC,[234] that GDNF could facilitate the growth and metastasis of tumors. Other studies suggested that BDNF and its receptor TRKB accelerated cancer metastasis in endometrial cancer,[99] and salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.[100] In addition, in GBM, Li et al[235] found that activation of TRKB could upregulate downstream AKT-mTOR signaling and promote GBM growth in mice. Importantly, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy targeting TRKB has demonstrated remarkable clinical efficacy in controlling tumor progression in solid cancers, particularly HCC and PDAC. Therefore, TRKB may serve as a promising target for the development of novel therapies to treat solid tumors.[236]",
        "Other neuropeptides (such as opioid peptides and NPY) and their receptors also play important roles in tumor development, cancer angiogenesis, metastasis, and TME reconstruction via diverse mechanisms.[656667686970116117141142143237] For instance, the NPY family and their receptors are widely expressed in different cancer types and perform complex biological functions in cancer, while these findings reveal the peptidergic system’s high potential for cancer diagnosis and treatment.[238] Compelling evidence has unequivocally established that neuropeptide-mediated signaling pathways serve as critical regulators of intercellular communication within tumor ecosystems, with pharmacological modulation of their cognate receptors demonstrating significant therapeutic efficacy in tumor growth inhibition.[239] The emerging recognition of peptidergic receptors as promising molecular targets in oncology has opened new avenues for therapeutic intervention, underscoring the imperative for innovative translational research strategies to harness their full clinical potential.",
        "New findings in the last years have increasingly consolidated the emerging field of cancer neuroscience. In this review, we make a case for clarifying the multifaceted connectivity among tumorigenesis, and malignant progression and the nervous system, especially emphasizing the important roles of different NRs in cancer development and prevention. The exemplary studies presented herein illustrate the emerging view that NRs are profoundly influential, manifested in tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and resistance to drugs.[456102] In addition, NRs also regulated cellular metabolic processes and tumor microenvironment remodeling.[6,20,22,103] More importantly, an increasing number of basic and clinical studies have implied that NRs may be potential targets for cancer treatments, and corresponding agonists or antagonists have been identified effectively in controlling tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, trying to uncover deeper mechanisms and connections between NRs and cancer is of high clinical significance and translational value.[202122]",
        "Furthermore, we summarize an update on the current state and ongoing directions of NRs in cancer neuroscience. Crucial advances and unanswered questions in this field were pointed out, and potential targets and translational directions for overcoming obstacles in clinical cancer therapy were discussed as well. A better understanding of the role of NRs in cancer initiation and progression will complement our knowledge of organ–organ interactions. Some potential signaling pathways have been identified between NRs and cancer. For example, studies have shown the important roles of the HPA/β-ARs and SNS/β-ARs pathways in tumor progression and metastasis, while blocking these pathways could effectively inhibit tumor growth[36,39,40,80]; GABAergic signaling exerts a regulatory role in tumor progression, stemness, metastasis, and TME by influencing diverse pathways including cAMP pathway,[181] EGFR pathways,[182] AKT pathway,[183] MAPKs or ERKs pathways[184]; diverse signaling pathways were influenced by activating different 5-HTRs including PI3K/AKT pathway, JAK/STAT3 pathway, Ras/MAPK pathway, β-catenin pathway and PKA/MAOA pathway[191]; GluRs were identified to influence signaling pathways such as AKT pathway, MAPKs pathway and cAMP pathway; neuropeptides and their receptors are involved in multiple pathways including SMAD2/3-serpin family E member 1 (SERPINE1)-signaling axis, AKT pathway and GDNF/MUC21/RAC2 pathway.",
        "Balancing the specificity of NRs targeting treatments with the risk of neurological side effects is a central challenge and requires a multifaceted approach in drug development for cancer.[191,240] Advances in receptor subtype-selective drugs, allosteric modulation, targeted drug delivery, pharmacogenomics, and personalized medicine are key to improving the safety and efficacy of treatments for cancer. For example, drugs can be designed to preferentially interact with specific receptor subtypes or isoforms, thereby limiting the activation or inhibition of other receptors that could cause off-target effects. Also, advances in pharmacogenomics can provide a way to predict individual responses to NRs-targeting drugs.",
        "Also, the clinical translation of NRs targeting individualized tumor therapy represents an exciting, emerging frontier in precision oncology. Here are some methods to achieve individualized tumor therapy: (1) Select appropriate NRs agonists or antagonists based on the expression levels of specific NRs in the tumor. The quantification of these receptor expressions using immunohistochemistry or genomic profiling could enable the stratification of patients, ensuring that therapies are tailored to individual receptor profiles, thereby improving clinical outcomes. (2) For certain cancers, allosteric modulators or biased agonists may offer enhanced precision. (3) The localization of drug delivery to tumor sites using nanoparticles or targeted drug carriers holds great promise for individualized cancer therapy. These carriers can be engineered to specifically target tumors with NRs expression patterns, increasing the concentration of the drug at the tumor site while reducing off-target effects.[241]",
        "It is noted that challenges are clear and unsolved: (1) We need to better map the NRs-cancer interactome and connectome on multiple scales and levels. It is necessary to gain deeper insight into interactions between NRs and specific cancer entities. (2) Different NRs perform distinct effects on the same types of cancer, and even the same NRs have opposite influence in different types of cancer. Clarifying the complex mechanisms and contradictions will help us understand NRs and develop effective targets for treating cancer. (3) Conducting meaningful clinical trials and drug discovery based on fundamental findings are indispensable. In addition, exploring individual treatments depending on neuroscience-instructed cancer therapies will benefit and improve the prognosis of patients with cancer.",

        "The Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway plays fundamental roles in tissue development, homeostasis, repair, regeneration, and tumorigenesis.1,2 β-Catenin transcriptional activity is controlled by Wnt proteins. Once secreted with the help of the cargo protein Wntless (Wls), Wnt proteins bind to cell surface receptor Frizzled (FZD) and co-receptors low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6). This leads to inactivation of the destruction complex composed of APC-GSK3β-Axin and allows β-catenin nuclear translocation and target gene expression.2",
        "The Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway and the RSPO-LGR4/5-ZNRF3/RNF43 axis are well-known regulators of pericentral gene expression and in turn of metabolic liver zonation (LZ) and also contribute to liver regeneration (LR) after partial hepatectomy.3, 4, 5, 6 LZ is a function of the hepatocytes exhibiting differential gene expression based on their location along the portal-central axis of a hepatic lobule.7 Such heterogeneity allows hepatocytes located within each zone to perform specific metabolic, synthetic, and xenobiotic functions, improving efficiency through division of labor. LZ also allows compartmentalization of certain injuries such that the remaining cells could proliferate to restore liver mass and function.8 LR after partial hepatectomy (PH) is also a distinctive feature of an adult liver, which is evolutionarily conserved, and allows the remnant liver to grow after surgical resection.9,10 Mice with liver-specific knockout of β-catenin (β-catenin-LKO) or liver-specific double-knockout of LRP5 and LRP6 (LRP5-6-LDKO) have disrupted pericentral LZ as seen by loss of pericentral expression of glutamine synthetase, CYP2E1, and CYP1A2; and delayed LR due to impaired cyclin D1 expression.11, 12, 13, 14 Hepatic endothelial cells (ECs) are the main source of Wnt ligands in an adult murine liver.15, 16, 17 Like β-catenin-LKO and LRP5-6-LDKO, mice with EC Wls deletion (EC-Wls-KO) lack pericentral LZ and show delayed LR. While 19 Wnt ligands are expressed in various cell types of the liver, their distinct pathophysiological roles in vivo are less well understood.18 In murine livers, Wnt2 and Wnt9b are present at the central venous ECs and hepatic sinusoidal ECs near the central vein.19 PH induces a 45-fold upregulation in Wnt2 and 18-fold upregulation Wnt9b expression in ECs at 12 h.17 Upregulation of Wnt2 and Wnt9b is also apparent in other hepatic regeneration settings.20,21 While these correlative studies suggest roles of these two Wnts in the liver, conclusive proof requires direct genetic evidence.",
        "While mechanisms of LR have been studied for several decades, there are no targeted therapies available to stimulate LR in acute or chronic liver injuries. Since the Wnt-β-catenin pathway contributes to both LZ and LR, it is a promising candidate pathway for drug development for regenerative medicine.5,22,23 Recently FP+P-L61+3 (abbreviated FL6.13), a water-soluble tailored tetravalent antibody consisting of two pan-FZD paratopes and two anti-LRP6 paratopes was developed through rational design.24 FL6.13 promotes FZD-LRP6 clustering to stabilize receptor conformations compatible with robust β-catenin activation at nanomolar concentrations in both murine and human cell lines, organoids, and in vivo.",
        "Here, we analyzed liver cell-specific expression of Wnt gene transcripts across different species using an existing single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing database that allowed us to identify Wnt2 and Wnt9b in ECs.25 We generated Wnt2 and Wnt9b double floxed mice to breed to lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (Lyve1)-Cre mice and generated EC-Wnt2-KO, EC-Wnt9b-KO, and EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice. The EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice exhibited perturbed metabolic LZ as revealed using 100-gene single-cell spatial transcriptomics by Molecular Cartography, which was rescued by FL6.13. The EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice showed delayed LR after PH, which was rescued by FL6.13. FL6.13 also induced β-catenin-dependent pericentral gene expression and cell proliferation program, and successfully promoted LR in murine model of surgical resection and rescued delayed acetaminophen (APAP) overdose-induced liver injury, thus fulfilling a major unmet clinical need.",
        "Since the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway is important for liver function, we queried expression of various Wnt genes in different liver cells through a searchable scRNA sequencing database from cells within livers of various species.25 In the human dataset, 18 out of 19 WNTs were detected in various hepatic cell types (Figure S1). ECs were the predominant source of WNT2, WNT2B, and WNT9B, although the signal of WNT9B was weak (Figures 1A and S1). In monkey, WNT2, WNT2B, WNT3, WNT9A, and WNT9B were highly expressed among 16 detected WNTs (Figures 1A and S2). ECs expressed high levels of WNT2 and WNT9B, while WNT2B was mainly expressed by Kupffer cells. In the pig, 9 WNTs were detected (Figures 1A and S3). ECs in porcine liver also expressed very high levels of WNT2 and WNT9B. WNT2B was expressed at a very low level. In mice, 15 Wnts were detected, of which Wnt2 and Wnt9b were highest in ECs (Figures 1A and S4). Even in mice with NAFLD, Wnt2 and Wnt9b were still predominantly expressed in ECs, suggesting preservation of their expression even in pathological states (Figure S5). Altogether, as could be seen from analysis in multiple species (Figure 1A), ECs are uniformly the predominant source of Wnt2 and Wnt9b and only EC expression of Wnt2 and Wnt9b appears to be evolutionarily conserved.Figure 1Endothelial cell expression of Wnt2 and Wnt9b is evolutionarily conserved(A) Violin plots showing expression levels of WNT2 and WNT9B in human, monkey (male Cynomolgus macaques), and pig (female piglets) livers, and Wnt2 and Wnt9b in mice (C57BL/6) livers among different hepatic cell types, with highest expression evident in endothelial cells across species.

        "ECs are a heterogeneous population across the liver lobule.26,27 By using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimension reduction, we observed pericentrally zonated expression of Wnt2 and Wnt9b in humans (Figure S6) and mice (Figure 1B). Zonal expression of Wnt2 and Wnt9b was also confirmed in another murine single-nuclei RNA sequencing database (Figure S7). Consistently, Wnt9b was expressed mainly by central venous ECs, while Wnt2 was expressed more broadly by both central venous ECs and sinusoidal ECs (Figures 1B and S6).",
        "To further validate these observations, we applied Molecular Cartography (Resolve Biosciences), which allows 100-plex spatial mRNA analysis on wild-type C57BL/6 mouse liver. Genes encoding for various components of the Wnt pathway, and genes that are known to be zonated, were spatially resolved by Molecular Cartography (Table S3). We identified central-portal zonation of hepatocytes using location of zonated genes (pericentral: Glul, Cyp2e1; midzonal: Igfbp2; periportal: Cyp2f2) and also identified cholangiocytes through Cldn7 expression (Figure 1C). Of the 19 Wnts, only Wnt2 and Wnt9b were pericentrally zonated (Figure 1C). To confirm the cellular source of Wnt2 and Wnt9b, we mapped gene expression of cell-specific markers, such as Pecam1 for ECs, Lyz2 for macrophages, and Lrat for hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Wnt2 and Wnt9b predominantly colocalized with Pecam1, while some overlap was evident with Lyz2 and Lrat, confirming ECs to be the major Wnt2- and Wnt9b-expressing cells in zone 3 of the murine liver (Figures 1D and S8).",
        "Altogether, these data suggest spatially confined expression of Wnt2 and Wnt9b in ECs, which, along with Rspo3 from ECs and HSCs, might be instructing pericentral Wnt-β-catenin activity to contribute to metabolic LZ.28,29",
        "Wnt2flox/flox mice with loxP sites flanking exon 2 of the murine Wnt2 gene were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 as discussed in STAR Methods (Figure S9A). Wnt9bflox/flox mice and Lyve1-Cre mice were obtained from Jackson laboratories.17,30 Rosa-stopflox/flox-EYFP mice were bred to these strains to fate-trace the expression and activity of Cre-recombinase transgene. After strategic breeding (discussed in STAR Methods), we successfully generated EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice that were identified by the simultaneous presence of Cre, floxed Wnt2, floxed Wnt9b, and Rosa-stop alleles in the genomic DNA PCR (Figure S9B).",
        "While Lyve1 is mainly expressed by midzonal hepatic sinusoidal ECs in an adult murine liver, Lyve1-Cre recombines floxed alleles in both hepatic sinusoidal ECs and vascular ECs, likely due to expression of Lyve1 sometime during development in all ECs.16,17 To reconfirm, GFP expression in livers from EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO was seen in both hepatic sinusoidal and central venous ECs by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (Figures S9C and S9D).",
        "To examine the impact of Wnt2, Wnt9b, or combined deletion from hepatic ECs, we assessed serum of mice from each genotype for transaminases and examined hepatic histology. Liver transaminases and histology from all genotypes were insignificantly different from the controls (Figure S9E and not shown). Liver weight to body weight ratio (LW/BW) was around 22% and significantly lower in the EC-Wnt2-KO and EC-Wnt9b-KO mice when compared with the controls and was even lower in EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice, similar to previously reported hepatic genetic KO of various components of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway (Figure S9F).13,14,17",
        "Since loss of β-catenin or LRP5-6 from hepatocytes or Wls from ECs resulted in loss of Wnt-β-catenin target genes in pericentral zone, we next examined their expression in EC-Wnt2-KO, EC-Wnt9b-KO, and EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice. In males, by IHC and by western blot, single deletion of Wnt2 or Wnt9b led to partial but consistent loss of pericentral expression of GS, CYP2E1, and CYP1A2 (Figures 2A and 2B). Minimal difference in their expression was evident in females (Figures 2A and 2B). Interestingly, both male and female EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice exhibited complete loss of pericentral GS expression and had minimal residual CYP2E1 and CYP1A2 (Figure 2A). Lack of CYP2E1 and CYP1A2 led to absence of APAP metabolism to NAPQI and hence EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice showed normal serum transaminases compared with controls, which showed 20,000 U/L at 24 h after 450 mg/kg of APAP treatment (not shown). In fact, EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO phenocopied β-catenin-LKO, LRP5-6-DLKO, and EC-Wls-KO mice, proving that, among the 19 Wnts, Wnt2 and Wnt9b are sufficient for maintaining baseline expression of key pericentral hepatocyte targets of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway and their dual deletion cannot be compensated by other mechanisms (Figure 2B).Figure 2EC-derived Wnt2 and Wnt9b control expression of key β-catenin target genes in the baseline liver(A) Immunohistochemistry showing zonation of representative pericentral enzyme GS, CYP2E1, and CYP1A2 in representative male and female mice from age- and sex-matched littermate controls (Control), EC-Wnt9b-KO, EC-Wnt2-KO, and EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO.

        "Cyclin D1 is a β-catenin target gene that is mainly expressed in hepatocytes in the midzone of a quiescent liver. Like in various models of Wnt pathway disruption in the liver, cyclin D1 was decreased in both single and double KO mice in both males and females, but more profoundly in males and in DKOs (Figure 2B).13,14,17",
        "To evaluate zonation changes in-depth, we applied Molecular Cartography to study the single-cell spatial expression of 100 genes (Table S3). Two pipelines were used for the analysis of the control and EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice (Figure S10). First, to obtain the genetic signature at single-cell level, we used QuPath to outline single hepatocytes and obtained the expression of genes per cell. Comparable numbers of cells were obtained from control and DKO livers (Figure 3A). Next, using expression of 16 known zonated genes, a UMAP was generated, which identified six distinct hepatocyte populations (Figure S10). Clusters 1 and 2 represented hepatocytes with expression of pericentral genes, while clusters 4, 5, and 6 represented cells expressing periportal genes (Figure 3A). Intriguingly we observed a dramatic enrichment of cells in cluster 4, 5, and 6 at the expense of cells exhibiting pericentral genes in EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO, indicating an overall shift of gene expression from pericentral to periportal in these livers (Figure 3A).Figure 3Single-cell spatial transcriptomics profiling by Molecular Cartography reveals dynamic zonation changes in EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice(A) UMAP plots of single-cell transcriptomic analysis of Molecular Cartography data showing genetic clusters of hepatocytes from control and EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO livers based on expression of 16 zonated genes.

        "Next, to obtain the spatial signature, we divided the liver lobule evenly into nine segments (pericentral to periportal: S1 to S9) using landmark genes (Figure S10). Gene expression density (gene counts per area) were quantified within each zone and averaged across the defined pericentral-to-periportal regions thus allowing us to compare gene expression across the lobule using line plots (Figure S10). To combine the genetic signature and spatial signature, we then identified hepatocytes located within the nine segments based on their position (x and y axis) on the slides and applied this information back to the UMAP to track their localization (Figure S10). As expected, in controls, pericentral cells were seen mainly in clusters 1 and 2 and periportal cells in clusters 4, 5, and 6. In EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice, most pericentral and all midzonal and periportal cells were in clusters 4, 5, and 6, exhibiting periportal genetic signature (Figure 3B).",
        "We next visualized molecular cartography expression of specific pericentral Wnt targets (Glul, Lect2, Axin2, CIdn2, Cyp1a2, Oat, Cyp2e1, and Rgn) and of periportal genes (Fbp1, G6pc, Pck1, Gls2, Arg1, Ass1, Cps1, and Cyp2f2) (Figure 3C). Most pericentral Wnt-β-catenin target genes in hepatocytes were dramatically downregulated or absent in EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO livers, including Glul, Oat, Cyp2e1, Axin2, Cldn2, Cyp1a2, Cyp7a1, Lect2, Lgr5, Prodh, Rgn, Rnf43, and Tbx3 (Figures 3D and S11A), supporting these β-catenin-TCF4 targets to be under direct control of paracrine Wnt2 and Wnt9b ligands from the neighboring ECs. Intriguingly, not all pericentral genes were affected and paradoxically some genes, such as Alad, C6, Cpox, Cyp27a1, Gstm1, and Lrp5, were upregulated, suggesting their expression to be controlled by other pericentral regulators or may be a consequence of compensation to the Wnt-β-catenin pathway disruption (Figure S11B). Interestingly, we observed de novo ectopic expression of periportal genes in zone 3 either with concomitant decrease in their periportal expression (Fads1, C8b, Hsd17b13, Igf1, Pck1, and Pigr) (Figures 3E and S11C), without any change in their baseline periportal expression (Gls2, Cps1, Elovl2, Arg1, Cpt2, Cyp8b1, Lrp6, Ndufb10, Uqcrh, and Vtn) (Figures 3E and S11D), or with concurrent increase in their periportal expression (Ass1, Atp5a1, Cyp2f2, Fbp1, Igfals, and Sox9) (Figures 3E and S11E).",
        "To assess if such dynamism in the process of LZ was more global and not limited to one model, we queried expression of selected zonally expressed genes by Molecular Cartography in β-catenin-LKO, LRP5-6-LDKO, and EC-Wls-KO livers. All models showed similar alterations with gain of periportal gene expression in zone 3 hepatocytes along with alterations in their native zone 1 expression (Figure S12).",
        "Zone 2 hepatocyte proliferation has been shown to be at least in part driven by the IGFBP2-mTOR-CCND1 axis.31 Indeed, Igfbp2 and Ccnd1 were both expressed in midzone in the control liver, with highest expression of Ccnd1 in segment 4 and highest expression of Igfbp2 in segment 5 (Figure 3G). In EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice, Ccnd1 level was overall decreased (average fold change = 0.84, p = 1.00654 × 10−55), while Igfbp2 was marginally increased (average fold change = 1.09, p = 1.72255E-10). Importantly, there was decrease of Ccnd1 in midzone but an increase in pericentral hepatocytes along with an increase in Igfbp2 (Figures 3F and 3G). The loss of Ccnd1 from midzone in DKOs suggests its expression is also normally controlled by EC Wnt2 and Wnt9b and from midzonal Igfbp2, and the latter may become the dominant regulator in the absence of Wnts. High expression of Ccnd1 evident in periportal cells is a technical artifact due to inadvertent inclusion of Ccnd1-positive biliary cells during cell outlining by the QuPath. Midzonal expression of Pon1 showed a similar shift (Figure 3G).",
        "Collectively, we observe “periportalization” of the liver lobule in all Wnt-β-catenin pathway disrupted livers. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal changes in the expression of multiple zonated genes in hepatocytes in all zones upon elimination of Wnt2 and Wnt9b that is basally expressed only in zone 3 ECs, or β-catenin signaling that is active only in zone 3 hepatocytes, underscores the overall dynamic nature of LZ. Thus, LZ appears to be a net impact of both active transcription and repression of genes in the same cells.",
        "The Wnt-β-catenin pathway has also been shown to play an important role in regulating hepatocyte proliferation after PH. Loss of β-catenin or LRP5-6 from hepatocytes or Wls from ECs, resulted in decreased cyclin D1 expression in hepatocytes leading to notably lower numbers of hepatocytes in S-phase and decreased proliferation at 40 h, with eventual recovery at 72 h.13,14,17 To investigate the role of Wnt2 and Wnt9b from ECs in this process, we subjected male and female EC-Wnt2-KO, EC-Wnt9b-KO, and EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice to PH. Male EC-Wnt2-KO and EC-Wnt9b-KO mice exhibited a profound decrease in cyclin D1 (Figure 4A). This decrease was less conspicuous in females, likely due to basally higher cyclin D1 levels (Figures 2B and 4A). Importantly, like β-catenin-LKO, LRP5-6-LDKO, and EC-Wls-KO, cyclin D1 was barely detectable in the EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice in both genders, suggesting that the two Wnts are collectively required for normal cyclin D1 upregulation during LR (Figure 4A).Figure 4Hepatic EC-derived Wnt2 and Wnt9b contribute to normal liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy(A) A representative WB showing notably lower cyclin D1 level at 40 h post PH, especially in males in single KO of endothelial cell Wnt2 and Wnt9b, but a more profound decrease is evident in DKOs in both sexes.(B) IHC for cyclin D1 shows decreased staining at 40 h post PH in male EC-Wnt2-KO, EC-Wnt9b-KO, and EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice.

In controls, periportal and midzonal hepatocytes were cyclin D1 positive, while one to two layers of hepatocytes around the central vein remained negative (Figure 4B). In single KOs, cyclin D1-positive hepatocytes were concentric around the central vein except for one to two layers of hepatocytes immediately around the vessel (Figure 4B). In EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice, cyclin D1 was weak but more diffusely expressed. These observations suggest that the concentric pattern of cyclin D1 in the EC-Wnt2-KO mice may be due to reciprocal increase in Wnt9b in pericentral neighborhood and vice versa in the EC-Wnt9b-KO mice (Figure 4B). But their combined loss prevented such localization of cyclin D1. Unlike males, female single KO lacked any peculiarities in cyclin D1 levels or localization, and only DKO mice showed a dramatic decrease in cyclin D1-expressing hepatocytes (Figure 4B). To study the consequence of cyclin D1 decrease we compared LR in controls, single, and double KO livers at 40 h by Ki67, a marker of S-phase, and BrdU, an indicator of cell proliferation, injected to mice 5 h before euthanasia. Like cyclin D1, proliferating hepatocytes were mainly localized around the periportal and midzonal region in the controls. Single KO mice had sparsely positive cells, and DKO mice were completely negative for Ki67 and BrdU labeling at 40 h (Figures 4B and 4C). These observations were consistent in both genders. Therefore, there is a notable deficit in LR in EC-Wnt2-KO and EC-Wnt9b-KO mice, which is even worse in EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice phenocopying β-catenin-LKO, LRP5-6-LDKO, and EC-Wls-KO mice.13,14,17",
        "Since FL6.13, the tailored tetravalent antibody has recently been shown to engage the FZD-LRP6 receptor in the absence of natural Wnt ligands, we next investigated if it could activate β-catenin signaling and rescue both the pericentral gene expression or metabolic LZ as well as LR after PH in the EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO and in EC-Wls-KO mice.17 Four doses of control IgG or FL6.13 were injected into 8-week-old male KO or control mice every other day for a week as described in STAR Methods (Figure 5A). PH was performed on day 8 and the resected livers were processed for analysis. Regenerating livers were also harvested at 24 h post PH. Mice were given 1 mg/mL BrdU in drinking water throughout the study to label all proliferating cells during the process (Figure 5A). Pretreatment with FL6.13 restored pericentral expression of GS and pericentral and midzonal expression of CYP2E1 in both models (Figure 5B). FL6.13 was also efficient in inducing pan-zonal expression of cyclin D1 except in the most immediate one to two layers of pericentral hepatocytes (Figure 5B). Concomitantly, hepatocyte proliferation as seen by enhanced BrdU incorporation was evident in both groups of KOs at baseline (Figure 5B). At 24 h after PH, a profound increase in hepatocyte proliferation was observed in EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO and EC-Wls-KO mice by BrdU incorporation and LW/BW recovery, which was even greater than the control animals dosed with control IgG, suggesting rescue and even shift to the left in LR kinetics with FL6.13 (Figures 5B and 5C). This enhanced proliferation in response to FL6.13 in both KOs was associated with continued increase in cyclin D1 in most hepatocytes pan-zonally.Figure 5FL6.13 rescues liver zonation and liver regeneration in mice lacking Wnt secretion, specifically Wnt2 and Wnt9b from the endothelial cells, but not in mice lacking Wnt co-receptors LRP5-6 from hepatocytes(A) Study design showing dosing schedule of pan-Frizzled agonist FL6.13 or isotype control IgG administration to various mouse groups.(B) Representative IHC for β-catenin pericentral targets GS and CYP2E1, midzonal target cyclin D1, and indicator of cell proliferation BrdU, in baseline livers after four treatments of control mice with control IgG and four treatments of EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO, EC-Wls-KO, and LRP5-6-LDKO mice with FL6.13.

        "To address the specificity of the response by FL6.13, we next treated LRP5-6-LDKO mice lacking Wnt-co-receptors in hepatocytes.14 These mice have been shown previously to also phenocopy β-catenin-LKO in both lacking pericentral Wnt-β-catenin targets and delayed LR. When these mice were treated with FL6.13 (Figure 5A), there was no change in pericentral gene expression of GS and CYP2E1, which continued to be absent in these mice (Figure 5B). Similarly, FL6.13 was unable to restore either cyclin D1 expression or BrdU incorporation either at baseline or 24 h post PH (Figure 5B). This was also reflected by a deficient LW/BW at 24 h post PH (Figure 5C). This study shows the requirement of intact Wnt co-receptors for FL6.13 to stimulate the Wnt-β-catenin signaling in vivo.",
        "To characterize Wnt-β-catenin activation by FL6.13 in greater depth, we tested the effect of four doses of FL6.13, given every 48 h, on the wild-type mice, as described in STAR Methods. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, the mice were euthanized, and livers were processed for Molecular Cartography using the same set of probes (Table S3). Two pipelines were applied for analyses (Figure S13). Zonal distribution of hepatocytes was identified based on differentially expressed genes (Figure S14) and confirmed by tracing back the localization and zonation of hepatocytes on the slides (Figure S13). The genetic signature and spatial signature overlapped quite well on the UMAP for the current analysis, unlike the EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice that lacked Wnt-β-catenin target genes in zone 3 hepatocytes precluding overlap (Figure S13). Five different clusters were identified, which enabled reconstruction of the metabolic zones (pericentral: clusters 1 and 2; midzonal: cluster 3; periportal: clusters 4 and 5) (Figure 6A). A notable increase of the proportion of C3 and C4 was noted after FL6.13 treatment (Figure 6B), which was marked by the ectopic expression of pericentral Wnt target genes, such as Lect2, Cyp2e1, Rgn, Cyp1a2, Gstm1, and Cldn2 (Figures 6C and S15A). Interestingly, some pericentral genes were not induced by FL6.13 using spatial single-cell analysis, including transcription factor Tbx3,32 heme synthesis enzymes Alad and Cpox,33 bile acid synthesis enzyme Cyp27a1,34 and complement pathway gene C634 (Figure S15B). This indicated that FL6.13 selectively activates some but not all pericentral genes. Unlike de-repression of periportal genes in the EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice, there was no concomitant decrease in the expression of periportal genes, including complement pathway genes (C8b, Vtn), Fc receptor (Pigr), lipid metabolism gene (Hsd17b13), oxidative phosphorylation genes (Uqcrh, Atp5a1), gluconeogenesis genes (G6pc, Fbp1, Pck1), glutamine catabolism gene (GLs2), urea cycle genes (Arg, Cps1), and hormone (Igf1) (Figures 6C and S16A). Representative images from Molecular Cartography showed that FL6.13 induced an expansion of pericentral markers (Lect2, Cyp2e1, Rgn) to both midzonal and periportal regions, while the expression of periportal markers (Arg1, Ass1, Cps1) remained unaltered (Figure 6D).Figure 6Single-cell spatial transcriptomics profiling of FL6.13-treated control mice reveals dynamic changes in zonation and promotes regeneration after partial hepatectomy(A) UMAP plots of single-cell transcriptomic analysis of hepatocytes by Molecular Cartography showing gain of specific clusters in FL6.13-treated livers.(B) Stacked bar chart depicting distribution of various hepatocyte clusters showing specific gain of C3 and C4 after FL6.13 treatment (right bar) compared with controls (left bar).(C) Feature plots from Molecular Cartography analysis of specific representative genes showing ectopic expression of pericentral genes (Lect2, Cyp2e1, Rgn) in midzonal and periportal cluster after FL6.13 treatment (red) compared with controls (blue), while periportal genes (G6pc, Arg1, Atp5a1) continued to be expressed in these clusters and hence remained unchanged.(D) Molecular Cartography visualization of tissue section of the same genes as indicated in (C) showing ectopic expression of pericentral genes in midzonal and periportal regions, while periportal genes were unchanged after FL6.13 treatment.

        "We also validated some of these findings by qPCR. Indeed, most pericentral Wnt-β-catenin target genes, such as Glul and Axin2, were significantly induced by FL6.13 treatment, whereas periportal genes were not affected (Figures 6E and 6F). Not all pericentral genes were increased by FL6.13. Levels of Tbx3 and Lgr5 were unchanged after FL6.13 treatment (Figure 6E).",
        "To visualize zonation changes at the protein level, we stained pericentral markers (CYP2E1 and RGN) and periportal markers (CYP2F2 and PIGR) in control and FL6.13-treated livers. Expansion and ectopic expression of CYP2E1 and RGN was observed at the midzone and in the periportal hepatocytes after FL6.13 treatment, while areas of CYP2F2 and PIGR immunostaining were similar as controls and in periportal hepatocytes (Figure 6G).",
        "Altogether, these data indicate a selective and potent effect of FL6.13 in inducing expansion of most pericentral Wnt-β-catenin target genes but not at the expense of periportal gene expression.",
        "Since FL6.13 effectively promoted LR after PH in the EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO and EC-Wls-KO mice through stimulation of Ccnd1 expression, we next queried its impact on normal baseline liver after four doses of FL6.13 given every 48 h. A notable increase in Ccnd1 mRNA and cyclin D1 protein was observed after FL6.13 treatment (Figure 6H). Interestingly, induction of cyclin D1 was not evenly distributed across the liver lobule, but only around the periportal region (Figures 6I and 6J), like observations with another Wnt agonist and RSPO1.6,35 BrdU incorporation was significantly induced after FL6.13 treatment, indicating that periportal hepatocytes entered S-phase upon Wnt activation and cyclin D1 expression (Figures 6J and 6K). Collectively, FL6.13 could activate the hepatic Wnt-β-catenin pathway, induce expansion of pericentral metabolic LZ through midzone and even periportally, without impairing expression and localization of periportal genes, and while provoking proliferation of periportal and midzonal hepatocytes. These data also suggest that hepatocytes within different zones in the liver have distinct responses to exogenous Wnt stimulation.",
        "Considering the strong effect of FL6.13 in inducing hepatocyte proliferation, as a proof-of-concept for therapeutic intervention, we next investigated the effect of FL6.13 on LR using the PH model. Four doses of control IgG or FL6.13 were i.p. injected into 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice. PH was performed on day 8 and regenerating livers were harvested 24 h later. Mice were given 1 mg/mL BrdU in drinking water to label proliferating cells throughout the process (Figure S16B). In control IgG-treated mice, cyclin D1 was expressed mainly at the midzone at 24 h post PH, and very few hepatocytes were BrdU positive (Figure 6L). Pretreatment with FL6.13 induced dramatic expansion of cyclin D1 toward pericentral region and 6-fold increase in periportal BrdU incorporation (Figures 6L and 6M). Proliferative advantage led to accelerated LR and contributed to significantly greater recovery of LW/BW at 24 h (Figure 6N). These results demonstrate a potent effect of FL6.13 pretreatment in promoting LR leading to faster recovery of hepatic mass.",
        "To test the clinical applicability of FL6.13 to promote repair in a model of acute liver insult, we evaluated its efficacy in APAP overdose-induced hyperacute liver injury. APAP is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic, but it accounts for 46% of acute liver failure (ALF) in the United States.36 Patients with APAP overdose either progress to liver failure requiring transplant or may recover spontaneously. N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) is the only currently approved antidote but must be given early after APAP ingestion for its full efficacy, and the probability of developing ALF continues to increase over time with delay in NAC administration.37",
        "Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 fasted for 12 h were injected with 600 mg/kg APAP followed by a single dose of control IgG or FL6.13 at 12 h and mice were sacrificed at 48 h post APAP injection (Figure S17A). Surprisingly, mice treated with FL6.13 had higher mortality (Figure S17B), accompanied with 2-fold higher ALT level (Figure S17C). Negative effect of FL6.13 was seen as patches of necrotic areas by hematoxylin and eosin (Figure S17D). Severe gross and sinusoidal congestion was seen in the dead mice after FL6.13 treatment (Figures S17B and S17D). We next evaluated hepatocyte proliferation, which counteracts the injury to drive liver repair. APAP (600 mg/kg) has been reported to induce severe liver injury with mild hepatocyte proliferation during the recovery process.38 Indeed, in the control group cyclin D1 was weakly expressed only by the first layer of hepatocytes surrounding pericentral necrotic regions at 48 h post APAP. Hepatocytes were negative for Ki67 demonstrating lack of G1 to S-phase transition at this time (Figure S17D). Interestingly, FL6.13 treatment did not induce cyclin D1 and Ki67 at 48 h after APAP overdose (Figure S17D). Comparable immune cell infiltration, important for phagocytosis of necrotic cells and subsequent liver repair, was evident in both control IgG and FL6.13-treated mice, shown by IHC of CD45 (Figure S17D).39 CYP2E1 plays an essential role in APAP metabolism to generate N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a highly reactive metabolite that leads to hepatotoxicity.40 Since FL6.13 was shown to induce pericentral and periportal CYP2E1 expression in wild-type mice (Figure 6G), it is likely that 12 h post 600 mg/kg APAP injection, remnant APAP in mice was inadvertently metabolized to NAPQI by FL6.13-induced CYP2E1 expression, leading to a more severe liver injury. Our data suggest that early intervention with a Wnt agonist may have unintended consequences and may worsen APAP-induced liver injury due to induction of CYP2E1.",
        "Next, we investigated if late treatment of FL6.13 could have any therapeutic benefit through promoting regeneration, especially when APAP has already been metabolized. Such opportunity represents an unmet clinical need since there are no therapies currently available if NAC fails to prevent ALF when patients arrive for clinical intervention late after APAP overdose. Single dose of control IgG or FL6.13 was administrated at 32 h post 600 mg/kg APAP injection, and mice were sacrificed at 60 h (Figure 7A). Grossly, livers displayed normal color and appeared healthier in the FL6.13 group (Figure 7B). FL6.13-treated mice showed significantly reduced serum ALT, while AST trended favorably as well (Figure 7C). The control group showed pericentral necrotic areas at 60 h post APAP injection with increased expression of cyclin D1 in peri-necrotic hepatocytes (Figure 7D). Ki67-positive hepatocytes were seen surrounding necrotic regions and in hepatocytes in the periportal region (Figure 7D). FL6.13-treated mice exhibited a significantly reduced necrotic area, which was associated with a profound increase in cyclin D1-expressing hepatocytes pan-zonally, indicating that these cells are all able to enter the cell cycle across the liver lobule (Figures 7D and 7E). Many periportal hepatocytes, as well as pericentral hepatocytes, were Ki67 positive in the FL6.13-treated group, which was significantly more than the isotype control-treated group (Figures 7D and 7F). FL6.13 treatment showed a more localized immune cell response around necrotic regions, as seen by staining for CD45 (Figure 7D). Altogether, delayed Wnt agonism promotes liver repair after acute APAP injury by inducing hepatocyte proliferation that occurs locally and periportally and may be “pushing” hepatocytes toward the central vein to fill the space created by the cleared necrotic debris by the immune cells. Thus, these data extend the application of FL6.13 as delayed regenerative treatment choice in APAP-associated ALF and other relevant indications.Figure 7Late treatment with FL6.13 promotes liver repair after APAP injury through induction of hepatocyte proliferation(A) Study design showing administration of a single dose of 5 mg/kg pan-FZD agonist FL6.13 or isotype control IgG at 32 h post 600 mg/kg i.p.

        "Liver has a unique capacity to regenerate after PH.9,10 This allows surgical resection of part of liver for oncological indications and permits living donor and split-liver transplantation. LZ uniquely allows the hepatocytes located in various zones to perform specialized functions and also limits some injuries and disease processes to specific zones.7,8 Many studies show β-catenin as key regulator of LZ and LR.5 In view of this, it is important to answer, “Who regulates the regulator?” While Wnt2 and Wnt9b have been shown to be expressed in the central venous and pericentral sinusoidal ECs,19 and their upregulation observed in various liver injuries,17,20,21 their unequivocal roles in LZ and LR have not been established. Through genetic elimination of Wnt2 and Wnt9b from ECs, we provide conclusive evidence that these molecules play additive roles in instructing LZ and in driving hepatocyte proliferation after PH, despite a broader Wnt2 expression. We observed gender differences such that females were able to compensate singular Wnt2 or Wnt9b loss better than males, which requires further investigation. Also, Wnt2 and Wnt9b are conserved in their high expression in hepatic ECs in multiple species, suggesting that these two Wnts may be most physiological for use in hepatic regenerative medicine for regulating LZ and LR, just like Wnt7a, Wnt7b, and Wnt10a, have been shown to be relevant during cholestasis.41 Finally, based on analysis of human scRNA sequencing data from hepatic ECs, and location of β-catenin targets GLUL, AXIN2, and CYPs in zone 3 hepatocytes, it is likely that the same WNTs are also playing a role in human LZ.7,42,43",
        "Although previous studies have hinted at periportal genes being ectopically expressed in zone 3 hepatocytes upon β-catenin inhibition, the conclusions have been limited by lack of sensitive technical tools.4 Molecular Cartography enabled us to evaluate single-cell spatial expression of 100 genes on the same slide to analyze changes after genetic or pharmacological intervention. Such profiling of EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO livers revealed induction of many periportal genes de novo in pericentral hepatocytes. Intriguingly, for some genes, this change occurred simultaneously with increase, decrease, or no change in their normal baseline zonal expression. Loss of Wnt2 and Wnt9b or Wntless from hepatic ECs, or loss of β-catenin or LRP5-6 from hepatocytes, all led to similar absence of pericentral genes while simultaneously de-repressing and altering periportal gene expression. This suggests LZ to be a highly dynamic process constituted by simultaneous transcriptional activation and repression of genes in each zone. Periportalization of EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice led to resistance to APAP injury, as shown previously for other genetic mouse models of perturbed Wnt-β-catenin signaling.14,17,44 Interestingly, administration of Wnt agonist FL6.13 to a control animal induced zone 3 gene expression in periportal hepatocytes, but it did not result in loss of zone 1 genes. One possible explanation for the differences could be permanent genetic elimination versus transient effect brought about by administration of an exogenous molecule. Another possibility is the differential zonal dynamism of gene expression in hepatocytes residing in zone 3 versus zone 1. It is conceivable that, by default, all hepatocytes expressed periportal genes; however, hepatocytes in zone 3 acquire their zone 3 identity by exposure to neighborhood signals, such as from ECs, which led to repression of periportal genes while activating pericentral genes. Indeed, hepatocytes derived from differentiation of liver stem cells ex vivo, show spontaneous zone 1 expression, while zone 3 gene expression needed to be forced by β-catenin activation.45 While further studies are needed to address how zone 3 hepatocytes shift to periportal identity in the EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO mice, previous studies have also shown that HNF4α inhibits pericentral β-catenin targets.46 In the absence of β-catenin, TCF4 associated with HNF4α could possibly bind to HNF4α-responsive elements, inducing the expression of periportal genes, and could be one explanation for our observations.47,48 What regulates Wnt2 and Wnt9b expression and secretion at baseline in the ECs in zone 3, and what stimulates their immediate-early upregulation and release after PH, remains unknown.",
        "Being a critical pathway in modulating both hepatocyte metabolism and proliferation, activating the Wnt-β-catenin to promote hepatic function and restore mass is an attractive therapeutic strategy. We utilized FL6.13, a tetravalent antibody described recently, which induces FZD-LRP6 engagement to induce β-catenin activation.24 FL6.13 rescued pericentral LZ in EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO and EC-Wls-KO mice but not in LRP5-6-LDKO mice. FL6.13 expanded pericentral Wnt target genes in zone 1 and zone 2 but not at the expense of periportal genes. It simultaneously induced Ccnd1 expression, allowing hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle and in this way stimulated liver repair without impacting metabolic function. Such duality of Wnt agonism to induce cell proliferation while maintaining metabolic function could benefit treatment of acute and chronic liver insufficiency. While other agonists of Wnt signaling have been generated, our molecule directly engages Wnt receptor and co-receptor and hence is likely more potent and specific.6,49 A direct comparison with such agents is not currently feasible but may be necessary in the future. FL6.13 has been shown to activate Wnt signaling at other sites, including eye and intestines, based on the method of delivery.24,50 It did not show any adverse effects for the duration in our study as well as in the aforementioned studies.",
        "One specific and highly relevant unmet clinical need is delayed treatment of patients after APAP overdose. NAC is the only approved therapy for APAP overdose. If given within 4–10 h of APAP overdose, hepatoxicity could still develop in 6.1% cases. The chances of developing liver failure increases to 26.4% and 41% if NAC is administered 10–24 h or beyond 24 h of APAP overdose, respectively.51 There is no effective therapy beyond 24 h and patients will either spontaneously recover or require transplant. Our data provide a new treatment option of administering regenerative therapy to cases who are either delayed seeking medical attention or progress to failure despite NAC administration. The advantage of use of FL6.13 is that it enhances pericentral LZ while simultaneously promoting zone 3 and 1 hepatocyte proliferation. The periportal hepatocyte proliferation may be creating a push for hepatocytes to move pericentrally to restore microarchitecture in this area as necrosis is cleared by the immune cells. However, premature Wnt stimulation could inadvertently induce more injury through induction of β-catenin targets, such as CYP2E1 and CYP1A2, which generate toxic APAP metabolites, and hence timing of intervention with FL6.13 will be critical, and likely be monitored by serum APAP levels. However, regenerative therapy fills an important niche in the treatment of ALF due to APAP and perhaps other causes.",
        "Our study shows role of Wnt-β-catenin agonism in promoting zone 3 gene expression and in inducing LR in two clinically relevant models. There are, however, limitations of our study. First, animal models of liver injury, such as >85% or extended hepatectomy or lethal doses of APAP, lead to quick demise of mice leaving an abbreviated and sometimes variable therapeutic intervention opportunity for any agent to act and reproducibly demonstrate survival efficacy. This limited our ability to show the survival advantage of Wnt agonism. Secondly, other inducers of the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway have been reported. We were unable to directly compare the efficacy of FL6.13 with such agonists, which could have provided important information regarding superiority or advantage of one subclass over another. Future studies should directly address these two important shortcomings of our study.",

        "All animal husbandry and experimental procedures, including animal housing and diet, were performed under the guidelines and approval of the National Institutes of Health and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. Mice were fed regular chow in standard caging and kept under a 12-h light–dark cycle with no enrichment. Lyve1-cre mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Wnt9bflox/flox mice were reported before.30\nWnt2 exon-2-floxed mice were generated by insertion of LoxP sites flanking exon 2, through use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology as described elsewhere.52 Briefly, using single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), double-strand breaks flanking exon 2 were targeted to optimal CAS9 target sites within introns 1 and 2. A synthetic floxed allele was generated as a single-stranded-oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) template for homology-directed repair (HDR). The HDR template was a megamer, 1166bp ssDNA oligo (Integrated DNA Technologies), encoding exon 2 flanked by LoxP sites with adjacent EcoR1 sites for genotyping and 5′ AND-3′ homology arms homologous to the genomic sequences up-and downstream of the 5′ AND-3′ CAS9 cut sites in Introns 1 and 2. Homologous recombination was achieved by microinjection of a mixture of Cas9 protein (0.3 μM), I1 & I2 sgRNAs (21.23 ng/μL each) and the ssODN (10 ng/μL) into the pronuclei of fertilized embryos (C57BL/6J, The Jackson Laboratory). The injected zygotes were cultured overnight, the next day the embryos that developed to the 2-cell stage were transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant CD1 female recipients. Offspring were genotyped by PCR and RFLP analysis to confirm insertion of 5′and 3′ loxP sites. Founder mice, M14 and M15, were backcrossed with C57BL/6J wildtype (WT) mice for two generations and selected for the presence of Wnt2flox/flox allele to generate N2 mice, which were then bred with Wnt9bflox/flox, Rosa-stopflox/flox-EYFP, and Lyve1-cre+/− mice.

        "Single-cell spatial transcriptomic analysis was performed according to the workflow in the Figures S10 and S13. Two bioinformatic pipelines were applied to study the data. For the first pipeline, gene counts were quantified per cell based on the cell identification from QuPath software.54 Slide control, slide EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO, and slide FL6.13 treatment were integrated by R package Seurat.55 For quality control, cells with less than 10 gene-count were filtered out. Non-hepatocyte cells were defined by the cells with any expression of the five non-hepatocyte makers (Lrat, Pecam1, Ptprc, Lyz2, and Adgre1) and were removed from further analysis when comparing control and FL6.13 treatment (Figure S13). After pre-processing, dimension reduction method principal component analysis (PCA) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)56 were performed on hepatocytes based on 16 zonated markers (pericentral markers: Cldn2, Lect2, Glul, Oat, Cyp1a2, Cyp2e1, Gstm1, Rgn; midzonal markers: Pon1; periportal markers: Gls2, G6pc, Fbp1, Hsd17b13, Vtn, Cyp2f2, Pigr). Eventually, cells were grouped into distinct clusters and annotated by the zonated genes. Feature plots and violin plots were generated by Seurat to visualize gene expression at cell-level and cluster-level.",
        "For the second pipeline, a line was drawn from center of central vein (marking pericentral region) to portal vein (marking periportal region) based on respective landmark genes (Cyp2e1, Glul, and Sox9). Then an upper-bound and a lower-bound line were drawn parallel to the central line with 500-pixel extension. Bounded by these two lines, perpendicular lines were drawn to separate the region between pericentral and periportal into 9 equal segments. In total, 7, 9, and 9 pericentral-to-periportal regions were identified in slide control, slide EC-Wnt2-9b-DKO, and slide FL6.13 treatment, respectively. Gene counts and expression density (gene counts per area) were quantified within each segment and averaged across the defined pericentral-to-periportal regions. Cells located in these 9-segments were also identified based on their X, Y positions in the slides and traced back to the UMAPs to show the histological location of cells.",
        "Mouse liver samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen as recommended by the Molecular Cartography protocol. Frozen samples were sectioned with a cryostat (Leica, CM 1850-3-1) and 10µm thick sections were placed within the capture areas of cold Resolve Biosciences slides. Samples were then sent to Resolve BioSciences on dry ice for analysis. Upon arrival, tissue sections were thawed and fixed according to Molecular Cartography protocol with MF1 for 30 min at 4°C. After fixation, sections were washed twice in 1x PBS for two min, followed by one min washes in 70% Ethanol at room temperature. Fixed samples were undergoing an alcoholic series starting with an incubation in isopropanol for 1 min, followed by 95% and 75% ethanol. The samples were used for Molecular Cartography™ (100-plex combinatorial single molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization) according to the manufacturer’s instructions Day 1: Molecular Preparation Protocol for mouse or human liver, starting with the aspiration of ethanol and the addition of buffer DST3 followed by tissue priming and hybridization. Briefly, tissues were primed for 30 minutes at 37°C followed by overnight hybridization of all probes specific for the target genes (see below for probe design details and target list). Samples were washed the next day to remove excess probes and fluorescently tagged in a two-step color development process. Regions of interest were imaged as described below and fluorescent signals removed during decolorization. Color development, imaging and decolorization were repeated for multiple cycles to build a unique combinatorial code for every target gene that was derived from raw images as described below.",
        "The probes for 100 genes were designed using Resolve’s proprietary design algorithm. Briefly, the probe-design was performed at the gene-level. For every targeted gene all full-length protein coding transcript sequences from the ENSEMBL database were used as design targets if the isoform had the GENCODE annotation tag ‘basic’.57,58 To speed up the process, the calculation of computationally expensive parts, especially the off-target searches, the selection of probe sequences was not performed randomly, but limited to sequences with high success rates. To filter highly repetitive regions, the abundance of k-mers was obtained from the background transcriptome using Jellyfish.59 Every target sequence was scanned once for all k-mers, and those regions with rare k-mers were preferred as seeds for full probe design. A probe candidate was generated by extending a seed sequence until a certain target stability was reached. A set of simple rules was applied to discard sequences that were found experimentally to cause problems. After these fast screens, every kept probe candidate was mapped to the background transcriptome using ThermonucleotideBLAST60 and probes with stable off-target hits were discarded. Specific probes were then scored based on the number of on-target matches (isoforms), which were weighted by their associated APPRIS level,61 favoring principal isoforms over others. A bonus was added if the binding-site was inside the protein-coding region. From the pool of accepted probes, the final set was composed by greedily picking the highest scoring probes. The gene names and specific probes designed by Resolve BioSciences are included in Table S3.",
        "Regions of interests were identified by us. Based on these, samples were imaged on a Zeiss Celldiscoverer 7, using the 50x Plan Apochromat water immersion objective with an NA of 1.2 and the 0.5x magnification changer, resulting in a 25x final magnification. Standard CD7 LED excitation light source, filters, and dichroic mirrors were used together with customized emission filters optimized for detecting specific signals. Excitation time per image was 1000 ms for each channel (DAPI was 20 ms). A z-stack was taken at each region with a distance per z-slice according to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The custom CD7 CMOS camera (Zeiss Axiocam Mono 712, 3.45 µm pixel size) was used. For each region, a z-stack per fluorescent color (two colors) was imaged per imaging round. A total of 8 imaging rounds were done for each position, resulting in 16 z-stacks per region. The completely automated imaging process per round (including water immersion generation and precise relocation of regions to image in all three dimensions) was realized by a custom python script using the scripting API of the Zeiss ZEN software (Open application development).",

        "As a first step all images were corrected for background fluorescence. A target value for the allowed number of maxima was determined based upon the area of the slice in µm² multiplied by the factor 0.5. This factor was empirically optimized. The brightest maxima per plane were determined, based upon an empirically optimized threshold. The number and location of the respective maxima was stored. This procedure was done for every image slice independently. Maxima that did not have a neighboring maximum in an adjacent slice (called z-group) were excluded. The resulting maxima list was further filtered in an iterative loop by adjusting the allowed thresholds for (Babs-Bback) and (Bperi-Bback) to reach a feature target value (Babs: absolute brightness, Bback: local background, Bperi: background of periphery within 1 pixel). This feature target values were based upon the volume of the 3D-image. Only maxima still in a zgroup of at least 2 after filtering were passing the filter step. Each z-group was counted as one hit. The members of the z-groups with the highest absolute brightness were used as features and written to a file. They resemble a 3D-point cloud. Final signal segmentation and decoding: To align the raw data images from different imaging rounds, images had to be corrected. To do so the extracted feature point clouds were used to find the transformation matrices. For this purpose, an iterative closest point cloud algorithm was used to minimize the error between two point-clouds. The point clouds of each round were aligned to the point cloud of round one (reference point cloud). The corresponding point clouds were stored for downstream processes. Based upon the transformation matrices the corresponding images were processed by a rigid transformation using trilinear interpolation. The aligned images were used to create a profile for each pixel consisting of 16 values (16 images from two color channels in 8 imaging rounds). The pixel profiles were filtered for variance from zero normalized by total brightness of all pixels in the profile. Matched pixel profiles with the highest score were assigned as an ID to the pixel. Pixels with neighbors having the same ID were grouped. The pixel groups were filtered by group size, number of direct adjacent pixels in group, number of dimensions with size of two pixels. The local 3D-maxima of the groups were determined as potential final transcript locations. Maxima were filtered by number of maxima in the raw data images where a maximum was expected. Remaining maxima were further evaluated by the fit to the corresponding code. The remaining maxima were written to the results file and considered to resemble transcripts of the corresponding gene. The ratio of signals matching to codes used in the experiment and signals matching to codes not used in the experiment were used as estimation for specificity (false positives).",

    "title": "Balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocytes regulates hepatic vascular reconstitution in postoperative liver regeneration. in patients undergoing hepatectomy, with hepatic vascular reconstitution playing a critical role. However, the regulators of hepatic vascular reconstitution remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of hepatic vascular reconstitution and identify biomarkers predicting PHLF in patients undergoing hepatectomy. METHODS: Candidate genes that were associated with hepatic vascular reconstitution were screened using adeno-associated virus vectors in Alb-Cre-CRISPR/Cas9 mice subjected to partial hepatectomy. The biological activities of candidate genes were estimated using endothelial precursor transfusion and associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) models. The level of candidates was detected in biopsies from patients undergoing ALPPS. Risk factors for PHLF were also screened using retrospective data. RESULTS: Downregulation of Gata3 and upregulation of Ramp2 in hepatocytes promoted the proliferation of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatic revascularization. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) played opposite roles in regulating the migration of endothelial precursors from bone marrow and the formation of new sinusoids after hepatectomy. Gata3 restricted endothelial cell function in patient-derived hepatic organoids, which was abrogated by a Gata3 inhibitor. Moreover, overexpression of Gata3 led to higher mortality in ALPPS mice, which was improved by a PEDF-neutralizing antibody. The expression of Gata3/RAMP and PEDF/VEGFA tended to have a negative correlation in patients undergoing ALPPS. A nomogram incorporating multiple factors, such as serum PEDF/VEGF index, was constructed and could efficiently predict the risk of PHLF. CONCLUSIONS: The balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocytes regulates the proliferation of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatic revascularization via changes in the expression of PEDF and VEGFA, revealing potential targets for the prevention and treatment of PHLF. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: In this study, we show that the balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocytes regulates hepatic vascular reconstitution by promoting a shift from pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) to vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression during hepatectomy- or ALLPS (associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy)-induced liver regeneration. We also identified serum PEDF/VEGFA index as a potential predictor of post-hepatectomy liver failure in patients who underwent hepatectomy. This study improves our understanding of how hepatocytes contribute to liver regeneration and provides new targets for the prevention and treatment of post-hepatectomy liver failure.

      "title": "A CD8+ T Cell Infiltration–Driven Prognostic Signature for Gastric Cancer: Bridging Tumor Immunity and Clinical Outcomes",
      "abstract": "Background: CD8 + T cells play pivotal roles in antitumor immunity, where infiltration levels often correlate with favorable prognosis. However, the functional heterogeneity of CD8 + T cell subsets within the gastric cancer (GC) tumor microenvironment (TME)—particularly their divergent impacts on tumor progression, immunotherapy response, and clinical outcomes—remains poorly characterized. Methods: We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 23 GC tissues (GEO: GSE150290) with bulk transcriptomic profiles from TCGA-STAD to dissect CD8 + T cell heterogeneity. Analytical pipelines included unsupervised clustering, pseudotime trajectory analysis, and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network construction to identify survival-associated hub genes. Differential gene expression, functional enrichment, and experimental validation were performed to confirm clinical relevance. Results: scRNA-seq resolved CD8 + T cells into five functionally distinct subsets: naïve/memory, exhausted, and three cytotoxic subpopulations. Among these, cytotoxic CD8 + T1 cells exhibited the strongest prognostic relevance, with high infiltration correlating to improved survival and enrichment in G2-grade tumors. Pseudotime analysis revealed differentiation trajectories from naïve to exhausted subsets, accompanied by metabolic and immune checkpoint pathway alterations. PPI network analysis identified SELL, CD79B, and RAMP2 as hub genes, all significantly linked to survival and differentially expressed across tumor grades/stages. Experimental validation confirmed that SELL, CD79B, and RAMP2 knockdown suppressed GC cell proliferation, underscoring their functional roles. Conclusion: Our study unveils the landscape of CD8 + T cell heterogeneity in GC and proposes a three-gene signature (SELL/CD79B/RAMP2) with dual prognostic and therapeutic potential. These findings provide actionable insights for stratifying patients, tailoring immunotherapy regimens, and developing novel targets to enhance antitumor immunity in GC.",

        "Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignancy and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally [1], with over 70% of patients diagnosed at advanced stages where therapeutic options yield limited survival benefits [2, 3]. While immunotherapy has revolutionized oncology—notably in melanoma and hematologic malignancies—its efficacy in solid tumors like GC remains suboptimal [4]. This disparity stems from the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and dysfunctional immune cell states, which collectively impair cytotoxic T cell activity [5–9].",
        "CD8+ T cells, pivotal mediators of antitumor immunity, exhibit functional heterogeneity within the TME. However, their subset-specific roles in GC progression, therapy resistance, and immune checkpoint regulation remain poorly defined. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have enabled high-resolution dissection of TME complexity, revealing cell type–specific signatures linked to tumor evolution and immunotherapy response [10–14]. For instance, scRNA-seq studies in liver and lung cancers have uncovered T cell exhaustion trajectories and activation-impaired subsets predictive of clinical outcomes [15–18]. Yet, a systematic characterization of CD8+ T cell heterogeneity in GC—critical for developing targeted immunotherapies—is lacking.",
        "Here, we integrate scRNA-seq of 23 GC tissues with bulk transcriptomic data to resolve CD8+ T cell heterogeneity. We delineate subset-specific functional states, differentiation trajectories, and immune checkpoint dynamics. Crucially, through in vitro functional validation, we demonstrate that three hub genes (SELL, CD79B, RAMP2)—identified via protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks—directly regulate GC cell proliferation. These findings not only map the landscape of immune dysfunction in GC but also provide actionable biomarkers for personalized immunotherapy regimens.",
        "GC scRNA-seq was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE150290). And 123,302 cells from 23 GC tissue samples were screened. From the TCGA Xena database (https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/), the transcriptome and sample phenotypic data of TCGA-STAD were downloaded; a total of 408 samples were obtained, of which 377 were tumor tissues (27 of the samples had no survival information and were excluded from subsequent analysis) and 31 were normal tissues. The fpkm expressed values were used for subsequent analysis. A total of 69 KEGG metabolic gene sets were obtained from c2.cp.kegg.v2023.1.Hs.symbols.gmt from MSigDB. The 50 hallmark gene sets (h.all.v2023.1.Hs.symbols.gmt) were obtained from MSigDB, representing well-defined biological processes and states relevant to cancer immunology.",
        "We used the Seurat R package to map the expression profile of CD8A and CD8B (the classic CD8+ T cell markers) and determined the CD8+ T cell population. Then, UMAP cluster analysis was performed, and each cell subset was annotated according to the expression distribution of CD8+ T cell subtypes. Then, we counted the proportion of each subset of CD8+ T cells and used the ggplot2 R package to draw a bar chart. Hypervariable genes of each subtype were examined by using the Seurat R package. The top 10 highly variable genes of each subtype were selected, and the heatmap R package was used to draw the heatmap of gene expression. We annotated marker genes from previously reported studies [19].",
        "Seurat R package was used to obtain the hypervariable genes of each subset of CD8+ T cells, which were screened by the Bonferroni correction p value < 0.05. For screening of gene expression, we used CIBERSORTx (https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/) tools and got CD8+ T cell subtype of GC signature matrix file. The transcriptome data of TCGA-STAD were collated, and the expressed count value was converted into CPM as the input file of CIBERSORTx to estimate the content of CD8+ T cell subtypes in GC (Supporting Information 1). Then, we used the surv_cutpoint function from the survminer R package to determine optimal cutoffs for cellular composition analysis. Using maximally selected rank statistics, TCGA-STAD samples were divided into high- and low-level groups. And we used the Survival package and survminer package to plot the survival curve of KM (Supporting Information 2). The phenotypic data of TCGA-STAD were sorted. Boxplots were drawn to show the difference in cellular composition between gender, grade, stage, age, diagnosis, disease types, and tissues.",
        "To infer each subset of CD8+ T cell infiltration levels in TCGA-STAD, we used the expression matrix of the three subtype CD8+ T cells as a signature matrix, TCGA-STAD log2 transformed CPM matrix as a mixture, and CIBERSORTx tool to estimate the infiltration level for each primary tumor sample.",
        "To identify gene sets or pathways relatively enriched in the cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell Cluster 1 (cytotoxic_CD8_T_cell_1), we performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. First, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the FindMarkers function in the Seurat package, with a threshold of log2 fold change > 0.5 and an adjusted p value < 0.05. All other parameters were retained at their default settings.",
        "To explore which pathway is enriched in cytotoxic_CD8_T_cell_1, we first sort genes by log2 fold change and then use hallmark genes and the GSEA function from clusterProfiler to perform GSEA enrichment analysis. The enrichment result was visualized with a heatmap.",
        "To explore whether the enrichment level of each CD8+ T cell correlated with survival, we first grouped tumor samples from TCGA-STAD into high and low groups for each subtype with the surv_cutpoint and surv_categorize functions from the survminer package based on the infiltration levels returned by CIBERSORTx. Then, we performed survival analysis between high and low groups with the survival package.",
        "To define these groups, the surv_cutpoint function from the survminer R package was used to find the optimal cutpoint for cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell 1, cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell 3, and naïve memory CD8+ T cell infiltration score. This function uses maximally selected rank statistics, which assume that an unknown cutoff in the independent variable X (the infiltration score) determines two groups of observations regarding the response Y (the survival time and state), and these two groups have the largest statistic between each other.",
        "For scRNA-seq data, we used the FindMarkers function in the Seurat R package to obtain the high variable genes of five subtype CD8+ T cells with p value < 0.05. We used the STRING database (https://www.string-db.org/) to construct the PPI network and then used Cytoscape (v3.10.1) with the cytoHubba plug-in (MCC algorithm, top 10 nodes) to screen hub genes. Hub genes with survival differences were selected, and violin plots were drawn to show their expression differences between gender, grade, stage, age, diagnosis, disease types, and tissues.",
        "To explore differential trajectory among five CD8+ T cell subtypes, we conducted pseudotime analysis of CD8+ T cells with the slingshot R package with default parameters after dimensionality reduction.",
        "To identify key regulator genes of cytotoxic_CD8_T_cell_1 differentiation, we performed expression analysis between high and low groups of cytotoxic_CD8_T_cell_1 infiltration. Using p value < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1, we totally identified 96 DEGs. With these genes, we built the PPI interaction network and then ranked these genes with MCC algorithms and the top 10 important genes were extracted as candidate genes. Survival analysis showed that SELL, CD79B, and RAMP2 significantly correlated with TCGA-STAD patient survival status.",
        "Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells from each group were collected and their mRNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA following the instructions provided by the reverse transcription kit (Takara). For qRT-PCR, the real-time fluorescent PCR instrument LightCycle96 was utilized. GAPDH served as the internal reference gene. The relative expression levels were calculated using the 2^-ΔΔCt method. The primer sequences are listed in Supporting Information 3: Table S1.",
        "Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a concentration of 2∗104 cells per well and subsequently cultured in an incubator maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2. At specific time points posttransfection—12, 24, 36, and 48 h—10 μL of CCK-8 solution was added to each well. Following this addition, the cells were returned to the incubator for an additional 2 h of incubation. Using a microplate reader (Thermo), the optical density value at 450 nm was then measured for each well.",
        "To assess cell proliferation, an EdU (5-ethynyl-2⁣′-deoxyuridine) proliferation assay was conducted. Briefly, cells transfected with siRNA or siNC were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well. The cells were treated with 10 nM docetaxel for 48 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 10 μmol/L EdU (Beyotime, China) for 2 h. After fixation, the cells underwent EdU staining and DNA staining, adhering strictly to the manufacturer's instructions, to detect the number of cycling cells during the EdU treatment period. The cells were then imaged using fluorescence microscopy, and the number of proliferating cells was averaged to determine the labeling index.",
        "The cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 2000 cells per well and then grown for 14 days with the indicated treatments. After being fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, Cat#: P0099-100 mL) at room temperature, the colonies were stained with 1% crystal violet (Solarbio, Cat#: G1063) for 15 min.",
        "We performed statistical analyses of genes differently expressed in different subsets, KEGG, GO, and GSEA analyses, by using the corresponding packages or default methods in the software. Random arrangement tests exhibited statistical pathway activity. In tumor and normal tissue samples, we used Student's test to assess the frequency of different cell types and used statistical analysis to examine the levels of expression. The log-rank test was used to test the significance of the KM curves. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to determine dynamic changes in cell proportion and levels of gene expression at various stages of pathology. We used the Kruskal–Wallis test to determine dynamic changes in cell proportions and gene expression levels at different clinical features.",
        "We downloaded the scRNA-seq dataset GSE150290 from the GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and screened 23 GC tissue samples from it, totaling 123,302 cells. Supporting Information 4: Figure S1A shows the gene number, gene count, mitochondrial percentage, and hemoglobin (HB) percentage. The Pearson correlation coefficient between sequencing depth and the number of genes detected is 0.86 (p < 2.2e − 16) (Supporting Information 4: Figure S1B), whereas the correlation coefficients between sequencing depth and both mitochondrial abundance (Supporting Information 4: Figure S1C) and HB concentration are −0.01 each (Supporting Information 4: Figure S1D). These data indicate a positive correlation between sequencing depth and the number of genes measured. In this study, for single-cell data, we have established the following screening criteria: the gene count primarily ranges from 300 to 7000, the gene expression level does not exceed 100,000, the proportion of mitochondrial content is less than 10%, and the proportion of HB content is less than 1%. Based on these, we selected 2000 highly expressed and DEGs for principal component analysis (PCA), and the results indicated that all 16 principal components were highly significant (Supporting Information 4: Figure S1E).",
        "To conduct an in-depth analysis of CD8+ T cells, we employed the UMAP clustering method and successfully identified 15 distinct cell clusters (Figure 1a). Of particular note is that Cluster 4 has become the primary residence for CD8A (Figure 1b) and CD8B (Figure 1c) cells, encompassing a total of 5380 cells. We selected Cluster 4 for further analysis and reapplied the UMAP clustering technique, ultimately successfully identifying five subsets of CD8+ T cells (Figure 1d).",
        "These CD8+ T cell subsets exhibit their unique markers: naive/memory CD8+ T cells are characterized by the markers including TCF7, GPR183, CCR7, S100A10, IL7R, LEF1, SELL, SATB1, and LTB; cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are identified by the markers such as NKG7, PRF1, GZMK, and GZMA, while exhausted CD8+ T cells display a series of markers including GIMAP6, CXCL13, CXCR6, SPB1, IRF4, LAYN, HSPH1, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1 (also known as PD-1), TIGIT, and HAVCR2 (also known as TIM-3). Based on these distinctive markers, we have classified these five cell subsets as follows: naive/memory CD8+ T cells, exhausted CD8+ T cells, and three distinct cytotoxic CD8+ T cell subsets (labeled as cytotoxic CD8+ T Cells 1, 2, and 3) (Figure 1d).",
        "In the single-cell dataset of GC, the proportion of cells within each subgroup showed that naive/memory CD8+ T cells accounted for the highest proportion, followed by cytotoxic CD8+ T Cells 1, while exhausted CD8+ T cells accounted for the lowest proportion (Figure 1e). Additionally, we conducted an analysis of the top 30 DEGs across the five CD8+ T cell subsets (Figure 1f). Utilizing the transcriptome data from TCGA-STAD, we calculated the proportions of various T cell subsets using GDC (Figure 1g) and CIBERSORTx (Figure 1h). The results indicated that the proportions of exhausted CD8+ T cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell 1 were the highest.",
        "The results of survival analysis using the log-rank test showed significant differences in survival between groups with different characteristics, including high and low proportions of cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell Subset 1 (Figure 2a,b), as well as the proportion of naive/memory CD8+ T cells (Figure 2c). However, the survival difference observed among exhausted CD8+ T Cell 3 did not reach statistical significance (Supporting Information 5: Figure S2A). In addition, due to the extremely limited number of cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell 2, we cannot calculate the survival difference for them. The above results showed that cytotoxic CD8+ T1 cells had a high proportion and high tumor cell lysis ability, so this subpopulation was selected for further investigation.",
        "To gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics of this subpopulation, we conducted a detailed analysis of its distribution under various conditions. In terms of gender distribution, the proportion of cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell 1 did not show significant differences (Supporting Information 5: Figure S2B). However, when we examined its distribution across different grade groups, we found significant differences (Figure 2d), with the highest ratio observed in G2-grade GC. Additionally, despite the different stages of GC, the proportion of cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell 1 remained relatively constant (Supporting Information 5: Figure S2C). Notably, the lowest proportion of cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell 1 was found in the 81–100 age group (Figure 2e). Meanwhile, we also observed that there were no significant differences in the proportion of cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell 1 among different diagnoses (Figure 2f), disease types (Supporting Information 5: Figure S2D), and tissues (Supporting Information 5: Figure S2E). Intriguingly, statistically significant differences emerged in the proportion of cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell 1 within diagnosis subgroups (Figure 2f).",
        "To explore the presence of heterogeneous pathways within CD8+ T cell subsets, we performed GO and KEGG analyses. The GO analysis revealed that cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell 1 exhibited distinct biological processes (Figure 3a), cellular components (Figure 3b), and molecular functions (Figure 3c). The KEGG results further indicated that these cytotoxic CD8+ T Cells 1 were associated with ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Figure 3d). To gain a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity among various subgroups, we also examined the metabolic pathway activity and hallmark immune checkpoint pathway activity within cell subgroups. Our analysis of metabolic pathway activity in cell subsets uncovered that exhaustive CD8+ T cells underwent the most significant alterations (Figure 3e). Moreover, the hallmark pathway activity analysis showed that both exhausted CD8+ T cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T Cells 3 exhibited the most altered pathway activity (Figure 3f).",
        "Subsequently, we conducted a cell differentiation trajectory analysis. This analysis identified two lineages, both originating from naive/memory CD8+ T cells and progressing to exhausted CD8+ T cells, with distinct intermediate cytotoxic CD8+ T cell subgroups (Figure 3g). The results of the cell differentiation trajectory analysis were consistent with the actual biological process.",
        "Building on the insights gained from the pathway activity and cell differentiation analyses, we next focus on the identification of prognostic and therapeutic markers. Utilizing the TCGA database, we initially screened out 422 DEGs based on significant survival differences, with 76 upregulated genes and 346 downregulated genes as the volcanic map showed (Figure 3h). After considering the fold change and p value, we screened out 95 DEGs. Based on these DEG data, we successfully constructed a PPI network (Figure 3i) and further identified key hub genes using the cytoHubba tool. Finally, we identified the top 10 key genes, which are SPI1, CORO1A, NCF1, SELL, WAS, LGALS9, TNFRSF4, CD79B, LTB, and RAMP2 (Figure 3j). Further analysis of the log-rank test revealed that, among these 10 core genes, the survival difference for SELL was statistically significant (Figure 3k), with CD79B (Figure 3l) and RAMP2 (Figure 3m) also demonstrating significant survival differences.",
        "We investigated the expression levels of these genes across various clinical characteristics, which encompass gender, age, GC staging and grading, diagnostic types, specific types of GC, and tissues. The results indicate that the expression of SELL, CD79B, and RAMP2 genes exhibits significant differences in certain clinical characteristics. Specifically, the expression levels of SELL and CD79B show notable variations in GC grading (Figure 4a,b), staging (Figure 4c,d), and diagnostic types (Figure 4e,f). Although the RAMP2 gene does not demonstrate significant differences in GC staging (Supporting Information 6: Figure S3A), it does exhibit distinct expression differences in grading (particularly between G2 and G3) (Figure 4g) and diagnostic types (Figure 4h). However, it is noteworthy that no significant differences in the expression of SELL, CD79B, and RAMP2 were found across different dimensions such as gender (Supporting Information 6: Figure S3B–D), age (Supporting Information 6: Figure S3E–G), tissue location (Supporting Information 6: Figure S3H–J), and pathological types (Supporting Information 6: Figure S3K–M) (p > 0.05).",
        "Ultimately, we conducted a thorough analysis of the expression patterns of these genes across various cancer types and uncovered that, in GC, the expression levels of SELL (Figure 4i) and RAMP2 (Figure 4j) are significantly elevated compared to normal tissue. Notably, although the expression level of CD79B did not exhibit significant fluctuations in comparative analyses (Supporting Information 6: Figure S3N), its importance in GC cannot be overlooked. This series of discoveries strongly suggests that SELL, CD79B, and RAMP2 have the potential to emerge as novel and highly promising prognostic indicators and therapeutic targets in the field of GC, opening up new perspectives and possibilities for precision medicine in this disease.",
        "To validate the expression of these three disease-related hub genes, we compared their expression in normal gastric epithelial cells and GC cells. The results showed the expression differences of SELL, RAMP2, and CD79B exhibited an upward trend in expression in GC cells with statistical significance (Figures 5a, 5b, and 5c). Furthermore, we used siRNA to knock down the expressions of SELL, RAMP2, and CD79B in GC cells. Cell viability (Figures 5d, 5e, and 5f) and proliferation (Figures 5g, 5h, 5i, 5j, and 5l) experiments demonstrated that the expression of these three genes was significantly correlated with the proliferation of GC cells. Besides, after treatment with siRNA, the number of clone-forming colonies was significantly reduced, confirming that knocking down the expression of SELL, RAMP2, and CD79B inhibited the proliferation of GC cells (Figure 5m).",
        "To investigate the functional roles of SELL, RAMP2, and CD79B in GC progression, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of these genes in GC cell lines and assessed their impacts on tumor-associated pathways via qPCR. We found that knockdown of SELL, RAMP2, or CD79B significantly downregulated MMP2 (a key mediator of extracellular matrix degradation), VEGFA (a proangiogenic factor), and HIF1A (a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor) compared to scramble siRNA controls (Figures 6a, 6b, and 6c). As indicated in Figure 3, alterations in metabolic pathways may contribute to cellular heterogeneity, and given the central role of glycolysis—a highly scrutinized metabolic process—we specifically examined three critical glycolytic genes (HK2, PFKP, and GLUT1). Following siRNA-mediated knockdown of SELL, RAMP2, and CD79B in GC cells, qPCR analysis revealed significant downregulation of the aforementioned glycolysis pathway components HK2 (Figure 6d), PFKP (Figure 6e), and GLUT1 (Figure 6f). These findings demonstrate that SELL, RAMP2, and CD79B collaboratively drive GC progression by regulating invasion, angiogenesis, hypoxia adaptation, and metabolic reprogramming. Their targeted intervention may provide novel strategies to suppress multidimensional malignant phenotypes in GC.",
        "Immunotherapy has emerged as a cornerstone of cancer treatment, yet its application in GC remains hindered by an incomplete understanding of TME dynamics [20–22]. A comprehensive understanding of the internal immune microenvironment of cancer tissue is crucial for developing novel immunotherapies. Notably, CD8+ T cells, the cornerstone effector T cells in current tumor immunotherapy [23], recognize tumor-associated antigens presented on cancer cell surfaces as major histocompatibility complex class I molecules [24].",
        "Single-cell sequencing technology is an effective tool for studying the immune microenvironment of GC, playing a vital role in immune cell therapy and antibody drug development [25, 26]. This research provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism and potential targets for the application of immunotherapy in the field of GC. Through scRNA-seq, we classified CD8+ T cells into five subsets, including three cytotoxic subpopulations with divergent prognostic impacts. Cytotoxic CD8+ T1 cells—enriched in G2-grade tumors and associated with improved survival—represent a therapeutically actionable subset, underscoring the importance of subset-specific functional states in clinical outcomes. Our in vitro experiments revealed that SELL, CD79B, and RAMP2 are functionally critical for GC cell proliferation. SELL (a regulator of lymphocyte homing) [27–29], RAMP2 (implicated in vascular remodeling) [30, 31], and CD79B (a B cell receptor component) [32, 33] exhibited tumor-specific upregulation and functional roles in GC proliferation, as validated by siRNA knockdown. These genes correlate with tumor grade and stage, suggesting utility as biomarkers for patient stratification. Potential mechanisms of these genes may include L-selectin-mediated lymphocyte infiltration (SELL), AMPK-dependent glycolysis (RAMP2), and BCR signaling feedback (CD79B). Our pseudotime analysis revealed differentiation trajectories from naïve to exhausted CD8+ T cells, accompanied by metabolic reprogramming and immune checkpoint upregulation (e.g., PDCD1 and CTLA4). These findings align with prior studies in NSCLC and liver cancer [15, 16] yet uniquely implicate ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in cytotoxic subset dysfunction—a potential target for reinvigorating antitumor immunity.",
        "Our findings pave the way for personalized immunotherapy in GC through three actionable strategies: (1) biomarker-driven stratification—the SELL/RAMP2 expression signature could identify patients likely to benefit from PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibitors or antiangiogenic agents, while elevated CD79B levels may predict responsiveness to B cell-targeted therapies (e.g., rituximab analogs); (2) targeted combination strategies—combined inhibition of RAMP2 and VEGF pathways could disrupt tumor vasculature while enhancing T cell infiltration, and small-molecule SELL inhibitors might synergize with checkpoint blockade to suppress metastasis; (3) dynamic monitoring—longitudinal profiling of these genes during therapy could enable adaptive treatment adjustments to circumvent resistance. Different from conventional approaches relying on bulk transcriptome profiles or generic immune scoring systems, our three-gene signature derived from single-cell sequencing synthesizes three important dimensions: cellular subset specificity, prognostic significance, and therapeutic tractability. This new framework provides a more adaptable instrument for clinical management, particularly in directing immunotherapy and combination therapy for gastric carcinoma. Together, these approaches exemplify a precision oncology framework to optimize immunotherapy outcomes in GC.",
        "In conclusion, this study establishes CD8+ T cell heterogeneity as a central determinant of GC progression and therapy resistance. By integrating single-cell analytics with functional genomics, we propose a precision medicine framework to tailor immunotherapies based on SELL/CD79B/RAMP2 profiles—a strategy poised to transform GC management.",
        "Although our in vitro experiments have confirmed the roles of SELL, CD79B, and RAMP2, animal-based experiments are also essential for the improvement of clinical transformation. We plan to use GC mouse models to assess the therapeutic relevance of these genes in future studies, particularly in relation to immunotherapy. This will help strengthen the clinical translational value of our findings.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of beta cell regeneration induced by GCGR antagonism in mice. METHODS: The db/db mice and high-fat diet (HFD)+streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mice with type 2 diabetes were treated with antagonistic GCGR monoclonal antibody (mAb), and the metabolic variables and islet cell quantification were evaluated. Plasma cytokine array and liver RNA sequencing data were used to screen possible mediators, including fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). ELISA, quantitative RT-PCR and western blot were applied to verify FGF21 change. Blockage of FGF21 signalling by FGF21-neutralising antibody (nAb) was used to clarify whether FGF21 was involved in the effects of GCGR mAb on the expression of beta cell identity-related genes under plasma-conditional culture and hepatocyte co-culture conditions. FGF21 nAb-treated db/db mice, systemic Fgf21-knockout (Fgf21(-/-)) diabetic mice and hepatocyte-specific Fgf21-knockout (Fgf21(Hep-/-)) diabetic mice were used to reveal the involvement of FGF21 in beta cell regeneration. A BrdU tracing study was used to analyse beta cell proliferation in diabetic mice treated with GCGR mAb. RESULTS: GCGR mAb treatment improved blood glucose control, and increased islet number (db/db 1.6+/-0.1 vs 0.8+/-0.1 per mm(2), p<0.001; HFD+STZ 1.2+/-0.1 vs 0.5+/-0.1 per mm(2), p<0.01) and area (db/db 2.5+/-0.2 vs 1.2+/-0.2%, p<0.001; HFD+STZ 1.0+/-0.1 vs 0.3+/-0.1%, p<0.01) in diabetic mice. The plasma cytokine array and liver RNA sequencing data showed that FGF21 levels in plasma and liver were upregulated by GCGR antagonism. The GCGR mAb induced upregulation of plasma FGF21 levels (db/db 661.5+/-40.0 vs 466.2+/-55.7 pg/ml, p<0.05; HFD+STZ 877.0+/-106.8 vs 445.5+/-54.0 pg/ml, p<0.05) and the liver levels of Fgf21 mRNA (db/db 3.2+/-0.5 vs 1.8+/-0.1, p<0.05; HFD+STZ 2.0+/-0.3 vs 1.0+/-0.2, p<0.05) and protein (db/db 2.0+/-0.2 vs 1.4+/-0.1, p<0.05; HFD+STZ 1.6+/-0.1 vs 1.0+/-0.1, p<0.01). Exposure to plasma or hepatocytes from the GCGR mAb-treated mice upregulated the mRNA levels of characteristic genes associated with beta cell identity in cultured mouse islets and a beta cell line, and blockage of FGF21 activity by an FGF21 nAb diminished this upregulation. Notably, the effects of increased beta cell number induced by GCGR mAb were attenuated in FGF21 nAb-treated db/db mice, Fgf21(-/-) diabetic mice and Fgf21(Hep-/-) diabetic mice. Moreover, GCGR mAb treatment enhanced beta cell proliferation in the two groups of diabetic mice, and this effect was weakened in Fgf21(-/-) and Fgf21(Hep-/-) mice.

        "The prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide [1, 2]. Diabetes is a common non-communicable chronic disease arising from a dual hormone (insulin and glucagon) disorder [3–5]. Glucagon, a hormone secreted from pancreatic alpha cells, plays its physiological role by binding to glucagon receptor (GCGR) [6]. The principal target organ of glucagon is the liver, in which it promotes glycogen decomposition and gluconeogenesis thus elevating blood glucose levels [7]. Therefore, blockage of glucagon-GCGR signalling can be used as a glucose-lowering strategy. Antagonistic GCGR monoclonal antibody (mAb) has a strong hypoglycaemic effect in mouse models of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes and in people with diabetes [8–11]. Surprisingly, we and other groups found that GCGR mAb promotes beta cell regeneration in diabetic mice [8, 10, 12]. However, the mechanisms underlying this regeneration remain unclear.",
        "Several reports have demonstrated that the liver–islet axis participates in GCGR antagonism-induced alpha cell hyperplasia [13–17]. We supposed that the liver might also be involved in beta cell regeneration. The aims of this study were to identify the hepatokine induced by GCGR antagonism, and to clarify its role in beta cell regeneration. First, we investigated the effects of GCGR mAb on beta cell mass and function in two mouse models of type 2 diabetes. Next, we screened hepatokines by using the plasma cytokine array and liver mRNA sequencing data, and identified fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a potential mediator. Then, we used FGF21-neutralising antibody (nAb) to clarify whether FGF21 was involved in the effects of GCGR mAb on the expression of beta cell identity-related markers under plasma-conditional culture and hepatocyte co-culture conditions. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of GCGR mAb on beta cell regeneration in systemic Fgf21-knockout (Fgf21−/−) and hepatocyte-specific Fgf21-knockout (Fgf21Hep−/−) diabetic mice and in FGF21 nAb-treated db/db mice.",

Images were captured under Leica TCS SP8 confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) or an automatic digital slide scanner (Pannoramic MIDI; 3DHISTECH, Budapest, Hungary).",
        "For cell quantification in the immunofluorescent staining, three, four or five equally spaced sections (which covered the entire pancreas) per pancreas were imaged, the spacing between two adjacent sections was 200 μm and the total number of positive staining cells from three to six mice per group were counted manually.",
        "Eight-week-old male C57BL/6N mice were treated with 5 mg/kg GCGR mAb or human IgG for 6 weeks. Mouse plasma was collected, and primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated. Mouse beta cell line (Min6 cells) or primary mouse islets were cultured with 10% mouse plasma and 90% medium, or co-cultured with hepatocytes for 24 h, with or without FGF21 nAb (10 μg/ml). Min6 cells were verified to be of mouse origin and negative for inter-species contamination from rat or human. Mycoplasma was tested as negative using Mycoplasma PCR detection kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China).",
        "The RNA and proteins were collected, and quantitative RT-PCR and western blot were used to analyse gene and protein expression as previously described [9, 19]. The primer sequences are summarised in ESM Table 1. Before testing, positive and negative controls were used to verify the antibodies.",

        "To explore the possible mechanisms underlying the GCGR mAb-mediated regulation of beta cells, we collected plasma from the GCGR mAb- or IgG-treated mice, and used the plasma for the conditioned culture of mouse beta cell line Min6 cells or primary mouse islets. Results showed that exposure to plasma of the GCGR mAb-treated mice upregulated the expression of Ins1 (encodes insulin 1), Ins2 (encodes insulin 2), Pcsk1 (encodes prohormone convertase 1/3) and Pdx1 (encodes pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 [PDX1]) in Min6 cells (ESM Fig. 1a), and increased the mRNA levels of Gcg (encodes proglucagon) and beta cell characteristic genes, including Ins1, Ins2, Pcsk1 and Pdx1, in mouse islets (ESM Fig. 1b).",
        "The liver–alpha cell axis plays a pivotal role in GCGR mAb-induced alpha cell proliferation [13]. We supposed that factors released from the liver might also participate in beta cell regulation. Therefore, we isolated primary hepatocytes from the GCGR mAb- or IgG-treated mice, and co-cultured these hepatocytes with Min6 cells or mouse islets. Results showed that co-culture with hepatocytes from the GCGR mAb-treated mice upregulated the expression of Ins1, Ins2, Pcsk1 and Pdx1 in Min6 cells (ESM Fig. 1c), and increased the mRNA levels of Gcg, Ins1, Ins2, Pcsk1 and Pdx1 in mouse islets (ESM Fig. 1d). Collectively, these results suggested that soluble factors derived from the plasma and hepatocytes of GCGR mAb-treated mice could regulate beta cell identity in vitro.",
        "To identify the potential soluble factor that was derived from hepatocytes and secreted into plasma, we used a cytokine array kit to assess plasmatic cytokine profiles, and found ten cytokines that were upregulated >1.2-fold in the GCGR mAb-treated mice (Fig. 2a and ESM Table 2). We also analysed the liver RNA sequencing data in the public databases GSE68143 and GSE122348, and in the article published by Winther-Sorensen et al [20]. The liver RNA profiles in Gcgr-knockout or GCGR antagonist-treated mice showed a striking difference as compared with wild-type (WT) or control-treated mice, respectively. The ten proteins/genes with the highest fold increase in each dataset are shown in ESM Fig. 2. Notably, FGF21 was the only common factor observed both in our cytokine array data and in the gene expression profiles (Fig. 2b–f).\nFig. 2Screening and identification of liver-derived FGF21.

        "Subsequently, we confirmed the GCGR antagonism-induced upregulation of FGF21. ELISA analysis showed that, compared with IgG control, plasma FGF21 level was upregulated by GCGR mAb in db/db mice (661.5±40.0 vs 466.2±55.7 pg/ml, p<0.05) and HFD+STZ-induced diabetic mice (877.0±106.8 vs 445.5±54.0 pg/ml, p<0.05) (Fig. 2g,j).

Similarly, FGF21 levels in plasma and liver were also increased by GCGR mAb in non-diabetic C57BL6/N mice (ESM Fig. 3).",
        "Activation of FGF receptor (FGFR) by FGF21 is dependent on the transmembrane protein β-klotho (KLB), and the function of FGF21 is mediated mainly via FGFR1c/KLB and FGFR3c/KLB [21–23]. To ascertain whether plasma and liver FGF21 could act on endocrine pancreas, we analysed the single-cell RNA sequencing data of in vitro differentiation of beta cells [24] (available in the public database GSE114412). The analysis showed that in the later stages of in vitro islet cell differentiation, FGFR1 was highly expressed in pancreatic endocrine cells, including alpha cells, beta cells and neurogenin 3-positive pancreatic endocrine progenitors (ESM Figs 4 and 5), suggesting that FGF21 might exert an effect on endocrine pancreas.",
        "Subsequently, we wanted to clarify whether the upregulated FGF21 level was involved in the GCGR mAb-induced regulation of beta cell identity. In the plasma-conditional culture experiments, the upregulated mRNA levels of Ins1, Ins2, Pcsk1 and Pdx1 in either Min6 cells or mouse islets induced by exposure to plasma of the GCGR mAb-treated mice were attenuated by addition of FGF21 nAb (Fig. 3a,b). In the hepatocyte co-culture studies of Min6 cells or mouse islets, FGF21 nAb displayed similar effects (Fig. 3c,d). These results proved that liver-derived FGF21 participated in the GCGR mAb-mediated regulation of beta cell identity in vitro.\nFig. 3Regulation of beta cell identity by GCGR mAb in vitro.

        "To determine whether FGF21 plays a role in GCGR mAb-induced beta cell regeneration in vivo, Fgf21−/− and WT diabetic mice were treated with GCGR mAb or IgG. Body weight was comparable among the four groups (Fig. 4a). GCGR mAb significantly lowered fasting blood glucose level and improved glucose tolerance in WT and Fgf21−/− mice (Fig. 4b,c), indicating that FGF21 was not a key mediator in the GCGR mAb-induced hypoglycaemic effect. Fgf21−/− mice displayed higher fasting blood glucose and poorer glucose tolerance as compared with WT mice on the same treatment (Fig. 4b,c), suggesting that FGF21 itself participated in glucose homeostasis. Compared with IgG control treatment, fasting glucagon level was increased by GCGR mAb in WT mice (1537.0±165.7 vs 81.9±16.0 ng/l, p<0.01) and Fgf21−/− mice (1744.0±480.8 vs 81.1±17.2 ng/l, p<0.01) (Fig. 4d). The fold change induced by GCGR mAb was comparable between Fgf21−/− and WT mice, suggesting that FGF21 did not affect the GCGR mAb-mediated upregulation of glucagon secretion. GCGR mAb upregulated plasma insulin levels in WT mice (1026.0±72.3 vs 577.8±80.3 pmol/l, p<0.05) but this increment disappeared in Fgf21−/− mice (554.7±97.0 vs 435.9±112.2 pmol/l, p=0.80) (Fig. 4e), indicating that FGF21 participated in the upregulating effect of insulin secretion induced by GCGR mAb. Compared with IgG control, GCGR mAb increased islet numbers in WT mice (1.3±0.2 vs 0.5±0.1 per mm2, p<0.001) and Fgf21−/− mice (1.1±0.2 vs 0.5±0.1 per mm2, p<0.01), with no difference in the fold change between Fgf21−/− and WT mice (Fig. 4f,g). GCGR mAb increased islet area (1.3±0.2 vs 0.4±0.1%, p<0.001), alpha cell number (119.0 [89.0–179.0] vs 33.0 [21.5–49.0], p<0.001) and beta cell number (133.0 [96.0–152.0] vs 94.0 [70.5–118.0], p<0.001) in WT mice (Fig. 4f,h–k). In Fgf21−/− mice, GCGR mAb could still increase islet area (0.9±0.1 vs 0.4±0.1%, p<0.05) and alpha cell number (83.0 [43.0–124.0] vs 27.0 [16.0–36.0], p<0.001), albeit these increments were smaller in Fgf21−/− mice than in WT mice. Notably, GCGR mAb could not increase beta cell number (46.0 [26.0–71.5] vs 58.0 [31.0–81.0], p=0.16) in Fgf21−/− mice (Fig. 4i,k). These results suggest that FGF21 is involved in the promoting effects of GCGR mAb on islet regeneration, especially beta cell regeneration.\nFig. 4Metabolic variables, hormone levels and pancreatic histological analysis in systemic Fgf21-knockout diabetic mice treated with GCGR mAb or human IgG control for 6 weeks.

        "To exclude the effect of constitutive Fgf21 knockout on islet development, we used FGF21 nAb for non-genetic blockage of FGF21 in db/db mice, and verified the involvement of FGF21 in GCGR mAb-induced beta cell regeneration. Body weight among the four groups (control, GCGR mAb, GCGR mAb+FGF21 nAb and FGF21 nAb treatments) was comparable (Fig. 5a). GCGR mAb significantly lowered fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance in db/db mice but the glucose-lowering effect was not abolished by adding FGF21 nAb (Fig. 5b,c), suggesting that FGF21 does not participate in the GCGR mAb-induced hypoglycaemic effect. GCGR mAb upregulated plasma glucagon and insulin levels (glucagon 5921.0±1254.0 vs 294.4±110.6 ng/l, p<0.001; insulin 2667.0±328.7 vs 1108.0±228.8 pmol/l, p<0.001), and these effects were attenuated by addition of FGF21 nAb (glucagon 1304.0±276.2 vs 5921.0±1254.0 ng/l, p<0.001; insulin 1463.0±201.0 vs 2667.0±328.7 pmol/l, p<0.01) (Fig. 5d,e), indicating that FGF21 participated in the upregulating effect of glucagon and insulin secretion induced by GCGR mAb. GCGR mAb increased islet number (1.6±0.1 vs 0.9±0.2 per mm2, p<0.01), islet area (2.4±0.2 vs 1.1±0.2%, p<0.001) and alpha cell number (24.0 [17.0–47.5] vs 5.0 [2.0–13.0], p<0.001), and these effects were attenuated by combined treatment with FGF21 nAb (islet number 1.0±0.1 vs 1.6±0.1 per mm2, p<0.05; islet area 1.6±0.2 vs 2.4±0.2%, p<0.05; alpha cell number 10.0 [4.0–29.0] vs 24.0 [17.0–47.5], p<0.001) (Fig. 5f–j).

        "Liver is the main source for the circulating FGF21 pool. To clarify whether liver-derived FGF21 had a dominant effect on beta cell regeneration, Fgf21Hep−/− mice and their littermate Flox diabetic mice were treated with GCGR mAb or IgG. Similar to the findings in Fgf21−/− diabetic mice, body weight was comparable among the four groups (Fig. 6a). GCGR mAb significantly lowered fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance in Flox mice after 6 weeks of treatment but these effects were attenuated in Fgf21Hep−/− mice (Fig. 6b,c). Fasting glucagon levels were increased similarly by GCGR mAb in Flox mice (966.5±56.5 vs 101.3±23.2 ng/l, p<0.001) and Fgf21Hep−/− mice (757.0±135.6 vs 124.4±31.5 ng/l, p<0.001) (Fig. 6d). GCGR mAb appeared to upregulate plasma insulin level in Flox mice (673.9±142.4 vs 393.3±47.1 pmol/l, p=0.09), while there was no sign of the increment in Fgf21Hep−/− mice (271.5±57.2 vs 241.0±22.9 pmol/l, p=0.98) (Fig. 6e). Compared with IgG control treatment, GCGR mAb treatment increased islet number (1.8±0.2 vs 0.5±0.1 per mm2, p<0.001), islet area (1.6±0.2 vs 0.5±0.1%, p<0.001), alpha cell number (69.0 [32.0–102.0] vs 31.0 [16.0–50.0], p<0.001) and beta cell number (187.0 [96.5–289.0] vs 65.0 [44.0–142.0], p<0.001) in Flox mice (Fig. 6f–k). In Fgf21Hep−/− mice, although GCGR mAb increased islet number (1.1±0.1 vs 0.5±0.1 per mm2, p<0.01), islet area (0.8±0.1 vs 0.3±0.1%, p<0.05) and alpha cell number (57.0 [33.5–99.0] vs 27.0 [15.0–39.3], p<0.001), the GCGR mAb-induced fold change in islet number and islet area was much smaller than that in Flox mice. Notably, GCGR mAb did not increase beta cell number in Fgf21Hep−/− mice (40.0 [23.5–98.5] vs 63.0 [36.5–90.5], p=0.08) (Fig. 6k). These results suggest that liver-derived FGF21 participates in the promoting effects of beta cell regeneration induced by GCGR mAb.\nFig. 6Metabolic variables, hormone levels and pancreatic histological analysis in hepatocyte-specific Fgf21-knockout diabetic mice treated with GCGR mAb or human IgG control for 6 weeks.

        "To investigate whether FGF21 mediated the proliferation-promoting effect, we detected BrdU+insulin+ cells in islets of Fgf21−/− and Fgf21Hep−/− diabetic mice treated with GCGR mAb or IgG. Histological analysis showed that the proportion of BrdU+insulin+ cells was significantly increased by GCGR mAb in WT mice (7.0±0.8 vs 3.2±0.4%, p<0.01) but not in Fgf21−/− mice (4.3±0.6 vs 3.2±0.5%, p=0.61) (Fig. 8a,b).

        "In this study, we demonstrated that inhibition of glucagon activity by GCGR mAb not only improved blood glucose control but also increased pancreatic beta cell mass and proliferation in mouse models of type 2 diabetes. Exposure to plasma or hepatocytes from GCGR mAb-treated mice could regulate beta cell identity in vitro. By using plasma cytokine array and liver RNA sequencing data, we observed that FGF21 levels in plasma and liver were upregulated by GCGR antagonism, and confirmed this by ELISA, quantitative RT-PCR and western blot in diabetic mice treated with GCGR mAb. Notably, addition of an FGF21 nAb diminished the GCGR mAb-mediated regulation of beta cell identity in vitro, and the effect of increased beta cell mass induced by GCGR mAb was attenuated in FGF21 nAb-treated db/db mice, Fgf21−/− diabetic mice and Fgf21Hep−/− diabetic mice. These results suggested that FGF21 contributed to GCGR mAb-induced beta cell regeneration in diabetic mice.",
        "We and other groups have shown that GCGR mAb promotes beta cell regeneration in diabetic mice [8, 10, 12]. Therefore, the possible mechanism for beta cell regeneration induced by GCGR mAb is an important question. GCGR displays the highest abundance in liver. The metabolic phenotypes of liver-specific and systemic Gcgr-knockout mice are similar [15]. Our results showed that exposure to plasma or hepatocytes from the GCGR mAb-treated mice regulated beta cell identity in vitro. This suggests the existence of some soluble factors derived from the liver following the GCGR antagonism that could act on the endocrine pancreas and regulate islet regeneration. Here, we identified FGF21 as a potential mediator and proved that FGF21 levels in plasma and liver were upregulated by GCGR mAb. Similarly, previous studies reported that circulating and liver FGF21 levels are upregulated, contributing to diabetes resistance, in systemic and liver-specific Gcgr-knockout mice [20, 25]. In this study, we found that FGF21 was involved in glucose homeostasis, consistent with previous reports [26–28]. However, our study indicated that FGF21 had little involvement in the hypoglycaemic effect of GCGR mAb. A previous publication reported that hyperglucagonaemia and alpha cell hyperplasia remained to be observed in FGF21-deficient mice treated with REGN1193, another GCGR mAb [29]. The observations, in accordance with our findings, suggested that FGF21 had little effect on GCGR mAb-induced alpha cell hyperplasia.",
        "Subsequently, we evaluated whether FGF21 contributed to beta cell identity in vitro and beta cell regeneration in vivo. We showed that exposure to plasma or hepatocytes from GCGR mAb-treated mice upregulated the expression of Ins1, Ins2, Pcsk1 and Pdx1 in a mouse beta cell line and primary mouse islets, and that these effects were attenuated by addition of an FGF21 nAb. These results suggested that FGF21 was involved in regulation of beta cell identity by GCGR mAb. Moreover, we observed that GCGR mAb increased beta cell mass and proliferation (a main source of regenerated beta cells in adult rodents [30]) in WT and Flox diabetic mice, while these effects were attenuated in Fgf21−/− and Fgf21Hep−/− diabetic mice, suggesting that FGF21 contributed to the promoting effect of GCGR mAb on beta cell regeneration. Consistently, a previous study reported that FGF21 promoted transdifferentiation of alpha cells to beta cells, as indicated by upregulation of PDX1 and neurogenin 3 protein levels and increment of glucagon+PDX1+ cells, in cultured beta cell-ablated islets [31]. Besides, FGF21 increased insulin content in primary islets in a rat model of type 2 diabetes [32] and increased beta cell number in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes [33, 34]. In addition, our single-cell RNA sequencing data for islet cell differentiation indicated that FGFR1 was highly expressed in pancreatic endocrine cells, including alpha cells, beta cells and pancreatic endocrine progenitors, further supporting the concept that FGF21 participates in beta cell regeneration. Collectively, these observations suggest that FGF21 exerts beneficial effects on beta cells, and our findings highlight the importance of liver-derived FGF21 for beta cell regeneration.",
        "A limitation of our study is that we identified only FGF21 as an important cytokine involved in GCGR mAb-induced beta cell regeneration but there might be other cytokines and metabolites that contribute to beta cell regeneration under this condition. For instance, the cytokine arrays clearly showed that other soluble factors were regulated by GCGR mAb, suggesting that they might also play a role in the process. However, FGF21 was the only common factor observed both in our cytokine array data and in the gene expression profiles. Besides, increment in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is one of the well-characterised consequences of GCGR antagonism [35–37]. Our previous studies found that plasma GLP-1 level, and intestinal and pancreatic GLP-1 production, were robustly upregulated by GCGR mAb [9, 38]. GLP-1 could exert various protective effects on beta cells, including promotion of beta cell proliferation and survival [39, 40]. Therefore, GLP-1 might be involved in the promoting effects of beta cell regeneration and insulin secretion induced by GCGR mAb. Investigations in systemic and pancreas-specific Glp1r-knockout mice will help answer this question. Furthermore, glucagon is a critical regulator of amino acid homeostasis, and amino acids in turn regulate alpha cell function and proliferation [13, 17, 41, 42]. Therefore, amino acid metabolism linked to the liver–alpha cell axis may also play an important role in GCGR mAb-induced beta cell regeneration. Another limitation is that we only used constitutive knockout mice, whereas inducible knockout mice might be more suitable to exclude the effect on islet development and avoid compensation. In addition, supplementation experiments with FGF21 in Fgf21−/− or Fgf21Hep/− mice are necessary to prove the involvement of FGF21 in GCGR mAb-induced beta cell regeneration. Nevertheless, we used an FGF21 nAb to realise non-genetic blockage of FGF21 and this confirmed our findings in Fgf21−/− and Fgf21Hep/− mice.",
        "In conclusion, our study demonstrates that GCGR mAb not only ameliorates hyperglycaemia but also increases functional beta cell mass in mouse models of type 2 diabetes, and that these effects are at least partly mediated via liver-derived FGF21. Our study reveals a novel mechanism of beta cell regeneration regulated by alpha cell glucagon–liver FGF21 axis in diabetic mice.",

    "title": "A p21-ATD mouse model for monitoring and eliminating senescent cells and its application in liver regeneration post injury. Studies utilizing mouse models for cell lineage tracings have emphasized the importance of senescence heterogeneity in different organs and cell types. Here, we constructed a p21- (Akaluc - tdTomato - Diphtheria Toxin Receptor [DTR]) (ATD) mouse model to specifically study the undefined mechanism for p21-expressing senescent cells in the aged and liver injury animals. The successful expressions of these genes enabled in vitro flow cytometric sorting, in vivo tracing, and elimination of p21-expressing senescent cells. During the natural aging process, p21-expressing cells were found in various tissues of p21-ATD mice. Eliminating p21-expressing cells in the aged p21-ATD mice recovered their multiple biological functions. p21-ATD/Fah(-/-) mice, bred from p21-ATD mice and fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)(-/-) mice of liver injury, showed that the majority of their senescent hepatocytes were the phenotype of p21(+) rather than p16(+). Furthermore, eliminating the p21-expressing hepatocytes significantly promoted the engraftment of grafted hepatocytes and facilitated liver repopulation, resulting in significant recovery from liver injury. Our p21-ATD mouse model serves as an optimal model for studying the pattern and function of p21-expressing senescent cells under the physical and pathological conditions during aging. Elsevier Inc.

        "Aging presents a significant global challenge as populations continue to age. It is characterized by inevitable changes at various biological levels, including changes in the genome, cells, tissues, and entire organisms, which collectively diminish survival and reproductive capacity while increasing the risk of disease and mortality.1,2 The liver is a vital organ in the human body and is responsible for numerous functions, such as metabolic regulation, glycogen storage, drug detoxification, the synthesis of various serum proteins, and bile production.3 As individuals age, the liver experiences a range of morphological, structural, and functional changes influenced by multiple stressors, including psychological stress, viral hepatitis, alcohol consumption, pharmacological agents, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune responses.4 Furthermore, an aging liver is associated with increased vulnerability to several chronic liver diseases that are prevalent in older adults, such as hepatitis, liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis. An aging liver not only exacerbates disease prognosis but also serves as a primary risk factor for the development of chronic diseases at all stages.5 Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the indicators, causes, and underlying mechanisms of liver aging is crucial for identifying potential therapeutic targets aimed at delaying or even reversing the liver aging process and treating age-related chronic liver diseases. Determining a means of delaying or even reversing liver aging could be a research focus for the treatment of age-related chronic liver diseases in the future.",
        "Stem cells are pluripotent cells with the capacity for self-replication and the ability to differentiate into various functional cell types, and they play crucial roles in facilitating tissue repair and regeneration. The depletion of stem cells is recognized as a fundamental contributor to the aging process, as the limited number of cells produced via stem cell differentiation is insufficient to fully replace and repair damaged or senescent cells.6,7 In the liver, the primary types of hepatic stem cells include hepatic stem/progenitor cells, sinusoidal endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). These cells become activated and contribute to liver regeneration by differentiating into hepatocytes, biliary epithelial cells, or liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs).8,9 Research has demonstrated that the quantity, activation, and proliferative capacity of hepatic stem/progenitor cells are significantly lower in aged mice than in their younger counterparts, leading to a marked decline in the regenerative ability of the liver.10, 11, 12 Consequently, strategies aimed at activating endogenously silenced liver stem cells to increase their proliferation and differentiation or the supplementation of exogenous stem cells capable of differentiating into liver cells may represent effective approaches to counteract liver aging, as supported by the literature.13, 14, 15, 16 With advances in stem cell isolation and in vitro culture techniques, the transplantation of exogenous stem cells has gained traction and is being explored in clinical trials for the treatment of various age-related liver diseases.17,18 Following transplantation, stem cells exhibit a propensity to rapidly colonize aged or damaged liver tissue owing to their homing abilities. Furthermore, by secreting stem cell, vascular endothelial and fibroblast growth factors, and other cytokines, these cells can ameliorate the inflammatory environment within the liver, thereby providing protection and promoting the regeneration of liver cells.18",
        "This review begins with a comprehensive examination of the characteristics and underlying causes of liver aging, along with an exploration of the mechanisms associated with this process. Subsequently, we address the advances in stem cell research aimed at combating liver aging, thereby establishing a basis for their broader clinical implementation.",
        "With age, the liver presents unique aging characteristics and undergoes a series of degenerative changes in its morphology structure, tissue, cell, and molecular level. The important hallmarks of aging liver were showed in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Hallmarks of aging liver. Hallmarks of aging liver mainly include genome instability and mutation, structural and functional changes of organelles, microenvironment alteration, telomere attrition, stem cell depletion/aging, senescence associated secretory phenotype and changes in blood markers.

        "Although studies have revealed the retention of tissue structure in aged livers, features suggesting mild hepatic injury, including reduced volume, decreased perfusion, and impaired function, have been observed in aged human livers.19 Morphologically, the livers of elderly individuals are not smaller than those of younger individuals; however, microscopic observations show that older people have fewer but larger liver cells.20 Brown atrophy has been observed in the livers of older individuals due to the accumulation of lipofuscin within hepatocytes. In the livers of healthy elderly animals, features suggesting mild hepatic injury, including cytoplasmic vacuolation, nuclear pyknosis, cytoplasmic hypereosinophilia, diminished intercellular borders, and increased lipid accumulation were observed in aged rats.21 Moreover, a slight change in the phenotype of hepatic sinusoidal cells resulted in a minute increase in hepatic vascular resistance followed by a decrease in effective hepatic perfusion.21 Moreover, with increasing age the function of the liver also significantly changes, including a reduced regeneration rate, impaired drug metabolism, dysregulated lipid metabolism, glycometabolism and other nutritional metabolism disorders, and imbalanced liver-related coagulation function, which eventually lead to susceptibility to diabetes, fatty liver disease and other age-related diseases.",
        "Cellular senescence describes irreversible cell cycle arrest and is driven predominantly by telomere attrition.22 Almost all liver cells, including hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and Kupffer cells, display a senescent phenotype in both human and mouse livers of chronological age.3 Hepatocytes are parenchymal cells that can constitute up to 70%–80% of the total mass of the liver and are responsible for most hepatic functions. Chen et al.23 noted that the accumulation of senescent parenchymal hepatocytes is a serious threat to liver health that can aggravate liver inflammation through the secretion of a variety of inflammatory factors, thus impairing the normal physiological functions of the liver and promoting the occurrence of chronic liver diseases, such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Moreover, in a manner specific to aging, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells present a dysfunctional phenotype with diminished vasodilator synthesis, hepatic macrophages exhibit a pro-inflammatory state, and hepatic stellate cells spontaneously display an activated profile.21 Here, we take hepatocytes as an example to illustrate the cellular changes associated with liver aging.",
        "The nucleus serves as a repository of genetic information and a regulatory hub for cellular metabolism and heredity, and it undergoes substantial changes during the process of cellular senescence. Notably, the morphology and structural framework of the nucleus in senescent liver cells are significantly modified. For example, the phenomenon of nuclear vacuolation and the presence of enlarged nuclei have been documented in the context of hepatocyte senescence.24 Compared with their younger counterparts, aged hepatocytes present diminished rates of DNA synthesis and repair, alongside increased levels of genomic instability, which are the primary driving factor of liver aging.3",
        "Furthermore, the epigenetic networks of senescent hepatocytes undergo substantial modifications, which are reflected in the regulation of gene expression and a variety of intricate processes influenced by the aging process. These modifications include DNA methylation, transcription factors, histone markers, nucleosome positioning, and non-coding RNA and microRNA expression.3 The changes in DNA methylation that are observed during hepatic aging align with the concept of the epigenetic clock, which denotes a conserved pattern of age-related changes in DNA methylation. These changes are correlated with variations in gene expression, particularly in the expression of genes that are involved pathways related to inflammation, metabolism, and Wnt signaling.25,26",
        "The aging liver undergoes numerous modifications within its transcriptional network including significant changes in forkhead box O (FOXO), a crucial transcription factor associated with the aging process.27, 28, 29 FOXO may play a role in mediating hepatocyte senescence through its regulation of oxidative stress, age-related inflammation, or the activation of HSCs.3,30,31 Histone deacetylases, specifically Hdac3, Hdac1, and Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), are integral to the process of liver aging, with Hdac3 potentially serving as a pivotal regulator of the epigenetic and metabolic alterations that occur during chronological aging.32 Research indicates that the occupancy of nucleosomes in the liver diminishes with age and this age-dependent change is related to the binding sites of nucleosomes to known regulators (forkhead transcription factor and nuclear receptors: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and liver X receptor alpha (LXRα)) and nuclear layer-related candidates (Hdac3 and serum response factor (Srf)).32 Furthermore, the expression levels of various non-coding RNAs (Meg3, Neat1, Rian, and Mirg) and microRNAs (miR-34a and miR-93) in the livers of aging mice exhibit significant changes that affect inflammation, cellular proliferation, and metabolic processes.27,33",
        "Consequently, these changes in liver transcriptome regulation involve three primary sets of interacting networks: genes involved in inflammation, genes involved in proliferative homeostasis (between cellular proliferation and death networks) and genes involved in lipid metabolism (synthesis and oxidation) in the mouse liver. These networks further contribute to the development of liver aging phenotypes, decreased liver function, and aging-related diseases.27",
        "Ultrastructural analysis of the aging liver revealed structural and functional changes in the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and lysosomes.34,35 The changes observed in mitochondria during hepatocyte aging are particularly pronounced. These changes include a reduction in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, dissociation of ATP synthase, and an increase in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which ultimately leads to damage to mitochondrial DNA and respiratory chain complexes.3 In a mouse model of premature aging, structural modifications in mitochondria as well as age-related dissociation of ATP synthase dimers have been documented.36 Moreover, increased numbers of damaged mitochondria, lysosomes, and lipid deposits were observed in the liver cells of older animals and were increased in Apo E-deficient animals.37 This may explain why the ability of the mitochondria to metabolize fatty acids efficiently is lost in senescent cells, resulting in lipid deposition that drives hepatic steatosis.38",
        "The ER is an organelle that is integral to cellular growth and metabolic processes. The ER experiences both structural and functional alterations as the liver ages. Research indicates that both the rough and smooth ER decrease with increasing age, which is associated with challenges in protein synthesis and folding.35,39 Furthermore, components of the ER stress signaling pathway interact with traditional pathways related to aging.40 For example, the activation of ER stress pathways has been shown to increase hepatic glucose production in response to pyruvate stimulation and hyperglycaemia in aged rats.40",
        "Lysosomes primarily mediate the degradation of proteins and organelles via the autophagy pathway and are closely related to cellular quality control because of their role as part of the network that regulates protein homeostasis.41,42 Autophagy is crucial for the liver to regulate nutrients and metabolites.43 The number of lysosomes (primarily secondary lysosomes and residual bodies) were greater in aged rats than in young male rats.35 The overexpression of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a in the livers of aged mice could activate the autophagy pathway, resulting in impaired autophagy.44,45 Early reports on mouse liver morphology described the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and adverse autophagy responses to nutritional hormones, such as glucagon and insulin, with age.44 Damage to autophagy results in elevated levels of protein misfolding and the loss of proteostasis, leading to the formation of protein aggregates, such as lipofuscins.46,47 Furthermore, impaired autophagy contributes to the release of proinflammatory cytokines (particularly interleukin (IL)-6), which may be associated with age-related physiological dysfunctions.",
        "SASP is a general term for various factors, including inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, growth regulators, angiogenic factors and matrix metalloproteinases, secreted by senescent cells and is another typical sign of aging.48 Functionally, SASP could induce body inflammation via the autocrine and paracrine pathways and transmit aging signals to neighboring cells, which could aggravate telomere dysfunction and accelerate cell aging.49,50 In senescent human hepatocytes, the hepatocyte SASP includes characteristic factors, such as IL-8 and IL-6, and novel components, such as serum amyloid A4 (SAA4), IL-32 and fibrinogen, which further promote macrophage migration.51 Relevant phenotypes, including the overexpression of monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3)/chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 7 (CCL-7), IL-22R1, IL-10R2, IL-10, granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (GCP-2/C‒X‒C motif chemokine (CXCL)-6 and epithelial neutrophil-activating protein 78 (ENA-78)/CXCL-5, were also observed during HSC aging. IL-22 and IL-10 induce cell cycle arrest and senescence in activated HSCs by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)/p53 signaling axis.52,53 In addition, the activation of substance P (SP)/neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) axis can reduce HSC senescence.54 Multiple studies have confirmed that this secretory phenotype in HSCs is not poor because it can induce HSC senescence; however, it can restrict liver fibrosis in both human and mouse models.53,55",
        "The extracellular matrix (ECM) works together with liver cells and the nervous system to maintain homeostasis of the liver microenvironment. The ECM is secreted and regulated by cells. The function and structure of the ECM decreases with age, which is primarily manifested by changes in the ECM fiber area, rigidity and thickness, and a decrease in collagen density.35 ECM integrity is further reduced by age-related reductions in crosslinking due to the turnover of collagen crosslinking proteins.56,57 The expression of genes required for ECM formation and remodeling also differed between the liver tissues of damaged elderly and young mice. Laminin is one of the most important ECM components in hepatic oval cells and has a promoting effect on their proliferation. Studies have shown that decreased laminin expression in senescent HSCs may be related to the downregulation of genes encoding DNA-dependent protein kinase proteins.58 Moreover, liver aging alters the normal physiological function of the tissue microenvironment, affects cell proliferation and differentiation, and promotes the formation and development of tumor microenvironment. The senescent microenvironment enables pre-tumor hepatocytes to develop into hepatocellular carcinoma primarily by providing a driving force for their selective expansion.59 Normal cells in the tumor microenvironment, particularly fibroblasts and immune cells, promote tumor progression and metastasis following tissue aging.60",
        "The liver stem cell pool primarily comprises hepatic stem/progenitor cells (HPCs), HSCs, and EPCs. HPCs originate from the interface between the hepatocyte tube system and biliary tree, called the herring tube, which primarily resides in the terminal bile duct (ridge duct) between the portal vein and hepatic lobule and can differentiate into hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells.61,62 HSCs are located in the spaces between hepatic sinus endothelial cells and hepatocytes and play a role in nutritional and immunomodulatory functions,63, 64, 65 as well as in the formation of hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells.66,67 EPCs are groups of cells capable of differentiating into mature endothelial cells and promoting angiogenesis.68 In general, when present in their niche, resident EPCs play a lesser role in LSEC repopulation after liver injury. However, when resident EPCs are isolated from the liver and infused after partial hepatectomy (PHx), there is marked expansion of EPCs with persistent engraftment as LSECs and EPCs.69",
        "Both hepatic stem/progenitor cells and HSCs are activated and participate in liver regeneration by differentiating into hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells.8,9 However, several studies have shown that the number, activation, and proliferative ability of these stem cells in old mice are significantly lower than those in young mice, resulting in a significant reduction in the ability of the liver to repair itself.10,11 Conboy et al.70 reported that the proliferative ability of liver progenitor cells was reduced via the formation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP)-α and chromatin remodeling factor Brahma complexes, thus inhibiting their regenerative ability in aging livers. The regenerative ability and other functions of HSCs also decrease with age. The expression of extracellular matrix proteins, integrins, and growth factors decreases with age, whereas that of inflammatory factors increases.71 In addition, activated HSCs produce chemokines. The resultant neutrophil infiltration into the niche induces the excessive production of ROS causing decreased activation and proliferation of HPCs.10",
        "Blood, as the connector of various organs and tissues, and the medium of biological information transmission, could record the overall impact in the body caused by external stimuli, and is a commonly used biological specimen in biomedical research and clinical practice. Human serum is of great importance for organ function and the potential diagnosis of diseases. Serum biomarkers have been widely applied in clinical diagnosis and disease therapies.72, 73, 74 For liver aging, it has been found that total blood cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels increased over time as the decreased metabolism of cholesterol in the liver aging process.21 Recent investigations have suggested that serum levels of osteopontin, a senescence-associated secretory phenotype factor, were elevated while, in contrast, serum mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) levels decline with liver aging.75,76 Notably, these biomarkers are used not only to determine whether the liver is aging, but also to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-aging strategies.",
        "A pathophysiological liver can further result in liver aging in cases of genetic abnormalities, autoimmunity, iatrogenic treatment, and environmental issues. As key hereditary substances, genes play vital roles in liver aging, where age-related genes and genetic damage are triggered by gene mutations, translocations or breaks,77 telomere shortening and DNA repair system dysfunction.78,79 Livers with low renewal rates depend more on repair pathways, particularly protecting the transcribed compartment of the genome to promote sustained functionality and cell preservation.79 Therefore, DNA repair function is extremely poor in the liver. Research has shown that DNA repair defects could accelerate mouse liver aging and even result in premature death.80 Accordingly, many stimulus, including viral or non-viral hepatitis,81,82 drugs,83 radiation,84 a high-fat diet and alcohol abuse contribute to liver aging via stimulating the high expression of genes associated with aging or inducing DNA damage.85,86",
        "The immune system has evolved as a central instrument to protect against invading pathogens and is essential for tissue repair and regeneration and the identification and removal of damaged host cells.87 A decline in immune function can cause normal senescence. As a unique and important immune organ, the liver contains abundant immune cells, including T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, Kupffer, macrophage, and dendritic cells. They form the hepatic immune niche and are responsible for the maintenance of liver homeostasis and regeneration. However, with aging or various stressors, normal cells become senescent, thus rendering them difficult to clear aging or damaged cells internally and weakening the external body resistance. Consequently, senescent, and damaged immune cells accumulate and contribute to liver aging and damage due to chronic inflammation caused by inflammatory factors released by these aberrant immune cells and autoimmune attacks.88,89",
        "Environmental pollution and psychological pressure are also important factors that affect liver aging. Arsenite and hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) are common environmental pollutants associated with liver injury. Arsenite exposure induces the premature senescence of human HSCs.90 Long-term low-dose Cr (VI) exposure can induce premature cell aging via the intracellular ROS accumulation and the expressions of IL-6 and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23).91 Patients with mood disorders are more susceptible to reduced inflammation and shorter telomeres than healthy individuals, thus facilitating liver aging.92 Accumulated life stress is also associated with accelerated epigenetic aging, which may be mediated by glucocorticoid signaling.93\nFigure 2 shows the likely causes of liver aging.Fig. 2Causes of liver aging. Liver aging can be caused by many factors such as psychological pressure, viral or non-viral hepatitis, radiation, genetics, the decline of immune function, high-fat diet, alcohol, drug and environment pollution.Fig. 2",

        "The underlying mechanisms of liver aging remain poorly understood, particularly since it is a complex biological process in which a few internal and external factors interact. The combination of internal and external elements during liver degeneration causes a long and complicated biological process during liver aging. The study of liver aging is entering a new phase of inquiry owing to the rapid advancement of technology, although the precise process underlying liver aging is not yet fully understood. Oxidative stress and inflammation are now widely accepted as the primary mechanisms involved in liver aging.",
        "The liver is an important organ that relies on oxygen metabolism for energy and is susceptible to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress caused by excessive ROS and reactive nitrogen species plays a major role in liver aging.94,95 ROS are generated within mitochondria and may cause severe injury to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), including oxidative damage to mtDNA and the p53-p21 and p16-Rb pathways, thereby directly destroying mtDNA or via the synergistic action with telomerase reverse transcriptase enzymes and modification of the p53 and Ras pathway.96, 97, 98, 99 This damaged DNA accumulates with age and decreases DNA damage repair capacity, resulting in the aging of hepatocytes. Luceri et al.100 demonstrated that the increase in circulating ROS and reduced DNA damage repair capacity in the mouse liver occur as early as 15 months of middle ages. Excess ROS also contribute to the oxidative damage of other large molecules, such as proteins and lipids, inflammation, and apoptosis, which further contribute to or accelerate liver aging.77,96 Polyunsaturated fatty acids are highly sensitive to ROS and decrease the number of liver mitochondria in human centenarians, a feature acquired during evolution as a protective mechanism to favor longevity.",
        "Apart from directly inducing hepatocyte senescence, ROS overproduction can indirectly promote hepatic senescence via its direct effect on various metabolic disorders, such as Ca2+ metabolism changes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) decreases, increased adenosine 5’-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and bioenergy imbalance-mediated mitochondrial disorders.101 Moreover, ROS-induced aging involves strengthening and further amplifying the positive feedback loop of aging signaling, with ROS producing more mitochondrial mutations and ROS, which may further increase intracellular ROS, DNA damage response and ultimately, SASP.102",
        "Chronic inflammation is an important characteristic and cause of aging. In addition to SASP mentioned above, there are numerous channels, including ROS, endogenous molecular waste caused by abnormal cell death and dysbiosis caused by the microbiome and their metabolites, that can promote its production.6 Several studies have shown that some of these stimuli could induce liver aging via promoting inflammation. Persistently elevated cytokines in the liver cannot be eliminated with time, thereby causing liver organ damage and age-related liver diseases.103, 104, 105 Therefore, inflammation is recognized as an endogenous factor involved in liver aging.",
        "As previously mentioned, oxidative stress plays a vital role in the activation of transcription factors, including the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, which is responsible for regulating inflammatory gene expressions related to low-grade inflammation during aging. Zhai et al.106 reported that NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) promoted Kupffer cell inflammatory responses via ROS-NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor protein 3) to aggravate liver inflammatory injury in acute liver injury.",
        "Abnormal cell death, including necroptosis, pyroptosis and ferroptosis, is closely associated with the inflammatory aging of the liver. Mohammed et al.103 demonstrated that liver aging was associated with increased necroptosis, which contributes to chronic inflammation via the release of damage-associated molecular patterns into the liver. This phenomenon contributes to liver fibrosis and possibly to chronic liver disease. However, in the livers of old mice (particularly those aged 18 months and older), a significant upregulation of phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) and MLKL oligomers, which are markers associated with necroptosis, has been reported. In addition, the phosphorylation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and RIPK1, two key proteins involved in necroptosis signaling, was significantly increased in the livers of old mice compared to young mice. In comparison to young mice, hepatocytes and liver macrophages from old mice had higher levels of necroptosis markers and higher expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine M1 macrophage markers, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6) and fibrosis markers. In the livers of old mice, short-term treatment with the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1s reduced necroptosis, M1 macrophage markers, cellular senescence, fibrosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines.103 Notably, nerve injury-induced protein 1 (Ninjurin1/Ninj 1) played a crucial role in facilitating the breach of the plasma membrane that occurs during necroptosis, pyroptosis and secondary necrosis. Secondary necrosis referred to a phenomenon in which cells undergoing apoptosis are not engulfed by adjacent phagocytes.107 These findings suggest an age-associated dysregulation of necroptosis and signaling, thus indicating a potential role for necroptosis in aging and related pathologies. Additionally, as an important source of ROS production and inflammation, ferroptosis has been shown to be closely related to aging.108,109 In the human liver, hepatocyte senescence is positively correlated with hepatic iron concentration, serum ferritin and oxidative stress.110",
        "Although a direct relationship between microbial dysregulation and liver aging has not yet been reported, we speculate that microbial dysregulation plays an important role in this process. Several studies have reported that microbial dysregulation is related to aging, with reports that microbial dysregulation is closely related to liver disease.111, 112, 113\nTable 1 provides the biological processes associated with liver aging.3,51,78,79,96, 97, 98, 99,101, 102, 103,108,109Table 1Biological processes associated with liver aging.Table 1Biological processesSenilityEffectsReference(s)Oxidative stressDirect damageIncreasedOxidative damage to mtDNA, proteins and lipids3p53-p21IncreasedCell cycle disorder96, 97, 98, 99p16-RbIncreasedNAD+/NADH ratioReducedDecreased ETC activity101AMPKIncreasedInflammationNF-κBIncreasedInflammatory3MLKL and MLKL oligomersIncreased phosphorylated oligomersNecroptosis103RIPK3 and RIPK1Increase phosphorylationFerroptosisIncreasedCorrelated with hepatic iron concentration, serum ferritin and oxidative stress108,109OthersDNA damage responseLong-term activationCell cycle arrest102TelomereShortening and damage3,78,79Oncogene activationIncreasedDNA methylationReduced global methylationIncreased methylation of: Polycomb & tumor suppressor genesGene expression changesHistone modificationIncreased H4K16acIncreased H3K4me3Reduced H3K9me3Reduced H3K27me3Chromatin remodelingHeterochromatin relaxationIncreased HP1aLoss of PIN1Non-coding RNAsDerepression of transposonsIncreased miRNA-188-3pReduced miRNA-455-3pSASPIncreasedAffect the local or even the whole-body microenvironment51Abbreviations: AMPK, 5’-monophosphate-activated protein kinase; ETC, electron transport chain; HP1a, heterochromatin protein 1 a; MLKL, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; PIN1, peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase; RIPK, receptor-interacting protein kinase; SASP, senescence-associated secretory phenotype.",

        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are frequently utilized as anti-aging stem cells within the liver. Notably, upon transplantation into the liver, MSCs exhibit a propensity to swiftly differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) and provide favourable environmental conditions by secreting various physiologically active chemicals, such as cytokines, growth factors, regulatory factors, and signal peptides. These physiological active chemicals are instrumental in mediating immunological modulation, increasing antioxidant activity, promoting autophagy, and performing other critical functions that contribute to liver anti-aging processes.114 iPSC transplantation therapy can promote hepatocyte regeneration directly or indirectly via liver progenitor cells, which are activated and participate in liver regeneration by differentiating into hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells.115 In addition, direct supplementation with liver stem cells has also demonstrated potential anti-aging abilities.116,117",
        "MSCs, which are multipotent stem cells, originate from adipose tissue, the umbilical cord blood and bone; thus, they are easily accessible. Moreover, MSCs can evade host T cell recognition and are less immunogenic because they do not express or only express negligible major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-I and MHC-II), Fas ligands and T cell co-stimulatory molecules (such as B7-1, B7-2, CD40 and CD40L).118 Therefore, MSCs are ideal for stem cell transplantation, which is a tool in regenerative medicine and a unique cell-based therapy to treat aging-associated diseases, and has been used in clinical trials for liver diseases (Table 2).Table 2The usage of different stem cells to treat different liver diseases registered in the National Clinical Trial (NCT) registry system (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov).Table 2Cell typeLiver diseasesStatusNCT No.Liver mesenchymal stem cellsDecompensated cirrhosisCompletedNCT03632148Autologous mesenchymal stem cellsLiver failureCompletedNCT00956891Liver cirrhosisUnknownNCT01499459Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cellsLiver cirrhosisCompletedNCT01342250Hepatitis B virusCompletedNCT05442437Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cellsDecompensated cirrhosisUnknownNCT05121870Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cellsLiver cirrhosisCompletedNCT05331872End-stage liver diseasesRecruitingNCT06167473End-stage liver diseasesRecruitingNCT06242405Liver cirrhosisUnknownNCT04357600Liver cirrhosisUnknownNCT01224327Acute-on-chronic liver failureUnknownNCT04822922Mesenchymal stem cellsLiver cirrhosisUnknownNCT03209986Liver cirrhosisUnknownNCT03626090Acute-on-chronic liver failureUnknownNCT03668171Acute-on-chronic liver failureUnknownNCT03863002Bone mesenchymal stem cellsLiver cirrhosisUnknownNCT00993941Allogene mesenchymal stem cellsChronic liver diseasesUnknownNCT01256125Chronic liver diseasesUnknownNCT01256138Allogenic mesenchymal stem cellsPrimary biliary cirrhosisUnknownNCT01440309Human mesenchymal stem cellsAcute-on-chronic liver failureUnknownNCT01218464Autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cellsLiver cirrhosisUnknownNCT00976287Autologous human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cellsAlcoholic liver cirrhosisUnknownNCT03838250",

        "Researchers have alleviated liver aging in mice via the use of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). BMSC transplantation significantly improved histopathology, survival, and intestinal structural integrity in a mouse model of liver injury.119 Yang et al.120 reported that when MSCs are transmitted to young and aged mice with liver injury, more MSCs are recruited in aged mice. This result primarily occurred because of increased inflammation stimulated by hyperactivation and hyperfunction of Kupffer cells. BMSC treatment alleviated inflammatory infiltration and fibre deposition in the livers of aged mice, primarily by inhibiting the secretion of SASPs, increasing the release of growth factors, reducing expression length, and decreasing oxidative stress.14 Furthermore, distinct immunomodulatory effects have been observed in the treatment of liver injury with MSCs.116",
        "Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) have also been used in anti-aging mouse models. An extended lifespan and enhanced liver function were observed following ADMSC treatment of hepatocyte organoids.117 Additionally, improved liver function, decreased cell senescence, and suppressed secretion of inflammatory agents were observed following ADMSC treatment in a naturally aged mouse model.121",
        "Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) are another commonly used stem cell type for the treatment of liver aging because they are readily available, and they can be collected by safe and painless procedures.122 Yan et al.123 reported that through the activation of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1), human UCMSCs could upregulate ERK1/2 and Bcl-2, downregulate the IkappaB kinase subunit beta (IKKB)/NF-κB/casp-9/3 pathway, reduce liver ROS, and inhibit oxidative stress-induced apoptosis to exert a protective effect against liver damage. Morphological analysis revealed that human UCMSCs ameliorated structural disorders and the levels of markers of senescence and genome instability in aged livers. Improved metabolic reprogramming and increased intracellular communication associated mainly with phosphorylated HSP90β in hepatocytes were observed after human UCMSC treatment in naturally aging livers.124 In addition, Zhang et al.125 reported that UCMSCs could reduce the expression of senescence-associated markers in the liver and stimulate liver regeneration in aged mice subjected to two-thirds PHx via the extracellular vesicles (UCMSC-EVs) they secrete. Mechanistically, these effects of UCMSC-EVs are partially attributed to the induction of Atg4B-related mitophagy via the transfer of DDX5 to regulate the E2F1-Atg4B signaling pathway. Moreover, another research team confirmed that UCMSC-derived exosomes have antioxidant effects and alleviate oxidative stress-induced cell damage and aging by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby increasing p21 protein expression while decreasing Lamin B1 protein expression.126 Collectively, these studies confirm the potential application of the secretome of MSCs to address liver aging.",
        "In addition, MSCs from other sources also have the potential to inhibit liver aging. For example, it was reported that MSCs taken from human exfoliated deciduous teeth could rejuvenate the senescent state of the liver in naturally aged mice by improving ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins.127",
        "These findings offer promising preliminary evidence for the therapeutic potential of MSCs for aging livers; however, additional research is needed to determine their safety and efficacy in clinical settings. Notably, the ability of MSCs to self-renew is limited by donor age and invasive collection methods, such as liposuction and bone marrow aspiration, which should be considered in practical clinical applications.128",
        "iPSCs can be generated from adult cells through gene reprogramming with ectopic expression of specific pluripotency factors: octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), SRY-box transcription factor 2 (Sox2), kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC).129 The multipotency and self-renewal ability of these reprogrammed cells are like those of embryonic stem cells but are more commonly used because the latter is limited by ethics.130,131 iPSCs can self-renew and develop into a plethora of specialized cells making it attractive sources for cell therapies for regenerative medicine, various diseases, and injuries.",
        "Back in 2011, Lapasset and colleagues132 reported that after the cells of the elderly were processed into iPSCs, the telomere, gene expression profile, oxidative stress state, and mitochondrial youth were close to that of the embryonic period; If these iPSCs are induced to differentiate, completely young specialized cells can be obtained, provide new insights into iPSCs and pave the way for regenerative medicine for aged patients. iPSCs transplantation theoretically regenerates HLCs, thus serving as a cell source for liver senescence repair.12,133 Yang et al.134 confirmed that hepatocytes could be differentiated from human iPSCs and used to test therapies for familial hypercholesterolemia. Generation of HLCs using iPSC technology has been reviewed to be fundamentally beneficial for treatment of severe liver disease, screening for drug toxicities, in liver transplantation, as well as to facilitate basic research.135,136 As a conclusion, the HLCs, generated from human iPSCs, exhibit hepatocytic properties in vitro; however, their engraftment and functionality in vivo remain unsatisfactory. Therefore, clinical applications of iPSCs have not yet been reported. Moreover, the three major challenges: tumorigenicity, immunogenicity, and heterogeneity also limited its further clinical application.136",
        "Given their homology with the body, the direct in vitro supplementation of healthy liver-derived liver stem cells would be a potential strategy because they may avoid immune rejection problems compared to that for non-liver stem cells. Numerous studies have reported that liver stem cells can generate mature hepatocytes in vitro and repair and regenerate the liver following transplantation into injured livers.137,138 Sandhu et al.139 reported that the transplantation of fetal liver epithelial progenitor cells could regrow in the recipient liver under PHx alone or in combination with reverse transcriptase in rats with a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) mutation. Similarly, delta-like 1 (Dlk)+ stem/progenitor cells purified from rat fetal liver during the second trimester were able to extensively regenerate in the host liver of homologous DPPIV mutant rats under PH alone.140 In addition, the transplantation of hepatoprogenitor cells isolated from human fetal liver into immune-permitted mice for up to 36 weeks demonstrated that the transplantation of hepatoprogenitor cells into injured livers retained functional roles in liver repair and regeneration and reduced liver fibrosis in mice.141 Under certain conditions, fetal stem/progenitor cells can rebuild the adult liver. Additionally, mouse oval and HSC transplantation can achieve liver regeneration.66,142",
        "In addition to stem cell grafting, the activation of endogenous cells in certain regions of the body has the potential to mediate regeneration during aging.143,144 As mentioned earlier, the decreased activation and proliferation ability of liver stem cells is a hallmark of liver aging, thus reducing the liver self-repairing capability. Therefore, restoring the activation and proliferation activities of liver stem cells is a potential strategy for repairing liver damage and delaying liver aging.",
        "DR generally defined as reducing caloric intake without malnutrition, has been shown to extend the lifespan of all species tested.145,146 To figure out why, researchers have found that DR exerts direct effects on endogenous adult stem cells, notably increasing stem cell functionality in the intestine and skeletal muscle as well as increasing hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, thereby improving body function, or restoring vitality or resisting aging.147, 148, 149 Recently, research from University of California has shown that DR also has a positive effect on liver stem cells, and it can revert the liver circadian genomic signatures of aging, which helps to reverse the aging of liver tissue.149",
        "Exercise is known to be another excellent approach that can act directly on endogenous stem cells to achieve anti-aging and combat a variety of age-related diseases.150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155 Liu et al.156 affirmed that exercise ameliorated the upregulation of several inflammatory pathways associated with old age and restored aspects of intercellular communication mediated by immune cells within stem cell compartments in muscle and neural as well as hematopoietic stem cells, which contributed to anti-aging. Brett et al.157 also found that exercise can rejuvenate quiescent skeletal muscle stem cells in old mice through the restoration of Cyclin D1. Although the direct effect of exercise on liver stem cells has not been reported, its effective intervention in liver diseases indirectly confirms its positive effect on liver stem cells, because the abnormality of the latter is also the cause or characteristic of liver disease.158, 159, 160",
        "In addition to the cell-extrinsic interventions discussed above, including dietary manipulations or exercise, that can enhance tissue regeneration with age. Recent studies have explored the possibility that cells can be “reprogrammed” intrinsically to adopt a more youthful phenotype, leading to enhanced tissue repair in older organisms. With the advent of iPSC technology, it was proposed that the restoration of aged cells to a more youthful state may occur by a process of “epigenetic rejuvenation”.161,162 In especial, although sustained expression of factors Oct4,Sox2,Klf4, and MYC (OSKM) leads to cell dedifferentiation and teratoma formation, brief and limited expression restores youthful characteristics to cells and tissues. Chondronasiou et al.163 demonstrated that a single period of OSKM expression could drive epigenetic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic changes toward a younger configuration in the liver. Apart from OSKM factors, some other small molecules possess hepatic stem cell reprogramming capabilities. Mitra et al.15 found that reprogramming, when mediated by a small-molecule hedgehog agonist, HhAg1.5, could break the latency of non-insured liver stem cells to rescue liver failure. Dai et al.16 found that growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) could alleviate liver fibrosis via the expansion of liver progenitor cells.",
        "Noteworthily, besides regeneration, liver progenitor cell proliferation also determines the emergence of a ductal response, which is associated with progressive portal vein fibrosis, thus suggesting a complex link between liver progenitor cell activation and fibrosis.13 Moreover, the infinite expansion of liver progenitor cells can also differentiate into cancer cells and promote tumor formation via the release of complement C1q by macrophages in small inflammatory sites to activate the unorthodox signal of β-catenin pathway of the HPCs around the portal vein.164,165",
        "Paradoxically, these cells are HSCs, and their activation can help the proliferation and maintenance of hepatocytes through the release of retinoid and various growth factors to achieve liver regeneration.166 In the damaged liver, activated HSCs differentiate into myofibroblasts, which are involved in the progression of fibrosis and cirrhosis.167",
        "In conclusion, a key step in achieving liver regeneration and anti-aging is exploiting the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells to promote liver regeneration without causing liver fibrosis or inducing side effects in cancer cells. However, this probabilistic event is challenging because accurately assessing the microenvironment of the lesion to determine whether there are conditions to induce fibrosis or differentiation into cancer cells is difficult; therefore, further research is required.",
        "In conclusion, this review systematically delineated the hallmarks, etiologies, and mechanisms associated with liver aging, thereby identifying potential therapeutic targets for the treatment or reversal of this condition. Furthermore, it examined the current advances in stem cell technology as they pertain to combating liver aging. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the field of liver stem cell biology, with notable achievements in stem cell research increasing our understanding of stem cell-mediated liver regeneration. This progress provides new directions for the application of stem cells in addressing liver aging. Although there are currently no clinical trials specifically focused on stem cell therapy for anti-liver aging, various stem cell populations each with distinct advantages and limitations, are already being utilized in clinical studies. Preclinical investigations have demonstrated the efficacy of these approaches in the context of anti-liver aging, leading us to believe that clinical trials involving stem cell therapy for this purpose are imminent.",
        "Numerous studies referenced in this review used MSCs as a therapeutic approach. This strategy is clinically relevant because of the low immunogenicity and relative accessibility of MSCs; however, meticulous scrutiny is needed. Although MSCs can be derived from various sources, the optimal source for addressing anti-liver aging remains to be conclusively determined. Recent investigations indicating the generation of antibodies against and immune rejection of allogeneic donor MSCs suggest that these cells may not possess true immune privilege.168 Furthermore, the inherent immunogenicity of MSCs can elicit an immune response upon transplantation, potentially resulting in the destruction and clearance of the transplanted cells, thereby diminishing both the survival rate and functional maintenance of the stem cells posttransplantation. Additionally, MSCs are inherently affected by aging, which can significantly impair their inhibitory efficacy.169, 170, 171 iPSCs have several theoretical advantages; however, further research is essential to elucidate their pluripotency and associated tumorigenic risks. While liver stem cells exhibit promising potential for regenerating aged liver tissue in animal models, few studies have investigated their application in liver transplantation. The methodologies for the extraction, purification, and in vitro culture of liver stem cells are not yet sufficiently advanced, and transplantation techniques have yet to be established. Consequently, further investigations are warranted in this area.",
        "In the field of fundamental research on the use of stem cell therapy for liver aging, it has been observed that the stem cells themselves may not play a predominant role; rather, paracrine mediators are considered crucial to the functionality of stem cells. This led to the conception of cell-free therapy. Among the various cell-free strategies, stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (SC-EVs), commonly referred to as exosomes, have garnered significant attention. These vesicles capitalize on the diverse array of molecules secreted by stem cells into the culture medium, including soluble proteins, free nucleic acids, lipids, and EVs, which have the potential to effectively repair tissue damage in response to changes in physiological or pathological conditions. Increasing evidence suggests that exosomes derived from MSCs may represent a viable cell-free alternative, offering considerable advantages over parent MSCs, particularly in terms of the reduced risk of tumorigenesis and lower immunogenicity.170 However, it is unfortunate that no clinical trials to date have utilized SC-EVs for liver treatment. This limitation is primarily explained by the absence of a standardized method for the extraction of large quantities of EVs or exosomes, as well as the unclear parameters regarding their dosage and half-life.",
        "Numerous studies have focused on improving the homing capacity of transplanted stem cells to augment their therapeutic efficacy, primarily addressing four key areas. (i) Delivery methods: Peripheral intravenous infusion of stem cells is a straightforward, cost-effective method that allows for multiple administrations. However, this technique results in a low percentage of cells successfully colonizing the liver, making it more suitable for allogeneic stem cells. In contrast, hepatic arterial injection is considered the optimal delivery route and is the preferred method in most clinical trials.172 (ii) Pretreatment or optimization of stem cell culture conditions: A significant number of studies have investigated the optimization or pretreatment of stem cell culture conditions, demonstrating that such modifications can increase stem cell efficacy.169,173,174 Nonetheless, potential risks, including impacts on phenotype and paracrine function, must be carefully considered. (iii) Modification of stem cells: The modification of stem cells through gene editing or chemical alteration is a dynamic area of research. However, these strategies may introduce biosafety concerns, necessitating extensive preclinical investigations to assess their safety and effectiveness. (iv) Modification of target tissue: Increasing the attractiveness of target tissue appears to be a promising strategy. Research has shown that the administration of homing factors into target tissue, genetic modifications of the target tissue, and the application of radiation or ultrasound techniques can improve the homing of MSCs. However, few studies have specifically addressed liver disease in this context.",
        "Overall, the strategy of stem cell infusion has significant potential for the prevention and treatment of age-related liver conditions from various perspectives. Furthermore, the activation of endogenous stem cells, particularly through systemic interventions such as DR and physical exercise, represents a feasible approach that is largely applicable in clinical settings. The mechanisms underlying these strategies at both the cellular and molecular levels have been elucidated in the literature.175, 176, 177 The roles of DR and exercise in the context of liver aging are discussed above. The exploration of the application of diet and exercise programs in different populations is a direction that needs to be considered in the future.",

    "title": "Proliferation‑inhibiting pathways in liver regeneration (Review). mechanism following liver injury caused by various factors. The process of liver regeneration consists of three stages: Initiation, proliferation and termination. Proliferation‑promoting factors, which stimulate the recovery of mitosis in quiescent hepatocytes, are essential in the initiation and proliferation steps of liver regeneration. Proliferation‑promoting factors act as the 'motor' of liver regeneration, whereas proliferation inhibitors arrest cell proliferation when the remnant liver reaches a suitable size. Certain proliferation inhibitors are also expressed and activated in the first two steps of liver regeneration. Anti‑proliferation factors, acting as a 'brake', control the speed of proliferation and determine the terminal point of liver regeneration. Furthermore, anti‑proliferation factors function as a 'steering‑wheel', ensuring that the regeneration process proceeds in the right direction by preventing proliferation in the wrong direction, as occurs in oncogenesis. Therefore, proliferation inhibitors to ensure safe and stable liver regeneration are as important as proliferation‑promoting factors. Cytokines, including transforming growth factor‑beta and interleukin‑1, and tumor suppressor genes, including p53 and p21, are important members of the proliferation inhibitor family in liver regeneration. Certain anti‑proliferation factors are involved in the process of gene expression and protein modification. The suppression of liver regeneration led by metabolism, hormone activity and pathological performance have been reviewed previously. However, less is known regarding the proliferation inhibitors of liver regeneration and further investigations are required. Detailed information regarding the majority of known anti‑proliferation signaling pathways also remains fragmented. The present review aimed to understand the signalling pathways that inhbit proliferation in the process of liver regeneration. University, Chongqing 400042, P.R. China.

        "Liver is the primary organ for metabolism, biosynthesis of proteins and other bioactive molecules, detoxification, xenobiotic metabolism, and bile secretion. It is also the second largest solid organ in the human body, composed of the right and left lobes. At the tissue level, the liver is subdivided into several hepatic lobules containing several cell types well organized between a central vein and the portal triad. The liver cell types display different functions and embryonal origins, including hepatocytes, stellate cells, KCs, cholangiocytes, and endothelial sinusoidal cells. Each liver cell can be affected by various etiologies, including infection, inflammatory factors, chemicals, and carcinogens, which cause different liver disorders and lead to critical health concerns.1,2 However, the liver can restore its initial mass thanks to its capacity to regenerate the tissue lost post-injury.\n3",
        "Depending on whether the loss of tissue is acute, typically observed after partial hepatectomy or mild injuries, or chronic, which generally happens in chronic liver diseases, different cellular and molecular mechanisms are activated to repair, compensate, or restore missing mass. The present review discusses cellular and molecular mechanisms governing liver regeneration and highlights the role of the most important players in promoting cell proliferation, known as “mitogens.”",
        "The high regeneration potential of the liver was studied first by Higgins et al in 1931. They proposed a classic model to study hepatic regeneration in rats, where 2 out of 4 liver lobes are removed. This model has been refined and used many times to understand liver regeneration mechanisms and to improve outcomes in patients undergoing extensive liver resection for liver cancer or other underlying liver diseases.4,5 Indeed, from those studies, it has been clearly shown that the damaged liver can properly adjust its primary size to adapt to the body’s needs, a phenomenon called “hepatostat.”\n6",
        "While a few studies have suggested that liver progenitor cells (LPCs) may contribute to liver regeneration, accumulating evidence indicates that their role is minimal following partial hepatectomy, with mature hepatocyte proliferation being the predominant mechanism of liver regeneration.7–9 Hepatocytes and biliary duct epithelial cells can dedifferentiate to LPCs in the context of liver regeneration,10–12 and similar to the embryonic state, undergo the differentiation procedure once again. Going through the differentiation process can increase the risk of developing liver cancer due to the similarities among the activated signaling pathways involved in hepatogenesis and hepatocarcinogenesis. Repeated irritation in chronic conditions during pathological liver regeneration can raise the risk of cancer even further.\n13\n Several genes, signaling pathways, and proteins are involved in normal and pathological liver regeneration, which are the main focus of this article.",
        "Physiological liver regeneration occurs consequently through 2 major patterns: acute liver injury caused by xenobiotics and post-resection liver injury. Acute liver injury is defined as an acute attenuation of the liver functions due to infection, chemicals/toxins, alcohol, and flare of auto-immune diseases, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.\n14\n This injury usually occurs when the extent of the damaged tissues exceeds the liver’s regenerative capacity and is mainly associated with the massive death of hepatocytes, especially in the centrilobular area (intoxication etiologies).\n15\n and diffuse liver involvement (in viral infections) in the context of KC infiltration.\n16\n Necrosis, apoptosis, or necro-apoptosis may occur following acute liver failure.\n17\n However, following the hepatic injury, remaining healthy mature hepatocytes will regenerate the liver tissue, while activated LPCs could play a role in extended hepatic injuries with more than 50% involvement of hepatocytes.\n18\n After ALF, the primary phase of liver regeneration is the promotion of hepatocyte mitosis, which is supported by several intrahepatic and extrahepatic pathways activation.19,20 After hepatic resection, liver regeneration mainly relies on the mitosis of the remaining hepatocytes, without any involvement of the activated LPCs.\n21",
        "Physiological liver regeneration occurs immediately after hepatic injury.\n22\n In normal physiological conditions, hepatic cells are in the G0 state of the cell cycle. In response to acute liver injury or post-hepatectomy, those cells switch rapidly to the G1 phase thanks to different growth factors and cytokines called “mitogens”.23,24 At the early stage of liver regeneration, the liver mass is compensated by the remnant hepatocytes proliferation.\n25\n In addition, the increased ratio of blood flow to the liver mass will induce a shear stress on the sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), leading to a change in their phenotype by Klf-2,26,27 and an activation of the Wnt pathway. In addition, low PO2 of the portal vein can trigger liver regeneration.\n28\n In physiological liver regeneration, each hepatocyte can renew itself through simple mitosis induced by intracellular and extracellular inductions caused by mitogens.\n29",
        "Regenerative mitogens are critical for liver regeneration, including HGF and EGF receptor ligands, including EGF, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and amphiregulin. Furthermore, bile acids (BAs), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin, VEGF, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), growth hormone (GH), leptin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are accelerator mitogens. Moreover, complex pathways of mitogens, including Wnt/β-catenin and hedgehog pathways, are involved in liver regeneration.28,30 Eliminating regenerative mitogens significantly reduces hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration. However, accelerator mitogens and complex pathways are not essential for hepatocyte proliferation, and the ablation of these factors only delays the regeneration process\n31\n (Figure 1). In the following subheadings, different mitogens will be discussed thoroughly.",
        "Signaling pathways involved in physiological and pathological liver regeneration. The upper part illustrates 3 types of mitogens promoting normal liver regeneration, including regenerative (green), accelerator (yellow), and complex (blue) mitogens, and the lower part indicates mitogens (purple) stimulating pathological liver regeneration.",
        "Regenerative mitogens are involved in the initial phase of liver regeneration after hepatectomy, in which the compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining liver tissue occurs after the activation of hepatocytes. The mitogens in this phenomenon stimulate the proliferation of hepatocytes and other liver cells, leading to the restoration of liver mass. The presence of these mitogens is necessary, and their impairment causes a significant defect or even complete interruption in the regeneration process, as manifested by the delayed activation of transcription factors.",
        "HGF, firstly extracted in 1986 from rat platelets, is the most potent mitogen for hepatocytes.\n32\n HGF or scatter factor is a pleiotropic factor affecting cellular growth, motility, and morphogenesis. This essential factor for hepatocyte proliferation is locally secreted by stromal cells, including KCs, endothelial cells, and HSCs. Studies have shown that HGF levels are higher in patients without liver failure, and the sera levels of VEGF, HGF, and IL-6 have been described as promising regeneration predictive markers in mice.\n33\n In the injured liver, HSC, activated in response to reactive oxygen species, and damage-associated molecular patterns are the primary producers of HGF and thus play a vital role in liver regeneration.\n34\n Immediately post-hepatectomy, HGF is transformed by urokinase plasminogen activator into its active form\n35\n and acts through tyrosine-protein kinase Met (c-Met) receptor.\n36\n In fact, HGF binding to c-Met activates growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb-2), Grb-2-associated binder-1 (Gab-1), SHC adaptor proteins, salt overly sensitive (SOS) signaling pathway, RAS, ERK/MAPK, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which induce DNA synthesis and mitosis.\n37\n This signaling pathway is crucial for liver regeneration, and studies have shown that HGF-knockout mice exhibited defects in hepatocyte proliferation and delays in the healing process after acute liver injury or partial hepatectomy.38,39 HGF has been extensively studied in murine models, and studies have shown that HGF levels are significantly correlated with the degree of remnant liver growth before stage 2 of the associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for the staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) procedure. A preclinical study demonstrated that HGF-based gene therapy by in vivo electroporation might be useful after hepatic resection in cirrhotic livers by stimulating liver proliferative and collagenolytic capacities through activation of MAPK p44/p42 signaling pathway, as well as accelerating functional recovery.\n40",
        "Besides, cohort observational studies have indicated that regardless of the type of underlying disease and the percentage of resected tissue, a significant increase in the levels of released HGF in the peripheral blood is observed immediately after hepatectomy. However, since HGF production is a non-parenchymal cell-dependent factor, embedded mainly in the extracellular matrix (ECM), the exact amount and timing of the HGF peak are related to the percentage of the resected liver.\n41",
        "In a healthy liver, the HGF is sequestered within the ECM, which is crucial for regulating the availability of HGF for cellular signaling. Following liver injury, the rapid degradation of the ECM facilitates the release of HGF, triggering an initial wave of signaling essential for stimulating hepatocyte proliferation.\n41\n The degradation of ECM is mediated by various proteolytic enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which break down ECM components and release sequestered growth factors like HGF into the adjacent tissue. The activation of HGF is further promoted by urokinase plasminogen activator, which converts inactive HGF into its active form shortly after hepatectomy. The interaction of HGF with c-Met activates several downstream signaling pathways that are crucial for cell growth, differentiation, survival, metabolism, proliferation, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Studies indicate that knockout models lacking HGF exhibit significant defects in hepatocyte proliferation and show delayed recovery following acute liver injury or partial hepatectomy.35–37",
        "Recent studies on mechanisms related to HGF have revealed findings about its interaction with the liver microenvironment, crosstalk with other pathways, and regulation by the ECM. The liver microenvironment includes the SECs, HSCs, and KCs.\n42\n The HGF/c-MET signaling axis contributes to modulating the liver’s microenvironment through various processes, including ECM remodeling, inflammation, angiogenesis, and invasion, to promote tumor progression and metastasis.\n43\n Understanding the role of HGF in modulating these interactions and protecting non-parenchymal cells could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for liver diseases.\n42\n Given its importance in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance, the HGF/c-MET axis has emerged as a potential target for cancer treatment.\n44\n HGF/c-Met signaling also interacts with other pathways, such as JAK/STAT3, PI3K/Akt/NF-κB, and Ras/Raf, to promote cell proliferation, growth, and survival.\n45\n The Hippo pathway, particularly its coactivators YAP/TAZ, is involved in both normal and abnormal liver regeneration. During normal regeneration, YAP/TAZ activation promotes bile duct network formation and interacts with other pathways to recruit KCs and activate stellate cells. However, in chronic liver disease, prolonged YAP/TAZ activation can lead to fibrosis and an increased risk of hepatocarcinoma.\n46\n ECM components can either promote or inhibit c-MET activation by acting as bridging molecules or sequestering HGF.\n47\n The activation of plasminogen facilitates the release and activation of ECM-bound HGF.\n48\n HGF synergistically enhances myoblast migration on ECM proteins by inducing ERK phosphorylation and increasing production of MMP.\n49\n Similarly, HGF enhances MMP activity in endothelial cells by upregulating MT1-MMP synthesis and activating MMP-2.\n50\n These findings highlight the complex interactions among HGF, ECM, and MMPs in cancer progression, tissue regeneration, and angiogenesis.",
        "On the clinical side, a trial (NCT00225901) has investigated the safety and efficacy of recombinant human HGF (rh-HGF) in patients with fulminant hepatitis. It could demonstrate tolerability, but further investigations are needed to determine the effectiveness of administering exogenous HGF in the clinic.\n51\n The clinical trial NCT00225901 investigated the safety and efficacy of rh-HGF in patients with fulminant hepatitis. The results indicated that rh-HGF was generally well-tolerated by the participants; however, it highlighted the need for further investigation into its efficacy as a therapeutic agent for promoting liver regeneration. The trial NCT02083768 focuses on the safety and initial efficacy of HGF gene therapy in patients diagnosed with acute liver failure. The findings could provide valuable data on the potential benefits of gene therapy as a novel treatment approach for this condition. The clinical trial NCT03017016 evaluates the safety and efficacy of the HGF gene therapy drug HGF-ung1 specifically in patients with acute liver failure. This study employs a targeted gene therapy strategy aimed at enhancing the liver’s regenerative potential by increasing the concentration of HGF at the injury site. The outcomes are critical in determining whether HGF-ung1 can effectively promote hepatocyte proliferation and improve overall liver recovery. The current trial, NCT03924318, investigates another variant of HGF gene therapy, known as HGF-PE. This trial focuses on assessing the safety and therapeutic potential of HGF-PE in patients with liver conditions requiring regeneration. The results may provide insights into how variations in gene therapy can influence treatment outcomes and enhance liver recovery.",
        "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family that interacts with other ErbB receptors and regulates cell proliferation and growth.\n52\n Among 7 possible ligands of EGFR,\n53\n 4 of them, including TGF-α, EGF, HB-EGF, and amphiregulin, have a critical role in liver regeneration.\n54\n By binding to EGFR, the mentioned ligands will activate several intracellular pathways, including the RAS/RAF, PI3K/Akt, phospholipase Cγ, STAT3, and Src kinase pathways, involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and growth, indicating the critical role of EGFR in the initial phases of liver regeneration.\n55",
        "Considerable evidence has emerged on the importance of EGFR signaling pathways in liver inflammatory responses to injuries. Preclinical studies reported highly induced levels of EGFR in hepatocytes alongside high levels of HB-EGF, TGF-α, EGF, and amphiregulin after partial hepatectomy. This resulted from an upregulation in disintegrin and metalloproteinases-17 (ADAM-17), essential factors for the shedding of ErbB ligands.\n56\n The proliferative and survival signals of EGFR ligands were demonstrated in vivo after intraperitoneal injection of these factors.57,58 Natarajan and colleagues indicated that ErbB1 knocked-down mice showed higher mortality rates and higher serum transaminase levels, implying liver injury. Reduction in cyclin D1, cdk2, and cdk1 expression delayed cell cycle progression in the G1–S phase and consequently decreased hepatocyte proliferation. Inhibited liver regeneration resulted in increased blood TNF-α as a compensatory mechanism and extended c-Jun activation.\n59\n In another study by Paranjpe et al,\n60\n silencing the EGFR mRNA was demonstrated to be associated with a significant decrease in liver regeneration, leading to hepatic decompensation.",
        "Although EGFR ligands have been extensively studied in animal models, there is limited information on their application in clinical studies, whether they induce or accelerate liver regeneration post-hepatectomy. Considering the high rate of mortality post-hepatectomy (liver resection), more research studies regarding the application of this mitogen in boosting the compensation of lost tissues are necessary.",
        "Accelerator mitogens play a critical role in the liver tissue’s remodeling and restoring liver function, modulating the early phase of liver regeneration, and controlling the timing of essential transcription factors associated with hepatocyte proliferation. Accelerator mitogens are extracellular signals that interact and synergize with regenerative mitogens to promote liver regeneration after hepatectomy. Deprivation of accelerator mitogens would delay but not abrogate liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.",
        "BAs, mainly consisting of cholesterol, are essential for various physiological functions, such as fat digestion, cholesterol metabolism, vitamin absorption, and immune system homeostasis.\n61\n Previous studies showed that BAs are crucial metabolic compounds that promote liver regeneration through different signaling pathways. In fact, urinary BA output increases, and a fetal-type molecular species of BA reappears in the urine on day 3 and day 7 after hepatectomy. BA salts can interfere with G protein-coupled BA receptor-1 (TGR5) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR).\n62\n TGR5 is a cell surface receptor known for regulating BAs homeostasis and anti-inflammatory responses through interference with KC functions.\n63\n FXR is classified as a nuclear receptor that binds to DNA and regulates the gene expression related to the liver metabolic activity.\n64\n FXR is expressed in the liver and terminal ileum\n65\n and plays a crucial role in sustaining intrahepatic BA levels at safe concentrations and preventing BA overload’s toxic consequences. The synthesis of BAs occurs essentially by cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and requires FXR expression in the ileum and the liver.\n65",
        "After the activation of TGR5 and FXR by BAs, the quiescent hepatocytes enter the cell cycle. FXR regulates the cell cycle progression through Foxm1b, a critical factor for G1/S and G2/M progression, and the FXR/FGF19/FGFR4 signaling axis.66,67 In addition, the FXR regulates the BA concentration and prevents the apoptosis and necrosis of hepatocytes through the FGF19/FGFR4/βKlotho pathway.\n68\n In fact, FXR’s knockdown in mice causes impairment of liver regeneration.\n69\n Also, lack of TGR5 in mice is associated with high levels of BAs, severe inflammatory responses, and delayed liver regeneration.\n70\n Although BAs play a crucial role in the early stages of liver regeneration, BA overload could ultimately result in liver toxicity and delayed liver regeneration following liver resection.\n71",
        "Recent studies have highlighted the mechanisms by which NE influences liver regeneration. NE is released during sympathetic nervous system activation, and its interactions with adrenergic receptors enhance hepatocyte proliferation following liver injury. It has been shown that NE induces cell cycle and DNA synthesis through its α-adrenergic receptors\n72\n and improves liver regeneration after the antagonization of the TGF-β inhibitory effect on hepatocytes.\n73\n HSCs express adrenoceptors, produce catecholamines, and are growth-inhibited by adrenoceptor antagonists.74,75 Mice lacking NE showed reduced HSC activation and fibrogenic responses, which can be rescued by adrenoceptor agonists.\n75\n Conversely, sympathetic nervous system inhibitors enhance oval cell accumulation and may improve liver repair.\n74\n These findings suggest that the sympathetic nervous system regulates liver repair by modulating HSC and oval cell phenotypes, potentially offering novel therapeutic approaches for liver damage and fibrosis. The β2-adrenergic receptor is also involved in liver regeneration; its deletion leads to increased mortality and impaired liver function post-hepatectomy. β2-adrenergic receptor promotes liver regeneration through crosstalk with c-met and the activation of ERK signaling.\n76\n Furthermore, NE may work synergistically with other mitogens, like HGF and EGF, to amplify the regenerative response. NE enhances the mitogenic effects of EGF in the liver by interfering with α-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptors and improving hepatocyte proliferation.\n77\n Alongside the abovementioned effects, NE can increase the production of EGF and HGF by Brunner glands, the 2-key regenerative mitogens involved in liver regeneration.\n78\n Moreover, during the perioperative period of liver transplantation, NE is often administered to address hemodynamic instability and improve organ perfusion and oxygen supply. However, a retrospective cohort study of 430 children investigated the impact of NE infusion on the prognosis of pediatric living donor liver transplantation. This study indicated that intraoperative NE administration was related to poor prognosis, suggesting that NE might not be the best choice for circulatory support during pediatric living donor liver transplantation.\n79",
        "Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a critical hormone of the central nervous system that is produced by the enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract. It is deeply involved in many physiologic functions, including gastrointestinal motility, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and platelet aggregation, as well as liver functions such as hepatic energy metabolism, hepatic fibrosis, steatosis, and liver regeneration.\n80\n Furthermore, the balance between liver fibrogenesis and regeneration in chronic liver injuries appears to be primarily controlled by serotonin signaling. Serotonin is commonly carried by platelets and has been shown to promote liver regeneration in mice after injury through serotonin receptors (HTr2A and HTr2B). In thrombocytopenic mice, a serotonin agonist improved liver cell proliferation.\n81\n In addition, the expression of 5-HT2A and 2B serotonin receptors significantly increased after hepatectomy, while antagonists of 5-HT2A and 2B receptors were able to inhibit liver regeneration.\n82\n A notable study in a murine PHx model indicated the role of 5-HT in the 5-HT–pERK–YAP axis in liver regeneration.\n83\n Moreover, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors reduced the intraplatelet 5-HT concentration. A clinical study showed that perioperative selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor intake was significantly associated with a high incidence of morbidity and postoperative hepatic dysfunction.\n84",
        "VEGF is the major angiogenesis regulator and induces the transition from G0 to G1 cell cycle phase.\n85\n VEGF operates via at least 3 receptors, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3.\n86\n VEGF expression was reported to increase significantly after partial hepatectomy, and was associated with the high proliferation of SECs and hepatocytes.87,88 In the coculture of hepatocytes with SECs, VEGF enhanced the proliferation of hepatocytes and HGF expression through VEGFR-1.\n89\n Furthermore, expression of VEGFR-2, the primary regulator of the VEGF performance, increased during liver regeneration and enhanced the VEGF activity through the regeneration process.\n90",
        "It has been suggested that insulin has promising roles in liver growth and regeneration. Indeed, liver regeneration implies mitochondrial metabolic activities, strongly associated with insulin to preserve a high ketone-body ratio.\n91\n After partial hepatectomy, the uptake of insulin and glucagon is increased by hepatocytes, which induces liver regeneration.92,93 The increased endogenous insulin levels reported after 48 hours post-hepatectomy suggest the insulin heterotrophic function at the early stages of liver regeneration.\n94\n In addition, studies on the human population showed the positive effects of intraportal insulin infusion on liver graft regeneration after transplantation.\n95",
        "Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are produced in the liver in response to GH and are critical for the proliferation and differentiation of hepatocytes.\n96\n IGFs act through the IGF receptor (IGF1R) and are modulated by at least 6 different IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), which have a greater affinity to IGF compared to IGF1R and play a critical role in regulating IGF signaling.\n97\n These factors are associated with insulin functionality; however, they display a higher growth-induction capacity.\n98\n It has been shown that IGF1 stimulates the cell cycle by DNA synthesis and promotes HGF production by non-parenchymal liver cells such as HSCs.99,100 In the context of IGFBPs, IGFBP-1 is reported to be highly expressed in liver regeneration, while its deficiency is associated with abnormal liver regeneration.\n101\n Moreover, an increase in IGFBP-4 concentrations was seen 12–24 hours after a partial hepatectomy, which might be related to the modulation of IGF expression during liver regeneration.\n102\n Importantly, IGF signaling is different in normal and pathological liver regeneration. While IGF1 plays a more influential role in normal liver regeneration, IGF2 is more critical in regeneration after chronic liver injury. IGF1 induces cellular senescence, improves NASH, and reduces fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, animal studies revealed that IGF2, expressed by pericentral hepatocytes, enhances hepatocyte proliferation after pathological and chronic liver injuries.103–105",
        "GH is involved in the modulation of liver growth directly via its receptor and indirectly through IGF1 enhancement and IGF1R activation.\n106\n It was shown that GH could adjust EGFR expression and enhance EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, an essential event in liver regeneration.107,108 Blocking GH agonists has been reported to be related to a decrease in liver regeneration capacity and survival rate of the rats following partial hepatectomy.\n109\n In another study in 2021, it was shown that GH eliminates the excessive immune response observed after a partial hepatectomy through the induction of H2-Bl/HLA-G, which is associated with liver regeneration and improved survival rate.\n110\n A notable systematic study summarized current evidence on the cytokine-mediated and growth factor-mediated signaling pathways in liver regeneration for the benefit of clinicians and discussed their suitability for individual mediator-based regeneration predictions in patients. The study reported that the GH–IGF1–IGF1R axis is necessary for liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in liver-specific IGFIR knockout mice.\n103\n Besides, GH therapy has been shown to improve liver regeneration and protein synthesis after hepatectomy in patients with cirrhosis and HCC (NCT03420144 and NCT05253287).",
        "Leptin is mainly produced by adipose tissue and small intestine enterocytes, and it is a hormone that regulates liver functions, including glucose and lipid metabolism, and plays a protective role against fat accumulation and steatosis.111–113 Several studies have investigated its role in liver regeneration.\n114\n Many receptors are associated with leptin functions, including LEPR-a, LEPR-b, LEPR-c, LEPR-d, LEPR-e, and LEPR-f.\n115\n However, LEPR-b has a more prominent role in transducing different signals to the hepatic cells, including JAK-2/STAT3, IRS/PI3K, and SHP-2/MAPK.\n116\n In addition, a lack of leptin can decrease the EGFR and indirectly induce liver regeneration.\n117\n Leptin-deficient mice had impaired liver regeneration post-hepatectomy or toxin damage compared to the control groups.\n118\n Furthermore, lack of leptin can affect DNA synthesis, inhibit mitosis, and change the hepatocyte phenotype to a non-proliferative state.\n119",
        "It was revealed that TNF-α has protective effects during liver regeneration.\n120\n This factor is produced by macrophages and acts via 2 main receptors: TNFR-1 and TNFR-2.\n121\n In normal conditions, TNF-α induces hepatocyte apoptosis and liver failure. However, there are paradoxical reports about the TNF-α, and it seems that its effects on the liver depend on NF­κB activation.\n122\n Indeed, if the expression of TNF-α is associated with NF­κB activation, this will result in DNA synthesis and hepatocyte proliferation.\n123\n Same as EGF and HGF, TNF-α expression is associated with Akt phosphorylation, and TNF has a promoting role in the mitogenic effect of EGF and HGF.\n124\n Furthermore, the lack of TNF-α expression is associated with lower levels of IL-6,\n125\n which is critical for activating STAT3.\n126\n Seemingly, TNF-α is involved in the early stages of liver regeneration; complete knockout of TNF-α did not delay regeneration, suggesting that TNF-α is not involved in the later stages of regeneration.\n103\n On the other hand, another study investigated the effects of pentoxifylline on liver regeneration in 101 patients undergoing major liver resection. The study found that pentoxifylline improved liver regeneration through downregulation of TNF-α synthesis and TGFB1 expression.\n127",
        "IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that is highly expressed at the cell surface of hepatocytes, plays a role in different pathophysiological states,\n128\n and triggers intracellular signaling pathways through its receptor (IL-6R).\n129\n IL-6 is a potent hepatocyte mitogen, and the levels of IL-6 rapidly increase after hepatectomy, alongside the upregulation of TNF-α in the liver’s central vein.\n130\n It was reported that IL-6 knockout mice have impaired liver regeneration,\n131\n while elevated expression of IL-6 or its receptor promotes liver regeneration and hepatocyte proliferation. Although IL-6 acts as a double-edged sword, prolonged activation of the IL-6 signaling pathway during chronic liver diseases damages the liver and could ultimately result in liver carcinogenesis, as in HCC patients, elevated serum levels of IL-6 and the soluble IL-6R have been detected.\n132",
        "During the final phase of liver regeneration, certain mitogens terminate the rapid proliferation of hepatocytes to avoid overgrowth and provide an adequate mass for compensation. This stage, known as the termination phase, is marked by the transition of actively proliferative hepatocytes to a differentiated and functional state once the regeneration process is complete.\n133\n The precise regulation of terminator mitogens is the key difference between physiological and pathological liver regeneration. Disturbance in terminating mitogens can lead to pathological conditions in 2 ways: the lack of these signaling molecules can lead to excessive uncontrolled mitosis and development of pathologic regenerative nodules, or their long-term expression may result in chronic inflammatory conditions and fibrosis.\n134",
        "Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) is the most essential hepatocyte proliferation inhibitor, which terminates cell proliferation during hepatic regeneration. It is primarily secreted by non-parenchymal cells, including HSCs, KCs, and platelets. This factor is produced by proliferating hepatocytes. Four hours following partial hepatectomy, the expression of TGF-β1 in regenerating hepatocytes increases and peaks at 72 hours.\n135\n However, during liver regeneration, the responsiveness to TGF-β1 decreases temporarily, which is essential for proceeding with hepatocyte proliferation. This transient resistance may occur due to the downregulation of TGF-β1 receptors or the formation of co-regulatory axes like SnoN–Smad2/3 and YAP-1–Smad2 complexes.\n136\n Based on the literature, there are several mechanisms through which TGF-β1 can inhibit hepatocyte proliferation, and these multifaceted approaches enable TGF-β1 to play a central role in regulating liver regeneration. TGF-β1 hinders the secretion of HGF, the main regenerative mitogen after partial hepatectomy, and inhibits DNA synthesis induced by HGF, EGF, HB-EGF, and TNF-α in cultured hepatocytes. Another mechanism in this regard is TGF-β‘s regulation of the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. Reduced TGF-β/SMAD signaling accelerates hepatocyte proliferation.\n137\n The activation of TGF-β is necessary for inhibiting cell proliferation, and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is required for TGF-β activation. Mice with TSP-1 deficiency following partial hepatectomy showed significantly reduced TGF-β/Smad signaling and accelerated hepatocyte proliferation. TSP-1 is prominently produced in liver endothelial cells in response to partial hepatectomy, and thereafter, TGF-β signaling is inhibited in the early regeneration period by upregulation of TGF-β inhibitory proteins SnoN and Ski and a downregulation of SMAD2 and SMAD4 levels, which are significantly enhanced following partial hepatectomy. These findings suggest that TSP-1 plays a crucial role in liver regeneration by regulating TGF-β signaling.138,139",
        "Activins, as a member of the TGF-β superfamily, play an influential role in terminating liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy. Activin A level increases 12 hours after partial hepatectomy and is considered an apoptogen that induces hepatocyte growth arrest in vitro and in vivo. Like TGF-β, activin A signaling is reduced during liver regeneration because its cellular receptor levels are downregulated. However, receptor levels are restored once liver regeneration is completed.\n30\n Treatment of mice lacking the type II TGF-β receptor with follistatin, an activin A antagonist, enhanced DNA synthesis and prolonged hepatocyte proliferation. Activin A also significantly affects the production of fibronectin, an essential component of the ECM required for liver regeneration. On the other hand, chronic liver injury leads to the long-term activation of autocrine TGF-β and activin A signaling, contributing to the constant status of partial epithelial–mesenchymal transition in hepatic progenitor cells. Furthermore, in hepatocytes, TGF-β and activin A signaling are key players in liver fibrosis by inducing autonomous synthesis of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2). This partial epithelial–mesenchymal transition state and excessive ECM production may facilitate liver fibrosis, promoting the hepatic progenitor cells to participate in hepatocarcinogenesis.140,141",
        "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are the other members of the TGF-β superfamily, but the signaling pathway mediated by BMPs is relatively complex. Different subunits of BMPs exhibit different or even controversial effects on hepatocyte proliferation. It seems that BMP-4 and BMP-9 inhibit the proliferation of hepatocytes; however, BMP-7 promotes hepatocyte proliferation.\n142\n It has been found that BMP-4 is mainly expressed in the peribiliary stroma and endothelial cells of the liver, and its expression is decreased after hepatectomy. BMP-4 also contributes to hepatoblast differentiation in vivo through the BMP4/Smad1 axis.142,143 BMP-9 is constitutively expressed in healthy liver, predominantly by quiescent and activated HSCs. It was shown that treatment with BMP-9 inhibited proliferation and epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and induced the expression of hepatic maturity genes in cultured hepatocytes. Furthermore, BMP-9 mRNA expression was temporarily decreased after acute liver injury induced by partial hepatectomy or single injections of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or lipopolysaccharides in mouse models.\n144\n Conversely, BMP-7 facilitates liver regeneration by promoting hepatocyte proliferation and reducing liver damage. Notably, ALK3 (BMP receptor type 1A) is expressed in healthy livers and upregulated in regenerating livers. Interestingly, BMP7 is not expressed in the liver, and circulating BMP7 is released from the kidneys, targeting the liver to promote regeneration and acting as a pro-regenerative endogenous hormone.\n145\n Moreover, there are controversial findings concerning the role of BMP-2 in liver regeneration. Some studies suggested that its expression rapidly declines after partial hepatectomy, implying that BMP-2 signaling does not support hepatocyte proliferation during the regenerative process.\n142\n However, others indicated that BMP-2 restoration might assist in recovery from liver fibrosis by attenuating TGF-β1 signaling.\n146\n These findings point out that BMP-2 plays a complex role in liver regeneration, contributing to the wound-healing process and liver fibrosis regression, while this signaling may not directly support hepatocyte proliferation during the regenerative phase.",
        "Considering these controversial findings, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of BMPs in the progression of liver disease is critically important for improving their therapeutic effect.",
        "Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy involves a complex network of signaling pathways that are controlled by mitogenic growth factors, cytokines, hormones, and transcription factors. The events during liver regeneration are finely tuned in time and space, and the interplay between these signaling pathways is critical for liver regeneration. However, the exact mechanisms of how these signaling pathways interact with each other have not been fully understood yet.",
        "Wnts are glycoproteins that induce different intracellular signaling pathways in mammals.\n147\n Wnt ligands induce their frizzled receptors via 2 major pathways: (1) the “canonical pathway,” which is related to β-catenin regulation and is called the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. (2) The “non-canonical pathway,” which is called Wnt/Ca2+ or Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway.\n148\n The Wnt/β-catenin pathway induces proliferation and improves survival rate, which is known for its function in liver regeneration.\n149\n When this pathway is inactivated, the level of β-catenin is low due to its phosphorylation and degradation by the destruction complex, including Axin, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and casein kinase-1α (CK1-α).\n150\n This complex is responsible for the β-catenin phosphorylation, ubiquitin targeting, and proteasomal degradation. Wnt/β-catenin activation causes the arrangement of scaffold protein disheveled (DVL), which leads to disaggregation of the destruction complex and the stabilization of β-catenin. Stabilized β-catenin molecules accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus.\n151\n Furthermore, β-catenin can be phosphorylated by EGFR and MET, resulting in the prevention of destruction complex formation and facilitating its translocation.\n152\n The Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a vital role in liver regeneration, liver function, and hepatic tumor development.\n153\n In rat models, after 70% partial hepatectomy, overexpressed Wnt1 and nuclear β-catenin are mainly increased in remaining hepatocytes. Usually, a transient increase of β-catenin occurs within 5 minutes after hepatectomy,\n154\n associated with cyclinD1 and c-myc overexpression, and results in cellular proliferation.\n155\n Moreover, this pathway has crosstalk with MET and EGFR, related to HGF and EGFR ligand stimulation, and enhances complete mitogen functions.\n156\n In fact, it was shown that β-catenin knockdown mice had low rates of hepatocyte proliferation and delayed liver regeneration.157,158",
        "The hedgehog family regulates cell fate, including proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation.\n159\n This pathway comprises signaling molecules, including Sonic (Shh), Indian (Ihh), and Desert (Dhh) Hedgehog.\n160\n The principles of the Hedgehog pathway occur in primary cilia (PC), which form from centrioles at the end of the mitosis receptor.\n161\n In addition, 4 components, including Patched (Ptch) receptor, signal transducer Smoothened (Smo), Glioblastoma (Gli) family, and Hedgehog ligands, regulate the Hedgehog pathway.\n162\n In the absence of hedgehog ligands, Ptch inhibits the activity of Smo, which is associated with Gli phosphorylation and degradation.\n163\n However, in the context of Hedgehog ligands, adhesion to Ptch and Smo activation prevents Gli degradation, which is associated with its nuclear transcription.\n164\n Hedgehog ligands are produced during liver regeneration, stimulated by factors such as EGF, TGF-β, and PDGF.\n165\n Injured hepatic cells produce Sonic Hedgehog and Indian Hedgehog ligands,\n166\n dramatically increasing Hedgehog signaling after partial hepatectomy. This was associated with epithelial regeneration, Hippo/Yes-associated protein 1 (Yap-1) activation, and sinusoidal cell regeneration, resulting in liver regeneration.\n152",
        "The hippo signaling pathway coordinates cell proliferation during physiologic organ growth.\n167\n This pathway acts through the Mammalian Ste20-like kinases (MST1/2) and large tumor suppressor kinase (LATS1/2), resulting in the inhibition of yes-associated protein (YAP) and Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ).\n168\n Hippo signaling seems to regulate hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration through YAP/TAZ blockage, resulting in regeneration halts.\n169\n It was also suggested that liver regeneration and cell plasticity are severely impaired after YAP/TAZ blockage.\n170\n However, YAP/TAZ is not necessary for liver regeneration due to the essential roles of complete mitogens.\n171",
        "The liver has a remarkable ability to regenerate following injury, particularly through 2 primary pathways of liver regeneration: the proliferation of mature hepatocytes and the activation of liver progenitor/stem cells (LPCs).172,173 The proliferation of mature hepatocytes is primarily driven by mitogenic signals from certain growth factors, including HGF and EGF. These growth factors activate specific signaling pathways essential for cell division and regeneration.\n174\n LPCs possess the capability to differentiate into both hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, thereby offering an alternative mechanism for tissue repair in the context of chronic injury.\n175\n Recent studies have elucidated the interactions between regenerative and accelerator mitogens, revealing how these pathways coordinate to promote liver regeneration. For instance, BAs have been shown to modulate these pathways, enhancing the regenerative response.\n176\n Furthermore, advances in genetic engineering have led to the development of mouse models with specific gene knockouts or modifications. The lack of EGFR signaling in knockout mice resulted in increased mortality rates and elevated serum transaminase levels, indicating severe liver injury. The studies found that the reduced expression of cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin D1 and cdk2, leads to delayed cell cycle progression and decreased hepatocyte proliferation, emphasizing the substantial role of EGFR ligands (such as EGF, TGF-α, HB-EGF, and amphiregulin) in promoting liver regeneration after injury.\n177\n Mouse models lacking key hedgehog signaling pathway components provided insights into the role of this pathway in regulating the balance between hepatocyte proliferation and LPC activation.\n178\n Genetic modifications targeting BA receptors, such as FXR, showed that BAs are a crucial accelerator of mitogens in liver regeneration. Studies involving mice with disrupted BA signaling pathways demonstrated delayed liver regeneration following hepatectomy, indicating the importance of BAs in modulating mitogen activity and promoting hepatocyte proliferation.\n179\n A study on the TGF-α knockout mouse model indicated that liver regeneration proceeded normally after a 70% hepatectomy in mice, indicating that TGF-α is not essential for liver regeneration but could be important in the progression of tumors.\n180\n Conversely, mouse models with overexpression of TGF-α have provided insights into its role in promoting liver regeneration. The enhanced regenerative response was associated with elevated activation of EGFR and subsequent downstream signaling pathways that promote cell division.\n181\n These models have provided insights into how alterations in mitogen signalings can affect liver regeneration outcomes, enabling the exploration of potential therapeutic targets.",
        "Liver zonation describes the organized arrangement of hepatocytes and other liver cells within the hepatic lobule, which is divided into 3 distinct zones: periportal (zone 1), midzonal (zone 2), and pericentral (zone 3). Each zone has unique metabolic functions and responds differently to a range of stimuli, including injury and regeneration. Hepatocytes initiate the cell cycle during the regeneration process, enabling them to proliferate and repair damaged tissue. The expression of zone-specific genes plays a crucial role in facilitating the functional recovery of various metabolic regions.\n182\n IGF2 is a significant zonal signal produced by pericentral hepatocytes located in zone 3 during liver regeneration. This growth factor facilitates hepatocyte proliferation and contributes to the repair of tissue following liver injury, highlighting its essential function in the regenerative process.\n104\n Following liver injury, different zones activate distinct signaling pathways that influence regeneration. For instance, hepatocytes in zone 1 may respond more robustly to growth factors like HGF due to their proximity to the portal triad, where these factors are abundant.\n183\n The distribution pattern of growth factors and cytokines within the liver tissue also reflects zonation. Notably, the concentration of HGF may be higher in periportal regions (zone 1), facilitating the rapid proliferation of hepatocytes in that region. Similarly, the signaling of TGF-α may differ across the zones, thereby influencing the regenerative responses of hepatocytes.\n184\n The expression of IGF2 in zone 3 underscores the spatial regulation of growth factors that modulate regenerative responses throughout the liver lobule.",
        "The liver has an exceptional ability to regenerate after the loss of liver tissue due to drug and chemical-induced injury, surgical resection, infection, or trauma.\n185\n This regenerative capacity is a well-documented compensatory mechanism.\n186\n The administration of a single dose of CCl4 in mice induces the degeneration of hepatic architecture and subsequent liver necrosis. Notably, hepatocellular proliferation along with sinusoidal remodeling around necrosis initiates within 24 hours, peaks at 48 hours, and concludes by 72 hours, as reported by Michalopoulos and DeFrances.\n187\n This observation underscores the liver’s inherent compensatory regeneration potential following acute chemically-induced liver injury, which is often reversible up to a certain extent. In a study, mice treated with 300 mg of acetaminophen exhibited significant liver injury followed by robust regeneration. However, when the acetaminophen dose was increased to 600 mg, liver regeneration was inhibited, resulting in sustained liver injury, reduced survival rate, cell cycle arrest, and decreased expression of cyclin D1.\n188\n This highlights that when a threshold of injury is exceeded, liver regeneration could be inhibited.\n188\n Therefore, the extent of liver regeneration is crucial in determining the final outcome of toxicant-induced liver injury.\n188\n Timely stimulation of liver regeneration can also enhance the liver’s regenerative potential and improve survival. Conversely, inhibiting liver regeneration, such as with colchicine, an antimitotic agent, exacerbates injury and can lead to death.\n186\n Mechanistically, in acute liver injury, free radicals generated by the metabolites of drugs or chemicals damage hepatocytes, leading to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns that induce inflammation and activate non-parenchymal cells, thereby initiating the regeneration process. Following acute liver injury, activated resident inflammatory cells, including KCs, and nonresident inflammatory cells from the bone marrow, are recruited to the damaged area to support regeneration. For example, activated KCs secrete IL-6, which facilitates the expression of several genes related to acute-phase proteins, cell-cycle regulation, redox balance, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms, thereby promoting the proliferation of remnant hepatocytes.189–191 Similarly, non-parenchymal cells such as HSCs and LSECs contribute to liver regeneration by inducing hepatocyte proliferation and sinusoidal remodeling through mutual signaling loops.\n192\n LSECs are also activated by acute inflammation and produce HGF and Wnt2 to initiate liver regeneration. Following an acute injury, the increase in CXCR7 expression in LSECs works together with CXCR4 to activate the transcription factor Id1. This process releases pro-regenerative angiocrine factors and initiates regeneration.\n193\n HSCs are transiently activated due to immune responses and adhere to hepatocytes during the initial stage of liver regeneration in rats,\n194\n and increased ECM production will lead to an acceleration of the regeneration process. The activated HSCs secrete HGF, to initiate the liver regeneration while ECM acts as a scaffold for the proliferation of hepatocytes, provides mechanical stability in the damaged area, and helps to restore the architecture of the injured tissue.\n34",
        "Chronic exposure to hepatotoxic agents, including xenobiotics, viral infections, and medications, leads to chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling, activation of HSCs, and stimulation of fibrogenesis, causing an imbalance between ECM synthesis and biodegradation.\n195\n In chronic liver inflammation, the loss of hepatocytes continues alongside their proliferation.\n191\n Long-term proliferation of hepatocytes is associated with fibrosis and HSCs activation, resulting in nodular hyperplasia\n196\n and potentially HCC.\n197\n Indeed, the morphology of the liver would change during this pathological regeneration, manifesting as nodularity and shrinkage of the hepatic tissue, which is different from physiological liver regeneration, characterized by compensatory hyperplasia and without any nodularity\n198\n (Figure 2). Besides, damaged hepatocytes and activated HSCs release different cytokines and chemokines, which attract immune cells (chemotaxis) of liver tissue and infiltration of peripheral blood immune cells into the injury site.",
        "Different conditions that cause liver injury lead to different consequences in liver regeneration.",
        "Liver regeneration following chronic injury is a complex process that involves several cell types within the liver. Specifically, LPCs, cholangiocytes, and HSCs are considered key contributors to hepatocyte formation during regeneration. These cells interact with resident immune cells in various ways to facilitate the regenerative process.\n199\n Studies have demonstrated the role of different cell lineages in the liver, which offer avenues to drive liver regeneration. For example, SOX9+ hepatocytes are considered bipotent progenitors, serving as the primary source of both hepatocytes and ductal cells during the regeneration process following CCl4-induced liver injury.\n200\n Recently Peng et al\n201\n reported a rare Gli1+ (glioma-associated oncogene 1)/epithelial cell adhesion molecule positive progenitor cell population characterized by both epithelial and mesenchymal identities contributing to liver repair and liver regeneration during chronic injury. Forkhead box protein A3 (FOXA3), a transcription factor, has been predominantly expressed in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes during the regeneration after PH and CCl4-induced liver injury in mice. FOXA3 ablation in mice caused exacerbation of CCl4-induced liver injury and delay in the regeneration process.\n202\n This study further suggests that FOXA3 promotes liver regeneration by regulating the transcription of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (Cebpb). It has also been revealed that the levels of Cebpb and Ki67 were positively correlated with Foxa3 expression in livers in patients with chronic liver diseases.\n202",
        "From the HSC perspective, during chemically-induced chronic liver injury, myofibroblasts produce excessive fibrous scar tissue, leading to hepatic fibrosis. Experimental studies have shown that when the underlying etiological agent is removed, liver regeneration begins, and the fibrosis remarkably regresses with the disappearance of myofibroblasts. A significant population of myofibroblasts undergoes apoptosis. Kisseleva et al\n203\n demonstrated that approximately half of the myofibroblasts evade apoptosis and transform into a new phenotype, termed “inactive hepatic stellate cells,” which is similar to but distinct from the original quiescent HSCs during the recovery phase after CCl4 and ethanol intoxication. These inactive hepatic stellate cells exhibit decreased expression of fibrogenic genes such as collagen-α1(I), collagen-α1(II), α-SMA, TGFβRI, and TIMP1, while upregulating certain quiescence-associated genes (PPARγ and Bambi) to levels comparable to quiescent HSCs. The inactivation of HSCs has been implicated in the upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes, including Heat Shock Protein Family A 1a/b, which contribute to the survival of HSCs both in vitro and in vivo. HSCs have been recognized as a potential source of LPCs and may contribute to the formation of hepatocytes in the adult liver.204,205",
        "SRY-related HMG box transcription factor 9+ LPCs have also been suggested to be responsible for one of the main sources of hepatocyte turnover in CCl4-intoxicated mice.\n206\n LPCs act as regulatory or “dimmer switch” cells during chronic liver injury and regeneration. LPCs are usually dormant in the periportal region in the healthy liver; however, after chronic liver injury, they actively proliferate and yield transit-amplifying cells (or oval cells) called the ductular reaction (DR) in humans or oval cell proliferation in rodents.207–209 LPCs are significantly contributing to liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy or CCl4-induced liver injury.\n206\n Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) has been shown to play a critical role in the crosstalk between HSCs and LPCs during liver regeneration. Low levels of GDF11 have been associated with enhanced pro-fibrogenic factors, which activate HSCs to become fibrogenic and induce fibrosis via LPCs. During regeneration following chronic liver injury, the perisinusoidal microenvironment becomes less fibrogenic, with elevated levels of GDF11 promoting the expansion of LPCs and the recruitment of scar-resolving immune subsets.\n210\n Large number of LPCs and biliary cell-derived yellow fluorescent protein+/hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α+ hepatocytes have been reported during regeneration after CCl4-induced liver injury in mice. The presence of such cells is correlated with the lower density of ECM, laminin, and/or other CTGF-dependent profibrotic signals that stimulate hepatocyte differentiation.\n209\n Further, coculturing LPCs with activated HSCs isolated from mice intoxicated with thioacetamide for 6 weeks has been reported to reduce the fibrogenic potential of these HSCs within the fibrotic niche.\n211\n Yap protein becomes activated in response to hepatocyte damage caused by ethanol and CCl4. Once activated, Yap forms complexes with TEAD transcription factors in the nucleus, driving transcriptional reprogramming that promotes hepatocyte proliferation and activation of progenitor cells.\n212\n Based on experimental findings, Qian and colleagues have proposed a mechanism of activation, expansion, and differentiation of liver progenitor-like cells into hepatocytes during liver regeneration. After chronic liver injuries, dying hepatocytes express hedgehog ligands, which are shown to directly induce liver progenitor-like cells mediated regeneration and indirectly induce their proliliferation by activating HSCs into ECM producing phenotype.\n213\n The lymphotoxin β receptor on HSCs, activated through the HIPPO/YAP pathway, could play a role in paracrine communication with neighboring LTβ-expressing liver progenitor-like cells. After activation, TWEAK, probably from recruited macrophage,\n214\n exerts a selective mitogenic effect on liver progenitor-like cells by promoting their proliferation through its receptor, FGF-inducible 14.\n215\n FGF-7 is involved in the proliferation of liver progenitor-like cells, while FGF-9 plays a role in the differentiation of progenitor-like cells into hepatocytes. Hepatic growth factor/c-met signaling,\n216\n Wnt/β-catenin signaling,\n217\n and thyroid hormone signaling\n218\n have been found to be implicated in the differentiation of progenitor-like cells into mature hepatocytes.",
        "Cholangiocytes transdifferentiate into hepatocytes through the mechanism of DR, which occurs in chronic liver injury. There is enough evidence suggesting that chronic liver injury causes DR-cells to differentiate into stress-resistant hepatocytes that replenish the liver. This process may be the cause of parenchymal rebuilding found in the livers of individuals with advanced-stage hepatitis.\n219\n Actually, long-lasting liver injury is linked to an extensive DR and a decline in native hepatocyte regenerative capacity at a time-dependent level.\n220",
        "Interestingly, Wnt/β catenin and Notch signaling play pivotal roles during liver regeneration. In fact, these pathways coordinate the biliary epithelial cell (BEC)–transitional liver progenitor cell (TLPC) hepatocyte transdifferentiating process. These findings indicate that Notch signaling inhibitors can enhance BEC to TLPC conversion. Moreover, Wnt/β catenin activation increases TLPC to hepatocyte conversion. Such mechanistic evidence may offer a potential therapeutic target for chronic liver injuries.\n221",
        "Macrophages and NK cells play pivotal roles in liver regeneration. During liver regeneration, LPCs induce the recruitment of infiltrating macrophages to the injured liver through the CCL2/CCR2 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1 chemokine axes.\n213\n Anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages promote tissue repair.\n222\n Macrophages influence NK cells through the secretion of cytokines and complex cellular interactions. NK cells are also involved in LPC proliferation and MSC migration and recruitment towards immune cell populations via the secretion of CXCL7, thereby promoting regeneration.\n223\n Innate immune cells, like monocytes, are also critically involved in liver regeneration. Classical monocytes express high levels of Ly6c, which are reportedly associated with promoting liver injury. Non-classical Ly-6Clow monocytes have been shown to be involved in tissue repair, inflammation resolution, and regeneration.\n224\n Following mild liver injury, there is a phenotypic switch from classical to non-classical monocytes to accelerate tissue repair. However, during progressive liver injury, persistent inflammation leads to a failure in this phenotypic switch, impairing the repair process.\n225\n Monocyte-derived CD11b+ macrophages, which are known to activate HSCs and promote fibrosis, are increased during thioacetamide-induced chronic liver injury.\n226\n However, their population decreases during fibrosis resolution, contributing to a less fibrotic environment after thioacetamide-induced chronic liver injury.\n211\n Similarly, in a CCl4-induced regeneration in mice, activation of D prostanoid receptor-1 enhanced Wnt2 transcription in resident KCs via a protein kinase A/CRE-binding protein-dependent pathway and facilitated hepatocyte proliferation through Frizzled8/β-catenin signaling,\n227\n suggesting the crosstalk between KCs and hepatocytes through Wnt2 signaling during liver regeneration after chronic liver injury.",
        "Altogether, liver regeneration after chronic liver injury is a multifaceted complex process that involves various cells, all interacting through many intricate signaling pathways. This complexity is further compounded by other factors such as the nature and the extent of the injury. All This makes the understanding of liver regeneration post chronic liver injury very challenging.",
        "Several cytokines are responsible for the pathological regeneration of the liver, including TGF-β, which promotes the deposition of type I and III collagens in ECM,228,229 IL-1 β and TNF-α, which support the survival of HSCs,\n230\n and IL-33, which indirectly activates HSCs through the STAT-6 pathway.\n231\n Moreover, immune cells unintentionally play a determining role in the pathogenesis of liver regeneration. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and HSCs have a mutual crosstalk in an IL-2-dependent pattern. HSCs specifically stimulate Tregs, while Tregs have an opposite effect on HSCs; Tregs protect HSCs from natural killer (NK) cells' attack, and also have an inhibitory effect on activated HSCs.\n232\n Activated NK cells release interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) through the JAK–STAT pathway to tackle hepatic fibrosis by destroying the activated HSCs. However, with sustained HSC activation during chronic liver injury, HSCs suppress NK cell activity and reduce their anti-fibrotic action. This is related to the increased metabolism of vitamin A, which produces retinoic acid and retinol metabolites that inhibit the activation of IFN-γ through the STAT-1 pathway by secreting suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1).\n233\n Additionally, normal hepatocytes are heterogeneous in ploidy level, from 2n to 8n, which is a characteristic factor for liver homeostasis.\n234\n After physiological/normal liver regeneration, the ploidy would be stored in hepatocytes; however, in chronic liver injuries, the ploidy level can be decreased.\n235\n DNA damage might occur in both normal and during acute injury, which can be compensated by polyploidy and excessive expression of damaged alleles. However, in chronic liver injury, chromosome abnormality, especially in growth control genes (eg, EGF), can initiate neoplasia\n236\n (Figure 1).",
        "Another concept in pathological liver regeneration is associated with the role of hepatic resident stem cells. In chronic liver injury, the capacity of hepatocytes to maintain liver hemostasis may not be sufficient; therefore, a complementary mechanism could be activated to accelerate liver regeneration. In this regard, small bipotential resident stem cells, known as LPCs in humans or oval cells in rodents, could be activated to support the regeneration process.\n237\n LPCs can differentiate into hepatocytes and biliary cells and, accordingly, play a crucial role in liver repair during constant hepatic or biliary damages such as viral hepatitis or biliary cirrhosis.\n238\n However, the activation of LPCs may be associated with myofibroblasts activation, an alarming sight of liver regeneration in chronic damage settings.\n239\n This issue is related to the microenvironment of LPCs, which contains ECM, growth factors, and cytokines.\n240\n CTGF, a member of LPCs’ niche, releases heparin-binding proteins (HBP) and plays an essential role in liver fibrosis.\n241\n CTGF, whose levels are increased in chronic liver damage, will exacerbate fibrogenesis by activating HSCs.\n242",
        "MKK4 is essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, as it modulates the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways.\n243\n Recent studies have focused on its inhibitors as potential therapeutics for liver diseases and cancer. Development of HRX215, a small molecule inhibitor of MKK4 kinase, has shown significant potential in promoting liver regeneration and preventing liver failure in preclinical studies.\n244\n This small molecule was well-tolerated at all doses, with no significant changes in clinical or laboratory parameters. Notably, HRX215 reduced tumor progression in a diet-induced obese mouse model with NASH and advanced fibrosis.245,246 A phase I clinical trial showed favorable safety and pharmacokinetic properties for HRX215, supporting its further clinical investigation.\n245",
        "Liver regeneration is an intricate process, implying various molecular and cellular mechanisms. At first glance, it may seem that the same mitogens are involved in promoting both normal and pathological liver regeneration. However, the most important difference between these 2 pathways, which lead to different fates, is the start time, duration, and different concentrations of regenerative, accelerator, and terminator mitogens (Figure 3). In contrast to pathological liver regeneration, which occurs after chronic liver damages, physiological liver regeneration typically takes place after acute injuries or liver resection. Pathological liver regeneration typically results in nodularity and shrinkage, whereas physiological liver regeneration is associated with liver enlargement. Comprehending both the positive and potentially negative outcomes of regeneration mechanisms holds the potential to unlock novel therapeutic opportunities. The knowledge accumulated over the past few decades, particularly through examining liver regeneration in rodents, is expected to facilitate this attempt significantly. The ultimate goal of this area of research is to harness the profound understanding of hepatocellular plasticity and renewal, and translate it into the development of targeted therapeutics for a broad spectrum of human liver diseases. By comprehending the intricate mechanisms underlying the ability of liver cells to adapt and regenerate, researchers aim to identify novel therapeutic approaches that can effectively address conditions such as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and even liver cancer. By leveraging this knowledge, we envision the development of tailored treatments that can promote liver regeneration, inhibit disease progression, and restore normal liver function. These efforts strive to offer hope and improved outcomes for patients facing liver diseases by unraveling the potential of hepatocellular plasticity as a therapeutic avenue and driving innovation in the field of liver medicine.",
        "Alterations in mitogen levels lead to different outcomes. The start point, duration, and concentrations of mitogens are the main determinators of the liver regeneration’s fate.",

        "Yang et al. find that the histone modification H3K27me3 accumulates in many tissues with age, due to increased time in quiescence. H3K27me3 is gained over lamin-associated domains but reduced at developmental gene promoters with consequent changes in global and local transcription. Liver regeneration breaks quiescence and partially restores youthful patterns.",
        "The epigenome is responsible for connecting the genetic information in our chromosomes to functional outcomes; i.e., it links the genotype with the phenotype.1 Age-related epigenomic changes drive organ dysfunction through increased inflammation, fibrosis, reduced regeneration, and incidence of disease.2–5 Given the reversible nature of epigenomic changes, they are attractive therapeutic targets.",
        "Aside from DNA methylation, age-related chromatin mechanisms have been investigated limitedly, assayed primarily in model organisms or cellular models.2 Consequently, this has restricted our understanding of cellular aging in quiescent mammalian tissues. Quiescence refers to a reversible G0 state of differentiated cells required to achieve and maintain optimal organ mass, geometry, and homeostatic function. Quiescent cells do not allocate resources to cell division or growth but remain metabolically active and responsive to environmental stresses.6 Aged tissue thus contains cells that have remained quiescent for prolonged periods but whether prolonged quiescence (a state we call hyper-quiescence) incurs temporal epigenomic alterations and impacts organ function is unknown. Alternatively, aged tissues also accumulate senescent cells7 distinctly from classic quiescence. Senescent cells in most tissues are rare and organ dysfunction is evident prior to detection of senescent cells, suggesting that prolonged quiescence may dominate age-associated functional decline.",
        "One chromatin mechanism that has been implicated but not investigated deeply in quiescence and aging is lysine trimethylation on histone H3 (H3K27me38). H3K27me3 induces compaction and gene silencing. This repressive modification is deposited by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which assembles with one of two paralogous catalytic subunits: enhancer of zeste homolog 1 (EZH1) or EZH2 to form canonical and non-canonical complexes.9–11 PRC2, along with PRC1, represses key developmental gene promoters required to establish a specific cell lineage. Unlike most repressors, PRC2 is not recruited to these sites by any transcription factor (TF) but rather by the unique chromatin environment. Interestingly, transcription itself can evict PRC2, suggesting that transcriptionally dormant states (such as prolonged quiescence) can perpetuate modifications such as H3K27me3.10,12",
        "We use the liver as a model organ to investigate chromatin changes in aging given its pivotal role in metabolism and evidence of clear age-related decline. Furthermore, the liver has remarkable regenerative capacity,13 which provides an opportune rejuvenation system to test the reversibility of age-associated chromatin states. Our findings reveal H3K27me3 is a mediator of the aging process and further suggest that regeneration partially mitigates age-related H3K27me3 patterns. Analogous chromatin changes occur in other organs (kidney, heart, and muscle).",
        "We used several chromatin-based assays to evaluate the altered epigenome in the aging liver (Figure 1A). Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) we surveyed the histone post-translational modification (hPTM) landscape in the aging liver (Tables S1 and S2, MS raw data at chorusproject: chorusproject.org/1769). As proof-of-principle, the ratio of variant H3.3 to canonical H3.1/3.2 (hereon H3) was increased in old livers (Figure S1A), consistent with previous reports.14 There was no significant difference in monomethyl (me1), dimethyl (me2), trimethyl (me3) or acetyl (ac)-ated histone abundance with age (Figure S1B). However, quantification of single hPTMs revealed some striking changes with age.",
        "In pairwise comparisons of young and old livers, the repressive hPTMs H3K27me3, H3K18me1, H4K20me2, and a single active mark, H3K18ac, were significantly enriched in old livers (Figure 1B, green circles). We were intrigued by the increase of H3K27me3 in aging, which has been noted (but not always emphasized) in several reports including those in aged Drosophila head and muscle,15 killifish brain,16 killifish muscle,17 aged murine muscle stem cells18,19 and aged human post-mortem brains.20 As examples, we mined the published LC-MS/MS data from murine muscle stem cells and human brains. Much like the murine liver, these tissues showed significant increase in H3K27me3 with age (Figures S1C and S1D). We used orthogonal methods such as western blot (Figure 1C; Table S1), immunofluorescence (IF, Figure S1E; Table S1) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) (Figure S1F, explained in the next section; Table S1) to validate the increase of H3K27me3 in mouse livers. Furthermore, we carefully examined the hepatocyte ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled to immunogold labeling to visualize the spatial location of H3K27me3 in young and old livers (Table S1). Most gold particles were detected in the nucleus (Figures 1D and 1E) with significantly higher numbers in old hepatocytes (Figure 1E). Within the nucleus, there was a clear preference for localization in the nuclear matrix (>200 nm from the nuclear membrane) over nuclear periphery (<200 nm of the nuclear membrane, Figure 1F). Interestingly, the immunogold particles in the old hepatocyte nuclei formed clusters (i.e., 3 or more gold particles in proximity, Figures 1D and 1G), suggesting an interaction between H3K27me3-rich regions in the aged cell.",
        "Given that aging is likely to change cell composition of the liver, we tested the abundance of major cell types in young and old livers (Figures S1K–S1M; Table S1) and wondered whether the global age-related increase of H3K27me3 occurred in all or specific cell types. Using the PhenoImager platform, we imaged liver sections with a 6-panel cocktail: CD31 (endothelial cells), CK19 (cholangiocytes), F4/80 (Kupffer cells), HNFα (hepatocytes), H3K27me3 (histone modification) and DAPI (DNA). We noted a significant increase in Kupffer cells and decrease in hepatocyte numbers (Figure S1L). Importantly, H3K27me3 was increased in every cell type we tested except for Kupffer cells (Figure S1M). Together, our results show that a global increase in H3K27me3 is a common epigenetic signature of aging.",
        "We next performed H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in young and old livers with total H3 and IgG as controls (Table S1; quality control (QC) in Figures S2A and S2B). Two % exogenous human chromatin from HeLa cells was spiked in before immunoprecipitation for quantitative comparisons (ChIP-Rx21). A lower % of human reads were recovered in old H3K27me3 ChIP samples (1.7% in old vs. 2.1% in young), suggesting proportionally higher mouse H3K27me3 in old livers (Figure S1F). In contrast, the recovery of human reads in H3 and input was comparable between the two groups.",
        "A principal-component analysis (PCA) of both genome coverage (Figure S1G) and H3K27me3 peaks (Figure S1H) clearly segregated young and old samples, suggesting distinct genome-enrichment patterns. Interestingly, there were fewer H3K27me3 peaks in the old samples (mean in young 5,211 vs. old 3,354) although the differences were not significant (Figure S1I). Curiously, the peaks identified in old samples were generally broader, had higher tag density and lower peak height (Figure S1J), suggesting a “spreading” of the signal. Differential peak analysis revealed only 2 peaks with higher H3K27me3 enrichment and 1,087 peaks with lower H3K27me3 enrichment in old livers (FDR < 0.05, Figure 1H; Table S3). These differential peaks were annotated primarily to promoters (Figure 1I). Example genome browser views of two annotated peaks and related gene expression change are shown in Figure 1J. These findings however were inconsistent with our LC-MS/MS, IF, TEM, western blot and ChIP-seq spike-in results that showed a global accumulation of H3K27me3 with age.",
        "This inconsistency prompted us to look deeper into H3K27me3 genome distribution patterns. The full extent of H3K27me3 signal was captured in the whole chromosome view. At this scale, old livers showed strong enrichment across multi-megabase sized regions across all chromosomes (chr5 and chr18 shown as examples in Figures S3A–S3E). We call this type of enrichment “age-domains.” Age-domains were found in all 3 old biological samples (Figures S3C and S3E) and were more prominent when we scaled the coverage maps to spike-in reads (Figure 1K). Furthermore, we noted that age-domains occurred over gene-poor regions (note gene density, Figure 1K, bottom). In sum, our ChIP-seq data identified two different chromatin states in young and old based on H3K27me3 genome-enrichment patterns: young (more peaks, less age-domains) and old (less peaks, more age-domains).",
        "To further characterize age-domains (schematic in Figure 2A), we assayed the epigenetic landscape at these sites. We “called” age-domains in old samples with the enriched domain detector (EDD) algorithm, which is proficient in detecting wide genomic enrichments with high sensitivity and robustness against local variations.22 EDD accurately identified age-domains as visualized on the genome browser (Figure 1K, note bars on top). We surveyed multiple hPTMs (H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H2A119ub, H3K36me3) as well as total RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) levels at age-domains by ChIP-seq (Table S1). As expected, age-domains showed strong enrichment of H3K27me3 in old samples (Figure 2B). We further mined lamin B1 ChIP-seq data from Whitton et al.23 to profile lamina-associated domains (LADs) and performed DNA immunoprecipitation with anti-5-methylcytosine (5mC) antibody followed by sequencing (meDIP-seq) to identify regions of methylated DNA enrichment (Table S1). These data revealed age-domains were enriched with lamin B1 in young cells with significant loss with age (Figure 2C), suggesting that these are classic LADs.24 Furthermore, as reported before for LADs, these regions underwent significant loss of H3K9me3 with age25 (Figure 2D). Age-domains were depleted for H2A119ub, H3K36me3, 5mC and RNAPII signal (Figures 2E–2H).",
        "In contrast to age-domains, H3K27me3 peak regions (schematic in Figure 2I) showed low enrichment of lamin B1 which was further reduced with age. H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 showed opposite enrichments (as in age-domains), with the latter gaining modest signal and the former losing signal in old samples. H2A119ub also decreased at peaks similar to H3K27me3, suggesting that these sites undergo PRC1/2 mediated repression in young cells. Peak regions were generally depleted of H3K36me3, 5mC and RNAPII (Figures 2J–2P). The findings at age-domains and peak regions are summarized in Figures 2Q and 2R.",
        "In keeping with age-domains being LADs, we observed they significantly overlapped with partially methylated domains (PMDs) that are sites of frequent DNA methylation loss in cancer genomes, as has been reported previously26 (Figure 2S). In contrast, differential peak regions overlapped more with highly methylated domains (HMDs).",
        "To assess whether the H3K27me3 peaks and age-domains segregate into different fractions of chromatin, we measured the salt solubility of mononucleosomes from these regions by extraction under different salt concentrations (Figure 3A). The extracted DNA was purified and analyzed by sequencing. The final pellet (insoluble chromatin) was dissolved in a solubilization buffer and analyzed in a similar fashion (Table S1; QC in Figure S2C). As reported previously,27 we noted that low salt concentrations (0–250 mM) extracted few histones in the supernatant (Figure 5H) and the associated DNA mapped to active regions of the genome (Figures 3B, inset 1, and S4A, inset 1). In the young samples, the euchromatin eluted in the 150 and 250 mM fractions. Euchromatic regions in the old liver showed relatively lower enrichment (Figures 3B, inset 1, and S4A, inset 1), suggesting a decrease in its proportion with aging. Importantly, the old euchromatin fraction eluted at lower salt concentrations (0, 67.5, and 150 mM salt), suggesting a decondensation of this fraction with aging. H3K27me3 peaks in young that were lost in the old (Figure 1H) were among those that showed chromatin decondensation (Figure 3C). Remarkably, we observed that H3K27me3 age-domains in old livers overlapped almost perfectly with the 350 mM and pellet fraction (Figures 3B, inset 2, 3D, and S4A, inset 2), suggesting that these regions are packed into insoluble heterochromatin.",
        "Additionally, the input samples from salt fractionation experiments afforded us the opportunity to assess nucleosome positions similar to a micrococcal nuclease sequencing (MNase-seq) experiment. Using dynamic analysis of nucleosome position (DANPOS),28 we quantified nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness and did not find any differences at age-domains (Figures 3E and 3F). In contrast, at H3K27me3 differential peak regions, nucleosome occupancy was reduced, concordant with de-repression of these genes, without changes in fuzziness (Figures 3G and 3H).",
        "To physically assess whether differences exist between chromatin structures in young and old livers, we purified chromatin using a very mild MNase digestion protocol followed by extraction from nuclei in buffer containing 67.5 mM NaCl. We analyzed these samples (Table S1) by single-molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM). By very mildly digesting chromatin, only the most accessible (hyper-sensitive) DNA is cut, thereby, preserving the more compacted chromatin arrays. This allowed us to quantify how many distinct chromatin arrays were isolated from young and old liver nuclei under identical conditions (Figures 3I–3K). Qualitatively, chromatin obtained from young livers possessed distinct well-organized clusters. In contrast, chromatin from old livers appeared less coherent, with an overall increase in nucleosome number per field and a “carpet-like” appearance (Figure 3I). This result agrees with the observed increase in solubility of old chromatin at 67.5 mM salt (Figures 3B and 3C). Next, we quantified the number of distinct chromatin arrays (clusters) isolated, as well as the height and Feret’s diameter of these arrays. Despite a trend for larger number of arrays and cluster height in the old livers, these results were not statistically significant (Figure 3L, panels 1 and 2). However, in chromatin obtained from old livers, the Feret’s diameter was broader (Figure 3L, panel 3), showing that arrays from old liver nuclei are larger. To delve deeper into nucleosome-level differences, we next quantified the dimensions of individual nucleosomes (height, diameter, and volume) in arrays obtained from young and old livers. The height of nucleosomes, diameter, and volume were significantly smaller in old livers (Figure 3M, panels 1–3). We further probed the nucleosome repeat length (NRL) of the chromatin arrays. We determined linker lengths by measuring the contour length from the center of one nucleosome to the center of the neighboring nucleosome, as it was not always possible to identify the exact entry and exit location of the DNA strand. Old chromatin fibers had significantly lower NRLs compared to young (Figure 3N). Taken together, these data suggest that in older samples, chromatin arrays are larger and more compact. Individual nucleosomes are also more compacted, possibly reflecting a less accessible state of site exposure and that chromatin arrays from older livers occupy larger areas, suggesting either an increased number of nucleosomes per array and/or a loss in higher order coherence.",
        "We wanted to further probe the functional consequences of H3K27me3 peak loss and age-domain gain in old livers. Interestingly, genes near H3K27me3 peaks that were lost in the old livers were related to development (particularly nervous system and cardiac) and cell differentiation (Figure 4A). Loss of H3K27me3 de-repressed these genes (Figure 4B). In support, the H3K36me3 signal also increased over these genes with age (Figure 4C). Ontology terms associated with neuronal function were also seen in the genes upregulated with age (Figure S5D). Most of the genes that lost H3K27me3 signal with age encode developmental TFs, such as Hox, Ascl1, Sox2, Neurog1, Gata4, etc. (Figure 4D; Table S3), that are known to play important roles in neuronal/cardiac lineage specification. Indeed, expression of only 3 TFs, one of which is Ascl1, can reprogram hepatocytes to neurons29",
        "To assess whether H3K27me3-mediated regulation of developmental genes was conserved in aging human livers, we performed cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag)31 with H3K27me3 antibody on human liver core-needle biopsies (Table S1; QC in Figures S2A and S2B). These human subjects were hospitalized for either cholecystectomy, bariatric procedures, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, and had otherwise normal livers. Given the limited sample amount, we were unable to perform ChIP-seq. Nevertheless, from CUT&Tag data, we identified age-related differential sites in the young (1,117 regions) and old (62 regions) samples (Figure S3F), which was numerically similar to the changes seen in mice. As in mice, genes annotated regions with lower H3K27me3 signal in the old were linked to neuronal and cardiac development (Figure S3G). Of note, we could not visualize age-domains of H3K27me3 in our human samples due to the limitation of CUT&Tag in capturing domain-like enrichments.",
        "However, our peak level analyses in both mice and humans suggest a major loss of H3K27me3-mediated suppression of cell identity genes.",
        "While local loss of H3K27me3 compromises cellular identity, we surmised that broad heterochromatinization may have more global effects such as reduction of chromatin accessibility and global transcription. In concordance, old chromatin was more resistant to MNase digestion compared to young, suggesting the formation of a more condensed structure with age (Figures 4E and 4F). This in turn, likely reduces the genome-wide binding of EZH2 to its target regions as assessed by ChIP-seq (Figure 4G; Table S1). In addition, RNAPII ChIP-seq (Figure 4H; Table S1) showed reduced signal at all annotated TSSs in old samples. To ascertain global transcription levels during aging, we prepared RNA-seq libraries (Table S1, see “_bef” samples) with Exfold External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls.32 ERCC spike-ins allow for comparisons across samples with different global RNA levels. We added mix 1 to young and mix 2 to old samples prior to ribo-depletion and library generation (Figure 4I). The data were normalized to reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) and filtered to remove transcripts < 1 RPKM. The log2RPKM (mix1/mix2) for each ERCC transcript (observed ratio) and the log2 ratio of the known attomolar concentrations of the two mixes (expected ratio) were plotted (Figure 4J). If global transcription is unaffected, the observed ratio (black solid line with gray shaded 95% confidence bands) of mix1/mix2 ERCC transcripts is predicted to mirror the expected ratios (dotted line). Our analysis, however, showed that mix1/mix2 ratios were lower than expected, suggesting a strong genome-wide transcription suppression in old livers. This global transcription suppression was observed for every sex-matched young and old animal we compared (Figure 4K), with males showing stronger suppression than females.",
        "Several reports have suggested an epigenetic switch mechanism operating at developmental gene promoters where loss of H3K27me3 is concomitant with gain of DNA methylation.33,34 Our meDIP-seq data failed to capture any changes at these peak regions (Figure 2O), likely due to the fact that meDIP is biased toward genomic regions with low cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) density.35 Indeed, a significant proportion (422/1,089) of H3K27me3 differential peaks occur at gene promoters with CpG islands (CGI+), while only 53/1,089 occur at CGI-genes. As an alternative, we mined published pan-mammalian bead-based methylation array data (HorvathMammalMethylChip40, ~37K CpGs) from 339 predominantly female genetically diverse C57BL/6J and DBA/2J cross (BXD) mice.30 We overlapped the CpGs from the array data with our 1,089 H3K27me3 peak regions and traced the methylation status of the 511 overlapped CpGs across different ages. The results indicate a progressive increase in methylation over these CpGs (Figure 4L), thus confirming that loss of H3K27me3 at developmental gene promoters is concomitant with an increase in DNA methylation. Complementarily, a recent study shows that many clock CpGs that become hypermethylated with age are PRC2 targets.36",
        "Together, our data show that H3K27me3 redistribution during aging has consequences, including a suggested loss of cell identity, decreased accessibility to genome-cutting enzymes, global transcription suppression, and CpG hypermethylation.",
        "While EZH2 plays a dominant role in H3K27me3-mediated gene repression in actively dividing cells, the paralogous EZH1 is highly expressed in post-mitotic tissue.11 We hypothesized that as tissues spend more time in the post-mitotic stage, i.e., with age, they switch to a more EZH1-dependent mode of repression. To test this, we measured the levels of enzymes affecting H3K27me3 in young and old livers. At the RNA level there was no age-associated change in expression of EZH1/2 or demethylases KDM6A/6B (Figure 5A; Table S1). However, at the protein level, EZH2 levels declined while EZH1 showed increase with age (Figure 5B). Protein levels of KDM6A/6B remained unaltered with age (Figure 5B; Table S1). Of note, KDM6A is encoded by the X chromosome and hence is about half the level in males compared to females. KDM6C was not tested as it is a male-specific inactive paralog. Our results support an EZH2-to-EZH1 switch mechanism in aging.",
        "We reasoned that this switch toward EZH1 occurs due to hyper-quiescence i.e., a state of deep quiescence achieved in aged solid tissues due to prolonged stay in a post-mitotic state. To test this directly, we induced quiescence in Hep-G2 hepatoblastoma cell lines by contact inhibition (Figure 5C). Contact inhibition-induced quiescence best mimics the state of cells in normal tissue homeostasis without nutrient deprivation. We saw an increase in H3K27me3 upon entry into quiescence with concomitant loss of EZH2 and gain of EZH1, a condition that is mimicked in aging (Figure 5B). We thus propose that aged livers are in a hyper-quiescent state with a global gain in EZH1-mediated H3K27me3 and loss of EZH2.",
        "We next wanted to understand the mechanism of H3K27me3 loss at peak regions and gain at age-domains. Epigenetic landscape in silico deletion analysis (LISA) is an algorithm that leverages H3K27ac ChIP-seq, transcription regulator ChIP-seq, imputed binding sites and chromatin accessibility profiles to predict transcriptional regulators of a list of genes.37 LISA analysis of our differential genes predicted that the H3K27me3 peaks at promoters were mostly regulated by EZH2, and other polycomb group proteins (Figure 5D; Table S4). Indeed, EZH2 ChIP-seq in old livers showed reduced binding at differentially regulated H3K27me3 peak regions (Figures 5E and 5F; Table S1; QC in Figures S2A and S2B). Additionally, we performed EZH2 IP followed by mass spectrometry from young and old livers (Figure 5G; Table S2) to determine if the PRC2 composition was altered with age. Concordant with the overall loss of EZH2 expression with age (Figure 5B) and the loss of EZH2 binding at developmental gene promoters (Figures 5E and 5F), peptides from the core catalytic components of PRC2 were significantly lower in old samples. We conclude that local loss of H3K27me3 is in part, mediated by the global loss of EZH2.",
        "Converse to the loss of signal at H3K27me3 peaks, age-domains gain signal. We wondered whether this gain of H3K27me3 signal at age-domains was due to EZH1 which increased in expression during aging (Figure 5B). Given that commercial ChIP-grade antibodies detecting the mouse endogenous EZH1 protein are lacking, we blotted for EZH1/2 in the different salt fractions of chromatin in young and old livers from Figures 3A–3D. As expected, H3K27me3 was detected in the high salt fractions and old livers had stronger signal.",
        "Interestingly, EZH1 was detected in the high salt and pellet fraction in old and to a much lesser extent in young livers. EZH2 was detected mainly in the pellet fraction.",
        "We thus conclude that both EZH1 and EZH2 associate with age-domains, however, since EZH1 is expressed more in aging and detected over several high salt fractions in the old, it is speculated to play a more prominent role.",
        "We wondered whether disrupting hyper-quiescence through liver regeneration can epigenetically and functionally rejuvenate aged livers. Besides, regeneration is hypothesized to reduce H3K27me3 by replication dilution.38",
        "The multi-lobular structure of the rodent liver enables removal of specific lobes (partial hepatectomy [PH]) without necrosis,39 allowing for the study of pure regenerative events unlike chemically induced models of regeneration. We used the 70% PH model40 in young and old mice (Figures S5A–S5C; Table S1) and archived “before” and “after” resection livers; 48, 72, 96, 120, and 240 h post-surgery. The 240 h time point represents fully regenerated livers.",
        "To assay regeneration at the transcriptome level, we analyzed our ribo-depleted bulk RNA-seq libraries. In pairwise comparisons before resection, few mRNAs were differentially regulated between young and old (Figure S5D; Table S5). However, 48 h post-resection, there was strong induction of 379 mRNAs associated with cell division in the young liver (Figure 6A, left; Table S5). Congruently, LISA identified E2F factors, known to regulate cell cycle entry into S-phase on the top 341 (Table S4). The 177 mRNAs that were upregulated in the old livers 48 h after surgery instead were related to cell adhesion, inflammation, and response to glucose and insulin (Figure 6A, right) but unrelated to cell proliferation. In contrast, at the later 96 h time point, 199 mRNAs were upregulated in the old livers and were associated with cell division (Figure 6B, right). Sixty of the 199 mRNAs overlapped with the set of 379 mRNAs upregulated at 48 h in young livers (p value = 1.04e–65, representation factor 23.9; hypergeometric test). Contrary to the robust response noted in young livers at 48 h, the response in old livers at 96 h was modest with higher p values and lower gene counts. Additionally, unlike the narrow time window of response in the young (48 h), the proliferative response in old livers spread over 96–120 h post-resection (Figures 6B and S5E). The top candidate factor in LISA analysis for mRNAs upregulated at 96 h (Table S4) and 120 h (Table S4) in the old was also an E2F factor, E2F4. The 80 mRNAs that were upregulated in the young at 96 h were related to circadian regulation (Figure 6B, left), suggesting a return to homeostasis. Of note, the 72 and 240 h time points did not show many differentially expressed mRNAs (Figures S5F and S5G). The 72 h time point likely represents a quiet phase when the young liver has mostly completed its proliferation, but the old livers have not yet induced cell cycle. In contrast, the 240 h time point may represent a return to quiescence for both young and old livers. We validated the RNA-seq results by tracing the cell proliferation marker Ki67 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Figures S5H and S6A; Table S1), IF (Figures S5I and S6B; Table S1) and RT-qPCR analyses (Figure 6C; Table S1) across the regeneration time course. We further measured the expression of additional cell cycle markers by RT-qPCR (Figure 6C). All proliferation markers peaked at 48 h post-resection in young animals, while those in old animals showed an attenuated peak at ~72–96 h. Figure 6D summarizes the dynamics of cell proliferation mRNAs across age and regeneration. These findings were validated by an independent method, ImpulseDE2,42 designed for high-throughput time series datasets (Figures S5J–S5L; Table S6).",
        "Consistent with previous reports,43–45 our results showed delayed and subdued regenerative response with age.",
        "Despite a reduction in regenerative response, a proportion of old hepatocytes entered cell cycle (Figures S5H, S5I, and S6). We reasoned that this mild proliferative event in old livers would be sufficient to dilute H3K27me3 and allow us to test epigenomic rejuvenation. Indeed, old regenerated livers (240 h post-surgery, Figure 7A) showed reduction in H3K27me3 signal after regeneration (Figure 7B, compare before and after regeneration samples; Table S1). We also noted that the differences in expression of EZH1/2 between young and old livers (Figure 5B) were abolished post-regeneration (Figure 7C). We confirmed that regeneration reversed multiple molecular aspects of aging. For example, in regenerated livers, there was an increase in H3K27me3 at developmental gene promoters by ChIP-seq (Figure 7D) which consequentially decreased expression of developmental genes (Figure 7E) restoring cell identity. We also observed there was a marked reduction in age-domains (Figure 7F). Only the global transcriptome suppression failed to be reversed (compare Figures 4K and 7G), likely because age-domains, though reduced, persist post-regeneration (Figure 7F). Nonetheless, PCA plots of both H3K27me3 patterns (Figure 7H) and transcriptome (Figure 7I) confirmed that the old regenerated livers were rejuvenated. To determine restoration of youthful function in old regenerated livers, we analyzed the expression profile of liver-enriched genes (Table S7) obtained from the Human Protein Atlas.46 Liver-enriched genes in old regenerated livers showed expression patterns that were similar to young livers (Figure 7J). Furthermore, we investigated if the genes that were upregulated with age (Figure S5D; Table S5) were downregulated by regeneration. Indeed, for a major subset of genes, this was true (Figure 7K). A minor subset of age-upregulated genes was further upregulated upon regeneration (Figure 7K). These genes are related to DNA damage-repair and acute phase response, suggesting either ongoing repair in response to acute injury (PH) or chronic injury (aging). We next inquired whether the regeneration conditions could be modeled in human HepG2 cells by simply splitting cells after contact inhibition. Indeed, H3K27me3 levels were significantly reduced, as in the liver (Figure 7L). Taken together, our data show that liver regeneration, and the ensuing replication dilution of H3K27me3, reverses multiple aspects of aging at the molecular level.",
        "Finally, we investigated whether age-domains were evident in aged quiescent tissues other than the liver, thus presenting a common epigenetic mechanism of tissue aging. We performed ChIP-seq of H3K27me3 in young and old kidney (Table S1; QC in Figures S2A and S2B). As in the aged liver, we observed age-domains of H3K27me3 across chromosomes in the aged kidney (this study), aged mouse heart and quadriceps muscle.47 The results showed evidence of H3K27me3 age-domains as in liver (Figures S7A and S7B). Furthermore, there was striking overlap in the locations of the age-domains in these tissues, although the heart was somewhat dissimilar (Figure S7C). Taken together, our results indicate that accumulation of H3K27me3 across large regions of the genome might be a universal molecular phenotype of aged quiescent tissues.",
        "In this study, we dissected the fundamental properties of aged chromatin using multi-omics and direct imaging. In the quiescent liver, hepatocytes stay viable and non-mitotic over a long lifespan (200–400 days). During the long post-mitotic phase of aged hepatocytes, we noted a paralog switching event in the enzymes catalyzing H3K27 methylation (Figure 5B). There was a decline in EZH2 expression with age which coincided with the age-related loss of H3K27me3 and EZH2 peaks at developmental gene promoters (Figures 1H, 4D, 5E, and 5F). Conversely, EZH1 protein levels increased (Figure 5B) and co-eluted with age-domains of H3K27me3 along with remnant EZH2 (Figure 5H). Histological and biochemical experiments have previously reported that EZH1 is expressed more in post-mitotic cells, has weaker methyltransferase activity, and represses transcription both in vitro and in vivo.11 Additionally, H3K27me3 is known to deposit slowly on newly replicated DNA48,49 and is maintained more on H3.3, which accumulates with age (Figure S1A).50 These properties of H3K27me3 and EZH1 agree with our observations of EZH1 expression, H3K27me3 accumulation and global transcription suppression with age.",
        "Quiescence cultures induced by contact inhibition were able to model the accumulation of H3K27me3 and the antagonistic behavior of EZH1 and EZH2 observed in aging (Figure 5C). We thus propose that aged cells are in a state of prolonged quiescence i.e., hyper-quiescence.",
        "Our work identifies a unique H3K27me3 enrichment pattern in aged tissues, megabase-scale heterochromatin domains that we call age-domains (Figures 1K, 3B, 3D, and S3). These age-domains are identified by specialized domain calling algorithms22 and are visible in chromosome-wide views. Age-domains cannot be identified in CUT&Tag type experiments that use antibody-tethered genome-cutting enzymes without sonication and efficient exposure of epitopes in heterochromatin. The size of age-domains, and the fact that they were relatively gene poor (Figure 1K), a feature of LADs,24 prompted us to probe their genomic context further. We observed that age-domains were indeed LADs (Figure 2C) and showed loss of H3K9me3 with age (Figure 2D). They were depleted of H2A119ub, H3K36me3, 5mC, and RNAPII (Figures 2E–2H). Age-domains were extracted at high salt concentrations from old samples (Figure 3B). The loss of H3K9me3-rich, lamina-associated heterochromatin domains in senescence, aging, and premature aging diseases is well established.25,51,52 Our work shows a compensatory replacement of the H3K9me3 (constitutive) with H3K27me3 (facultative) heterochromatin (Figure 2). This switch may in turn affect genome folding, a question we wish to address in the future.",
        "Upon injury, hepatocytes enter cell cycle and repopulate the liver with new cells although this function declines with age. Knowing that H3K27me3 can be reduced by replication dilution,38 we inspected the old regenerated liver (240 h post-surgery) for signs of epigenetic rejuvenation. Importantly, at 240 h post-regeneration, the liver was fully quiescent representing a state where some cells have reduced their “post-mitotic age” (Figure S6). We found that even limited proliferation was able to abolish differences in EZH1/2 expression (Figure 7C), increase H3K27me3 signals at developmental genes (Figure 7D), silence these genes (Figure 7E), reduce age-domains (Figure 7F), and partially correct age-related transcriptomic changes (Figures 7I–7K). Overall, our results demonstrate that removing H3K27me3 by controlled cell division can reset the epigenetic landscape (Figure 7M). For the same reasons, age-domains are unlikely to be seen in actively dividing cells in the body such as stem cells.",
        "We further show that many organs remain in a repressed hyper-quiescent state in vivo and form age-domains (Figure S7). Keeping tissues in a repressed, non-dividing state, may confer anti-tumor properties. Our study highlights the importance of monitoring chromatin in its native in vivo context as growth factor stimulation in cell culture may prompt cell cycle entry and replication dilution of epigenetic marks such as H3K27me3. In C. elegans, the knockdown or heterozygous mutation of the H3K27me3 demethylase, utx-1, increases H3K27me3 and extends lifespan53 further suggesting a beneficial role for this histone modification.",
        "Based on our observations, we speculate that some of the benefits of interventions such as Yamanaka factor-based reprogramming or parabiosis could be partially due to cell proliferation although they involve additional dedifferentiation events. Curiously, several reprogramming strategies have reported proliferation events in reprogrammed tissues.54–56 Similarly, heterochronic parabiosis has reported increased cell proliferation in the aged partner with reduction in repressive complexes known to inhibit proliferation.57",
        "Overall, our study suggests cell proliferation-mediated global reduction in H3K27me3 levels could be a potential strategy to ameliorate age-relate decline and disease.",
        "Although our study identifies facultative heterochromatin domains (age-domains) in old mice, our mice are only 18 months old. Age-domains may or may not exist in geriatric mice (>28 months old) or may be differently regulated. Furthermore, due to limitations with existing antibodies, the exact mechanism of how EZH1 establishes age-domains could not be investigated. The relationship between age-domains and transcriptional output has also not been directly assessed in our study. Several other outstanding questions remain: (1) what the connection between gain of age-domains and loss of H3K27me3 at peak regions is, (2) why is PRC2 binding lost at developmental promoters with age and (3) whether longevity interventions modulate age-domains.",

The qualities of the FASTQs were assessed using FASTQC/0.11.9.77 The reads were aligned to the GRCh38/hg38 genome with bowtie/2–2.4.2 using the end-to-end parameter. Sam output files were then filtered to retain alignments with a minimum mapping quality of 2 using samtools/1.9.61 Reads mapping to Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) blacklist regions were removed from the analysis. There were no statistically significant differences in sequencing depth, alignment rate or alignable fragments per million across the young and old groups in any tissue. The bamCoverage function in deepTools/3.5.0 was used to generate RPKM (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) normalized bigWig files. H3 was subtracted from H3K27me3 and IgG with bigwigCompare function of deepTools/3.5.0. Differentially enriched sites were identified using the R Bioconductor package diffReps/1.55.6.70",

        "The liver has a vital role in metabolic homeostasis, and its ability to utilize multiple mechanisms to maintain the liver-to-bodyweight ratio for proper functioning makes it an indispensable organ within the body. However, liver injury can result from various etiologies and can have significant consequences on hepatic function. Regardless of the underlying cause, liver injury commonly leads to inflammation, hepatocyte damage, and subsequent tissue remodeling. Liver injury, if left unchecked, can lead to chronic liver damage characterized by fibrosis and subsequently cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition, the regenerative capacity of the liver is also compromised. This implies that liver transplantation is the only option for end-stage chronic liver disease; however, the demand for organs far outcompetes the supply. Even worse, in a future with an aged population and an increase in liver fibrosis, the relative organ supply is expected to shrink. This review sheds light on the recent advancements in liver regeneration and the mechanisms governing it and provides an overview of potential therapeutic strategies to address the underlying problem.",
        "The innate immune response serves as a first line of defense against invading pathogens by engaging germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). These PRRs are expressed at the cell surface of innate immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells, as well as adaptive immune system cells [1]. PRRs recognize conserved molecular structures called danger-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Upon hepatic injury, stimuli molecules, DAMPs or PAMPs, are released, activating Kupffer cells, among others. This activation leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) [2]. In addition, resident macrophages or Kupffer cells and hepatocytic macrophages derived from circulating monocytes also play a crucial role in liver-related pathogenesis. This pro-inflammatory environment further perpetuates tissue injury and disrupts hepatic homeostasis.",
        "Inflammation also aggravates liver etiology by damaging the liver tissue and promoting fibrosis by activating the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to deposit excessive amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including collagen, into the liver. HSCs constitute about 5–8% of cells in the liver and play a role in retinoid storage in their quiescent form [3]. Liver injury triggers these cells, which then transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, that play a critical role in tissue repair and fibrosis. A recent study established the dual function of HSCs in hepatocarcinogenesis by analyzing mouse and human HSC subpopulations [4]. Quiescent and cytokine-producing HSCs protected hepatocytes from cell death and inhibited HCC development, while activated myofibroblastic HSCs promoted hepatocyte activation and tumor growth by altering the stiffness of the liver tissue and activating specific signaling pathways. The balance between these two HSC subpopulations also shifted during the progression of chronic liver disease, and an increased abundance of myofibroblastic HSCs was associated with a higher risk of developing HCC in patients.",
        "Liver injury also initiates compensatory mechanisms for tissue regeneration. Hepatocytes go through three distinct phases during liver regeneration that involve several growth factors and key signaling pathways that contribute to the initiation and progression of hepatocytes. The distinct phases are: initiation (also known as priming), proliferation, and termination, which are governed by many signaling mechanisms and require a balance of pro- and anti-proliferating factors to prevent oncogenesis [5].",
        "During the initial phase, hepatocytes exit their dormant state and begin the process of DNA synthesis. Two pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), are known to be the main mediators involved in the process. Following innate immune response, stimulation by components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or complement proteins upregulates TNF-α, which binds to its receptor TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) in Kupffer cells and initiates a series of intracellular signal transduction events, leading to the activation of the NF-κB pathway through a process involving the IκB kinase (IKK) complex [6]. Upon activation, the IKK complex phosphorylates IκB proteins (inhibitors of NF-κB), leading to their degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. This allows NF-κB dimers (typically p50 and p65 subunits) to be released and translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they play a pivotal role in liver regeneration by integrating signals from the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. NF-κB target genes also include growth factors (hepatocyte growth factor), anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 family members), and cell-cycle regulators (cyclin D1) [7].",
        "In the hepatocytes, IL-6 binds to IL-6R, leading to the formation of a complex with glycoprotein 130 (gp130), which activates downstream signaling pathways. The IL-6R/gp130 complex activates the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. This results in the initiation of cell proliferation via Cyclin D1. TNF-α, on the other hand, stimulates hepatocyte c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which leads to the phosphorylation of c-Jun transcription factor in the nucleus. This activation induces the transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which promotes hepatocyte proliferation [6,7].",
        "Thus, the activation of NF-κB and subsequent transcriptional changes contribute to hepatocyte proliferation by promoting the expression of genes required for cell-cycle progression. Additionally, NF-κB-mediated induction of anti-apoptotic proteins enhances hepatocyte survival in the context of the inflammatory microenvironment. However, it is important that NF-κB activity is tightly regulated to avoid prolonged inflammation, which could lead to tissue damage [6]. Subsequently, hepatocytes reach the G1 and early S phases of the cell cycle by several signals that activate growth factors and mitogens, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Cellular proliferation stops when the body mass ratio is attained and inhibitory molecules such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) restrict the rate and direction of liver regeneration [7] (Figure 1).",
        "In addition to hepatocytes, another subpopulation in the liver known as liver progenitor cells (LPCs) is known to play a role in liver regeneration. Oval cells, the first liver progenitor cells, are a cell population capable of differentiating into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, the major cell types of the liver [8]. Experimental models using lineage tracing studies have explored this differentiation potential in response to liver injury [9,10]. While one study showed Sox9-positive cells to be involved in regeneration after liver injury, another showed that Sox9-positive cells primarily contribute to oval cell proliferation and the formation of organoids but rarely give rise to hepatocytes in vivo. Thus, although Sox9, a transcription factor and cholangiocyte marker, has been studied in different stages of organ development, homeostasis, and regeneration, along with other markers, the role of LPCs in regeneration still requires further investigation.",
        "Studies have also found that other non-parenchymal cell (NPC) populations, such as biliary epithelial cells (BECs), play a role in hepatocyte regeneration. A study showed that NPC-derived hepatocytes accounted for a substantial portion of the regenerated liver tissue. By utilizing a marker called cytokeratin 19 (CK19), BECs were identified as a crucial source of hepatocyte regeneration, particularly in cases of chronic liver injury [11,12].",
        "While the precise mechanisms underlying different cell-type populations, their differentiation, and their interaction with the liver microenvironment are still being elucidated, advances in research have provided valuable insights into these processes. Further research is needed to fully understand their molecular and cellular characteristics and their potential clinical applications.",
        "The extraordinary regenerative power of the liver was already known in ancient times, as described in the Greek tale of Prometheus, who was punished by the gods for stealing the fire. As punishment, Prometheus was chained to a rock and an eagle ate pieces of his liver every day, only so that the liver regenerated overnight, and the torture started all over again. However, a breakthrough for liver regeneration research and the foundation for a detailed understanding of the mechanism was presented by Higgins and Anderson in 1931 [13]. They showed that a two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PHx) induced a reliable liver regeneration response. This was possible as acute damage to the liver induced a synchronous response of the remaining cells. Many researchers used this model to dissect the underlying molecular changes of the regeneration process. Interestingly, if the surgical insult is limited to under 50%, the regeneration program mainly changes from hyperplasia to hypertrophy [14]. This indicates that more than one regenerative response is possible.",
        "Despite the understanding of the molecular mechanism of liver regeneration, the PHx model does not reflect the most common situation of chronic liver disease. Chronic liver disease triggered by hepatitis viruses or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) does not result in massive acute damage but a persistent insult. This triggers a continuous turnover of cells, hepatocyte death, and a continuous compensatory local regeneration. Over time, the regenerative capacity of the hepatocytes is exhausted, and a second line of defense is triggered, followed by the activation of a stem cell compartment and the oval cells of the liver. However, the stem cells are not able to fully compensate for the hepatocytic loss, leading to increased accumulation of fibrotic scar tissue and finally end-stage liver disease.",
        "This raises the question whether the understanding gained from the acute liver damage model of PHx is sufficient to understand chronic liver disease and its progression to end-stage liver disease. As discussed earlier, pro-inflammatory signals such as TNF- α and IL-1β are important to trigger hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle and proliferate. However, chronic liver damage leads to chronic inflammation, which drives fibrosis, hepatocyte exhaustion, and disease progression [15,16]. In addition, continuous liver insult might disrupt the classic liver regeneration program seen in acute liver damage. Chronic liver damage also leads to the accumulation of senescent cells [17], cells that are permanently arrested in their cell cycle. Senescent hepatocytes therefore cannot contribute to liver regeneration and can even induce senescence in other cells via paracrine mechanisms. Over time, significant loss of hepatocytes is seen, which could contribute to inefficient liver regeneration. This explains the regenerative decline under chronic liver disease and aging. However, what was also found is that the regenerative program, when triggered, is not only strong but can initiate senescence escape, thereby contributing to liver cancer [18]. This highlights that by eliminating senescent hepatocytes the regenerative power of the liver under chronic liver disease and aging can be improved. This phenomenon has so far been observed in animal models [19,20,21].",
        "Despite the decline in the regenerative response of hepatocytes under chronic liver damage and aging, serial hepatocyte transplantation experiments [22] have shown the potential of hepatocytes in contributing towards long-term liver regeneration. Additionally, functional genomics dissecting the biology, especially in the context of chronic liver damage, have helped to identify new drivers of liver regeneration [23,24]. In the future, advances in single-cell analytical techniques covering transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenetic changes will help unravel the complex regenerative microenvironment induced by chronic liver damage and pave the way towards promising therapeutic targets.",
        "Several key signaling pathways play a critical role in enhancing liver regeneration and promoting the proliferation and differentiation of hepatocytes. Understanding these signaling pathways is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance liver regeneration in various liver diseases and injuries.",
        "The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a key signaling pathway in liver regeneration. Wnt ligands bind to frizzled receptors and coreceptors, resulting in the stabilization and deposition of β-catenin in the cytoplasm [25]. This accumulated β-catenin in the cell interacts with transcription factors to regulate gene expression and activate target genes involved in cell-cycle progression. In the liver, Wnt signaling is crucial for tissue regeneration and metabolic zonation and contributes to various liver diseases, including liver cancer [26].",
        "Several regulators control the Wnt pathway, including the two negative regulators called Rnf43 and Znrf3 [27,28], which are responsible for the degradation of frizzled receptors of the pathway. Mutations in these have been found in human cancers, but their role in liver disease is not well understood. In one study, researchers specifically deleted Rnf43 and Znrf3 in adult hepatocytes and observed degeneration of the liver, increased unsaturated lipids, altered lipid distribution, and steatohepatitis [29]. The loss of Rnf43/Znrf3 also affected hepatocyte proliferation. These effects were partially explained by cell-autonomous mechanisms, as liver organoids lacking Rnf43/Znrf3 showed lipid accumulation and reduced differentiation capacity. These findings are consistent with clinical observations of liver cancer patients with RNF43/ZNRF3 mutations who also exhibit metabolic abnormalities and poorer prognosis.",
        "The Notch signaling pathway, which regulates cell fate during development, has been found to be dysregulated in obese rodents and individuals with NAFLD. In the liver, Notch activation promotes the differentiation of hepatic progenitor cells into cholangiocytes, while inactive Notch signaling supports the development of hepatocytes [30]. To investigate the role of hepatocyte-specific Notch activation in NASH, researchers conducted studies using mice fed with a specific diet that induces NASH and fibrosis [30]. They found that hepatocyte-specific loss of Notch function reduced liver fibrosis without affecting hepatocellular injury or inflammation. Conversely, forced activation of hepatocyte Notch signaling led to fibrosis development. The researchers also identified the involvement of specific genes, sex-determining region Y-box 9 (Sox9) and Sox9-dependent expression encoding the secreted fibrogenic factor Osteopontin (Spp1), in the fibrotic process. Furthermore, treating NASH mice with a Notch antagonist resulted in decreased liver fibrosis. Interestingly, it was also observed that Notch activity is increased in hepatocytes of patients with NASH.",
        "In another study, the researchers aimed to investigate the role of highly specialized NPCs of the liver called liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) in the regeneration process [31]. They specifically investigated the expression and function of c-kit, a stem cell marker and type III receptor tyrosine kinase, in SECs [32]. The study revealed that c-kit was predominantly expressed in SECs and that c-kit+ SECs played a crucial role in inducing hepatocyte proliferation following partial hepatectomy (PH) via angiocrine signaling [33]. Its distribution was found to be closely associated with the expression pattern of the liver zonation marker Wnt2, indicating a connection between c-kit+ SECs and liver zonation. Mutations in the Notch pathway affected the distribution of c-kit and liver zonation, leading to altered hepatocyte proliferation. Activation of the Notch pathway hindered liver regeneration by inhibiting the positive effects of c-kit+ SECs on hepatocytes. Moreover, aside from their involvement in liver regeneration, c-kit+ SECs were seen to have therapeutic potential in attenuating liver injury induced by toxins. Infusion of c-kit+ SECs in mice protected against liver damage induced by toxins.",
        "These findings suggest that hepatocyte-specific Notch signaling plays a crucial role in the development of the liver by regulating cell fate decisions and tissue homeostasis. Modulating Notch signaling can influence liver regeneration and the balance between liver progenitor cell-mediated repair and hepatocyte proliferation.",
        "Another signaling pathway, Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), plays a critical role in liver regeneration by mediating the response to various growth factors and cytokines. Binding of these factors to their receptors leads to the activation of their respective intrinsic kinases. For example, as discussed earlier, binding of IL-6 to its receptor on hepatocytes initiates the activation of Janus kinases (JAKs), which leads to the phosphorylation of STAT3 [7]. Phosphorylated STAT3 forms homodimers or heterodimers and translocates to the nucleus, where the dimers bind to specific DNA sequences known as STAT-binding elements (SBEs) in the promoters of target genes [34]. This binding activates transcription of various genes involved in cell proliferation or cell-cycle progression.",
        "Moh et al. investigated the direct effect of STAT3 on liver tissues by generating liver-specific STAT3 knockout mice [35]. Higher mortality rates were observed in the mice less than 24 h after PHx, suggesting that STAT3 is required for survival in the early stages of liver regeneration. Surviving STAT3 knockout mice showed reduced DNA synthesis but were able to restore their liver mass, implying that, while STAT3 may play a role in hepatocyte proliferation, other compensatory mechanisms might also be involved during the process. Carbon tetrachloride-treated STAT3 knockout mice showed increased infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes in the liver, indicating an exaggerated inflammatory response after hepatocyte necrosis, suggesting that STAT3 deficiency might influence immune regulation and contribute to inflammation. In addition to IL6, activation of STAT3 by IL-22 is known to play a role in hepatoprotection. Radaeva et al. demonstrated increased IL-22 expression in T cell-mediated hepatitis. Blocking IL-22 worsened liver injury and reduced STAT3 activation, while administering recombinant IL-22 prevented liver injury, indicating its protective role in hepatocytes [36]. Abdelnabi et al. reported a sex-dependent hepatoprotective role of IL-22 in NAFLD and showed that lack of IL-22 receptor signaling in female mice exacerbated liver injury, apoptosis, inflammation, and liver fibrosis [37].",
        "The Hippo/Yap signaling pathway has emerged as a critical regulator of liver injury and regeneration, playing a significant role in maintaining liver balance and promoting hepatocyte proliferation. Activation of this pathway leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of the YAP protein, which regulates gene expression and cell proliferation [38]. Conversely, liver-specific deletion of key Hippo pathway kinases results in hepatocyte proliferation because of YAP overexpression [39]. Research has also shed light on the role of Hippo/YAP signaling in liver cell fate determination [40]. Elevated YAP activity is associated with hepatic progenitor identity. When YAP is ectopically activated in differentiated hepatocytes, it causes their de-differentiation, liver overgrowth, and the emergence of oval cells. The Notch signaling pathway has been identified as an important downstream target of YAP in these cells.",
        "Another study found that YAP/TAZ are not crucial for liver development and regeneration in hepatocytes. Instead, they indirectly contribute to liver regeneration by maintaining the integrity of bile ducts and ensuring proper immune cell recruitment and function [41]. The researchers observed that in response to the liver injury caused by carbon tetrachloride, the YAP/TAZ were activated in hepatocytes. However, when Yap/Taz were specifically deleted in adult hepatocytes, there was no significant impairment in liver regeneration. On the contrary, when Yap/Taz genes were deleted in adult bile ducts, which are the tubes that carry bile in the liver, severe defects and delays in liver regeneration were observed. Further investigation revealed that the mutant bile ducts underwent degeneration, leading to a condition called cholestasis, which is characterized by the buildup of bile in the liver. This cholestasis hindered the recruitment of phagocytic macrophages, which are immune cells that help clear cellular debris from the injury sites. The elevated levels of bile acids activated a transcription factor called the pregnane X receptor, whose activation by an agonist recapitulated the defects observed in the mutant mice.",
        "In addition to the above pathways, other pathways, such as the EGF receptor (EGFR) pathway and the HGF/c-Met pathway, also play a significant role in regulating hepatocyte proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation during liver regeneration.",
        "In one study, researchers used two methods to investigate the role of a protein called β1-integrin (Itgb1) in liver regeneration: inducible gene deletion using Cre/loxP-mediated gene deletion and nanoparticle-encapsulated small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Itgb1 [42]. By studying genetically modified mice, they were able to understand how specific proteins contribute to the process of liver regeneration. While Itgb1 was shown to be essential for liver regeneration, they also found that Itgb1 cooperates with growth factor signaling components—HGF, c-Met, and EGFR—which are known to play crucial roles in liver regeneration [43,44]. When c-Met or EGFR was deleted in the liver, it led to diminished hepatocyte proliferation and impaired liver regeneration.",
        "In summary, the signaling pathways play a critical role in liver injury and regeneration. They regulate hepatocyte proliferation, survival, and tissue repair in response to liver injury. Dysregulation or impairment of these pathways can lead to impaired liver regeneration, delayed wound healing, or the development of liver diseases, such as fibrosis and cirrhosis (Figure 2). Therefore, targeting these signaling pathways and their components holds great potential for therapeutic interventions to enhance liver regeneration in various liver diseases and injuries. Understanding the intricate mechanisms of these signaling pathways will provide new insights into liver regeneration and may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches for liver diseases.",
        "While much research has focused on understanding the signals that promote liver regeneration, less is known about the mechanisms that control its termination and the factors that suppress excessive cell growth. These proliferation inhibitors play a crucial role in preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation and the development of liver tumors.",
        "One example of a proliferation inhibitor is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ), a nuclear receptor that regulates cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells. Research has demonstrated an inverse relationship between PPAR-γ expression and liver regeneration, as its levels decrease shortly after PH but increase during later stages of regeneration. Treatment with pioglitazone, a PPAR-γ agonist, has been shown to suppress liver cell proliferation [45].",
        "Vitamin D3 upregulated protein 1 (VDUP1) is another regulator of cell proliferation that is negatively correlated with liver regeneration. Research has demonstrated that mice lacking VDUP1 show enhanced proliferative responses during liver regeneration, characterized by increased expression of cell-cycle proteins and activation of proliferative signals [46].",
        "Transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain containing 1 (Tmub1) is another identified gene that has been observed to be upregulated during later stages of liver regeneration. It has a negative effect on hepatocyte proliferation induced by IL-6, suggesting its role in regulating liver cell growth [47]. The expression of Tmub1 may be under the control of IL-6 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ), which is a crucial transcription factor associated with IL-6 signaling [48].",
        "TGF-β is a pleiotropic cytokine that has both pro-regenerative and anti-regenerative effects on the liver, depending on the context. In the initial phase of liver regeneration, TGF-β signaling suppresses hepatocyte proliferation to prevent excessive cell growth. Early studies demonstrated that TGF-β, derived from platelets, inhibits DNA synthesis in adult rat hepatocytes and suppresses liver regeneration in animal models [5]. Other studies showed TGF-β expression to increase at 4 h and cease at 72 h following PHx, coinciding with the cessation of DNA synthesis, indicating its involvement in the inhibition and termination of liver regeneration [49,50]. Additionally, TGF-β is known to act through EGF and HGF inhibition [49,51], among other mechanisms, and therefore modulating its signaling can help fine-tune the regenerative response in liver diseases and injuries.",
        "These examples highlight the importance of proliferation inhibitors in controlling liver regeneration and preventing excessive cell growth. Understanding the mechanisms by which these inhibitors function can provide valuable insights into the regulation of liver regeneration and the development of potential therapeutic strategies.",
        "Recent advancements in the field of liver injury and regeneration have shed light on key mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches. One such approach is hepatocyte transplantation that involves the transplantation of functional hepatocytes into a patient’s liver to replace or supplement the lost or damaged liver function. Hepatocyte transplantation offers advantages over whole organ transplantation, including the ability to keep the native liver intact, and holds promise for treating various liver diseases, such as acute liver failure, and certain metabolic disorders [52]. However, the limited availability of high-quality hepatocytes remains a concern. Long-term engraftment and survival of transplanted hepatocytes remains challenging as transplanted cells experience a decline in functionality and numbers, potentially requiring repeated transplantations. Immune rejection might also lead to reduced survival and functionality of transplanted cells. To overcome this, current research is focused on identifying alternative cell sources for transplantation, including stem cells, fetal hepatoblasts or hepatocytes, and immortalized cells. Efforts to generate and expand human hepatocytes in animals, as seen in humanized liver mice, are ongoing but have met with limitations, such as immune response or the risk of zoonotic diseases. Nevertheless, efforts are aimed to address the shortage of donor hepatocytes and expand the potential applications of hepatocyte transplantation in treating a wide range of liver diseases. Some of the other therapeutic approaches are discussed below.",
        "Advances in gene therapy and genome editing technologies have offered new avenues for studying liver metabolism and treating liver diseases. Gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of liver disease and regeneration. CRISPR-Cas9 allows precise modifications of specific genes, enabling researchers to target and edit disease-causing mutations or manipulate genes involved in liver regeneration processes.",
        "In 2014, Xue et al. used hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HDTV) to deliver CRISPR plasmid DNA into the livers of wild-type mice, targeting Phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) and p53, two tumor suppressor genes [53]. Mutating Pten led to an increase in Akt phosphorylation and accumulation of lipids in the liver cells, mimicking the effects of deleting the gene using conventional methods. Shortly after, another group of researchers delivered a Cas9 system targeting the Pten gene in animal liver using an adenoviral vector [54]. The delivery of Cas9 resulted in efficient gene editing, although the immune responses associated with the adenoviral vector were present. Four months post-treatment, mice that received the Pten gene edited adenovial vector showed liver enlargement and features of NASH. These studies provided some of the first human liver disease models in vivo.",
        "Yin et al. used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to correct a mutation in the fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) gene in the livers of mice with hereditary tyrosinemia, a genetic disease [55]. They delivered the CRISPR-Cas9 components to the liver using HDTV, resulting in the expression of the wild-type Fah protein in a small percentage of liver cells. The expansion of these corrected cells led to the rescue of the bodyweight loss associated with the disease. In another study, researchers used a combination of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and adeno-associated viruses to deliver Cas9 mRNA, guide RNA (sgRNA), and a repair template DNA to correct mutation in the FAH gene [56]. One study identified four novel liver tumor suppressor genes, Nf1, Plxnb1, Flrt2, and B9d1, by conducting a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout screen targeting 20,611 genes in mice using liver progenitor cells that overexpressed Myc and lacked p53 [57].",
        "Despite its immense potential, gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 faces challenges. Efficient delivery of CRISPR components to target liver cells remains a hurdle, requiring the development of safe and effective delivery methods. Off-target effects and immune responses to CRISPR components are other considerations that need to be addressed to ensure the safety and long-term efficacy of gene editing therapies.",
        "Stem cells offer a remarkable capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into diverse cell types, making them a promising avenue for liver disease treatment. Different types of stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have been extensively studied for their regenerative abilities. These stem cells possess self-renewal and differentiation capabilities and contribute towards tissue repair and regeneration.",
        "MSCs are cells with a fibroblast-like appearance that possess the ability to differentiate into various cell types, including hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs). They have the capability to secrete cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors which support tissue repair and regeneration and exhibit immunomodulatory properties [58,59]. Liu et al. investigated their effect on liver regeneration and explored the underlying mechanisms. The findings revealed that the infusion of MSCs improved liver regeneration by enhancing cell proliferation and growth in the early stages after PHx [60]. Additionally, MSCs restored liver synthesis function and reduced lipid accumulation through the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. The infusion of MSCs also promoted a proinflammatory environment characterized by increased expression of IL-6 and IL-1β, activated the STAT3 and Hippo-YAP pathways, and consequently led to enhanced cell proliferation. The researchers concluded that MSCs enhanced liver function and facilitated liver regeneration after extensive resection through paracrine mechanisms. These observations indicate that MSCs hold promise as a potential therapeutic approach for treating acute liver failure following hepatectomy.",
        "In addition to their differentiation potential, factors such as conditioned medium derived from MSC cultures and human umbilical cord MSC-derived exosomes (hUCMSC-EVs) have been shown to promote liver regeneration in a rat model of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by modulating inflammatory responses, reducing apoptosis and reducing oxidative stress [61,62]. In addition, extracellular vesicles from a newly derived stem cell population called human liver stem cells (HLSCs) have been shown to contribute towards tissue repair and regeneration [63]. HLSCs were first identified in 2006 through a unique cultivation method that involved stringent culture conditions. This technique allowed mature hepatocytes to undergo cell death, leaving behind expandable clones of HLSCs that exhibited remarkable multipotent capabilities [64]. HLSCs can further differentiate into a variety of cell types, including hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and islet-like cell organoids, under controlled laboratory conditions. In addition, HLSCs express markers associated with both MSCs and hepatocytes, indicating a partial commitment toward hepatic lineage. Importantly, HLSCs exhibit immunomodulatory properties, inhibiting the activation of immune cells such as T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells [63]. While HLSCs hold significant potential for various therapeutic applications, their full potential is still being explored. By leveraging the immunomodulatory and regenerative properties of HLSCs, research could pave the way for novel treatments that could significantly impact the field of liver disease management.",
        "Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), abundant in the bone marrow, have also been investigated for their potential in liver regeneration. Transplantation of HSPCs into fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)-deficient mice showed that they could transdifferentiate into functional hepatocytes, leading to the regeneration of the injured liver, thus correcting the phenotype in a mouse model of human tyrosinemia type I [65].",
        "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), generated by reprogramming adult cells, have the ability to differentiate into various cell types, including HLCs. They offer advantages such as expandability, bankability, and reproducibility. iPSC-derived HLCs have been used for disease modeling and have shown potential for liver regeneration in animal models [59]. In addition, patient-specific iPSCs can also be generated, avoiding issues of immune rejection, and therefore hold great potential for regenerative medicine and personalized therapies.",
        "The use of stem cells represents a promising avenue for liver disease and regeneration. By harnessing the regenerative potential of stem cells, promoting endogenous repair mechanisms, and delivering therapeutic factors, stem-cell-based approaches have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of liver diseases, improve patient outcomes, and reduce the need for liver transplantation.",
        "The use of stem cells in combination with tissue engineering approaches, such as hydrogels and scaffolds, holds further promise for enhancing liver regeneration and transplantation outcomes.",
        "Scaffold-based liver tissue engineering involves using specialized structures made from natural or synthetic materials. These structures, called scaffolds, are designed to mimic the ECM of the liver. The ECM provides a supportive environment for cells by promoting attachment, growth, and specialization [66]. Decellularized liver scaffolds, created by removing cellular components while preserving the ECM, can be re-seeded with live cells to regenerate liver tissue [66]. Various cell sources can be used for recellularization, including primary hepatocytes, iPSCs, and MSCs. The use of scaffold-based approaches has shown promise in improving liver function and promoting tissue regeneration in animal models. Previously, the therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-EVs) for liver diseases was discussed. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the rapid clearance of MSC-EVs from the liver, limiting their impact. To address this challenge, researchers developed a sustained release approach utilizing clickable polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels [67]. MSC-EVs were encapsulated within these hydrogels, allowing for gradual release over a period of one month. In a rat model of chronic liver fibrosis, the sustained release of MSC-EVs from the hydrogels demonstrated superior antifibrosis, anti-apoptosis, and regenerative effects when compared to the conventional injection of MSC-EVs without hydrogel encapsulation. This sustained delivery strategy extends the availability and therapeutic benefits of MSC-EVs in the context of chronic liver failure.",
        "Three-dimensional bioprinting is an advanced technique in tissue engineering that enables the precise fabrication of 3D structures using live cells [68]. Bioprinting allows for the creation of biomimetic liver tissue that closely mimics the microenvironment of the liver [69]. Bioprinted liver tissues have demonstrated the ability to recapitulate drug-induced fibrogenesis and show phenotypic and functional enhancements of cells [70]. Bioprinting has also been used to generate liver organoids for transplantation [71].",
        "However, despite the advancements, challenges remain. Proper vascularization of engineered tissues is crucial for long-term survival and function. Complex vascular networks, mimicking the natural anatomy of the liver, are still difficult to fabricate using current bioprinting techniques. Strategies such as incorporating angiogenesis growth factors, coculturing endothelial cells, and creating microchannels have been explored to improve vascularization [72].",
        "Liver organoids or three-dimensional cell culture systems that mimic the structural and functional attributes of the liver have emerged as valuable tools for studying hepatic biology, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine [73]. Liver organoids can be generated from various cell sources, such as iPSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and provide more physiologically relevant and scalable models compared to traditional two-dimensional cell cultures. Tsuchida et al. demonstrated a safe and effective treatment for chronic liver damage in rats by transplanting liver organoids into the liver through the portal vein. The method helped to regenerate damaged livers and showed promising results in improving liver function and survival rates [74]. Organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells have also been used to model various liver diseases, such as steatosis and steatohepatitis. In one study, researchers successfully co-differentiated epithelial and stromal lineages from pluripotent stem cells to create multicellular liver organoids [75]. These organoids, when treated with free fatty acids, demonstrate the progressive development of pathology similar to steatohepatitis, involving accumulation of fat, inflammation, and fibrosis. The stiffness of the organoids could also be used as a biophysical readout to assess fibrosis severity. This organoid culture system provided a robust platform for modeling complex liver diseases and drug screening. In another study, researchers successfully differentiated organoids into functional hepatocytes and cholangiocytes [76]. When exposed to free fatty acids, the hepatic organoids exhibited gene expression patterns resembling those found in liver tissues of patients with NASH. Furthermore, incubation with free fatty acids resulted in structural alterations characteristic of NASH. This hepatic organoid platform provided a valuable tool for modeling complex liver diseases.",
        "Liver organoids offer several advantages, including disease modeling, drug testing, and developmental studies. However, like any other experimental model, liver organoids have their limitations, such as capturing the full complexity of the native organ, achieving fully mature hepatocytes, and challenges, such as the long-term viability and functionality of organoids, exist [77,78].",
        "In addition, while liver organoids offer valuable insights into liver biology, they often do not accurately replicate the complex architecture of the liver lobule due to their limited vascularization [79]. Liver organoids provide a more uniform microenvironment compared to the distinct gradients seen in the native liver lobule. This uniformity fails to mimic the molecular gradients that drive zonal gene expression. The spatial arrangement of cell types in liver organoids also differs from that in the native liver, which affects cellular interactions and signaling gradients critical for zonal differentiation.",
        "Liver organoids also show limitations in capturing the interactions that extend beyond the liver itself. The broader systemic interactions, such as those with the intestinal barrier, the nervous system, and the immune system, cannot be fully replicated in an isolated in vitro model. Researchers studying liver diseases and treatments should therefore complement organoid studies with in vivo and ex vivo models to gain a more comprehensive understanding of liver pathology.",
        "Despite these limitations, liver organoids still offer valuable insights into liver biology and disease, and ongoing research is focused on improving their functionality and relevance for various applications. Strategies to enhance vascularization, cellular composition, and spatial organization within organoids are actively being pursued to address these limitations and make them more representative of the native liver’s architecture and functions.",
        "In conclusion, liver organoids are in vitro models that replicate in part the complexity and functionality of the liver tissue. They offer a powerful platform for personalized medicine and hold great potential for disease-specific therapeutic strategies. Recognizing their advantages and disadvantages is crucial for effectively interpreting experimental results, and continued research should be aimed at addressing these limitations and improving the utility of liver organoids for various applications.",
        "The adequate understanding of the intrinsic molecular pathogenesis of liver disorders has also led to a surge in research efforts towards altering expression levels of specific genes involved in the pathophysiology of various diseases using RNA interference (RNAi). In addition, there is a growing pool of oligonucleotide-based therapies in clinical trials that have shown promising potential against various diseases. Oligonucleotide-based therapeutics include siRNA, anti-miRs, miRNA mimics, and antisense oligonucleotides. These therapeutics modulate gene expression, provide high-level specificity, and reduce off-target effects.",
        "siRNA-based therapeutics have gained significant attention in recent years, and several siRNA drugs have been approved for specific indications due to the recent advancement in the development of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) siRNA conjugates. The GalNAc moiety acts as a ligand and binds to a receptor called asialoglycoprotein (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes [80]. GalNAc-siRNA conjugates can be injected subcutaneously, efficiently taken up by liver cells, and subsequently released to induce a therapeutic effect.",
        "Onpattro™ (Patisiran) was the first approved siRNA-based therapeutic, used for hereditary polyneuropathy [81]. It was formulated as a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that serves as a versatile platform for delivering therapeutic molecules, including nucleic acids and drugs, and is delivered directly to liver cells. Vutrisiran (HELIOS-A), a second-generation siRNA drug, is now approved for the same indication. Vutrisiran targets the same mRNA as Onpattro but is conjugated with a GalNAc molecule which enhances its stability [82]. Some of the other GalNAc-siRNA conjugates approved are Givlaari (givosiran) for acute hepatic porphyria [83], Leqvio (inclisiran) for adults with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia [84], and Olpasiran, which targets apolipoprotein A [85].",
        "While siRNA-based therapeutics are showing promising results in preclinical and clinical studies, there are still challenges to overcome. These include improving the stability, specificity, and delivery efficiency of siRNA molecules, as well as addressing potential off-target effects and immune responses. To overcome the limitation of siRNA delivery, researchers used gold nanoparticles modified with branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), a cationic polymer, for the delivery of siRNA against the c-Myc gene, which is overexpressed in HCC [86]. The nanoparticles showed high cellular uptake, no significant toxicity, and successful delivery of siRNA to cancer cells, resulting in significant gene silencing.",
        "Another method utilized a nanocomplex to deliver siRNA to liver cells. This complex consisted of protamine, which neutralizes the anticoagulant effect of heparin, and siRNA targeting AKT. The complex was enveloped by a conjugate of hyaluronic acid and taurocholic acid (HA-TCA). This conjugation assisted the complex in penetrating the cells and escaping from endosomes, protecting the siRNA from the harsh gastric environment [87]. The complex effectively reached liver cancer cells due to the recycling system of enterohepatic bile acids induced by TCA. The controlled release of siRNA was achieved through the degradation of the conjugate by the enzyme hyaluronidase present in cancer cells. The uptake by hyaluronic acid receptors in liver cancer cells led to the retardation of cancer cell growth and reduction in tumor size in a murine model of colorectal liver metastasis.",
        "A recent study studied the therapeutic potential of targeting c-Jun N-terminal kinase-2 (Jnk2) in chronic liver disease (CLD) and end-stage liver cancer [88]. A hepatocyte-specific lipid-based siRNA formulation called siJnk2, using the LNP system, was developed. Treatment with siJnk2 resulted in reduced apoptotic cell death and attenuated hepatocarcinogenesis. siJnk2 treatment also led to decreased fibrogenesis, ameliorated markers of hepatic damage, and reduced the formation of premalignant nodules, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect in inhibiting tumor initiation.",
        "Recently, STP707, an siRNA-based therapy, received FDA approval to proceed with clinical trials for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic liver disease characterized by inflammation of the bile ducts (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03841448, accessed on 19 July 2023). STP707 is based on a combination therapy, specifically targeting two key molecules, TGF-β1 and COX-2, known to be overexpressed in different liver cells, including Kupffer cells and liver SECs. Intravenous administration of STP707 successfully reduced the expression of the targeted genes in preclinical studies, exhibited a good safety profile, and demonstrated anti-fibrotic activity.",
        "These studies highlight different approaches for delivering siRNA to target specific genes involved in liver diseases, with promising outcomes in gene silencing and inhibition of cancer progression. Ongoing research and advancements in siRNA design as well as delivery systems hold great potential in developing siRNA-based therapeutics for various diseases.",
        "Single-cell transcriptomics is a powerful technique that has revolutionized our understanding of the liver’s architecture at a cellular level. Advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has provided unprecedented insights into the cellular composition, cell states, and intercellular communication within the liver microenvironment.",
        "scRNA-seq has enabled the discovery of previously uncharacterized cell types and states in the liver. MacParland et al. obtained liver tissues from five healthy donors and analyzed the transcriptional profiles of 8444 individual liver cells. The researchers not only identified 20 distinct cell populations within the liver but also discovered two different populations of the macrophages of the liver along with distinct functions, thereby providing an in-depth view at a cellular level [89]. Ramachandran et al. profiled transcriptomics of over 100,000 human liver cells from healthy and cirrhotic individuals, identified different cell types present in the liver, and uncovered novel subpopulations of macrophages (characterized by the expression of TREM2 and CD9) and endothelial cells (expressed ACKR1 and PLVAP) that are associated with liver fibrosis, thus enabling the discovery of therapeutic targets [90].",
        "scRNA-seq coupled with computational analyses has allowed the study of intercellular communication and signaling networks within the liver microenvironment during injury and regeneration. By conducting ligand–receptor modeling, researchers investigated the interactions between scar-associated macrophages, endothelial cells, and collagen-producing mesenchymal cells. They identified several signaling pathways, including TNF receptor superfamily member 12A (TNFRSF12A), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR), and Notch signaling, that were involved in promoting fibrosis within the scarred areas of the liver [90]. This provided insights into the crosstalk between different cell populations and the signaling pathways involved in liver regeneration.",
        "In another study, researchers aimed to understand how heterotypic interactions in 3D organoids affect lineage identity during liver development [91]. They used scRNA-seq to analyze the gene expression pattern of human liver cells in both 2D culture and 3D liver bud organoids. They reconstructed the lineage progression of HLCs from pluripotent stem cells in 2D culture and observed the emergence of heterogeneity during hepatoblast differentiation. They then compared the 3D liver bud organoids to fetal and adult human liver cells and uncovered a striking similarity between the organoids and fetal liver cells. Lastly, using receptor–ligand pairing analysis and inhibitor assays, the researchers investigated the signaling pathways involved in liver bud development and found vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling to promote endothelial network formation and hepatoblast differentiation in the organoids. The study provides insights into the cellular and molecular processes involved in liver development and the influence of cell–cell interactions on lineage identity. The utilization of 3D liver bud organoids provides an invaluable model system for investigating liver development and holds promise in advancing the development of regenerative therapies for liver diseases.",
        "Single-cell transcriptomics has emerged as a powerful technique for dissecting cellular heterogeneity and molecular dynamics. Researchers employed scRNA-seq to examine the heterogeneity of BECs and hepatocytes in healthy and injured livers [92]. Researchers found significant heterogeneity in homeostatic BECs, which was associated with the activation of a YAP-dependent program. This dynamic cellular state was responsive to injury and played a role in BEC survival and hepatocyte reprogramming into biliary progenitors. The findings highlight the molecular heterogeneity within the ductal epithelium of the liver and emphasize the regulatory role of YAP in liver regeneration.",
        "Single-cell transcriptomics has provided a comprehensive understanding of the gene regulatory networks that orchestrate tissue repair and regeneration following liver injury. To understand the dynamics of liver regeneration, researchers used spatially resolved scRNA-seq to investigate the regeneration process in mouse liver after acute acetaminophen (APAP) intoxication [93]. The study revealed that hepatocytes across the liver lobule engaged in proliferation, exerting the necessary mitotic pressure to swiftly replenish the damaged pericentral zone (a central region surrounding the central vein that plays a critical role in various metabolic functions). During the regeneration process, a specific subset of hepatocytes at the regenerating front exhibited transient upregulation of fetal-specific genes as they underwent reprogramming into a pericentral state. Moreover, distinct cell populations, including endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and macrophages, demonstrated specific or zone-specific roles in immune recruitment, proliferation, and matrix remodeling throughout the regeneration phase. These findings provide valuable insights into the coordinated programs involved in zonal liver regeneration.",
        "Another group delved into the regenerative potential of the adult liver and sought to unravel the underlying mechanisms that enable it to restore both mass and function following injury. They utilized a PHx mouse model and employed scRNA-seq as well as a single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-Seq) analyses on approximately 13,000 individual hepatocytes [94]. The study uncovered that, following PHx, the hepatocytes exhibited diversification into multiple distinct populations characterized by different functional attributes. Some hepatocytes retained the chromatin landscapes and transcriptomes akin to undamaged adult liver cells, while others underwent a transition, acquiring fetal-like characteristics that rendered them more proliferative and instrumental in the regeneration process. Additionally, the research shed light on the heterogeneity and dynamic nature of hepatocyte responses during liver regeneration. Despite maximal proliferative activity, a significant portion of hepatocytes retained the chromatin landscape and metabolic functions of healthy hepatocytes, indicating their commitment to maintaining essential liver-specific metabolic responsibilities. On the other hand, a larger population of hepatocytes exhibited changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression associated with liver development and regeneration, suggesting a transition towards a more proliferative state. The researchers also demonstrated that epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in orchestrating and coordinating these complex cell state transitions during liver regeneration. Overall, the study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying liver regeneration and the balance between increased proliferative activity and the maintenance of vital liver-specific functions. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that drive these cellular transitions will be crucial for understanding defective liver repair, liver failure, and carcinogenesis and may contribute to the development of novel approaches for preventing and treating liver-related conditions.",
        "Overall, scRNA-seq has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting the cellular heterogeneity, lineage trajectories, and molecular mechanisms underlying liver injury and regeneration. It has the potential to drive the development of novel therapeutic strategies and personalized medicine approaches for liver diseases. Additionally, the development of advanced computational tools and algorithms will be crucial for the analysis and interpretation of large-scale scRNA-seq datasets, enabling the identification of rare cell populations and complex cellular states.",
        "Developing effective therapies for liver disease comes with various challenges. There is a gap between animal models and clinical studies when it comes to understanding liver regeneration and translating that knowledge into therapeutic benefit. Animal models have been valuable in uncovering the mechanisms of liver regeneration, the signaling pathways involved, the timing of the regenerative response, and the cellular sources of regenerative cells. On the other hand, clinical studies in humans have focused more on observing clinical outcomes and identifying factors associated with the outcomes. Bridging the gap between preclinical studies and clinical translation is crucial. Conducting rigorous preclinical studies; utilizing humanized animal models, organoids, and bioengineered liver models to better mimic human liver physiology and disease; and developing robust translational strategies to accelerate the clinical translation of liver diseases and improve the predictability of clinical outcomes are some of the strategies that should be employed at a consensus level [16].",
        "Additionally, one of the primary challenges in developing therapies for liver disease is the complexity and heterogeneity of liver pathologies. Different liver diseases can arise from various etiologies, and each disease presents unique pathological features. For example, various approaches have been proposed to target NASH pathogenesis. These include modulating inflammation, enhancing fatty acid metabolism, inhibiting de novo lipogenesis, preventing hepatocyte injury, and investigating antifibrotic therapies [95]. Drugs targeting fibroblast growth factor (FGF) analogs, nuclear receptors (PPARs and FXR), thyromimetics (synthetic analogs of thyroid hormones with tissue-specific thyroid hormone actions), ASK1 inhibitors, caspase inhibitors, and CCR2/5 antagonists have been explored. However, treating NASH has proven to be challenging, as many agents in clinical trials have failed to meet their primary endpoints.",
        "Various drugs targeting different pathways, such as PPAR agonists (elafibrinor and seladelpar), FGF analogs (aldafermin and pegbelfermin), apoptosis inhibitors (selonsertib and emricasan), and the CCR2/CCR5 inhibitor cenicriviroc, did not achieve the desired outcomes in terms of NASH resolution, fibrosis improvement, or hepatic fat reduction [96,97,98]. These results were observed in phase IIb and III trials and highlight the difficulties in developing effective therapies. Nevertheless, new molecules continue to be tested in clinical trials, and different approaches have emerged, such as the use of combination therapy.",
        "Combining monotherapies with distinct mechanisms of action that act synergistically and target multiple pathways simultaneously might be more effective in circumventing compensatory mechanisms or cross-reactivity. Combination therapies involving different agents, such as FXR-agonists, CCR2/5 inhibitors, antidiabetic agents, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitors, are currently being investigated in phase II trials [95].",
        "One such combination involves cilofexor, an FXR agonist, and firsocostat, an ACC inhibitor, which has demonstrated promising results in reducing liver fat and improving liver enzymes in NASH patients (https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02781584, accessed on 19 July 2023). Additionally, combination therapies involving antidiabetic drugs, such as GLP-1 agonists (https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03987074, accessed on 19 July 2023) and SGLT2 inhibitors (https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04065841, accessed on 19 July 2023), are being investigated for their potential to enhance outcomes related to both liver health and diabetes. Combination therapy may also help in mitigating side effects associated with individual drugs, such as the use of statins to mitigate LDL cholesterol increase caused by FXR agonists (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02633956, accessed on 19 July 2023).",
        "Despite the advancements, selecting the right therapeutic target and the right combination of drugs is crucial. scRNA-seq has shown that different subsets of immune cells have different functions in NASH, indicating that neutralizing or inhibiting entire cell types may not be suitable. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of NASH can aid in the development of more targeted therapies. Liver fibrosis can develop as a consequence of advanced NASH. Currently, there is no standard therapy for liver fibrosis, and early detection is challenging. Activated HSCs play a crucial role in liver fibrogenesis, and targeting these cells is important for effective treatment. Various protein markers, such as type VI collagen receptor, retinol-binding protein receptor, PDGFR, and others, have been identified to be overexpressed in activated HSCs. However, delivering therapeutic agents to activated HSCs remains challenging due to their low abundance and barriers in the fibrotic liver [3].",
        "Efforts have been made to develop targeted and enhanced delivery systems, including small molecules, antibodies, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Researchers are also exploring affinity selection technologies to discover peptide- or antibody-based ligands with higher affinity and flexibility for chemical modifications [99]. These ligands, which can be artificially designed, have several advantages. They are small in size, making them easier to produce, and they do not elicit an immune response. Peptides and aptamers are examples of such ligands that can be used in targeted delivery systems [99]. Recently Vitamin A-coupled LNP (https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02227459, accessed on 19 July 2023) has been utilized for moderate to extensive hepatic fibrosis. Incorporating HSC-specific ligands into antifibrotic agents has the potential to significantly improve the success rate of clinical studies.",
        "Developing technologies such as cell therapy or oligonucleotide-based therapy may hold potential for treating liver diseases. As highlighted earlier, cell therapy using stem cells has emerged as a promising alternative for the treatment of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, with MSCs being the most commonly used cell type. MSCs derived from different tissues, such as bone marrow and umbilical cord, have been investigated, and bone-marrow-derived MSCs have shown superior improvement in liver function parameters compared to umbilical cord-derived MSCs [100]. However, in cell therapy clinical trials, the number of cells, the route of administration, and the cell type are crucial considerations. Additionally, the cell count used in treatment depends on factors such as patient weight, clinical condition, and administration route [100]. The route of administration often involves infusing the stem cells via the hepatic artery to enhance engraftment. Safety and efficacy are equally crucial, and although clinical trials have demonstrated improvements in liver function parameters without significant adverse effects, further research and larger-scale studies are needed to optimize cell therapy protocols and fully understand the long-term effects of stem-cell-based therapies for liver diseases.",
        "In addition, cell-free therapy utilizing secreted factors and EVs by MSCs is an emerging strategy that avoids potential risks associated with cell transplantation, such as tumorigenicity and embolism [100]. However, the standardized extraction of large quantities of EVs and exosomes from stem cells remains a challenge, and their optimal dosage and half-life are not well-defined. Therefore, clinical trials involving stem-cell-derived EVs for the treatment of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are still limited.",
        "While there have been significant advancements in oligonucleotide-based therapies for liver diseases, challenges remain in the safe and effective intracellular delivery of these compounds as well as their intracellular processing. One of the challenges in siRNA delivery is the efficient release of siRNAs from endosomes/lysosomes upon cellular internalization. Currently, only a small fraction of internalized siRNAs escapes the endosomal/lysosomal system, highlighting the need for alternative strategies to enhance their release [101]. While LNPs have been successful in liver and solid tumor targeting, their size limits their extravasation from the bloodstream, potentially restricting their use in other diseases [102]. Other concerns with LNPs include the need for intravenous administration and the potential toxicity of excipients. Nevertheless, the progress in oligonucleotide therapies, both in preclinical and clinical stages, has paved the way for innovative therapies. Despite the challenges, the exploration of siRNA drugs beyond the liver and the potential of siRNA combinations or other non-coding RNAs are areas that offer considerable opportunity.",
        "In conclusion, developing effective therapies for liver disease is a complex and multifaceted endeavor. Addressing the challenges associated with disease heterogeneity, impaired liver regeneration, and lack of specific biomarkers is critical. Advancements in precision medicine and personalized therapy based on genomic and transcriptomic data integration offer opportunities in the treatment of liver diseases. By considering individual patient characteristics, including genetic variations and biomarkers, treatments can be tailored to achieve better outcomes. Through collaborative efforts and leveraging emerging technologies, we can make significant strides towards combating liver diseases and improving the lives of millions of individuals affected by these conditions.",

        "Healthy mammalian liver tissue possesses remarkable regenerative capacity following injury. After hepatectomy or acute toxic injury, liver cells (mainly hepatocytes) in the resting phase will re-enter the cell cycle to proliferate, generating new liver cells, which is able to restore full liver quality and function in less than two weeks [1]. However, the regenerative capacity of liver is significantly weakened in tissues with lipid metabolism disorders, such as alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty liver and aging liver [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]. As a result, the liver is unable to fully restore the number of cells and normal function after liver injury. This promotes the development of end-stage liver diseases like fibrosis and cirrhosis [8]. In addition, in clinical liver transplantation, donor livers with abnormal lipid metabolism (such as fatty liver) sometimes cannot proliferate adequately in the recipient, resulting in “small-for-size syndrome” and transplantation failure [[9], [10], [11]].",
        "It is widely acknowledged that maintaining hepatic lipid homeostasis is critical for preserving the liver's regenerative capacity. During liver regeneration, hepatic lipid accumulation peaks 12–24 hours after 70% partial hepatectomy [[12], [13], [14]]. Triglyceride content can reach up to three to four times the pre-surgery level, gradually decreasing to basal levels by 72 hours post-surgery. Several studies have demonstrated that impaired liver regenerative capacity can result from disruptions in lipid accumulation [2,[15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. However, the mechanisms through which lipid homeostasis regulates liver regeneration and the reasons behind the decreased regenerative potential in livers with lipid metabolism disorders remain unclear.",
        "In a recent study published in Nature Communications, Chen et al. discovered that the transient accumulation of liver lipids during liver regeneration serves as a signal for regeneration and repair, promoting liver cell proliferation [20]. The researchers constructed an in vivo large-scale CRISPR screening platform for liver regeneration to identify potential key regulators. They found that Mier1 is a key regulator during liver regeneration. Mier1 encodes the mesoderm induction early response protein 1, which was previously identified as a transcriptional repressor via the recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 and 2 [21,22]. However, there have been limited functional studies of MIER1 in the liver or liver regeneration. Through 70% partial hepatectomy experiments, researchers found that MIER1, as an epigenetic regulator, plays an epigenetic “brake” role during liver regeneration. MIER1 binds to a large number of transcriptional initiation regions of genes related to cell proliferation and inhibits their expression. Knocking out MIER1 can significantly promote chromatin remodeling, increase the expression of cell proliferation-related genes, and enhance liver regeneration.",
        "The researchers also discovered a transient downregulation of MIER1 protein levels after hepatectomy, suggesting a dynamic regulatory mechanism of MIER1 during liver regeneration. Further studies revealed that MIER1 responds to acute lipid accumulation during liver regeneration, performing an important epigenetic regulatory function by modulating the protein levels of MIER1. Acute liver lipid accumulation induces a transient stress response in hepatocytes, resulting in the acute inhibition of the ribosomal translation process, thereby affecting MIER1 translation and causing dynamic downregulation of MIER1. This downregulation of MIER1 further promotes chromatin opening, cell cycle gene expression and liver regeneration. Interestingly, this physiological regulatory process is significantly impaired in aging and high-fat diet-induced fatty livers, resulting in a consistently high expression status of MIER1, which continuously suppresses cell cycle gene expression. Knocking out MIER1 can recover the regeneration capacity of aging and fatty livers.",
        "In summary, this study introduced a novel in vivo screening strategy, revealed an interesting underlying mechanism by which lipid homeostasis regulates liver regeneration, and identified the epigenetic factor MIER1 as a key “bridge” factor in mediating the transition from lipid signals to repair and regeneration capacity (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Lipid acute accumulation after hepatectomy promotes cell cycle gene expression and liver regeneration via regulating the epigenetic factor MIER1.Fig. 1",

        "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a small glycoprotein composed of 184 amino acids. Its molecular weight is 21–28 kDa with a four-helix bundle structure, the characteristic of the IL-6 cytokine family [1]. IL-6 is considered as a pleiotropic cytokine for its multiple physio-pathologic functions. Under normal conditions, the levels of IL-6 in the blood and interstitial fluid are extremely low. During aging, inflammation, or other pathological conditions, especially in the liver, IL-6 levels are significantly increased and are crucial for the progression of inflammation, fibrosis and carcinogenesis [1, 2]. However, the deletion of il6 gene also impairs the hepatocyte homeostasis and liver regeneration [3–5]. Understanding the roles and underlying mechanisms of IL-6 in liver physiological and pathological processes is still an ongoing process, and is critical to the development of therapeutic strategies for liver diseases.",
        "The effector signaling of IL-6 contains three modes (Fig. 1) [6]. IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) is a specialized receptor for IL-6, which is located on the membrane of a set of cell types, such as hepatocytes, immune cells, and some endothelial cells. In addition to IL-6R, IL-6 effector signaling needs another receptor component, 130-kD glycoprotein (gp130) protein. The first signal mode is called classic signaling, also named cis-signaling. The conserved site I of IL-6 cytokine first binds to the membrane bound IL-6R, and then the conserved sites II and III of IL-6 acquire the capability to interact with gp130 and form the complex (Fig. 1) [2], which leads to the dimerization and activation of gp130. The association between the conserved site I of IL-6 and IL-6R is indispensable, as the conserved sites II and III of IL-6 alone are not able to bind gp130 receptor and initiate its dimerization. The second signal mode is IL-6 trans-signaling, for that IL-6 conserved site I first binds a soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R), and then conserved sites II and III bind gp130 on a nearby cell to induce its dimerization and activation (Fig. 1) [7]. For the soluble IL-6 receptor, it is from the membrane bound IL-6R, which is cleaved at the cell surface by A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease17 (ADAM17) and released to tissue interstitial fluid and blood [8]. The third signal mode is cluster signaling. In this mode, IL-6 conserved site I binds a membrane bound IL-6R in A cell, and then the conserved sites II and III within IL-6/IL-6R complex bind gp130 located on the membrane of B cell. The A cell operates as a transmitter cell to activate gp130 downstream signaling of B cell, which is recently described in the dendritic cells (DCs)-mediated activation of IL-6 effector signaling in T cells (Fig. 1) [9, 10]. Collectively, IL-6 trans-signaling and cluster signaling modes can occur in the cells which only express gp130 but not IL-6R, thus amplifying the spectrum of target cells in response to IL-6.",

SOCS3 is a direct target of STAT3 and provides negative feedback to suppress JAK-STAT3 signaling",
        "Upon the formation of IL-6, IL-6R, and dimerized gp130 complex, the intracellular domain of gp130 is phosphorylated. The phosphorylated gp130 then recruits the downstream signal transducers, resulting in the activation of several signaling pathways (Fig. 1) [2, 11]. Janus kinase (JAK)-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) signaling is the well-established cascade downstream of activated gp130. STAT1 and STAT3 are phosphorylated by JAKs and then form active dimers (homo- and hetero-dimers), which translocate into the nucleus to induce the transcription of IL-6 target genes [12]. The activated gp130 also recruits Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), leading to the activation of downstream extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. Additionally, YES-associated protein 1 (YAP) and Src family kinase (SRC) are activated by phosphorylated gp130, resulting in YAP phosphorylation and nuclear translocation to initiate downstream transcription [13]. Furthermore, the activation of IL-6 effector signaling can also lead to a negative feedback regulatory system. For example, the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is induced by the activated STAT3, and then binds the phosphorylated domains of gp130 and JAKs to induce their degradation [14]. Based on the three signal modes to activate gp130 and a set of downstream signaling cascades, IL-6 performs its multifaceted functions in tissue homeostasis, regeneration, aging, and inflammation, thus playing critical roles in the physiological and pathological processes.",
        "The liver possesses remarkable regeneration capacity under injury conditions. The critical role of the IL-6/IL-6R/gp130-JAK-STAT3 axis has been well-established in the initiation phase of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (Fig. 2) [15, 16]. IL-6 is rapidly produced by Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy, contributing to the following hepatocyte proliferation and parenchyma restoration. The IL-6-promoted liver regeneration was determined in IL-6 knockout mice, as the deletion of il6 impaired the compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes by reducing the downstream STAT3 activation [3, 4], thus promoting liver failure, which could be corrected by the treatment of IL-6. This phenomenon and conclusion have been confirmed in hepatocyte-specific gp130-knockout, hepatocyte-specific STAT3-knockout, or IL-6R deficient mice [17–19]. IL-6 can also activate PI3K/AKT and YAP/Notch pathways independent of the STAT3 pathway to promote hepatocyte compensatory proliferation and liver regeneration [13, 20]. On the other side, the deletion of the negative regulator SOCS3 in hepatocytes resulted in the increased compensatory proliferation and more rapid restoration of liver mass following partial hepatectomy [21]. In addition, except produced by hepatocytes, IL-6 is also produced by myeloid cells, both of them are necessary to restore the number of liver-resident Kupffer cells to maintain tissue homeostasis during liver regeneration [22]. Other sources, including systemic IL-6 or skeletal muscle-derived IL-6, move into the liver and activate its effector signaling to trigger the autophagic flux in hepatocytes, which then contributes to liver regeneration [23, 24].",
        "Fig. 2The role of IL-6 signaling in liver homeostasis and regeneration. IL-6 trans-signaling, not classic signaling, is more important for its contribution to liver regeneration. IL-6 classic signaling is significant for the in vitro long-term expansion of hepatocytes and the in vivo reprogramming of hepatocytes into hepatic progenitor cells",
        "The role of IL-6 signaling in liver homeostasis and regeneration. IL-6 trans-signaling, not classic signaling, is more important for its contribution to liver regeneration. IL-6 classic signaling is significant for the in vitro long-term expansion of hepatocytes and the in vivo reprogramming of hepatocytes into hepatic progenitor cells",
        "Although the classic or cis-signaling of IL-6 is determined to promote the compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes, its trans-signaling in liver regeneration is more important [19, 25–27]. During liver regeneration after 70% hepatectomy, hyper-IL-6, which is a fusion protein of IL-6 and sIL-6R, induced a stronger and a much earlier hepatocyte regeneration effect [25]. Similarly, following D-gal-induced liver damage, the administration of hyper-IL-6 for the activation of IL-6 trans-signaling could rescue animals through an enhanced hepatocyte regeneration [26]. IL-6/sIL-6R double transgenic mice showed massive hepatocyte proliferation even without hepatectomy, whereas IL-6 single transgenic mice did not show such a phenotype [28]. Moreover, it is reported that IL-6 trans-signaling not just accelerate liver regeneration, it is indispensable for the regeneration of liver after partial hepatectomy [19]. This work demonstrated that, during liver regeneration after 70% hepatectomy, sIL-6R can be expressed by not only hepatocytes, but also neutrophils and macrophages, and sIL-6R-mediated IL-6 trans-signaling forms the long-term contribution of IL-6 effects for liver regeneration [19]. Moreover, IL-6 classic signaling is activated in the acute phase-response post liver infection, however, the expression of acute phase protein serum amyloid A2 is similar in wild-type and sIL-6R+/+ (loss of membrane IL-6R) mice, explaining that IL-6 trans-signaling can completely compensate for the loss of IL-6 classic signaling [19]. Indeed, hepatocytes express far more amounts of gp130 on the surface than IL-6R, and hyper-IL-6 thus can lead to a profound downstream effector signaling [5, 27, 29]. Since IL-6 is rapidly internalized whereas the IL-6/sIL-6R complex is not, the IL-6 trans-signal therefore acts much longer [28]. Thus, the clinic use of hyper-IL-6 would be more effective to promote liver regeneration in patients post partial liver resection.",
        "It is incontrovertible that hepatocytes have amazing proliferative capacity in liver regeneration and IL-6 plays a critical role during this process [30]. However, hepatocytes are very difficult to culture or expand in vitro, greatly limiting their clinical application in the therapy of liver diseases. It is reported that IL-6/sIL-6R combined with hepatocyte growth factors (HGF) significantly promoted hepatocyte proliferation after partial hepatectomy [20]. Similarly, a recent study reported that IL-6, co-operated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and HGF, could promote the long-term expansion (> 30 passages in ~ 150 days with theoretical expansion of ~ 1035 times) of primary mouse hepatocytes in vitro (Fig. 2) [31], which may effectively resolve the limited application of hepatocyte transplantation in liver diseases due to a shortage of enough hepatocytes. In addition, liver progenitor cells are the alternative cell resource to repair the injured liver via their differentiation into hepatocytes [32]. Yet, the activation of liver progenitor cells during liver injury is somewhat restrained, leading to the insufficient contribution to the repairment of liver function. Recent studies suggest that IL-6 is highly expressed and secreted by liver-resident macrophages upon liver damage, and the produced IL-6, as a niche signal, binds the membrane IL-6R and gp130 of hepatocytes and then activates the downstream transcription factor STAT3. Phosphorylated STAT3 associates with the regulatory genomic regions of reprogramming- and progenitor-related genes, which in-turn reprograms the remaining hepatocytes into a progenitor-like state [32–35]. It is unexpected that a single IL-6 cytokine would possess the prominent ability to induce the highly efficient in vivo reprogramming of hepatocytes (Fig. 2). These findings also provide further evidences for that hyper-IL-6 is able to initiate the proliferation of liver progenitor cells in vivo to regenerate the impaired liver [36].",
        "Senescent cells are characterized by the expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [37, 38], which promotes the development of various chronic diseases. IL-6, one of the major SASP factors, also belongs to the pro-inflammatory cytokines [38]. In the serum of healthy adults, IL-6 is normally lower than 2 pg/mL or undetectable, while a gradual increment of serum IL-6 amounts with advancing ages (Fig. 3) [39, 40]. Moreover, numbers of studies support the potential correlation of IL-6 levels with aging and chronic morbidity [38, 41]. As the data shown in the cohort of end-stage liver diseases, elevated IL-6 levels were highly predictive for mortality. None of the patients with lower IL-6 level (< 5.3 pg/mL) died within one year, but more than half of aged patients died within one year under higher IL-6 level (> 11.6 pg/mL) [41]. When exposed to hepatic ischemia/reperfusion insult, aged liver with high IL-6 in the microenvironment aggravates liver injury such as the intrahepatic tissue damage and inflammation [42]. Moreover, activation of IL-6 effector signaling is positively correlated with age-related dysregulation of lipid metabolism, hepatitis, fibrosis, and xenobiotic detoxification [1, 43]. During the senescence of liver cells, including hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and stellate cells, IL-6 is produced and participate in the development of liver diseases, especially cancer carcinogenesis and progression [44, 45]. During carcinogenesis, senescence-related IL-6 activates gp130-STAT3 pathway using trans-signaling mode in hepatic progenitor cells or HCC progenitor cells to promote their proliferation, malignant transformation, and hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma carcinogenesis. On the other side, IL-6 expressed by senescent cells suppresses the proliferation of senescent hepatocytes, and the hepatic progenitor cells enter compensatory proliferation, thus further promoting hepatocarcinogenesis [44, 45]. Blocking IL-6 trans-signaling using soluble gp130 or clearing senescent cells using a senolytic agent, as well as the depletion of hepatic progenitor cells, result in a significant reduction of hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma tumors [44, 45]. As mentioned in the regeneration section, local IL-6 reprograms hepatocytes into hepatic progenitor cells via gp130-STAT3 pathway, and then promotes liver regeneration [33]. However, in chronic senescent conditions, IL-6 is produced by senescent cells to promote the over-proliferation of hepatic progenitor cells and contribute to hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma carcinogenesis. A recent study also found that hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) underwent senescence after partial hepatectomy, and elimination of these senescent HSCs impaired liver regeneration. The underlying mechanism was that senescent HSCs expressed and secreted IL-6, binding to membrane IL-6R of hepatocytes to stimulate liver regeneration by the STAT3 pathway and SRC/YAP signal activation [46]. In the aged liver, IL-6 can be expressed and secreted by all senescent liver cells, implying its multifaced actions in the development of age-related diseases (Fig. 3).",
        "Fig. 3The role of IL-6 in liver aging. IL-6 concentration in serum is positively- corrected with the increased aging. Increased IL-6 in the liver is mainly expressed and secreted by senescent cells including hepatocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells, leading to the development of aging-associated chronic liver diseases. On the other side, senescence-secreted high IL-6 can stimulate the reprogramming of cells by the paracrine signaling",

        "Interestingly, IL-6 also plays different roles in the activation of stem cells during aging. When in young mice upon damage, IL-6 is up-regulated and promotes the activation of gland’s stem cells in vivo and in vitro, which is determined in stem cell-derived organoids. However, local IL-6 level is elevated in the aging gland, which does not generate a pituitary stem cell activation but promotes inflammation [47]. Four transcriptional factors abbreviated as OSKM (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) are well-established to induce the dedifferentiation and cellular reprogramming in multiple tissues [48]. Actually, OSKM induces two opposite cellular fates, both reprogramming and senescence [49]. However, the OSKM-induced senescence also produces IL-6 to mediate the dedifferentiation and reprogramming, further suggesting the double-edged effects of IL-6 in rejuvenation and aging (Fig. 3) [50].",
        "IL-6 signal, also considered as a double-edged sword, performs both pro-inflammatory and anti-proinflammatory roles in the pathogenesis of liver diseases (Fig. 4). During inflammation, the hepatic IL-6 levels can be increased to more than 100 ng/mL [51]. For its pro-inflammatory effect, IL-6 classic signaling especially hepatocyte-specific gp130 activation is crucial for the induction of the acute phase proteins in the liver during host response to the infectious insults [52, 53], and this pro-inflammatory circumstance is quickly resolved when the infection is controlled. If repeated or chronic hepatic IL-6 inflammatory insults are raised, a set of liver diseases will be initiated. Many studies have highlighted that chronic exposure to IL-6 impaired hepatic lipid metabolism [54–56]. In the humanized liver mouse model, the inflammatory effect of IL-6/GP130 pathway promoted hepatic lipid accumulation, suggesting the therapeutic potential of antagonizing GP130 signaling in the treatment of liver steatosis [57]. A recent study used hPSC-derived liver culture to mimic genetic variant-derived NAFLD, and found that IL-6 expression and IL-6/STAT3 activity was elevated during NAFLD development. The dampening of IL-6/STAT3 activity could alleviate the genetic variant-mediated susceptibility to NAFLD [58]. In a mouse model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), knockout of IL-6 or IL-6R also reduced the signs of inflammation during NASH progression [59]. In severe COVID-19 patients, high level of IL-6 was produced in lung and acted on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells by IL-6 trans-signaling, inducing liver inflammation and even liver injury [60]. In the event of hepatocarcinogenesis and progression, increased serum IL-6 level and activated IL-6/STAT3 signaling is highly associated with early tumor recurrence and poor prognosis of HCC patients [61]. For example, inhibition of IL-6 signaling dramatically impedes tumorigenesis and extends the tumor-free survival of patients following surgical partial hepatectomy [62]. Indeed, IL-6 or gp130 knockout mice developed significantly less tumors in the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC model and prolonged survival [63, 64], and we found that the HCC progenitors HcPCs not only autocrined IL-6, but also with promoted responses to IL-6, for their malignant progression to established HCC [65, 66]. In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), IL-6 increases the expression of circRNA GGNBP2 to encode the protein cGGNBP2-184aa, which in turn forms a positive feedback loop of IL-6/cGGNBP2-184aa/STAT3 to facilitate ICC progression [67]. In addition, HCC-derived fibroblasts can secrete IL-6 and bind adjacent HCC cells to activate IL-6/IL-6R/STAT3 axis, which facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells and accelerated HCC development [68]. Moreover, increased IL-6 signal with impaired degradation of IL-6 cytokine family signal transducers promotes the proliferation and migration of HCC cells [69]. IL-6 also activates hepatocytes to produce serum amyloid A1 and A2, and forms the pro-metastatic niche to help the metastasis of pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells into the liver [70]. In addition, evidences suggest that IL-6 trans-signaling, but not IL-6 classic signaling, is essential to promote HCC carcinogenesis and progression, and only the activation of membrane-bound IL-6R and gp130 in hepatocytes seems not sufficient for tumor formation [71, 72]. Only the specific inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling, rather than total inhibition of IL-6 signaling, is sufficient to suppress tumor progression [71, 72]. Together, the pro-inflammatory roles of IL-6 promotes the progression of chronic liver diseases, such as NAFLD, NASH, and HCC.",
        "Fig. 4The pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of IL-6 in the liver pathological process. The overexpression of IL-6 induced by liver injury presents a double-edged sword effect on the hepatic pathological process. Its pro-inflammatory effect promotes liver steatosis, fibrosis, endothelial cells (ECs) proliferation, and HCC development. On the other side, liver injury or chronic hepatitis are promoted in IL-6 or STAT3 knockout mice, suggesting the anti-inflammatory effect of IL-6. Moreover, IL-6 secreted by liver stroma cells can induce the differentiation of recruited monocytes towards tissue-resident Kupffer cells, but away from SAMs, so as to limit hepatic inflammation",

        "For the anti-inflammatory effect of IL-6, a set of studies in animal models involving chronic hepatitis demonstrate that IL-6 signaling is crucial for ameliorating liver injury and fibrosis. For example, Il6−/− mice developed mature-onset obesity and decreased glucose tolerance, which was partly reversed by IL-6 replacement at low doses [73]. In the mdr2−/− mouse model, the deletion of il6 gene or blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling by the soluble gp130 form exacerbated hepatic steatosis, inflammation, chronic hepatitis, and hepatocarcinogenesis, suggesting the protective role of IL-6 signaling [74]. IL-6 trans-signaling has also been found to have protective roles on acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury in the mice model [75]. It is also reported that high-fat diet (HFD) caused more body-weight gain in il6−/− mice than in wild-type mice [59]. HFD also exaggerated insulin resistance and deterioration of glucose homeostasis in Il6raΔmyel mice, with the underlying mechanism that specific inhibition of IL-6R expression resulted in M1 macrophage polarization and inflammation [76]. For macrophages in the liver, they are divided into the liver-resident Kupffer cells and monocyte-infiltrated macrophages. Tissue resident Kupffer cells’ main function is to maintain homeostasis. Monocyte-infiltrated macrophages are from the differentiation of recruited monocytes when exposed to liver injury [77]. In recent studies, it was found that human liver stromal cells produced and secreted IL-6 cytokine, contributing to the skewing differentiation of monocytes towards tissue-resident Kupffer cells but away from scar-associated macrophages (SAMs) (Fig. 4). Additionally, local IL-6 level is decreased in early-stage human liver diseases as compared to healthy liver tissues, suggesting a protective role for local IL-6 in the healthy liver [78].",
        "As IL-6 classic and trans-signaling are involved in the development of various diseases, several strategies have been used to inhibit IL-6 effector signaling at different levels in the pre-clinical and clinical settings (Fig. 5; Table 1) [1, 2, 79]. Neutralization of IL-6 inhibits both classic and trans-signaling, and targeting IL-6R blocks all the three modes of IL-6 effects. Moreover, the use of sgp130Fc, targeting IL-6 and sIL-6R complex, selectively suppresses the trans-signaling of IL-6. As IL-6 classic signaling plays crucial roles in the initiation of inflammation and the host defense against pathogen infection, global blockade of IL-6 signaling may reduce the induction of hepatic acute-phase proteins upon infection, such as Listeria monocytogenes [79]. However, the specific blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling using the recombinant sgp130Fc did not interfere with its functions in the defense against pathogens [80].",

        "IL-6 effects can be blocked by a set of antibodies and small molecules, including clazakizumab, sirukumab, olokizumab, and PF-04236921. Clazakizumab and siltuximab directly target the site I of IL-6 for interfering the formation of IL-6 and IL-6R complex, and have been approved for the effectiveness in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Castleman’s disease in clinical trials [81, 82]. Olokizumab binds to the site III of IL-6, disrupting the recruitment of high-affinity gp130 receptor with IL-6 and IL-6R complex, is also reported to be effective in treating RA patients [83]. Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is determined to bind to the IL-6 binding site of both membrane and soluble IL-6R, thus blocking classic, trans-, as well as cluster signaling [84, 85]. A series of clinical trials have demonstrated the therapeutic benefit of tocilizumab in chronic inflammatory diseases [86–88]. Indeed, treatment using tocilizumab resulted in the marked reductions of lymphadenopathy and inflammatory parameters in Castleman’s disease [89]. Moreover, fibrosis was also strikingly alleviated after tocilizumab injection in lung complications of systemic sclerosis [90]. Recently, a smart nanosystem of palladium nanoplates loaded with tocilizumab can selectively block IL-6R in the liver, ameliorating anemia with hepcidin production and suppressing cancer progression [91]. Moreover, other IL-6R-blocking antibodies, such as sarilumab and satralizumab, have therapeutic effects on COVID-19, RA, and neuromyelitis optica in phase III studies (Table 1). Soluble gp130Fc, named olamkicept or TJ301, is consists of two soluble human gp130 proteins fused with the Fc of human IgG, and selectively targets the IL-6-sIL-6R complex [79]. As neither IL-6 nor sIL-6R alone can bind to gp130, this sgp130Fc is a selective inhibitor of IL-6 trans-signaling without interfering the classic signaling. Olamkicept has exhibited promising results in the clinical trials [73, 92, 93]. For example, a phase IIa open label trial evaluating olamkicept in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) showed that over 20% patients treated with olamkicept were completely alleviated in clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers [93]. Sgp130Fc treatment in HFD-fed mice presented reduced macrophage accumulation in the adipose tissue, resulting in the improved insulin resistance [94]. Furthermore, sgp130Fc administration, but not anti-IL-6, is more likely to improve the survival in the mice models of cecal ligation and puncture, abdominal aortic aneurysms, and acute lung injury [95–97]. In addition, in a mouse model that mimics human NASH-driven HCC, treatment of olamkicept can significantly regress NASH and markedly reduce NASH-driven HCC [98].",
        "IL-6 binding to IL-6R and gp130 results in the activation of intercellular signal transducers including the phosphorylation of JAK, Src, and STAT3. Therefore, these intercellular signal transducers inhibitors can lead to a global blockade of IL-6 signaling. The clinical trials with JAK/STAT inhibitors are underway for the therapy of cancers and inflammatory diseases (Fig. 5) [12, 99]. For example, ruxolitinib, targeting both JAK1 and JAK2 kinases for inhibiting their phosphorylation, was first approved by the FDA in 2011 for the treatment of myelofibrosis [100, 101]. Tofacitinib, competing with the adenosine triphosphate binding site of both JAK1 and JAK3 for blocking their phosphorylation, was first approved by the FDA in 2012 for the treatment of RA [102]. As reported in COVID-19 patients, both sgp130Fc and JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib can block IL-6 trans-signaling with decreased phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT1/3, resulting in the inhibition of proinflammatory factors production and the alleviation of liver injury [60]. Ruxolitinib also effectively inhibits the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in HCC cells and significantly reduces their proliferation and colony formation [103]. Importantly, evidences from a set of clinical trials showed that the selective JAK1 inhibitors, such as filgotinib and upadacitinib, are more effective than the pan-JAK inhibitor of tofacitinib in the treatment of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis [104–106]. Data from a phase II trial showed that 47% of the Crohn’s disease patients treated with filgotinib achieved the clinical remission compared with 23% in the tofacitinib group [107]. Itacitinib, another JAK1 selective inhibitor, has been investigated in a phase I study of advanced HCC [108]. OPB-31,121, as a STAT3 antagonist targeting its SH2 region, is an orally bioavailable low-molecular-weight compound, and the clinical trial of this drug was conducted in HCC patients [109].",
        "Although the therapeutic effect of intervening IL-6 signaling can be achieved by various inhibitors, ranging from blocking the IL-6 cytokine or its receptor outside of the cell to targeting the kinases and transcription factors inside of the cell, evidences from animal models and pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of IL-6 effects also induced adverse effects, thus limiting its use in the clinics in any case [79]. Blocking IL-6 in IBD resulted in severe adverse effects, such as abdominal pain, rather than just ameliorating intestinal inflammation [110]. This problem may be due to the diverse biological effects of the global inhibition of IL-6, and the selective targeting of IL-6 or its downstream effectors may be more important. To date, as evidences from animal models have demonstrated the primary role of IL-6 trans-signaling in inflammatory diseases, olamkicept, selectively targeting sIL-6R but not IL-6 or IL-6R, can effectively discriminate between IL-6 classic and trans-signaling, thus may be more beneficial than the global blockade of IL-6 [111, 112]. Hence, olamkicept, or the developing next-generation selective inhibitors of IL-6 trans-signaling, are considered to be a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for further clinical studies.",
        "IL-6 is a well investigated pleiotropic cytokine with three different signal modes. Membrane IL-6R are mainly expressed in hepatocytes, immune cells, and some endothelial cells, leading to the limit of IL-6 classic signaling. However, the gp130 protein is widely expressed in tissues [78], representing the extensive responses to IL-6 via the trans-signaling activated by IL-6/sIL-6R/gp130 complex. Recently, accumulated evidences have suggested the more important effect of IL-6 trans-signaling on liver regeneration and pathological processes. Selective inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling rather than the global blockade of IL-6 might therefore be more effective in the treatment of liver pathologies. Interestingly, HHV-8 encodes a viral homolog of human IL-6, called viral IL-6 (vIL-6) [113]. vIL-6, in contrast to hIL-6, can directly bind to and activate gp130 without the need of hIL-6R. With the activation of downstream signaling cascades, vIL-6 can further increase the production of endogenous IL-6 and enhance the acute-phase responses [114, 115].",
        "It is also generally accepted that IL-6 is a double-edged sword factor for its differential functions in hepatic regeneration, aging, and chronic liver diseases. Under physiological conditions, IL-6 signal is critical for liver regeneration and the proliferation of hepatocytes as to its pro-regenerative effect. During aging progression, the IL-6 level was gradually increased, which enhances its pro-inflammatory effects and even promotes the development of inflammation-associated liver diseases. However, on the other side, high IL-6 level produced by senescent cells can also lead to the reprogramming of hepatocytes, and performs its protective effect on the development of liver diseases with anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, in order to more accurately intervene the IL-6-mediated liver diseases or aging, it is of prior importance to understand when, where, and how IL-6 works in the physiological and pathological processes in the liver.",

    "title": "LXR signaling controls homeostatic dendritic cell maturation. the context in which an antigen is perceived, preserving the balance between immunity and tolerance. Whereas the pathways driving immunogenic maturation in response to infectious insults are well-characterized, the signals that drive tolerogenic maturation during homeostasis are still poorly understood. We found that the engulfment of apoptotic cells triggered homeostatic maturation of type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s) within the spleen. This maturation process could be mimicked by engulfment of empty, nonadjuvanted lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), was marked by intracellular accumulation of cholesterol, and was highly specific to cDC1s. Engulfment of either apoptotic cells or cholesterol-rich LNPs led to the activation of the liver X receptor (LXR) pathway, which promotes the efflux of cellular cholesterol, and repressed genes associated with immunogenic maturation. In contrast, simultaneous engagement of TLR3 to mimic viral infection via administration of poly(I:C)-adjuvanted LNPs repressed the LXR pathway, thus delaying cellular cholesterol efflux and inducing genes that promote T cell-mediated immunity. These data demonstrate that conserved cellular cholesterol efflux pathways are differentially regulated in tolerogenic versus immunogenic cDC1s and suggest that administration of nonadjuvanted cholesterol-rich LNPs may be an approach for inducing tolerogenic DC maturation.

        "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and deadly malignancies worldwide [1, 2]. According to the 2025 cancer statistics, it is projected that there will be approximately 154,270 new cases of CRC and around 52,900 CRC‐related deaths in the United States [3]. A combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors, including diet, influences the development of CRC [4, 5, 6]. High dietary cholesterol intake, in particular, has been connected to a greater likelihood of developing cancer and might impact the survival of those with cancer [7, 8]. Notably, studies suggest that there is a correlation between increased serum cholesterol levels and a greater risk of CRC [9]. However, the precise relationship between cholesterol and CRC, as well as the underlying mechanisms, remains incompletely understood.",
        "Cholesterol, a vital component of mammalian cell membranes, plays a crucial role in maintaining membrane integrity and fluidity [10, 11]. Its metabolism is tightly regulated through procedures such as biosynthesis, assimilation, release and conversion [12, 13]. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that high‐fat diets and hypercholesterolaemia contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression by activating metabolic pathways like the Hedgehog pathway and mTORC1 [14, 15, 16]. Cholesterol and its byproducts function as signalling agents that drive tumour progression, including in CRC [17, 18, 19].",
        "Aberrant cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells alters the tumour microenvironment (TME), promoting tumour progression and impairing treatment efficacy [20, 21, 22]. Cholesterol metabolism also influences tumour‐infiltrating immune cells, modulating their anti‐tumour or pro‐tumour effects [23]. Recent progress in comprehending the relationship between cancer metabolism and the immune system has led to promising combination strategies targeting cholesterol metabolism to enhance immunotherapy. For example, inhibiting the cholesterol metabolism enzyme cholesterol‐25‐hydroxylase (CH25H) can reverse the immunosuppressive function of tumour‐associated macrophages (TAMs) and enhance T cell infiltration and activation, improving the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti‐PD‐1 antibodies [24]. Similarly, targeting Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9), a cholesterol metabolism regulator, through gene editing or neutralising antibodies, can increase MHC I expression on tumour cells, enhancing T cell‐mediated tumour killing [25].",
        "Despite these advances, current immunotherapy for CRC remains limited due to the complexity of the TME, tumour heterogeneity and immune escape mechanisms [26, 27, 28]. This review highlights the role of cholesterol metabolism in cancer immunity and explores the potential of targeting cholesterol metabolism to improve immunotherapy outcomes in CRC.",
        "Intracellular cholesterol homeostasis refers to the dynamic balance maintained by cells through finely tuned regulatory mechanisms, involving the synthesis, uptake, storage, utilisation and efflux of cholesterol [12]. This process is crucial for the integrity of cell membranes, signal transduction, hormone synthesis (such as steroid hormones) and lipid metabolism [29]. To better understand the mechanisms underlying cholesterol homeostasis, it is essential to introduce both the intracellular synthesis and the exogenous uptake of cholesterol (Figure 1) [17].",
        "The key biochemical process of cholesterol homeostasis in cells. This process encompasses the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol, the exogenous uptake of cholesterol, and the efflux of intracellular cholesterol. The graphic was created by Figdraw (www.figdraw.com).",
        "Cholesterol synthesis begins with acetyl‐CoA and proceeds through a series of enzymatic reactions that ultimately produce cholesterol. To initiate this process, the enzyme acetoacetyl‐CoA thiolase facilitates the condensation of two acetyl‐CoA molecules to create acetoacetyl‐CoA, which then interacts with an additional acetyl‐CoA molecule in the presence of HMG‐CoA synthase (HMGCS) to form 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl‐CoA (HMG‐CoA) [12]. Then, under the influence of HMG‐CoA reductase (HMGCR), HMG‐CoA is converted to mevalonate (MVL) through reduction by NADPH [30]. Subsequently, mevalonate undergoes a cascade of enzymatic transformations that sequentially yield 3‐isopentenyl pyrophosphate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, squalene and lanosterol, culminating in the biosynthesis of cholesterol [31]. Furthermore, through a series of reactions such as oxidation, demethylation and reduction, lanosterol is converted into cholesterol. These reactions involve various enzymes, including cytochrome P450 family enzymes and reductases [32].",
        "Additionally, exogenous cholesterol uptake refers to the process by which cells acquire cholesterol from the external environment, primarily through the uptake of low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) particles mediated by the LDL receptor (LDLR) [33]. Meanwhile, cholesterol efflux is mainly mediated through two pathways: ATP‐binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)‐mediated cholesterol efflux and ATP‐binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1)‐mediated cholesterol efflux [34, 35]. Moreover, the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol is tightly regulated by feedback mechanisms to ensure dynamic balance in cellular cholesterol levels. The regulation of HMGCR gene expression is mediated by Sterol Regulatory Element‐Binding Protein 2 (SREBP‐2) [36]. When cholesterol within the cell is scarce, SREBP‐2 is activated and migrates to the nucleus, enhancing the expression of HMGCR. In contrast, elevated cholesterol levels lead to the inhibition of SREBP‐2 activity. Finally, the activity of HMGCR is also regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation [12].",
        "In summary, cholesterol metabolism homeostasis is a highly regulated process involving multiple organelles and signalling pathways. Its dysregulation is linked to various diseases, positioning it as a crucial target for therapeutic and drug development efforts. By regulating cholesterol synthesis, uptake and efflux, intracellular cholesterol levels can be balanced, promoting overall metabolic health. Understanding these mechanisms offers valuable insights for developing therapeutic strategies for cholesterol‐related diseases. Additionally, this balance extends its influence to critical biological processes like tumour–immune interactions in cancer.",
        "Within the TME, cholesterol and its derivatives are important in determining whether immune cells exhibit anti‐tumour or tumour‐tolerant behaviours [17]. Thus, gaining a more profound insight into cholesterol metabolism in tumours could unveil new opportunities for immune sensitisation and therapeutic intervention. Now, we will touch on the roles of cholesterol metabolism in CRC via the regulation of immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells, natural killer (NK) cells, TAMs and MDSCs (Figure 2).",
        "The effects of cholesterol metabolism on immune cells in CRC TME. The graphic was created by Figdraw (www.figdraw.com).",
        "CD8+ T cells, known as cytotoxic T cells, have the ability to directly kill tumour cells by discharging perforin and granzymes [37]. Clinical studies have indicated that CD8+ T cells infiltrating at high levels within tumours are positively correlated with patient survival rates [38]. Importantly, the functional status of CD8+ T cells in CRC is controlled by numerous intricate factors, such as cholesterol metabolism (Figure 3).",
        "Roles of cholesterol homeostasis in modulating CD8+ T cell function in CRC. The graphic was created by Figdraw (www.figdraw.com).",
        "For patients with stage II/III CRC, there was a positive correlation between HDL cholesterol (HDL‐C) levels and the presence of CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and iNOS+ cells, which were associated with a favourable prognosis [39]. Additionally, cholesterol's immunosuppressive arsenal extends to ER stress—overload in CD8+ T cells activates X‐box binding protein 1 (XBP1), upregulating exhaustion markers (PD‐1, TIM‐3). Depleting cholesterol or alleviating ER stress restores anti‐tumour vigour [40, 41]. The research by Zhang et al. further indicated that administering \nLactobacillus plantarum\n L168 and its metabolite, indole‐3‐lactic acid (I3LA), mitigated intestinal inflammation, decreased colorectal tumour growth, and resolved gut dysbiosis. I3LA reduces the expression of Saa3, related to cholesterol metabolism in CD8+ T cells, through transcriptional inhibition and chromatin accessibility alteration, enhancing the performance of tumour‐infiltrating CD8+ T cells [42]. Additionally, glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), a prognostic marker associated with cholesterol metabolism, correlates with CD8+ T‐cell exhaustion in CRC by modulating cholesterol levels within CD8+ T cells [43]. Collectively, these studies suggest that cholesterol metabolism in CD8+ T cells significantly influences their function in CRC.",
        "Aberrant cholesterol metabolism in CRC cells exerts a significant influence on CD8+ T‐cell exhaustion and infiltration. ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a1 (ATP6V0A1) drives cholesterol uptake through RABGEF1‐dependent endosome maturation, generating 24‐hydroxycholesterol (24‐OHC) to activate LXR‐TGF‐β1 signalling. This cascade paralyses memory CD8+ T cells via SMAD3, a vulnerability that can be reversed by the repurposed antiviral drug daclatasvir [44]. Similarly, deletion of dual specificity phosphatase 18 (DUSP18) unleashes CD8+ T‐cell activity by blocking lanosterol‐mediated KRAS suppression, revealing a metabolic checkpoint in immune evasion [45]. These findings highlight how cholesterol intermediates act as molecular puppeteers, influencing both tumour and immune cells.",
        "Furthermore, mevalonate kinase (MVK), a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, dampens interferon responses in microsatellite instability (MSI) CRC by silencing Th1 chemokines such as CXCL9/10. Knockout of MVK reinvigorates CD8+ T‐cell infiltration [46], while the HMGCR inhibitor simvastatin disrupts PD‐L1 expression via inhibiting lncRNASNHG29/YAP axis, revitalising cytotoxic T lymphocytes [47].",
        "In summary, the regulation of CD8+ T cell activity in CRC is linked to cholesterol metabolism, with key genes such as ATP6V0A1 and DUSP18 modulating their function through cholesterol trafficking and signalling pathways. Therapeutic strategies targeting cholesterol metabolism, such as MVK gene knockout and HMGCR inhibitors like simvastatin, have demonstrated potential in reactivating CD8+ T cells and boosting anti‐tumour immune responses in CRC. However, despite these findings, the cholesterol metabolic network is highly complex, and there may be many unknown regulatory mechanisms at play. Current research may only be scratching the surface, revealing just the tip of the iceberg. To enhance our understanding of cholesterol metabolism's role in CD8+ T cell function, further investigation is necessary, along with the development of improved therapeutic strategies.",
        "In TME, CD4+ T cells exhibit a dual role in immune responses. On one hand, anti‐tumour responses can be enhanced by CD4+ T cells, including Th1 and Th17 cells, through the secretion of cytokines such as IFN‐γ and IL‐17, which activate the immune system. On the other hand, Tregs, a special subset of CD4+ T cells, may suppress anti‐tumour immune responses by secreting immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL‐10 and TGF‐β [48, 49]. Interestingly, recent research has underscored the crucial roles of cholesterol metabolism in controlling CD4+ T cell‐mediated immune responses in CRC, emphasising their potential use as targets in treatment.",
        "At the heart of this interplay lies the role of distal cholesterol precursors (DCPs), intermediates lingering between lanosterol and cholesterol. These metabolites bind RORγt, a nuclear receptor pivotal for Th17 cell differentiation, driving pro‐tumorigenic immune polarisation. In microsatellite‐stable (MSS) CRC tumours, dysregulated cholesterol biosynthesis fosters DCP accumulation, crafting a Th17‐skewed TME that fuels malignancy [50]. This metabolic imbalance transforms CRC cells into covert manipulators, secreting DCPs to co‐opt immune defences into allies of tumour progression. Beyond direct metabolic reprogramming, cholesterol exerts its treachery through iron hijacking. Lipocalin‐2 (LCN2), overexpressed in CRC, disrupts CD4+ T‐cell iron homeostasis by accelerating iron efflux, triggering apoptosis and fostering a tumour‐permissive niche. Paradoxically, LCN2 simultaneously amplifies cholesterol metabolism in infiltrating T cells, further empowering CRC invasion [51], illustrating how lipid networks orchestrate both metabolic and immune dysfunction.",
        "In sum, in the TME of CRC, the function of CD4+ T cells and the progression of CRC are affected by cholesterol metabolism, which regulates Th17 cell differentiation and iron metabolism, suggesting CD4+ T cells as possible therapeutic targets. However, many factors such as the complexity of the tumour microenvironment, unknown mechanisms of the cholesterol metabolic network, individual differences and tumour heterogeneity, challenges in clinical translation, and the complexity of multifactorial interactions may all limit a comprehensive understanding and effective utilisation of CD4+ T cell functions in CRC.",
        "Treg cells are critical for immune tolerance and exert immunosuppressive effects in the tumour microenvironment (TME), especially in colorectal cancer (CRC) [52, 53]. Targeting Treg cells in cancer therapy requires understanding their context‐dependent mechanisms. Metabolic reprogramming, including cholesterol metabolism, plays a key role in influencing Treg infiltration and function within the tumour microenvironment [54, 55]. In MC38 tumours, Treg cells show increased Pdcd1 expression, depending on SREBP activity linked to mevalonate metabolism‐driven protein geranylgeranylation. Blocking PD‐1 or SREBP signalling disrupts PI3K activation in intratumoural Treg cells [56]. Al‐Husein et al. found that statin treatment (HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors) increases Treg infiltration in CRC tumours [57].",
        "NK cells, key innate immune cells, are vital in the immune response against CRC [58, 59]. They directly lyse tumour cells by releasing cytotoxic granules, including perforin and granzymes, which induce apoptosis. Moreover, NK cells secrete cytokines like IFN‐γ to modulate immune responses and inhibit tumour progression [58, 59].",
        "Liu et al. developed a cholesterol (C)‐to‐NK cell ratio (CNR) biomarker, highlighting the combined impact of cholesterol metabolism and inflammation on CRC outcomes. Elevated tissue CNR levels indicate a higher CRC risk, while lower levels are linked to better survival rates [60]. Moreover, CRC‐infiltrating NK cells often show lower intracellular cholesterol than normal CD56+ NK cells. Cholesterol reduction in NK cells by CD16+ neutrophils may decrease their cytotoxicity [61]. These findings suggest cholesterol metabolism's importance in NK cell function and CRC progression.",
        "In the TME, immunosuppressive cells, such as TAMs and myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), collaborate to inhibit antitumour immune responses and promote tumour progression and metastasis through the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, metabolites and chemokines [62, 63]. Consequently, strategies targeting these immunosuppressive cells have emerged as significant avenues for tumour immunotherapy research. For instance, inhibiting the immunosuppressive functions of TAMs or depleting MDSCs has shown promise in enhancing antitumour immunity [62, 63].",
        "In CRC, a key factor in the modulation of TAMs and MDSCs is cholesterol metabolism. The cholesterol transporter SR‐B1 emerges as a dual‐faced architect of immune evasion. Knockdown of SR‐B1 in CRC models has been shown to reduce tumour burden by remodelling the TME. This involves reprogramming immunosuppressive cells (TAMs and MDSCs), modulating the expression of PD‐L1 and HLA‐B, and resetting cholesterol flux via LDLR and ABCA1 [64]. Strikingly, SR‐B1 silencing synergises with anti‐PD‐1 therapy, highlighting its combinatorial potential. 5‐Aza‐2′‐deoxycytidine (5Aza) functions as an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, regulating cholesterol buildup, p65 activation, and IL‐6 production by targeting ATP‐binding cassette transporter A9 (ABCA9). 5‐Aza causes primary mouse macrophages to polarise into an M1 phenotype, characterised by increased phosphorylated p65 and IL‐6 level, and suppresses CRC peritoneal carcinomatosis by modulating macrophage‐dependent T cell activation [65]. Meanwhile, research has demonstrated that the gut microbiota can utilise LDL‐C to rewire immune gene networks, bridging lipid metabolism and tumour progression [66]. This microbial‐metabolic axis underscores the complexity of CRC pathogenesis and suggests that targeting cholesterol metabolism and the gut microbiota may offer novel therapeutic strategies for CRC.",
        "Neutrophils, the most abundant type of white blood cells in the bloodstream, play a crucial role in the TME and exhibit a dual role in cancer dynamics, oscillating between pro‐tumour and anti‐tumour activities that significantly influence cancer progression [67]. Elevated neutrophil levels in CRC patients are associated with poor prognosis, and the neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio serves as an independent prognostic indicator [68]. Zhang et al. recently revealed that CRC tumour tissues specifically accumulate CD16+ neutrophils. These cells experience abnormal cholesterol accumulation due to CD16/TAK1/NF‐κB axis activation, which boosts scavenger receptors like CD36 and LRP1 for cholesterol intake. The region‐specific CD16+ neutrophils not only competitively inhibit NK cell cholesterol intake, disrupting lipid raft formation and antitumour signalling, but also release NETs to induce NK cell death [61].",
        "In conclusion, cholesterol metabolism actively influences immune cell interactions rather than being a passive participant in CRC. Notably, dendritic cells (DCs), heterogeneous antigen‐presenting cells with dendrite‐like projections, are vital for capturing, processing antigens, and presenting them to T cells to initiate specific immune responses [69, 70]. In CRC, DCs have a dual role: they can activate T cells and induce immunological memory to fight tumours, but also secrete cytokines affecting tumour cell growth, proliferation and angiogenesis [71]. Cholesterol mobilisation is essential for DC maturation and the cancer immunogenic response [72, 73]. However, the regulatory effects of cholesterol metabolism on DC functions in CRC are still unclear and require further investigation. As research continues to explore the complex relationship between lipid metabolism and immune function, CRC treatment may evolve into a more precise and powerful approach by combining metabolic targeting with immune enhancement. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes.",
        "The role of cholesterol metabolism has become crucial in the immune response and the progression of tumours in CRC [74]. This metabolic pathway is intricately linked to the pathogenesis of CRC through various mechanisms, including the regulation of cholesterol levels and the influence of lipid‐modulating agents [75]. Here, we reviewed the clinical significance of cholesterol metabolism in CRC (Table 1), underscoring its significance in cancer susceptibility, therapeutic outcomes, and as a possible therapeutic target.",
        "The clinical significance of cholesterol metabolism in CRC.",
        "To comprehend cholesterol metabolism's influence on CRC, it is essential to first examine how metabolic abnormalities contribute to cancer risk. A prospective study investigating the relationship between anthropometric and clinical measures linked to insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) and CRC in male smokers reported significant findings [76]. A significantly elevated risk of CRC, especially colon cancer, was observed in individuals with a BMI in the highest quintile compared to those in the lowest quintile. Furthermore, subjects presenting with a cluster of three IRS‐related conditions—hypertension, a BMI of ≥ 25 kg/m2 and an HDL‐C level below 40 mg/dL (1.55 mmol/L)—demonstrated a significantly higher risk of CRC compared to those with fewer such conditions [76].",
        "In addition to these findings, cholesterol metabolites, such as oxysterols, are associated with the CRC risk. For instance, research by Passarelli et al. revealed that higher circulating levels of 7α‐hydroxycholesterol (7‐OHC) were linked to a greater risk of colorectal adenomas, whereas increased levels of 4β‐hydroxycholesterol (4β‐OHC) were associated with a reduced risk [78]. Similarly, elevated plasma concentrations of 27‐hydroxycholesterol (27‐OHC) were considerably related to an increased likelihood of developing precursor lesions for CRC [79]. These outcomes point to the crucial role of cholesterol metabolites in CRC development and hint at potential biomarkers for early intervention and detection.",
        "Beyond metabolic metabolites, the expression and genetic variations of cholesterol metabolism‐associated genes can also impact CRC risk. The activities of lipid transfer proteins also play a crucial role in CRC development. Specifically, the functions of lipid transfer proteins, including lecithin: LCAT and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), influence the quantity and structural integrity of HDL particles. Research has shown that CRC patients exhibit increased CETP activity alongside decreased activities of LCAT and paraoxonase‐1 [77]. Preliminary analyses suggest that CETP mass may serve as a potential indicator for CRC development, highlighting that variations in HDL‐C levels and HDL structure could be involved in the carcinogenic process [77]. Furthermore, cholesterol 7α‐hydroxylase (CYP7A1) has been proposed as a genetic modifier of CRC risk and a potential target for the treatment with bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Wertheim et al. demonstrated that CYP7A1 polymorphisms influence faecal bile acid concentrations and serve as risk factors for colorectal adenoma development, with UDCA's preventive efficacy modulated by genetic variation in CYP7A1 [83].",
        "Genetic variations can also impact cholesterol metabolism and CRC risk. Caruso et al. explored the prognostic significance of LDLR in patients with colorectal carcinoma and found that patients lacking LDLR expression had notably shorter survival durations than those with LDLR expression [80]. Additionally, an important enzyme for cholesterol metabolite oxidation is α‐Methylacyl‐CoA racemase (AMACR), which is notably overexpressed in colorectal adenomas and cancer. A case–control study by Daugherty et al. identified specific AMACR polymorphisms associated with an elevated risk of advanced distal colorectal adenoma, underscoring the potential role of AMACR genetic variations in colorectal adenoma susceptibility [81].",
        "Given the significant role of cholesterol metabolism in CRC, targeting this pathway holds promise for therapeutic interventions. In fact, the clinical significance of cholesterol metabolism in CRC extends to its therapeutic potential. For instance, IL‐2 has been shown to induce a pronounced reduction in cholesterol levels, highlighting the potential influence of cytokines on metabolic pathways beyond their immunotherapeutic functions [82].",
        "Several clinical trials have explored the use of cholesterol‐modulating agents, such as statins, in combination therapies for CRC. Combination therapies involving statins have shown mixed results. A phase II study by Lee et al. demonstrated that combining simvastatin with conventional FOLFIRI chemotherapy in mCRC patients achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 46.9% and a disease control rate of 83.7%, with no additional adverse effects attributed to simvastatin therapy [84]. However, a randomised phase II trial found that adding simvastatin to XELIRI/FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimens failed to improve progression‐free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) for mCRC patients who had undergone previous treatments [85]. Similarly, a prospective cohort study revealed that for stage III colon cancer patients, statin use during and following adjuvant chemotherapy was not linked to enhanced disease‐free survival (DFS), recurrence‐free survival (RFS), or OS [86].",
        "In summary, cholesterol metabolism exerts a multifaceted role in CRC, influencing cancer risk, progression and therapeutic response. While genetic variations and lipid‐modulating agents offer potential therapeutic targets, clinical trials have shown mixed results regarding the efficacy of statins in CRC treatment. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interactions between cholesterol metabolism and CRC, ultimately leading to more effective therapeutic strategies.",
        "With its high incidence and mortality rates, CRC poses a significant challenge to global health [1, 2]. Recent research has stressed the critical role of cholesterol metabolism in CRC development, progression and immune interactions, offering new insights into potential therapeutic strategies [75, 87].",
        "Cholesterol metabolism is intricately linked to CRC through multiple pathways. Elevated cholesterol levels and dysregulated lipid metabolism have been shown to promote tumorigenesis and cancer progression [88]. Specifically, cholesterol and its byproducts can alter the tumour microenvironment by affecting immune cell activity, encouraging TAM polarisation, and hindering T‐cell responses [10, 17, 89]. For example, high cholesterol levels in tumour cells can inhibit antigen presentation, enrich immunosuppressive cells, and induce CD8+ T cell exhaustion [40, 90]. Additionally, cholesterol metabolites such as 27‐OHC have been shown to recruit neutrophils and γδ‐T cells, thereby suppressing antitumour immunity [91].",
        "The interaction between cholesterol metabolism and immune responses in CRC has led to the exploration of combination therapies targeting cholesterol pathways. For instance, inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes like MVK or using statins has shown promise in enhancing antitumour immunity [88]. These strategies aim to disrupt the immunosuppressive TME and improve the efficacy of existing immunotherapies. However, clinical trials targeting cholesterol metabolism in CRC have yielded mixed results. While some studies have demonstrated improved outcomes with combination therapies, others have shown limited efficacy. This variability underscores the complexity of the TME and the need for more targeted and personalised approaches.",
        "In the future outlook for cholesterol metabolism in CRC, several key areas should be prioritised. Elucidating molecular mechanisms is essential, as further studies are needed to fully understand how cholesterol metabolism influences CRC progression and immune evasion through specific metabolites and their interactions with immune cells. Personalised therapies should be developed to address the heterogeneity of CRC, targeting cholesterol metabolism based on individual patient characteristics such as genetic variations and tumour stage, while identifying biomarkers that predict response to these therapies. Combination strategies that integrate cholesterol metabolism inhibitors with existing treatments like chemotherapy and immunotherapy hold promise for enhancing efficacy, with preclinical and clinical studies exploring synergistic effects and optimal dosing regimens. The impact of diet and lifestyle on CRC risk and progression should also be investigated, with public health initiatives aimed at reducing high‐cholesterol diets potentially complementing medical interventions. Finally, understanding how cholesterol metabolism reshapes the TME and influences tumour‐stroma interactions could lead to novel therapeutic targets, with strategies disrupting cholesterol‐dependent TME remodelling enhancing the effectiveness of anti‐CRC therapies.",
        "In conclusion, cholesterol metabolism is a multifaceted driver of CRC progression and immune evasion. While current research has illuminated several potential therapeutic avenues, additional research is crucial to completely utilise the clinical potential of targeting cholesterol pathways in CRC. Future efforts should focus on unravelling the complex link between cholesterol metabolism and cancer biology, ultimately facilitating more individualised and successful treatment plans.",

        "Cellular quiescence, also referred to as G0, is a reversible non-proliferating state. Quiescent cells can be reactivated to exit from the quiescent state and reenter the actively cycling states (G1, S, G2, and M phases) in response to certain intrinsic or extrinsic signals. Increasing evidence indicates that quiescence is not a passive non-proliferating state but is rather an active metabolic state maintained by certain transcriptional programs (Roche et al., 2017; Yao, 2014). The switch from quiescence to proliferation is coupled with extensive changes in the transcriptional program coordinating metabolic and proliferation dynamics. The tightly orchestrated quiescence exit is crucial for tissue homeostasis and regeneration after injury, especially in the liver, which is composed of hepatocytes with both metabolic and regenerative capacities (Fausto et al., 2006). The unique regenerative capability of hepatocytes as differentiated cells after injury makes the liver an ideal in vivo model for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying quiescence exit. Recent studies have demonstrated that hepatocytes act like stem cells that possess regenerative potential to reenter the cell cycle and proliferate during liver regeneration (Michalopoulos and Bhushan, 2021; Matsumoto et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020). Upon quiescence exit, a process also known as priming/initiation, hepatocytes favor proliferative capacity over metabolism to meet the rapid hepatic growth demand. However, how the active metabolic state is transcriptionally altered and modulated during the G0/G1 transition remains to be elucidated.",
        "Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2), as a chromatin-binding protein (Lee et al., 2020; Tillotson and Bird, 2020), plays multiple roles in gene expression regulation, including transcriptional activation and repression, RNA splicing, chromatin remodeling, and regulation of chromatin architecture (Ezeonwuka and Rastegar, 2014). Given the high expression and pivotal role of Mecp2 in the brain, understanding the mechanisms of Mecp2 in neurological disorders such as Rett syndrome and autism has attracted intense interest (Tillotson and Bird, 2020; Ip et al., 2018; Guy et al., 2011). Furthermore, Mecp2 has also been identified as an oncogene highly expressed in several cancer types. Several lines of evidence suggest that the role of Mecp2 in malignancy mainly involves facilitation of cancer cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis (Babbio et al., 2012; Neupane et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017). The role of Mecp2 in quiescence exit and tissue regeneration and the underlying mechanisms have not been reported to the best of our knowledge.",
        "In this study, using a mouse model of injury-induced liver regeneration and cellular models of quiescence exit, we intriguingly found that Mecp2 is a cell cycle-dependent protein that is drastically abated during the G0/G1 transition and gradually restored at further stages of cell cycle progression. A sharp decline in Mecp2 expression is essential for efficient quiescence exit in response to extrinsic stimuli using both in vivo and in vitro models. Additionally, the E3 ligase Nedd4 contributes to the ubiquitination and degradation of Mecp2 at quiescence exit, which modulates the pace of quiescence exit. Mechanistically, Mecp2 governs quiescence exit by transcriptionally orchestrating proliferative and metabolic gene expression, among which many nuclear receptor genes (NRs) emerge as novel Mecp2-activated genes in quiescent cells. Together, our findings identify a critical negative regulatory role for Mecp2 in quiescence exit and tissue regeneration, partially through targeting several NRs.",
        "To screen for key regulators governing the initiation/priming phase of liver regeneration, we used the 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PHx) mouse model, a widely used in vivo model to study quiescence exit (Mitchell and Willenbring, 2008). Surprisingly, Mecp2, a well-known essential regulator of brain development, emerged as a dramatically repressed protein at the priming/initiation stage of PHx-induced liver regeneration. The expression kinetics of Mecp2 were examined at both the mRNA and protein levels in liver tissues at six time points after PHx, which cover the three phases of liver regeneration, namely priming/initiation, progression, and termination (Fausto et al., 2006; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). The results showed that Mecp2 was remarkably reduced as early as 6 hr after PHx, was further decreased at 12 hr and 24 hr, but was restored at the 48 and 120 h time points (Figure 1A and B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). The decrease in the active histone mark H3K27ac (Creyghton et al., 2010) at the Mecp2 promoter was consistent with the reduced transcriptional activity within 36 hr post-PHx (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Notably, Mecp2 protein levels were decreased more dramatically than mRNA, suggesting a post-translational regulation of Mecp2 at the very early stage of liver regeneration. The early acute reduction of Mecp2 in hepatocytes during liver regeneration, mainly in nuclei, was further validated by immunofluorescence (IF) staining (Figure 1C) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Figure 1D). To confirm the quiescence exit-specific reduction of Mecp2 in hepatocytes, we assessed proliferation-associated proteins that are widely used to distinguish the G0 from the G1 phase, including phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), Cyclin D1, and Ki67 (Figure 1B and D). The phosphorylation states of Rb, including unphosphorylated, hypo-phosphorylated, and hyper-phosphorylated Rb, can reflect G0, early G1, and late G1 phases, respectively (Narasimha et al., 2014). The results showed that pRb was undetectable by 6 hr after PHx. Accordingly, Cyclin D1, which mediates the phosphorylation of Rb, was also maintained at extremely low levels during the very early stage of liver regeneration. Several other cyclins important for the G1/S stage (Cyclin E1) and the G2/M stage (Cyclin A2 and B1) were also expressed at low levels, further supporting the negative correlation between the amount of Mecp2 and cell cycle reentry (Coller, 2007; Moser et al., 2018; Figure 1B). Moreover, Ki67, a well-known proliferation marker, which is degraded and barely detected in the G0 phase but accumulates during cell proliferation (Kim and Sederstrom, 2015; Miller et al., 2018), showed an inverse correlation with Mecp2 in hepatocytes within 48 hr after PHx (Figure 1D). It is worth noting that the acute reduction in Mecp2 during quiescence exit was gradually restored by 48–120 hr post-PHx, suggesting the functional involvement of Mecp2 in active cell cycle phases. Together, these findings demonstrate the identification of Mecp2 as a new cell cycle-associated protein, which is highly expressed in quiescent hepatocytes, sharply decreased at the G0/G1 transition, and gradually restored at later stages of cell cycle progression during injury-induced liver regeneration.",

        "Given the acute reduction of Mecp2 during hepatocyte quiescence exit, we asked whether Mecp2 prevents the G0/G1 transition. To this aim, we generated hepatocyte-specific Mecp2 conditional knockout mice (Mecp2-cKO) by crossing control mice containing Loxp sites flanking exons 2 and 3 of the Mecp2 gene (Mecp2fl/fl) with albumin (Alb)-Cre mice expressing Cre recombinase under the Alb promoter (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). The successful Mecp2 depletion in the liver was confirmed by genotyping (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B) and measuring the amount of Mecp2 at both mRNA and protein levels in Mecp2fl/fl and Mecp2-cKO mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D). Mecp2-cKO mice were viable and showed no obvious abnormalities in the liver compared to control littermates (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–G). PHx triggered the decay of Mecp2 in livers at 6 and 48 hr after PHx, which reflected the G0/G1 transition and M phase, respectively, in the remaining hepatocytes undergoing the first round of the cell cycle after PHx (Figure 2A–C). The results of western blotting and corresponding quantification in Mecp2-cKO livers indicated that Mecp2 depletion promoted quiescence exit in hepatocytes after PHx (Figure 2B). IF staining for Ki67 showed that Mecp2-deficient livers contained more proliferating hepatocytes than controls, further supporting the enhanced G0/G1 transition in Mecp2-cKO mice (Figure 2C). Accordingly, liver regeneration was significantly enhanced at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr after PHx based on the significantly higher liver index in the Mecp2-cKO mice than in the controls (Figure 2D). Therefore, hepatocyte-specific Mecp2 depletion accelerates quiescence exit in injury-induced regenerating livers.",

        "We next tested whether overexpression (OE) of Mecp2 in hepatocytes has an adverse effect on cell cycle reentry after PHx. Intravenous injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-TBG-Mecp2 (Greig et al., 2018) reinforced the levels of Mecp2 in hepatocytes compared to empty vector (EV) control cells (Figure 2E and F). Decreased protein levels of pRb and Cyclin D1, as well as lower levels of Ki67 in nuclei from Mecp2-overexpressing hepatocytes, were observed within 48 hr after PHx (Figure 2F and G). Expectedly, Mecp2 OE significantly delayed cell cycle reentry and resulted in a decreased liver index within 24 hr after PHx (Figure 2H). Therefore, Mecp2 OE negatively regulates quiescence exit in hepatocytes after PHx.",
        "To further confirm the specificity of Mecp2 on the regulation of quiescence exit, we performed rescue experiments using AAV-mediated Mecp2 OE in Mecp2-cKO livers (Figure 2I and J). The restoration of Mecp2 in Mecp2-depleted hepatocytes was accompanied by increased expression of cell cycle regulators and earlier appearance of Ki67 compared to the EV controls (Figure 2J and K). In addition, the increased liver index caused by the loss of Mecp2 was significantly compromised by Mecp2 restoration (Figure 2L). Therefore, forced restoration of Mecp2 rescues Mecp2 loss-induced accelerated quiescence exit.",
        "Notably, the modest but significant changes in liver regeneration caused by the manipulation of Mecp2 in the first 2 d after PHx disappeared 5 d post-PHx (Figure 2—figure supplement 1H–J), indicating the involvement of Mecp2 in not only quiescence exit but also in later stages of cell proliferation. Taken together, our in vivo analyses demonstrate that the rapid reduction of Mecp2 in hepatocytes is essential for efficient quiescence exit during injury-induced liver regeneration.",
        "We then asked whether the expression pattern of Mecp2 during the quiescence-proliferation transition is universal in cells. To this end, we released three types of cultured cells, including 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts, mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells, and human primary umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), from quiescence induced by two classical signals, that is, serum starvation (SS) and contact inhibition (CI) Coller et al., 2006. The cell cycle analysis in 3T3 cells showed that more than 90% of cells resided in the G0/G1 phase in response to SS (Figure 3A and B) or CI (Figure 3F and G), indicating the successful induction of quiescence. The expression kinetics revealed that serum restimulation (SR)- and/or CI loss (CIL)-induced cell cycle reentry of quiescent 3T3 cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in Mecp2 at the G0/G1 transition and its gradual restoration during cell cycle progression, resembling that seen after PHx-induced initiation of hepatocellular regeneration (Figure 3C, D, H, and I). The time course of IF staining for Ki67 and Mecp2 showed extremely low levels of Ki67 signals in nuclei within 6 hr after SR (Figure 3E) or 24 hr after CIL (Figure 3J), further supporting the reduction in Mecp2 at quiescence exit in 3T3 cells. Similar results were obtained in both HT22 cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–H) and HUVECs (Figure 3—figure supplement 1I–P). Taken together, this evidence suggests that the acute reduction in Mecp2 is a general phenomenon at the G0/G1 transition.",

Western blotting showed that Mecp2 depletion led to an earlier induction of pRb, Cyclin D1, as well as cyclin A, Cyclin B, and Cyclin E proteins (Figure 4B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and C). The accelerated cell cycle reentry in Mecp2 KD cells was also reflected by the earlier appearance of Ki67 (Figure 4C). Additionally, we used Ki67 and propidium iodide (PI) double staining followed by flow cytometry to quantify G0 cells (Ki67− with 2N DNA content) at early time points after quiescence exit with or without Mecp2 depletion. The results showed that Mecp2 KD significantly reduced G0 cells compared to negative control siRNA (NC si)-treated cells after SR (Figure 4D). As such, about 70% of control cells and over 90% of Mecp2 KD cells reentered the cell cycle at 6 hr post-SR, indicating that Mecp2 KD accelerated quiescence exit in 3T3 cells.

        "We then asked whether increased Mecp2 expression could postpone quiescence exit. To test this, we forced Mecp2 OE in 3T3 cells through lentiviral transduction (Figure 4E and F). Compared to the EV, Mecp2 OE resulted in the delayed quiescence exit phenotype upon SR, as evidenced by decreased expression of pRb, Cyclin D1, and other cell cycle protein, such as Cyclin A2, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin E1 (Figure 4F, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and D), delayed induction of Ki67 (Figure 4G), and a twofold increase in the proportion of cells residing in the G0 phase (Figure 4H). Notably, neither Mecp2 KD nor OE significantly affected the number of G0 cells without SR (Figure 4D and H), suggesting that Mecp2 functions upon receiving extracellular mobilization signals. Taken together, these results indicate that acute Mecp2 reduction at the G0/G1 transition is required for efficient quiescence exit.",
        "Given the more rapid decay of Mecp2 at the protein compared to the mRNA level during the quiescence-proliferation transition, we speculated that Mecp2 is targeted by post-translational regulation. This hypothesis was supported by proteasome inhibition with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which attenuated the reduction of Mecp2 in quiescent cells after SR (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). In contrast, the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine had no impact on the degradation of MeCP2 protein (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). To identify the proteins that regulate Mecp2 degradation during the G0/G1 transition, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) using Mecp2 antibody in quiescent 3T3 cells treated with or without SR (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). A total of 647 proteins were identified as putative Mecp2 interactors. We were particularly interested in the proteins involved in proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, which was one of the enriched Gene Ontology (GO) items in the Mecp2 interactome (Supplementary file 1). Among the candidate genes, we identified the ubiquitin ligase ‘neuronal precursor cell developmentally downregulated 4-1’ (Nedd4) that specifically interacted with endogenous Mecp2 by reciprocal IP-WB in 3T3 cells (Figure 5A). Co-IP using Mecp2 antibody revealed that Mecp2-associated ubiquitin and Nedd4 were dramatically increased at 3 hr and 6 hr post-SR (Figure 5B), suggesting that Nedd4 interacts with Mecp2 to induce the polyubiquitination and degradation of Mecp2 upon cell cycle reentry.",

        "Given the important role of Nedd4 in post-translational regulation of Mecp2, we reasoned that despite regulating internalization of major growth factor receptors involved in liver regeneration (Bachofner et al., 2017), Nedd4-mediated degradation of Mecp2 may be a new mechanism through which Nedd4 contributes to liver regeneration. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of Nedd4 on SR-induced quiescence exit of 3T3 cells. Knocking down Nedd4 using siRNA replenished the remarkable reduction of Mecp2 at the early stages of quiescence exit, and thus resulted in lower levels of proliferation markers such as pRb, Cyclin D1, and Ki67 (Figure 5C–E). Nedd4 deficiency significantly retained cells in the G0 phase upon SR (Figure 5F). On the contrary, Nedd4 OE significantly enhanced the degradation of Mecp2 and accordingly accelerated the quiescence exit, which mimicked the effect of Mecp2 depletion (Figure 5G–J). Thus, Nedd4 interacts with Mepc2 and regulates quiescence exit partially through post-translational regulation of Mecp2 upon quiescence exit.",
        "It has been well established that Mecp2 transcriptionally regulates gene expression by binding methylated CpG islands and chromatin proteins in the brain (Lee et al., 2020; Nan et al., 1997; Rube et al., 2016). However, little is known about the transcriptional targets of Mecp2 during hepatocyte quiescence exit in the regenerating liver. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying Mecp2-regulated quiescence exit, we performed RNA-seq combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify the Mecp2-dependent transcriptome genome-wide during the very early stage of liver regeneration (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). RNA-seq and comparative analyses in control Mecp2fl/fl and Mecp2-cKO mice livers before and 6 hr after PHx revealed 3048 Mecp2-dependent genes that were differentially expressed in a Mecp2-dependent manner. Meanwhile, we mapped the binding landscape of Mecp2 in Mecp2fl/fl livers before and after PHx using ChIP-seq by filtering out peaks identified in Mecp2-cKO livers (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). It has been reported that Mecp2 occupies a large proportion of the genome in the brain due to its methyl-CpG (mCpG)-binding preference (Lee et al., 2020; Rube et al., 2016; Lagger et al., 2017). Similarly, we identified a total of 14,640 and 15,350 Mecp2-binding genes before and after PHx in the Mecp2 control liver, respectively (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B). To further identify putative Mecp2-direct target genes, we integrated Mecp2-dependent genes with Mecp2-binding genes (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). As a result, there were 2658 Mecp2 direct target genes, in which 537 were PHx-activated and 2121 were PHx-repressed genes (Figure 6A). GO analysis showed that PHx-activated Mecp2 targets, which are either silent or basally expressed in quiescent hepatocytes, were highly enriched in proliferation-associated biological processes such as ribosome biogenesis, rRNA metabolic process, ncRNA metabolic process, and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase I, whereas PHx-repressed Mecp2 targets, which are highly expressed in quiescent hepatocytes, were associated with several metabolic processes including carboxylic acid catabolic process, cellular amino acid metabolic process, fatty acid metabolic process, and steroid metabolic process (Figure 6B). Notably, among PHx-repressed genes, several NRs were newly identified as Mecp2 direct targets, such as Nr2f6, Nr3c1, Nr1h3, Nr1i3, Nr6a1, Rxrg, Rara, Nr4a1, Srebf1, and Ppard (Figure 6A). To gain insights into the relevance between Mecp2 occupancy and the differential expression of Mecp2 direct targets, we interrogated the binding strength of Mecp2 in the promoter-proximal regions (within 3 kb of the transcription start sites [TSS]) and defined gene regions (±25 kb around the TSS and transcription end sites [TES]) (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). Intriguingly, Mecp2 occupancy at these regions was not apparently altered after PHx, which was inconsistent with its protein levels, suggesting that the majority of Mecp2 is not tightly associated with the genome in quiescent hepatocytes and Mecp2 may recruit other factor(s) to achieve the differential transcriptional outcomes in response to extrinsic stimuli (Figure 6C).",

        "Because the liver is a key metabolic organ, we paid particular attention to Mecp2-regulated NRs, whose alteration may result in a shift in the balance between metabolism and proliferation. The Mecp2-dependent transcriptional repression of 10 NRs upon hepatic resection was validated using real-time qPCR in both Mecp2 control and cKO livers (Figure 6D). Notably, the mRNA levels of NRs were significantly higher in Mecp2fl/fl than in Mecp2-cKO livers before PHx, suggesting that Mecp2 contributes to the transcriptional activation of NRs in normal livers while Mecp2 degradation upon PHx leads to their deactivation. We also confirmed the repression of NRs in SR-induced 3T3 cell quiescence exit (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D). We did not detect the expression of Nr1i3 and Rxrg in quiescent 3T3 cells either before or after G0 exit, and failed to validate the repression of Nr4a1, suggesting that Mecp2-mediated transcriptional repression of NRs may vary with cell type and/or mobilization signals. Thus, these results suggest that Mecp2 plays a negative regulatory role during quiescence exit by activating metabolism-associated genes while repressing proliferation-associated genes in quiescent cells.",
        "To interrogate the functional relevance of Mecp2-mediated repression of NRs to quiescence exit, we selected two candidate genes for further investigation, Rara and Nr1h3. Retinoic acid (RA) has long been recognized as a liver mitogen required for normal liver regeneration (Bushue and Wan, 2009). Rara and Rarb as receptors for RA have been recently identified to mediate RA-induced hepatocyte proliferation after PHx (Liu et al., 2014). Cholesterol is another important regulator of cell proliferation. Nr1h3 (LXR) is highly expressed in the liver and has recently been reported to reduce hepatocyte proliferative capacity during PHx-induced regeneration by regulating genes involved in lipid and cholesterol homeostasis (Lo Sasso et al., 2010; Willy et al., 1995). We first performed ChIP-qPCR to confirm the significantly decreased binding intensity of Mecp2 at proximal promoter regions of both Rara and Nr1h3 upon exit quiescence (Figure 7A). Using lentivirus-mediated gene knockdown, we then tested whether individual disruption of two candidate NRs might affect SR-induced quiescence exit in 3T3 cells (Figure 7B). The results of western blotting showed that depletion of either Nr1h3 or Rara significantly accelerated the G0/G1 transition, as measured by the expression of pRb and Cyclin D1 (Figure 7C) and by flow cytometry (Figure 7D), mimicking the Mecp2 KD phenotype. Therefore, Mecp2 prevents quiescence exit, at least in part, by repressing Rara and Nr1h3.",

        "We then asked whether depletion of Rara or Nr1h3 can further promote quiescence exit in Mecp2-cKO livers. We performed AAV-mediated gene knockdown to target Rara and Nr1h3 in Mecp2-cKO livers using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (Figure 7E). Because of the limited number of cKO animals, we could only assess the effects at 6 hr post-PHx. The results showed that knockdown of either Rara or Nr1h3 in combination with Mecp2-cKO can modestly but significantly further accelerate quiescence exit during PHx-induced liver regeneration (Figure 7F–H). Therefore, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, this study has revealed a positive correlation between the repression of Mecp2-activated NRs and quiescence exit, and has identified novel roles of Rara and Nr1h3 in regulating quiescence exit in vitro and in vivo.",
        "The accurate transition from quiescence to the active cell cycle is crucial for the control of eukaryotic cell proliferation and adult stem cell-mediated tissue homeostasis and regeneration after injury. Conversely, dysregulation of quiescence exit may compromise tissue integrity and lead to oncogenesis. In this work, we sought to explore the general molecular mechanisms that regulate quiescence by focusing on Mecp2, a multifunctional protein with a broad spectrum of activities. Using genetic mouse models, cellular models, and genome-wide approaches, we uncovered a regulatory capacity of Mecp2 in quiescence exit (Figure 7I). In quiescent cells, Mecp2 is maintained at relative high levels and serves as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. It binds to and activates metabolic genes, such as several NRs, while repressing proliferation-associated genes in quiescent and metabolically hyperactive hepatocytes. In response to extrinsic stimuli, such as injury and mitogenic stimulation, the protein levels of Mecp2 are acutely decreased by both transcriptional repression and Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination. The remarkable reduction of Mecp2 releases the transcriptional repression of proliferation-associated genes while compromising the activation of metabolic genes in order to satisfy a rapidly regenerating demand of the remaining hepatocytes, eventually leading to quiescence exit and cell cycle progression. The transient repression of Mecp2 during quiescence exit and its restoration during further cell cycle progression probably serve as means to avoid overinhibition of metabolism and guarantee the appropriate metabolic adaption required for cell proliferation. Therefore, our results suggest that quiescent cells employ Mecp2 to balance the needs of cell division and metabolism upon receiving extrinsic signals.",
        "Although it has been reported that Mecp2 null mice develop fatty liver (Kyle et al., 2016), the Mecp2-cKO mice used in our study did not demonstrate obvious abnormalities, such as necrosis or liver damage when we performed PHx (Figure 2—figure supplement 1G). Based on our comparative analysis of RNA-seq data from control and Mecp2 cKO livers before PHx, only 90 upregulated and 128 downregulated genes (log2 |FC|>1.5, p<0.05) were identified, which did not enrich any GO terms with adjusted p<1 × 10–3, further supporting the notion that liver-specific deletion of Mecp2 does not cause liver abnormalities in 3-month-old mice. This allowed us to study liver regeneration in mice with non-damaged livers and avoid any defects prior to injury. It is worth noting that, other than accelerated cell cycle reentry, Mecp2 cKO hepatocytes also displayed a modest increase in cell size with enlarged nuclei relative to control cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1G), implying the attenuation of mitosis.",
        "It has been well documented that both overexpression and depletion of Mecp2 have deleterious effects on neuronal homeostasis (Na et al., 2013), and thus, tight regulation of Mecp2 protein levels is critical for its physiological functions. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that many Rett syndrome-causing mutations in the methyl-CpG binding domain not only compromise DNA binding capacity of Mecp2 but also reduce its protein stability, implying the relevance of protein stability in Mecp2 dysfunction (Tillotson and Bird, 2020; Chen et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2016). Mecp2 has been shown to undergo various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation, which may also affect protein stability (Ausió et al., 2014). Protein degradation via ubiquitination is the most prevalent recycling machinery used by cells. Despite 11 identified ubiquitination sites in Mecp2, our knowledge about the E3 ligases that catalyze the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to these sites remains scarce (Lamonica et al., 2017; Bellini et al., 2014). Recently, Wang, 2014 uncovered the role of RING Finger Protein 4 (RNF4) in transcriptional activation by mediating the ubiquitination of Mecp2. Herein, we discovered Nedd4 as a novel regulator of Mecp2 protein stability. Nedd4 has recently been identified as an essential regulator of liver regeneration through post-translational modification of growth factor signaling (Bachofner et al., 2017). Consistent with our results, Bachofner et al. reported in vivo knockdown of Nedd4 in hepatocytes caused inhibition of cell proliferation after PHx. Although we identified Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of Mecp2 in the cellular model of quiescence exit, we also measured the expression of Nedd4 at the early stages of liver regeneration (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D), which in turn may drive hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle by targeting Mecp2. Further studies are needed to explore what domain(s) is (are) responsible for the interaction between Mecp2 and Nedd4, which corresponding ubiquitylation sites within Mecp2 are targeted by Nedd4, and whether ubiquitylation site mutations of Mecp2 can completely abolish cell cycle reentry.",
        "The switch from quiescence to active cycling requires coordinating all the necessary metabolic and cell cycle machinery. There is an urgent need to synthesize DNA, proteins, and lipids required for the generation of daughter cells in resting cells reentering the cell cycle (Coller, 2019). Regarding injury-induced hepatic regeneration, a global transcriptome shift from metabolism to proliferation is a reasonable strategy to satisfy the proliferating needs at the early stages of liver regeneration after PHx (Liu and Chen, 2017). Consistently, we observed an increase in gene expression involved in mRNA abundance, splicing, and translation, and a decrease in genes enriched in fatty acid, lipid, and amino acid metabolism at 6 hr post-PHx in a Mecp2-dependent manner (Figure 6A and B). This metabolic repression is transient and largely restored when the regenerating liver reaches its original size. Yet, how Mecp2 differentially regulates proliferation-associated and metabolic genes is a fascinating question that remains unanswered in our study and merits further investigation.",
        "In this study, we discovered that Mecp2-mediated transcriptional activation of genes involved in metabolism is one of the mechanisms that prevents exit from quiescence. Specifically, we identified 10 NRs, which are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The NR superfamily can be divided into three classes based on their ligands and mechanisms of action, including the steroid receptor family, the thyroid/retinoid family, and the orphan receptor family (Rudraiah et al., 2016; Pearen and Muscat, 2012; Zheng and Murphy, 2016). To date, studies on NRs have elucidated the roles of several NRs in regulating hepatomegaly and liver regeneration, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα or Nr1c1, and PPARγ or Nr1c3), pregnane X receptor (PXR, Nr1i2), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, Nr1i3), liver X receptor (LXR, Nr1h3), and farnesoid X receptor (FXR, Nr1h4) (Zhao et al., 2022). Among these genes, Nr1i3 and Nr1h3 also emerged as PHx-repressed Mecp2-activated NRs in our study. Consistent with our observations, Sasso et al. demonstrated that Nr1h3, which is responsible for cholesterol catabolism and fatty acid synthesis, acts as an inhibitor of liver regeneration (Lo Sasso et al., 2010). However, they did not observe the decreased mRNA levels of both LXR isoforms (Nr1h3 and Nr1h2) mainly because they monitored the transcriptional levels at 1 d post-PHx, which was not early enough to capture the upstream changes in transcriptional regulation. In general, previous studies have barely focused on the connection between quiescence exit and NRs. Based on our observations, the inhibition of certain NRs by Mecp2 depletion during quiescence exit is probably general and not hepatocyte-specific because we also validated the repression of several NRs in cellular models of quiescence exit. Additionally, the functional validation of Nr1h3 and Rara in 3T3 cells further supports the notion that Mecp2 may postpone cell cycle reentry through activating NRs. However, not all NRs exhibit the same function in quiescence exit. Huang and colleagues reported that the absence of the primary nuclear bile acid receptor FXR (also known as Nr1h4) strongly inhibited liver growth in the early stages of regeneration (Huang et al., 2006). Therefore, the cell type- and/or stimulus-specific function and detailed mechanisms for certain NRs in regulating quiescence exit await further investigation. Our study highlights the importance of NRs in mediating Mecp2-regulated quiescence exit, which may serve as attractive therapeutic targets after further investigation of the underlying mechanisms.",
        "In summary, our study opens a brand-new perspective to understand the functional involvement of Mecp2 as a general regulator of quiescence exit and has provided insight into the mechanisms that may link metabolism to quiescence exit. Differential targeting of Mecp2 based on its different roles at different cell-cycle phases should be taken into consideration when examining potential clinical applications.",

        "This fundamental study provides insights into the mechanism controlling cell cycle reentry, establishing a regulatory role for Mecp2 degradation in shifting transcription from metabolic to proliferation genes during quiescence exit. The evidence, which includes experimental data from in vitro cell culture and an in vivo injury-induced liver regeneration model, is convincing but the trigger for MeCP2 degradation and how MeCP2 differentially regulates proliferation and metabolic genes remains unclear.",
        "In the study described in the manuscript, the authors identified Mecp2, a methyl-CpG binding protein, as a key regulator involved in the transcriptional shift during the exit of quiescent cells into the cell cycle. Their data show that Mecp2 levels were remarkably reduced during the priming/initiation stage of partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration and that altered Mecp2 expression affected the quiescence exit. Additionally, the authors identified Nedd4 E3 ligase that is required for downregulation of Mecp2 during quiescence exit. This is an interesting study with well-presented data that supports the authors' conclusions regarding the role of Mecp2 in transcription regulation during the G0/G1 transition. However, the significance of the study is limited by a lack of mechanistic insights into the function of Mecp2 in the process. This weakness can be addressed by identifying the signaling pathway(s) that trigger Mecp2 degradation during the quiescence exit.",
        "The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.",
        "Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):",
        "(1) Since the data suggests that the degradation of Mecp2 is a crucial event in the exit from quiescence, gaining a better understanding of the underlying mechanism would improve the significance of the study. In this regard, the authors should take advantage of the serum stimulated degradation of Mecp2 (Fig. 3D) to identify the signaling pathway(s) required for the degradation.",
        "Thank you for this suggestion. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying Mecp2-regulated quiescence exit, we performed RNA-seq combined with ChIP-seq to identify the Mecp2-dependent transcriptome genome-wide during the early stage of liver regeneration (Figure S6C). There were 2658 Mecp2 direct target genes, in which 537 were PHx-activated and 2121 were PHx-repressed genes (Figure 6A). GO analysis showed that PHx-activated Mecp2 targets were highly enriched in proliferation-associated biological processes such as ribosome biogenesis, rRNA metabolic process, ncRNA metabolic process, and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase I, whereas PHx-repressed Mecp2 targets were associated with several metabolic processes including carboxylic acid catabolic process, cellular amino acid metabolic process, fatty acid metabolic process and steroid metabolic process (Figure 6B). These results suggest that Mecp2 plays a negative regulatory role during quiescence exit by activating metabolism-associated genes while repressing proliferation-associated genes in quiescent cells.",
        "Given the more rapid decay of Mecp2 at the protein compared to the mRNA level during the quiescence-proliferation transition, we speculated that Mecp2 is targeted by posttranslational regulation. This hypothesis was supported by proteasome inhibition with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which attenuated the reduction of Mecp2 in quiescent cells after S.R. (Figure S5A). To identify the signaling pathway that regulate Mecp2 degradation during the G0/G1 transition, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) using Mecp2 antibody in quiescent 3T3 cells treated with or without S.R. (Figure S5B). A total of 647 proteins were identified as putative Mecp2 interactors. We were particularly interested in the proteins involved in proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process which was one of the enriched Gene Ontology (GO) items in the Mecp2 interactome (Table S1).",
        "(2) The authors suggest that Mecp2 downregulation accelerates the induction of pRb, which serves as a key marker for G0/G1 transition. However, their data only show increased magnitudes of the expression in Mecp2 downregulated cells at the timepoints when samples were collected (Figs. 2B and 4B). In the in vitro experiments, the authors should investigate earlier timepoints to demonstrate that induction of pRB during the quiescence exit occurs earlier in Mecp2 deficient cells compared to control cells. Likewise, a later induction of pRB in Mecp2 overexpression cells, in comparison to normal cells, should be demonstrated.",
        "Thank you for these valuable suggestions. We have, accordingly, collected cell samples re-entered the cell cycle at 30-, 60-, 90- and 120-minutes post-S.R. We examined the pRb expression and found that phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) at Ser807/811 occurs earlier (about 90 minutes) in Mecp2 deficient cells compared to control cells (Figure S4C). Compared to the EV, Mecp2 OE resulted in the delayed induction of pRB (about 60 minutes) upon S.R. (Figure S4D). These data indicate that enhanced reduction of Mecp2 stimulates exit from quiescence.",
        "(3) There are three well-known phosphorylation sites in Mecp2, including S80, S229, and S423. As protein ubiquitination and degradation are often triggered by phosphorylation, it would be interesting to examine whether phosphorylation at these sites of Mecp2 is required for its downregulation during quiescence exit. This can be achieved using non-phosphorylate mutants of Mecp2.",
        "This is a very good question. Indeed, the 26S ubiquitin-proteasome system (26S UPS) is responsible for the breakdown of MeCP2 (PMID: 28394263, 28973632). In 2009, the bona fide PEST (enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) domains have been identified, which are highly conserved across vertebrate evolution (PMID: 19319913). Consensus sequences enriched in PEST residues have been found to predispose proteins containing them for rapid proteolytic degradation (PMID: 8755249, 2876518). In addition, phosphorylation within PEST motifs precedes ubiquitination of proteins (PMID: 15229225). One of the best characterized sites of MeCP2 phosphorylation (S80) (PMID: 19225110), as well as one of the identified ubiquitination sites (K82/K99) (PMID: 22615490), both fall within one of these regions. It is still noteworthy that most of the MeCP2 phosphorylation sites were found in close proximity to potential ubiquitylation sites. For example, Rett syndrome missense mutations in Rett syndrome affecting three (K82R, K135A, K256S) of the ubiquitination sites (PMID: 25165434) and S80 (within one of the PEST sequences) and K82 have been shown to be phosphorylated and ubiquitinated.",
        "Based on the above discussion, we providing a potential hypothesis that the MeCP2 turnover during cell cycle re-entry is achieved by an initial phosphorylation signal (phosphorylated at S80, S229, or S421) that triggers the ubiquitination of a close lysine residue. We hope to solve these issues and be able to present the findings in future work. Thanks again for your professional suggestions.",
        "(4) It would be interesting if the authors could also examine the effect of altered expression of Mecp2 on the maintenance of quiescence. For example, whether the downregulation of Mecp2 sensitizes quiescent cells for entry of the cell cycle in response to serum stimulation or delays withdrawal from the cell cycle upon serum starvation or contact inhibition.",
        "Thank you for your suggestions. Cell cycle synchronization was induced with serum deprivation. When nutrients are exhausted, altered expression of Mecp2 have no statistical influence on the maintenance of quiescence as analyzed by Flow cytometric (Figure 4D and H). This suggests that the altered expression of Mecp2 alone may not be sufficient for cell cycle exit. In the presence of growth factors or nutrients, loss of MeCP2 only accelerates the rate of cell cycle re-entry.",
        "Minor points:",
        "For Figs. 2D, 2H, and 2L, it would be more intuitive if the percentage of changes in liver index rather than the relative index values were used. Also, the values listed in the figures should start from time zero after partial hepatectomy rather than pre-surgery.",
        "Liver weight have the corresponding change with body weight. The liver index (ratio of regenerate liver weight/body weight) is tightly regulated and depends on metabolic demands of the organism. During the course of liver regeneration, reestablishment of liver volume after resection is regulated by the functional needs of the organism. Using the percentage of regenerate liver weight/body weight as a liver growth index could reflect the regenerative function.Next, we agree with the data presentation form and the values listed in the figures have been modified in the revised version.",
        "Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for The Authors):",
        "My concerns are as follows:",
        "(1) The authors note that the decrease in Mecp2 protein levels was more pronounced than the decrease in mRNA levels, suggesting the presence of post-translational regulation of Mecp2 during the early stages of G0 exit. Could the decrease in MeCP2 levels be related to autophagy flux?",
        "Thank you for your valuable comments. Also, we have compared the cells extracts from untreated and chloroquine-treated cells (to block lysosomal degradation). Chloroquine did not cause any accumulation of MeCP2 (Figure S5B). The results suggest that autophagy activity do not involve in the decrease the MeCP2 protein.",
        "(2) In addition to Cyclin D1, how about other cell cycle-related proteins (cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin E) were changed when MeCP2 was lost during cell cycle re-entry? Protein expression should be examined by western blot.",
        "We appreciate your valuable suggestions. The expression of cell cycle related protein cyclin A2, cyclin B1 and cyclin E1 were evaluated by Western blotting. The expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1 and cyclin E1 was enhanced by the knockdown of MeCP2 (Figure 4B). Conversely, the repressed expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1 and cyclin E1 was observed by the over-expression of MeCP2 (Figure 4F).",
        "(3) By combining MeCP2 ChIP-seq and RNA-seq of genes regulated by MeCP2, the authors uncovered the dual role of Mecp2 in preventing quiescence exit by targeting Rara and Nr1h3. All they show are the Q-PCR results. The authors should show the protein level of Rara and Nr1h3 when MeCP2 was lost during cell cycle re-entry.",
        "Thank you for your advice. In Figure 7C, the knockdown efficiency of Rara and Nr1h3 were checked by Western blot analysis.",
        "(4) The authors performed lentiviral and AAV-mediated gene knockdown to target Rara and Nr1h3 in Cells and Mecp2-cKO livers, respectively. The Knockdown efficacy should be verified by western blots (Fig 7 C and F).",
        "In Figure 7F, the consequences of the Rara and Nr1h3 knockdown efficiency was verified by Western blot analysis.",
        "(5) The other major concern is regarding the lack of quantitative assessments of MeCP2 WB results (Fig 2, Fig 4, and Fig 7).",
        "Thank you for this suggestion. We added supplementary figures to Figure 2B, 2F and 2J to show the quantification membrane signal of MeCP2 protein in liver regeneration. And Fig S4A and 4B showing the quantification signal of MeCP2 protein in NIH3t3 cell cycle re-entry model.",
        "(6) In the Figure legends of Fig 4 B and Fig 4F, the authors should delete the statistical descriptions, as there are no statistical results. In Fig 5F, Fig 5J, Fig 6D, Fig 7D and Fig7H, there are no statistical results of **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05 or ****p < 0.0001, respectively. The authors should check the description in the figure legends. In Fig S2C, the level of significance should be annotated.",
        "We would like to express our heartfelt thanks for your thorough reading of our manuscript. We have made corrections to make manuscript clearer and more accurate. The level of significance have been annotated in Fig S2C.",
        "(7) In Fig S4A, there are no WB results of Cyclin D1 and pRb, the authors should check the description.",
        "Thank you for pointing this out. We have deleted the confusing statements in the revised manuscript."

        "Mitochondria dysfunction contributes to acute liver injuries. Zhang et al. find that Zhx2 deletion enhances mitochondrial function by promoting electron transport chain gene expression via PGC-1α dependent and independent manner.",
        "Liver is the largest internal organ of the human body and is responsible for metabolism, immunity, digestion, detoxification, and protein synthesis, and is characterized by robust regenerative capacity in response to injury1,2. Mitochondria act as the critical metabolic and signaling hubs to maintain liver homeostasis, flexibility, and survival3. Abnormal mitochondrial function has been reported to not only trigger the onset of various liver diseases, but also contribute to acute liver injury and liver failure caused by infection, toxin, and drug abuse4–8. Hepatic mitochondrial oxidative capacity varies broadly across the spectrum of obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD)7, and studies on the contributions of altered mitochondria in liver metabolic diseases are controversial. For instance, lifestyle modifications and drugs that are able to enhance mitochondrial function are successful in improving NAFLD and NASH9. On the contrary, loss of mitochondrial OXPHOS could protect against diet-induced steatosis and NASH progression10. Nevertheless, controlling mitochondrial dysfunction might provide a promising strategy forward to the treatment of liver diseases, especially for acute liver injury.",
        "Emerging evidence demonstrates that mitochondria play a central role in liver regeneration during acute liver injuries11,12. After hepatectomy, mitochondria support hepatocyte proliferation by producing ATP through OXPHOS to meet the bioenergetic demands of hepatocytes13. Improvement of mitochondrial biogenesis increases mitochondrial OXPHOS to promote liver regeneration after 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PHx)14. However, currently limited number of mitochondrial function regulators has been identified in liver injuries. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is essential for the upregulation of electron transport chain (ETC) genes, activation of respiratory chain, increase of mitochondrial mass, and the augmentation of mitochondrial respiratory capacity15. TRPM8 (transient receptor potential melastatin 8) enhances metabolism and promotes hepatocytes proliferation in mice after hepatectomy16. Methylation-controlled J protein (MCJ) is a distinct co-chaperone that localizes at the mitochondrial inner membrane17. The absence of MCJ enhances mitochondrial activity to promote liver regeneration4,18. In addition, mutation of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), another well-known mitochondrial modulator, causes neonatal liver failure associated with mtDNA depletion19. Knockout of mitochondrial topoisomerase I (Top1mt) interrupts the biogenesis of mitochondrial and declines the capacity of liver regeneration20. Therefore, targeting mitochondrial regulation seems to be an appropriate strategy to improve repair of liver injury and there is an urgent need to identify mitochondrial regulators.",
        "Transcription factor Zinc-finger and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) has been identified as a critical regulator of liver postnatal gene expression, cell proliferation, and hepatic lipid hemostasis21–25. Importantly, loss of Zhx2 accounts partially for high-fat diet-induced lipid accumulation and liver damage26. Further studies demonstrated that ZHX2 inhibits exogenous lipid uptake and de novo lipid synthesis27,28, both biological processes are closely associated with ATP production from mitochondria. However, whether ZHX2 plays a role in mitochondrial regulation during liver injury and repair is largely unexplored. Here, we show that hepatocyte-specific knockout of Zhx2 enhances mitochondrial OXPHOS and promotes liver recovery after acute injury. Mechanistically, ZHX2 represses expression of mitochondrial ETC genes through PGC-1α-dependent and independent manner to inhibit mitochondrial OXPHOS and reduce mitochondrial mass. Clinical data verify the negative correlation of ZHX2 expression with mitochondrial mass in patients with drug-induced liver injury (DILI). These findings demonstrate that ZHX2 is a regulator of mitochondria function that contributes to the repair of liver injury and may serve as a drug target for acute liver injury with mitochondrial dysfunction.",
        "To assess the potential involvement of ZHX2 in hepatic mitochondrial regulation, we first performed bioinformatics analysis using a published dataset with ZHX2 manipulation29. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated the significant enrichment of the gene sets encoding OXPHOS and ETC OXPHOS system in control cells relative to ZHX2-overexpressing L02 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Furthermore, we performed GSEA in acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure (ALF) cohort (GSE74000) using median of ZHX2 expression levels as a cutoff30. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1b, OXPHOS-related gene sets were enriched in low ZHX2 groups from ALF cohorts. Together, bioinformatics analyses indicate that ZHX2 is associated with mitochondrial function.",
        "To confirm the role of ZHX2 in mitochondrial regulation, mitochondrial biogenesis was examined in HCC cell line Huh7 with ZHX2 manipulation (Supplementary Fig. 1c). As shown in Fig. 1a, b, overexpression of ZHX2 in Huh7 cells decreased mitochondrial mass, as evidenced by lower copy number of mtDNA, weaker intensities of Mito Tracker deep red, less total mitochondrial area as well as fewer mitochondrial filamentous network. In accordance, knockdown of ZHX2 led to augmented mtDNA copy number and higher levels of Mito Tracker deep red in Huh7 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Importantly, ZHX2 greatly inhibited mitochondrial OXPHOS, presented as lower JC-1 aggregates in ZHX2-overexpressing Huh7 cells and higher JC-1 aggregates in ZHX2-knockdown Huh7 cells (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1e). Consistently, ZHX2 overexpression reduced oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (Fig. 1d), while ZHX2 silence promoted mitochondrial OXPHOS (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Subsequently, ZHX2 decreased ATP generation, indicated as lower ATP levels, reduced ratios of ATP/AMP and ATP/ADP, and higher AMP levels in ZHX2-overexpressing Huh7 cells than those of control (Fig. 1e). On the contrary, ZHX2 knockdown increased ATP generation (Supplementary Fig. 1g).Fig. 1Interruption of ZHX2 enhances hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS in vitro and in vivo.a The copy number of mtDNA (left) and intensity of Mito tracker deep red (right) in Huh7 cells with ZHX2 overexpression were determined by qPCR and flow cytometry, respectively.

        "To further validate the above results, both human hepatic organoids and murine primary hepatocytes were included. ZHX2 was successfully knocked down in human hepatic organoids (Supplementary Fig. 1h). Importantly, knockdown of ZHX2 increased mitochondrial mass and ATP generation in human hepatic organoids (Fig. 1f). Consistently, ZHX2 knockout markedly increased mitochondrial mass, enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential, and promoted ATP production in primary hepatocytes isolated from hepatocyte-specific Zhx2 knockout mice (Zhx2-KOhep) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 1i). Above all, these data demonstrate that ZHX2 inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS in hepatocytes.",
        "Since mitochondria play important roles in the repair of damaged liver and ZHX2 regulates mitochondrial function, we hypothesized that ZHX2 might involve in liver recovery from damage. To address this, 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PHx), the widely used mice model of acute liver injury, was performed with Zhx2-KOhep mice and their littermate controls (Zhx2-WT). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a, Zhx2 mRNA levels were largely reduced in mice liver at 24 h after damage. Although the initial body weight, liver weight, and liver/body weight ratios were comparable between Zhx2-KOhep and Zhx2-WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 2b), the liver/body weight ratios following 2/3 PHx were recovered faster in Zhx2-KOhep mice than that in Zhx2-WT mice, and the liver mass of Zhx2-KOhep mice was larger than that of Zhx2-WT mice at 96 h after 2/3 PHx (Fig. 2a). In line with the rapid liver mass restoration, we observed an earlier induction of Cyclin D1 at 12 h post 2/3 PHx in Zhx2-KOhep mice and this increase of Cyclin D1 lasted until 48 h after PHx in Zhx2-KOhep mice. In agreement, enhanced expression of Cyclin A2, Cyclin B1, Cyclin E1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at both mRNA and protein levels were observed at different time points post 2/3 PHx in Zhx2-KOhep mice (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Meanwhile, the numbers of BrdU-positive cells and mitotic cells in the livers of Zhx2-KOhep mice were higher than those of Zhx2-WT mice (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2d). As expected, the livers of both groups recovered almost completely at 7 days after PHx. We did not detect any significant differences of ALT, AST and H&E staining between Zhx2-KOhep and Zhx2-WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 2e, f).

        "To test whether ZHX2-mediated liver recovery is specific to 2/3 PHx, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) exposure was performed on Zhx2-KOhep and Zhx2-WT mice to mimic chemical-induced liver injury. As expected, Zhx2 deficiency significantly increased the expression of cell-cycle-related genes (Cyclin D1, Cyclin A2, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin E1) and PCNA at 48 and 72 h after CCl4 exposure (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2i). Notably, loss of Zhx2 decreased the cell death and liver damage caused by CCl4, as assessed by reduced serum levels of ALT and AST, decreased necrotic areas, and lower number of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 2e–g). Taken together, these results demonstrate that hepatic Zhx2 deficiency promotes liver repair from acute injuries induced either by mechanical or chemical factors.",
        "To decipher the underlying mechanism for liver recovery from an acute injury, we performed multi-omics with liver tissues from Zhx2-KOhep and Zhx2-WT mice at 48 h after 2/3 PHx (Supplementary Fig. 3a). RNA-seq identified a total of 1091 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (fold change ≥ 2.00, adjusted p value ≤ 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) revealed multiple upregulated gene sets in Zhx2-KOhep mice, including E2F targets and G2M checkpoint (Supplementary Fig. 3c), two known signatures related with damaged liver recovery31,32. Notably, metabolism-related gene sets were upregulated in Zhx2-KOhep mice, of which OXPHOS was the most significantly upregulated gene set (Supplementary Fig. 3c). GSEA further showed the enrichment of mitochondrial related gene sets, including OXPHOS gene set (Fig. 3a). Consistently, quantitative proteomics identified a total of 644 differentially expressed proteins (fold change ≥ 1.2) between Zhx2-KOhep and Zhx2-WT mice at 48 h after 2/3 PHx, and KEGG analyses revealed metabolic pathway as one of top ten altered pathways in Zhx2-KOhep mice (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Further analysis of differentially expressed proteins in metabolic pathways showed that about 15.8% proteins were involved in mitochondria-related metabolic pathways, including energy metabolism, lipid and amino acid metabolism (Fig. 3b). Subsequently, energy metabolomics showed that the metabolites in mitochondrial ETC were enriched in the liver of Zhx2-KOhep mice (Fig. 3c), and the levels of ATP were significantly higher while the levels of ADP were lower in the liver of Zhx2-KOhep mice than Zhx2-WT mice at 48 h after 2/3 PHx (Fig. 3d). Collectively, multi-omics data suggest that ZHX2 regulates mitochondrial OXPHOS during liver repair after acute injury.Fig. 3Enhanced OXPHOS activity in hepatocytes with Zhx2 deficiency during damaged liver repair.a–c RNA-seq (a), quantitative proteomic analysis (b) and energy metabolomics (c) were performed with liver tissues from Zhx2-KOhep and Zhx2-WT mice at 48 h after 2/3 PHx. a GSEA was used to analyze the genes with differential mRNA levels.

        "To verify multi-omics findings, mitochondrial functional assays were performed in primary hepatocytes isolated from mice at 48 h after 2/3 PHx. As shown in Fig. 3e, mtDNA copy number was increased in primary hepatocytes of Zhx2-KOhep mice at 48 h after 2/3 PHx. Consistently, electron microscopy detected higher mitochondrial volume density in hepatocytes from Zhx2-KOhep mice (Fig. 3f). Subsequently, Zhx2 knockout largely increased mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1 aggregates), oxygen consumption and mitochondrial OXPHOS in primary hepatocytes isolated from mice at 48 h after 2/3 PHx (Fig. 3g–i). Similarly, the ATP levels, ATP/AMP and ATP/ADP ratios were higher while the AMP levels were lower in Zhx2-KOhep hepatocytes than those of Zhx2-WT hepatocytes (Fig. 3j and Supplementary Fig. 3e). Altogether, loss of Zhx2 promotes mitochondrial function during the repair of injured livers.",
        "To further verify that Zhx2 knockout facilitates repair of injured liver by regulating mitochondrial OXPHOS, metformin, a widely accepted inhibitor that indirectly targets mitochondrial complex I and inhibits OXPHOS and ATP production33,34, was used to treat Huh7 cells and mice. As shown in Fig. 4a, b, ZHX2 silence led to enhancement of mitochondrial membrane potential and AMP to ATP conversion in Huh7 cells, and these enhancements were abolished by metformin treatment. Importantly, liver regeneration and ATP production in metformin pretreated mice were assessed by following 2/3 PHx (Fig. 4c). As expected, metformin administration abolished the enhanced liver regeneration in Zhx2-KOhep mice, as demonstrated by the abrogation of increased liver/body weight ratio (Fig. 4d). Consistently, metformin treatment eliminated the increased levels of PCNA, Cyclin A2, Cyclin D1 proteins and increased numbers of BrdU-positive cells in Zhx2-KOhep mice (Fig. 4e, f). More importantly, metformin not only decreased ATP levels, but also eliminated the difference in AMP and ATP levels and ATP/AMP ratios in Zhx2-KOhep and Zhx2-WT mice (Fig. 4g), suggesting that metformin dampens Zhx2 deficiency-accelerated liver repair by inhibiting ATP production.Fig. 4Metformin treatment inhibits OXPHOS activity and dampens augmented liver regeneration in Zhx2-KOhep mice.a, b Huh7 cells were transfected with siNC and siZHX2, following with metformin or vehicle treatment.

        "To further exclude the non-specific effect of metformin and confirm the role of ZHX2-mediated OXPHOS inhibition in injured liver repair, Zhx2-KOhep and Zhx2-WT mice were pre-exposed to carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), an uncoupler of mitochondrial OXPHOS33,35, following with 2/3 PHx (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Consistent with metformin treatment, FCCP treatment eliminated the differences in liver/body weight ratios, PCNA, Cyclin A2, Cyclin D1 expression, BrdU-positive cells, and ATP levels and ATP/AMP ratios in Zhx2-KOhep and Zhx2-WT mice after 2/3 PHx (Supplementary Fig. 4b–e). Taken together, these data demonstrate that ZHX2 inhibits liver repair by reducing OXPHOS.",
        "To investigate the mechanisms by which Zhx2 deficiency increases mitochondrial OXPHOS, we further analyzed the transcriptomic and proteomic data. As shown in Fig. 5a, Zhx2-KOhep increased hepatic expression of genes encoding mitochondrial complex I-V. Similarly, the heatmap of proteomic data showed the increased levels of ETC proteins in Zhx2-KOhep mice (Fig. 5b). In addition, mitochondria-located proteins also increase in Zhx2-KOhep mice liver (Supplementary Fig. 5a). RT-qPCR and western blot further confirmed the enhanced levels of ETC genes in liver tissues from Zhx2-KOhep mice 48 h after 2/3 PHx (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c). Furthermore, ZHX2 overexpression decreased the expression of ETC genes in Huh7 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5d), while knockdown down of ZHX2 increased the expression of ETC genes in human hepatic organoids (Fig. 5c). Above all, these data imply that ZHX2 regulates expression of ETC genes.Fig. 5ZHX2 transcriptionally represses ETC gene expression by binding to promoter regions.a, b Heatmap from RNA-seq data and proteomics data of Zhx2-KOhep and Zhx2-WT mice livers at 48 h after 2/3 PHx. a Heatmap based on mRNA levels of mitochondrial complexes genes. b Heatmap showed proteins levels related to energy metabolism.

        "Since ZHX2 has been identified as a transcriptional factor, we performed ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) with cell lysate of ZHX2-HA overexpressing Huh7 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5e). KEGG analysis showed that ZHX2-bound genes were enriched in OXPHOS pathway (Fig. 5d), which was in agreement with RNA-seq data showing enrichment of mitochondrial OXPHOS genes in Zhx2-KOhep mice livers (Fig. 3a). To identify the direct target of ZHX2, we performed a cluster analysis of sharing genes in OXPHOS pathway obtained from RNA-seq data and ChIP-seq data. As shown in Fig. 5e, six ETC genes were overlapped in both sequencing data, indicating that these genes are the potential targets of ZHX2. Interestingly, ChIP-seq data showed that these ETC genes contain a common ZHX2-binding motif (AGGCTGAG) in their 5’ UTR. And, this potential ZHX2-binding motif also presented at the promoters of previously reported ZHX2 targeted genes (Supplementary Fig. 5f). In accordance, ChIP assays performed with anti-HA confirmed the occupancy of ZHX2 in the promoter regions of four ETC genes in Huh7 cells (Fig. 5f). Co-transfection and dual luciferase assays showed that ZHX2 overexpression in Huh7 cells markedly inhibited the promoter activities of NDUFB9, SHDA, COX7C and UQCRC1, which contain the ZHX2-binding motif (Supplementary Fig. 5g). Furthermore, when three repeated putative ZHX2-binding motifs were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector, results of dual luciferase assays demonstrated that ZHX2 overexpression decreased the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5g). The interaction of ZHX2 with this motif was further illustrated by EMSA and pull-down assays using biotin-labeled ZHX2-binding motif as a probe. As shown in Fig. 5h, an increased gel shift was observed in ZHX2-overexpressing Huh7 cells (lane 3) as referred to that of control (lane 2). The shift was weakened by non-labeled probes as specific competitor in a dose-dependent way (lanes 4 and 5). Further pull-down assay confirmed the interaction of ZHX2 with the biotin-labeled motif (Supplementary Fig. 5h). Hence, these observations support that ZHX2 binds to the promoter region of these ETC genes for repression.",
        "Mitochondrial OXPHOS is controlled by nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins36. Since only a small subset of ETC genes contain ZHX2-binding motif, we therefore asked whether ZHX2 regulates mitochondrial OXPHOS activity through other intermediates. To address this, we screened the well-defined mitochondrial regulators, including PGC-1α, nuclear respiratory factor 1/2 (NRF1/2), and TFAM in RNA-seq data obtained from Zhx2-KOhep and Zhx2-WT livers after 2/3 PHx. Gene co-expression network analysis showed these factors in the central node of the ETC gene network (Supplementary Fig. 6a), in line with the critical roles of PGC-1α, NRF1/2 and TFAM in regulating mitochondrial functions37–39. Although ZHX2 had no significant effects on mRNA levels of NRF1, TFAM and PGC-1α (Supplementary Fig. 6b), ZHX2 overexpression largely decreased PGC-1α protein levels in Huh7 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6c). On the contrary, knockdown of endogenous ZHX2 increased PGC-1α protein levels in Huh7 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Similarly, overexpression of ZHX2 decreased while knockdown of ZHX2 enhanced PGC-1α protein levels in HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Importantly, liver-specific knockout of Zhx2 enhanced PGC-1α protein levels in murine liver tissues (Fig. 6a). Similarly, ZHX2 knockdown increased PGC-1α protein levels in human liver organoids (Fig. 6b). All the data imply that ZHX2 regulates PGC-1α at the protein level.Fig. 6ZHX2 promotes PGC-1α ubiquitination and degradation via FBXW7.a, b The expression of PGC-1α was detected in liver tissue from Zhx2-WT and Zhx2-KOhep mice at 48 h post 2/3 PHx (a) and human hepatic organoid with ZHX2 knockdown (b) by western blot.

        "To determine how ZHX2 reduces PGC-1α protein levels, stability of PGC-1α was monitored in Huh7 cells. ZHX2 overexpression decreased the half-life of PGC-1α (Fig. 6c). Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 but not the lysosome inhibitor CQ blocked PGC-1α reduction caused by ZHX2 overexpression in Huh7 cells (Fig. 6d), indicating that ZHX2 promotes proteasome-dependent degradation of PGC-1α. Consistently, results of in vitro ubiquitination assays showed that ZHX2 overexpression increased ubiquitination of PGC-1α in Huh7 cells in a ZHX2 level-dependent manner (Fig. 6e). Furthermore, GSEA analyses of RNA-Seq data revealed the enrichment of protein degradation genes sets in Zhx2-KOhep mice (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Heatmap showed the top E3 genes that were decreased in Zhx2-KOhep mice at 48 h after 2/3 PHx (Fig. 6f). Among them, FBXW7 is a reported E3 ligase targeting PGC-1α40. First, ZHX2-mediated downregulation of FBXW7 was validated at mRNA level in mice livers (Fig. 6g). Consistently, ZHX2 overexpression increased FBXW7 and ZHX2 knockout decreased FBXW7 at mRNA and protein levels in Huh7 and HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6f, g). Moreover, ZHX2 not only suppressed FBXW7 promoter activity but also occupied the FBXW7 promoter region (Supplementary Fig. 6h–j). Importantly, in vitro ubiquitination assay demonstrated that FBXW7 knockdown abolished the increased ubiquitination of PGC-1α caused by ZHX2 overexpression (Fig. 6h). These findings demonstrate that ZHX2 promotes PGC-1α degradation via FBXW7.",
        "To determine whether ZHX2 inhibits mitochondrial OXPHOS via PGC-1α, a series of mitochondrial functional assays were performed in Huh7 cells with PGC-1α interventions. The efficiency of ZHX2 and PGC-1α overexpression and/or knockdown were verified by western blot, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7a). As shown in Fig. 7a, b and Supplementary Fig. 7b, ZHX2 overexpression led to reduced mitochondrial mass and activity in Huh7 cells, and these reductions were reversed by PGC-1α overexpression, as evidenced by disrupted decreases in mtDNA content, mitochondrial mass, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Consistently, both seahorse assay (Fig. 7c) and Oxygraph-2k test (Supplementary Fig. 7c) demonstrated that ZHX2 reduced respiratory capacity of Huh7 cells, while PGC-1α co-transfection disrupted those differences. Reciprocally, ZHX2 knockdown increased the respiratory capacity of Huh7 cells, and this enhancement was greatly blocked by PGC-1α silence (Supplementary Fig. 7d). Also, ZHX2 knockdown elevated the mRNA levels of OXPHOS genes (NDUFA6, CYCS, ATP5G1 and ATP5G3), which were abolished by PGC-1α silencing (Fig. 7d). Collectively, all above results reveal that ZHX2 regulates mitochondrial OXPHOS via PGC-1α.Fig. 7Loss of ZHX2 promotes mitochondrial OXPHOS and liver repair via PGC-1α.a, b Mitochondrial mass was detected in Huh7 cells transfected with ZHX2 and/or PGC-1α by measuring mtDNA copy number (a) and intensity of Mito Tracker deep red (b).

        "To determine the role of PGC-1α in ZHX2-inhibited liver repair after acute damage, Zhx2-WT and Zhx2-KOhep mice were pretreated with PGC-1α inhibitor (SR18292), and were then subjected to 2/3 PHx (Fig. 7e). As shown in Fig. 7f, SR18292 administration almost completely abolished the difference of liver/body weight ratio between Zhx2-WT and Zhx2-KOhep mice.

In line with the evidence showing that ZHX2 suppressed OXPHOS during liver recovery, SR18292 treatment ameliorated the differences in ATP and AMP levels, and ATP/AMP ratios in Zhx2-KOhep and Zhx2-WT mice (Fig. 7i and Supplementary Fig. 7e). Above data Zhx2-KO accelerates damaged liver repair in PGC-1α-dependent manner.",
        "To investigate whether ZHX2 is associated with susceptibility to liver toxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction in human, expression of ZHX2 and TOM20, a widely used mitochondrial mass marker, were examined by multiplexed immunofluorescence staining in liver biopsies from DILI patients, normal non-tumor sections from patients with hepatic hemangioma as normal control (Fig. 8a and Supplementary Table 1). In line with studies reporting drug-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in DILI4,41, we detected decreased TOM20 in liver tissues from DILI patients (Fig. 8a–c). Notably, ZHX2 protein levels (fluorescence intensity) were higher in liver tissues from DILI patients than that of normal tissues, although ZHX2-positive cells were not significantly different in different groups (Fig. 8a, b). Furthermore, DILI patients were classified into two groups based on their pathological characters4. Interestingly, ZHX2 levels were higher and TOM20 levels were lower in liver tissues from patients with severe DILI than those with mild DILI (Fig. 8a–c). It is worth noting that ZHX2 expression was negatively associated with TOM20 intensity in liver biopsies from DILI patients (Fig. 8d), indicating that ZHX2 was negatively associated with mitochondrial mass. Similar results were obtained by staining mitochondria with another marker COX IV (Supplementary Fig. 7f). These data reveal a negative correlation between hepatic ZHX2 expression and drug-induced hepatic mitochondrial mass in human liver injury.Fig. 8ZHX2 expression is increased in human DILI and silencing ZHX2 accelerates liver recovery in mice with CCl4-induced injury.a–d Human samples from normal non-tumor sections of patients with hepatic hemangioma (Healthy) (n = 4) and from patients with drug-induced liver injury (DILI) (n = 27) were used for examination. a Representative H&E images and IF staining of ZHX2 and TOM20 of DILI patients and healthy donors were displayed.

        "The elevated ZHX2 in livers with DILI suggests ZHX2 as a therapeutic target. To evaluate the potential application of silencing ZHX2 in the repair of acutely damaged liver, we mimicked DILI by exposing mice to CCl4. Mice were injected with pSilencer-shZhx2 and control vectors before CCl4 exposure. Western blot confirmed the successful silence of hepatic Zhx2 mediated by shZhx2 injection (Fig. 8e). H&E results showed that the injured area of mice livers was obviously less in mice treated with shZhx2 than that of control mice (Fig. 8f). Consistently, the numbers of Ki67-positive cells were higher and the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were lower in mice liver with Zhx2 knockdown (Fig. 8g, h). Furthermore, the recovery of liver function was accelerated, displaying as the levels of serum ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, TBA and GGT were all significantly lower in Zhx2-knockdown mice than that of control mice (Fig. 8i). Above all, ZHX2 silencing contributes to augmented repair of mice liver after CCl4-induced acute injury.",
        "Acute liver injury, characterized by a rapid loss of functional hepatocytes, severely threatens human health. If not treated promptly, it can easily lead to liver failure, a lethal outcome that currently lacks effective treatment, within days or weeks42,43. Mitochondria provide energy for rapid proliferation of hepatocyte3. Therefore, identifying mitochondrial regulators and deep understanding their regulation on mitochondria may pave the way for the future development of therapeutic strategies in liver injury. Here, we found that Zhx2 loss in hepatocytes led to enhanced mitochondrial OXPHOS via PGC-1α dependent and independent manners, which contributes to accelerated repair of acute injured liver. Importantly, ZHX2 expression is negatively associated with mitochondrial marker TOM20 and COX IV in liver tissues from DILI patients. Previous research found that ZHX2 carried out its transcriptional activity upon reaching certain threshold44. Therefore, strategies aiming to manipulate ZHX2 may be a helpful strategy to enhance injured liver repair.",
        "ZHX2 was first identified as a ubiquitous transcription factor (TF) interacting with NF-YA45, and later studies have demonstrated the important roles of ZHX2 in different biological processes, including development, metabolism, and cancer24,46,47. Interestingly, ZHX2 works as a tumor suppressor in liver cancer and thyroid cancer24,48, but functions as an oncogene in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)49, which strongly suggests that ZHX2 takes effects in a context-dependent manner. Here, we clarified ZHX2 as a mitochondrial negative regulator in acute injured liver. Using in vitro, ex-in vivo and in vivo models, our data demonstrated that overexpression of ZHX2 reduced mitochondrial mass, membrane potential, OXPHOS. Reciprocally, knockdown or knockout ZHX2 increased mitochondrial activity displaying as above maintained parameters. Consistently, our previous work showed loss of Zhx2 enhanced lipid accumulation to promote NAFLD progression and increased mitochondria-mediated lipid oxidation to provide ATP for rapid hepatocytes proliferation during NAFLD-HCC transition27. Recently, Zhao et al. reported that deletion of Zhx2 augments NASH progression by enhancing PTEN-mTOR-dependent lipogenesis29. Since mitochondrial alterations play an important role in fatty liver dieases7, ZHX2-mediated OXPHOS regulation might also involve in NASH progression. However, mitochondrial oxidative capacity varies broadly across the spectrum of obesity and NAFLD7, and the role of mitochondrial in NASH progression is controversial. For instance, improving mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation can prevent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis progression50. On the contrary, hepatocyte-specific deletion of AIF indicated that the loss of mitochondrial OXPHOS protected against diet-induced steatosis and NASH progression10. Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction in humans is manifest as a variety of disorders with clinical outcomes largely dependent on the magnitude and tissue distribution of the impairment51,52. Therefore, the role of ZHX2-mediated OXPHOS regulation in metabolic liver diseases requires further studies. Nevertheless, ZHX2 is identified as a negative mitochondrial regulator, manipulation of which could be beneficial for therapy of acute liver injuries.",
        "Being a ubiquitous transcription factor, ZHX2 transcriptionally represses expression of many genes, such as AFP, GPC3 and H1922,25. Importantly, ZHX2 had been reported to transcriptionally repress expression of Cyclin A and E24, the well-known cell cycle regulators during liver regeneration. However, ZHX2-binding element on its target gene promoter is still unclear. Here, by integrated analyses of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, we identified a putative ZHX2-interacting consensus motif, which is in the 5’-UTR of some ETC genes. Both luciferase activity and ChIP-qPCR assays demonstrated that ZHX2 occupies on ETC gene promoters via this consensus motif, leading to transcriptional repression. Notably, EMSA and pull-down assays confirmed that ZHX2 binds to the biotin-labeled consensus motif. Previous reports showed that ZHX2 interacts with NF-YA or RelA/p65 to repress or promote gene expression45,49. To the best of our knowledge, the present work is identifying the direct binding motif of ZHX2. It is worth noting that the putative ZHX2-binding motif is also located in the previously reported ZHX2 target genes, such as Cyclin E and KDM2A, which are involved in liver cancer progression24,53. These findings could shed light on the research about the function of ZHX2 in genes transactional regulation.",
        "Another mechanism by which ZHX2 represses OXPHOS is that ZHX2 reduces PGC-1α protein levels by enhancing FBXW7 transcriptional activation, thereby limiting mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1α is dynamically regulated at the mRNA and protein levels in response to various signaling pathways involved in cellular growth, differentiation, and energy metabolism39,54. Previous report showed that PGC-1α is rapidly and dramatically induced at transcriptional level after hepatectomy55. However, its post-transcriptional regulation after hepatectomy is still unclear. Here, using protein half-life and ubiquitination assays, we demonstrated that ZHX2 regulates PGC-1α at protein levels. Importantly, FBXW7, an E3 ligase of PGC-1α, was transcriptionally upregulated by ZHX240. Extensive body of literature implicates that FBXW7 mediates ubiquitination and degradation of c-Myc56,57, which participates in the “priming” of hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy58. In addition, ZHX2 promotes PTEN transactivation to inhibit mTOR signaling and suppresses LPL to block exogenous lipids uptake29,46, which are also associated with mitochondrial activity. Thus, ZHX2 involves in the repair of acute liver injuries through complex pathways and signals. Nevertheless, based on our findings and previous reports, in Zhx2 knockdown or knockout mice, PGC-1α-dependent mitochondrial OXPHOS is the most significant changed pathways that contributes to accelerated liver recovery after acute injuries.",
        "In conclusion, our work identified ZHX2 as a regulator of mitochondria function that contributes to repair of injured livers. On one hand, ZHX2 transcriptionally represses ETC gene expression by binding to consensus motif in their promoter. On the other hand, ZHX2 destabilizes PGC-1α protein to reduce mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS. Thus, the present research has not only improved our understanding of ZHX2 biological activities, but also provides a potential strategy for treatment of acute liver injuries, such as DILI, and liver resection.",

    "title": "Histone phosphorylation integrates the hepatic glucagon-PKA-CREB gluconeogenesis program in response to fasting. via the CREB transcription factor. Here we uncovered a distinct function of this signal in directly stimulating histone phosphorylation for gluconeogenic gene regulation in mice. In the fasting state, CREB recruited activated PKA to regions near gluconeogenic genes, where PKA phosphorylated histone H3 serine 28 (H3S28ph). H3S28ph, recognized by 14-3-3zeta, promoted recruitment of RNA polymerase II and transcriptional stimulation of gluconeogenic genes. In contrast, in the fed state, more PP2A was found near gluconeogenic genes, which counteracted PKA by dephosphorylating H3S28ph and repressing transcription. Importantly, ectopic expression of phosphomimic H3S28 efficiently restored gluconeogenic gene expression when liver PKA or CREB was depleted. These results together highlight a different functional scheme in regulating gluconeogenesis by the glucagon-PKA-CREB-H3S28ph cascade, in which the hormone signal is transmitted to chromatin for rapid and efficient gluconeogenic gene activation. of Nutrition and Health, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.

        "A cell’s ability to detect various extracellular signals depends on the chemical nature of the signaling ligands and the permeability of the plasma membrane to polar compounds, such as polypeptides.1,2 This necessitates the production of two main types of signaling ligands and receptors. The first type, represented by growth factors, consists of polypeptides that generally cannot penetrate the cell membrane3–5; therefore, their receptors must present sophisticated extracellular binding domains. The second type of nuclear receptor ligand includes small, relatively hydrophobic molecules such as steroid hormones, vitamins, fatty acid derivatives, dexamethasone and enzalutamide.6 The hydrophobicity of these ligands allows them to pass through the cell membrane and reach the nucleus to bind to and activate nuclear DNA-binding proteins that then act as transcription factors.7",
        "Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a class of ligand-activated transcription factors that sense certain molecules, such as steroids, thyroid hormones and vitamins, to directly bind DNA and modulate gene expression, bypassing the need for cytoplasmic signal cascades that mediate surface receptor and nuclear transcription mechanisms.8–10 They are essential for numerous physiological processes, including development, metabolism, reproduction, and homeostasis. To date, 48 NRs have been identified in the human genome, and 49 have been identified in mice. The typical structure of a nuclear receptor consists of a hinge region, a conserved ligand-binding domain and a DNA-binding domain, which are surrounded by various N- and C-terminal domains.11 While some nuclear receptors are physically connected to chromatin, others remain in the cytoplasm until ligand interactions allow nuclear entry. These receptors bind to a DNA recognition sequence in or close to the promoters of the genes they control once they are attached to chromatin, either as homodimers or heterodimers.12,13 These recognition sequences are commonly called hormone response elements (HREs) and are composed of two hexanucleotide sequences separated by a variable number of spacer sequences.14 In addition, NRs can be indirectly recruited to the genome by tethering mechanisms by other DNA-bound transcription factors.15 Several posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation, have been reported to modulate the activities of NRs.16–19",
        "The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors influences the proliferation,20 differentiation21 and death22,23 of many different cell types, thereby playing important roles in the reproduction, development and physiology of metazoans.24–27 The characterization of the NR superfamily marked a significant turning point in the field of endocrine physiology by establishing common molecular pathways governing the development and physiology of various animal species. The dysregulation of these genes can lead to cardiovascular disease,28 cancer29 and diabetes.30 Research on NRs began in the mid-1980s when molecular cloning of several hormone receptors revealed their common structural framework.31 As a consequence of their central role in governing cell fate, NRs constitute targets for 15–20% of all pharmacologic drugs.32,33",
        "Drugs that target specific NRs are frequently employed to treat a wide range of illnesses. Tamoxifen and raloxifene, for example, target the estrogen receptor (ER) and are used to treat osteoporosis and breast cancer.34,35 Enzalutamide is used to treat prostate cancer by targeting the androgen receptor (AR),36,37 whereas thiazolidinediones are used to treat type 2 diabetes by targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ).38,39 Compounds with stronger binding affinities and better specificity are currently under development as new NR-targeted drugs because the available drugs often lack specificity and exhibit significant side effects, including severe heart failure.40,41 Thus, understanding the mechanism of NR gene selection and the development of specific inhibitors targeting NRs has become a pressing scientific issue in the field of biomedicine.",
        "In this review, we systematically introduce NRs and their members, structure, functions and regulatory signals. We summarize recent findings regarding the function of NRs in regulating physiology and pathology and the relevance of these receptors to clinical drug development. Emphasis is given to research on the targeting of these receptors for disease management, the preclinical and clinical testing and development of novel drugs and the techniques and strategies that facilitate targeting and therapeutic efficacy.",
        "The discovery of hormones dates back to the early 1900s42–45 (Fig. 1). In 1905, Ernest Starling coined the term ‘hormone’.44,45 In 1926, Tadeus Reichstein and Edward Calvin Kendall elucidated the structures of cortisone and thyroxine,46 while Adolf Butenandt and Edward Adelbert Doisy first isolated estrogen in 1929.47,48 became clear only after Elwood Jensen conducted a series of experiments in the late 1950s to determine how estrogen regulates reproductive organ maturation.49 The rise of molecular biology in the 1980s led to groundbreaking advances, including the cloning of the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the identification of the first estrogen receptor, ERα, from the ESR1 gene.50–52 In 1985, Ronald Evans successfully cloned the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR),50,51 while Pierre Chambon’s lab identified the first estrogen receptor, ERα, from the ESR1gene.52 They found that these receptors shared similarities with v-erbA, a viral oncogene recognized as a thyroid hormone receptor (TR) transcribed from the THRA gene. This discovery resulted in the placement of steroid and thyroid hormone receptors into a single grouping. A sequence comparison revealed a conserved evolutionary framework, highlighting structural and functional features that predicted the development of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Each receptor contains DNA-binding, ligand-binding, and transactivation domains. Soon after, receptors for other binding factors, such as retinoic acid and vitamin D, were cloned, confirming the existence of a receptor superfamily unified by structure. The formal establishment of the NR superfamily represented a major milestone, bolstering the hypothesis that the development and physiology of all animal species might be regulated by related molecular processes.Fig. 1Historical timeline of nuclear receptor expression. Schematic timeline illustrating key milestones in the nuclear receptor research field. The timeline begins with the cloning of the first steroid hormone receptor cDNA and highlights significant advancements, culminating in recent discoveries enabled by “omics” technologies.

        "The therapeutic potential of NRs was recognized in the 1970s when it was shown that the estrogen blocker tamoxifen could inhibit ER-dependent breast cancer cells.53,54 In prostate cancer, multiple nuclear receptors have been shown to inhibit tumor growth, proliferation, and metastasis, leading to significant interest in targeting these receptors as therapeutic strategies.55–57 Dysfunction of NRs has been associated with specific diseases, such as infertility, obesity, and diabetes.58 As key drug targets, NRs are crucial in studying the pathological mechanisms of metabolic diseases and related drug development. Today, they represent a huge family of pharmaceutically targetable proteins. This review discusses the current knowledge on NR-based therapeutic intervention in different types of disease.",
        "The known sequence of the human genome revealed that forty-eight human NRs detect ligands, such as hormones, and translocate them into the nucleus to function as transcription factors regulating gene expression.59 These receptors are classified into three main types on the basis of their ligand types or into eight subgroups on the basis of sequence homology.11,60 Type I receptors are steroid receptors, including the ER, AR, progesterone receptor (PR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and GR.61,62 Their ligands are steroid hormones such as sex hormones, glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.63 Type II receptors are nonsteroid receptors, such as thyroid hormones (TRα and TRβ), retinoic acid receptors (RARα, β), vitamin D receptors (VDRs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα, β and γ).64 Type III receptors include orphan receptors whose endogenous ligands are unknown or that do not bind to any ligands, such as the testicular receptor and germ cell nuclear factor.65 Alternatively, NRs can be divided into eight subgroups that are similar to classical receptors but differ enough individually, named thyroid hormone receptor-like family, retinoid X receptor-like family, estrogen receptor like family, nerve growth factor IB-like family, steroidogenic factor-like family, germ cell nuclear factor-like family, and those with two DNA-binding domains, as well as recently identified typically structured NR (CgNR8A1) in metazoans such as mollusks, annelids, cnidarians, echinoderms and hemichordates.66,67",
        "Except for the dose-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenital critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1 (DAX1) and the small heterodimer partner (SHP), all NRs are typically single-chain polypeptides that share four or five functional domains,68 including the N-terminal transcription activation domain (NTD), the DNA-binding domain (DBD), the ligand-binding domain (LBD), the C-terminal transcription activation domain (CTD) and a hinge domain (H) that connects the DBD and LBD (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Diagram of the structural model of nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors share four functional domains: the N-terminal transcription activation domain (NTD), the DNA binding domain (DBD), the ligand binding domain (LBD), and a hinge domain (H) that connects the DBD and LBD. Some NRs also contain a highly variable C-terminal transcription activation domain (CTD)",
        "Diagram of the structural model of nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors share four functional domains: the N-terminal transcription activation domain (NTD), the DNA binding domain (DBD), the ligand binding domain (LBD), and a hinge domain (H) that connects the DBD and LBD. Some NRs also contain a highly variable C-terminal transcription activation domain (CTD)",
        "The NTD, which is located at the N-terminus and comprises 25–603 amino acids (AAs), contains the first of two transactivation regions (AF-1) and possesses transcriptional activator functions.69,70 The A/B domain is intrinsically disordered, which makes obtaining full-length 3D representations of the receptor difficult.71,72 The second identified subunit is the DBD, with 66--68 AAs, including two zinc fingers, which are typically obscured because of lower DNA affinity when the hormone is absent.73–75 Once a hormone is bound, the zinc fingers dock the hormone–receptor complex to hexanucleotide response elements located within NR-regulated promoters that determine the receptor’s regulatory specificity. The DBD also serves as an intermolecular interaction site for receptor dimerization.76 The LBD is located at the receptor’s C-terminus and contains 220--250 AAs.77 The LBD binds to the cognate hormone or ligand through an interior binding pocket.78,79 It also has an AF-2 site for recruiting various coactivating proteins, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), to facilitate interactions with chromatin-remodeling proteins and the transactivation domain.80–82 The LBD plays a crucial role in mediating self-assembly reactions, such as dimerization or tetramerization, which are essential for high-affinity binding to DNA response elements.83 The DBD is connected to the LBD via a flexible domain, the ‘hinge’, which is related primarily to the nuclear localization signal of NRs and may influence the intracellular trafficking and subcellular distribution of the hormone‒receptor complex.84,85 The hinge region also contains a short NLS, and its phosphorylation is coupled to elevated transactivation.86,87",
        "However, not all NRs have all four typical domains. Members of the NR0 subfamily, for example, frequently have neither a DBD nor an LBD in their structures.88 Among these, NRs with only the LBD and no DBD, such as Dax-1 and SHP, are nonetheless capable of binding to other transcription factors (TFs) and suppressing the expression of genes downstream. Finally, some NRs also possess a short, highly variable C-terminal domain (CTD or F domain) that often has unknown functions.89,90 However, current research has revealed a critical function of the F domain in the ERα reaction to select ER modulators (SERMs), particularly in SERM-mediated LBD dimerization and AF-1 activity.91",
        "NRs were thought to have evolved approximately 600 million years ago in the common ancestor of bilaterian animals, enabling them to sense and respond to internal and external signals.92 This evolution likely involved genetic amplification and mutation, contributing to the functional diversity of the NR superfamily.93 Most NR ligands are small, hydrophobic molecules that pass through cell membranes, although some, such as thyroid hormones, are actively transported into cells.94 While NRs were initially termed ligand-binding proteins, it remains debated whether their common ancestor bound ligands or functioned as constitutively active receptors. Over 50% of NRs are orphan receptors lacking known ligands, although some have been shown to bind metabolites, suggesting a role in sensing metabolic changes.95,96 The evolution of the LBD enabled interactions with small molecules and coregulators, increasing NR versatility.97 Gene duplication during early metazoan evolution expanded and specialized the NR superfamily into subfamilies such as steroid hormone receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, and orphan receptors. The coevolution of NRs and their ligands increases their physiological complexity. For example, vertebrate NRs, such as glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors, have evolved high specificity for steroid hormones, which are crucial for the stress response and reproduction.98",
        "In 1992, a comparison of the DNA-binding domains of known NRs led to the construction of a phylogenetic tree, suggesting a common ancestor.99 By 1997, an alternative hypothesis emerged, suggesting that the original NR was an orphan receptor that gradually gained ligand-binding ability.100 The earliest NRs are believed to have evolved as orphan receptors that lack defined ligands and are involved in regulating fundamental processes such as metabolism and cellular signaling.101 Over time, orphan receptors adapt to regulate broader metabolic pathways, including lipid homeostasis and detoxification. A recent discovery of the NR7 subfamily has filled a critical gap in the understanding of the evolution of NR dimerization capabilities. Phylogenetically situated between class I NRs (monomers or homodimers) and class II NRs (heterodimers), the NR7 subfamily acts as a “missing link” in the transition from homodimerizing to heterodimerizing nuclear receptors.102",
        "Nuclear receptors can modulate gene expression through direct binding to target genes as well as through interactions with other NRs.103,104 The interplay between NR actions can be described at progressively more detailed levels, with various regulatory modes involved in upstream events that influence downstream gene transcription and crosstalk events at the DNA level that directly influence gene transcription.105 The existence or lack of physical connections between the relevant NRs could further alter the crosstalk mechanisms at the DNA level.",
        "Nuclear receptors can share overlapping arrays of target genes or regulate distinct genes that are part of the same downstream activity or pathway (Fig. 3). There is a wealth of experimental evidence to support endpoint modifications in gene expression that occur after NR crosstalk. The relationship between ERα and the PR was among the first observed examples of crosstalk between nuclear receptors.106 Estradiol-stimulated ERα activity was found to be suppressed by liganded PR isoforms, and the ligand, promoter and cell type were demonstrated to influence this suppressive crosstalk.106,107 Interactions between GRα and PPARα are critical in regulating shared subsets of target genes and different stages of signal transduction cascades involved in inflammatory and metabolic pathways.108,109 For example, both GRα and PPARγ have been shown to repress genes associated with TLR4- and TLR9-induced innate immune responses in primary peritoneal macrophages.110,111 However, there are significant differences in how these NRs achieve gene repression, which involves distinct transcriptional corepressor complexes. These variations in regulatory mechanisms highlight the complexity and specificity of gene regulation mediated by GRα and PPARγ in immune and metabolic contexts.Fig. 3Crosstalk modes of NR signaling. Various regulatory modes involved in NR signaling influence downstream gene transcription. For example, different types of nuclear receptor signaling can simultaneously regulate the expression of the same gene (Modes 1, 3 and 4) or regulate different genes belonging to the same pathway (Mode 2). Different nuclear receptors may share the same target genes (Mode 5). In addition, crosstalk between two NRs can influence each other’s gene or protein expression (Mode 6)",

Different nuclear receptors may share the same target genes (Mode 5). In addition, crosstalk between two NRs can influence each other’s gene or protein expression (Mode 6)",
        "More complex types of crosstalk, such as reciprocal or unidirectional regulation of the expression of NR genes or proteins and ligand availability, can sometimes occur.112,113 For example, glucocorticoid-activated GRα was reported to upregulate PPARα mRNA expression.109,114 Conversely, fenofibrate-activated PPARα was shown to downregulate GRα expression at the posttranscriptional level in a time- and dose-dependent manner.115,116 In rodent adipocytes, antidiabetic PPARγ ligands increase the expression of PEPCK-C mRNA, which encodes the key glyceroneogenic enzyme EC4.1.1.32.117 In contrast, dexamethasone-activated GRα counteracted this induction at the transcriptional level. These results show that the processes involved in NR crosstalk are not unique; different pairs of nuclear receptors can interact through distinct crosstalk mechanisms according to the stimulus, expression level, cell type, pathway and genes involved. It is probable that many other modes of crosstalk will be uncovered as our knowledge expands to include other intracellular organelles and the shuttling of NRs.",
        "At the DNA level, NR crosstalk can take two primary forms13,118 (Fig. 4). In one scenario, NRs physically interact to regulate specific target genes (direct crosstalk). In another context, NRs do not actually connect but still engage in unidirectional or bidirectional interactions (indirect crosstalk). When two nuclear receptors interact directly, they can bind to DNA sequences that are either closely positioned or farther apart. Alternatively, they can bind DNA sequences through the action of other transcription factors. A well-known example of this is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARs, which are of three types: PPARα, PPARβ/δ and PPARγ. Most of these proteins are heterodimers connected to retinoid X receptors (RXRs) that regulate gene transcription,119,120 but they can also be fine-tuned by pairing with a different ligand. Multiple coactivators can interact with heterodimer complexes to supplement and stabilize their activity in regulating lipid metabolism, adipogenesis and inflammation.121,122 Further instances of direct NR connections have been reported for steroid receptors. GRα and AR have many target genes in common due to the recognition of partial palindromic repeats of the sequence 5′-TGTTCT-3′.123 GRα–AR heterodimerization has been proposed as the mechanism underlying the mutual inhibition of the transcriptional activities of these two receptors, allowing for differential regulation of specific genes.124,125 Furthermore, AR and GR share significant similarities in the dimerization structure of their LBDs, which sheds new light on the previously reported structure of the GR LBD.126 The mechanisms of direct crosstalk may allow for dual NR ligand control, but the exact conditions for this process have not been determined. Context-specific influences, such as tissue or cell type and differentiation status, are likely to lead to different interaction patterns, resulting in varied biological responses.127,128Fig. 4Crosstalk modes at the DNA level. At the DNA level, nuclear receptors engage in crosstalk by indirectly or directly interacting with DNA. Part a outlines indirect regulation modes, where no physical interaction occurs, whereas Part b describes regulatory mechanisms involving direct physical interactions among nuclear receptors (NRs). Indirect regulation modes include: NR signaling pathways may compete for overlapping DNA-binding sites; NR heterodimer partners may cause redistribution or squelching; Components of the transcriptional machinery, such as RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and transcriptional coregulators, may cause redistribution or squelching; The alteration of shared coregulators can influence the activity of other NRs. One NR family member can act as a pioneering factor to facilitate chromatin loosening and enable the subsequent binding of other NRs. Direct physical interactions includes: Paired receptors may cooperate for direct DNA binding or through DNA looping; Direct crosstalk can occur with just one partner contacting the DNA; Two nuclear receptors engage in crosstalk through protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors (TFs); The sequestration of one or both NRs (originating from other modes, (f–i) away from the DNA due to heterodimer interactions",

        "In the absence of an actual connection, NR signaling pathways can indirectly influence crosstalk through several mechanisms.129–131 They may compete for overlapping DNA-binding sites by redistributing shared proteins or parts of the transcriptional machinery, such as RNA polymerase II or transcriptional coregulators; by regulating the expression of shared coregulators; and by acting as pioneering factors that loosen chromatin to facilitate the binding of additional NRs. For example, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) binds to estrogen-related receptor (ERR) target genes in heart tissue through ERR response element motifs via a histone deacetylase SIRT1-dependent mechanism.132 RXR, the PPAR partner, can trigger PPAR-independent activities on PPAR response element (RE)-controlled genes via RXR homodimerization, adding another layer of control to an intricate metabolic pathway.133 Members of the PPAR and ERR subfamilies can be further connected through shared coregulators, including PGC1α and PGC1β, as well as through common regulators such as low-energy-sensing AMP kinase.134,135 For example, during adipocyte differentiation and osteoclastogenesis, PGC1β, a coregulator that is upregulated by ERRα, can be recruited by PPARγ and other transcriptional regulators to enhance their adipogenic properties.136 Reduced PGC1β expression levels due to downregulation of ERRα resulted in decreased transcriptional activity of PPARγ. These reports provide evidence for the existence of complex combinations of indirect regulatory modes.",
        "The function of nuclear receptors can be achieved via genomic or nongenomic pathways (Fig. 5). Genomic mechanisms involve the direct regulation of gene expression through binding to DNA. This mechanism usually plays a critical role in long-term physiological processes, such as development, metabolism, and homeostasis. Nongenomic mechanisms involve rapid, transcription-independent actions of nuclear receptors. These processes occur within minutes and are crucial for swift cellular responses, such as ion channel modulation, cell migration, and acute stress responses.Fig. 5Nuclear receptors precisely regulate cell fate and metabolic processes. Nuclear receptors play crucial roles in regulating cell fate by influencing various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, senescence and apoptosis, by acting as transcription factors. Additionally, members of the nuclear receptor family control the synthesis rates of different metabolic enzymes across various tissues, affecting processes such as glucose, lipid and bile acid metabolism, as well as adipocyte differentiation and plasma lipoprotein modulation. By regulating the balance between the storage, utilization and production of these macromolecules, nuclear receptors ensure metabolic flexibility, enabling the organism to adapt to fluctuations in energy availability and demand",

        "Prior to binding to the specific DNA sequences of target genes known as hormone HREs to control transcription, NRs are typically in an inactive state and require activation through the binding of a cognate ligand.15,137 With many receptors, in the absence of ligands, molecular chaperone proteins such as heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and HSP70 anchor them in the cytoplasm in an inactive state.138 Upon ligand binding, the NR undergoes a conformational shift that causes it to separate from the heat shock protein and become active.139 This allows the hormone–receptor complex to translocate into the cell nucleus after its nuclear localization sequence (NLS) has been revealed.140,141 Once inside, the complex binds to a specific sequence in the target gene known as an HRE to regulate its transcription. In addition to detaching the HSPs, ligand binding can promote receptor phosphorylation, which further enhances the ability of the receptor to bind to HREs.142 In general, NRs undergo a change from a non-DNA-binding form to a DNA-binding form upon activation, but some types, such as thyroid hormone receptors, retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors, are retained in the nucleus regardless of their ligand binding status.143 They are already bound to HREs but complex with corepressor proteins, which makes them transcriptionally inactive.144,145 However, upon receiving ligand activation signals, the corepressor dissociates, and coactivator proteins are recruited. The NR/DNA complex then enlists more proteins, such as RNA polymerase, to aid in the transcription of DNA into mRNA.146–148",
        "Nuclear receptors can directly bind DNA via three different modes, namely, homodimers, heterodimers, or monomers, depending on the type of NR.13 For example, glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) bind to HREs after forming homodimers.149,150 In contrast, retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγ) binds as a monomer to the DNA response region to control gene transcription and expression.151,152 The retinoid X receptor (RXR) can either bind to itself as a homodimer or pair with other nuclear receptors as a heterodimer to activate downstream gene transcription.153–155 To make this process even more complicated, some NRs can form nonclassical heterodimers, which are only activated by outside ligands. Thus, unanticipated adverse effects could appear when developing therapeutics because NRs can operate through nonclassical routes.156–159",
        "The identification of coregulatory proteins that interact with and control the transcriptional action of NRs in the mid-1990s was another pivotal development in our knowledge of the mechanism of action of NRs.160,161 These coregulators have a variety of functions, such as chromatin remodeling, which modifies the target gene’s transcriptional accessibility, or bridging, which maintains the binding of other coregulatory proteins.162 The intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of coactivator proteins can promote gene transcription by reducing the affinity of histones for DNA.163 On the other hand, the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) by corepressor proteins increases the number of bonds between histones and DNA and suppresses gene transcription.164 These coactivators or corepressors enable nuclear receptors to function as inducible scaffolds that coordinate large transcriptional complexes, allowing different ligands to induce distinct receptor conformations.163,165 These changes could expose specific protein–protein interaction surfaces, making them available for coregulator binding. This hypothesis provides an explanation for how structurally different ligands, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators, could influence multiple genes in the same cell via the same receptor or how they could jointly regulate the expression of a single gene. Depending on the tissue-specific location of coregulators, the same ligand can also control specific genes in different tissues or at different developmental stages.166,167 Nuclear receptor/coregulator complexes that alter chromatin shape and DNA accessibility are produced by receptor-bound coregulators, which can also directly interact with the core RNA polymerase through their enzyme action. In addition, there is no set link between two distinct nuclear receptors, as they can change depending on the target genes and tissues that are engaged. Transcriptional regulation by NRs can be affected by epigenetic variables such as chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation and histone modification.168,169",
        "In addition to acting as transcription factors in the nucleus to regulate target gene expression (genomic function), NRs can also operate through a molecular mechanism independent of transcriptional activity (nongenomic function)170–172 (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). This nongenomic role requires NRs to be localized to specific subcellular structures,173–175 where they directly interact with various intracellular proteins to rapidly regulate cellular stress responses and signal transduction pathways. Their subcellular translocation can occur either by alternative splicing or posttranslational modifications through free shuttling or with the assistance of other proteins.176,177 As an example, the plasma membrane is home to a truncated variant of the thyroid hormone receptor. This localization enables them to participate in several biological processes, including the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, apoptosis, autophagy, fatty acid oxidation within mitochondria and the regulation of centrosome homeostasis and cell mitosis. Nongenomic NR signaling frequently involves phosphorylation cascades mediated through pathways associated with AMPK, cAMP/PKA, PI3K/AKT, and Hippo/Yap and signaling via Wnt/β-catenin and MAPK.178–183Fig. 6Platelets are good models for investigating the possible nongenomic impacts of nuclear receptors. Because of their anucleate origin, well-characterized mechanisms, and quick reactions, platelets offer a model system for examining any non-genomic impacts of the NRs. Non-genomic roles of NRs include controlling intracellular calcium levels, ion channel function, kinase and phosphatase activity, and second messenger synthesis. It has been discovered that human platelets contain a number of NRs, and that certain NR agonists have anti-platelet actions through a range of mechanisms",

        "Several NRs have been found to propagate rapid nongenomic effects for cellular protection in addition to their defined genomic effects. Their nongenomic functions operate through the control of kinase/phosphatase activity,184,185 intracellular calcium levels,186,187 ion channel function188,189 and the production of second messengers.190 Accumulating data indicate that RXRα also possesses extranuclear nongenomic functions. Previous studies have demonstrated that RXRα engages in some nongenomic activities through the creation of heterodimers with Nur77.191 In response to specific apoptotic stimuli, RXRα-Nur77 heterodimers are translocated from the nucleus to the mitochondria, where they regulate apoptosis.192 Recent research has shown that truncated RXRα (tRXRα) has an important function in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, where it interacts with the p85α subunit to increase AKT activation and promote cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo.193,194 Notably, glucocorticoids (GCs) manifested nearly instantaneous nongenomic effects through nonspecific interactions with cell membranes and targeted interactions with cytosolic GRs (cGRs) or membrane-bound GRs (mGRs).124,195,196 This rapid nongenomic action of GCs could also contribute to their anti-inflammatory effects through prolonged genomic processes, particularly in managing inflammatory diseases (Fig. 6).197,198 For example, recent studies revealed that GCs quickly enhanced the effects of bronchodilators used to treat allergic asthma.199 Other NRs, including PPARα, LXR and FXR, have also been reported to perform nongenomic functions.189,191,200 The possibility of turning NR ligands into effective medicines should be explored through the characterization of these extragenomic processes and the discovery of new binding partners and pathways in addition to their known genomic effects.",
        "Platelets are useful models for investigating the potential nongenomic effects of NRs because they lack nuclei and possess well-characterized reactions.189,201 ERβ, but not ERα, is known to be expressed on human platelets and to affect their function.202 In addition, some studies have shown that platelets isolated from male rats exhibit a stronger aggregation response than those from female rats do, likely due to an increase in androgenic steroids.203,204 This conclusion was supported by findings that castration reduced platelet aggregation in male rats,205 an effect that was reversed with testosterone treatment.206 LXR and FXR ligands negatively regulate platelet function by inhibiting platelet signaling and the formation of procoagulant-coated platelets.207–210 For example, LXR ligands induce a procoagulant state in platelets, which is marked by the exposure of phosphatidylserine and α-granule contents on the surface of the platelet, coupled with mitochondrial membrane depolarization, reduced calcium mobilization and decreased affinity of integrin αIIbβ3, which ultimately inhibits platelet aggregation.209,211 Similarly, FXR ligands can cause platelet swelling and transformation into procoagulant-coated platelets, a process dependent on cyclophilin D activity.212 FXR ligands also increased cGMP levels, which increased PKG activity and VASP S239 phosphorylation, further suppressing platelet activation.189 Other studies have identified PPARα as a key mediator of the antiplatelet effects of statins and fenofibrate.213 Treating platelets with PPARα ligands, such as fenofibrate or statins (e.g., simvastatin), inhibited ADP-stimulated platelet activation by increasing intracellular cAMP levels through a PPARα-dependent mechanism.214 This role of PPARα was further confirmed by experiments showing that fenofibrate-induced inhibition of platelet activation and prolonged bleeding time were absent in PPARα-deficient mice215; the reversion of this inhibitory effect by the PPARα antagonist GW6471 further highlighted its dependence on PPARα.",
        "Subsequent studies revealed the unexpected presence of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) in the cytosol of Sertoli cells, hepatic stellate cells and neurons.216–218 In Sertoli cells, RARα was found to be a substrate for small ubiquitin-like modifier-2 (SUMO-2), and its cytosolic or nuclear localization was influenced by a dynamic process of sumoylation and desumoylation.219,220 Additionally, in Sertoli and hepatic stellate cells, RARα is retained in the cytosol through interactions with the cytoplasmic adaptor for RAR and TR (CART1) protein or with cytoskeletal proteins that sequester the receptor outside the nucleus.144 Furthermore, in hippocampal neurons, independent studies have shown that RARα is exported to dendritic RNA granules, where it is associated with a specific subset of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins.221–223 Interestingly, in response to retinoic acid (RA), this extranuclear pool of RARα rapidly initiates the local translation of the postsynaptic glutamate receptor GluR1, leading to an increase in synaptic strength.224,225 In light of this growing body of knowledge, understanding these nongenomic mechanisms can lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies that exploit the rapid and diverse roles of nuclear receptors outside of their traditional genomic functions. By targeting the nongenomic pathways of nuclear receptors, it may be possible to create drugs with faster onset times and more specific effects, thereby increasing the efficacy of treatments for various diseases.",
        "Nuclear receptors are of key importance in physiology and pathology because they regulate multiple cellular functions (Fig. 5). For example, NHR-6, the only NR4A-type nuclear receptor in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, has been implicated in the development of the nervous system.226 During development, the nervous system produces highly specialized neurons with distinct functional characteristics. A prime example is the C. elegans BAG chemosensory neurons.227 Under certain circumstances, BAG neurons sense the concentration of carbon dioxide in respiratory gas and translate it into reactions of attraction or repulsion; ETS-5 and its target gene NHR-6 are essential for this process.228 In contrast to ETS-5, which is engaged in both the attraction and avoidance of carbon dioxide, NHR-6 is an NR that is exclusively involved in the attraction process.229 These findings imply that gene regulatory mechanisms supported by NR subtypes have undergone evolutionary conservation. NHR-6 is necessary for BAGs to exhibit exceptional capacity to adaptively assign positive or negative valences to chemosensory stimuli, and it is a key modulator of the functional plasticity of the neural system.226 It is clear that NRs are of the greatest importance for the proper functioning of numerous processes in cellular lipid metabolism,230,231 energy homeostasis232 and the inflammatory response233; cell proliferation and differentiation are critically dependent on nuclear receptors.",
        "Pathological changes in nuclear receptors, such as mutations, altered expression levels, or dysregulated activity, are linked to a wide range of diseases, including cancer, metabolic disorders, inflammation, and cardiovascular conditions. For example, the overexpression of ER in breast cancer drives tumor growth,234 whereas aberrant AR can cause therapy resistance in prostate cancer.235 Impaired PPAR function is associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes,236 whereas dysregulated liver X receptors (LXRs) disrupt cholesterol homeostasis, exacerbating cardiovascular disease.237 Aberrant GR activity exacerbates inflammatory conditions and may induce corticosteroid resistance. Altered retinoid X receptor (RXR) function has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. These pathological changes not only hold diagnostic and prognostic value but also serve as therapeutic targets. For example, ER, PR, and HER2 expression levels guide breast cancer classification and treatment, with SERMs such as tamoxifen proving effective in ER-positive patients. AR inhibitors are crucial in prostate cancer, where AR expression levels and mutations influence therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, radiolabeled ligands such as [F-18]-estradiol enable imaging of ER-positive tumors via PET scans,238 aiding in diagnosis and treatment monitoring. In summary, nuclear receptor alterations play a dual role in clinical practice as both therapeutic targets and biomarkers, underscoring their critical contribution to precision medicine and improved patient outcomes.",
        "Nuclear receptors are essential for regulating cell fate through their function as transcription factors with effects on proliferation,239 differentiation,240 senescence241 and apoptosis.242 Through nongenomic mechanisms, NRs modulate signaling pathways that determine whether a cell will continue to divide, differentiate into a specific cell type, or undergo programmed cell death.243",
        "The ER has been the most studied ER, mainly because of the estrogen dependence of the growth of certain breast cancer cells. The function of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα/ER) defines the most common type of breast cancer.244,245 Numerous associated elements that function as regulators of estrogen-driven transcriptional pathways have been discovered, indicating that the ER cannot function solely by itself.246 Enhancer sequences are cis-regulatory ER binding sites that are located mainly away from transcriptional start sites, according to genome-wide profiling of chromatin binding.247 There is growing evidence that global enhancer activation is involved in tumor aneuploidy and carcinogenesis.248 Short DNA enhancer elements are crucial for maintaining a coordinated gene expression program specific to cell types during development and differentiation.249 Other nuclear receptor ligands, such as all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and 1,25(OH)2D3, induce cell differentiation.250–252 RA, the primary bioactive metabolite of retinol (vit A), has a range of pleiotropic effects on cell growth and differentiation, which are important in adult physiology and embryonic development.253 Members of the NR class of transactivators, specifically the retinoic acid receptors RARα, RARβ and RARγ, are the main mediators of activity.254 For example, prostate cancer-induced bone formation is decreased, and the endothelial-to-osteoblast transition (EC-to-OSB) is inhibited when the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) is activated.255,256 Treatment with the RARγ agonist palovarotene, which has been tested for heterotopic ossification in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, inhibited osteoblast mineralization and the EC-to-OSB transition in vitro. It also reduces the growth and formation of tumor-induced bone in several models of osteogenic prostate cancer.255 Compared with mature hepatocytes, hepatocytes induced in a 3D environment exhibited lower activity of the nuclear receptor THRB. The addition of THRB ligands during differentiation upregulated not only the expression of CYP3A4 but also the expression of multiple hepatocyte-related genes and increased histone acetylation; the induced differentiated hepatocytes were more similar to mature hepatocytes.21 In addition, the nuclear receptor Nur77 regulates the expression of genes involved in fatty acid absorption and transport, thereby blocking the uptake of exogenous fatty acids by cells and inhibiting the signaling pathways that promote breast cancer cell proliferation.27 These findings highlight the significant role of NRs in controlling cell growth and differentiation.",
        "NRs have also been shown to be involved in cellular senescence and cell death processes. Three members of the NR4A1/Nur77/NGFIB orphan nuclear hormone receptor subfamily (NR4A1, NR4A2 and NR4A3) have been the most studied. NR4A2 was reported to maintain anchorage-independent growth, thereby reducing cell death, known as anoikis, in HeLa cells.257 Following acute kidney injury (AKI), Nur77 and its family members Nurr1 and Nor-1 stimulate epithelial apoptosis. A conformational shift in Bcl2 and an increase in proapoptotic Bcl-xS protein levels are involved in Nur77-mediated kidney damage.258 Furthermore, YAP controls the transcription, phosphorylation and mitochondrial localization of NR4A1 to mediate the proapoptotic and antitumor actions of the Hippo pathway. In turn, NR4A1 acts as a feedback inhibitor of YAP, leading to its destruction, which prevents YAP from participating in carcinogenesis and liver regeneration.259 In addition, Nur77 interacts with DNMT3b, increasing GLS1 promoter methylation and decreasing GLS1 expression and glutaminolysis, which leads to the induction of HSC senescence.260 Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α, NR2A1), another strongly conserved NR superfamily member, suppresses prostate tumorigenesis by arresting the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and p21-driven cell senescence.261 NR subfamily 1 group I member 2 (NR1I2), also called PXR (pregnane-X receptor) or PAR (pregnane-activated receptor), has been implicated in blunting the expression of the proapoptotic genes TP53 and BAK1 (BCL2 antagonist/killer 1) to prevent apoptosis from toxic bile acids.262 The retinoid RXRα has been shown to suppress the production of ITPR2 and control calcium signaling via ITPR2 and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). After reducing the degree of DNA damage, the overexpression of RXRα delays replicative senescence.263 ZBTB17, a zinc finger protein, was shown in another study to interact with RXRα. Notably, ZBTB17 knockdown initiates a series of events, including DNA damage, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), RXRα-dependent intracellular calcium signaling and cellular senescence.264 Under metabolic and genotoxic stresses, LXR/CD38 activation promoted lysosomal cholesterol efflux and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) depletion in macrophages, which caused cholesterol-induced macrophage senescence and neurodegeneration.265",
        "Members of the NR family control the pace at which different metabolic enzymes are synthesized in different tissues,266 which affects processes including the metabolism of glucose, lipids and bile acids; adipocyte differentiation; and plasma lipoprotein modulation.267,268 By influencing the balance between the storage, utilization and production of these macromolecules, NRs ensure metabolic flexibility, allowing the organism to adapt to fluctuations in energy availability and demand (Fig. 7). Their regulatory functions are particularly critical during periods of fasting, stress, or increased physical activity, where their precise control is essential for maintaining overall metabolic health.Fig. 7Examples of nuclear receptors involved in regulating metabolic pathways. Cellular metabolic pathways provide the energy and materials essential for cell survival. Nuclear receptors transcriptionally regulate genes that encode nutrient transporters and metabolic enzymes involved in these processes. The pathways include the following: 1. Glycolysis, 2. Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), 3. Gluconeogenesis, 4. Lactate oxidation, 5. Autophagy, 6. Amino acid catabolism, 7. Redox homeostasis, 8. Mitochondrial biogenesis/dynamics, 9. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), 10. Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, 11. Ketogenesis/ketolysis, 12. Glutaminolysis, 13. Ca2+ homeostasis, 14. Fatty acid oxidation (FAO), 15. Lipolysis",

        "Glucose is the primary metabolic fuel for mammals and plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis.269,270 During the fed state, circulating glucose originates primarily from the absorption of nutrients in the intestines.271 However, under fasting or energy-demanding conditions, the body relies on two additional sources to maintain glucose levels: the breakdown of stored glycogen through glycogenolysis and the production of new glucose molecules via gluconeogenesis.272–274 These complex metabolic processes are intricately regulated, and NRs play a key role in coordinating them. As molecular sensors, NRs detect changes in the body’s energy status and modulate the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism.275,276 The activation of PXR by its ligand, pregnenolone-16α-carbonitrile (PCN), impaired glucose tolerance by dysregulating glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) function through two distinct mechanisms.277 First, it reduced the expression of GLUT2 in both mouse liver and wild-type hepatocytes. Second, it triggers the transport of GLUT2 from the plasma membrane to the cytosol in the liver, thereby suppressing glucose uptake in primary hepatocytes. Additionally, data mining of published chromatin immunoprecipitation/sequencing results revealed that the Glut2 gene is directly targeted by PXR. These findings may explain the diabetogenic effects of certain medications and environmental contaminants, positioning PXR in a potential novel diabetogenic pathway. At physiological concentrations found in the liver, glucose binds to and activates the transcriptional activity of LXRs, inducing the expression of LXR target genes with similar efficacy to that of oxysterols, which are well-known LXR ligands. Cholesterol homeostasis genes, which depend on LXR for their expression, were upregulated in the liver and intestines of fasted mice after refeeding with a glucose-rich diet,278 suggesting that glucose acted as an endogenous ligand for LXR.",
        "Nuclear orphan receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1), an important regulator of hepatic glucose homeostasis, was found to interact with the nuclear glycerol kinase Gyk during hepatic gluconeogenesis in the unfed state and in diabetes. Gyk acts as a corepressor of NR4A1, which attenuates the expression of target genes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis and obstructs blood glucose regulation.279 Nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 2 (NR5A2 or LRH1) and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1 or NR5A1) work synergistically as key regulators of glucose-sensing systems in hepatic and steroidogenic tissues.280 These receptors are essential for the normal processing of glucose after eating through direct control of GCK and HK1 transcription.281 FXR combines signals from PKA and FOXA2 for hepatic glucose metabolism and production through two regulatory arms.282 The first is the phosphorylation of FXR by protein kinase A, which induces glucagon, agonist-activated FXR and CREB to combine and activate gluconeogenic genes. The physical interaction between FXR and the glucagon-activated FOXA2 transcription factor constitutes the second arm, which prevents FXR from stimulating the anti-gluconeogenic nuclear receptor SHP. Foxa2 knockdown did not influence the expression of glucagon-induced or FXR agonist-boosted gluconeogenic genes, suggesting that distinct subsets of FXR-sensitive genes are controlled by the PKA and FOXA2 pathways.282",
        "NR coregulators play crucial roles in the regulation of glucose metabolism. For example, NR corepressors (NCoRs) operate within multiprotein complexes containing histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to inhibit transcription, primarily through repressive chromatin remodeling at target loci. This process ultimately drives glucocorticoid receptor-dependent activation of hepatic gluconeogenesis. In hepatocytes, the double knockout of both NCoR1 and NCoR2 mimicked the hepatomegaly and fatty liver phenotype observed in HDAC3 knockouts by preventing glucocorticoid receptor binding.283 Similarly, nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (NCOA3) regulates the transcription of tyrosine-protein kinase (Fyn) in a PPARγ-dependent manner. NCOA3 deficiency was shown to worsen diabetic kidney disease by exacerbating albuminuria, glomerular sclerosis, and podocyte injury and impairing autophagy.284",
        "Increasing evidence suggests that NRs play critical roles not only in glucose metabolism but also in the regulation of sterol, bile acid and lipid metabolism.285–287 The three ERR isoforms, as well as PPARα and PPARδ, are the main transactivators of genes involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and are viewed as primary controllers of mitochondrial FAO.288,289 For example, in addition to being a regulator of mitochondrial function, ERRα was established as a major transcriptional regulator of lipid biosynthesis and a promoter of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD/NASH).290 Medium-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADM), the first-discovered target gene of ERRα, encodes the initial rate-limiting enzyme in mitochondrial FAO; the promoter is also targeted by PPARα.291 In addition, a muscle-specific protein induced by PGC-1 and ERRs, PERM1 (PGC-1/ERR-induced regulator in muscle-1), promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism in cardiomyocytes. In this study, PERM1 was shown to interact with the proximal regions of PPAR response elements (PPREs) in the endogenous promoters of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, and further results revealed that PERM1 interacted with PPRE to promote transcription, partly in a PPARα- and PGC-1α-dependent manner.292",
        "PPARα is also a key regulator of fatty acid oxidation and can induce spontaneous fatty liver and hyperlipidemia in mice fed a standard diet. For example, during the early night, fasting mice exhibited acute PPARα-dependent hepatocyte activity, accompanied by increased circulating free fatty acids that could be further stimulated by adipocyte lipolysis. However, fasting resulted in mild hypoglycemia and hypothermia in PPARαhep−/− mice, suggesting a role of PPARα activity in nonhepatic tissues.293 Liver-specific inactivation of Vps15, the essential regulatory subunit of class 3 PI3K, elicited mitochondrial depletion and failure to oxidize fatty acids through blunting of the transcriptional activity of PPARα. Vps15 deficiency led to the accumulation of the PPARα repressors HDAC3 and nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) in the liver due to disrupted autophagy. Activation of PPARα or inhibition of HDAC3 restored mitochondrial biogenesis and FAO in Vps15-deficient hepatocytes, revealing functions for class 3 PI3K and autophagy in the transcriptional coordination of mitochondrial metabolism.294 In addition, hepatic Ncor1 deletion in mice retarded atherosclerosis development by reprogramming bile acid metabolism and enhancing fecal cholesterol excretion, resulting in reduced plasma cholesterol levels and decreased hepatic cholesterol content in liver-specific Ncor1 knockout mice compared with those in controls fed an atherogenic diet for twelve weeks.295",
        "NR4A1 was identified as a previously unrecognized constitutive regulator of adipocyte progenitor (AP) quiescence.296 In ex vivo experiments, NR4A1 gain-of-function reduced adipogenesis, whereas its loss-of-function increased adipogenesis.296 Compared with control mice, NR4A1 knockout mice fed a high-fat diet were more prone to obesity, with increased gene expression of PPARγ and FAS. Conversely, NR4A1 overexpression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes inhibited adipogenesis. NR4A1 upregulated GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2), which in turn inhibited PPARγ. NR4A1 also suppressed sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its downstream target fatty acid synthase (FAS) by upregulating p53. Overall, NR4A1 inhibits adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation by increasing the expression of GATA2 and p53.297 Nuclear receptor subfamily 0 group B member 2 (NR0B2, also called SHP) is expressed at high levels in the liver and intestine, and its transcriptional activity can be increased by fibroblast growth factor 19 (human FGF19, mouse FGF15) signaling. FGF19 and SHP were observed to inhibit SREBF2 (sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2), which led to a reduction in intestinal NPC1L1 expression, cholesterol absorption and hypercholesterolemia.298 Another member of the nuclear receptor family, NR1A1, was reported to influence hepatic autophagy, lipid metabolism and adipocyte homeostasis by interacting with MED1 through a bridge formed by PGC1α.299,300",
        "The expression of RORα/β/γ and REV-ERBα/β in the liver follows circadian rhythms. The liver genome contains high-order transcriptionally repressive hubs where REV-ERBα condensates are found, and these hubs are strongly associated with circadian gene repression.301–303 In mouse models, RORs bind to ROREs at night, whereas REV-ERBα/β bind to ROREs during the day to decrease lipogenesis. In the liver, REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ work in concert, increasing the ability of HDAC3 and NCoR to control SREBP activity and maintain lipid homeostasis. They also affect cytochrome P4507A1 expression levels, which helps to maintain the equilibrium of bile acid metabolism.304 RORγ serves as a crucial activator of the entire cholesterol biosynthesis program, controlling SREBP2 by binding to genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and facilitating SREBP2 recruitment. At the loci of genes involved in cholesterol production, RORγ inhibition decreases chromatin acetylation and disrupts its connection with SREBP2. In immunocompetent animals and patient-derived xenografts, RORγ antagonists induce tumor regression.305",
        "The regulation of bile acids, sterols and lipids is also associated with many other types of nuclear receptors. Through the regulation of Akr1b7 transcription, the nuclear receptor PXR effectively reduces AKI by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in lipid metabolism.306 It was recently demonstrated that the function of FXR in BA homeostasis depends on the phosphorylation of Tyr-67 by the FGF15/19 signaling-activated nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src. According to Byun and colleagues, hepatic FXR phosphorylation by FGF15/19-induced Src preserves cholesterol homeostasis and protects against atherosclerosis.307 PXR activation upregulated intermediates in the Kandutsch–Russell cholesterol synthesis pathway in the liver and induced a number of cholesterol synthesis genes, including the rate-limiting HMRCR. In both mice and humans, PXR activation increased the level of plasma proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a negative regulator of hepatic LDL absorption. A new regulator of PCSK9 and cholesterol synthesis, the PXR-SREBP2 pathway, also serves as a molecular mechanism for drug- and chemical-induced hypercholesterolemia.308",
        "Mitochondria serve as vital energetic and biosynthetic signaling hubs, taking in substrates from the cytoplasm to generate bioenergetic and biosynthetic building blocks.309 This process is achieved through the coordinated activity of several key metabolic pathways, including the electron transport chain (ETC), oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycolysis, glutaminolysis and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). These pathways not only produce ATP but also provide intermediates essential for biosynthesis. Crucially, the function of mitochondria is tightly regulated by various nuclear receptors, which modulate gene expression to ensure proper mitochondrial activity and metabolic balance.",
        "Several nuclear receptors are involved in regulating genes associated with the TCA cycle and OxPhos, including estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), NUR77 (NR6A1) and PPARγ.310–312 One of the first major datasets used to highlight the role of ERRα in OxPhos regulation was a study that integrated PGC1α-induced GW transcriptional profiling with a software approach to identify cis-regulatory sequences.313,314 Mice lacking both ERRα and ERRγ presented the most extensive and profound disruption in skeletal muscle gene expression, with the ‘mitochondrial function’ pathway genes involved in OxPhos and the TCA cycle being the most significantly affected. Moreover, mice deficient in ERRβ and ERRγ exhibit impairments in lipid metabolism and branched-chain amino acid metabolism, specifically in the soleus muscle.315 Similarly, muscle-specific deletion of Esrrg (the gene encoding ERRγ) in mice reduces exercise capacity because of deficient mitochondrial activity.316 adipocytes lacking all ERR isoforms exhibited significant downregulation of genes involved in oxidative metabolic pathways, including those controlling the TCA cycle and OxPhos, leading to marked reductions in mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity.317 These results suggest that many mitochondrial actions are mediated through the stimulation of ERR expression and activity, underscoring the critical role of ERR in mitochondrial energy metabolism across various tissues.",
        "The nuclear receptor Nur77 (also known as TR3 or NGFI-B), encoded by Nr4a1, belongs to the steroid/thyroid/retinoid superfamily and serves as a key regulator of energy metabolism. Nur77 is phosphorylated by ERK2 and translocated to the mitochondria upon glucose deprivation. Mitochondrial Nur77 binds to TPβ, a rate-limiting enzyme in FAO, to protect it from oxidation. This promoted the metabolic adaptation of melanoma cells by evading ROS-induced cell death.318 Ubiquitinated mitochondrial Nur77 interacts with the ubiquitin-binding domain of p62/SQSTM1 to form condensates capable of sequestering damaged mitochondria. An additional interaction between the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of Nur77 and the N-terminal PB1 domain of p62/SQSTM1 allows tethering of clustered mitochondria to the autophagy machinery, which endows Nur77-p62/SQSTM1 condensates with the magnitude and liquidity to act on the mitochondria.319 In response to the pathological accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils in Parkinson’s disease (PD), Nur77 is translocated from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria to improve PHB-mediated mitophagy by regulating c-Abl phosphorylation. Nur77 overexpression alleviated the expression of pS129-α-syn and protected dopamine (DA) neurons from the loss of α-syn in PD.320",
        "NR1D1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1) is the most highly upregulated nuclear receptor in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) tissues. Knockout of Nr1d1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), but not in endothelial or myeloid cells, led to significant inhibition of AAA formation. Mechanistic investigations revealed that ACO2 (aconitase-2), a key enzyme in the TCA cycle, is a direct transcriptional target of NR1D1. By repressing ACO2, NR1D1 modulates mitochondrial metabolism. In the absence of NR1D1, ACO2 expression is restored, which subsequently corrects mitochondrial dysfunction during the early stages of Ang II infusion, even prior to the onset of AAA development.321",
        "Amino acid catabolism is vital during starvation to sustain glucose levels and provide alternative carbon sources, primarily in the liver but also in the kidneys, muscles and adipose tissue.322 This process involves transamination and oxidative deamination in the cytoplasm, producing metabolites such as α-ketoglutarate, pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, which feed into the TCA cycle.323 An essential NR in AA catabolism is ERRα, which is active in regulating genes involved in amino acid uptake and branched-chain amino acid metabolism.324 ERRα is also linked to reduced leucine oxidation under energy-demanding conditions.325 PPARα and HNF4α also regulate amino acid utilization. PPARα, in the presence of RXRα, inhibited HNF4α activity, suppressing serine dehydratase expression by promoting HNF4α degradation via the proteasome pathway. In PPARα-knockout mice, HNF4α levels and amino acid catabolizing enzyme (AACE) expression are elevated.326 In response to amino acid deficiency (AAD), MEF2D (myocyte enhancer factor 2D) and NR4A1 induce FAM134B2 expression and promote FAM134B2-mediated reticulophagy to maintain intracellular amino acid levels.327",
        "Compelling evidence suggests that NRs can regulate inflammation and immunity, contributing to the pathogenesis of human diseases. For example, Nur77 binds to LPS, acting as an LPS receptor protein and playing a role in macrophage pyroptosis. Further research indicated that Nur77-LPS interactions activated NLRP3, resulting in the formation of an atypical inflammasome. These findings demonstrated that Nur77 promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, enhancing the host immune response to endotoxins.174 Similarly, Nur77 was identified as a key transcriptional regulator of the proinflammatory metabolic switch in macrophages. IDH expression was not downregulated in Nur77-deficient macrophages, which led to increased levels of succinate and other TCA cycle metabolites, independent of glutamine, resulting in increased nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokine production in an SDH-dependent manner. Thus, Nur77 promotes an anti-inflammatory metabolic state in macrophages, offering protection against chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis.328 Another nuclear receptor, RORα, regulates hepatic macrophage polarization and inflammation by inducing kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) expression. In myeloid-specific RORα-deficient animals, Kupffer cells (KCs) and bone marrow-derived macrophages fail to undergo M2 polarization, rendering them more susceptible to high-fat-diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).329 Additionally, the orphan nuclear receptor TLX directly bound to the CD274 (PD-L1) gene promoter, showing a strong positive correlation with PD-L1 overexpression. Suppressing TLX significantly reduced the in vivo growth of glioma allografts and xenografts, preserved the antitumor immune response and markedly decreased the number of PD-L1-positive cells and glioma-associated macrophages.330 Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 (NR1D1) acts as a transcriptional repressor and plays a key role in regulating inflammation. The activation of NR1D1 decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), whereas NR1D1 silencing had the opposite effect. Additionally, NR1D1 activation reduces ROS production and increases the generation of Nrf2-associated antioxidant enzymes.331",
        "NRs also play crucial roles in modulating immune responses by directly regulating the function and activity of immune cells, such as influencing their development, differentiation and activation. For example, overexpression of NR4A1 inhibited the development of effector T cells through binding to the transcription factor AP-1 and inhibited its promotion of the expression of effector genes. NR4A1 binding encouraged the acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), which activated genes linked to tolerance. Deletion of NR4A1 increases immunity against tumors and chronic viruses, overcomes T-cell tolerance and enhances effector function.332 Similarly, another study revealed that NR4A triple knockout CAR-T lymphocytes presented traits and gene expression profiles typical of CD8+ effector T cells. The chromatin regions in these cells were enriched in binding motifs for transcription factors involved in T-cell activation, such as NF-κB and AP-1.333 These studies suggest that NR4A is a major regulator involved in the induction of T-cell dysfunction and that NR4A inhibition is a promising approach for cancer immunotherapy.",
        "RARs and RA signaling play crucial roles in immune responses, influencing immune tolerance, tissue homing, lymph node formation and protective immunity.334 RARs include RARα, RARβ and RARγ, which are encoded by different genes with unique transcriptional variants and isoforms. In the resting state, RARα binds to transcriptional repressors to inhibit gene expression. However, upon binding to RA, RARα tends to bind to transcriptional activators, promoting gene expression334 RAR signaling has been shown to regulate immunity. For example, following TCR stimulation, extranuclear RARα is rapidly phosphorylated and recruited to the TCR signalosome. RA disrupted extranuclear RARα signaling, leading to reduced TCR activation and increased conversion of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. RA is translocated to the nucleus by CRABP2, which is upregulated by TCR activation. Deletion of Crabp2 resulted in increased cytoplasmic RA, disrupting signalosome-associated RARα and consequently weakening autoimmune responses while diminishing antipathogen immunity.335",
        "The expression of nuclear receptors is not only related to tissue, sex, and disease but also varies across different age groups within the same individual.336 These variations reflect developmental needs, metabolic changes, hormonal shifts, and adaptations to aging-related physiological demands. Generally, developmental NRs such as RARs, PPARs and RXRs are highly expressed during embryogenesis and early development to support rapid growth, differentiation, and development.337 During adolescence, ARs, ERα and ERβ are elevated to correlate with puberty and the onset of secondary sexual characteristics, whereas GRs act to moderate stress responses and energy metabolism during periods of rapid physical and emotional development. PPARs, LXRs, and FXRs live in adult individuals to maintain lipid and glucose homeostasis, supporting metabolic stability during peak years of physical activity and reproductive capability. Diet, exercise, and stress significantly modulate NR expression, affecting metabolic and endocrine balance during this period. The expression of these NRs decreases with increasing age, which causes impaired lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity, cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, and calcium homeostasis and immune function, leading to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, compromised organ function and chronic inflammation. For example, Nr4a1 is reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CA1 pyramidal neurons with aging, which impairs cognition and excitatory synaptic function.338 Monitoring age-specific NR expression patterns could guide personalized therapies to optimize metabolic health and prevent age-related diseases.",
        "The metabolic cycling process of NRs, including their synthesis, activation, degradation, and recycling, is integral to maintaining homeostasis and ensuring that NRs can adapt to changing physiological demands. Since the activation and transcriptional regulation of nuclear receptors have been discussed above, we mainly emphasize their degradation and recycling. The degradation of nuclear receptors is a highly regulated process that involves proteasomal and lysosomal pathways, ensuring the dynamic control of receptor levels in response to physiological and environmental cues. Ligand binding can either stabilize or destabilize NRs by inducing conformational changes that influence ubiquitination.339,340 In addition, posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation,341 SUMOylation342 and acetylation,343 modify NR degradation rates by altering their interaction with ubiquitin ligases or stabilizing proteins. Moreover, many NRs, such as REV-ERBs and PPARs, exhibit circadian cycling, with their expression and activity oscillating in a 24-hour rhythm to align with metabolic needs.344,345 These rhythms are coregulated by core circadian clock genes (e.g., CLOCK and BMAL1), which synchronize metabolic functions with environmental cycles such as light and feeding. Altogether, cycling of NRs ensures appropriate receptor levels, preventing excessive or prolonged signaling that could lead to cellular dysfunction.",
        "With aging, the efficiency of key regulatory pathways declines, leading to altered NR turnover, disrupted signaling, and increased susceptibility to age-related diseases.346 Proteasomal dysfunction, a hallmark of aging, impairs the degradation of damaged or misfolded proteins, including NRs. This results in the accumulation of inactive or malfunctioning receptors, which disrupt signaling and contribute to metabolic and endocrine dysregulation, key features of aging. These disruptions play a central role in the development of diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and neurodegenerative disorders.347,348 Additionally, aging reduces autophagic flux, hindering the clearance of damaged proteins, including aggregated NRs. As autophagy becomes less efficient with age, NR aggregates persist, disrupting receptor signaling and promoting chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular stress.349,350 These factors are implicated in the progression of age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and frailty. Oxidative stress also contributes to aging-related cellular damage by directly modifying NRs. ROS cause conformational changes in NRs, preventing their proper ubiquitination and degradation. This oxidation makes NRs resistant to degradation, leading to the accumulation of damaged receptors and further dysfunction in signaling pathways.351 Understanding these age-related changes offers valuable insights for developing targeted therapies to restore NR homeostasis and mitigate aging-associated disorders.",
        "Given the critical role of NRs in physiological and pathological processes, they constitute a highly significant and privileged class of intracellular druggable targets for treating various diseases.52,352–354 By modulating these receptors, it is possible to influence a wide range of conditions, from metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity to immune-related diseases such as autoimmune disorders and inflammatory conditions (Tables 1, 2). NRs are central to cancer progression and hormone regulation, making them prime targets for oncology and hormone therapies. The ability to design drugs that specifically interact with nuclear receptors enhances their potential for precision medicine, offering more targeted treatments with fewer side effects across a broad spectrum of diseases.Table 1Summary of completed clinical trials of nuclear receptor-targeted drugsTargetNCT NumberResultsConditionsAgentsPhasesRetinoic acid receptor-α (RARα)NCT02273102COMPLETED (No Results Posted)Acute Myelogenous Leukemia; Myelodysplastic Syndromes; LeukemiaTranylcypromine; TretinoinPHASE1Retinoic acid receptor-γ (RARγ)NCT02521792TERMINATED (The study was stopped prematurely and due to the small number of evaluable subjects, there was insufficient data to conduct any efficacy analyses.

        "NRs, especially those that bind to three steroid hormones, namely, estrogen, progesterone and androgen, play a significant role in the development of human malignancies, particularly breast cancer,355,356 ovarian cancer357 and prostate cancer.358 In recent years, NR-targeted drugs have attracted widespread attention as novel therapeutic strategies359–361 that play a significant role in inhibiting the growth and progression of many types of cancer.",
        "Within the nuclear receptor superfamily, ERs were the first nuclear receptors to be described. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with ER+ breast cancer accounting for approximately 75% of all cases. Numerous studies have confirmed that ERα plays a causative role in carcinogenesis. As a result, an increasing number of ERα-based targeted medicines have entered preclinical and clinical trials (Table 1), and some have even received FDA approval. This includes directly antagonizing the estrogen receptor via SERMs and selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). These drugs include ER antagonists, selective ER modulators and aromatase inhibitors.362 ER antagonists competitively inhibit the ER, whereas selective ER modulators function as partial agonists or antagonists on the basis of their tissue affinity. Aromatase inhibitors decrease estrogen production by blocking aromatase in tissues such as the ovaries and adipose tissue.363,364 Tamoxifen is the most widely used antiestrogen for hormone-dependent breast cancer and is indicated for various treatment settings. Evidence shows that patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors are more likely to benefit from tamoxifen. FDA-approved treatments include treating breast cancer in both females and males, providing adjuvant therapy after surgery and radiation, treating female patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) postsurgery and radiation to lower the risk of invasive breast cancer and reduce the risk of breast cancer in certain high-risk patients.365,366 In addition to tamoxifen, many other SERMs, including raloxifene, lasofoxifene, bazedoxifene and fulvestrant, have been developed and used for breast cancer treatment.363 These drugs have also been used to treat other tumors with high estrogen expression. In addition to hormone-dependent breast cancer, antiestrogen medications such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors have shown efficacy in managing conditions such as endometrial cancer and certain types of ovarian cancer.367,368 Although estrogen levels are low in prostate tissue, ER expression has been detected in some prostate cancer patients.369 ER activation is believed to be associated with the proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer cells.370 Thus, antiestrogen therapy targeting the ER has also been proposed as a new treatment strategy for prostate cancer. For example, in males with advanced prostate cancer, an ERα agonist, GTx-758, has been shown to lower testosterone with fewer side effects associated with androgen-deprivation therapy.371",
        "Bidedoxifene is the most recent generation of SERMs. Fanning and colleagues demonstrated that bazedoxifene works in concert with palbociclib, a CDK4/6b inhibitor, and is more effective than tamoxifen against specific ERα mutants, such as Y537S and D538G. A phase II clinical trial in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ [NCT02694809] and a phase I/II clinical trial on bazedoxifene in combination with palbociclib in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer [NCT02448771] are two examples of the numerous clinical trials that have examined bazedoxifene across a variety of cancer types. Degradation of this receptor by SERDs is another tactic to target ERs. Fulvestrant is the most researched SERD, and its clinical application has been growing. Clinical trials have combined fulvestrant with CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib in men and postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer [NCT02422615] and palbociclib in hormone receptor+HER2-metastasized breast cancer after endocrine failure [NCT01942135], as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinasitol kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors, such as pictilisib, in advanced or metastatic breast cancer in participants resistant to aromatase inhibitor therapy [NCT01437566].",
        "The abnormal expression of AR in prostate cancer cells makes anti-AR drugs a logical treatment strategy.372 These drugs inhibit AR function through various mechanisms, reducing androgen stimulation of tumor cells. Among the most common anti-AR agents are AR antagonists such as abiraterone and enzalutamide. These drugs competitively bind to the AR, preventing androgen attachment and inhibiting receptor activity. Abiraterone has been shown to prolong survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).373 In the context of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), a combination treatment involving abiraterone, prednisone and docetaxel has favorable effects.374 Furthermore, for metastasis-free survival, combining enzalutamide with leuprolide has shown superior outcomes compared with leuprolide alone in high-risk patients with biochemical recurrence. Additionally, enzalutamide monotherapy has outperformed leuprolide monotherapy.36 The prostate cancer community has recently focused much attention on a number of newly created AR proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which were created as SARDs. ARV-110 [NCT03888612], the first AR PROTAC to reach clinical trials, is now being used in patients with metastatic CRPC and is undergoing a phase I/II clinical trial. In contrast to clinically licensed AR antagonists, ARD-61, a novel AR PROTAC, has been shown to efficiently promote on-target AR degradation, elicit more potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects, and reduce downstream AR target gene expression in prostate cancer cells. The most effective AR PROTACs may eventually be utilized extensively in cancer patients, and we expect more advancements to the clinical trial stage.",
        "Additionally, RARs and their heterodimer partners, such as PPARs and RXR, which are involved in vitamin A metabolism, cell differentiation and immune regulation, also have therapeutic potential.375,376 Aberrant RXR signaling can promote cancer development by disrupting normal cellular homeostasis and enhancing oncogenic processes. RXR agonists have shown potential in treating various advanced cancers in clinical trials. IRX4204, in combination with erlotinib, is under investigation for previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [NCT02991651]. NRX194204 is being studied for its efficacy in castration- and taxane-resistant prostate cancer [NCT01540071] and advanced NSCLC [NCT00964132]. Additionally, bexarotene is being evaluated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients with stage III or IV disease [NCT00003752, NCT00514293, NCT01134341, NCT00316030]. These studies underscore the therapeutic potential of RXR agonists in managing resistant and advanced malignancies. PPAR agonists have shown promising antitumor effects across a range of cancers, either as standalone treatments or in combination therapies. Troglitazone has shown efficacy in prostate cancer and liposarcoma [NCT00003058], whereas pioglitazone is being studied for advanced solid tumors [NCT02133625], pancreatic cancer [NCT01838317], and thyroid cancer [NCT01655719], often with chemotherapy. Inolitazone combined with paclitaxel is under investigation for advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer [NCT02152137]. Rosiglitazone is being explored for the treatment of liposarcoma [NCT00004180], metastatic thyroid cancer [NCT00098852], and androgen-dependent prostate cancer [NCT00182052]. These trials demonstrate the therapeutic potential of PPAR agonists in treating challenging malignancies. Retinoic acid, a natural RAR agonist, regulates the expression of genes related to cell growth. Studies suggest that RAR/RXR agonists may have antitumor effects on prostate cancer. For example, the RAR agonist adapalene has been shown to induce a tumor-suppressive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in prostate cancer cells. In combination with docetaxel, adapalene enhanced tumor suppression and improved natural killer (NK) cell-mediated clearance in preclinical models. This approach also increased the efficacy of NK cell infusion in mice with human prostate cancer, leading to greater tumor suppression.377",
        "REV-ERBs, including REV-ERBα (NR1D1) and REV-ERBβ (NR1D2), are key regulators of the circadian clock. Notably, many tumor types exhibit elevated expression of REV-ERBβ, regardless of ERBB2 or ER status, whereas nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells primarily express REV-ERBα. High levels of REV-ERBβ in cancer cells have been linked to reduced sensitivity to chloroquine via the modulation of autophagy, suggesting a role in therapy resistance. REV-ERB agonists, such as SR9009 and SR9011, selectively target cancer cells and oncogene-induced senescent cells, such as melanocytic naevi, without impacting normal cell viability. These agonists have shown promising anticancer effects, including reduced glioblastoma growth and improved survival in mice, without causing significant toxicity.378",
        "Metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), obesity, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis represent a growing global health burden.379,380 These conditions are frequently associated with dysregulated lipid or glucose metabolism.381,382 NRs play crucial roles in maintaining metabolic homeostasis by controlling the expression of genes involved in lipid, glucose and energy metabolism. Among NRs, PPARs, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), liver X receptor (LXR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) have been identified as promising therapeutic targets. Drugs that modulate these receptors, such as PPAR agonists and FXR agonists, have demonstrated promising activity in clinical trials for the treatment of metabolic disorders, particularly NAFLD. Here, we explore current and emerging therapies that target these receptors.",
        "One of the most well-known nuclear receptors is the PPAR family. PPAR agonists, such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, can increase insulin sensitivity in individuals with T2D. By activating PPARγ, these drugs enhance glucose uptake and lipid storage, which helps to lower blood sugar levels and improve metabolic control. However, these drugs are associated with certain risks, such as weight gain and fluid retention, necessitating careful patient management. PPARα agonists, such as fibrates, have been used clinically for 35 years to regulate blood lipids and prevent atherosclerosis.383 Pemafibrate was introduced in Japan in June 2018 and has since been demonstrated to be effective in inhibiting VLDL secretion and enhancing triglyceride (TG) clearance by activating LPL.384 In mice fed a high-fat diet, it suppressed postprandial hyperlipidemia by downregulating the mRNA expression of the intestinal cholesterol transporter NPC1L1 and upregulating genes involved in β-oxidation to inhibit VLDL secretion from the liver. In a 4-week trial with dyslipidemic patients (0.4 mg/day), pemafibrate significantly reduced fasting and nonfasting serum TG, RemL-C, and apo B-48 levels, with a marked reduction in the postprandial TG AUC, indicating improved postprandial hypertriglyceridemia.385 Similar results were observed in diabetic patients treated with pemafibrate.386 PPARγ and PPARδ regulate energy utilization and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. High insulin levels accelerate the development of NAFLD through a PPARγ-dependent pathway.387 PPARγ agonists, thiazolidinediones, have been used as insulin sensitizers in diabetic patients.388 PPARδ agonists improved the pathological manifestations of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) without affecting body weight. The dual PPARα/δ agonist elafibranor (GFT505) improved glycemic and lipid metabolism in NASH patients in a phase II clinical trial, reduced liver inflammation and did not exacerbate fibrosis, demonstrating good tolerability. Phase III clinical trials targeting NASH patients [NCT02704403] are ongoing. A phase II clinical trial of the dual PPARα/γ agonist Saroglitazar [NCT03061721] in NASH patients was completed in April 2020. Midterm reports revealed not only regression of NASH tissue lesions but also decreased serum ALT levels, indicating improved liver function. The Indian pharmaceutical company Zydus Cadila has submitted a marketing application for this drug.",
        "Another good NR drug target is FXR, which regulates bile acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis. FXR activation improves lipid metabolism and reduces liver inflammation, offering a new avenue for managing metabolic liver disorders.389–391 Obeticholic acid, an FXR agonist also known as INT-747, is approved for treating NAFLD and NASH392 [NCT02548351]. Owing to its ability to lower ALP levels and combat cholestasis and fibrosis, obeticholic acid (Ocaliva) was initially approved as a treatment for primary biliary cholangitis. In a phase III clinical trial for NASH [NCT02548351], obeticholic acid improved liver function and reduced tissue pathology, although it exhibited some side effects, such as pruritus and increased low-density lipoprotein levels. Given that pruritus can be managed symptomatically and that dyslipidemia can be addressed by the concomitant use of statins, the United States Food and Drug Administration has approved obeticholic acid as the primary treatment for NASH. Several other FXR agonists with diverse physicochemical characteristics, including bile acid derivatives, nonbile acid-derived steroidal FXR agonists, nonsteroidal FXR agonists and partial FXR agonists, are also progressing through advanced stages of clinical development. The noncarboxylic acid steroidal FXR agonist EDP-305 has been shown to modulate many pathways that trigger antilipogenic, anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic gene signatures. This resulted in hepatoprotective and antisteatotic effects in a mouse model of NASH.393 Patients with intestinal failure require more complicated care when they have parenteral nutrition (PN)-associated cholestasis (PNAC). By restoring hepatic FXR signaling, GW4064 protected animals against PNAC by increasing the expression of sterol and phospholipid transporters and canalicular bile and suppressing the recruitment and activation of macrophages. These findings suggest that increasing FXR activity could be used as a therapeutic approach to treat or prevent PNAC.394",
        "In addition to PPAR and FXR, LXR is involved in cholesterol metabolism and can be targeted for atherosclerosis treatment. LXR agonists have been shown to increase cholesterol efflux and reduce the development of atherosclerotic plaques in preclinical models.395 However, treating patients with medications that increase cholesterol is not a practical option for metabolic illnesses; instead, methods for separating the advantageous effects of LXR ligands from unfavorable side effects must be investigated. Taken together, these examples highlight the growing potential of NR-targeted drugs in addressing the underlying causes of metabolic disorders, offering more precise and effective treatments than traditional approaches do.",
        "The targeting of NRs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases has gained significant attention because of the pivotal role these receptors play in regulating the expression of genes involved in metabolic, inflammatory and lipid processes.361,396–398 Nuclear receptors, such as PPARs, LXR and FXR, are key regulators of lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis and inflammation, all of which are critical factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. By modulating these receptors, it is possible to control pathological processes such as atherosclerosis, hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders.",
        "The NRs RORα and REV-ERBα are key components of the circadian system and regulate biological rhythms, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, vascular inflammation and fibrinolysis.399 RORα is instrumental in endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) differentiation and promotes angiogenesis, tissue repair and vascular stability by inducing erythropoietin production and activating AMPK.400 RORα mediates the protective effects of melatonin, including its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects, making it a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction.401,402 In hypertensive rats, melatonin altered clock gene expression patterns, maintaining high levels of REV-ERBα mRNA, which regulated blood pressure rhythms. This effect is linked to melatonin receptor activity and may involve posttranslational mechanisms.403 Increased RORα expression, which is stimulated by melatonin and the sympathetic nervous system, also protects against programmed hypertension. A number of small-molecule agonists for RORα and REV-ERBα, such as the pharmacological agents SR9009 and GSK4112 for REV-ERBα, have been developed404 and are available for use in cellular and animal experiments, but prospective studies on the impact of stable circadian rhythms on CHD and heart failure are still limited.405,406 When considered collectively, the bulk of current research points to considerable clinical value and therapeutic potential for medications that target RORα and REV-ERBα to treat hypertension and atherosclerosis.",
        "Several studies have highlighted the function of RXRs in cardiovascular disease. Treatment with 9cRA or the synthetic RXR agonist LGD1069 (bexarotene) has been shown to reduce oxidative stress-induced cell damage and preserve the mitochondrial membrane potential.407 In heart failure, oxidative stress activates angiotensin-II (AngII), leading to harmful cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Bexarotene treatment of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells inhibited AngII-driven inflammation and p38 MAPK activation, suggesting that RXR activation has protective effects on cardiac disease.408 ERRα and ERRγ are essential for normal postnatal cardiovascular function, whereas ERRβ supports maximal ATP generation in contracting cardiomyocytes. ERR agonists help maintain oxidative metabolism, which protects the heart against pressure overload-induced heart failure (HF) in vivo. Using a structure-based design, Xu and colleagues synthesized two pan-ERR agonists, SLU-PP-332 and SLU-PP-915, each of which significantly improved the ejection fraction, reduced fibrosis and enhanced survival in models of pressure overload-induced HF without affecting cardiac hypertrophy.409 Targeting other nuclear receptors, such as RARs, PPARs, and LXRs, has also shown promise for ameliorating cardiovascular disease.410,411 These findings provide strong pharmacological evidence supporting the potential of targeting NRs for cardiovascular disease management.",
        "Alzheimer’s disease (AD), PD, Huntington’s disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebral ischemia, stroke and other conditions are common central nervous system disorders that currently affect approximately one hundred million people worldwide. Compelling evidence suggests that nuclear receptors are important in these disorders and that targeting these receptors has significant therapeutic potential.353",
        "Liver X receptor LXRs are key regulators of cholesterol trafficking in the central nervous system (CNS), working with ApoE to facilitate cholesterol recycling and efflux, which are essential for maintaining CNS homeostasis. Dysregulation of LXR signaling is linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, PD and Niemann‒Pick type C disease. LXR activation offers therapeutic potential by modulating neuroinflammation in CNS disorders. In AD models, LXR agonists such as T0901317 reduce inflammation associated with amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and tau tangles by suppressing microglial activation and the expression of inflammatory markers such as iNOS, COX-2, and NF-κB. Similar effects are observed in PD models, where T0901317 decreases iNOS and COX-2 levels. In Niemann–Pick type C disease, LXR activation promotes cholesterol clearance, reduces cerebellar inflammation, and extends lifespan. LXRs also enhance blood‒brain barrier (BBB) integrity by increasing the expression of ABC transporters such as ABCB1, which prevents toxin entry into the brain. Natural LXR agonists (e.g., oxysterols) and RXR activation (e.g., with bexarotene) improve BBB function in coculture models, whereas LXR agonists support tissue regeneration in ischemic stroke by stabilizing the BBB and reducing inflammatory cytokines. Although preclinical results are promising, the clinical translation of LXR agonists is hindered by side effects, including elevated triglycerides and LDL cholesterol.284 Efforts to mitigate these issues include the development of selective LXRβ agonists, regional drug delivery, and the targeting of specific downstream pathways, making LXRs promising therapeutic targets for CNS diseases.",
        "PPARs, particularly PPARγ, play pivotal roles in neuroprotection by regulating neuroinflammation, mitochondrial function, and antioxidant defenses. It is expressed in various CNS cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. Dysregulation of PPARs is associated with neurodegenerative diseases characterized by inflammation, such as AD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). PPARγ agonists, including endogenous ligands such as OA and synthetic compounds such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have shown promise in preclinical models because they reduce inflammatory cytokines, increase IL-10 levels, and enhance mitochondrial function in conditions such as stroke, ischemia, and traumatic brain injury. Moreover, PPARγ activation has exhibited potential benefits in neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, and mood disorders) and neurodegenerative diseases, with ongoing clinical trials exploring its applications in AD, PD, MS, and bipolar disorder412 [NCT00982202, NCT00736996, NCT00265148, NCT00733785, NCT00688207, NCT01280123]. However, mixed clinical outcomes highlight gaps in understanding the mechanisms of PPARγ within the CNS.413 Further research aimed at optimizing PPARγ activity may unlock its full therapeutic potential for treating neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions.",
        "The GR also plays a critical role in neuroinflammation, neuroprotection, and brain homeostasis. Its anti-inflammatory effects in the brain are mediated through interactions with AP-1 and NF-κB, limiting their transcriptional activity.414 GR also regulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), promotes neurogenesis, neuronal survival, and synaptic plasticity, and contributes to memory, aging, and behavior. Additionally, GR supports BBB integrity by upregulating tight junction proteins and establishing metabolic barriers to xenobiotics.415,416 GR dysfunction has been implicated in various neuropathologies, including AD, HD and epilepsy. Abnormal GR expression in AD is correlated with hippocampal overexpression, impaired cortisol feedback, and memory deficits.417 Similarly, GR overexpression in epilepsy has been associated with reactive gliosis and coregulation with PXR in epileptic brain endothelial cells. GR dysregulation also affects HD-related changes, such as increased cortisol secretion and muscular atrophy, alongside reduced GR expression in the hypothalamic and pituitary regions. GR abnormalities also underlie mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, as dysfunction in GR and MR signaling leads to maladaptive stress responses, dendritic retraction, and impaired serotonin activity.418,419 GR dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus has been linked to anxiety and depression-like behaviors in animal models. Pharmacological modulation of the GR provides therapeutic opportunities. GR agonists, such as dexamethasone and methylprednisolone, are widely used to treat neurological conditions such as gliomas, MS, and traumatic brain injuries. Dexamethasone reduces edema, prevents cerebrovascular leakage, and upregulates tight junction proteins at the BBB.420,421 Methylprednisolone improves memory and long-term potentiation at low doses but has dose-dependent effects, with high doses alleviating motor deficits in MS models but not cognition.422,423 GR antagonists, such as mifepristone and relacorilant, have shown efficacy in treating mood disorders, neurodegenerative conditions, and PTSD. Mifepristone restores serotonin signaling and alleviates depression-like behaviors, whereas relacorilant is undergoing phase II and III trials for conditions such as Cushing syndrome and prostate cancer424,425 [NCT036748142019, NCT036971092019]. These findings underscore the potential of targeting GRs in a range of CNS disorders.",
        "Estrogens and their receptors play critical roles in neuroprotection and the regulation of inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes in the CNS. Owing to their antiapoptotic, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties, estrogens provide early protection against ischemic injury. ERα and ERβ agonists, such as diarylpropionitrile (DPN), have demonstrated neuroprotective effects by mitigating damage in ischemic models, including the caudate nucleus and CA1 region of ovariectomized mice and the striatum of male mice. The membrane receptor GPER-1 also contributes to ischemic protection, with its agonist G1 offering estrogen-like neuroprotection, particularly in males, as suggested by sex-dependent differences in GPER-1 expression. In addition to estrogens, NRs such as Nr4a2 and bile acid receptors play vital roles in alleviating neuroinflammation and neuropathic pain. Nr4a2 helps regulate depressive-like behaviors by preventing structural and functional damage to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) microglia and excitatory neurons during chronic neuroinflammation.426 Its upregulation through the dopaminergic agonist pramipexole has demonstrated neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson’s disease.427 Similarly, bile acids activate TGR5 and FXR, alleviating mechanical hyperalgesia by reducing glial activation and neuronal sensitization in the spinal dorsal horn. The presence of bile acid synthesis enzymes in spinal astrocytes suggests an endogenous mechanism for decreasing nociceptive neuron transmission and mechanical hypersensitivity, emphasizing bile acid receptors as promising targets for neuropathic pain relief.428 In MS, Th17-driven inflammation is aggravated by RORγt overexpression, which promotes Th17 cell differentiation. By suppressing RORγt, vitamin A has shown therapeutic potential for MS429[NCT01225289]. Collectively, these findings highlight the diverse and pivotal roles of estrogens and nuclear receptors in neuroprotection, inflammation regulation, and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.",
        "In recent decades, global spending on infectious diseases has increased significantly, with treatment costs rising faster than those for other diseases. Infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites include common conditions such as pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, malaria, and dengue fever, as well as diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. NRs play a key role in regulating immune responses by modulating genes involved in inflammation, pathogen defense, and immune cell function, thus influencing the outcome of both bacterial and viral infections. Given the increasingly appreciated roles of NRs in the context of infections, targeting NRs may provide a new, largely unexplored area for infectious disease treatment.430",
        "The role of FXR extends to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, where it, along with other NRs, such as HNF4α, PPARα, and PXR, reprograms hepatocyte metabolism, influencing glycolysis, ketogenesis, and drug metabolism.431 The targeting of FXR or PPARα in HCV infection has shown complex antiviral effects, with receptor inhibition reducing viral replication by reversing HCV-induced metabolic shifts. Furthermore, FXR agonists such as GW4064 have demonstrated potential in alleviating inflammation and preserving intestinal barrier function in experimental colitis, primarily through the modulation of NF-κB signaling.432,433 In addition, GW4064 has been reported to downregulate scavenger receptors via FXR and indirectly inhibits HCV entry into cells.434",
        "In addition to their roles in viral infections, NRs are essential in bacterial infection. For example, PPARγ signaling is crucial for resolving Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections and improving outcomes in sepsis models by modulating inflammation.435 PPARγ agonists such as pioglitazone have been shown to restore mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative stress in macrophages, highlighting their potential in treating inflammatory and infectious diseases.436 LXRs are involved in macrophage phagocytic responses, particularly during Salmonella Typhimurium infections.437 In a mouse model, LXR agonist treatment ameliorated clinical signs of Salmonella infection in a CD38-dependent manner.438 Recent transcriptomic studies investigating susceptibility to dengue virus in a Cuban cohort of African ancestry revealed increased gene expression of RXR in individuals who were more resistant to infection and suggested a protective role for LXR/RXR against dengue virus.439 In the case of tuberculosis (TB), NRs such as Nur77 and Nor1 are upregulated in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Interestingly, the first-line TB drug rifampicin activates PXR, which can impair its effectiveness in infected macrophages, underscoring the complex interactions between NRs and drug efficacy.440,441 Rifampicin, a first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug, is a potent activator of PXRs, which in turn compromises the effect of rifampicin in M. tuberculosis-infected human macrophages.442",
        "NRs also influence fungal infections, with PPARγ playing a central role in defending against Candida albicans in the gastrointestinal tract. PPARγ ligands reduce fungal colonization through a dectin-1-dependent mechanism. Sepsis models have revealed a critical role for PPARγ in controlling inflammation and improving overall disease outcomes. PPARγ gene expression was downregulated in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from human sepsis patients as well as in the lungs in a murine sepsis model.443 Treatment with PPARγ agonists improved sepsis outcomes, decreased proinflammatory cytokine levels, increased IL-10 levels, and improved mouse survival.444 Other PPAR isoforms have also been linked to decreased severity of sepsis through the downregulation of inflammation. In a cecal ligation and puncture rat sepsis model, treatment with a PPARβ/δ agonist inhibited signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation in AMs, reduced the inflammatory response, and prolonged rat survival.445,446",
        "Parasitic worms are among the global health threats to billions of humans worldwide.447,448 Although several anthelmintic drugs, including benzimidazole, levamisole/morantel and ivermectin, have been used to treat these parasites, resistance frequently occurs. Therefore, identifying novel therapeutic targets in parasitic diseases is urgently needed. Nuclear receptors, which are well-known therapeutic targets in humans, are currently being investigated in parasitic worms because of their widespread distribution and important functions in controlling transcriptional networks involved in metabolism and development.449 Among them, DAF-12 is a nuclear receptor that is necessary for the typical development of nematodes, including the crucial infectious stage. In free-living nematodes such as C. elegans, a lack of DAF-12 ligands (such as dafachronic acid (DA)) under stress conditions promotes entry into the L3d (dauer diapause) state, whereas supplementation with DAF-12 ligands in prosperous environments leads to their exit from L3d and the beginning of reproductive development.450 In contrast, in parasitic nematodes such as S. stercoralis, the absence of a DAF-12 ligand leads to an L3d ortholog stage, termed the infectious L3 (iL3) stage, during preinfection, whereas the presence of a DAF-12 ligand in the definitive host can resume reproductive development.451",
        "The mechanism underlying DAF-12-mediated cell fate decisions is similar to that of other nuclear receptors. Briefly, under favorable conditions or in a host-specific environment, DAF-12 binds with its ligand and is thus activated, which induces the transcription of target genes that facilitate metabolism and development. In contrast, under stress conditions, DAF-12 is inactive without ligand binding, resulting in transcriptional repression and subsequent development arrest and infection. Thus, strategies targeting DAF-12 or its ligands have potential for the treatment of parasitic diseases. In addition to exogenous DA, endogenous Δ7-DA was recently reported as a novel ligand of DAF-12 in S. stercoralis. The abundance of Δ7-DA is regulated by several enzymes, including DAF-36, DHS-16, and DAF-9, which govern the on/off switch of the reproduction, infection and development processes in this parasitic nematode.452 In addition to receptors and ligands, other components, such as cofactors, can also be potential targets for the manipulation of the life cycle of parasitic nematodes. For example, DAF-12 interacting protein-1 (DIP-1) was recently identified as a coactivator of DAF-12, which is indispensable for the ligand-activated transcriptional activity of DAF-12 in Strongyloides spp.453 Together, this evidence suggests that the nuclear receptor DAF-12 is a promising target for the treatment of parasitic diseases.",
        "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a type of reproductive disease that affects 5–18% of women worldwide who are of reproductive age.454 Interestingly, patients with PCOS are frequently associated with metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance or increased fasting insulin,455 which is closely linked to an abnormal gut microbiome. A recent study revealed that PCOS can be induced by alterations in the gut microbiome via the activation of the nuclear receptor FXR.456 Mechanistically, agmatine produced by B. vulgatus can activate FXR, which in turn prevents L cells from secreting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), suggesting that FXR is a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of PCOS.456 Moreover, PPAR is a large nuclear receptor superfamily related to energy metabolism and is thus involved in the progression of PCOS. In fact, all three PPAR family members, including PPARα, PPARβ/δ and PPARγ, play critical roles in PCOS via multiple mechanisms, such as the regulation of lipogenesis; glucose homeostasis; and fatty acid oxidation, synthesis and storage.457 Given the important function of PPARs in PCOS pathogenesis, modulating the activity of PPARs profoundly affects the development of PCOS. For example, the activation of PPARγ by a polyphenolic compound, sinapic acid, was shown to ameliorate metabolic dysfunction and attenuate PCOS phenotypes in rats.458 Another study focusing on the downstream mechanism underlying PPAR-mediated alleviation of PCOS indicated that PPARα can bind to the promoter of FADS2, a ferroptosis-related gene, thus increasing FADS2 transcription. This event inhibits ferroptosis of granulosa cells in a dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS mouse model, suggesting that PPARα alleviates PCOS by protecting granulosa cells from ferroptosis.459",
        "Uterine leiomyomas, another name for uterine fibroids, are benign tumors of the fibrotic smooth muscle in the reproductive system. The ovarian steroid hormone estrogen, as well as its receptor ER, are involved in this disease.460 In addition, other nuclear receptors, such as the NR4A protein family, may also participate in the progression of uterine fibroids.461 NR4A restricts the proliferation of primary leiomyoma smooth muscle cells by modeling the extracellular matrix, whereas low expression of NR4A contributes to the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids. Moreover, leuprolide acetate, a GnRH analog used to treat uterine fibroids, can restore the expression of NR4A1 and NR4A3 in clinical samples, suggesting that these two NR4A family members might be additional targets of leuprolide acetate in addition to sex steroid receptors.",
        "While NRs are intimately involved in proper kidney function, they are also implicated in a variety of renal diseases, such as diabetes, acute kidney injury, and other conditions, such as aging. In the last 10 years, our understanding of renal disease etiology and progression has been greatly shaped by knowledge regarding how NRs are dysregulated in these conditions. Importantly, NRs have also become attractive therapeutic targets for the attenuation of renal diseases, and their modulation for this purpose has been the subject of intense investigation. Here, we review the roles of six key renal NRs, including PPAR, ERR, FXR, ER, LXR, and VDR, in health and disease, with an emphasis on recent findings over the last decade.",
        "PPARs are involved in various renal diseases, both acute and chronic. PPARα-null mice treated with streptozotocin (STZ) exhibit accelerated diabetic nephropathy, including worsened albuminuria, glomerular sclerosis, mesangial matrix expansion, collagen deposition, and macrophage infiltration. PPARα agonists have been studied as potential treatments for diabetic nephropathy (DN) in rodents, with evidence supporting their renoprotective effects. Recent research by Chung et al.demonstrated that impairment of PPARα and fatty acid oxidation exacerbates kidney fibrosis during aging, with reduced PPARα expression and lipid accumulation in tubular cells.462 PPARα-null mice also exhibit more severe renal aging and fibrosis. Jao et al.reported that ATF6 downregulates PPARα transcription, leading to decreased fatty acid oxidation and increased lipotoxicity in proximal tubule cells, whereas ATF6-deficient mice exhibit increased PPARα expression and decreased lipid accumulation.463 In addition to PPARα, PPARγ has also been studied in DN, with evidence suggesting that its activity is suppressed in this disease. Unlike other PPAR family members, PPARβ/δ is ubiquitously expressed in both cortical and medullary cells. Recent studies have highlighted a potential role for PPARβ/δ in renal homeostasis. For example, Kirkby et al. demonstrated that activation of renal PPARβ/δ by endogenous prostacyclin induces vasodilation and improves blood flow, a process regulated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).464 This COX-2/prostacyclin/PPARβ/δ axis offers new insights into kidney vascular physiology and therapeutic possibilities. Additionally, activation of PPARβ/δ has been shown to improve renal dysfunction in a lupus mouse model by lowering blood pressure, reducing renal hypertrophy, decreasing albuminuria, and preventing renal injury.465",
        "Additionally, other nuclear receptors play key roles in kidney health. ERRs are crucial regulators in the kidneys, where they help maintain metabolic balance, regulate monovalent cation homeostasis, and control blood pressure.466 The importance of ERRs is further highlighted by the fact that the deletion of ERRγ leads to significant mitochondrial dysfunction and progressive renal failure.467 For example, ERRα has been shown to protect against AKI in tubular epithelial cells, particularly in cases of cisplatin-induced AKI in mice.468 Compared with those in wild-type mice, in ERRα-null mice subjected to cisplatin treatment, tubular injury, a reduced mitochondrial content, abnormal mitochondrial morphology, and increased oxidative stress were observed. A recent study demonstrated that Nr4a1 was upregulated in the kidneys of mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), and its expression was positively correlated with the degree of interstitial kidney injury and the level of fibrotic proteins. Nr4a1 may contribute to renal fibrosis by activating the p38 MAPK pathway, as treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 successfully inhibited fibrotic protein expression and p38 MAPK phosphorylation.184 Furthermore, VDR has been shown to exert a renoprotective effect by inhibiting fibrosis. VDR translocates into the nucleus to form the VDR:RXR heterodimer, which inhibits fibrogenic gene expression in HK-2 cells exposed to high glucose and reduces fibrogenic gene expression in proximal renal tubules.469 In the aging kidney, the expression of FXR and TGR5 is decreased. However, a dual agonist of FXR and TGR5, INT-767, has been found to reverse age-related kidney disease in mice, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of targeting these receptors in renal aging.470 In conclusion, nuclear receptors play vital roles in regulating kidney function and protecting against kidney injury and fibrosis. Understanding their mechanisms and interactions could open new avenues for therapeutic strategies to treat kidney diseases, particularly those related to aging and fibrosis.",
        "Several challenges remain in targeting NRs therapeutically due to the complexity of NR signaling, tissue specificity, and the need for precise drug design. However, recent advancements in genomics, proteomics, imaging, and computational modeling have enabled more precise exploration of NR function, regulation, and their involvement in various physiological and pathological processes.",
        "Technologies such as ChIP-chip, ChIP-Seq, and GRO-Seq have enabled unbiased, genome-wide profiling of NR binding sites, revealing new insights into NR mechanisms and their regulatory networks in breast cancer. These genomic methods have highlighted the dynamic interactions between NRs and the chromatin landscape. It is increasingly clear that chromatin, in its varying states of condensation, both regulates and is regulated by NR activity, with NR-chromatin interactions playing a major role in cell type-specific transcriptional regulation.471 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has further advanced our understanding of NR function by enabling gene expression analysis at the single-cell level. This technology is invaluable for investigating tissue-specific NR roles and identifying distinct signaling pathways in various cell populations, which is crucial for understanding their contributions to tissue homeostasis, development, and diseases like cancer and metabolic disorders.472 For instance, single-cell transcriptomics revealed the involvement of a previously uncharacterized retinoic acid receptor family member, SmRAR, in reproductive development in Schistosoma mansoni.473 CRISPR-Cas9 technology has revolutionized NR research by allowing precise manipulation of genes in vitro and in vivo. This has facilitated studies of NR roles in diseases such as type 2 diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer, and provide reversible and tunable control of NR expression, enabling dynamic investigation of NR function.474,475",
        "Recent advances in proteomics, particularly mass spectrometry (MS), have enabled the identification and quantification of NR interactomes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating NR activity. MS also helps identify post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, acetylation, and SUMOylation, which are crucial for NR activation and signaling.306 Cryo-EM has emerged as a powerful tool for visualizing the 3D structure of proteins, including NRs, at near-atomic resolution. This technique has provided key insights into the conformational changes NRs undergo upon ligand binding and co-factor recruitment, essential for drug discovery, as many NRs are targeted by small molecules in diseases like cancer, diabetes, and inflammation.476 For example, cryo-EM has elucidated the assembly of the AR:coactivator complex and its role in coactivator assembly and transcriptional regulation.70 Additionally, the cryo-EM structure of the NCOA4-FTH1 interface revealed key amino acids crucial for interaction, paving the way for developing ferritinophagy modulators.477 These technologies, including cryo-EM and omics, have advanced our understanding of NR activation, NR-chromatin interactions, transcriptional regulation, and non-genomic effects, offering new avenues for therapeutic development.",
        "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly applied in NR research to predict receptor-ligand interactions, identify novel signaling pathways, and design drugs targeting specific NR subtypes. These technologies analyze large datasets to uncover hidden patterns within complex biological systems, enhancing our understanding of NRs in health and disease. For example, chemical language models combined with beam search algorithms have been used for automated molecule design, leading to the development of novel inverse agonists for retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs) with low micromolar to nanomolar potency.478 AI and deep docking methodologies have also facilitated the development of VPC-260724, a novel ER-AF2 binder that inhibits ER activity and exhibits antiproliferative effects in ER-positive breast cancer models.479 Additionally, AI has been applied to create an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network for chemical-induced cholestasis, facilitating automated data collection and the identification of key molecular events.480 Moreover, Bhimsaria and colleagues identified previously hidden binding sites of human NRs via high-throughput SELEX and a novel MinSeq Find algorithm, revealing new biological roles of NRs and their involvement in disease-associated genetic variations while providing a valuable resource for drug repurposing and precision medicine.481 With AI and ML, high-throughput screening (HTS) has become more efficient, enabling better prediction of drug candidates and optimization of lead compounds for clinical applications.",
        "In vivo imaging techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are increasingly used to study nuclear receptor (NR) activity in living organisms. These methods allow real-time tracking of NR signaling and the effects of ligands or drugs on receptor function in tissues. Live-cell imaging with fluorescent biosensors also reveals dynamic interactions between NRs and their co-regulatory proteins at the cellular level.482 This approach offers a quantitative, in vivo equivalent to classic radioligand binding assays.483 In vivo imaging helps identify when and where NRs are active during development, aging, and disease, providing insights into how ligands or receptor modulators influence these processes.484 Other technologies, such as organoids, 3D cell cultures, nanotechnology, and systems biology, have also advanced NR research. Notably, PROTACs (proteolysis-targeting chimeras), which degrade target proteins via the 26S proteasome, offer new possibilities for targeting challenging NRs, including orphan receptors or those without enzymatic activity. In cases of drug resistance due to NR mutations (e.g., in hormone-dependent cancers), PROTACs can bypass resistance by degrading the mutated receptors instead of inhibiting their activity.",
        "Emerging technologies are significantly enhancing the field of nuclear receptor research by providing deeper insights into their structure, function, and regulation. The combination of high-resolution imaging, gene editing tools, and advanced computational techniques has opened new avenues for understanding how NRs control physiological processes and contribute to disease. As these technologies continue to evolve, they hold promise for the development of more precise and effective therapeutic strategies targeting nuclear receptors in a variety of disorders.",
        "Nuclear receptors are a crucial class of transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to various ligands, such as hormones, vitamins and metabolic products. They play pivotal roles in processes such as metabolism, immune responses and development, making them key targets for therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolic disorders and inflammatory conditions. In recent years, targeted therapies aimed at NRs, such as ERs, ARs and VDRs, have shown significant promise in clinical applications, particularly in oncology and metabolic regulation. Newer nuclear receptors, such as LXR and PXR, are being investigated for their therapeutic potential, revealing novel pathways for drug development.",
        "Despite recent advances, several challenges remain in targeting NRs for therapeutic purposes. One key difficulty is the extensive crosstalk between NRs and their signaling pathways, which can lead to synergistic or antagonistic effects, limiting the effectiveness of targeting a single receptor and causing off-target effects. Additionally, NRs exhibit tissue-specific expression and functional outcomes, making designing drugs that selectively modulate receptor activity in specific tissues or cell types challenging. The specificity of ligand-receptor interactions is another hurdle, as NRs can be activated by various small molecules, and ligand promiscuity or cross-reactivity can lead to unwanted side effects. Moreover, long-term NR modulation may result in side effects or even toxicity, such as liver damage or increased cardiovascular risk. Finally, many NRs are regulated by complex feedback mechanisms, complicating predictions about how receptor activity changes in response to treatment. These dynamic regulatory loops require careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences and therapeutic resistance.",
        "Future research will likely focus on understanding the complex interactions of nuclear receptors in various physiological contexts, developing more selective modulators, and exploring novel strategies for more precise and selective targeting of NRs to minimize off-target effects and enhance therapeutic efficacy. Integration of data from transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics will help model NR signaling networks and predict the effects of targeting a specific NR in the context of broader cellular networks. Structure-based drug design employing leverage X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, and computational modeling will facilitate the identification or design of small molecules that specifically interact with a target NR’s ligand-binding domain, minimizing cross-reactivity. Cutting-edge technologies such as gene editing CRISPR/Cas9 technology and advanced drug delivery systems achieve tissue- or cell-specific targeting of NRs to minimize off-target effects and enhance therapeutic efficacy. Noninvasive techniques to monitor the activity of NRs via specifically binding imaging agents to activated nuclear receptors or linking reporter genes (e.g., luciferase, GFP) to NR-responsive promoters will allow real-time visualization and quantification of receptor activity in preclinical models. In addition, the fact that NRs are key host sensors of microbial signals offers a promising avenue for gut microbiota-targeted drug discovery by leveraging NR-mediated environmental adaptations.485–487 For example, FXR plays a pivotal role in modulating the gut microbiota and is thereby involved in various biological processes, including the metformin response,488 bile acid homeostasis,489 and core metabolic functions.490 Overall, with the advancement of these technologies, new breakthroughs will be made in the discovery of novel drugs that target NRs.",
