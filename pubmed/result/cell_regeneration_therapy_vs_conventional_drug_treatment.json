    "title": "Intra-articular human deciduous dental pulp stem cell administration vs. pharmacological therapy in experimental osteoarthritis rat model. morphological effects of diacerein and glucosamine-chondroitin drug treatment and intra-articular injection therapy of human deciduous dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) in a rat knee model of induced osteoarthritis (OA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six adult male rats were randomly separated into six groups: Control group (without induction of OA), osteoarthritis group 60 (induction of OA, saline gavage started on day 14 and performed for 60 days, followed by euthanasia), osteoarthritis group (induction of OA and euthanasia after 14 days), diacerein group, glucosamine-chondroitin group, and mesenchymal stem cell group. The drug-treated groups were gavaged with 50 mg/kg of diacerein and 400/500 mg/kg of glucosamine-chondroitin starting on dat 14 for 60 days. The cell therapy-treated group received an intra-articular single dose of 8 x 105 hDPSCs on day 14, and euthanasia was performed after 60 days. Lateral femoral condyles were collected and prepared for immunohistochemistry and light microscopy procedures. RESULTS: The morphological features and immunoexpression of SOX-5, IHH, MMP-8, MMP-13, and Type II collagen were statistically analysed. Our data suggest that hDPSC therapy contributes more actively and effectively in the structural reorganization of lateral femoral condyles. In contrast, the glucosamine-chondroitin sulphate treatment was more effective in inflammatory control, while diacerein showed better results associated with the maintenance of the primordial cartilage. CONCLUSIONS: The positive therapeutic effect of daily administered conventional drugs can be confirmed in a rat model of OA. However, one single dose of locally administered hDPSCs provides significant improvement in tissue regeneration in an OA model. Paulo, Brazil. maldonado@unifesp.br. 10.26355/eurrev_202105_25837.",

      "abstract": "The objective of the present work was to develop a three-dimensional culture model to evaluate, in a short period of time, cartilage tissue engineering protocols. The spheroids were compared with the gold standard pellet culture. The dental mesenchymal stem cell lines were from pulp and periodontal ligament. The evaluation used RT-qPCR and Alcian Blue staining of the cartilage matrix. This study showed that the spheroid model allowed for obtaining greater fluctuations of the chondrogenesis markers than for the pellet one. The two cell lines, although originating from the same organ, led to different biological responses. Finally, biological changes were detectable for short periods of time. In summary, this work demonstrated that the spheroid model is a valuable tool for studying chondrogenesis and the mechanisms of osteoarthritis, and evaluating cartilage tissue engineering protocols.",

        "Articular cartilage is an avascular tissue with very low self-repair potential after trauma or degenerative disease [1,2]. This limited regeneration capacity can lead to degenerative changes in the traumatized cartilage, which represents a risk factor for the early development of osteoarthritis (OA) [3].",
        "Different strategies have been developed to treat cartilage injuries, such as autologous chondrocyte implantation, microfracture, and mosaicplasty, but they have disadvantages such as donor site morbidity (and consequent osteoarthritic changes in the donor joint) and/or inferior repair as fibrocartilage [1,3,4,5].",
        "Tissue engineering, which aims to restore, maintain, and improve tissue performance by combining stem cells and biomaterial scaffolds, could promote cartilage repair [6,7].",
        "Regarding stem cells, in recent years, Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising cell source for the treatment of various degenerative, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases [5]. Nevertheless, the therapeutic effects of MSCs are increasingly being attributed to paracrine secretion, particularly to nanovesicles called exosomes [8]. Investigation regarding the use of MSC exosomes as cell-free alternatives to MSCs for tissue engineering, particularly bone and cartilage tissue engineering, is increasing [9,10]. Thus, a tissue engineering technique which combines a bioactive glass scaffold with MSC exosomes could promote cartilage repair [11,12].",
        "MSCs are multipotent cells that can differentiate into multiple cell lineages including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, endothelial cells, muscle cells, and neurons [2,13,14,15,16].",
        "In the mentioned context, MSCs have a twofold interest:First, due to their multilineage differentiation potential, they could be differentiated into chondrocytes [1,2].Secondly, their exosomes could be used for cartilage repair [5].",
        "First, due to their multilineage differentiation potential, they could be differentiated into chondrocytes [1,2].",
        "Secondly, their exosomes could be used for cartilage repair [5].",
        "Further, MSCs are known to exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects [17]. MSCs can be isolated from various tissues (bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, skeletal muscle, cartilage, synovium, cardiac tissue, and dental tissue) [18,19,20,21,22] and MSCs differentiation can be influenced by the cell source [23].",
        "Bone marrow MSCs are the most extensively investigated MSCs and are considered as the gold standard. Nevertheless, obtaining them is often painful and carries the risk of infection [13].",
        "Dental MSCs could be the solution to overcome this disadvantage. They are have a very accessible source since they can be isolated during routine dental surgeries [13]. Besides, they have many benefits:They are expandable and have relative genomic stability for a long period of time [18].They can differentiate into multiple lineages including odontoblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes, neurocytes, adipocytes, corneal epithelial cells, and melanocytes [19].The mean doubling time frequency of dental pulp MSCs is comparable to that of bone marrow MSCs [13].The frequency of colony-forming cells from dental pulp is high compared to those from bone marrow [13].They have demonstrated immunomodulatory properties due to secreting cytokines [18].They have been found in various dental tissues (dental pulp, apical papilla, periodontal ligament, gingiva, dental follicle, tooth germ, and alveolar bone) [18].",

        "They have been found in various dental tissues (dental pulp, apical papilla, periodontal ligament, gingiva, dental follicle, tooth germ, and alveolar bone) [18].",
        "All of these features make dental MSCs distinct from the other human MSCs and an effective tool for stem cell therapy [18].",
        "The aim of this study was to develop an effective strategy to differentiate dental MSCs into chondrocytes, using three-dimensional cell cultures as spheroids. Our laboratory studies silicate bioactive glasses in bone and cartilage tissue engineering. Several recent studies have demonstrated the role of bioactive glasses in chondrogenesis and cartilage repair [12,24]. These are, therefore, relevant candidates for osteoarthritis. The objective of this study was to develop a three-dimensional chondrocyte culture model for screening innovative bioactive glasses to evaluate our cartilage tissue engineering experiments and for a mechanobiology model. For this last point, we demonstrated that spheroids were valuable tools for assessing mechanical stress [25].",
        "For this purpose, the chondrogenic differentiation potential of MSCs from two different sources (dental pulp and periodontal ligament) was assessed.",
        "The chondrogenic potential of MSCs cultured in spheroids was compared with that of MSCs cultured in monolayer (negative control) and pellets, pellet cultures being another type of tridimensional cell culture, which is the gold standard for maintaining chondrocytes in a differentiated stage [26].",
        "In this study, two dental cell types were compared: human Dental Pulp Stem Cells (hDPSC) and human Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells (hPDLSC).",
        "hDPSC were obtained by explant culture. Extracted third molars were collected from healthy donors in agreement with French legislation (informed patients and Institutional Review Board approval/Registration number: DC-2012-1573, 19 April 2012). The pulp tissue was extracted from the teeth in an aseptic way, rinsed with Minimum Essential Medium–Alpha Eagle (α-MEM, Lonza, Verviers, Belgium), and explanted in a 35 mm Petri dish at seven 1 mm3 pieces/well. Explants were cultured in a complete culture medium consisting of α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), 2 mmol/L glutamine (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium), 20 mmol/L HEPES (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium), and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) until cells emerged from the explant. These cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.",
        "hPDLSC obtained in the same way in a previous study were used in the present work [27]. Cells were used from passages 3 to 7.",
        "hPDLSC were characterized in a previous study: their MSCs-like characteristics were confirmed (spindle appearance, expression of the markers CD73, CD90, and CD105, no expression of the markers CD34 and CD45, capacity of in vitro differentiation into adipocyte and osteoblast lineages) [27].",
        "The characterization of hDPSC was performed in the same way: first, a phenotypic characterization was done by flow cytometry to investigate the expression of the surface adhesion markers.",
        "Then, a functional characterization was performed:To confirm the stemness of the hDPSC, their ability to form colonies was assessed with the Colony-Forming Assay.Then, to ensure that the hDPSC were still functional, their capacity for in vitro differentiation into adipocyte and osteoblast lineages was evaluated.",

        "Immunophenotypic characterization was performed by flow cytometric analysis. hDPSC were harvested and washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium). BV421 mouse anti-human CD34, FITC mouse anti-human CD45, PE mouse anti-human CD73, PE-Cy7 mouse anti-human CD90, and APC mouse anti-human CD105 were incubated with cells for 15 min in darkness at room temperature (RT). Then, cells were washed with PBS for further analysis. A BD LSRFortessa™ X-20 flow cytometer system (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was used for antigen expression. Antibodies and buffers were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA).",
        "hDPSC were seeded in 6-well plates on the basis of 500 cells/well and cultured in complete medium. On day 10, they were fixed for 30 min at RT with formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, USA) 3.7% in PBS. Crystal violet (0.5% in methanol) was used for 5 min and then samples were washed with distilled water [28]. Colony formation was observed.",
        "To study osteoblastic differentiation, cells were seeded in 6-well plates (5 × 104 cells/mL).

        "Before starting the experiments, it was confirmed that the hDPSC isolated from explant cultures had MSCs-like characteristics. They exhibited a spindle appearance, similar to those of MSCs, and they were plastic-adherent cells.",
        "The cytometric flow analysis revealed the expression of CD73, CD90, and CD105, and no expression of CD34 and CD45.",
        "The hDPSC were able to form colonies 10 days after seeding (Figure 2A). Moreover, the osteoblastic and adipogenic differentiation potentials were confirmed by Alizarin Red staining and Oil Red O staining, respectively.",
        "In fact, the hDPSC produced nodules of mineralization after being cultured with osteogenic medium for 21 days (Figure 2B). Similarly, after 21 days of culture with adipogenic medium, the formation of lipid droplets was observed (Figure 2C).",
        "On day 7, Alcian blue staining was positive in all cultures, except for the monolayer with complete medium. The pellet and spheroids cultures were positive for Alcian blue staining, regardless of the culture medium (Figure 3 and Figure 4).",

        "Changes in cell shape;",
        "Noticeable presence of cartilage extracellular matrix (Figure 3 and Figure 4; arrow).",
        "These changes were more discreet, even absent, in pellets cultures.",
        "The most striking results were the significant increase in Acan and Comp expression in the spheroids of hDPSC cultured with chondrogenic medium compared with those cultured with complete medium, on days 3 and 7.",
        "The same significant increase was observed in the hPDLSC spheroids cultured with chondrogenic medium, except in Acan on day 3 (Figure 5A,B).",
        "In the spheroids with chondrogenic medium, Comp expression was very important, with 128- to 1536-fold increases over complete medium (Table 2 and Table 3).",
        "Acan expression was also very important in the hDPSC spheroids cultured with chondrogenic medium, with 38- to 57-fold increases over complete medium (Table 2).",
        "Regarding pellet culture, Acan expression was increased in the chondrogenic medium only in hDPSC, but the difference was not statistically significant. Comp expression was significantly increased in chondrogenic medium, except for hPDLSC at day 7, where the increase, although not significant, was much lower than in the spheroids (Figure 5A,B, Table 2 and Table 3).",
        "Regarding the monolayer culture, Acan expression was significantly increased in chondrogenic medium compared to complete medium, in both cell lines at days 3 and 7. Acan expression in monolayer with chondrogenic medium was higher in hDPSC compared to hPDLSC, but was much lower than that in the hDPSC spheroids cultured with chondrogenic medium.",
        "Comp expression was significantly increased in the chondrogenic medium only in hDPSC at day 3 and in both cell lines at day 7. Comp expression in the chondrogenic medium was much lower in monolayer compared to the spheroids in both cell lines at days 3 and 7 (Figure 5A,B, Table 2 and Table 3).",
        "At both times, Col2a1 and Sox9 expression was higher in three-dimensional cultures (spheroids and pellets), especially in spheroids, regardless of the culture medium (Figure 5C,D, Table 2 and Table 3).",
        "When comparing the expression of chondrogenic markers in spheroids and pellets cultured with chondrogenic medium to that of the monolayer cultured with chondrogenic medium, the spheroids of hDPSC exhibited increased expression for all markers at both times (Figure 6). The pellets of hDPSC also showed increased expression, except for Acan. In hPDLSC, the increases in expression were lower and did not involve all markers (Figure 6).",
        "The clinical use of MSCs is an attractive therapeutic option, especially due to their multilineage potential and their immunomodulatory properties [32]. MSCs are investigated in many fields, including chronic inflammatory bowel disease [33]; autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases [34]; and tissue engineering [19]. Scaffolds seeded with MSCs are widely studied in bone and cartilage tissue engineering [32]. However, the number of approved MSCs treatments worldwide remains limited [34].",
        "MSCs therapy in OA would be appropriate because of their differentiation capacity and paracrine properties [35]. MSCs clinical trials that have been conducted for OA have used different injection methods: intra-articular injection, combination with a scaffold, or combination with platelet-poor plasma [34]. MSCs are multipotential cells with a high capacity for proliferation and multi-lineage differentiation, such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes [19]. In the present study, a phenotypic characterization (flow cytometry) of dental MSCs was performed, and their ability to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes was confirmed. Besides, since MSCs and fibroblasts are both plastic adherent, share similar cell morphology, and express many similar cell surface proteins [36]; the presence of MSCs rather than fibroblast was verified by the Colony-Forming Assay [37]. Even if bone marrow was the first source reported to contain MSCs, MSCs can be isolated from various tissues, including adipose tissue, umbilical cord, skeletal muscle, cartilage, synovium, cardiac tissue, and dental tissue [18,19,20]. Dental MSCs exhibit many advantages, with the main one being their very easy access [18,20]. Besides, they can be found in various dental tissues [18]. This ease of access makes them very attractive, including for cartilage regeneration, especially since they were already studied on OA models and showed promising results [38,39]. These advantages led us to choose dental MSCs to conduct the present study. Furthermore, since the tissue source can vary the properties of human MSCs [40], we chose to use two cell lines from two different parts of the same organ: dental pulp and periodontal ligament. Indeed, even if MSCs have a dental origin, they have shown different properties depending on their source (dental pulp, periodontal ligament, apical papilla, dental follicle, etc.) [41], which is confirmed by the present study, with hDPSC and hPDLSC exhibiting different gene expression profiles. We chose hDPSC and hPDLSC since both have been reported to differentiate into chondrocyte [13,42]. Besides, both showed a higher number of population doublings than bone marrow MSCs in culture [43] and can be easily isolated from almost all adults [42,44]. Moreover, although dental pulp and periodontal ligament have immunologic, neurologic, pathologic, and circulatory similarities, they have different functions [44].",
        "Our MSC populations were characterized in accordance with the recommendations of the International Society for Cellular Therapy (plastic adherence, expression of the surface markers, lacking the expression of hematopoietic markers, capacity of in vitro differentiation into adipocyte and osteoblast lineages, and fibroblast-like spindle shape in culture) [19,45].",
        "Three-dimensional and high-density cell cultures are needed for chondrogenic differentiation [26] because high cell density cultures mimic the condensation of mesenchymal cells that induces chondrogenesis during development [46]. Most often, chondrogenic differentiation is performed with pellet culture, which is the gold standard to maintain chondrocytes in a differentiated stage [26]. Three-dimensional cultures (spheroids or pellets) have many advantages: when cultured in three dimensions, MSCs maintain their intrinsic phenotypic properties by cell–extracellular matrix interactions [47]. Thus, these culture methods are regarded as more physiological, and better mimic in vivo conditions [48]. Besides, 3D cultures result in a higher expression of paracrine factors, including exosomes [49]. Nevertheless, the spheroid culture system has many advantages over pellet culture, including fewer required cells (5 × 103 cells for one spheroid; 1.25 × 105 cells for one pellet) and ease of handling. Besides, recent studies found that the reduction in pellet size can improve chondrogenesis [50]. At last, the use of spheroids for MSCs transplantation is well documented in tissue engineering, and they have been reported to enhance the overall therapeutic potential of MSCs after transplantation [51], whereas few studies have reported the use of pellets. These advantages led us to choose the spheroid culture system for the present study. A comparison was made with pellet culture. Monolayer culture, with complete and chondrogenic media, was used as negative control. The chondrogenesis of dental pulp stem cells cultured as spheroids has been studied by several authors [52,53,54], but few studies have compared spheroid culture to pellet culture (the gold standard for chondrogenic differentiation). Besides, the methods used for spheroid culture differ in the literature; therefore, one of the objectives of this study was to test the liquid overlay technique.",
        "To investigate chondrogenic differentiation, chondrocyte-specific markers expression was assessed by RT-qPCR. The following markers were evaluated, according to the literature [55]:Aggrecan (Acan), a proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is the major component of cartilage [56].Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (Comp), which is a non-collagenous extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is primarily found in the human skeleton system (articular cartilage, meniscus, ligaments, tendons, and synovium) [57].Type II collagen (Col2a1), which is one of the main components of the ECM of hyaline articular cartilage [58].SRY-related HMG box-containing-9 (Sox9), which is a master transcription factor that regulates multiple events in chondrogenesis. SOX9 is involved in the transactivation of Col2a1 and Acan [58].",
        "Aggrecan (Acan), a proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is the major component of cartilage [56].",
        "Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (Comp), which is a non-collagenous extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is primarily found in the human skeleton system (articular cartilage, meniscus, ligaments, tendons, and synovium) [57].",
        "Type II collagen (Col2a1), which is one of the main components of the ECM of hyaline articular cartilage [58].",
        "SRY-related HMG box-containing-9 (Sox9), which is a master transcription factor that regulates multiple events in chondrogenesis. SOX9 is involved in the transactivation of Col2a1 and Acan [58].",
        "Regarding Acan and Comp markers, their expression was significantly increased when hDPSC were grown as spheroids in chondrogenic medium compared to complete medium, at days 3 and day 7. In hPDLSC, the same results were observed, except for Acan, which was significantly increased only at day 7. Acan was also increased when cells were grown as spheroids in chondrogenic medium compared to complete medium at day 3, but the difference was not significant. This significant increase in expression was very strong for Comp, in both cell lines, and for Acan only in hDPSC. Comp expression was also increased in pellets culture with chondrogenic medium compared with complete medium, at day 3 and day 7 in hDPSC, and only at day 3 in hPDLSC. Nevertheless, its expression was lower than in spheroids, and no increase in Acan expression was observed in pellets. These results show a great potential of spheroid culture for chondrogenic differentiation. The same phenomenon was observed in monolayer, even though the increase in Comp expression was much lower, confirming a great potential of dental MSCs in chondrogenic differentiation.",
        "The Alcian Blue staining results also suggest a great potential of dental MSCs in chondrogenic differentiation, since they were slightly positive in monolayer with chondrogenic medium. Besides, they were also positive in pellet and spheroid cultures in chondrogenic medium, and also in complete medium. Nevertheless, for the 3D culture models (spheroids and pellets), only the spheroids showed changes in cell shape, and the cartilage extracellular matrix clearly appeared. These changes were less obvious for the pellets for this 7-day incubation time. This work will be continued by a quantification of the extracellular matrix using morphometric analysis.",
        "Pellet culture was not the most favorable model for these two cell types for chondrogenic differentiation. In addition, hDPSCs showed better chondrogenic differentiation than hPDLSCs, confirming that dental MSCs have different properties depending on their source [41]. The other markers (Col2a1 and Sox9) did not increase with chondrogenic medium but seemed to increase in three-dimensional cultures (spheroids and pellets), highlighting the need for three-dimensional culture for chondrogenic differentiation. These results are consistent with some studies in the literature: Prideaux et al. developed two multipotent mesenchymal progenitor murine cell lines. In the first one, they found an increase in all chondrogenic markers (Col2a1, Acan, Comp, and Sox9). In the second cell line, only Comp and Sox9 were increased, confirming the results of the present study, in which differences were observed between the cell lines. Besides, as in this study, Prideaux et al. found a very large increase in Comp in cells cultured with chondrogenic medium compared to those cultured in complete medium (about 200-fold) [55]. These results agree with some studies in the literature: in a study by Joanna L. James et al., no increase in Sox9 was observed during chondrogenesis [23]. Similarly, Prideaux et al. generated two cell lines capable of chondrogenic differentiation. One showed an increase in Col2a1 during chondrogenesis, but not the other [55].",
        "In the present study, the Comp marker was strongly increased when cells were cultured as spheroids with chondrogenic medium, compared to all other conditions, at day 3. These results demonstrate that spheroid culture is an excellent model for the chondrogenic differentiation of dental MSCs. In addition to Comp, Acan expression was strongly increased after day 3 in hDPSC spheroids with chondrogenic medium, showing the value of this cell line in chondrogenic differentiation. The results of the present study are consistent with those of Liangming Zhang et al., who found that the spheroid culture system was a promising tool for in vitro chondrogenic studies. In their study, chondrogenic differentiation was investigated at days 7, 14, and 21 [59]. The present study showed that the spheroids of dental MSCs are a comparable or even superior model to the gold standard pellet culture. Although the majority of studies on chondrogenesis showed an optimal result after three or four weeks of culture, the present work demonstrated that, after three and seven days, several markers of chondrocyte differentiation fluctuated. These gene variations are early assessment tools for our three-dimensional chondrocyte cultures and can be used for innovative bioactive glasses and to evaluate our cartilage tissue engineering protocols. The results of the present study were consistent with those of Ji-Yun Ko et al., who showed chondrogenic differentiation as early as day 3 on adipose-derived stromal/stem cells grown in spheroids [60].",
        "It is well known that tissue source can vary the exact properties of human MSCs [40]. In the present study, hDPSC showed better results for chondrogenic differentiation, compared to hPDLSC. Moreover, hDPSC spheroids cultured with chondrogenic medium were the best condition for chondrogenic differentiation. In fact, they were the only ones that showed an increased expression of all markers compared to the negative control. Thus, these results showed that, although derived from the same organ, these two cell lines exhibited different properties. Besides, it can be concluded that hDPSC are the most interesting cell line to develop a chondrocyte model for bioactive glass screening in tissue engineering. This work should be continued in order to confirm the value of dental MSC spheroids in chondrogenic differentiation, and then to study their interest in cartilage tissue engineering.",
        "The present study showed strong potential for the chondrogenic differentiation of dental MSCs from the third day of culture.",
        "The spheroid culture system using the liquid overlay technique is an excellent model to obtain spheroids of homogeneous size for chondrogenic differentiation.",
        "The very easy access and the multiple sources available make dental MSCs attractive for chondrogenic differentiation.",
        "Dental MSCs exhibit different properties according to their tissue source. In this study, hDPSC showed better chondrogenic differentiation than hPDLSC.",

    "title": "A Single-Center Pilot Prospective Study of Topical Application of Platelet-Derived Eye Drops for Patients with Ocular Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease. that occurs in up to 60% of patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Conventional therapeutic options include medical and surgical procedures that are administered depending on the severity of the condition, but most of them have provided unsatisfactory results and, to date, there is no consensus about treatment. We considered that topical application of a platelet lysate, administered as eye drops, might be considered an alternative worthwhile of investigation to treat ocular surface disorders in patients suffering from cGVHD. Therefore, we conducted a single-center prospective pilot study to assess the efficacy and safety of using eye drops made from reconstituted lysed platelet concentrate. Twenty-six patients with ocular cGVHD were eligible for the study; all but 2 completed their scheduled 1-year treatment and complied with the hematologic and ophthalmic regimen. At their first assessment interviews, after 30 days of treatment, 91% of patients reported an improvement in their symptoms and for 32%, substantive objective differences were measured. Remission of corneal damage was seen for 86% of our cohort, and improved National Institutes of Health scores for 73%, of whom 8% achieved the best score of 0 (ie, non-dry eye). Similar results were seen at later time points. Comparing outcomes for our patient cohort to those determined retrospectively for patients in our institutional database revealed a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 65%. This OS is comparable to patients with limited cGVHD (75%) and is superior to that of patients with nonocular extensive cGVHD or without cGVHD (30% and 59%, respectively) (P = .013). Our results suggest that platelet-derived eye drops are a safe, practical, and well-tolerated therapeutic option that offers substantial benefits for most patients affected by ocular cGVHD at onset. The favorable OS of our patient cohort suggests that this topical therapy, rather than systemic immunosuppression, may be the treatment of choice. by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Italy.

        "Topical biological agents offer a promising therapy for various ocular surface diseases, especially when conventional treatments are insufficient. Derived from natural sources, these agents—such as autologous and allogeneic serum, platelet derivatives, amniotic membrane extracts, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)—leverage biological molecules to promote tissue repair and regeneration.[12] Autologous serum drops, rich in growth factors, vitamins, and proteins, have shown significant efficacy in treating ocular surface disorders such as dry eye and neurotrophic keratopathy.[3] Similarly, topical platelet derivatives, including platelet-rich plasma (PRP), plasma-rich growth factors (PRGFs), and platelet lysate (PL), have demonstrated their role in accelerating wound healing and tissue regeneration.[45] Amniotic membrane extract, with its anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties, has proven effective in managing chronic corneal ulcers and post-surgical corneal epithelial healing.[6] More recently, IVIG, owing to its immune-modulating properties, has been employed topically for treating dry eye disease of various aetiologies.[7] This review explores the mechanisms, indications, and clinical outcomes of topical biological treatments, highlighting their growing role in modern ophthalmic care.",
        "A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases. The following keywords were used as follows: topical, autologous, serum, amniotic, membrane, extract, platelet, immunoglobulin, and lysate. Relevant review articles, original articles, case series, and case reports were reviewed. The search was conducted in October 2024. We limited our search to articles published from 1975 to 2024 and were written in English.",
        "Human tear film is rich in biologically active growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF). These factors play key roles in cellular proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival.[8] The proposed benefits of blood-derived topical agents arise from their composition, which closely resembles that of human tears, in contrast to artificial tears that primarily provide lubrication. The use of blood-derived products such as eye drops was pioneered by Ralph et al.[9] in 1975, who utilized a continuous ocular perfusion pump to deliver undiluted autologous and homologous serum in patients with chemical burns, chronic viral keratitis, and ocular pemphigoid. Fox et al.[10] later reported using diluted autologous serum to treat refractory keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Over the years, several types of blood-derived products have been explored for topical therapy. These can be of autologous origin, such as serum, PRP, PRGFs, and PL, or of allogeneic origin, such as peripheral blood serum, umbilical cord serum, and topical immunoglobulin.",
        "Autologous serum (AS) eye drops, derived from a patient’s own blood, are the most commonly used blood-based topical biological agent. The composition of AS closely resembles that of human tears but contains higher levels of vitamin A, lysozyme, TGF-β, and fibronectin, while IgA, EGF, and vitamin C are lower.[1112]",
        "Topical AS primarily functions through three main mechanisms: lubrication, improved epithelial healing, and reduced inflammation. It is rich in growth factors, vitamins, and fibronectin, essential for the growth and repair of the ocular surface epithelium. Beyond promoting epithelization, the serum contains neurotrophic factors (NGF, IGF, and substance P) that enhance corneal sensitivity[1314] and nerve structure recovery.[315] Anti-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonists and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, help reduce ocular surface inflammation that indirectly enhances epithelial viability.[1617] Furthermore, albumin in the serum prevents cell death in conjunctival cells, while its antimicrobial components—lysozyme, lactoferrin, and immunoglobulins—reduce the risk of infection.[18]",
        "There is no standardized protocol for the preparation, processing, or storage of AS eye drops, and various methods have been described in the literature.[1114161819202122] Most authors follow a protocol based on the one outlined by Liu et al.[11] In this method, 100 mL of the patient’s blood is collected into sterile containers, followed by routine virology screening. The blood is then left to stand at room temperature for 2 hours before being centrifuged at 3,000 × g. The serum supernatant is transferred to disposable syringes under sterile conditions in a laminar airflow hood, following which it is diluted 1:4 with balanced salt solution (BSS) and aliquoted into sterile dropper bottles. The prepared eye drops are stored at −20°C for up to 3 months. Once opened, the bottle is stored at +4°C and discarded after 16 hours of use as per the original protocol.[11] While it is generally recommended to store AS at −20°C for 3 months, studies show that epitheliotropic properties remain stable for up to 6 months at this temperature.[23] A closed manufacturing system, designed to ensure sterility and reduce contamination risk, has also been described.[17] In addition to BSS, agents such as normal saline, hyaluronic acid, and antibiotics, have been used to dilute AS. Serum diluted with BSS was found to promote epithelial cell growth more effectively than isotonic saline.[11] Better outcomes were reported with AS diluted in hyaluronate, in terms of improved tear stability and symptoms, requiring fewer drops, and better tolerance.[24] However, another report found no benefit of dilution with 0.3% hyaluronate and observed poorer outcomes when AS was diluted with antibiotics, possibly due to toxicity.[21] Table 1 provides an overview of the various protocols described in the literature for preparing AS eye drops.",
        "Protocols for preparation of autologous serum eyedrops in ocular surface disorders",
        "SOP – standard operating procedure; rpm – revolutions per minute",
        "Concentrations of AS drops used clinically range from 20% to 100%. Since the serum is rich in TGF-β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, a 20% concentration is often recommended to reduce its levels similar to those in natural tears.[1825] Higher concentrations (33–100%) have been used in severe cases.[2627] The recommended frequency of instillation ranges from every 2–3 hours to every 6 hours. However, most studies suggest frequent instillation due to the short duration of the physiological effect of the serum drops on the ocular surface.",
        "AS eye drops have been found to be an effective adjunct in treating a range of ocular conditions, particularly those involving poor epithelial healing and corneal nerve dysfunction. They have been widely used for severe dry eye, Sjögren’s syndrome, ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), post-surgical dry eye, recurrent corneal erosions, persistent epithelial defects (PEDs), limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), and corneal neuropathic pain.[325282930]",
        "The major benefits of AS treatment include faster corneal epithelial healing, better tear film stability, and symptomatic relief. Studies have shown significant improvements in both objective measures (tear film stability, corneal staining) and subjective symptoms, particularly in refractory or severe dry eye cases.[3132333435] In Sjögren’s syndrome, AS provides symptomatic relief and enhances ocular surface health[1516193637] with higher concentrations showing greater benefit in more severe cases and a longer treatment duration being required for sustained results.[2136] For post-surgical dry eye, AS accelerates healing and restores visual acuity, particularly in laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and penetrating keratoplasty patients.[3839404142] Furthermore, AS is effective in reducing symptomatic episodes in cases of recurrent corneal erosions.[4344] AS demonstrated higher success rates and faster healing times compared to conventional treatments for PEDs.[25262745464748] Combining AS with bandage contact lenses also proved to be beneficial. AS was also found to be a useful adjunct in ocular reconstruction surgery and treating aniridic keratopathy, contact lens-associated LSCD, glaucoma surgery, and drug-induced LSCD.[26474950515253545556] AS drops were effective in treating photoallodynia in patients suffering from corneal neuropathic pain.[5758] Table 2 summarizes the clinical outcomes of AS eye drops in ocular surface disorders.",
        "Clinical outcomes of autologous serum eye drops in ocular surface disorders",
        "AS – autologous serum; GVHD – graft-versus-host disease; TBUT – tear break-up time, LASIK – laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis; LINE – LASIK-induced neurotrophic epitheliopathy; AAK – aniridia-associated keratopathy; LSCD – limbal stem cell deficiency; PED – persistent epithelial defect; SJS – Stevens-Johnson syndrome",
        "Adverse Effects: Adverse events related to AS eye drops are rare, with the more commonly reported side effects being ocular discomfort, redness, watering, itching, reduced sensitivity, lid swelling, conjunctivitis, and sticky sensation.[275960] Less frequently, immune complex deposition, sterile infiltrates on the cornea, and albumin deposits on contact lenses have been observed.[21275061] Microbial keratitis, though an extremely rare occurrence, has been reported typically in the presence of risk factors such as PED, contact lens use, or improper storage of the serum.[2762]",
        "Despite its effectiveness, AS eye drops present certain challenges, including potential variability in composition due to the patient’s systemic status and preparation process.[18] Autoimmune conditions like Sjögren’s syndrome and GVHD can elevate inflammatory cytokines in tears and serum, potentially reducing treatment efficacy, especially in secondary Sjögren’s syndrome.[37] However, most studies suggest autoimmune disorders do not significantly impact the clinical outcomes and epitheliotropic properties of AS.[63646566] Composition of AS is also affected by preparation factors like centrifugation time and g-force, with longer clotting times and higher g-force enhancing levels of beneficial growth factors.[216] Other limitations include microbial contamination risks, the need for cold storage, frequent blood draws, and high processing costs.[19]",
        "While the AS is effective for treating severe dry eye symptoms, its use may be limited by challenges such as poor venous access, low hemoglobin levels, hematological disorders, use of anticoagulants, and age-related issues, which can make blood collection difficult.[67] Additionally, serum from patients with Sjögren’s syndrome or GVHD may contain elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators which could have deleterious effects on the ocular surface. Systemic factors, such as immunosuppression in rheumatoid arthritis or chronic kidney failure patients, may also reduce the epitheliotropic properties of the serum, requiring higher concentrations for optimal results.[6468] Furthermore, preparing AS eye drops often involves significant waiting times, which can delay treatment. Allogeneic serum overcomes the challenges of AS by allowing collection and processing in advance, thus ensuring immediate availability.[69]",
        "While the method of preparing allogeneic serum eyedrops is similar to that described for AS, drops careful donor selection and screening are crucial, and informed consent from the donor is mandatory.[6069] Despite theoretical risks like immune reactions from ABO mismatches or HLA antibodies, on using allogeneic serum eyedrops, clinical use shows that ABO compatibility is not needed, with no hypersensitivity being observed.[7071] To further reduce these risks, male donors without transfusion history and AB blood group are preferred. ABO-specific allogeneic serum from volunteer male donors may also be used.[5972] A four-month quarantine and re-testing of the donor serum before use minimize risks of infection transmission. Unlike AS, allogeneic serum can be used for multiple patients.[69]",
        "Studies have demonstrated that the efficacy and safety of allogeneic serum eye drops are comparable to AS for conditions such as severe dry eye, PED, and ocular GVHD, making it a more convenient and accessible alternative when AS is unavailable or unsuitable.[6769727374] This has led to increasing use of allogeneic serum eye drops, particularly those sourced from voluntary AB blood type donors.[7576] Since 2003, 47% of patients in New Zealand receiving serum eye drop treatments have used allogeneic serum, with 30% receiving only allogeneic drops and 17% receiving a combination of both autologous and allogeneic serum.[76]",
        "Umbilical cord blood serum (CBS), collected during vaginal or cesarean deliveries, offers an alternative to peripheral blood serum eye drops. Studies have reported higher concentrations of growth factors like EGF, TGF-β, NGF, and VEGF in CBS compared to peripheral blood serum.[77787980]",
        "CBS requires informed consent and screening of the donor for viral diseases (HIV and Hepatitis B and C), at the time of delivery. Additional testing for HIV at the time of delivery is required if more than 6 months have passed between testing and serum preparation.[81] Higher concentrations of EGF were associated with younger mothers (<30 years), longer labor (>6 hours), and higher CD34+ cell counts, as well as female sex and higher baby birth weight.[8283]",
        "Cord blood is collected from the umbilical vein under sterile conditions, without using an anticoagulant. The blood is allowed to clot (for 30 minutes to 2 hours) at room temperature before centrifugation, which is then typically performed at 1500–3000 rpm for 5–15 minutes. The serum is then separated and diluted to a 20% concentration, using sterile saline or BSS. The diluted serum is stored at −20°C, with microbiological culture tests conducted for each batch. After thawing, the serum is stored at 4°C, and patients are instructed to use an opened bottle within 7 days or a maximum of 3 months for unopened bottles.[78848586] The frequency of instillation ranges from 4 to 10 times a day.",
        "The use of CBS has been reported to be effective in treating a variety of ocular conditions, including recalcitrant dry eye disease,[78878889] neurotrophic keratitis,[90] recurrent corneal erosions,[91] PED,[808492] ocular GVHD,[79] Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS),[93] acute chemical burns,[85] and post-surgical epithelial healing following corneal laser ablation, penetrating keratoplasty, and vitrectomy.[949596] Studies found CBS to be more effective than peripheral blood serum for moderate-to-severe dry eye, in terms of reducing corneal epithelial damage, improving symptoms, and restoring corneal nerve fiber properties.[81868897] Sharma et al. found that CBS accelerated epithelial healing and improved corneal clarity in chemical burn patients.[85] However, a recent study found comparable outcomes between CBS and AS for dry eye disease with a lower concentration of growth factors in CBS.[98]",
        "Platelets are a rich source of biologically active molecules, including PDGF, EGF, FGF, TGF, NGF, IGF, and cytokines and chemokines that are stored in the alpha granules.[4] Platelet activation or rupture releases these growth factors. The major autologous blood-derived platelet preparations used to treat ocular surface disorders are PRP, PRGF, and PL, differing in platelet concentration and preparation methods.[5]",
        "PRP is the primary platelet preparation, with a higher platelet concentration than whole blood, serving as a foundation for other platelet-derived products. PRP is rich in growth factors and has been used for aiding tissue regeneration across various medical fields.[99] PRGFs are a variant of PRP that lacks leucocytes, and activation with calcium chloride induces the release of biologically active proteins.[100] PL is similar to PRP but activated by a freeze-thaw process to facilitate the lysis of platelets, releasing a higher concentration of growth factors.[101]",
        "PRP’s high-platelet concentration leads to the release of growth factors and cytokines upon platelet aggregation and stimulation. These factors promote epithelial and mesenchymal cell migration and proliferation, aiding in the repair of damaged ocular surfaces.[99] Additionally, PRP provides lubrication, anti-inflammatory effects, and antibacterial peptides. Activation occurs at the site of application, ensuring a slow release of growth factors which prolongs the therapeutic effect. However, PRP’s high leucocyte content may also release pro-inflammatory cytokines, potentially exacerbating local inflammation.[102103]",
        "Platelet-rich plasma: PRP eye drops preparation in ophthalmology typically follows single-step or two-step centrifugation methods. In the single-step centrifugation method, blood is collected with sodium citrate, centrifuged at 1400 rpm, and PRP is separated. The final product is stored in amber glass bottles at −20°C for up to 3 months. The resulting PRP typically contains 1.6–2.5 times the platelet concentration found in whole blood.[102] In a modification of this method, blood is centrifuged at 1600 rpm, resulting in the separation of three layers: platelet-poor plasma at the top, PRP in the middle, and red/white blood cells at the bottom. The PRP layer is then aspirated and transferred into sterilized amber glass bottles.[103]",
        "Plasma-rich growth factors: PRGFs are produced using a closed technique, as described by Anitua et al. Blood is collected with trisodium citrate and centrifuged at 580 g at room temperature using an Endoret System centrifuge (BTI Biotechnology Institute, Spain). The PRGFs are extracted, avoiding the buffy coat, activated, and incubated at 37°C. It is then heat-treated to remove immunologic components and stored at −20°C for up to 3 months.[104105106107]",
        "Platelet Lysate: PL is essentially PRP activated through a freeze-thaw process. The platelet concentrate is frozen at −80°C, then thawed to 37°C. The resulting lysate is diluted to a 30% concentration using sterile BSS and aliquoted into ready-to-use, sterile doses.[3108] Multiple freeze-thaw cycles have also been described. Commercially available human platelet lysate preparations include UltraGRO™ (Helios, Atlanta, GA) and PLTMax (Mill Creek, Rochester, MI).[109] Table 3 details the properties and preparation of different platelet-derived eye drops.",
        "Platelet-derived eye drops – properties, preparation and mechanism of action",
        "Platelet-derived topical agents have emerged as promising treatments for various ocular surface disorders, such as moderate-to-severe dry eye, Sjögren’s syndrome, ocular GVHD, post-LASIK dry eye, PEDs, dormant ulcers, neurotrophic keratopathy, recurrent corneal erosions, chemical burns, and ligneous conjunctivitis.[4110]",
        "Studies report improvements in subjective symptoms, dry eye-related signs, and visual acuity with platelet-derived eye drops and injections in patients with moderate-to-severe dry eye and Sjögren’s syndrome. PRP has been found superior to lubricant drops in comparative studies.[111112113114115116117] PRP eye drops were comparable to AS in treating dry eye in both Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) and non-SS patients, whether used undiluted or diluted, presenting an effective alternative to AS.[118119120121] Conditions such as ocular GVHD may require longer treatment durations up to 6–12 months.[101108122] PL eye drops have been shown to improve corneal nerve morphology and basal epithelial cell density in SS patients.[115] While PRP eye drops have been most extensively studied, many studies stored PRP drops at −20°C and instructed patients to keep them at 4°C. This inevitably leads to thawing and platelet lysis, making the drops behave more like PL than true PRP.[4]",
        "Platelet-derived topical agents have also been explored for treating PEDs caused by neurotrophic factors, herpetic infections, immunologic conditions, post-corneal surgery, and chemical burns.[123124125126127128129] Complete epithelialization was observed in 50% to 85% of cases of neurotrophic keratopathy. Symptomatic improvement occurred in over 90% of cases, with visual acuity improving in more than 60%[123125] and about 60% of post-surgical PEDs.[128129] Notably, PRP was found to promote faster epithelial healing in post-microbial keratitis PEDs compared to AS.[126] Table 4 summarizes the clinical outcomes of various ocular surface disorders treated with platelet-derived eye drops.",

        "The human amniotic membrane is used to treat various ocular surface conditions, including dry eye disease, PEDs, neurotrophic keratitis, SJS, chemical burns, LSCD, and ocular surface reconstruction, owing to its anti-inflammatory, regenerative, and antimicrobial properties.[130] However, amniotic membrane transplantation carries potential drawbacks, such as a decrease in vision, post-surgical discomfort, and risks such as infection and tissue degradation. To address these limitations, derivatives such as amniotic membrane extract drops (AMED) and human amniotic fluid (HAF) drops have been investigated.[131] Moreover, AMED and AF when applied as eye drops allow prolonged treatment if required. More recently, human amniotic epithelial stem cell eye drops have been explored for the treatment of ocular GVHD.[132]",
        "Human amniotic derivatives, such as AMED and AF, share the antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and tissue-regenerative properties of the amniotic membrane. AMED is rich in growth factors like EGF, HGF, FGF, protease inhibitors, and the matrix component HC-HA/PTX3. These biomolecules promote corneal epithelial migration, adhesion, and differentiation while preventing apoptosis. They also downregulate inflammatory markers, reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and prevent angiogenesis and scarring.[131133] Processed HAF possesses these beneficial properties and has been used for treating ocular surface disorder.[134]",
        "Amniotic membrane extract eye drops: AMED is essentially a homogenized suspension derived from an amniotic membrane. Different methods have been described for preparing AMED, using either cryopreserved or fresh amniotic membranes. Amniotic membrane is obtained from the placentas of seronegative donors undergoing elective cesarean delivery after obtaining informed consent. Baradaran et al.[135] used cryopreserved amniotic membrane, processing it with antibiotics, freezing, grinding, and centrifuging to obtain AMEED, applied at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Bonci et al.[136] used a simpler method that homogenized cryopreserved amniotic membrane with BSS and antibiotics. Sabater-Cruz et al.[137] prepared lyophilized AME from fresh amniotic membrane that could be reconstituted before use, offering the advantage of storage at room temperature. Commercially available lyophilized amniotic membrane extracts include AMX and FloGraft. Cheng et al. described the preparation of a morselized amniotic membrane and umbilical cord blood eye drops.[138] The method used to process the amniotic membrane can influence the composition of the extract. Pulverizing the membrane increased the level of growth factors (HGF) by 20% compared to homogenizing it. Additionally, centrifuging the extract up to three times nearly doubled the amount of growth factors and proteins in the final product.[139] Table 5 details the various methods described for producing AMED.",

        "Human Amniotic Fluid Eye Drops: HAF is obtained from seronegative volunteer donors undergoing cesarean deliveries, following the thorough screening. The collected fluid is stored at 2–8°C until processing. It is then centrifuged at 1400 g for 20 minutes at 4°C, and the resulting supernatant is filtered through a 0.2 mm filter to sterilize and remove cellular debris, ensuring a purified final product.[134]",
        "The frequency of AMED instillation ranges from once an hour to twice a day, with more frequent use recommended for indications such as chemical burns and wound healing disorders.[6] Baradaran et al. used a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, though concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 mg/mL have been shown to effectively promote limbal stem cell proliferation.[135140] Studies on processed HAF have typically involved instillation four times a day for short durations, usually around one week.[134]",
        "AMED has been effectively used to treat a range of ocular surface conditions, including dry eye, neurotrophic keratopathy, delayed epithelial healing, chemical burns, and post-photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) recovery [Table 6]. In cases of delayed healing, complete epithelization is achieved in most cases with treatment durations ranging from 4 weeks to 7 months.[136137141142]",

        "AMED – amniotic membrane extract drops; PRK – photorefractive keratectomy",
        "For dry eye, AMEED has shown improvements in both symptoms and signs in more than 80% of patients, though longer treatment may be required for chronic cases.[137141143] In chemical injuries, AMED promotes faster healing in acute cases; in chronic injuries while it may reduce the size of the defect, complete healing may not be achieved.[144] It also aids in faster epithelial recovery in post-PRK patients and supplements in vivo limbal stem cell cultivation in autologous stem cell transplantation, leading to quicker epithelialization compared to conventional treatments.[135140145] Processed HAF has been studied to evaluate its impact on epithelial healing following corneal surface ablation and in patients with severe dry eye. Short-term treatment (1 week) of severe dry eye patients with processed AF (FloGraft, Applied Biologics Scottsdale, AZ USA) mixed in artificial tears and contact lenses soaked in the AF was found to improve symptoms and corneal staining in about 50% of the patients.[146] In patients undergoing PRK, processed AF offered a mild advantage in terms of uncorrected visual acuity and corneal irregularity at 1 month; however, this was not sustained, and all outcome measures were comparable with that of the conventional treatment group on later follow-ups.",
        "Adverse Effects – Reported adverse effects with AMED are infrequent and include non-significant symptoms such as burning sensation, ocular discomfort, and irritation.[134141143147] No major adverse effects have been reported with AF treatment till now.",
        "Recent studies suggest that dry eye disease involves self-antigen-driven autoimmune inflammation, in addition to the conventional T-cell mediated pathway. Elevated IgG levels have been found in the tear fluid of dry eye patients, contrasting with the IgA predominance in healthy tear films. Furthermore, neutrophil-derived products, such as extracellular traps (NETs) and citrullinated proteins, as well as anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), are elevated in the ocular surface washings of dry eye patients. These ACPAs contribute to chronic inflammation. Ocular surface immunoglobulin (OSIG) has shown the potential to reduce this autoimmune inflammation.[7] OSIG has immunomodulatory activity that can potentially reduce this autoimmune-mediated inflammation.",
        "OSIG is hypothesized to exert its effects through multiple pathways, modulating immune responses on the ocular surface to reduce inflammation and autoimmunity in dry eye disease. Autoantibody receptors on dendritic cells and neutrophils of the ocular surface can trigger immune responses. OSIG may block these receptors, limiting the harmful effects of autoantibodies. It contains anti-idiotypic antibodies that neutralize autoantibodies and reduce their production by binding to autoreactive B lymphocytes. Additionally, OSIG neutralizes ACPAs and inhibits NET formation. Other proposed mechanisms include complement inhibition, cytokine modulation, dendritic cell-mediated T-cell activation inhibition, and the expansion of regulatory T-cells.[7]",
        "OSIG is prepared by diluting commercially available intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) like flebogamma DIF 5% in saline to a 0.4% concentration. This formulation is stable at room temperature for up to 2 years. Unlike commercially available pooled human IVIG, which does not require specialized compounding, autologous or allogeneic serum preparations—while essentially physiological IgG formulations—have a shorter shelf life and need to be prepared in specialized compounding pharmacies. Moreover, pooled human OSIG contains anti-idiotypic antibodies against human autoantibodies, which may exert an immunosuppressive effect in autoimmune diseases. However, anti-idiotypic antibodies are rarely found in IgG prepared from individual normal donors, implying that while IVIG eye drops contain anti-idiotypic antibodies, serum eye drops do not.[7]",
        "The topical application of IVIG is expected to achieve a higher concentration on the ocular surface. Studies have used a 0.4% (4 mg/mL) concentration of IVIG, based on the assumption that it provides a similar amount of IVIG as 50% AS eye drops.[7]",
        "OSIG has emerged as a promising addition to the topical biological therapy arsenal for DED. A pilot study evaluating its outcomes in dry eye patients, including oGVHD and autoimmune dry eye disease, found that 0.4% OSIG significantly improved ocular surface staining, symptom scores, and tear inflammatory mediators after 8 weeks compared to a vehicle treatment.[7]",
        "Adverse Effects: In vitro and animal studies have shown that 0.4% OSIG formulation is safe for topical use. The human study also reported no significant adverse effects, though the potential for infectious agent transmission remains, as IVIG is derived from pooled human plasma.[7]",
        "We evaluated the use of topical autologous PL drops as an adjunct therapy for refractory dry eye disease in chronic ocular GVHD patients. Cases with dry eyes diagnosed within six months of chronic ocular GVHD, responded quickly to treatment, with improvement seen within 30 days. By six months, 75% of eyes achieved the least severity grading of dry eyes, and 75% no longer required topical steroids. There was a significant reduction in hyperemia, with 87.5% of participants showing symptomatic improvement. Ocular surface measures, including tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer’s test, and staining scores, improved by six months. Tear analysis showed no significant changes in total protein and MMP-9 levels post-treatment.",
        "We also evaluated the use of topical OSIG to treat various causes of dry eye disease, including ocular GVHD, autoimmune dry eye, meibomian, and SJS over a 12-month period. We observed significant improvements in symptom scores and ocular surface staining at 3 months, sustained up to 12 months. In comparison, the control group showed some improvement at 6 months, but the results were less pronounced. Both groups exhibited reduced conjunctival hyperemia, TBUT, and dry eye severity scores, but the improvements were more significant in the OSIG-treated group. Additionally, OSIG treatment led to a reduced need for topical lubricants and steroids. Only a few complications were noted, including anterior uveitis and microbial keratitis; however, these were unrelated to OSIG use, as cultures confirmed no contamination in the OSIG preparation.",
        "Ocular surface disease treatment is shifting toward advanced biologics and recombinant drugs. One promising example is cenergermin, a recombinant form of NGF, which has shown efficacy in treating neurotrophic keratitis.[148] In addition to established therapies, newer drugs are on the horizon that could further revolutionize treatment paradigms. Emerging treatments such as tanafaercept, a TNF-α inhibitor, and topical anakinra, an IL-1 antagonist, were found to reduce inflammation and improve ocular surface health.[149] Furthermore, human recombinant HGF and CSB-001 have shown promise in enhancing epithelial regeneration and improving ocular surface healing.[150] As these innovative therapies continue to undergo clinical trials, they hold the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes, particularly for those with chronic or refractory ocular conditions. The integration of these new biologics into clinical practice will likely provide more targeted, effective treatments, shifting the paradigm toward more personalized, regenerative approaches for managing ocular surface disorders.",

The mdx mouse is a unique animal for studies of muscle regeneration, and models the disease of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The goals of this study were to determine the potential of 1H NMR spectroscopy as an alternative to conventional histology in monitoring: (1) normal growth in control muscle and the progression of dystrophy in mdx muscle, and (2) beneficial treatments (glucocorticoids) on mdx dystrophy. Ex vivo 1H NMR spectra of limb and diaphragm muscles were obtained from different ages of control and mdx mice, and from mice which were treated with prednisone or deflazacort. Peaks with contributions from creatine, taurine and lipids were examined. Lower levels of taurine and creatine characterized predystrophy and active dystrophy intervals in mdx muscle compared to control. Levels of taurine increased with stabilization of the disease by repair. A measure of accumulated muscle repair, fiber centronucleation and many spectral peaks were highly and significantly correlated. Greater amounts of lipids were found in the diaphragm compared to limb spectra. Treatment of dystrophy, which improved muscle phenotype, resulted in greater levels of taurine and creatine, especially in the limb muscle. Therefore, 1H NMR differentially discriminates: (1) control and mdx muscle; (2) the progression of mdx dystrophy and developmental stages in normal growth; (3) mild and severe dystrophic phenotypes (diaphragm vs limb); and (4) changes associated with improved muscle phenotype and regeneration (due to treatment or injury). The results focus on monitoring muscle repair, not degeneration. We conclude that 1H NMR is a reliable tool in the objective investigation of muscle repair status during muscular dystrophy.

We therefore hypothesised that endogenous levels of taurine are a key determinate in potential taurine treatment efficacy. Because of this, we felt it important to measure taurine levels in DMD patient plasma samples and showed that in non-ambulant patients (but not in younger patients) there was a deficiency of taurine.

        "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal, X-chromosome-linked muscle disease affecting about 1 in 3500–6000 boys worldwide (Reviewed in [1,2,3]). DMD is characterised by severe skeletal muscle loss caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, resulting in defects or the absence of functional dystrophin protein in muscle. Dystrophin deficiency increases susceptibility to sarcolemma damage after muscle contraction, leading to myofibre necrosis (myonecrosis) associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, and subsequent myogenesis and regeneration plus fibrosis [4,5,6,7,8]. Repeated cycles of widespread myonecrosis result in the loss of muscle function in DMD patients, with premature death often due to respiratory or cardiac failure occurring usually by the third or fourth decade of life (reviewed in [1,9,10]).",
        "There is currently no cure or effective treatment for DMD; research into therapies for DMD has focused on strategies to replace the missing dystrophin protein and on drugs to protect the dystrophic muscles from necrosis and reduce the severe dystropatholgy [10]. These drugs include anti-inflammatory agents, antioxidants, and drugs that target calcium homeostasis and fibrosis [10]. Most DMD preclinical drug research has utilised the classic mdx mouse, which has a naturally occurring mutation in the dystrophin gene [11,12]. In this widely used mdx mouse model, dystropathology is relatively mild and varies across the lifespan with an acute onset and peak of myonecrosis between about 21 and 28 days; after this growth period myonecrosis is reduced by about 8–12 weeks of age and stabilises to a progressive low level [13,14,15,16,17].",
        "Taurine is an amino acid with many functions in tissue including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [18]; our laboratory and several others have tested taurine in the mdx mouse with much success [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. These combined studies showed that taurine treatment has a wide range of benefits on mdx dystropathology, including decreased myonecrosis and improved muscle strength [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28] and that mdx muscle and plasma is deficient in taurine, relative to normal control wild-type (WT) levels, particularly during this early growth period of active myonecrosis [19,20,27,29,30,31,32]. We have similarly shown a deficiency of plasma taurine in the golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dog model for DMD, that has a much more severe phenotype that closely resembles the pronounced dystropathology of DMD patients [33]. The GRMD dog model also exhibits high levels of oxidative stress and inflammation and would be an ideal candidate for further preclinical trials of taurine to progress this research to clinical trials [33,34]. However, preclinical trials in GMRD dogs are very expensive, variability between animals is high, and colonies are limited. Therefore, in order to advance our preclinical studies testing the potential of taurine as a therapy for DMD, we examined two other models of DMD that are considered to have a more severe phenotype than the mdx mouse. The dmdpc2 zebrafish contains a nonsense mutation in exon 32 of the dmd gene, rendering it non-functional: these fish display a severe dystrophic phenotype [35] and are a powerful research tool for large scale and rapid screening of therapeutic drugs for DMD [35,36,37]. Another model investigated was the DMDmdx rat, which was developed using transcription activator-like effector nucleases to target exon 23 of the dmd gene [38,39]. Normal rats are about 10 times larger than mice with a similar lifespan and the DMDmdx rats appear to have a more severe and progressive dystropathology (compared with mdx mice) that more closely resembles the DMD patients, with sustained muscle necrosis, more pronounced fibrosis and adipose tissue, loss of strength, earlier changes in heart and nerves, and a reduced lifespan [38,40,41,42].",
        "We have proposed that cells of the immune system, particularly activated neutrophils, exacerbate dystropathology, specifically because hypochlorous acid (HOCl) a potent reactive oxygen species is generated from myeloperoxidase (MPO) produced by neutrophils [33], and that the antioxidant effects of taurine in mdx mice are a consequence of taurine ameliorating the production, or effects, of HOCl [8,20]. Therefore, one aim of this study in DMDmdx rats was to establish whether taurine treatment ameliorated oxidative stress and reduced the severity of dystropathology in dystrophic rat muscle. Taurine was administered to young male DMDmdx rats aged 4 weeks for 8 weeks. Unexpectedly, taurine levels were higher in untreated DMDmdx rats in both plasma and muscle, compared with WT normal rats, and taurine treatment of DMDmdx rats had no impact on the taurine content in muscles.",
        "To clarify our observations of conflicting taurine effects in the dystrophic mouse and rat models, we also tested the impact of taurine treatment in dystrophic dmdpc2/pc2 zebrafish. Similarly, dmdpc2/pc2 zebrafish exhibited significantly higher taurine levels compared with WT controls. In addition, taurine treatment from 2 to 6 days post-fertilisation (dpf) increased taurine content in WT control fish but did not further increase taurine levels in dmdpc2/pc2 zebrafish.",
        "Since the ability of taurine to protect dystrophic muscle from damage is potentially dependent on intrinsic taurine levels, we felt it pertinent to establish the levels of taurine in DMD patients. Archived human plasma samples showed that plasma taurine levels were significantly lower in non-ambulant DMD boys (compared with healthy controls), in accordance with the data for dystrophic mdx mice, but in marked contrast with DMDmdx rats and dystrophic zebrafish.",
        "All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Australia (Maquarie Park, NSW, Australia) unless specified.",
        "Rat experiments were carried out in Nantes, France on dystrophic DMDmdx rats [31,38] and normal control littermate wildtype (WT) (Sprague–Dawley) male rats. All animal experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines of the French National Research Council for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Permit Number: APAFIS#10792–2017061316021120). Rats were maintained at the Institut de Recherche en Santé 2—Nantes University on a 12-h light/dark cycle, under standard conditions, with free access to food and drinking water. From 4 weeks of age, rats were randomly assigned to the following groups—untreated wildtype (WT) control rats, untreated DMDmdx rats, taurine-treated DMDmdx rats (2 g/kg/day) and taurine-treated DMDmdx rats (5 g/kg/day). These doses were chosen based on doses used in previous studies in our laboratory and others [20,22,23]. Taurine was administered via the drinking water for 8 weeks; every two days taurine concentration was adjusted in water in order to correspond to each individual’s approximate daily water intake. During the experiment, body weights and taurine consumption were measured.",
        "At 12 weeks of age at the end of the experiment (after 8 weeks of treatment), forelimb grip strength and locomotor and behavioural activity of all rats were measured. To measure grip strength, rats were placed with their forepaws on a T-bar, and gently pulled backwards until they released their grip. A grip meter (Bio-GT3, Bioseb, Vitrolles, France) attached to a force transducer measured the generated peak force. For each session, 5 trials were performed sequentially, and the results are expressed as the mean of 3 median values in grams (g) and normalised by the body weight (g/g). Locomotion and behavior analysis was performed in an open-field arena (dimensions of 100 cm × 100 cm × 40 cm) for 5 min (OF-3C, Bioseb, Vitrolles, France). This open-field system was composed of a 3D sensor-based technology accurately capable of rearing detection by direct height measurements. This 3D camera was connected to software analyzing the spontaneous locomotion of the rat placed in a novel environment. Several parameters were analyzed: distance travelled (cm), activity time (s), and number of rearings.",
        "Thirty minutes to 6 h after a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine for analgesia (Buprecare, 0.03 mg/mL, Axience, Pantin, France), rats were anesthetised with etomidate (Hypnomidate 2 mg/mL, Maphar, Casablanca, Morocco) and ketamine (Imalgene, 100 mg/mL, Merial, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany). Rats were sacrificed by blood sampling from the renal vein. Blood was taken for hematology analysis (to quantify blood neutrophils and other blood parameters), and the remainder of the blood was centrifuged to prepare plasma samples that were stored frozen at −80 °C. Both biceps femoris muscles were taken, and either frozen in pre-cooled isopentane for histological analysis, or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical analysis. These frozen samples of plasma and muscle were flown to Perth, Australia for analyses. The tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, and soleus muscles were also removed, and weight recorded.",
        "Zebrafish experiments were carried out in Melbourne, Australia. Fish maintenance and handling were performed as per the standard operating procedures approved by the Monash Animal Research Precinct Ethics Committee 3, Monash University and maintained according to standard protocols [43]. The dmdPC2/+ zebrafish parental strains [35] were in-crossed and their progeny were treated with either 1 mM Taurine (as per [44]) or water (vehicle-treated control) dissolved in embryo media (E3) or left in E3 without treatment, from 2 to 6 days post fertilisation (dpf). For locomotion assays, fish were plated in a randomised manner in 24-well plates at 5 dpf and their movement was recorded at 6 dpf [45]. Following this, fish were genotyped using a KASP genotyping protocol (LGC Genomics-UK), and the distance travelled was determined using Ethovision XT, (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands). At 6 dpf heads were removed and used for KASP genotyping, the tails were then snap frozen and flown to Perth, Australia. For the analysis, tails were pooled by genotype.",
        "Archival human plasma samples from DMD patients and normal boys were obtained from the Newcastle University Biobank (UK). Samples from two groups of DMD patients were used, 10 ambulant young boys (aged 2–8) and 7 non-ambulant (aged 16–20). Control samples were taken from normal healthy boys of various ages and used as age matched controls (aged 2–8 and 18–20, respectively). Frozen samples were flown to Perth, Australia for analysis.",
        "Taurine was measured in the plasma and muscle using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as previously described [20]. In brief, plasma samples were precipitated by the addition of 20 times by weight of 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Frozen muscle was crushed using a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen and homogenised in 100 times 5% TCA. Zebrafish tails were collected from four independent replicates (12 tails for each experimental condition). The sample for each replicate was split into two, to allow technical replication, and the mean of the technical replicates was used in the subsequent analysis. Samples were homogenised in 200 µL 5% TCA. After centrifugation, supernatants were removed and stored at −80 °C before analysis. Analytes were separated using HPLC with fluorescent detection, with pre-column derivatisation with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) and 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME). OPA reacts rapidly with amino acids and sulfhydryl groups to yield intensely fluorescent derivatives, and 2ME, a reducing agent, prevents the OPA reagent from oxidising. An internal standard, O-phospho-DL-serine, dissolved in 5% TCA was added. Sodium borate was used to adjust the pH to 9. Samples were placed in an autosampler, which was maintained at 4 °C. Samples were mixed on a sample loop with a derivatising solution containing 20 mM OPA and 60 mM 2ME in 100 mM sodium borate, pH 10, for 30 s before injection onto the column. Separation was achieved with a C18 column (4 µm, 4.6 × 100 mm, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system. Mobile phase A consisted of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, methanol, and tetrahydrofuran (94:3:3). Mobile phase B consisted of 90% methanol, with a gradient increase in B from 0 to 100%. Fluorescence was set at 360 nm and 455 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The protein content of the muscle and zebrafish samples were quantified by solubilising the pellet in 0.5M sodium hydroxide, before incubation at 80 °C for 15 min. Once fully dissolved, protein concentrations of supernatants were quantified using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Australia, South Granville, NSW, Australia).",
        "Plasma CK reflects the leak of CK from muscles into the blood and is a classic systemic measure of damage and necrosis of dystrophic muscles [46]. CK levels were measured using a CK-NAC kit (Randox Laboratories, Crumlin, United Kingdom) and analysed kinetically using a BioTek Powerwave XS Spectrophotometer (Currumbin, QLD, Australia) using the KC4 (V34) program.",
        "Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme secreted by neutrophils and MPO activity is a useful biomarker of neutrophils in tissues [47,48]. The enzyme MPO catalyses the production of HOCl from hydrogen peroxide and chloride [49] and HOCl acid reacts with 2-[6-(4-aminophenoxy)-3-oxo-3H-xanthen-9-yl]benzoic acid (APF) to form the highly fluorescent compound fluorescein, that is measured in this method, as previously described [33]. Briefly, frozen biceps femoris muscles from rats were crushed under liquid nitrogen and homogenised in 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Samples were centrifuged and supernatants diluted in PBS. Human MPO was used as the standard for the assay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Aliquots of each experimental sample or MPO standard were pipetted into a 384 well plate, before the addition of APF working solution (20 µM APF and 20 µM hydrogen peroxide in PBS) was added. The plate was incubated at room temperature (protected from light) for 30 min, with the fluorescence being measured every minute using excitation at 485 nm and emission at 515–530 nm. The rate of change of fluorescence for each sample was compared to that of the standards and results were expressed per mg of protein, quantified using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Australia, South Granville, NSW, Australia).",
        "Protein thiols are susceptible to oxidation by oxidants, leading to the reversible formation of disulphide bonds, and thus the percentage of thiols undergoing oxidation is a sensitive biomarker of oxidative stress [50]. Reduced and oxidised protein thiols were measured in rat biceps femoris muscles using the 2-tag technique as described previously [20]. In brief, frozen muscle was crushed under liquid nitrogen, before protein was extracted with 20% TCA/acetone. Protein was solubilised in an SDS buffer and protein thiols were labelled with the fluorescent dye BODIPY FL-N-(2-aminoethyl) maleimide (FLM, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Following the removal of the unbound dye using cysteine, protein was re-solubilised in SDS buffer and oxidised thiols were reduced with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) before the subsequent unlabelled reduced thiols were labelled with a second fluorescent dye Texas Red C2-maleimide (Texas red, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). The sample was washed in 100% TCA, followed by acetone, and resuspended in SDS buffer. Samples were read using a fluorescent plate reader (Fluostar Optima, BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) with wavelengths set at excitation 485 nm, emission 520 nm for FLM, and excitation 595 nm, emission 610 nm for Texas red. A standard curve for each dye was generated using ovalbumin and the results were expressed per mg of protein, quantified using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Australia, South Granville, NSW, Australia).",
        "For rat and human experiments, data were analysed using GraphPad Prism software (Boston, MA, USA). One-way ANOVAs and post-hoc (Tukey) testing to correct for multiple comparisons were used. For zebrafish assays, data were analyzed using a linear model in IBM SPSS Statistics (version 28) with replicate, genotype, and treatment as factors for the taurine analysis and replicate, genotype, treatment, and tracking system as factors for the swimming analysis. In both cases planned tests were conducted to explore genotype–treatment interactions. All results are presented as mean ± SEM with a significance level set at p < 0.05.",
        "At 12 weeks of age, the DMDmdx rat muscle produced 30% less forelimb grip force than WT rats, and neither dose of taurine had any effect on grip strength (Figure 1A).",
        "DMDmdx rats had 11-fold more plasma CK than WT, with no effect of either dose of taurine (Figure 1B). Other measures of phenotype and dystropathology for WT and untreated and treated DMDmdx rats are summarised in Table 1. Differences for untreated DMDmdx rats (compared with WT) included significantly higher (1.1-fold) muscle weight for tibialis anterior muscle, and for plasma, (1.7-fold) higher levels of platelets, a higher (~3-fold) percentage of neutrophils, fewer (30%) lymphocytes, and a small increase in haematocrit. Neither dose of taurine had any effect on any parameter, except that both doses decreased the haematocrit back to WT levels.",
        "Untreated DMDmdx rats had 3.5-fold more plasma taurine than WT control rats (Figure 2A). The 2 g/kg/day and 5 g/kg/day doses of taurine increased DMDmdx plasma taurine 4 and 7-fold, respectively (Figure 2A).",
        "Skeletal muscles (biceps femoris) of untreated DMDmdx rats had 2-fold more taurine, compared with WT (Figure 2B) with no effect of either dose of taurine (Figure 2B).",
        "DMDmdx rats had 3.3-fold higher plasma neutrophils (%) than WT (Table 1, Figure 3A) and neither dose of taurine had any effect on plasma neutrophil levels (Figure 3A). Muscles (biceps femoris) of untreated DMDmdx rats also had 2-fold more MPO than WT (Figure 3B) and the 2 g/kg/day dose of taurine decreased DMDmdx muscle MPO by 80% (Figure 3B): in contrast the higher 5 g/kg/day taurine dose had no effect (Figure 3B). Protein thiol oxidation was 1.7-fold higher in muscles of DMDmdx rats compared with WT (Figure 3C) and neither dose of taurine had any effect on muscle protein thiol oxidation (Figure 3C).",
        "We used locomotion assays on zebrafish at 6 dpf to determine if taurine treatment improved muscle function. Dystrophin-deficient dmdpc2/pc2 zebrafish travelled a distance of 25% and 24% less than WT dmd+/+ and dmd+/pc2 fish, respectively (p < 0.01) (Figure 4). Taurine treatment had no significant effect on the swimming performance of any genotype (Figure 4).",
        "Zebrafish tails were used to determine taurine levels since they are comprised mostly of skeletal muscle. Dystrophin-deficient dmdpc2/pc2 zebrafish tails had 1.7- and 1.5-fold higher taurine than WT dmd+/+ and heterozygote dmd+/pc2, respectively (Figure 5). While taurine treatment had no effect on taurine levels of dystrophin-deficient fish tails, taurine treatment significantly increased the taurine content in dmd+/+ (p < 0.001) and dmd+/pc2 (p = 0.014) tails (Figure 5).",
        "There was no difference in plasma taurine content between young healthy controls (2–8 years) and ambulant DMD boys aged 2–8 (Figure 6). However, the older non-ambulant DMD patients (aged 16–20 years) had 30% lower plasma taurine than age-matched controls (aged 18–20 years). Non-ambulant DMD patients had 3-fold more plasma taurine than ambulant DMD boys (Figure 6). Also of note, plasma taurine in older controls in their late teens was 6-fold higher than for the younger controls aged under 10 years (Figure 6).",
        "We hypothesised that taurine treatment would reduce the severity of dystropathology in the DMDmdx rat and dmd zebrafish, two models for DMD that are considered more severe compared to the widely used mdx mouse. Taurine is considered important for the function of skeletal muscle, where it modulates ion channel function, membrane stability, and calcium homeostasis, as well as having anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [51,52,53,54,55,56]. However, we showed that taurine administration to DMDmdx rats had very little effect on the indices of dystropathology. Likewise, taurine administration to young dystrophic dmd zebrafish had no effect on muscle function (distance travelled). The surprising results for these two animal models contrast with our previous studies in young mdx mice (aged up to 6 weeks) where taurine had many benefits, with improved grip strength and decreased muscle necrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and plasma CK content [19,20,21]. Various benefits of taurine administration in mdx mice have also been widely reported by other groups for mice aged up to 12 months [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,57].",
        "Interestingly, the endogenous plasma and muscle taurine levels in young adult DMDmdx rats aged 12 weeks were unexpectedly higher relative to WT rats and, while both doses of taurine increased levels of plasma taurine in DMDmdx rats, neither dose had an effect on muscle taurine levels. Likewise, taurine levels in dystrophic dmdpc2/pc2 zebrafish tails (mainly composed of skeletal muscle) were higher than WT dmd+/+ fish, and taurine treatment did not increase the taurine content of dystrophic dmdpc2/pc2 tails (but did in WT dmd+/+ fish). Taurine content of mdx muscle has been measured across the lifespan of mdx mice (summarised in Table 2). In most studies, muscle taurine levels in mdx muscle were either lower than, or equivalent, to WT (C57), and taurine was effective at reducing dystropathology. In one study (at 10 weeks), muscle taurine levels were observed to be higher than WT, and at this age, taurine was not effective at reducing dystropathology [28].",
        "In these studies where taurine treatment was effective in reducing the severity of dystropathology, it was also observed that taurine treatment increased the taurine content of mdx muscle (summarised in Table 2). These previous results, combined with the new data in this current study, suggest that taurine is only efficacious in models where treatment improves the muscle content of taurine. This increase after exogenous taurine treatment was not observed in dystrophic models where intrinsic endogenous muscle taurine levels were high (i.e., DMDmdx rats, dmdpc2/pc2 zebrafish, and 10 week mdx mice [28]). Interestingly, in older mice (from 12 weeks) taurine in mdx plasma was higher than WT (summarised in Table 2). However, taurine treatment was still effective in older mdx mice, suggesting that the muscle content of taurine, rather than plasma content, is the important factor in determining efficacy. While the exact cause of perturbations in taurine levels in these models is not understood, we have previously explored taurine metabolism and transport in mdx mice [30]. We showed that taurine homeostasis, including synthesis in the liver, excretion in the kidney, and transport into the muscle was affected by dystrophy (and age). Future studies into taurine homeostasis in DMDmdx rats, dmdpc2/pc2 zebrafish, and even DMD patients would greatly help our understanding of the great variability in endogenous taurine levels in all of these species.",
        "Since these combined results suggest that the ability of taurine to protect dystrophic muscle from damage is potentially determined by endogenous taurine levels, we thought it pertinent to measure taurine levels in DMD boys. As DMD muscle biopsies were not available, we measured taurine in archival plasma samples from DMD patients. While there was no significant difference in plasma taurine levels between young ambulant DMD (2–8 years) and normal boys of the same age, the older non-ambulant DMD boys with severe loss of muscle mass (16–20 years) had lower plasma taurine compared with normal boys. The observation that the normal teenage boys had markedly more taurine than younger normal boys, accords with previous reports that attributed this difference to the increased requirements of taurine during periods of peak growth [58]. Interestingly, in normal mice we observed that taurine levels were 5 and 10 times higher in the liver and plasma, respectively, in juvenile 18-day WT mice (during a period of peak growth just prior to weaning) compared with older WT mice [30]. These data support the need for high levels of taurine during normal growth. In mdx mice, this is also the age where we observed the biggest deficiencies in liver and plasma taurine in juvenile animals; this is also the time of peak myonecrosis [30] and the high metabolic demands of growth [59]. Benefits of taurine administration were pronounced in young mdx mice; however, this is in marked contrast with the situation in young zebrafish, presumably due to species differences. To further understand taurine metabolism in dystrophy, and to help assess the potential of taurine as a beneficial therapy for DMD, it would be informative to measure taurine levels in DMD muscles at different ages: unfortunately, this is difficult in DMD patients as it requires invasive muscle biopsies.",
        "Finally, since the DMDmdx rat is a relatively new model, we thought it pertinent to discuss the phenotypical observations of the model from this current study (Table 1). Previous research has suggested that the model has a severe progressive phenotype compared with mdx mice [38] and our new data for DMDmdx rats show that at 12 weeks of age (young adult) dystropathology was evident as reduced grip strength and increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and plasma CK content compared with normal WT rats (although many other parameters measured were not affected). Studies of dystrophic sciatic nerves in DMDmdx rats (aged 8 months) suggest that there is more pronounced ongoing myonecrosis, compared with mdx mice [41]. A level of sustained myonecrosis was also reported for another dystrophic rat model with no significant difference in the extent of muscle degeneration between week 4 and week 13; these authors also concluded that the pathological progression is more pronounced in dystrophic rats compared with classic mdx mice [60]. It would be useful to have a more detailed description of the extent of myonecrosis, regeneration, and fibrosis in a range of skeletal muscles (e.g., various limb muscles, diaphragm, tongue) across the lifespan for dystrophic DMDmdx rats to compare with the wealth of information published for mdx mice.",
        "In conclusion, taurine administration was not an effective treatment in young dystrophic DMDmdx rats analysed at 12 weeks of age, nor in young dmdpc2/pc2 zebrafish at 6 dpf. We hypothesise that this is due to the intrinsic high levels of taurine we observed in both models (compared to WT), and the resultant inability to therapeutically increase muscle taurine levels. We also showed that plasma taurine levels varied between young and older DMD patients. Limitations of this study include the specific ages of animals used, since pathology of dystrophic animals varies greatly across lifespan. Additionally, to understand the regulation in taurine levels in these different models, future studies could investigate taurine metabolism and transport, as both have been shown to be dysregulated in the mdx mouse [30]. Therefore, more research is required to better understand the potential of taurine to be used as a therapy for DMD boys.",

To examine the effects of specific GDP on the remesothelialization process, the impact of conventional and low GDP peritoneal dialysis solutions, D-glucose, and individual GDP in a scratch-wounding model was assessed. METHODS: Scratch (0.5 to 0.6 mm)-wounded human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC) were treated, at pH 7.4, with either (1) control medium (M199), (2) laboratory-prepared heat or filter-sterilized solutions, (3) 10% to 80% vol/vol solution of Gambrosol or Gambrosol-trio (1.5% and 4.0% glucose), (4) D-glucose (5 to 80 mmol/L), or (5) individual or combined GDP [acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), 5-hydroxy methylfufural (5-HMF), or 3,4-di-deoxyglucosone-3-ene (3,4-DGE)]. Wound closure was recorded by time-lapse photomicroscopy. RESULTS: In untreated HPMC, the rate of wound closure was linear and the process was complete by 18.4 +/- 3.6 hours (N = 16). In wounded HPMC exposed to dilutions of heat-sterilized but not filtered laboratory solutions (1.5% or 4.0% glucose, pH 7.4), remesothelialization was significantly retarded (P = 0.04 and P = 0.009 vs. M199, respectively). In Gambrosol, remesothelialization was significantly retarded in both 1.5% and 4.0% solutions. In contrast in Gambrosol-trio-treated HPMC, this rate was not significantly reduced in either 1.5% or 4.0% glucose peritoneal dialysis fluids. Remesothelialization was dose-dependently retarded in HPMC exposed to 3,4-DGE (>10 microl/L), formaldehyde (>5 micromol/L) but not by exposure to the other GDP tested even at 5 times the concentration present in low glucose solutions. The rate of remesothelialization was not significantly altered by exposure to D-glucose concentrations up to 80 mmol/L. CONCLUSION: These data identify that the formaldehyde and 3,4-DGE present in heat-sterilized peritoneal dialysis solutions are important in reducing mesothelial cell regeneration. Specifically targeting their removal may have major benefits in preserving the mesothelium during long-term peritoneal dialysis. Kingdom.",

        "Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a widely used method for renal replacement therapy, similar to hemodialysis and renal transplantation. It involves using the peritoneal membrane as a dialysis membrane to treat end-stage renal disease (ERSD) (1–3). In this procedure, the peritoneal membrane cavity serves as a medium for the transfer of waste products and solutes between the body and the peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDFs). A permanent catheter is inserted to introduce PDFs into the peritoneal cavity. These PDFs contain glucose as an osmotic agent, which facilitates the movement of fluid from the circulation to the peritoneal membrane cavity, eliminating the metabolic waste products and excess water (4). Globally, PD is utilized by over 272,000 patients, accounting for approximately 11% of dialysis patients (5). PD therapy offers a higher quality of life and lower cost for individuals with ESRD compared to hemodialysis, owing to its simplicity of operation, low risk of cross-infectious, and preservation of residual renal function (6–8). Traditionally, the most commonly used PDFs have an acidic pH and rely on high osmotic glucose solutions to facilitate water and solute exchange. However, in recent years, various types of biocompatible PDFs, such as bicarbonate-based, icodextrin-based, amino acid-based solutions, have also become available in the market (9).",
        "Although PD therapy greatly improves the quality of life for individuals with ESRD, it is not without its drawbacks. One notable concern is the occurrence of PD-related peritonitis, which can lead to chronic inflammation and damage to peritoneal cells (10–13). The development of peritonitis in PD can be attributed to both infectious and non-infectious factors (14). In particular, infection-related peritonitis remains the most common cause of technique failure and subsequent transition to hemodialysis in academic settings. The peritoneal membrane often undergoes significant changes in both structure and function during prolonged dialysis, leading to chronic inflammation. These alterations include mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the growth of new blood vessels (neoangiogenesis), the development of fibrosis beneath the mesothelium (sub‐mesothelial fibrosis), and the occurrence of hyalinizing vasculopathy. These factors can cause irreversible damage to the peritoneal tissue, resulting in the failure of ultrafiltration and a decline in the effectiveness of dialysis (15–17). Unfortunately, the chronic sterile inflammation caused by these various factors frequently goes unnoticed or receives limited attention.",
        "The induction of sterile inflammation is a complex pathological process in which resident cells sense pro-inflammatory signals and release extracellular mediators, leading to the recruitment of circulating immune cells that contribute to the initiation and escalation of the inflammatory response. Consequently, the development of sterile inflammation is the result of intricate signaling interactions between stromal resident cells and circulating immune cells, understanding of which has the potential to improve the medical management of this harmful condition. In recent years, there have been some successful attempts to address this issue. This paper focuses on the interactions between immune cells and peritoneal stroma cells in sterile inflammation. Furthermore, potential interventions for sterile inflammation caused by PD are discussed, which could be significantly important in preventing aseptic changes in PD.",
        "The peritoneum is structured into three distinct layers: the mesothelium, the basal lamina, and the submesothelial stroma. The submesothelial stroma provides support to the mesothelial cells and the basal lamina, and is mainly composed of collagen fibers, (myo)fibroblasts, adipocytes, as well as lymphatic and blood vessels (18). In the context of PD, the prolonged exposure of the mesothelium to bioincompatible PDFs and their breakdown products triggers an inflammatory response in mesothelial cell. Consequently, this response stimulates the production of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (19–23). These factors have the potential to initiate damage to the peritoneum (24). The occurrence of cellular stress and tissue damage triggers the production of ECM degradation products and the release of endogenous cellular constituents, which are referred to as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (25). These DAMPs activate pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic signaling pathways. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), specifically TLR2 and TLR4, as well as the receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGEs), plays a crucial role in recognizing and responding to DAMPs (25–28). They recognize a wide range of DAMPs that are released during tissue injury, including hyaluronan and fibronectin resulting from matrix degradation, as well as heat shock proteins and high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) released due to cellular stress (25, 29–33). Activation of TLRs triggers the production of inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8 and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) (34, 35). However, the use of soluble TLR2 (a TLR inhibitor) has been found to reduce the development of sterile peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis (28, 36). Additionally, when mesothelial cells are exposed to PDFs, they release HMGB1 from the nucleus. This HMGB1 acts on the mesothelial cells in an autocrine manner, stimulating the expression of IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways (36–38). Importantly, elevated levels of HMGB1 in the serum have been associated with microinflammatory conditions in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Inhibition of HMGB1 has shown a protective effect on peritoneal function in peritonitis models (39, 40).",
        "Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the inflammatory response of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) derived from PDFs (41). A key function of mitochondria is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are involved in oxidative stress (42). Recent research has shown that mitochondria also release DAMPs, which play a significant role in inflammatory and immune responses (43). In addition, impaired mitochondria release DAMPs, such as mitochondrial ROS and mitochondrial DNA, which are recognized by the immune system and trigger an immune response (44). This response can further damage mitochondrial, leading to a cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of inflammation. Specifically, mitochondrial DNA has been shown to activate of TLRs, leading to an inflammatory response (45). Additionally, mitochondrial DNA can activate the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, resulting in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 (46–49). High glucose levels in PDFs also contribute to mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in HPMCs (50, 51). Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction in HPMCs is implicated in T cells differentiation, further exacerbating the inflammatory response (52). The inhibition of ROS could have a significant impact on the activation of NLRP3, production of ROS, and expression of IL-1β (53). Furthermore, the application of resveratrol has been shown to induce mitophagy/autophagy through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, resulting in a decrease in the inflammatory response by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome (49). Additionally, recent research has shown that paricalcitol can alleviate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HPMCs triggered by TGF-β1 through the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome and oxidative stress (54).",
        "Numerous studies have provided evidence that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway plays a crucial role in the PD-related sterile inflammation. In patients undergoing CAPD, the presence of various compounds and glycated proteins strongly activates the NF-κB pathway in HPMCs, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, as well as the activation of cyclooxygenase-2 (55). In rat models, NF-κB signaling pathways are also activated by high glucose and hypertonic PDFs through a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent mechanism. This activation results in an increased synthesis of MCP-1 (22, 56). Additionally, the EMT process observed in PD patients, which is a common disorder is also influenced by the activation of NF-κB (20, 23). A study has shown that p38 plays a role in maintaining the expression of E-cadherin by suppressing TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) NF-κB pathway, thereby inhibiting EMT in primary HPMCs (57). The activation of p38 may also lead to an increase in IL-8 transcription through NF-κB and post-transcriptional molecular mechanisms (58–60). Another study has indicated that the process of EMT is regulated by the ERK/NF-κB/Snail1 pathway in primary mesothelial cells from PD patients (20). However, the administration of parthenolide, a NF-κB inhibitor, has been shown to reduce inflammation and peritoneal fibrosis (PF) through the NF-κB/TGF-β/Smad pathway, thereby reducing the level of IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 (61).",
        "Recent researches have demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ), a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates glucose and lipid homeostasis, possesses anti-inflammatory properties (62, 63). Exposure of the peritoneum to PDFs leads to EMT of HPMCs, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and an inflammatory response. However, administration of the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone in mice has been found to alleviate these changes (64). The PPARβ/δ agonist GW501516 has also been found to have a mitigating effect on peritonitis in rat models of PF through the inhibition of the TAK1–NF-κB pathway (65). Furthermore, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 and its derived prostaglandin E2 also play a crucial role in PF (66). Recent researches have shown that the treatment of ONO-AE3–208, a prostaglandin E2 receptor 4, can suppress both the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by high glucose in rat peritoneal mesothelial cells. This is achieved by regulating NF-κB signaling (36, 67, 68). Additionally, the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway has been found to contribute to the inflammatory response in the peritoneum of patients undergoing PD (69). Furthermore, both the p38 MAPK pathway and the PKC signaling have been shown to be activated in high glucose-induced inflammation in HPMCs (70, 71). It has also been observed that high glucose treatment stimulates IL-6 synthesis in Met-5A cell, and IL-6 subsequently stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis, partially dependent on the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway (\nFigure 1\n) (72).",
        "The role of peritoneal mesothelial cells in sterile inflammation. DAMPs accumulate during chronic exposure to bioincompatible PDFs. These DAMPs subsequently activate pro-inflammatory and profibrotic responses by activating TLRs and RAGE. In the condition of PDFs, the mesothelial cells secrets HMGB1, a type of DAMPs, which in turn enhances the inflammatory response. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction induced by PDFs leads to the activation of NLRP3, triggering the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
        "Mesothelial cells possess the remarkable ability to synthesize and release a variety of complement factors, specifically C4, C3, and C5-C9 (73, 74). These complement proteins play a crucial role in the immune response. Additionally, other tissue-resident cells, including immune cells, may also contribute to the production of complement proteins within the peritoneal cavity. Studies have confirmed the presence of complement system molecules, such as C3-C9 and factor D, in the fluid that is drained during PD (75, 76). In fact, proteomic analysis has identified up to 18 different complement proteins, including C3, C4, C9, factors D, B, H, and I, in the PDFs (77–81). It is noteworthy that the complement system can be activated within the peritoneal cavity due to the production and expression of various effectors (such as C3, C4, C5, and C6–C9) and their regulators (such as membrane cofactor protein, CD55, and CD59) by mesothelial cells derived from healthy individuals and patients with kidney disease who are undergoing PD (73, 74, 82, 83). Activation of the complement system in PD patients is believed to occur due to exposure to PDFs, particularly those containing high levels of glucose and glucose degradation products. This exposure to high glucose PDFs can trigger an excessive activation of the complement system, leading to local inflammation, cellular damage, and ultimately causing structural alterations in the peritoneal membrane. These alterations may include vascular proliferation, vasculopathy and PF (84, 85).",
        "Glucose and its degradation products found in PDFs have been identified as triggers of EMT in mesothelial cells. This transition causes the cells to transform into fibroblast-like cells with increased migratory, invasive, and fibrogenic properties (37, 86). As a result, mesothelial cells undergoing EMT secrete large amounts of TGF-β and VEGF. The local production of VEGF by transitioning mesothelial cells appears to play a pivotal role in the mechanisms involved in peritoneal angiogenesis and vascular permeability. This process may contribute to the inflammation within the peritoneum (87, 88).",
        "The EMT of mesothelial cells is a critical source of peritoneal fibroblasts, which have been implicated in the aseptic inflammation induced by PD. Similar to mesothelium cells, peritoneal fibroblasts, have the ability to synthesize various chemokines. One example is the release of chemokines MCP-1/CCL2 and IL-8/CXCL8, which are chemokines involved in recruiting immune cells, by peritoneal fibroblasts. This process is mediated by the NF-κB family, a group of transcription factors that play a role in inflammation (88). Additionally, peritoneal fibroblasts can produce cytokines of CXCL1 and CXCL8, which target neutrophils. The production of these cytokines is primarily induced by IL-1β (89). Furthermore, peritoneal fibroblasts have the capability to produce CCL5, a potent chemoattractant for mononuclear leukocytes. The production of CCL5 is intricately regulated by IFN-γ, a cytokine with immunomodulatory functions. Additionally, the treatment of peritoneal fibroblasts with IFN-γ can induce the production of CCL5 in response to CD40 ligand, a protein involved in immune cell activation (90).",
        "Furthermore, peritoneal fibroblasts have been found to produce chemokines in response to exposure to high levels of glucose. In vitro studies have demonstrated that stimulation of peritoneal fibroblasts with high glucose PDFs leads to increased expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand mRNA and nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) (91). Previous research has indicated that NFAT5 modulates the activity of NF-κB in response to osmotic stress (92). The increased expression of NFAT5 in human peritoneal fibroblasts is associated with NF-κB activation in patients undergoing PD, potentially leading to the recruitment of macrophages.",
        "The presence of PD appears to have a notable proinflammatory effect on the endothelium (93). In healthy individuals, the expression of IL-17, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is minimal in the peritoneum, but it is highly expressed in peritoneal biopsies of long-term PD patients (94). This increase in IL-17 contributes to angiogenic stimulation and direct damage to the peritoneum in PD patients. IL-17 up-regulates the expression of VEGF, leading to enhanced angiogenesis. It also promotes the production of CXC chemokines such as CXCL1 and CXCL8, which further contribute to inflammation.",
        "Additionally, IL-17 stimulates the release of IL-6, another pro-inflammatory cytokine, from various sources including HPMCs, endothelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes (95, 96). IL-6 upon, specific binding to its receptor, further enhances the production of angiogenic molecules like VEGF and adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (97–99). With the stimulation of PDFs, the above inflammation factors were significantly higher in the endothelial cells via activating both p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathway. This observation was consistent with the findings in PD patients, where increased levels of these inflammatory factors were observed (93). The stimulation of endothelial cells by these inflammatory factors, such as VEGF, resulted in microvascular alterations characterized by increased vascular permeability, microcirculation density, and transendothelial migration of infiltrating cells. These alterations can contribute to endothelial cells proliferation, inflammation, and injury, ultimately leading to peritoneal inflammation, fibrosis, and reduced efficacy of PD (\nFigure 2\n) (100–102).",
        "Endothelial cells alterations in PD. Both inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17 secreted from HPMCs and immune cells contribute to increase vascular permeability, microcirculation density, and transendothelial migration of infiltrating cells via up-regulating the expression of VEGF.",
        "Previous studies have shown that cultured HPMCs produce VEGF-A and VEGF-C in response to glucose degradation products or cytokines (103, 104). However, it has been observed that targeting of VEGF-A by miR-15a-5p can suppress inflammation and fibrosis in HPMCs induced by PD (104). In addition, the use of biocompatible PDFs has been found to result in fewer adverse reactions in endothelial dysfunction compared to conventional PDFs in PD patients (105).",
        "In recent years, the potential impact of adipocytes in PD has been overlooked. There is a noticeable increase in body mass among PD patients, with visceral fat being the main contributor (106, 107). Long-term PD patients also display elevated levels of adipokines in their plasma (108). Ultrastructural investigations have shown that dialysate can penetrate adipose tissue in the presence of an injured mesothelial monolayer (109). Adipocytes have various functions, including autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine activities. They release a range of adipokines and cytokines, such as leptin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, IL-6, TNF-a, TGF-β, VEGF, and others (110). On one hand, adipokines such as leptin and resistin have pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic effects. Leptin, a hormone secreted in large amounts by adipocytes, can phosphorylate VEGFR2 and activate the p38 MAPK/Akt/COX-2 signaling pathway, thereby promoting angiogenesis (111). In addition, hyperleptinemia induced by PD also stimulates macrophages and monocytes to secret IL-6 and TNF-α (112). Conversely, certain adipokines, such as adiponectin and omentin, have anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties. However, their expression is suppressed in the peritoneum (113). Adiponectin plays a crucial role in inhibiting the production of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells, thereby preventing the attachment of monocytes (114). Moreover, it reduces the activation of NF-κB, which is induced by TNF-α. However, there is a negative feedback loop between TNF-α and adiponectin, as TNF-α downregulates the production of adiponectin, creating a vicious cycle that leads to lower adiponectin release (115). Furthermore, adipose-derived cytokine, promotes the propagation of inflammation by stimulation macrophage infiltration into the interstitial spaces within adipose tissue (116). Prolonged dialysis has been found to result in an accumulation of adipocytes and infiltrated macrophages within the body, which in turn secrete various adipokines and cytokines that contribute to inflammation and tissue damage (117–119). Interestingly, the omentum, a fatty tissue layer within the abdomen, contains a significant number of progenitor cells (120). The stromal vascular fraction derived from adipose tissues also contains pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells that have the ability to regenerate damaged tissue (121). This discovery offers a promising approach for preserving the functionality of the peritoneal membrane (\nFigure 3\n).",
        "Adipocytes in inflammation and angiogenesis during PD. Adipocytes would be stimulated in the condition of injury mesothelial. The activated adipocytes subsequently release pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic cytokines (e.g., leptin and resistin) and suppress anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., adiponectin and omentin). Additionally, MCP-1 derived from adipose promotes macrophages infiltration to fat tissue.",
        "The activation of macrophages plays a crucial role in the advancement of kidney diseases and the ineffectiveness of treatment for PD (\nFigure 4\n). Monocytes and macrophages constitute a significant proportion (50%-90%) of the infiltrated leukocytes in peritoneum (122, 123). Generally, macrophages can be divided into two categories: tissue resident macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages (124). While monocyte-derived macrophages have been shown to contribute to the progression of inflammation and fibrosis, tissue resident macrophages have a protective role. Surprisingly, researchers have discovered that peritoneal resident macrophages are gradually losing their homeostatic properties and anti-inflammatory properties, instead exhibiting a heightened inflammatory response (125). Furthermore, it has been observed that M2 macrophages are elevated in both the effluents and peritoneal membrane biopsies of PD patients (126, 127). In mice induced with chlorhexidine gluconate and PDFs, there is also an increase in the infiltration of T cells and macrophages (128, 129). Additionally, the presence of high glucose PDFs leads to a significant increase in inflammation and almost complete depletion of tissue resident cells (125). The inflammatory macrophages that infiltrate the affected area produce inflammatory cytokines and collaborate with adipocytes, resulting in a substantial escalation of the inflammatory cascade (116).",
        "The effect of macrophages in peritoneal damage by PDFs. Prolonged dialysis further leads to an increased capacity of recruited macrophages and a depletion of tissue resident cells. Prolonged exposure to high glucose PDFs and the cytokines leads to the differentiation and activation of macrophages, which onsets inflammatory response.",
        "Among these receptors, TLR4 has been extensively studied in macrophage polarization and peritonitis (59, 130). The injury and necrosis of mesothelial cells induced by high glucose exacerbate the accumulation of extracellular TLR4 and HMGB1, resulting in the recruitment of a significant number of macrophages to the abdominal cavity (131, 132). Additionally, HMGB1 has the ability to activate TLRs, initiating innate immunity and subsequently increasing the expression of MCP-1 and the activation of macrophages (133). Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and glucose degradation products can stimulate peritoneal macrophages, leading to the secretion of cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, in HPMCs (134). The NLRP3 inflammasome and its downstream pathway enhances the activation of caspase-1 and the maturation of IL-1β specifically in macrophages, contributing to the progression of inflammation (135, 136). Prolonged exposure to high glucose PDFs and the cytokines can induce macrophage polarizations, which contributes to an inflammatory response and PF (137–139). M1 macrophages release inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, while M2 macrophages secrete anti-inflammatory substances like IL-10 and arginase-1 (140, 141). Previous research has shown that high glucose induces peritoneal injury via the PKC-β pathway and promotes M1 macrophage polarization in mouse models (142). It has been observed that PD induces a shift in adipose tissue macrophages from M2 to M1, promoting a pro-inflammatory state (116). Co-culturing HMrSV5 with M1 macrophages resulted in a loss of the typical epithelial cell morphology, indicating that HMrSV5 undergoes EMT through TLR4 receptors (143). Additionally, previous studies have proposed a role of M2 macrophages in peritoneal inflammation and PF (126, 144). It is worth mentioning that exposure to PDFs has been shown to induce polarization of M2 macrophages and the subsequent inflammatory response, which may be associated with the transmission of exosomes (145).",
        "In previous research, it has been demonstrated that the administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus casei Zhang effectively corrects gut dysbiosis, leading to an improvement in PF. This improvement is achieved through the inhibition of macrophage-related inflammation via the PPAR-γ/NF-κB pathway (122). Moreover, the use of biocompatible PDFs has been found to increase the recruitment of M1 macrophages in uremic mice (146). In the context of dialysis-induced PF, mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to induce the polarization of macrophages into the M2 phenotype through the release of IL-6 (147). Astragalus membranaceus, a traditional Chinese medicine with anti-inflammatory properties, has been found to inhibit the recruitment and activation of monocytes/macrophages via the MCP-1 pathway in rats undergoing PD (148). Moreover, treatment with hepatocyte growth factor has been shown to reduce the infiltration of macrophages in mouse models of PF, while also mitigating the upregulation of proinflammatory and profibrotic genes associated with PF (149).",
        "Lymphocytes can be roughly divided into T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. B lymphocyte cells have been identified as important contributors to innate immunity and autoimmunity. However, there is little evidence suggesting their involvement in PD-related sterile inflammation (150). On the other hand, an increased number of T lymphocytes has been observed in the effluent of patients undergoing PD (151). Thus, targeting the differentiation of T cells may offer potential therapeutic strategies for treating peritoneal damage by regulating immune and inflammatory responses. Notably, there are notable differences in the levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients undergoing PD compared to healthy individuals (152, 153). Regarding CD4+ cells subsets, Th1 cells are characterized by increased production of IFN-γ, while Th2 cells primarily secrete IL-4 (154). Interestingly, patients undergoing CAPD have shown a significant increase in the proportion of Th2 cells (155). This dysregulation of Th1/Th2 balance in PD patients leads to changes in proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in their serum (156–158). Surprisingly, preliminary studies have indicated that PF mice induced by PDFs exhibit an enhanced immune response, characterized by the presence of Th17 and T cells in the peritoneum, rather than Th1 or Th2 cells (159).",
        "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in limiting inflammation, while Th17 cells secrete various proinflammatory cytokines. Tregs are responsible for regulating the expansion of T cells, including Th17 cells, which have been implicated in peritoneal damage and the development of fibrosis (151, 160). A primary study has demonstrated that exposure to PDFs leads to an imbalance of Th17/Treg cells, with an increase in Th17 cells and a decrease in Treg cells, ultimately resulting in peritoneal damage in mouse models (151). Additionally, CD69, a leukocyte membrane glycoprotein, contributes to activation of Th17 cells and the expression of IL-17 in PD mouse models through the JAK3/STAT5 signaling pathway (160, 161). Therapeutic inhibition of TLR2 activity in the peritoneum has been shown to protect against inflammation and PF induced by PDFs, resulting in an increase in the ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells (162). Another study suggests that T lymphocytes stimulates IL-17 expression by releasing calpains to regulate TLR2 (163).",
        "Recent evidence also suggests that the IL-17A-induced inflammatory response may contribute to peritoneal injury in both experimental models induced by PDFs and in patients undergoing PD (94, 146, 160, 164). Studies in mice and human peritoneal biopsies have also demonstrated an overexpression of IL-17 (151). It is possible that endogenous factors in the peritoneum, such as AGEs, might regulate IL-17 levels by promoting pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TGF-β (165, 166). Binding IL-17A to its receptor in mesothelial cells has the ability to trigger proinflammatory responses. Studies using cultured HPMCs have shown that IL-17A can activate the NF-κB pathway and the release of downstream cytokines, such as CXCL1 (167, 168). Additionally, IL-17A has been found to stimulate peritoneal cells, resulting in the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1, which contribute to the persistence of inflammation (48, 169). Resident γδ T cells in peritoneum produce IL-17, which in turn contributes to fibrosis and ultrafiltration failure (94). Conversely, studies have shown that intraperitoneal injections of a neutralizing IL-17A antibody can prevent peritoneal changes and reduced PF in mice exposed to PDFs (94).",
        "Various therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing peritoneal damage by targeting the Th17/Treg axis have been investigated (\nFigure 5\n). In PD patients, treatment with rosiglitazone has been shown to lower levels of IL-17 and IL-23 and increase levels of FoxP3+Treg activity (64). Paricalcitol, the vitamin D activator, also inhibits IL-17 production and slows the progression of PF (170). The dipeptide alanyl-glutamine has also been found to ameliorate PF and attenuate IL-17-dependent pathways during PD (171). Additionally, it has been discovered that the use of conventional PDFs triggers the activation of the Th17 immune response in the peritoneum, while the use of biocompatible PDFs does not (146). Moreover, potential therapeutic options include statins, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, as they have shown the ability to modulate the Th17/IL-17A response in the injured peritoneum (172).",
        "Th17/Treg axis contributes to peritoneal damage induced by PDFs. Prolong exposure to dialysis fluids results in an imbalance of Th17/Treg cells, with an up-regulation of Th17 cells and down-regulation of Treg cells, ultimately leading to peritoneal damage. IL-17A released by activated Th17 cells stimulate peritoneal cells, leading to the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Nevertheless, therapeutic approaches targeting the T17/Treg-axis may be beneficial to reduce peritoneal injury.",
        "Besides, the presence of AGEs has been hypothesized to be responsible for the proliferation of CD8+ lymphocytes (153, 173). It is believed that repeated exposure to the dialysate can lead to the recruitment and transformation of CD8+ naïve T cells into CD8+ effector memory cells (174).",
        "The role and specific mechanism of mast cells in PD remain a topic of controversy. Several studies have reported an elevated presence of mast ocytes in samples obtained from PD patients (175). Additionally, both chronic renal failure rat models and PD rat models have shown a significant increase in mast cell numbers in the peritoneum (4, 176, 177). However, a preliminary investigation observed a decrease in mast cell quantification in peritoneal biopsies of patients (178). The influence of mast cells on inflammatory and fibrotic processes is depends on the timing, intensity, or nature of the damaging stimulus (179, 180). Mast cells that reside in the peritoneum have the potential to modulate the functioning of mesothelial cells through the release of their mediators, primarily histamine. This modulation occurs partly through calcium-dependent pathways and can affect the functionality of the peritoneum in the context of PD (181). In addition, mast cells play a role in the remodeling of omental tissue caused by PDFs, leading to the migration of peritoneal cells and the formation of adhesion (182).",
        "Both hemodialysis and PD patients experience a significant decrease in the population of natural killer cells, which are essential components of the innate immune system (183). This highlights a strong link between ESRD and immune activation, as well as immune deficiency. Notably, another study indicates that the count of natural killer cells does not show any correlation with the duration of CAPD (184).",
        "As previously discussed, TLRs, specifically TLR2 and TLR4, play a crucial role in the development of sterile peritoneal inflammation due to prolonged exposure to PDFs. However, inhibiting TLR2 has been shown to reduce the number of leukocytes in the peritoneum, particularly the infiltrated neutrophils (185). Furthermore, research suggests that the migration of neutrophil during inflammation is influenced by the compatibility of PDFs (101). Despite the documented biocompatibility of currently used catheters, there is extensive evidence of increased eosinophil counts in both peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid following catheter replacement. This response can range from a mild increase in asymptomatic individuals to a severe elevation that can ultimately lead to eosinophilic peritonitis (186–191). Eosinophilic peritonitis is characterized by aseptic inflammation, manifested as cloudy peritoneal dialysis effluent, mild clinical symptoms, negative dialysate culture, and lack of response to antibiotic treatment (191). Tissue invasion, resulting from infection and/or nonspecific stimulation of the PDFs, triggers the release of danger signals that activate eosinophils. This activation initiates the pathogenesis of the innate immune system, aimed at protecting the body but ultimately inducing tissue fibrosis (192).",
        "The cellular and molecular mechanisms mentioned above emphasize the complex nature of the pathophysiological response observed in the peritoneum. The interaction between stromal resident cells and immune cells is mutually influential. Resident cells play an active role in influencing the recruitment, survival, and differentiation of immune cells, On the other hand, immune cells regulate the expression of proinflammatory factors and cytokines, which can cause damage to peritoneal resident cells.",
        "Despite notable progress in PD in recent years, the issue of sterile inflammation remains a significant complication that can result in technique failure and unfavorable clinical outcomes. The repeated exposure to bioincompatible PDFs continues to be the primary cause of sterile inflammation. To overcome this challenge, future research efforts should focus on enhancing the biocompatibility of PDFs to improve peritoneal viability and extend the duration of PD therapy. Currently, no PDFs meet all the ideal solution requirements, which include efficient ultrafiltration, long-term preservation of the peritoneal membrane, and correction of nutritional and metabolic abnormalities.",
        "However, the use of novel PDFs in conjunction has the potential to achieve these objectives. Initial findings from clinical investigations suggest that these biocompatible PDFs can provide comparable effectiveness to conventional regimens while also offering superior preservation of mesothelial cell mass (193). Furthermore, there are evidences to suggest that biocompatible PDFs can induce peritoneal inflammation and angiogenesis in children undergoing PD treatment (194, 195). The activation of peritoneal cells, mediators, and pathways can result in long-lasting functional and structural changes in the peritoneal membrane during long-term PD therapy. However, certain modifications may be reversible through the implementation of peritoneal rest (4, 196). The possibility of remesothelialization or healing depends on allowing the peritoneum to rest. During this resting period, pluripotent cells migrate to the surface and differentiate into fully developed mesothelial cells (197–199). Normal stem cells also play a crucial in tissue regeneration after injury, either by being mobilized from the bone marrow or already present in damaged tissues (147, 200). Furthermore, gene therapy can be used to modify the peritoneal membrane by targeting intervention to control inflammation, fibrosis and angiogenesis. These novel approaches show promising potential in preserving the integrity of the peritoneal membrane (201, 202). However, their clinical efficacy is still to be determined. Additionally, there is ongoing investigation into the potential clinical significance of using catheters infused with antimicrobial agents to prevent infections associated with PD (203). Consequently, we anticipate the potential use of catheters impregnated with anti-inflammatory medications as a therapeutic approach to reduce catheter-induced alterations and offer benefits to patients undergoing PD. However, it is important to conduct additional testing to ensure the safety and effectiveness of these PD tubes.",
        "These events can potentially trigger both acute or chronic inflammation, resulting in damage to the peritoneal membrane and a gradual deterioration of its functioning. The role of mesothelial cells and other recruited cells is essential in initiating sterile inflammation and the subsequent decline of the peritoneal membrane. The inflammatory response is intricately intertwined with a complex network of extracellular signals produced by various types of cells residing or circulating within the peritoneal membrane. Here, we offer a thorough depiction of the key extracellular factors and cellular components that contribute to the communication between the immune system and peritoneal stromal cells. The exploration of the intricate cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the sterile inflammation of the peritoneal membrane carries substantial significant in both fundamental research and clinical practices. This comprehension contributes to the development of therapeutic approaches focused on alleviating deterioration and reinstating the homeostasis of the peritoneal membrane.",

    "title": "Safety and efficacy of edoxaban monotherapy after bioabsorbable polymer everolimus-eluting stent implantation in a human-like coronary atherosclerotic porcine model. the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation after coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. However, the appropriateness of direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) monotherapy at the time of stent implantation remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DOAC monotherapy, specifically using factor Xa inhibitors such as edoxaban, in a low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDL-R(-/-)) miniature pig model of human-like unstable coronary plaques compared to conventional dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). METHODS: We evaluated the safety and efficacy of edoxaban monotherapy in the LDL-R(-/-) pig model with human-like unstable coronary plaques induced by a high-cholesterol, high-fat diet. Animals underwent DES implantation, followed by four weeks of treatment with either edoxaban monotherapy (3 mg/kg/day) or the DAPT regimen (aspirin 100 mg/day and clopidogrel 75 mg/day). Outcomes were assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (iMap-IVUS), and histology. Key endpoints included in-stent thrombus formation, neointimal thickness, and coronary plaque composition. RESULTS: Edoxaban monotherapy demonstrated a significantly thinner neointimal layer (120.0 [92.5-160.0] mum vs. 210.0 [180.0-240.0] mum, p < 0.001) and smaller neointimal area (1.06 [0.82-1.46] mm(2) vs. 1.84 [1.61-2.24] mm(2), p < 0.001) compared to DAPT. Neointimal coverage, fibrin deposition, and inflammatory cell infiltration were comparable between groups. No in-stent thrombi were observed in either group. iMap-IVUS findings indicated that edoxaban monotherapy significantly suppressed the increase in lipidic and necrotic plaque area while promoting fibrotic area expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Edoxaban monotherapy demonstrated superior efficacy in suppressing neointimal hyperplasia and stabilizing coronary plaques compared to DAPT with equivalent safety in preventing in-stent thrombus formation. These results provide important preclinical evidence supporting the potential of DOAC monotherapy as an antithrombotic strategy after DES implantation and warrant further investigation in clinical trials.

      "abstract": "Background The combination of antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs increases the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation after coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. However, the appropriateness of direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) monotherapy at the time of stent implantation remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DOAC monotherapy, specifically using factor Xa inhibitors such as edoxaban, in a low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDL-R −/− ) miniature pig model of human-like unstable coronary plaques compared to conventional dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Methods We evaluated the safety and efficacy of edoxaban monotherapy in the LDL-R −/− pig model with human-like unstable coronary plaques induced by a high-cholesterol, high-fat diet. Animals underwent DES implantation, followed by four weeks of treatment with either edoxaban monotherapy (3 mg/kg/day) or the DAPT regimen (aspirin 100 mg/day and clopidogrel 75 mg/day). Outcomes were assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (iMap-IVUS), and histology. Key endpoints included in-stent thrombus formation, neointimal thickness, and coronary plaque composition. Results Edoxaban monotherapy demonstrated a significantly thinner neointimal layer (120.0 [92.5–160.0] μm vs. 210.0 [180.0–240.0] μm, p < 0.001) and smaller neointimal area (1.06 [0.82–1.46] mm 2 vs. 1.84 [1.61–2.24] mm 2 , p < 0.001) compared to DAPT. Neointimal coverage, fibrin deposition, and inflammatory cell infiltration were comparable between groups. No in-stent thrombi were observed in either group. iMap-IVUS findings indicated that edoxaban monotherapy significantly suppressed the increase in lipidic and necrotic plaque area while promoting fibrotic area expansion. Conclusions Edoxaban monotherapy demonstrated superior efficacy in suppressing neointimal hyperplasia and stabilizing coronary plaques compared to DAPT with equivalent safety in preventing in-stent thrombus formation. These results provide important preclinical evidence supporting the potential of DOAC monotherapy as an antithrombotic strategy after DES implantation and warrant further investigation in clinical trials.",

        "Two decades have passed since the advent of drug-eluting stents for coronary artery disease. Advances in stent material, structure, and the drugs and polymers applied to the stents have significantly reduced the incidence of stent restenosis and thrombosis. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), combining aspirin and P2Y12 antagonists, is obligatory for deploying metallic stents in coronary arteries [1]. In recent years, the duration of antiplatelet therapy has been progressively shortened [[2], [3], [4]]. Conversely, the aging population has led to an increase in the number of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). These individuals require oral anticoagulants (OACs) and are often prescribed both antiplatelet and OAC drugs when undergoing coronary artery stenting. However, triple therapy involving DAPT and warfarin carries a risk of bleeding [5].",
        "Over the past decade, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that dual therapy, combining antiplatelet drugs and DOACs, specifically factor Xa inhibitors or thrombin inhibitors, can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with AF undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with metallic stents [[6], [7], [8]]. In addition, Yasuda et al. reported that DOAC monotherapy was sufficient after one year of stent implanation [9]. Consequently, a recent trend has emerged to recommend reduced and shorter antithrombotic therapy [2,3,10].",
        "While it would be beneficial if DOAC monotherapy could be considered acceptable from the time of stent implantation in patients with coronary artery disease and AF, the safety and efficacy of this approach remain uncertain. This uncertainty stems from the formidable challenge of the validating the safety and efficacy of DOAC monotherapy in humans.",
        "To address this gap, we have developed a low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDL-R−/−) miniature pig model. These pigs, subjected to a high-cholesterol and high-fat (HCHF) diet for four months, exhibit human-like coronary plaques [11]. This animal model holds immense value because it allows experimental simulation of conditions and responses of coronary arteries that are difficult to verify in humans.",
        "Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of DOAC monotherapy, specifically edoxaban, from the time of DES implantation. We are using a porcine model with human-like coronary atherosclerotic plaques to evaluate in-stent thrombus response as a measure of safety and neointimal response as an indicator of efficacy.",
        "All animal care and experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Basic Guidelines for Conduct of Animal Experiments published by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, Japan. The experimental protocol was approved by the Safety Committees for Gene Recombination Experiment of Nihon University (2020M8) and the Institutional Committee for the Use of Laboratory Animals of Nihon University School of Medicine (AP19MED030).",
        "The LDL-R−/− miniature pigs with human-like advanced coronary plaque development used in this study were previously described in detail by Li et al. [11]. All animals were housed at the Nihon University Medical Research Support Center, and standard animal husbandry procedures were previously described [12] and followed. To accelerate the development of coronary artery plaques, 3-month-old male LDL-R−/− miniature pigs were fed an HCHF diet (1 kg/day) throughout the experiment. The HCHF diet was prepared by adding 1.5 % cholesterol and 15 % powdered fat (Feed one Co., Ltd, Kanagawa, Japan) to standard pig chow. After 4 months of feeding the HCHF diet, the pigs were anesthetized with 3 % sevoflurane after sedation with midazolam (0.5 mg/kg, im). Using a general sterile technique, a 6F vascular sheath was inserted through the carotid artery, and heparin (100 IU/kg) was injected prior to catheterization. We performed coronary angiography and deployed bioabsorbable-polymer everolimus-eluting stents (SYNERGY stent, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) guided by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) (OptiCross catheter and iLab system, Boston Scientific) (Fig. 1). A 3.0 × 20 mm or 3.5 × 20 mm stent was implanted in the right coronary artery and left anterior descending coronary artery. The stents were deployed at the site of the most intense atherosclerosis in each coronary artery. At the selected site, the balloon was inflated to achieve a stent-to-artery ratio of 1.1:1. Pigs received one of the following oral antithrombotic therapy regimens (for 4 weeks starting 3 days before stent implantation and until the end of the study): aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) (DAPT group, n = 5) or edoxaban (3 mg/kg/day) (edoxaban group, n = 5). A flowchart of the study protocol is shown in Fig. 1A. The dose of edoxaban was derived from our preliminary experiments (Supplementary Figure); the dose of 3 mg/kg/day in pigs is equivalent to the anticoagulant activity of 60 mg/day in humans [13]. These blood concentrations of edoxaban were measured by SNBL (Kagoshima, Japan).

        "At 4 weeks after stent implantation, OCT analysis was conducted following established procedures [14] using a frequency-domain OCT imaging system (C7 ILUMIEN OCT Intravascular Imaging Systems, Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA). In this study, a 2.7-F OCT imaging catheter (Dragonfly, Abbott Vascular) was advanced distal to the stented lesion, and an automated pullback was initiated to coincide with blood clearance facilitated by the injection of contrast media. The automatic pullback rate was 20 mm/s, with a frame rate of 100 frames/s.",
        "OCT images were assessed using software (OPTIS, Abbott Vascular) as described previously [15]. Cross-sectional OCT images were analyzed at 1-mm intervals within the stented segment, 5 mm proximal and distal to the stent edges. Cross-sections featuring side branches or poor-quality OCT images were excluded from the analysis. Lumen and stent areas were delineated in each analyzed cross-section, and neointimal areas were calculated as [stent area–lumen area]. Neointimal thickness was measured exclusively at each stent strut, determined by automated measurements from the center of the luminal surface of each strut blooming to the lumen contour, as detailed previously [16].",
        "Prior to stent implantation and at 4 weeks after stent implantation, IVUS was conducted. To assess the changes of native coronary artery wall with DOAC monotherapy, 10 mm proximal region to the stent implantation site, as measured by gray-scale IVUS, was analyzed in cross section at 1 mm each, using iMap-IVUS virtual histology software, specifically echoPlaque 4.0 (INDEC Medical Systems, Los Altos, CA, USA), as described previously [17]. In brief, vessel and lumen borders were delineated using automatic edge detection and manually corrected when necessary. Plaque components were then classified as fibrotic (light-green), lipidic (yellow), necrotic (pink) or calcified (light-blue). These components are presented as percentages (%) of the total plaque area.",
        "Following CAG and intracoronary imaging analysis, the pigs were immediately sacrificed. The coronary arteries were removed from the heart and whole stent segments were perfusion-fixed in 10 % buffered formalin for 48 h to wash away circulating blood components. then embedded in plastic with the strut. After polymerization of the plastic, stents were segmented at 3–5 mm intervals and histologic sections were cut at 5 μm with a tungsten carbide knife. The specimens were stained with hematoxylin-eosin or Masson's trichrome. Histological sections that had been damaged during the cutting or staining procedures were excluded.",
        "Histological evaluation was performed as previously described [12]. The numbers of covered and total stent struts for the section were counted to calculate the ratio of struts covered by neointima. We considered stent struts to be covered if there was a microscopically detectable neointima over the struts. The neointimal thickness of the stent struts was defined as the distance from the margin of the struts to the luminal surface and was measured by image analysis software, ImageJ (ver. 1.52, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) [18]. For all histological sections, obtained from porcine specimens, the area of fibrin deposition and the inflammation scores were evaluated. Area of fibrin deposition, defined as a reddish area around the stent struts on Masson's trichrome staining, was measured by ImageJ. The area of fibrin deposition was divided by the number of stent struts in each section, to facilitate comparison between the sections. Inflammation scores around the struts were semi-quantitatively graded by observation of 5 high power fields (HPF) per section. Scores were defined as follows: Grade 0, absent, few inflammatory cells except some infiltrating foreign body giant cells; Grade 1, mild, no more than 20 inflammatory cells; Grade 2, moderate, no more than 50 inflammatory cells; Grade 3, severe, more than 50 inflammatory cells per HPF. The maturity of neointima was evaluated in specimens harvested from the LDL-R−/− miniature pigs. Mature neointima is considered to contain SMCs, which are eosin- and α-SMA-positive, while immature neointima is largely composed of extracellular matrix, containing proteoglycans which are alcian-blue-positive, with a few SMCs [19]. The assessment was performed for the neointima above the stent struts and that distant from the stent struts. We randomly selected one HPF of the neointima above the stent struts per section. The ratio of the eosin-stained area per neointimal area was calculated using ImageJ. Simultaneously, the ratios of the α-SMA-stained area and the alcian-blue stained area per neointimal area were calculated in the same way to evaluate the presence of SMCs and deposition of proteoglycans, respectively. Observation of Masson's trichrome clearly indicates the difference in extracellular matrix maturity, as compared to hematoxylin–eosin, at the area adjacent to the stent struts. The mature matrix is in the intima, while the immature matrix is in the neointima. Although identification of the border between the intima and neointima can be challenging in the area distant from the struts, we traced the border between the intima and neointima close to the struts to identify the border between them. Also, some struts remained uncovered. On the other hand, the degree of re-endothelialization of the neointima was evaluated. Lumen length and the region covered by endothelial cells, which are immunohistochemically CD31-positive, were measured for each section. The ratio of the re-endothelialized region was calculated by the following formula: length of re-endothelialized region/lumen length.",
        "Data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) or median [interquartile range] for normally distributed and non-normally distributed variables, respectively. The Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare differences between groups for continuous variables, and the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables. All statistical analyses were performed using RStudio (version 2022.07.1, RStudio, Inc., Boston, MA, USA), an integrated development environment for R (version 4.2.1, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
        "Changes in blood lipid components over time are shown in Fig. 1B–E. LDL-R−/− pigs fed the HCHF diet were severely hyperlipidemic. Baseline and 4-week total cholesterol, triglyceride, and free fatty acid levels were comparable across both groups. The edoxaban group had lower LDL cholesterol levels at 4 weeks.",
        "As shown in Fig. 2, the stent struts were almost completely covered in both groups. The mean neointimal thickness in the edoxaban group was significantly thinner than that in the DAPT group (120.0 [92.5–160.0] μm vs. 210.0 [180.0–240.0] μm, p < 0.001).

        "This animal study demonstrated the in-stent responses to edoxaban monotherapy, a factor Xa inhibitor, after DES implantation, using both intracoronary imaging analysis and histologic examination. The results of the study provide evidence of the safety of edoxaban monotherapy from the time of DES implantation. While previous studies have suggested that edoxaban monotherapy may reduce the incidence of stent thrombosis in small animal models [20], the present study demonstrates that edoxaban monotherapy is as safe as DAPT in preventing stent thrombosis in a large animal model. The advantages of conducting large animal experiments include the large size of the coronary arteries and the similarity of the porcine cardiovascular system to that of humans, making this model particularly suitable for studying coronary interventions. These factors underscore the translational relevance of our findings and highlight the novelty of extending research from small animal models to a large animal context. In addition, edoxaban monotherapy was shown to be effective in inhibiting neointimal progression after DES implantation.",
        "Large clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of DOAC monotherapy after PCI. In a recent retrospective study, Hwang et al. evaluated the efficacy of DOAC monotherapy switching one year after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [21]. The MACE incidence of DOAC monotherapy did not differ from that of combination therapy (DOAC and an antiplatelet agent). Fukamachi et al. in the PRAEDO AF trial showed that edoxaban monotherapy has acceptable clinical safety in patients with AF and stable CAD compared with edoxaban plus clopidogrel treatment [22]. In addition, the AFIRE, OAC-ALONE, and EPIC-CAD trials, which randomized patients with AF and CAD to DOACs alone or in combination with an antiplatelet agent, showed a lower risk of composite events [9,23,24]. In this animal study, no apparent in-stent thrombus was observed after stent implantation, even with edoxaban monotherapy. Mechanical injury to the vessel wall activates the coagulation system and generates factor Xa and thrombin [25,26]. In addition, exposure of blood flow to the stent struts causes turbulence and activates the coagulation system [27]. Therefore, the inhibition of factor Xa after stent placement may be effective in preventing stent thrombus formation. Previous preclinical studies have shown that factor Xa inhibitors impair platelet activation and inhibit stent thrombus formation [20,28,29]. These findings suggest that factor Xa inhibitor monotherapy without antiplatelet agents from the time of stent implantaion may be appropriate from a safety perspective.",
        "Regarding neointimal hyperplasia after stent implantation, as we have previously reported, the neointima is relatively thin after third-generation DES implantation in the porcine model [12]. Interestingly, the neointima was even thinner in the edoxaban monotherapy group. As mentioned above, vascular injury activates coagulation cascades, and these coagulation factors play important roles in cellular responses such as inflammation and proliferation through the PARs pathway [30,31]. In addition, factor Xa and PAR2 have been documented to play a pivotal role in the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells [[32], [33], [34], [35], [36]] and neointimal formation [[37], [38], [39]]. Previous preclinical studies have demonstrated that edoxaban treatment prevents maladaptive vascular remodeling [[40], [41], [42]]. Factor Xa inhibitors are known to play an important role in suppressing the progression of atherosclerosis via PAR2 [43,44]. In the present study, the neointimal coverage after stenting was comparable to that with DAPT. In addition, native coronary plaque lesions exhibited enhanced stabilization in the edoxaban monotherapy group. Considering the above, we believe that the efficacy of edoxaban monotherapy after stent implantation is superior to that of DAPT. Although our results and previous evidence support DOAC monotherapy afterPCI, Marazzato et al. emphasize that reducing the intensity of antithrombotic therapy should be considered with caution in patients at high risk of ischemic events, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, residual untreated coronary lesions, and complex PCI lesions [45].",
        "Our study has several limitations. Because only a single dose of edoxaban was examined in this study, the dose-response relationship for edoxaban in the porcine cardiovascular system remains unclear. Biological responses differ between pigs and humans, particularly the response in pigs is faster than that in humans. Regarding the small sample size, we acknowledge the concern about statistical power. This number was chosen based on similar preclinical studies to balance ethical considerations with statistical requirements. The results were statistically significant despite the small sample size of this translational study. Because immunohistochemical and molecular cell biological analyses were not performed in this study, the molecular biological mechanisms by which edoxaban inhibits thrombus formation and suppresses neointimal growth after stent implantation remain to be elucidated.",
        "Our results showed that the edoxaban monotherapy was non-inferior to DAPT after BP-EES implantation in terms of safety, such as in-stent thrombus formation, and suggested that edoxaban monotherapy was superior to DAPT in terms of re-endothelialization. In addition, edoxaban monotherapy appears to contribute to coronary plaque stabilization. These results provide as important evidence for an anti-thrombotic regimen after DES implantation.",

    "title": "CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T regulatory cells reconstitute and accumulate in the bone marrow of patients with multiple myeloma following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. immunosuppressive CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells (Treg) in the human bone marrow and it is unclear whether bone marrow-residing Treg are capable of regenerating following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This is particularly surprising since the bone marrow represents a major priming site for T-cell responses and Treg play important roles in the prevention of T-cell-mediated graft-versus-host disease and in promoting tumor escape from T-cell-dependent immunosurveillance. DESIGN AND METHODS: Applying flow cytometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and functional assays, we performed the first study on bone marrow and peripheral blood Treg in healthy donors as well as multiple myeloma patients before and after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: We found that, following the allogeneic transplantation, donor-derived CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Treg expanded faster than conventional CD4(+) T cells, leading to an accumulation of Treg in the bone marrow of transplanted patients who lack relevant thymic function. The reconstituted bone marrow-residing CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Treg of myeloma patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation consisted preferably of CD45RA(-)CCR7(-) memory T-cells and contained low numbers of T-cell receptor excision cycles, indicating that Treg had indeed expanded outside the thymus. Importantly, bone marrow-residing Treg of newly diagnosed and myeloma patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation expressed high levels of transforming growth factor beta and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, and showed a strong inhibitory function. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that allogeneic stem cell transplantation provides a short but significant window of opportunity for CD8(+) T cells before an exuberant regeneration of immunosuppressive Treg sets in. Later after transplantation, bone marrow-residing Treg probably contribute to suppressing graft-versus-host disease but may also undermine persistent immune control of multiple myeloma.

Results: TIM-3 + CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts were negatively associated with M-MDSCs at the engraftment. Both PD-1 + /TIM-3 + T cells and MDSCs at the engraftment did not differ between the patients with or without febrile episodes, oral mucositis, and enteropathy during the neutropenia period. Relative counts of PMN-MDSCs were significantly lower in MM patients who received carbapenems compared to those treated with cefepime.

        "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disease of unknown origin characterized by the uncontrollable proliferation of clonal B cell precursors that further differentiate into monoclonal immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells within the bone marrow. The abnormal plasma cells undermine physiological bone remodeling, leading to bone lesions, impairment of blood cell production, pathological fractures, and hypercalcemia, while monoclonal immunoglobulins cause kidney injury. This relatively frequent hematological malignancy is still considered incurable. Despite impressive advancements in novel anti-myeloma therapeutic approaches (from proteasome inhibitors to anti-BCMA CAR T cells), high-dose melphalan (HDM) with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains a cornerstone in the treatment for eligible patients, aiming to achieve sustained remission and improve overall survival rates. Apart from the anti-tumor effect, the myeloablative conditioning with HDM irreversibly impairs hematopoiesis. Subsequent critical pancytopenia, chemotherapy-induced inflammation, frequent post-transplant infectious complications, and re-infusion of the autologous graft containing both mature immune cells and hematopoietic precursors launch an avalanche-like production and release of a wide range of cytokines. As a result, following a one-time graft re-infusion, virtually all immune cell populations begin to reconstitute synchronously but with different dynamics. Previously, it was shown that the timely recovery of distinct lymphoid and myeloid cell populations was associated with post-transplant survival rates following both autologous and allogeneic HSCT. The favorable associations were established for cell compartments involved in anti-tumor immune response: lymphocytes [1,2], NK cells [3,4], and classical CD14+CD16- monocytes [5]. However, the functional state of cytotoxic cells matters: exhausted/senescent CD8+ T cells were found to be increased in patients with MM prior to post-transplant relapse [6]. Several research groups have reported the transient increase in T cells up-regulating immune checkpoint receptors PD-1, TIM-3, TIGIT, and others following HSCT [7-9]. Immune checkpoints play pivotal roles in maintaining immune homeostasis but also contribute to a state known as \"T cell exhaustion,\" characterized by attenuation of anti-tumor activity. On the other hand, these activated and/or dysfunctional T cells are considered promising targets for therapeutic intervention at post-transplant [6,7].",
        "Both anti- and pro-tumor immune cells of myeloid lineage reconstitute much faster compared to lymphocytes [10]. Recently, we have shown a rapid increase in myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) subsets after HDM with autologous HSCT [11]. MDSCs play a crucial role in tumor growth, promoting angiogenesis, facilitating malignant cell survival, and creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment through the secretion of various cytokines and induced enzymes (interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), arginase-1, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and inducible nitric oxide synthase) [12]. Of note, higher frequencies of MDSCs at post-transplant might be linked both to decreased and increased progression-free survival [11,13].",
        "The impact of MDSCs on the counts and functional properties of lymphocytes under the conditions of immune recovery is of particular interest, but still not fully studied. Understanding and targeting these interactions hold promise for enhancing the immune response post-autologous HSCT.",
        "The objective of our present study was to assess relationships between circulating MDSC populations and T cell subsets, up-regulating inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIM-3, as well as their intended association with several post-transplant clinical factors in patients with MM following HDM with autologous HSCT.",

        "Rapid immune recovery following both autologous and allogeneic HSCT seems to be associated with improved survival rates [10], and therefore continues to be under scrutiny. Apart from quantitative prevalence in anti-tumor immune cell populations, their functional properties appear to be of great importance. T cells upregulate inhibitory receptors PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3 under conditions of homeostatic proliferation following HSCT [8,9]. Expansion and cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes is under the control of various suppressive cells that are traditionally considered pro-tumor: regulatory T cells (Tregs), MDSCs, innate lymphoid cells, tumor-associated M2 macrophages, tolerogenic dendritic cells, N2-neutrophils, mast cells, stromal cells [18]. Among the listed cell populations, at least Tregs and MDSCs have previously been shown to recover quickly after HSCT [11,16,19,20]. Cellular interactions under the conditions of immune recovery at post-transplant are of particular interest as possible predictive biomarkers and potential targets for novel therapies. The aim of our present study was to investigate relationships between circulating MDSCs and T cells, expressing inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIM-3 in patients with MM following HDM with autologous HSCT. We also assess associations with distinct post-transplant clinical factors and the study cell populations.",
        "We and other research groups previously have shown the increase in both PD-1 and TIM-3 expressing T cell subsets [7-9] and MDSC populations [11,16] following high-dose chemotherapy with HSCT compared to their pre-transplant values. Under lymphopenic conditions, the increment in actively proliferating and functional T cells up-regulating PD-1 and TIM-3 can be stimulated with common cytokine receptor γ-chain family cytokines - IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, IL-21, - involved in homeostatic proliferation of mature lymphocytes [21,22]. Up-regulation of checkpoint inhibitory receptors during cytokine-induced peripheral expansion may be required to hinder the proliferation of inflammatory or autoaggressive T cells. At late post-transplant, however, the increase in PD-1+ and TIM-3+ T cells had been associated with early relapse [6,8].",
        "Nonetheless, we have shown that M-MDSC frequency was negatively associated with TIM-3+ and PD-1+TIM-3+ T cell subsets at the engraftment. We failed to find such correlations between circulating MDSCs and PD-1+/TIM-3+ T cells in patients with MM both before HDM [17] and following six months post-transplant. According to previous studies, the changes in MDSC and checkpoint receptor-expressing T cell content in various malignancies are predominantly unidirectional [23]. MDSCs are able to induce the expression of PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT. Besides, MDSCs realize their suppressive potential through checkpoint ligands PD-L1, galectin-9, and CD155 (for PD-1, TIM-3, and TIGIT, respectively) [24].",
        "The detected negative associations between M-MDSCs and CD4+TIM-3+ and CD8+TIM-3+ T cells (including PD-1+TIM-3+ subsets) might be a consequence of MDSC suppressive function. Following allogeneic HSCT, elevated levels of MDSCs have been associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) alleviation (reviewed in [25]). Concerning autologous HSCT, expanded MDSCs may attenuate the potential reduction in the diversity of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire at post-transplant by preventing the proliferation of re-infused mature T cells. According to the data of Pinton et al, activated T cells facilitated an increment and suppressive potential of MDSCs via the IL-10 production. MDSCs, in turn, regulated T cell functional properties through the B7-H1-PD-1 and MHC II-LAG-3 interactions and arginase-1 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase production [26]. On the contrary, J. Chen et al. found a negative correlation between activated T cells (measured by co-expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interferon-γ) and MDSC counts and functional features (viability and arginase-1 production) in human colorectal cancer specimens following anti-PD-1 treatment. In a series of in vitro assays, T cells after activation were able to decline MDSC content and suppressive potential via interferon-α/β-mediated TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-TRAIL receptor 2 interaction, additionally stimulated with TNFα [27]. The cross-talk between MDSCs and reconstituted lymphocyte populations is a complex process and needs further thorough investigations.",
        "Next, we evaluated the possible impact of several clinical factors on the content of the studied T cell and MDSC counts. During the period of post-transplant cytopenia following HDM and autograft re-infusion, most patients experienced febrile episodes, oral mucositis or enteropathy, and received appropriate medications. We found that PMN-MDSC content at early post-transplant was significantly lower in the patients who received carbapenems compared with those without antibacterial therapy and treated with cefepime during the cytopenia period. SE Lee et al. showed lower ratios of early-stage MDSCs and M-MDSCs to T cells in patients who had received carbapenems following allogeneic HSCT. Simultaneously, the use of carbapenems has been associated with both the loss of intestinal microbiota diversity and the increased occurrence of intestinal GVHD. The authors presumed that altered intestinal microbiota might be less effective at expanding MDSC populations; the latter ones subsequently lost control of GVHD [28].",
        "In our study, PMN-MDSC decline was associated with carbapenem treatment, while M-MDSCs did not statistically differ (2.80% (1.13-7.64%, N=15) vs. 4.16% (2.30-9.70%, N=30); PU= 0.27), presumably, due to relatively low number of observations or stimulating effect of G-CSF. However, the identified similarities in the changes of MDSC content following carbapenem administration in patients with MM may be of interest. Previously, Khan et al. showed that the decline in gut bacterial diversity and skew to distinct taxa in patients who underwent autologous HSCT were reminiscent of those with allogeneic HSCT. Increased fecal intestinal diversity in the cytopenia period was associated with a lower risk of death or progression [29]. Following autologous HSCT, changes in gut microbiome and interplay between regulatory cell populations (MDSCs, Tregs, etc) and convenient T cells rarely take such dramatic forms as GVHD and therefore are still under-researched.",
        "Next, we found the increment in M-MDSCs following short-term G-CSF administration in patients with MM at the engraftment. The frequency of M-MDSCs was associated with the duration of G-CSF injections, especially following adjustment to carbapenem usage. The elevation of MDSC populations in response to G-CSF stimulation in vivo is anticipated and has been described previously during HSC mobilization [11,30]. At the same time, the statistically insignificant increase in PMN-MDSCs following G-CSF was a bit unexpected. We speculate that PMN-MDSCs at post-transplant have already exhibited rapid proliferation due to intense release of myeloid-stimulating cytokines, and it's possible that a brief series of additional G-CSF injections (actually, a single one in most cases) had no impact.",
        "G-CSF is extensively utilized in the management of hematological disorders, particularly for the mobilization of HSCs and the reduction of neutropenia duration. The use of G-CSF after autologous and allogeneic HSCT is generally considered safe [31,32]. Thus, there are no apparent adverse immunosuppressive effects from the transient G-CSF-mediated MDSC elevation. Nonetheless, such consequences of colony-stimulating factors treatment should be taken into account; e.g., McCartney et al, also showing the increase in MDSCs following G-CSF administration, appealed to avoid its uncontrolled use at post-transplant [30].",
        "The limitation of our investigation is that we did not evaluate the post-transplant recovery of Tregs. It was not the scope of the study; nonetheless, it would be interesting to estimate counts of the most relevant suppressor cell populations simultaneously. In our study, we did not examine the composition and diversity of intestinal microbiota, and may just speculate regarding any crosstalk between broad-spectrum antibiotics, gut microbiome, and MDSCs following autologous HSCT. More research is necessary on this subject, which is typically underappreciated and understudied. Another limitation is the absence of data on bone marrow T cells and MDSCs at early post-transplant, but this source is not available closely after HSCT.",
        "TIM-3+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts were negatively associated with M-MDSCs at the engraftment. Putatively, M-MDSCs could hinder the expansion of T cell clones that gain an advantage at early post-transplant.",
        "Both PD-1+/TIM-3+ T cells and MDSCs at the engraftment did not differ between the patients with or without febrile episodes, oral mucositis, and enteropathy during the neutropenia period. Relative counts of PMN-MDSCs were significantly lower in patients who received carbapenems compared to those without antibacterial therapy or treated with cefepime. Presumably, altered intestinal microbiota are less effective at expanding MDSCs. Short-term G-CSF administration was associated with an increase in M-MDSCs. The frequency of M-MDSCs was associated with the duration of G-CSF injections.",

However, most of currently ongoing cardiovascular outcome trials are performed in subjects with manifest atherosclerosis and long-standing diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD) but early type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on a set of cardiovascular surrogate measurements. METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center study, we included subjects with early diabetes (postchallenge diabetes (2 h glucose > 200 mg/dl) or T2DM treated with diet only or on a stable dose of metformin monotherapy and an HbA1c < 75 mmol/mol) and established CAD. Participants were randomized to receive either linagliptin (5 mg) once daily orally or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in flow mediated dilatation (FMD). The secondary objective was to investigate the effect of linagliptin treatment on arginine bioavailability ratios [Global arginine bioavailability ratio (GABR) and arginine to ornithine ratio (AOR)]. Arginine, ornithine and citrulline were measured in serum samples with a conventional usual amino acid analysis technique, involving separation of amino acids by ion exchange chromatography followed by postcolumn continuous reaction with ninhydrin. GABR was calculated by L-arginine divided by the sum of (L-ornithine plus L-citrulline). The AOR was calculated by dividing L-arginine by L-ornithine levels. Group comparisons were calculated by using a two-sample t-test with Satterthwaite adjustment for unequal variances. RESULTS: We investigated 43 patients (21% female) with a mean age of 63.3 +/- 8.2 years. FMD at baseline was 3.5 +/- 3.1% in the linagliptin group vs. 4.0 +/- 2.9% in the placebo group. The change in mean FMD in the linagliptin group was not significantly different compared to the change in the placebo group (0.43 +/- 4.84% vs. - 0.45 +/- 3.01%; p = 0.486). No significant improvements were seen in the arginine bioavailability ratios (GABR; p = 0.608 and AOR; p = 0.549). CONCLUSION: Linagliptin treatment in subjects with CAD and early T2DM did not improve endothelial function or the arginine bioavailability ratios.

        "Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are at increased risk of macrovascular events as well as microvascular complications [1]. Endothelial dysfunction represents an early step in the process of atherosclerosis and moreover serves as a surrogate for future cardiovascular events. We and others have shown previously, that endothelial dysfunction is present in patients with coronary artery disease and early diabetes and can be improved by pharmacological intervention [2].",
        "Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors increase endogenous glucagon like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels leading to an insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells and suppression of glucagon secretion from alpha cells in a glucose dependent manner [3]. Hence, this drug class was demonstrated to lower both, fasting and post-challenge or postmeal glucose levels and consequently glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and is well tolerated.",
        "Three cardiovascular outcome trials with the DPP-4 inhibitors alogliptin, saxagliptin and sitagliptin were published and demonstrated cardiovascular safety of those molecules as compared to usual diabetes care without DPP-4 inhibitors [4–6]. Two outcome trials with linagliptin (CAROLINA [7] and CARMELINA—NCT01897532) are ongoing. All published studies included subjects with longstanding diabetes (median duration between 7.1 and 11.6 years) and it has been argued that results might be different in subjects with shorter diabetes duration.",
        "A well-known and validated cardiovascular surrogate parameter for future cardiovascular events is the dysfunction of endothelium, characterized by impairment of relaxation of the arteries in response to increased shear stress [8]. Mechanistic animal and in vitro data demonstrated, that DPP-4 inhibitions leads to improved vascular stiffening, endothelial function, vascular remodelling, suggesting potential cardiac, renal and neurologic benefits of this drug class [9, 10]. Reduction in oxidative stress, inflammatory responses or apoptosis and beneficial effects on the AGE/RAGE axis were proposed as possible molecular mechanisms leading to the vascular and renal effects observed [11].",
        "Data on the effect of DPP-4 inhibitors on endothelial function are conflicting. While Nakamura et al. [12] demonstrated an improvement of endothelial function with Sitagliptin, Ayaori and contributors [13] showed a worsening of endothelial function using the same drug.

No significant improvements were observed in the change of other endothelial function parameters such as Global Arginine Bioavailability Ratio (GABR) (change − 0.11 ± 0.35 in the LG vs. − 0.06 ± 0.39 in the PG; p = 0.608), the change of the arginine-to-ornithine-ratio (AOR) (− 0.13 ± 0.45 in the LG vs. − 0.05 ± 0.53 in the PG; p = 0.549), change in asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) (0.15 ± 0.22 µmol/L in the LG vs. 0.10 ± 0.14 µmol/L in the PG; p = 0.28), change of serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ([sICAM-1]-15 (− 272 to 103) vs. − 21 (− 134 to 310) ng/ml; p = 0.903) or change of serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ([sVCAM-1]-34 ± 84 vs. 5 ± 130 ng/ml; p = 0.431), respectively.Table 2Effect of linagliptin treatment on primary and secondary outcome parametersLinagliptinPlacebop-valueaBaseline3 monthsΔBaseline3 monthsΔGlobal Arginine Bioavailability Ratio (GABR)0.9 ± 0.360.81 ± 0.29− 0.11 ± 0.350.93 ± 0.310.86 ± 0.35− 0.06 ± 0.390.608Arginine to Ornithine Ratio (AOR)1.13 ± 0.481.02 ± 0.38− 0.13 ± 0.451.15 ± 0.361.10 ± 0.47− 0.05 ± 0.530.549FMD (%)3.5 ± 3.13.9 ± 3.30.4 ± 4.84.0 ± 2.93.5 ± 3.3− 0.5 ± 3.00.486NMD (%)14.0 ± 5.913.2 ± 6.41.1 ± 7.413.6 ± 5.212.9 ± 4.9− 0.7 ± 5.10.963sICAM-1 (ng/ml)929 (692 to 992)922 (514 to 995)− 15 (− 272 to 103)852 (547 to 1164)914 (597 to 1030)− 21 (− 134 to 310)0.903sVCAM-1 (ng/ml)755 ± 80712 ± 189− 34 ± 84713 ± 271716 ± 2645 ± 1300.431C-peptide (mg/dl) AUC370 ± 162353 ± 183− 3 ± 161371 ± 191342 ± 189− 34 ± 2110.562Glucose (mg/dl) AUC5739 ± 33594434 ± 2714− 1135 ± 26194118 ± 21324670 ± 2636481 ± 31850.456Insulin (mg/dl) AUC5456 ± 50745416 ± 3890249 ± 47665765 ± 53426508 ± 596640 ± 63570.855Free Fatty Acids (µmol/l) AUC− 15.4 ± 28.7− 15.5 ± 13.42.0 ± 28.4− 19.3 ± 16.9− 22.3 ± 19.3− 3.1 ± 18.30.452sICAM-1 serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, sVCAM-1 soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, AUC area under the curve, NMD nitroglycerin mediated dilatation, FMD flow mediated dilatationap-values based on analysis of covariance except for SiCAM-1 (Mann–Whitney-U-test for differences).

        "HbA1c was significantly reduced with linagliptin treatment − 2 (− 8 to 27) mmol/mol in the LG vs. 0.5 (− 28 to 18) mmol/mol in the PG; p = 0.029). Compared with the placebo group, subjects receiving linagliptin showed a numerical, but not statistically significant reduction of the area under curve (AUC) for glucose (Table 2). AUC for insulin, C-peptide and free fatty acids were comparable between both treatment groups (Table 2).",
        "In a subset of randomly selected 8 subjects (5 in the linagliptin and 3 in the placebo group) endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were investigated. Neither increased nor reduced mobilization of EPCs and MSC were observed in this small subgroup (see Additional file 1: Table S1).",
        "Serious adverse events occurred in 3 subjects in the LG vs. in 1 subject in the PG (p = 0.323), none of the events were related to the study medication.",
        "We investigated the impact of the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin on markers of endothelial function and postprandial lipid excursions in subjects with established coronary artery disease and early diabetes treated either with diet alone or metformin monotherapy. We observed, that linagliptin neither improves flow mediated dilation or other biochemical markers of endothelial function nor postprandial lipid levels.",
        "Animal studies suggested beneficial effects of DPP-4 inhibitors on atherosclerosis [20]. Although first human studies suggested a beneficial effect on endothelial function [12] there were others showing even a worsening of endothelial function [13], while others turned out to be neutral [14, 21].",
        "In a recent trial, Ott et al. investigated the impact of linagliptin on renal endothelial dysfunction and their data of a 4 week trial suggest the prevention of hyperglycaemia induced impaired renal endothelial function by linagliptin [22]. In contrast to our study, they focused on renal endothelial function, while we used flow mediated vasodilation as an assessment of vascular function and the major difference is, that our cohort had established coronary atherosclerosis as an inclusion criterion. Effects of linagliptin on endothelial function in subjects without manifest atherosclerosis might be different than the neutral effects observed in our cohort.",
        "Shigiyama and colleagues investigated changes in endothelial function by linagliptin treatment compared to placebo and metformin treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes and without macrovascular disease. While there was a significant improvement within the linagliptin group from baseline to study end, they were not able to demonstrate a significant improvement in the change of endothelial function compared to the other two groups [23]. The recent EFFORT trial is very similar to our trial in design, investigating subjects with early type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. They demonstrate an improvement in endothelial function measured by reactive hyperaemia-peripheral arterial tonometry by a 3 months linagliptin treatment compared to a voglibose group [24]. The major limitation of this small trial (in total 16 subjects) is the open label design without providing details on a prespecified sample size calculation in the publication.",
        "The neutral effect shown by our study fits well into the framework of the neutral cardiovascular outcome trials seen with compounds of this group [4–6]. It is also in line with the neutral results of the recently published MARLINA-T2D trial, which did not confirm previous suggestions of an improvement in acute glomerular damage measured by the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio in subjects with type 2 diabetes [25]. The novelty of our study is that compared to in particular cardiovascular outcome trials, where usually subjects with longer diabetes duration are included, we performed our study solely in subjects with earlier stages of very well controlled diabetes and established coronary artery disease, given that previous analyses were suggesting that with increasing diabetes duration interventions are less likely to have an impact on endothelial function [26]. However, our data suggest, that also in this patient group linagliptin has a neutral effect on endothelial function. Future analyses using novel-omics techniques such as metabolomics might help in finding biomarker patterns to select patient subgroups still benefiting of a particular treatment despite neutral outcome in the overall population [27].",
        "Data from a small ancillary study performed within the main trial did not show any changes in stem cell counts by linagliptin supporting a safe drug profile.",
        "One limitation of our study is that we compared linagliptin against placebo and not an active control drug. However, given that the mean HbA1c at baseline was below 53 mmol/mol, the impact of linagliptin on glucose lowering was statistically significant, but very limited in the extent, as one would expect. Therefore, the glucose lowering effect observed in the linagliptin group is very unlikely to have an influence on endothelial function. Another limitation is the trial duration of 3 months. One could argue that a longer treatment period might be necessary to demonstrate a benefit on endothelial function in a cohort already having coronary atherosclerosis. However, our neutral results fit well in the overall neutral cardiovascular effects observed for DPP-4 inhibitors in recent cardiovascular outcome trials [4–6]. Further, the overall number of subjects included, being 43, could be considered small, however, the trial was powered to demonstrate a potential relative 30% improvement in FMD, which is deemed a clinically meaningful improvement.",
        "Our study in subjects with early diabetes and established coronary artery disease demonstrates a neutral effect of linagliptin on various measurements of endothelial function. Whether this finding is also true for subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes without established cardiovascular disease, needs further investigation.",
