        "Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is a pivotal innovation in the field of targeted immunotherapy, allowing for the direct recognition of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) without requiring major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mediated antigen presentation (1, 2). The CAR structure, meticulously designed to enhance the specificity and efficacy of T cell responses, consists of an extracellular antigen-recognition domain, a hinge and transmembrane region, and an intracellular signaling domain that includes costimulatory molecules (3–6). To date, numerous researchers worldwide have made significant efforts to evaluate CAR-T cells for the treatment of a broad spectrum of hematologic malignancies, including but not limited to B-cell lymphomas, T-cell lymphomas, and multiple myeloma (MM). As anticipated, the remarkable outcomes of CD19 and BCMA-directed CAR-T cell therapy in B-cell lymphoma (7, 8) and multiple myeloma (MM) (9, 10), approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), have substantially shifted the clinical research emphasis towards the treatment of solid tumors and non-neoplastic disorders (11).",
        "SLE is a severe autoimmune disorder, affecting primarily women of childbearing age with a prevalence of 0.1% in the general population (12–14). The etiology of SLE is multifactorial, involving genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, and hormonal factors; however, the precise mechanisms remain unclear (15). It is characterized by the formation of autoantibodies and immune complex deposits, leading to the destruction or dysfunction of multiple organs and affecting patients’ lifespans to varying degrees (16, 17). SLE manifests a variety of clinical symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, skin rashes, photosensitivity, and renal inflammation (12, 18, 19). Despite advances in treatment over the past decade, which include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, antimalarial agents, and immunosuppressants, the management of SLE remains a significant challenge due to limited efficacy and adverse side effects (20–23). Given the central role of B cells in SLE pathogenesis, modulating B cell function has emerged as a key therapeutic strategy to mitigate the autoimmune response in SLE (24). Recent developments in B cell-targeting immunotherapies, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against CD20 and B cell activating factor (BAFF), have shown promise in managing severe and drug-refractory SLE (25, 26). While multiple-center studies suggest the effectiveness of these therapies in treating severe and/or drug-refractory SLE, response rates among patients vary widely, and challenges such as disease progression and relapse post-treatment persist (27, 28). Hence, research increasingly indicates that achieving more effective B cell depletion and developing durable treatments for SLE patients are emerging as promising goals (24, 29).",
        "With the advancement of innovative immunotherapies, CAR T-cell therapy holds great potential for treating patients with refractory SLE (30, 31). Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have shown the efficacy of anti-CD19 and anti-BCMA CAR-T cells in treating a range of autoimmune diseases, including SLE, by targeting CD19+ B cells or BCMA+ plasma cells or double-positive plasmablasts (32, 33). In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the registration of global clinical trials examining CAR-T therapies for SLE, with clinicaltrials.gov indicating over 30 registered trials (https://clinicaltrials.gov).",
        "Taken together, this review aims to evaluate the potential of CAR-T cell therapy in treating SLE\\-related diseases. We provide a concise summary of the main clinical advancements and potential applications of CAR-T cell therapies for SLE. Additionally, we discuss the underlying mechanisms and clinical challenges, providing valuable insights into identifying novel targets and exploring combination therapies to refine the study model and enhance clinical value.",
        "To provide a foundational understanding of CAR-T cell therapy’s mechanisms and development for effective oncology application, this section offers an overview of the CAR mechanism, structural variations, and approved CAR-T products.",
        "CAR-T cell therapy is an innovative approach to tumor immunotherapy, involving the genetic modification of T cells to express receptors that recognize tumor-specific antigens. This approach has emerged as a promising treatment strategy for a variety of malignancies. Development of CAR-T structures began in the 1990s, initially targeting B-cell lymphoma. Subsequently, the design of CAR has undergone continuous evolution and refinement (\nFigure 1\n) (34). First-generation CAR constructs rely on CD3ζ signaling for T-cell activation, yet lack intracellular costimulatory signals, which limits their in vivo expansion and persistence, impeding a durable anti-tumor response. Second- and third-generation CAR structures integrate one or more co-stimulatory molecules, such as 4-1BB (CD137) and CD28, into their intracellular domains. Others include ICOS, CD27, CD40, and OX40. These modifications are designed to enhance T-cell proliferation and survival, thereby improving clinical outcomes. Fourth-generation CAR structures, termed armored CARs, incorporate pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-7, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-21), chemokines (e.g., CCL19, CCL21), or chemokine receptors. These modifications are designed to counteract the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) by enhancing T-cell activity and survival, thereby directing CAR-T cells towards the tumor site. Fifth-generation CAR structures integrate a truncated cytoplasmic IL-2 receptor β-chain (IL-2Rβ) domain and a STAT3 or STAT5-binding moiety, enhancing the second-generation design. Upon activation, they can enhance the proliferation and activation of engineered T cells by promoting T cell receptor (TCR) and cytokine-driven JAK-STAT signaling (35, 36). In this therapy, T cells isolated from the patient are genetically modified to express a CAR structure, expanded ex vivo, and then reinfused into the patient (37). Currently, CAR-T therapy has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy, and the FDA has approved seven products for the treatment of hematological malignancies:",
        "Kymriah, a CD19-specific CAR-T product, was the first to be approved on August 31, 2017, for treating patients with refractory or relapsed B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (38).",

        "B cells and plasma cells play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of SLE. Consequently, B cell depletion offers a promising therapeutic strategy for SLE. In this context, CAR-T therapy presents an unprecedented opportunity to address the underlying immunopathology in the field of SLE by engineering T cells to specifically recognize and eliminate autoreactive B cells and plasma cells.",
        "Understanding the characteristics and pathogenesis of SLE deepens our knowledge of this complex autoimmune disease. This section details key symptoms and crucial factors, shedding light on the potential etiological mechanisms of SLE.",
        "The immunological characteristics of SLE primarily involve dysregulated immune system activation, leading to self-tissue and organ damage. Here are some key immunological features associated with SLE: (i) Increased production of autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA), anti-phospholipid antibodies, and other specified autoantibodies. These can target the body’s tissues, causing inflammation and damage (44, 45); (ii) Immune complexes form, consisting of antibodies and their antigens. These complexes can deposit in tissues, initiating an inflammatory response and resulting in damage to multiple organs (46); (iii) The increased release of inflammatory mediators, such as type-I interferons (type-I IFN), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), contributes to the inflammatory processes and tissue damage associated with SLE (47); (iv) Circulating immune complexes (ICs) in the patient’s serum trigger the complement system, leading to the depletion of significant amounts of complements C3 and C4. This consequently results in reduced levels, which are typically associated with the activity of SLE (48); (v) Impaired immune regulation, a hallmark of SLE, originates from mechanisms that fail to preserve self-tolerance. The compromised function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and other immunoregulatory components exacerbate the autoimmune responses characteristic of SLE (49, 50). (vi) Defective efferocytosis is critical for the clearance of apoptotic particles from the body, maintaining a delicate balance among a set of “find-me”, “eat-me”, and “don’t-eat-me” signals. Notably, nucleic acids, histones, nucleosomes, and monosodium urate microcrystals serve as nuclear alarmins/”find-me” signals. Such defects can lead to a variety of diseases, including autoimmune diseases (51, 52). The pathogenesis of SLE is intricate, involving cells from both the innate and adaptive immune systems (\nFigure 2\n). Key immune cells, cytokines and their signaling pathways associated with SLE are as follows.",
        "B-cell: B lymphocytes are distinguished by the presence of the B-cell receptor (BCR) on their membrane, which is physiologically responsible for recognizing pathogens and producing specific antibodies (53). During the process of maturation, B cells may develop into autoreactive B cells, characterized by their undesired expansion and activation, which can potentially trigger SLE (54). Autoreactive B cells produce autoantibodies through underlying mechanisms, including toll-like receptors 7 & 9 (TLR7 & TLR9), which are known to effectively generate autoantibodies targeting dsDNA (55). Overexpression of TLR7 exacerbates the autoimmune response by stimulating extra-follicular B cell responses and the formation of spontaneous germinal centers (Spt-GCs) (56). Conversely, TLR9 seems to have a protective function by restricting TLR7 activity, which helps to curb these processes and underscores its regulatory role in SLE pathogenesis (57). Additionally, long-lived plasma cells and short-lived plasma blasts are also sources of autoantibody production (58). Beyond their role in generating autoantibodies that induce tissue damage, B cells also serve as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in SLE. In this capacity, they initiate the activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes, thereby contributing to the disease’s progression (59).",
        "DN2 B-cell: DN2 cells, characterized by the absence of CD27, IgD, and CXCR5 expression but the presence of CD11c, are expanded in SLE patients with severe disease, including nephritis and hyperresponsiveness to TLR7 signaling, which leads to plasmablast differentiation and autoantibody production. The activation and differentiation of DN2 cells into antibody-secreting cells are driven by IL-21, produced by T follicular helper (TFH) and T peripheral helper (TPH) cells. Elevated levels of IL-21 and altered TFH/TPH activity are strongly associated with the severity of SLE (60). Moreover, BAFF signaling is critical for sustaining DN2 cells and their autoantibody production (61). Targeting IL-21, TLR7, and BAFF pathways has shown promise in modulating DN2 B-cell responses and mitigating SLE severity (62).",
        "T-cell: Autoreactive T cells are pivotal in the pathogenesis of SLE, as they regulate immune activation, inflammation, and target cell cytotoxicity. Upon activation, autoreactive T lymphocytes differentiate into helper T (Th) cells, which secrete a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that induce immune activation and inflammation (63, 64). These cytokines and chemokines recruit and activate additional immune cells, including B lymphocytes and neutrophils, furthering the production of autoantibodies and immune complex formation (29, 65, 66). Additionally, T lymphocytes interact with dendritic cells (DC) and B lymphocytes, promoting their activation and differentiation, which culminates in the formation of germinal centers within lymph nodes—a crucial site for autoantibody production (67, 68). Moreover, T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells, found in germinal centers and extrafollicular regions, are crucial for generating autoreactive B-cell clones in SLE (69, 70). Furthermore, a higher proportion of γδ-T lymphocytes in SLE patients compared to healthy donor controls suggests their role in the autoimmune response (71, 72).",
        "T-reg: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in cancer, autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammation, and infectious diseases by regulating self-tolerance and suppressing immune responses. Irregularities in the numbers of Tregs and/or defects in their function can lead to autoimmune diseases (73). For instance, Treg cells isolated from patients with autoimmune diseases exhibit impaired immune suppression and reduced expression of anti-inflammatory molecules like IL-10 and CTLA-4 (74). Therefore, for SLE and LN treatment, adoptive transfer of Tregs can be directly applied, either as polyclonal Tregs or as engineered variants with a receptor of high affinity for the target autoantigen, such as TCR-Tregs or CAR-Tregs, to eliminate or deactivate aberrant immune cells and reduce inflammation in AIDs (75). Doglio and colleagues isolated Tregs from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)s of a healthy donor, and expanded them using IL-2 and rapamycin to generate a second-generation anti-CD19 CAR. In an in vivo study using a humanized mouse model of SLE, it was observed that CD19 CAR-Tregs delayed the onset of B cell lymphopenia, produced immunomodulatory cytokines, showed no toxicity or reprogramming towards Th17 pro-inflammatory cells, and furthermore, in the inflamed organs, restored the normal composition of the local immune site (76).",
        "Neutrophils: Neutrophils are the primary cells of the innate immune system in peripheral blood circulation. Previous studies have shown that increased levels of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in SLE patients’ serum suggest an impaired clearance mechanism for neutrophil debris, a significant source of self-antigens (77). Neutrophils can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress and DNA damage, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of SLE (78). On one hand, neutrophils significantly contribute to immune dysregulation and tissue damage through the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are rich in decondensed nucleic acids and expel chromatin that can trigger specific autoreactive immune responses to nucleic acid antigens (79, 80). On the other hand, the enhanced formation of NETs coupled with their diminished clearance can trigger heightened inflammasome activation in macrophages, thereby intensifying the inflammatory response (81, 82). A recent study has further elucidated the correlation between neutrophil ferroptosis and SLE pathogenesis, identifying ferroptosis as the predominant mode of neutrophil death (83). The study also revealed the underlying mechanism: autoantibodies and IFN-γ in SLE serum enhance the binding of the transcription suppressor CREMα to the Gpx4 promoter, which in turn suppresses Gpx4 expression. This leads to elevated levels of intracellular lipid-reactive ROS, ultimately inducing ferroptosis in neutrophils (83).",
        "Apoptotic cell bodies: Lymphocytes from SLE patients frequently experience accelerated apoptosis, releasing nuclear antigens like nucleosomes into the extracellular space, which can then trigger immune responses and autoantibody formation (84). Macrophages from SLE patients often show diminished phagocytic ability, resulting in inadequate clearance of apoptotic cells (85). Furthermore, apoptotic cells in SLE often congregate in germinal centers to avoid macrophage clearance and deliver survival signals to autoreactive B cells, which may contribute to the loss of immune tolerance (86).",
        "Type-I IFN: Type-I IFN facilitates dendritic cell (DC) maturation, enhances autoimmune T cell survival, and activates autoantibody-producing B cells, primarily through sustained IFN-α production, autophosphorylation, and activation of the IFN-α receptor (IFNAR)-associated Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) (87, 88). Numerous published studies have demonstrated a correlation between elevated Type-I IFN signatures and disease severity in both newly diagnosed and established adult and pediatric SLE patients (89–91). Type-I IFN dysregulation, observable in the majority of SLE patients, disrupts peripheral tolerance and initiates chronic activation of autoreactive lymphocytes (92). Type-I IFN suppresses the maturation of microRNA-146 via overexpression of monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP-1), thereby promoting unchecked inflammation and causing excessive inflammatory gene expression in SLE (93). Several clinical trials have reported promising results in SLE patients through the use of mAbs targeting IFN or IFNAR, resulting in improvements in biomarkers and clinical outcomes (94).",
        "Pathophysiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). (A) Neutrophils initiate the pathogenic cascade in SLE by acting as key inflammatory mediators, releasing citrullinated peptides and nucleic acid antigens through NETosis, and driving Type I IFN expression. (B) Apoptotic cells contribute to SLE pathogenesis by providing ligands for Type I IFN expression and releasing HMGB1 and nucleic acids, promoting anti-nucleic acid antibody production and inflammatory cytokine expression. (C) Macrophages cause tissue damage by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8. (D) Antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including DCs, internalize self-peptides and nuclear proteins, mature, and activate naive T cells. This leads to T-cell differentiation into Th cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), activating B cells to produce autoantibodies and inducing a specific autoimmune response to nucleic acid antigens. These autoantibodies form immune complexes that cause end-organ damage, characteristic of SLE.",
        "To date, there is no definitive strategy for the treatment of SLE that can replace traditional therapies (95). Current immunotherapy drugs for SLE predominantly belong to the following categories (\nFigure 3\n).",
        "Antimalarial drugs. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which is known for its immunoregulatory, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and anti-photoallergic properties, is commonly used to treat SLE (96, 97). The administration of HCQ may potentially reduce the risk of disease exacerbation, facilitate a reduction in corticosteroid dosage, attenuate organ damage, and counteract the thrombotic effects associated with anti-phospholipid antibodies (98). In current clinical trials, patients are recommended to use HCQ at a dosage of 5 mg/kg body weight or less in order to minimize the risk of retinal complications, even during pregnancy and breastfeeding (99). Chloroquine (CQ), known for its interference with lysosomal activity and autophagy, interacts with membrane stability and alters both signaling pathways and transcriptional activity. Accordingly, CQ’s inhibition of autophagy activity can restore the immune balance between Th17 and Treg cells in SLE, thus improving the condition (100). Additionally, HCQ and CQ can bind to nucleic acids within the endosome, preventing the interaction of endosomal TLRs with their ligands and thereby inhibiting subsequent TLR activation. HCQ and CQ exert their immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting TLR7 and TLR9 signaling, which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as SLE (101–103). However, it is important to note that while the effects of HCQ and CQ on TLR signaling are well-documented, they are not believed to be the sole mechanisms of these drugs. Multiple studies have demonstrated that consistent administration of HCQ and CQ during the first five years of the disease improves treatment outcomes, whether used as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies (104). Furthermore, long-term follow-up studies have demonstrated their safety, efficacy, and diverse therapeutic benefits.",
        "Corticosteroids. In addition to antimalarials, corticosteroids such as prednisone and dexamethasone are frequently used in the management of SLE. They possess potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, which can effectively regulate the activity of SLE and relieve associated symptoms (105, 106). Additionally, corticosteroids can also interfere with the antigen-presenting process and down-regulate the expression of MHC molecules (107). Long-term corticosteroid use in SLE is significantly associated with permanent organ damage, including osteoporotic fractures, diabetes, cataracts, avascular necrosis, and symptomatic coronary artery disease (108). Higher cumulative doses and high-dose regimens are associated with increased disease duration and risk of damage. Therefore, corticosteroid therapy for SLE requires tailored strategies and close monitoring to balance benefits and manage potential adverse effects. Steroid-sparing treatments, including immunosuppressive agents and biologics such as hydroxychloroquine, can reduce dependence on corticosteroids and limit their associated damage (109).",
        "Immunosuppressive agents. Cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and activation, thereby curtailing the immune response (110, 111). The administration of these agents significantly reduces the B cell population and suppresses autoantibody production (110). These agents selectively modulate antibody production, reducing IgG and IgM levels while enhancing IgE production (112, 113).",
        "Biologics. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 antigen, depletes CD20-positive B lymphocytes through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and programmed cell death (PD), providing a robust rationale for its use in treating SLE (114, 115). In addition, rituximab may also influence the function and survival of other immune cells, cytokine secretion, and immune cell movement. These effects may contribute to its therapeutic effect in SLE (116). A recent study involved 40 Rituximab-treated patients with a median age of 14.3 years at diagnosis. Post-treatment, the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) 2000 score declined from 8 to 4 over a two-year period, and levels of complement components C3 and C4 returned to normal. Moreover, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) levels normalized within six months. Ultimately, 8 patients (20%) achieved disease control, and 35 (87.5%) experienced no flare-ups over a median 2-year follow-up, suggesting improved disease management (117). However, in several Phase III trials, Rituximab failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoints. The EXPLORER study, which focused on moderately-to-severely active extrarenal SLE, found no significant difference between Rituximab and placebo across primary and secondary endpoints (25). Additionally, the LUNAR trial, targeting LN, also failed to show meaningful efficacy differences (118). The lack of success at Phase III was attributed to factors such as high baseline immunosuppressive therapy in patients and complex disease mechanisms in SLE, potentially limiting the application of Rituximab as a monotherapy in SLE (119). These failed trials highlight the need for tailored trial designs and novel therapeutic approaches in future SLE research. Ofatumumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets CD20+ B cells, has demonstrated inhibitory effects on B lymphocyte activation (120). A single-center, retrospective case series assessed the impact of ofatumumab on B cell depletion in 16 SLE patients who had rituximab allergies. B cell depletion was achieved in 12 patients, and there were improvements in complement and autoantibody levels. Additionally, ofatumumab elicited complete or partial responses in 50% of patients, indicating its potential as an alternative for those with rituximab allergies (121). Obinutuzumab, a fully humanized type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that can induce extensive B-lymphocyte depletion, has been evaluated in clinical trials for SLE, particularly focusing on LN (122). The NOBILITY trial, a Phase II study, demonstrated that 35% of patients in the obinutuzumab group achieved Complete Renal Response (CRR) at week 52, compared to 23% in the placebo group, although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.115). By week 76, the CRR rates were 40% for the obinutuzumab group versus 18% for the placebo group, representing a statistically significant difference (P = 0.007) (123). Building on the Phase 2 results, the REGENCY trial, a Phase III study, announced in September 2024 that it met its primary endpoint. A higher percentage of patients treated with obinutuzumab plus standard therapy achieved CRR at 76 weeks compared to those receiving standard therapy alone. Furthermore, key secondary endpoints, including the percentage of patients achieving CRR with successful reduction of corticosteroid use and improvement in proteinuric response, were also met. The safety profile of obinutuzumab remained consistent with previous findings, and no new safety signals were identified. Obexelimab, a humanized high-affinity monoclonal antibody capable of binding simultaneously to CD19 and FcγRIIb, effectively inhibits the activation and proliferation of B cells, plasmablasts, and plasma cells in SLE patients (124). A recent study enrolled 104 patients, randomly assigned to receive either obexelimab or placebo. Despite lack of statistically significant outcome, 42.0% of patients treated with obexelimab (21/50) showed improvement compared to 28.6% on placebo (12/42) (P = 0.183). Overall, treatment with obexelimab led to an approximate 50% reduction in B cells (125). In addition to CD19 and CD20, B-cell activating factor (BAFF) is essential for B-cell survival and maturation. By inhibiting BAFF, Belimumab reduces abnormal B-cell activity, a central feature of SLE. Clinical trials, such as BLISS-52 and BLISS-76, demonstrated that Belimumab decreases disease activity and flare rates, improving clinical outcomes in patients with SLE (126). Belimumab has demonstrated a favorable safety profile with minimal risk of adverse effects, even with prolonged use up to 13 years, making it a suitable alternative to traditional immunosuppressive therapies (127). Belimumab received FDA approval in 2011 for treating moderate to severe SLE in individuals aged 18 and older (128). Telitacicept, a transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI)-Fc fusion protein, has shown significant clinical effects in the treatment of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) as demonstrated in a phase II randomized placebo-controlled trial. Patients receiving telitacicept, particularly at a dosage of 240 mg weekly, experienced a substantial reduction in proteinuria, with a mean decrease of 49% from baseline, which was statistically significant compared to the placebo group (P = 0.013). Importantly, telitacicept treatment resulted in continuous reductions in serum IgA, IgG, and IgM levels, indicating its immunomodulatory activity (129). Furthermore, adverse events were similar across all groups, with treatment-emergent adverse events being mild or moderate, and no severe adverse events were reported. On March 12, 2021, Telitacicept received its first approval from the NMPA in China for the treatment of patients with SLE (130). Anifrolumab, a mAb that binds to IFNAR and inhibits the activity of all type-I IFNs by blocking their binding, is the sole anti-IFN therapy that have undergone Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (94, 131). In July 2021, Anifrolumab received FDA approval in the USA for treating adult patients with moderate to severe SLE who are on standard therapy. Clinical studies are ongoing globally, and Anifrolumab is under regulatory review in the EU and Japan (132). The emergence of Anifrolumab underscores the potential for targeting type-I IFN in the treatment of SLE.",
        "Current treatments for SLE. (A) Antimalarial Drugs: Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), developed as antimalarial treatments, are now utilized for autoimmune diseases such as SLE. (B) Corticosteroids: Metacortandracin, Methylprednisone, Prednisone, Cortisone, and Dexamethasone are used extensively for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties in treating SLE. (C) Immunosuppressive agents: Cyclophosphamide, Azathioprine, Mycophenolate, Cyclosporine, and Methotrexate are used to suppress the hyperactive immune response typical of SLE patients. (D) Biologics: This class encompasses monoclonal antibodies and other biologics that target specific immune system components. Monoclonal antibodies for SLE like Rituximab (anti-CD20), Ofatumumab (anti-CD20), Obinutuzumab (anti-CD20), Daratumumab (anti-CD38), and Anifrolumab (anti-IFNAR) target B-cell surface markers. Furthermore, Belimumab targets BAFF, which is expressed on B lineage cells and plays an important role in B cell proliferation and differentiation. Bi-specific antibodies for SLE, such as Obexelimab (anti-CD19xFcγRIIb) and Blinatumomab (anti-CD19xCD3), are designed to modulate B cell or plasma cell activity in SLE.",
        "Additionally, Yiting Chen and colleagues have reported that the combination therapy of rituximab and belimumab demonstrates enhanced efficacy in treating SLE (133). The study’s findings are evidenced by a complete renal response (CRR) in 12 patients (66.7%) and an overall response (OR) in 13 patients (72.2%) within the combined treatment group.",
        "New biologics and targeted therapies in SLE target a broad spectrum of key immune players, including B/T lymphocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), plasma cells, T/B cell co-stimulation molecules, cytokines or their receptors, and various intracellular signaling pathways. Here, we summarize the promising therapeutic targets for SLE therapy, which align with recent developments in understanding the disease’s pathogenesis and the diversification of the SLE drug pipeline.",
        "BAFF-R: B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R, also known as BR3) is a type III transmembrane protein encoded by the TNFRSF13C gene. It specifically binds to BAFF (TNFSF13B), promoting the survival and activation of mature B-cells (134). BAFF and BAFF-R are essential for regulating the proliferation and survival of B cells, including autoreactive ones, during their development (135). Additionally, BAFF-R enhances CD19 expression in B cells via the NF-κB pathway, amplifying BCR signaling and p100 production (136). Ianalumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting BAFF-R, is under investigation in a randomized, double-blind phase III trial to assess its efficacy and safety in SLE patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05624749) (137). This highlights the promising potential of anti-BAFF-R CAR-T therapy as an appealing therapeutic approach for SLE.",
        "TACI: Transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), a lymphocyte-specific member of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF13B), is predominantly expressed in mature B cells (138). By engaging with BAFF and APRIL, TACI activates signaling pathways essential for plasma cell differentiation and survival, contributing to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases like SLE (139). Moreover, an enhanced TACI signal may drive the conversion of autoreactive IgM antibodies to IgG, potentially aggravating SLE (139). Consequently, TACI presents a promising therapeutic target for SLE, offering the possibility to mitigate symptoms through inhibition (140).",
        "CD22: CD22 (also known as Siglec-2) is a receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, predominantly expressed on immature and mature B cells, but not on plasma cells (141). CD22 plays a crucial role in regulating B cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Since 2015, the humanized anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody epratuzumab has been investigated for the treatment of SLE, holding promise for patients with moderate to severe active disease (142–144). Thus, modulating CD22 activity is proposed as a therapeutic strategy to alleviate SLE-associated symptoms.",
        "CD40: CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, acts as a receptor on B cells to mediate interactions between B and T cells (145). It can activate B cells and trigger multiple pathways that enhance their survival, proliferation, and development (146, 147). Research indicates that CD40 likely plays a critical role in inducing the production of autoantibodies and immunoglobulins by autoreactive B cells, which in turn contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE (148). A case-control study found that SLE cases exhibited a statistically significant higher expression of CD40 than controls (p < 0.001), with the number of CD40-positive B cells declining significantly after remission (149). Considering the upregulated CD40 in SLE patients, targeting this receptor is a promising therapeutic strategy for modulating immune responses in SLE.",
        "CD70: CD70, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein and member of the TNF ligand family, is expressed on activated T and B lymphocytes, but not on resting cells (150). It interacts with CD27 to mediate immune cell activation and survival, implicating it in SLE pathogenesis (151, 152). Theoretically, autoreactive T cells are expected to stimulate B cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, exacerbating SLE symptoms caused by autoreactive B cells. Repression of the CD70 molecule and its signaling pathways can effectively prevent T and B cell interaction, thereby ameliorating SLE (153). Consequently, CD70 presents itself as a promising therapeutic target for SLE.",
        "CD79b: BCR signaling is crucial across various stages of the B cell life cycle (154). Structurally, the BCR comprises a membrane-bound immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule noncovalently linked to CD79a (Igα) and CD79b (Igβ), which are transmembrane signaling subunits (155). CD79b is predominantly expressed on the cell surface of pre- and mature B cells in the bone marrow, facilitating B cell progression and maturation. It is essential for the development and maintenance of mature B cells (156). Additionally, CD79b contains ITAMs in its cytoplasmic domain, such as Y195 and Y206, crucial for transmitting BCR signals that are vital for B cell development and activation in response to antigens (154, 157). Previous studies have shown that targeting CD79b can inhibit B cell activation and reduce autoantibody levels in animal models (158). Consequently, CD79b presents itself as a compelling target for antibody-based therapies and CAR T-cell strategies within the realm of autoimmune disorders. These insights could inform the development of therapeutic strategies targeting CD79b for SLE.",
        "CD38: CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the NAD+ hydrolase enzyme family (159). This receptor is widely expressed in diverse immune cells, including T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells (NK), macrophages, and dendritic cells (DC) (160). CD38 plays a pivotal role in the activation, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of immune cells, and its expression levels undergo alterations in various pathological conditions such as autoimmune diseases and cancer (160, 161). A clinical study titled “Targeting CD38 with Daratumumab in Refractory Systemic Lupus Erythematosus” found that Daratumumab treatment elicited clinical and serological responses in two patients with treatment-resistant SLE. This treatment promotes the depletion of autoreactive long-lived plasma cells and correlates with decreased interferon type I activity and modulated effector T-cell response (162). Based on these findings, CD38 has become an attractive therapeutic target for SLE.",
        "CD138: CD138, also known as syndecan-1, is a type I transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan and a member of the syndecan family. It regulates various biological responses by interacting with chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules (163). CD138 is primarily expressed in plasma cells derived from B cells and is implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of SLE. Animal studies suggest that CD138 expression on T cells contributes to lupus progression in MRL/lpr mice (164). In individuals with SLE, CD138-positive T cells with a TCM phenotype rapidly activate autoreactive B cells, enhancing disease progression and autoantibody production in murine SLE models (165). A clinical study also revealed a higher number of CD138+ plasma cells in the kidneys of lupus nephritis patients, indicating their potential role in renal damage in SLE (166). These findings suggest that targeting CD138 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for active SLE patients.",
        "Conventional drugs discussed earlier have significantly improved the survival rate for individuals with SLE. Nevertheless, these treatments can often result in severe side effects and disease relapse following discontinuation (20, 167–169). Developing new treatments with comparable or higher efficacy, lower toxicity, and fewer complications is essential. Over the last decade, T cell-based therapies have gained attention for their potential in long-term SLE management and possibly a cure (170, 171). Pre-clinical studies of CAR-T cells in mice have demonstrated promising outcomes against SLE (172, 173). Monoclonal antibodies targeting B cell antigens, such as type-I and type-II anti-CD20 antibodies, have demonstrated varying degrees of efficacy in treating B cell-mediated diseases. Type-I anti-CD20 antibodies, such as rituximab, often rely on ADCC and CDC for B cell depletion, but this approach may not be as effective as anticipated due to the heterogeneity of B cell populations and the ability of some B cells to evade these mechanisms. Type-II anti-CD20 agents, such as obinutuzumab, have been associated with higher response rates due to their enhanced ability to induce direct B cell apoptosis and their prolonged serum half-life, potentially leading to a more sustained therapeutic effect. Compared to monoclonal antibodies, CAR-T cells demonstrate an enhanced capability to migrate to tumor sites and reside within the tumor microenvironment, potentially enhancing their therapeutic potential.",
        "Given that CAR-T cells predominantly target the B-cell lineage in SLE treatments, this section presents a systematic investigation into B-cell differentiation and surface antigen expression, aiming to enhance our understanding of unique role of B cells in SLE pathogenesis and antigen selection for CAR-T cell therapy for SLE (\nFigure 4\n).",
        "B-cell lineage differentiation and surface antigen expression in the immune system. B-cell lineage differentiation, from the bone marrow (left) to the lymph node (right), is crucial for the immune system and involves the sequential development of pro-B cells, memory B cells, and plasma cells. The differential expression of surface markers allows for the identification of various B-cell stages, from pro-B cells to plasma cells. Surface antigens, such as CD19, CD20, CD22, BAFF-R, and CD40, are represented at various stages, highlighting their roles in B-cell development and function. Other molecules, including APRIL, CD79b, TACI, BCMA, CD38, and CD138, are also depicted, underscoring their importance in B-cell and plasma cell activation and survival. The distinct expression profiles of these antigens serve as a guide for selective targeting in CAR-T cell therapies. BAFF-R, B-cell activating factor receptor; APRIL, A proliferation-inducing ligand; TACI, T-cell-activating and cytokine receptor; BCMA, B-cell maturation antigen.",
        "The development of B cells starts with progenitor B cells in the bone marrow, which then undergo a series of proliferation and differentiation steps, transforming the early pro-B cells (CD19+/CD22+) into pre-B cells (CD19+/CD20+/CD22+/CD40+/CD79b+) (174). Upon further differentiation into immature B cells (CD19+/CD20+/CD22+/CD40+/CD79b+/BAFFR+) in the bone marrow, these cells undergo antigen receptor gene rearrangement to generate a unique B cell receptor (BCR) on their surface during the subsequent stage of differentiation. The BCR facilitates the specific binding of immature B cells to antigens, triggering their activation and subsequent proliferation and differentiation. Subsequently, activated B cells migrate to lymph nodes or other secondary lymphoid tissues for affinity maturation (175). In this process, B cells with high-affinity binding to antigens are favored for survival and differentiation into mature B cells (CD19+/CD20+/CD22+/CD40+/CD79b+/BAFFR+/TACI+). Eventually, mature B cells emerge that express surface immunoglobulin (Ig) and possess the capacity to generate antibodies. Depending on the nature of the immune response, these mature B cells can differentiate into various cell types, including memory B cells (CD19+/CD20+/CD22+/BCMA+/CD38+/BAFFR+/CD40+/TACI+), short-lived plasmablasts (CD19+/BCMA+/CD38+/BAFFR+/CD40+/TACI+), or long-lived plasma cells (BCMA+/CD38+/CD138+/BAFFR+/CD40+/TACI+) (176). Long-lived plasma cells are crucial components of immune memory.",
        "Upon differentiation, B cells express unique surface molecules that serve as potential therapeutic targets for B cell-mediated diseases such as SLE. CD19, a key target for B cell depletion in CAR-T therapies, is expressed throughout multiple B cell stages-from pro-B cells to plasmablasts-except for plasma cells. The multifunctional role of CD19 in B cell activation, maturation, and signaling renders it an attractive target for B cell-directed therapies in SLE patients. CD20 and CD22 are expressed in B cells spanning the pre-B cell stage to memory B cells, yet are absent in plasmablasts and plasma cells. Other B cell receptors, including BCMA, CD38, and CD138, are extensively expressed in plasma cells. Additionally, BCMA and CD38 are also expressed in plasmablasts and plasma cells, thus targeting a broader spectrum of the B cell lineage. Consequently, therapeutic agents targeting these receptors can selectively target a specific subset and multi-subsets of the B cell lineage.",
        "Recent preclinical studies underscore the potential of CAR-T therapy for achieving remission in SLE and other autoimmune diseases, necessitating further investigation to optimize safety and efficacy. CD19 CAR-T cells featuring either CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory motifs were evaluated in MRL-lpr mice, a model that develops an autoimmune disease resembling SLE. CD19 CAR-T cells not only effectively prevented disease pathogenesis prior to symptom onset but also demonstrated a more sustained B-cell depletion effect and a slight additional reduction in plasma cells, potentially distinguishing them from conventional B-cell depleting therapies and highlighting their clinical utility (173). Dr. Kansal R and colleagues demonstrated that treatment with CAR-T cells resulted in decreased concentrations of anti-DNA autoantibodies to undetectable levels in two different animal models. This corresponded with improved survival in mice, resolution of proteinuria, reduction of splenomegaly, and improved skin disease (172). Additionally, CAR-T cell-treated mice exhibited a differential T cell phenotype in peripheral blood and a distinct serum proteome, characterized by reduced levels of S100-A10, cathepsin D, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and complement C4-B, while C3 levels were elevated. It is important to note that the beneficial effects of CAR-T cells in lupus nephritis observed in animal models are not consistent. For instance, in the research by Jin X and colleagues, no significant differences were observed in the levels of anti-dsDNA or in the histologic glomerular scores (172). Furthermore, CD19 CAR-Tregs were evaluated in a humanized mouse model of SLE in vivo. The CAR-Treg treatment resulted in a delayed onset of B-cell lymphopenia and restoration of the normal immune system composition in the inflamed organs, without observed toxicity or reprogramming towards Th17 pro-inflammatory cells (https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/142/Supplement%201/6813/506233).",
        "SLE involves dysregulated B cells and plasma cells, and CAR-T cells provide a potent mechanism for depleting these cells and inducing drug-free and sustained remission, particularly in refractory cases where conventional treatments fail (177). Refractory SLE denotes cases in which the disease persists despite aggressive conventional therapies, including immunosuppressive agents and biologic treatments, with affected patients frequently experience severe disease progression involving vital organs, such as the kidneys, lungs and central nervous system. Therefore, the inclusion criteria for CAR-T therapy involves severe and active SLE that has failed to respond to multiple conventional therapies (with a median of 4-7 failed therapies in some trials), active organ involvement, and high disease activity scores, such as the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) or the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG). Prior to apheresis (APH) and CAR-T administration, it is essential for patients to discontinue immunosuppressive medications in order to maintain the quality of autologous T cells for effective CAR-T production and expansion in patients (177–179). However, due to safety concerns, patients with life-threatening infections or significant comorbidities that would contraindicate the use of CAR-T therapy, or those who are not suitable for lymphodepletion, may be excluded (179). Additionally, CAR-T cell therapies, particularly those targeting CD19, have shown promise in treating refractory SLE. Conditioning chemotherapy is essential for lymphodepletion, enabling optimal expansion and function of CAR-T cells. For example, cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are commonly employed and have been shown to create a “cytokine sink” to support CAR-T expansion and persistence. However, these regimens may independently modulate SLE activity due to their immunosuppressive effects. Nevertheless, controlled studies that are able to differentiate between chemotherapy effects and CAR-T effects are currently lacking.",
        "In this section, we provide a comprehensive review of the latest clinical outcomes in both mono- or bi-specific CAR T-cell development for SLE, with a focus on clinical trials targeting B cells or plasma cells. \nTable 1\n represents an overview of CAR-T clinical trials in SLE.",

        "CD19-Specific CAR-T: Dr. Georg Schett and colleagues initially described the successful application of CD19-targeted CAR-T cells in a 20-year-old woman suffering from severe, refractory SLE (178). Subsequently, they published further clinical data involving five additional patients with refractory SLE who underwent treatment with autologous anti-CD19 CAR-T cells (180). T cells were genetically modified with an anti-CD19 CAR vector, expanded, and subsequently reinfused into the patients at a dosage of 1.0 x 10^6 CAR-T cells per kilogram of body weight, following lymphodepletion induced by fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. In all five patients, CAR-T cells rapidly proliferated, ranging from 11% to 59% of total circulating T cells. This resulted in the complete elimination of B cells post-CAR-T cell therapy. Four of the five patients achieved a SLEDAI-2K score of zero, while patient 2 had a score of 2 at 3 months. Meanwhile, all patients showed normalization of complement factor levels and a decrease in anti-dsDNA antibody levels below the cutoff, achieving drug-free remission. In addition, all patients experienced either no or only mild cytokine release syndrome (CRS). None of the patients developed immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) suggesting that this toxicity of CAR T-cell treatment may be less pronounced in patients with SLE. Overall, CD19 CAR-T cells effectively eliminate autoreactive B cells, leading to drug-free remission in patients with SLE. Notably, this remission was maintained even after B cell reconstitution. Recently reported monocentric clinical data from 15 patients, including 8 with SLE, detail their treatment with CD19-targeted CAR-T cells for refractory systemic autoimmune diseases (181). Patients underwent apheresis on day -13, followed by the initiation of lymphodepletion with intravenous fludarabine at 25 mg/m^2/day from days -5 to -3, and then with cyclophosphamide at 1000 mg/m^2/day on day -3. On day 1, patients received a single dose of 1.0 x 10^6 CD19-targeted CAR T cells per kilogram of body weight. As anticipated, the CAR-T cells rapidly expanded, and CD19+ B cells were quickly eliminated from the peripheral blood following the infusion. Additionally, 8 SLE patients achieved complete remission after three months and have maintained a SLEDAI-2K score of 0 since then. Five SLE patients, followed for 14-24 months, maintained remission despite B cell reconstitution. Moreover, complement factor C3 stayed within the normal range, proteinuria remained absent or low, and autoantibody seroconversion continued. The B cell count gradually increased, predominantly with a naïve phenotype. In summary, CD19 CAR-T cell therapy is a feasible, safe, and effective treatment for SLE.",
        "On May 30, 2024, at the EULAR 2024, JW (Cayman) Therapeutics Co., Ltd. presented clinical data for Relma-cel injection, a CD19-targeted CAR-T cell therapy, in patients with active SLE. As of December 18, 2023, three patients in the low-dose group (2.5x10^6 cells) received a single CAR-T cell infusion and completed at least four months of follow-up, demonstrating sustained clinical improvements. SLEDAI scores for these patients decreased from baseline scores ranging from 8 to 14 to 0 or 1. All patients achieved a SLE Response Index-4 (SRI-4), and two also met the Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) criteria. Moreover, the safety profile of Relma-cel was encouraging; two patients experienced CRS, and no ICANS were observed. The ongoing investigator-initiated trial (IIT) indicates that 100% of patients who have received Relma-cel and completed at least three months of follow-up have achieved an SRI-4 response. Notably, four patients followed for up to six months have maintained their response. Following infusion, 91.67% of the 11 patients discontinued traditional corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, easing the medication burden and potential side effects. Additionally, significant improvements in organ damage, SLE disease activity, anti-dsDNA antibody levels, and urinary protein excretion were observed. All patients achieved rapid peripheral B-cell depletion after infusion, with a median time to depletion of four days. These preliminary data suggest that Relma-cel could offer profound and enduring disease remission in patients with moderate-to-severe SLE, featuring a favorable safety profile that warrants further investigation.",
        "CD19/BCMA-Specific CAR-T: Dr. He Huang and colleagues reported the findings of a Phase I clinical trial in which 12 patients with refractory SLE were treated with CD19/BCMA CAR-T cells, according to data presented at the 2023 ASH meeting (https://ash.confex.com/ash/2023/webprogram/Paper186669.html). Participants underwent lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, administered from day -4 to day -2, preceding the sequential infusion of CD19 and BCMA CAR-T cells (at a dosage of 1.0-2.0 x 10^6 cells/kg) on day 0. Three patients received the lower dosage of 1.0 x 10^6 cells/kg for each cell type, while the remaining nine received the higher dosage of 2.0 x 10^6 cells/kg. As of July 31, 2023, BCMA CAR-T cells exhibited expansion in all patients; however, CD19 CAR-T cell expansion was not detected in one patient. Following CAR-T cell expansion, there was a notable depletion of circulating B cells. The SLEDAI-2K scores indicated a marked reduction, with the average score decreasing from 18.3 to 1.5 across all patients. Although low-level proteinuria persisted in some cases, this was likely due to previous glomerular damage. Regarding safety, all patients experienced grade 1 CRS, with no instances of ICANS. Hematotoxicity was grade 4 in 11 patients (91.7%) and grade 3 in one patient (8.3%) and was clinically manageable in all cases. Finally, B cell recovery was observed approximately three months post CAR-T therapy.",
        "Dr. Weijia Wang and colleagues conducted a clinical study involving 12 patients with SLE and LN who underwent bi-specific BCMA-CD19 compound CAR-T (cCAR-T) therapy, targeting B cells and plasma cells (33). All patients discontinued medication use after apheresis and prior to cyclophosphamide/fludarabine conditioning. Patients received a single infusion of 3.0 x 10^6 cCAR-T cells per kilogram of body weight on day 0. In terms of efficacy, plasma cells were completely eradicated within the first month. The levels of complement factors C3 and C4 normalized within 21 days. 11 of 13 patients experienced significant symptom relief within the first month, without requiring additional medication. Moreover, three patients maintained symptom-free status and medication-free remission for over a year (up to 44 months). In addition, LN patients experienced significant renal function improvement within the first 6 months.",
        "In terms of safety, cCAR-T therapy showed good tolerability, with no cases of CRS or ICANs, and no significant infectious complications were observed, meeting the specific requirement for infectious safety outcomes associated with the bi-specific BCMA/CD19 compounds. Patients were closely monitored for IgA and IgG levels, and received IVIG when necessary. The white blood cell (WBC) count normalized within 7-21 days. B cell counts reached baseline levels in all patients, with an average duration of 90 days (range: 40 to 150 days). All patients treated for more than 150 days exhibited normal levels of IgM. Given the normalization of B cells and IgM levels within 150 days, full restoration of humoral immunity is anticipated for all patients. Overall, cCAR-T cells effectively eliminate all autoantibodies, reconstitute the B cells, reset humoral immune systems, and induce long-term remission without further medication.",
        "In addition to evaluating the efficacy and safety of CAR-T therapy for SLE, recent studies have also investigated immunological changes in patients to better understand the impact of CAR-T cells. Nunez et al. analyzed the serum of six refractory SLE patients treated with CAR-T cells for inflammatory cytokines. The results revealed an increase in B cell homeostatic cytokines IL-7 and BAFF, along with a decrease in IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, three months post-CAR-T cell infusion in all six patients. Anti-DNA antibodies, used for diagnosing SLE and correlating with disease severity, were not reduced in one out of six patients under CAR-T cell treatment, suggesting that larger studies with longer follow-up periods are necessary to fully understand the effects of CAR-T therapy on SLE (182). Furthermore, Wang W et al. demonstrated that post-BCMA-CD19 compound CAR-T cells (cCAR) led to symptom and medication-free remission (MFR) and complete B cell recovery within 2-6 months. However, one patient experienced a relapse and required a second therapeutic infusion, necessitating the resumption of immunosuppressive therapy, likely due to the presence of anti-CAR antibodies (33). The essential role of autoreactive B cells in SLE pathogenesis is accompanied by a B cell-dependent increase in type-I IFN signaling, as noted by Wilhelm A et al. This underscores the potential for developing novel co-therapies, such as blocking IFN signaling and depleting B cells, to efficiently and rapidly suppress inflammation and reset autoimmunity (183).",
        "Technological advancements and compelling evidence indicate that CAR-T cell therapy is promising for treating SLE (30, 31). However, the implementation of this innovative strategy in clinical practice requires thorough preclinical and clinical research to overcome the numerous challenges. The foremost challenge in CAR-T therapy for SLE is its limited targeting scope. Considering SLE’s complexity, with its multiple autoantigens and immune pathways, current CAR-T technologies, often targeting a single antigen or pathway, may not fully address the disease’s complexity, possibly neglecting some pathogenic factors (15, 16). By targeting CD19+ B lymphocytes, CD19-specific CAR-T becomes an emerging treatment for SLE. With the limited clinical trials and follow up, CD19-specific CAR-T therapy outcomes for blood cancers and SLE across key metrics including persistence, expansion, B cell eradication and relapse were compared. In B-cell malignancies, CD19-specific CAR-T cells exhibit robust expansion and strong persistence which correlates with long-term remission but also increases the risk of toxicities like CRS, neurotoxicity and durable B cell aplasia (184). In SLE, CD19-specific CAR-T cell can rapidly deplete B cells and persist shorten. The reduced CAR-T persistence in SLE aligns with faster B cell recovery, may attribute to fewer adverse effects, reduced inflammation and remission without inducing severe immune suppression. Moreover, improper dosing regimens could heighten risks for SLE patients. Although CAR-T therapies aim to boost immune responses against specific targets, there is a concern that their use in a dysregulated immune system might exacerbate existing pathological conditions or result in unforeseen side effects. Furthermore, the efficacy and duration of CAR-T therapy differ among patients, with some exhibiting a limited response. Finally, the high cost and limited availability of CAR-T therapy, a personalized approach reliant on sophisticated technology and intricate manufacturing processes (185), may impede the widespread application of this treatment among SLE patients.",
        "Despite its demonstrated potential in treating SLE, future research on CAR-T therapy should concentrate on refining targeting mechanisms, mitigating safety risks, enhancing therapeutic efficacy, lowering preparation or medical costs, and creating universally effective treatments to maximize the clinical utility of CAR-T in SLE. In this section, we discuss the potential future applications of CAR-T therapy for the treatment of SLE (\nFigure 5\n).",
        "Combination Therapy: Combination therapy employs a variety of drugs, including immunosuppressants and biological agents, which work synergistically to enhance treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes without amplifying toxicity (186, 187). The concept is particularly appealing for SLE treatment because it promises to modulate the overactive immune response, reduce the likelihood of complications from therapy, and improve overall safety. Additionally, the combination of CAR-T therapy with biological agents such as Belimumab could potentially accelerate autoantibody clearance and suppress B cell activation prompted by BAFF (128, 188). Moreover, recent studies have underscored the potential of bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) in treating autoimmune diseases (189, 190). BiTEs are a targeted immunotherapeutic platform that directs patients’ own T cells to target cells, thereby enabling the elimination of B cells through T cell engagement (191). Blinatumomab, a BiTE targeting CD3 and CD19, has shown efficacy in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); six patients with multidrug-resistant RA observed B cell depletion and a swift reduction in clinical disease activity (189). Furthermore, teclistamab, a BiTE targeting CD3 and BCMA, has been reported to improve disease activity in patients with autoimmune diseases, including cases of severe, refractory SLE (190). Synergy among these diverse treatments could provide more effective options for managing SLE and maintaining long-term control of autoimmune activity. In the long term, the implementation of such strategies may pave the way for the development of safe and effective therapies for SLE. Nonetheless, thorough research, stringent clinical trials, and a deep comprehension of disease pathogenesis are essential for steering the future integration of CAR-T with other therapeutic strategies in SLE.",
        "Multi-specific targeting CAR-T: Multi-specific CAR strategies encompass sequential infusion, co-transduction, bicistronic vector-based approaches, and single-protein CAR constructs featuring multiple targeting domains (192). The primary advantage of multi-specific CAR-T therapy for SLE lies in its ability to target multiple relevant antigens simultaneously, enhancing precision in addressing SLE’s complex and heterogeneous nature (193, 194). Meanwhile, multi-specific CAR-T therapy can eliminate autoreactive T cells and regulate a broader immune response. This multi-action approach aims to restore immune balance and alleviate the autoimmune response by specifically targeting pathogenic cells and delivering regulatory signals. Additionally, targeting long-lived plasma cells, which produce diverse autoantibodies, contributes to SLE management. Thus, targeting autoreactive immune cells through various receptors could offer a novel and promising approach for treating SLE (33), in addition to CD19 CAR-T therapy. The potential application of multi-specific CAR-T therapy for SLE holds significant promise for the future.",
        "CAR-Treg Therapy: CAR-Treg cells demonstrate significant potential for the treatment of SLE (195). A recent investigation demonstrated that engineered CAR-Tregs can effectively suppress immune responses associated with SLE, specifically by targeting autoreactive B cells. In a humanized mouse model of lupus, CAR-Tregs delayed B cell lymphopenia and modulated immune responses without inducing toxicity (196). They are engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors and signaling domains associated with Tregs, primarily harnessing the regulatory capabilities of T-regulatory cells (197). Tregs, a distinct subset of T cells, are known for their key role in modulating immune responses. Tregs inhibit inflammatory responses and regulate autoreactive immune cells, essential for maintaining immune balance and preventing autoimmunity (198). CAR-Treg therapy holds the potential to induce long-term remission in SLE patients by promoting immune tolerance through the action of Tregs. Moreover, the inherent properties of Tregs give CAR-Tregs unique advantages over traditional CAR-T cells. While CAR-T cells target specific cells for elimination, CAR-Tregs are designed to regulate the immune system, inhibiting autoreactive B and T cells implicated in SLE development. Overall, CAR-Treg cell therapy, with its potential to improve cell-based therapy efficacy and avoid broad immunosuppression, offers a novel, targeted approach for SLE, potentially transforming treatment strategies for this intricate condition.",
        "Chimeric autoantibody receptor T Therapy: As autoantibodies are known to play a pivotal role in the progression of SLE, the development of T-cells engineered to express a chimeric autoantibody receptor (CAAR-T) holds great promise as a potential therapeutic approach for these autoimmune diseases (17, 199). Specifically, T cells were genetically modified to express a CAAR, which consists of a hinge and transmembrane domain connected to an intracellular activation domain that is identical to the traditional second-generation CARs (200). CAAR-T cells selectively target B lymphocytes expressing specific autoantibodies based on their BCR specificity, thereby inhibiting autoantibody production and preventing autoantigen presentation to T cells. This selective targeting, which does not affect the total B cell population, could potentially reduce the autoimmune response and associated inflammation without causing broad immunosuppression, which is a common side effect of current treatments. Preclinical studies have shown that CAAR-T cells are safe and effective in treating autoimmune diseases (201). Hence, CAAR-T cells may offer a platform technology for B-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, with their use in SLE treatment potentially introducing an innovative and targeted therapeutic approach. This could significantly transform the management of this complex autoimmune disorder. However, in diseases like pemphigus, the absence of intercellular antigens in the lower epidermal layers of pemphigus foliaceus leads to unique blister localization, posing challenges for antigen-specific therapies (202, 203). Additionally, the limitation of CAAR therapy is its specific targeting of autoantigens, whereas SLE involves multiple autoantibody responses against various targets, including DNA, RNA, ribonucleoproteins, and phospholipids. The diversity of autoantigens and patient heterogeneity pose challenges for a single CAAR therapy to effectively address the full spectrum of immune dysregulation (204).",
        "Optimized design of CAR-T: Given the widespread interest in CAR-T cell-based therapies, researchers have focused on developing innovative CAR structures to improve their functionality, inhibit the advancement of SLE, and mitigate adverse effects (36). The CAR design encompasses four major modules: binder, spacer, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain. Humanized binders mitigate immunogenicity, enhancing the safety and persistence of CAR-T therapies in vivo (\n205). Appropriate spacer domains are crucial for optimal target recognition and immune synapse formation (206). Differences in transmembrane domains can regulate the functional strength of CAR-T cells without impairing the antigen-binding properties of the binders and the signaling properties of T cells (206). Thus, the selection of appropriate spacer and transmembrane domains depends on the cell type and target. Additionally, immunoreceptor Tyrosine Activation Motifs (ITAMs) in the TCR-CD3 complex’s cytoplasmic domains are key phosphorylation sites essential for initiating signaling (207). In certain cases, modulating the number of ITAMs in CD3ζ or employing other TCR subunits such as CD3δ, CD3γ, or CD3ϵ can regulate T cell activation and IFN-γ release, thereby mitigating toxicity and impeding the progression of SLE (208).",
        "Universal CAR-T/NK (IPS-T/UCAR-T/NK): The development of universal CAR-T/NK (UCAR-T/NK) cell therapy represents an attractive breakthrough, potentially overcoming many limitations associated with conventional CAR-T/NK (209). UCAR-T/NK, also known as “off-the-shelf” CAR-T/NK, offers unique advantages over traditional personalized CAR-T/NK therapies (210). Firstly, the off-the-shelf nature of UCAR-T/NK eliminates the need for individual customization for each patient, significantly reducing the preparation time from manufacturing to the clinic and potentially improving treatment accessibility. Secondly, the standardized manufacturing of UCAR-T/NK reduces costs, increasing its economic viability and suitability for broad clinical use. Additionally, universal CAR-T/NK exhibits superior repeatability thanks to its standardized manufacturing method, which ensures consistent treatment outcomes. Furthermore, the logistics and management of universal CAR-T/NK are simplified as they can be prepared in advance and stored, thereby streamlining treatment complexity. While UCAR-T/NK cells may exhibit reduced in vivo persistence compared to autologous CAR-T/NK cells, future repeated infusion of CAR-T/NK could address SLE recurrence (210, 211). Overall, the application of universal CAR-T/NK cells in SLE holds significant promise due to their versatility, large-scale manufacturing capabilities, cost-effectiveness, and reproducibility.",
        "Prospects of CAR-T therapy in clinical applications. (A) Combination Therapy: Utilizes synergistic combinations of immunosuppressants, biological agents, or BiTEs to enhance efficacy and improve patient prognosis, while minimizing toxicity. (B) Bi-specific Targeting: Enables the expression of two distinct chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) within a single T cell or across different T cells, engineering the CAR-T cells to recognize multiple antigens and target various cell populations. (C) CAR-Treg Cell Therapy: Introduces CAR-Treg cells targeting autoreactive immune cells, utilizing inhibitory cytokines and immune checkpoint pathways (CTLA4, LAG-3) to suppress activation and induce immune tolerance. (D) CAAR-T Cell Therapy: Highlights the potential of chimeric autoantibody receptor T cells (CAAR-T cells) to target autoreactive B cells via the B cell receptor (BCR), offering a promising therapeutic strategy for SLE. (E) Optimized CAR design for SLE: Schematic diagram of the molecular composition of CAR-T cells, including signaling domains such as CD3ζ with varying immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which modulate T cell activation and cytokine release, crucial for managing treatment-related toxicity.

        "SLE, a complex autoimmune disease, is characterized by autoantibody production and immune system dysfunction, leading to organ damage (15–17). Advancements in therapeutic strategies have markedly improved patient outcomes since the mid-20th century, attributed to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents (105, 106, 110, 111). Recent studies increasingly show the pivotal role of abnormal B-cell or plasma-cell activation in SLE, making B-cell or plasma-cell targeted therapies a promising strategy (24). Despite the development of many monoclonal or bi-specific antibodies targeting B cells, their efficacy is still limited with a high relapse rate (25, 26). CAR-T cell therapy represents a new era in treating SLE (Figure 6), as its prolonged in vivo persistence offers a new horizon for achieving sustained remission and potentially curing the disease, as demonstrated by clinical trials (30, 31). Potential applications of CAR-T cell therapy in SLE include targeting B cells, plasma cells, and autoantigens, modulating immune homeostasis, and reduction of disease activity (31). Hence, this article provides a comprehensive exploration regarding the rationales and applications of CAR-T in treating SLE, clarifies the critical immunological features of the disease, summarizes the clinical safety and efficacy of this approach in eliminating B cells and plasma cells in SLE or LN patients, and highlights the limitations of current CAR-T therapy. Moreover, this article offers insights for guiding novel CAR-T development and optimization, presenting an overview of the advancements, unmet medical needs, and potential applications associated with using either autologous or universal CAR-T cells as a therapeutic strategy in addressing SLE and LN. The continued pursuit of preclinical and clinical investigations is crucial to refine and validate CAR-T cell therapy, which will bring us closer to a new era in the treatment of SLE or other relevant autoimmune diseases.",
        "Procedure and outcomes of CAR-T cell treatment in SLE patients. (A) The CAR-T cell therapy procedure for SLE includes the isolation and purification of T cells from the patient. These T cells are then prepared for CAR-T cell therapy through lentiviral transfection, followed by in vitro proliferation. Subsequently, the CAR-T cells are infused intravenously into patients preconditioned with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

Activation Syndrome (MAS) is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome that can occur in patients with severe infections, malignancy or autoimmune diseases. It is also a rare complication of haematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with a high mortality. It may be associated with graft vs. host disease in the allogeneic HSCT setting. It is also reported following CAR-T cell therapy, but differentiation from cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is challenging. Here, we summarise the literature and present results of a survey of current awareness and practice in EBMT-affiliated centres of sHLH/MAS following HSCT and CAR-T cell therapy. Methods: An online questionnaire was sent to the principal investigators of all EBMT member transplant centres treating adult patients (18 years and over) inviting them to provide information regarding: number of cases of sHLH/MAS seen in their centre over 3 years (2016-2018 inclusive); screening strategies and use of existing diagnostic/classification criteria and treatment protocols. Results: 114/472 centres from 24 different countries responded (24%). We report estimated rates of sHLH/MAS of 1.09% (95% CI = 0.89-1.30) following allogeneic HSCT, 0.15% (95% CI = 0.09-5.89) following autologous HSCT and 3.48% (95% CI = 0.95-6.01) following CAR-T cell therapy. A majority of centres (70%) did not use a standard screening protocol. Serum ferritin was the most commonly used screening marker at 78% of centres, followed by soluble IL-2 receptor (24%), triglycerides (15%), and fibrinogen (11%). There was significant variation in definition of \"clinically significant\" serum ferritin levels ranging from 500 to 10,000 mug/mL. The most commonly used criteria to support diagnosis were HLH-2004 (43%) and the H score (15%). Eighty percent of responders reported using no standard management protocol, but reported using combinations of corticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, cytokine blockade, and monoclonal antibodies. Conclusions: There is a remarkable lack of consistency between EBMT centres in the approach to screening, diagnosis and management. Further research in this field is needed to raise awareness of and inform harmonised, evidence-based approaches to the recognition and treatment of sHLH/MAS following HSCT/CAR-T cell therapy.

        "Secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is a life-threatening syndrome, seen in the context of haematological malignancy, infection, and autoimmunity/immune dysregulation (1). Secondary HLH is termed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) when associated with rheumatological disease, typically in the context of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), adult onset Still's disease (AOSD), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).",
        "Secondary HLH is reported after both allogeneic and autologous haematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), particularly in association with graft vs. host disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT (2–7). Infections, in particular Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be important triggers and mortality in all cases is high (2, 4, 5, 8). Only a few studies to date have addressed incidence of sHLH/MAS post HSCT, estimating ~3–4% (2, 6, 8). Once diagnosed, the mortality of sHLH/MAS in the allogeneic HSCT setting appears to be high, with rates of up 80% reported in recent studies (6, 7). Even though reports of sHLH/MAS following autologous HSCT appear to be rare, reports of death due to sHLH/MAS in patients with refractory JIA undergoing autologous HSCT have prompted changes in immunosuppressive and infectious prophylactic regimens, leading to decreased mortality (9).",
        "Diagnosis of sHLH/MAS post-HSCT requires a high index of clinical suspicion in identifying hyperinflammation, particularly as features overlap those of severe sepsis or GVHD. Typically these include fever, several-lineage cytopenia, and multi-organ failure. Persistent fever in patients without an identified infective cause, or worsening fever in patients who have been treated for infection, should prompt consideration of sHLH/MAS (10).",
        "Serum ferritin is a useful, readily available biomarker of sHLH/MAS and can be used to gauge response to treatment (2, 5, 11, 12). It is closely related to disease activity, and both maximum levels during sHLH/MAS, and a fall of less than 50% after treatment are associated with higher mortality (13–15). A retrospective paediatric study found serum ferritin levels of >10,000 μg/mL 90% sensitive and 96% specific for HLH, but its utility in the adult post-HSCT setting has not been validated (16). Serum ferritin > 10,000 μg/mL has been associated with poor survival in patients with GVHD, but this study did not investigate if these patients had sHLH/MAS (17). There is evidence that ferritin levels are not strongly associated with presence of GVHD, so may prove a useful biomarker allowing differentiation from sHLH/MAS (18, 19). Serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (sIL-2r) have emerged as an alternative diagnostic measure in adult patients with non-HSCT related sHLH/MAS but are not been validated in the post-HSCT setting (20). Furthermore, recent work has identified elevated serum levels of multiple cytokines and chemokines at the onset of sHLH/MAS following allogeneic HSCT, which may indicate a state of allo-reactivity, as seen in GVHD, which may precipitate sHLH/MAS (5). Histological identification of haemophagocytosis is recognised as a late feature and does not correlate as well as fever or serum ferritin with clinical diagnosis (21–23). Therefore demonstration of haemophagocytosis is not considered essential for diagnosis, and may only be detected if bone marrow samples are taken in the later stages of disease.",
        "Various classification criteria exist for sHLH/MAS, some derived from familial HLH and others from rheumatological practice in JIA (summarised in Table 1) (24, 26, 27). A diagnostic calculator, the “H score,” takes into account clinical and laboratory features to calculate a percentage probability of sHLH/MAS in adults (25). With the lack of validated diagnostic criteria for sHLH/MAS in adult patients in general, and post-HSCT patients in particular, it is possible to take a pragmatic approach, utilising the “H score” whilst recognising its limitations. The H-score was based on a single-centre retrospective study of sHLH/MAS and of the 43% of included patients who had diagnosed haematological malignancy, it is not reported if any had already undergone HSCT. Studies of the performance of the H-score in detecting sHLH/MAS have been encouraging, particularly in the early clinical stages of the disease, where the H-score appears to outperform HLH-2004 criteria (28, 29).",
        "Use of published criteria to support the diagnosis of sHLH/MAS post-HSCT or CAR-T cell therapy.",
        "Where post-HSCT patients are unwell, febrile, with a serum ferritin of >10 000 μg/L and present with no proven infection except for the presence of recognised triggers of HLH such as EBV and other herpes viral reactivations/infections, they can be considered in a “hyperinflammatory state” and should be considered for aggressive immunosuppression, as per published recommendations (1, 16, 30). Indicators of a poor prognosis include neurological dysfunction, acute kidney injury and acute respiratory distress (1).",
        "Effective treatment of sHLH/MAS requires aggressive immunosuppression, controlling the hyperinflammatory state, in combination with targeted treatment addressing triggering factors. Prompt recognition and treatment is important and reduces mortality in cases of sHLH/MAS secondary to autoimmune disease (31).",
        "Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of induction treatment, although over half of patients may be steroid-resistant (32). Dramatic responses are reported with the addition of CSA in doses of 2–7 mg/kg/day (33, 34). Anakinra, an IL-1 antagonist, is effective in refractory sHLH/MAS and relatively safe in patients with sepsis (35, 36). Anakinra is now at the forefront of treatment in sJIA-triggered sHLH/MAS and shows promise in adult sHLH/MAS in the intensive care setting (37, 38). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions may also be effective in steroid-resistant and EBV-triggered sHLH/MAS (39). Rituximab improves overall clinical outcomes and is an important part of EBV clearance in patients with EBV-triggered sHLH/MAS or EBV-driven malignancies (40, 41). Case reports of refractory sHLH/MAS, in patients who had not already undergone HSCT or CAR-T cell therapy, note complete responses with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or DEP regimen (doxorubicin, etoposide, methylprednisolone) and partial responses with alemtuzumab (42).",
        "A treatment protocol for sHLH/MAS accepting the heterogeneity of this syndrome and irrespective of preceding HSCT or CAR-T cell therapy has been recently published (1). First line treatment is with intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) 1g/day for 3–5 days plus IVIG 1g/kg for 2 days, which can be repeated at day 14. If there is evidence of established sHLH/MAS or clinical deterioration, Anakinra is added, 1–2 mg/kg daily increasing up to 8 mg/kg/day until sufficient clinical response. CSA is considered for early or in steroid-resistant disease. Etoposide should be considered in refractory cases. There should be parallel consideration of identifying and eradicating triggers, such as EBV, bacterial infection, and underlying malignancy, particularly lymphoma. There are no validated guidelines for treating sHLH/MAS post-HSCT and there are concerns about using the HLH-2004 protocol, especially with the inclusion of etoposide (43).",
        "CAR-T cell therapy, whilst emerging as an effective treatment for both haematological and non-haematological malignancy, is associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS), an acute toxicity resulting in hyperinflammation. Patients can present with CRS across a spectrum of severity, from low-grade constitutional symptoms to higher-grade systemic illness with multi-organ dysfunction and, in its most severe form, this can progress to fulminant sHLH/MAS. Neelapu et al. have proposed diagnostic criteria for sHLH/MAS in patients with CRS post-CAR-T cell therapy demonstrating peak serum ferritin measurement of >10,000 μg/L and two of the following findings: grade > 3 increase in serum transaminases or bilirubin; grade > 3 oliguria or increase in serum creatinine; grade > 3 pulmonary oedema or histological evidence of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow or organs (44). They also recommend specific treatment with corticosteroids and anti-IL-6 therapy (Tocilizumab or Siltuximab) alongside supportive care (44).",

This corresponded to an estimated sHLH/MAS rate of 1.09% (CI 0.89–1.30%) and 0.15% (CI 0.09–5.89), after allogeneic and autologous HSCT, respectively. Seven cases of sHLH/MAS were reported in 201 patients having received CAR-T cell therapy, giving an estimated rate of 3.48% (CI 0.95–6.01).",

        "One hundred and six centres responded to the questions, with 74 (70%) reporting using no agreed approach to screening for sHLH/MAS in their centre.",
        "Whilst only 32 centres reported using a standard protocol, 80 centres reported use of screening markers, with ferritin being the most reported biomarker in the multiple-choice options (Figure 1).",
        "Use of clinical/laboratory markers to screen for sHLH/MAS post-HSCT or CAR-T Cell therapy.",
        "For the 22 centres that performed CAR-T cell therapy, 4 (19%) reported no screening and 11 (52%) reported screening when there is clinical suspicion. Six centres (29%) reported unique routine screening protocols and one centre did not respond.",
        "Regarding CRS, 3 out of 14 centres (21%) reported that they did not use any clinical or laboratory features to help them differentiate sHLH/MAS from CRS. Of the 11 centres that did, the frequency with which laboratory parameters were used is reported in Figure 2.",
        "Use of laboratory features to differentiate between sHLH/MAS and CRS following CAR-T cell therapy.",
        "Though it was the most commonly reported marker of sHLH/MAS, there was great variation in what was considered a “clinically significant” serum ferritin level. The most commonly reported cut-off values are reported in Figure 3. The responses to this question were free text and a further 10 different values (not shown in Figure 4) were reported, ranging from 10 to 8,000 μg/L.",

        "For the remaining 83 centres, the criteria in use are reported in Figure 4 and a summary of the criteria components is presented in Table 1.",
        "Only 20% of the 100 responding centers reported using a standard protocol for sHLH/MAS management.",
        "Of these 20 centres using a treatment protocol, 4 used the MD Anderson recommendations (44). Other centres specifying their protocols reported using HLH-2004 (24) (n = 2), recommendations from La Rosee et al. (45) (n = 1) and the HLH-94 protocol (46) (n = 1) (Table 2). Whilst “international guidelines” and “HLH international society guidelines” were also reported in the survey as standard protocols, the responders did not specify to which these refer, but they may refer to the HLH-2004 guidelines produced by the Histiocyte society (24). No further specific protocols were reported.",
        "Use of published protocols in the management of sHLH/MAS post-HSCT or CAR-T cell therapy.",
        "When asked which agents are used to treat sHLH/MAS there were 16 different responses from 97 centres. The most frequently reported combinations were corticosteroids +chemotherapy (25%), corticosteroids + monoclonal antibodies + chemotherapy (15%), corticosteroids + chemotherapy + cytokine blockade (13%), corticosteroids + cytokine blockade (12%), and corticosteroids alone (10%). In terms of specific agents reported as being used in the management of sHLH/MAS, the most common were etoposide (n = 17), rituximab (n = 8), and tocilizumab (n = 7). A range of other agents were reported including Cytosorb®, ruxolitinib, CSA, IVIG, anakinra, ATG, alemtuzumab, methotrexate, vincristine, baricitinib, and siltuximab.",
        "We surveyed the EBMT community to assess current awareness and clinical diagnostics and management of this serious and frequently life-threatening complication of HSCT/CAR-T cell therapy. Estimates of incidence or prevalence of sHLH/MAS post-HSCT currently rely on post-hoc case reporting in a context of no agreed or validated diagnostic or therapeutic guidelines or criteria in the EBMT community. The survey reported here included 114 centres from 24 countries, a wider volume and spread than the several hundred cases reported in other publications, mainly from single centres (2, 8, 27).",
        "We report an estimated rate following allogeneic HSCT of 1.09% and much lower estimate of 0.15% following autologous HSCT. This is slightly higher than an EBMT study including 15 centres from 2005 to 2009, which identified sHLH/MAS in 0.3% of patients (5/1,423) undergoing allogeneic HSCT (47). The estimated rate from our survey and the EBMT study are lower than incidence reports in other studies, at ~3–4% (2, 6, 8). Whilst estimated rates and formal measures of prevalence and incidence cannot be directly compared, the differences may suggest that in centres where prospective study is performed, more cases are being identified, suggesting under-recognition in general HSCT practice. These other studies used specific criteria to diagnose sHLH/MAS, whilst our survey sought to understand the heterogeneity of sHLH/MAS approaches and therefore did not limit diagnosis to such specific criteria.",
        "We report a rate of sHLH/MAS following CAR-T cell therapy of 3.48%. Previously, sHLH/MAS has been reported in ~1% of patients undergoing CAR-T cell therapy in a single centre (44). To our knowledge this is the first formal report of rates across multiple centres. As sHLH/MAS is considered a severe manifestation of CRS, our higher diagnostic rate may reflect evolving experience of CAR-T cell therapy and greater awareness of associated current recommendations as to the detection and management of the CRS-sHLH/MAS spectrum.",
        "Seventy per cent of centres reported using no standard screening protocols to identify sHLH/MAS post-HSCT/CAR-T cell therapy. Of those reporting their screening markers (with or without the use of a standard protocol), the most common marker was serum ferritin (71%) though this was often used in combination with fibrinogen, triglycerides, bone marrow analysis and less commonly sIL-2R or NK cell function. These, in combination, are all components of existing scores, such as the H-score and HLH-2004 criteria (24, 25). Again, this highlights a heterogeneous approach to screening amongst centres, using markers validated in other patient groups. Until robust study into reliable markers of sHLH/MAS in the post-HSCT/CAR-T cell setting is undertaken, we expect continuing diversity in approaches used throughout EBMT centres.",
        "A clear theme of this survey was the use of serum ferritin as a screening marker and as part of diagnostic criteria. There was significant variation in what was regarded as a “significant” ferritin result. The median cut-off value deemed significant was 3,000 μg/L (IQR 1,000–10,000 μg/L). Interestingly, this median is similar to the optimum cut-off for HLH recommended by Basu et al. (48) of 3,120 μg/L (albeit in paediatric patients and not in the post-HSCT setting). As already discussed, what constitutes significant hyperferritinaemia in the post-HSCT setting is as yet undefined and further study is needed to define appropriate cut-off ranges to inform novel screening and diagnostic criteria.",
        "Following CAR-T cell therapy specifically, serum ferritin > 10,000 μg/L is observed in patients with all grade of CRS, not just in those with the higher grades (49). Of the 9 centres that reported using specific clinical or laboratory features to make this differentiation, 7 (78%) reported the use of serum ferritin to make the distinction between CRS and SHLH/MAS. There were no direct reports of using the MD Anderson criteria suggested by Neelapu et al. (44).",
        "In terms of diagnosis of sHLH/MAS the responders again showed a heterogeneous approach. The most frequently cited criteria were HLH-2004 (24) and the H-score (25), neither of which are validated in the HSCT setting. The only specific diagnostic criteria in the HSCT setting was produced by Takagi et al. (27), and 8 centres reported using it to aid in diagnosis. This was only studied in patients undergoing umbilical cord transplantation and has not been validated in larger, more generalised HSCT studies. The work of Abdelkefi et al. used an adapted criteria for identifying sHLH/MAS post-HSCT, incorporating bilineage cytopenia, fever, bone marrow findings and a serum ferritin > 1 000 μg/L (2, 50). With no consensus on appropriate diagnostic criteria, there is considerable variation in the definition of sHLH/MAS post-HSCT, which makes further study into this condition problematic.",
        "In terms of management of sHLH/MAS, a majority of responders (80%) reported an absence of standard protocols, in keeping with the lack of evidence in this population. As expected, protocols which were used included the HLH-2004 protocol and seem to predominately involve use of corticosteroids ± chemotherapeutic options. Etoposide was a commonly reported agent, in keeping with the HLH-2004 recommendations, though there are concerns about using etoposide in the post-HSCT setting (24, 43). Only 35% of centres reported using cytokine blockade (in different combinations with other therapeutic classes), which has revolutionised the management of sHLH/MAS in other settings, though its benefit has not been studied in the post-HSCT setting. IVIG use was reported and has features in recent recommendations for managing sHLH/MAS in any setting (1). Ruxolitinib, a janus kinase inhibitor, use was also reported and has shown varied response in multiple case reports, including patients with EBV- and non-EBV driven HLH, but promising results in a recent pilot studies including 40 patients sHLH/MAS (51–55). Again, there is no evidence of its efficacy in the post-HSCT setting but this is an agent to consider in the future. As most CAR-T cell therapies will have been performed in clinical trials, with more rigorous monitoring and with clear management advice around CRS and sHLH/MAS than general HSCT practice, we were not surprised to find frequent use of the MD Anderson criteria in our survey (44).",
        "This survey had several limitations. We surveyed the EBMT community with a 24.1% response rate (114/472). Therefore we have not collected data from a majority of EBMT centres, which limits the robustness of our epidemiological estimates. Furthermore, as our denominator, we took the total number of HSCT performed in a centre over the 3-year period, but did not specify if these were all “first-time” transplants. There may have been patients included multiple times in the denominator if they underwent repeated HSCT, which this study was not designed to identify. All surveys are prone to responder bias and we are aware this survey may have been preferentially responded to by groups already recognising sHLH/MAS in their post-HSCT cohorts and may not truly represent the community as a whole. However as 69/114 responding centres reported 0 cases managed we believe this bias is reasonably mitigated.",
        "This retrospective analysis relied on the EBMT PI recalling cases of sHLH/MAS managed in the post-HSCT/CAR-T cell therapy setting over a 3-year period (2016–2018). The time period of inclusion was restricted to 2016–2018 and we consider all cases declared during this interval and all transplant activity of responding centres over the same time period. A case diagnosed in 2016 could have been related to a transplant performed before 2016 and some cases related to transplants between 2016 and 2018 could only be diagnosed after 2018. The design of the survey didn't allow such discrimination. Furthermore, prospective, rather than retrospective studies which are prone to bias, are favoured in providing accurate incidence estimates and we should consider this in future work (56). We asked PIs to report on the number of cases they had diagnosed but did not scrutinise how this diagnosis was made, in comparison to previous smaller-centre reports, which have used specific criteria (2, 8, 27). Cases may simply have been forgotten by the clinician or incorrectly diagnosed in the past or not recognised, which is a limitation of this work, however, with this being a rare and often devastating complication we hoped cases would be retained and recalled by EBMT centres. The design of this survey did not allow for review of mortality in this cohort but it has been reported up to 83% in recent case reviews (6, 7).",
        "Secondary HLH/MAS is a relatively rare and serious complication of HSCT and CAR-T cell therapy, which is heterogeneously defined and managed in the sampled EBMT community. Dedicated study is warranted to design and evaluate protocols for screening, diagnosis, and management.",

        "Patients with malignancies are at increased risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) due to multiple causes: vomiting related to chemotherapy, nephrotoxicity of antineoplastic drugs, or direct kidney involvement caused by the underlying malignancy or urinary tract obstruction. AKI may be severe enough to eventually require renal replacement therapies, which will increase the morbidity and mortality of these patients [1].",
        "Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is the result of a series of events leading to the rapid death of a high number of malignant cells. Lysis of these cells leads to the release of intracellular ions and metabolic byproducts into the bloodstream, resulting in hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. All these disturbances may cause serious complications such as AKI, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and even death.",
        "TLS is an oncological emergency with high morbidity and mortality, especially if the diagnosis is delayed and treatment measures are not instituted promptly [2]. The most important aspect is to rapidly identify the patients at risk for TLS, in order to start the proper prophylactic and curative treatment. It commonly occurs in patients with high-grade hematological malignancies, such as acute leukemia and Burkitt’s lymphoma, but also in large and rapidly growing solid organ tumors, especially after starting chemotherapy [3,4]. It is a life-threatening condition, being responsible for increasing the in-hospital mortality of the cancer patient by up to 79% in cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) during induction therapy [5,6]. It may occur either spontaneously, or after antineoplastic therapy such as conventional chemotherapy, corticosteroids, molecular-targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and even after radiotherapy and chemoembolization [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18].",
        "Hande and Garrow classified TLS in 1993 in two categories: laboratory and clinical TLS [19]. They used some specific parameters of which variation are usually observed during the first four days after starting antineoplastic therapy. Their definition was not including patients with spontaneous TLS, and it was modified by Cairo and Bishop in 2004 by summing up the clinical and laboratory changes that appear within 3 to 7 days after the initiation of chemotherapy, thus including patients who already have TLS at presentation, as well as those who are developing it later on (Table 1) [20]. Additionally, it is necessary to exclude other causes of AKI.",
        "Howard and colleagues made several amendments to the Cairo–Bishop definition in 2011:changes of the laboratory parameters must be simultaneous within 24 h because the patient may develop one abnormality, and later on another, unrelated to TLS (e.g., hypocalcemia associated with sepsis);symptomatic hypocalcemia has to be a criterion for clinical TLS, even when the decrease in calcium level is less than 25% of baseline;a 25% variation of a parameter is significant for the diagnosis only if it causes symptoms or if the value is not within the normal range [3].",
        "changes of the laboratory parameters must be simultaneous within 24 h because the patient may develop one abnormality, and later on another, unrelated to TLS (e.g., hypocalcemia associated with sepsis);",
        "symptomatic hypocalcemia has to be a criterion for clinical TLS, even when the decrease in calcium level is less than 25% of baseline;",
        "a 25% variation of a parameter is significant for the diagnosis only if it causes symptoms or if the value is not within the normal range [3].",
        "Moreover, according to some authors [7], the definition of renal dysfunction has to be the same as the AKI definition, meaning an increase in serum creatinine by ≥0.3 mg/dL or an increase to ≥1.5 times baseline or oliguria (defined as a decrease in urine output below 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6–12 h) [21]. This will help to distinguish the patients with pre-existing kidney impairment from those who develop AKI secondary to TLS.",
        "Pathogenic mechanisms are based on the release of potassium, phosphorus, and nucleic acids during tumor cell lysis in quantities higher than the body’s homeostatic mechanisms (Figure 1).",
        "Nucleic acids (adenosine monophosphate—AMP, guanosine monophosphate—GMP) are metabolized into adenine and guanine and then to hypoxanthine and xanthine, which is finally converted into uric acid under the influence of xanthine oxidase. In mammals, uric acid is further metabolized into allantoin (a molecule 5 to 10 times more soluble than uric acid) that is excreted by the kidneys. This catabolic pathway needs the presence of urate oxidase (OU), an enzyme lacking in humans and higher primates (Figure 2). Due to abnormal high levels, uric acid may precipitate into the renal tubules, especially in association with an acidic urine, contributing to renal dysfunction [22].",
        "Tubular obstruction leads to progressive increase in proximal and distal tubule pressure and therefore to increased peritubular capillary pressure and vascular resistance. Thus, uric acid can cause kidney injury also through crystal-independent mechanisms, such as hemodynamic changes (renal vasoconstriction) [7,23] and impaired autoregulation caused by a low nitric oxide level with vasoconstriction [24]. Furthermore, high levels of uric acid cause smooth muscle cells to release cytokines that cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome: monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) [25]. Proliferation of proximal tubular cells and endothelial cells is inhibited once renal injury is produced [26].",
        "Tumor cell lysis releases large amounts of potassium into the circulation, and the uptake capacity by muscle and liver is exceeded. It is even more pronounced in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or pre-existing AKI. It can lead to muscle fatigue, paralysis, arrhythmia, and death.",
        "Cell lysis releases significant amounts of phosphate, leading to hyperphosphatemia. As in the case of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia is even more severe in the setting of pre-existing kidney impairment. Malignant cells have a four times higher level of phosphate than normal cells [27]. It seems that hyperphosphatemia is less common in spontaneous TLS, as excessive phosphate is rapidly uptaken by the remaining highly metabolically active tumor cells [28,29,30,31].",
        "High levels of serum phosphate can lead to precipitation of calcium phosphate in the renal tissue (nephrocalcinosis), especially in patients with an alkaline urine. Calcium phosphate can also precipitate in the conduction system of the heart, leading to conduction abnormalities and sometimes fatal arrhythmias. Hypouricemic therapy has evolved tremendously during the past years, so the major mechanism of AKI in TLS is represented by hyperphosphatemia and not by hyperuricemia.",
        "Another mechanism of phosphate toxicity is the binding of the calcium to the phosphate. Hypocalcemia may become symptomatic, causing neuromuscular excitability with tetany, seizures, arrhythmia, and death. Hypocalcemia may persist even after the resolution of hyperphosphatemia, possibly due to 1.25-vitamin D deficiency [32].",
        "When a calcium x phosphate product is higher than 60 mg2/dL2, there is an increased risk of calcium phosphate precipitation in the renal tubules, leading to AKI. Calcium x phosphate product over 70 mg2/dL2 is an indication for dialysis.",
        "The incidence of TLS varies from sporadic cases up to high incidence (Table 2). However, even in tumors with low risk for TLS, the patient should be closely monitored as diseases such as multiple myeloma may develop TLS due to highly efficient modern anticancer therapy [33].",
        "There is a great heterogeneity in reporting the incidence of TLS, mainly because most of the studies preceding the Cairo–Bishop criteria were retrospective and also because of the absence of uniform diagnostic criteria (some considering only clinical TLS as valid criteria).",
        "A study including 788 adults and pediatric patients with acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma demonstrated how incidence of TLS varied according to laboratory or clinical TLS—18.9% versus 5%, respectively. The incidences of laboratory and clinical TLS based on the tumor type were 21.4% and 5.2% in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 14.7% and 3.4% in AML, and 19.6% and 6.1% in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively [34]. In other studies, TLS incidence varied from 26% in ALL [35] to 32% in AML [36]. The highest risk of developing TLS is among patients with large and fast-growing tumors (e.g., Burkitt’s lymphoma B-cell ALL and AML with leukocytosis of over 100,000/mm3). The lowest incidence is among malignancies with a low multiplication rate, such as chronic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Large tumors (over 10 cm) and those with local invasion or metastases also have a high risk of TLS. Cases of catastrophic TLS in low-risk tumors are also described, for example, the reported cases of a patient receiving cetuximab for metastatic colon cancer [37], a patient with chronic leukemia who developed TLS during the first 24 h after starting imatinib [38], and a patient with renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib [39]. To the contrary, the TLS incidence may be significantly reduced in high-risk tumors (e.g., Burkitt’s lymphoma) due to aggressive prophylactic therapy with hydration and Rasburicase.",
        "Tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy, tumor extension and metastases, and associated clinical conditions (CKD, hypovolemia, hypotension) also contribute to increased risk of TLS.",
        "TLS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Proper assessment of the patients with appropriate risk stratification is of major importance for a more efficient therapeutic approach. Several risk-stratification models for TLS have been developed [41,42], most of them taking into account different patients’ characteristics (including other comorbidities) and type of neoplasia (Table 3).",
        "Tumor-related risk factors include the type of neoplasia, sensitivity to chemotherapy, tumor volume, tumor growth rate (LDH level of more than two times the NV), and leukocytosis higher than 25,000/mm3 (Table 3).",
        "Increased incidence of TLS is observed in tumors with high sensitivity to chemotherapy, such as endometrial cancer, hepatocellular carcinomas, or chronic leukemia (treated with biological therapy), cancers which are otherwise associated with low risk for this complication [3].",
        "Intrathecal chemotherapy, interferon, steroids, radiation therapy, and bortezomib–cyclophosphamide–dexamethasone combination (in patients with multiple myeloma), as well as fludarabine, rituximab, or ibrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), are often associated with TLS [46,47].",
        "Other substances and drugs (such as alcohol, caffeine, thiazide diuretics, acetylsalicylic acid, cisplatin, methyldopa, theophylline, pyrazinamide, diazoxide, ethambutol) that increase the level of serum uric acid can also increase the risk of TLS [48].",
        "The initial risk stratification model was based on the type of tumor and the level of leukocytosis [42]. Later on, other criteria were added, such as patient’s age, disease stage, histological aspects, anti-tumor therapy (cytotoxic agents and biological therapy), and kidney function [41,49].",
        "Patients are broadly classified into three risk categories: high risk (>5% of patients develop TLS), intermediate risk (1–5% of patients develop TLS), and low risk (<1% of patients develop TLS).",
        "A special situation is that of CLL, AML, and ALL, which are classified as high, low, or intermediate risk, respectively, according to the level of leukocytosis and LDH. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas are classified as high, intermediate, or low risk for TLS according to patient’s age, disease stage, and LDH level.",
        "Management should focus on identifying patients at risk to develop TLS and on prompt prophylaxis. An adequate management has the purpose of reducing the risk of AKI and preventing the major electrolyte disorders.",
        "The key of prophylaxis is to maintain an adequate urine output and to decrease the blood levels of uric acid, potassium, and phosphate. The monitoring of biological values are recommended to be done with the following frequency: every 4 to 6 h after antitumor therapy initiation for patients at high risk;every 8 to 12 h for patients at intermediate risk;daily for patients at low risk.",
        "every 4 to 6 h after antitumor therapy initiation for patients at high risk;",
        "every 8 to 12 h for patients at intermediate risk;",
        "daily for patients at low risk.",
        "In addition, it is recommended:to avoid the nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, contrast agents);to stop the treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.",
        "to avoid the nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, contrast agents);",
        "to stop the treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.",
        "Volume expansion is accomplished by crystalloids solutions, which increase the urine output and thus the phosphate, potassium, and uric acid excretion. Apart from this effect, salt delivery to the distal tubules increases potassium secretion and lowers kalemia. Decreasing the urinary calcium x phosphate product also prevents the precipitation of the crystals. Therefore, it is recommended to administer 2500–3500 mL/m2/day to children (200 mL/kg/day for those whose weight is under 10 kg) and 3000 mL/day to adults by mouth or intravenously for 2 to 3 days before chemotherapy. The urine output that should be obtained is",
        "over 100 mL/m2/h or a diuresis of 2.5 L/day for adults;",
        "over 4 mL/kg/h for children.",
        "Diuretics are not routinely recommended because they induce volume depletion, thus compromising the renal hemodynamics even more. Diuretics are used only in the case of symptomatic hypervolemia. The loop diuretics are preferred, because, in addition to increasing the urinary flow, they also increase the potassium secretion. Thiazides are contraindicated because they increase the blood levels of uric acid.",
        "Urine alkalinization favors the conversion of the uric acid to urate and decreases tubular crystals precipitation (uric acid has a solubility of 0.15 mg/dL when pH is 5, whereas urate has a solubility of 2.2 mg/dL when pH is 7). However, alkalinization decreases calcium phosphate solubility and favors crystals precipitation in renal tubules and soft tissues. Moreover, alkalosis increases the amount of calcium that is bound to albumin and favors arrhythmia and tetany. Therefore, urine alkalinization is not recommended as it may even be dangerous.",
        "Calcium is not routinely recommended, because it increases the precipitation of calcium in the soft tissues and it aggravates AKI. Calcium administration is recommended only in certain conditions: severe and symptomatic hypocalcemia (tetany, Chvostek sign, muscular fasciculation, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, seizures), changes of the electrocardiogram, and arrhythmia. In these cases, treatment is administered in order to alleviate the symptoms and not to normalize the calcemia.",
        "Hyperkalemia must be promptly treated because it can induce life threatening arrhythmias. When potassium value increases with more than 25% compared to baseline value or when kalemia reaches 6 mmol/L, cardiac monitoring is recommended, altogether with the standard treatment: beta-adrenergic agonists (albuterol), glucose-insulin solution, short calcium gluconate infusion for myocardial protection, loop diuretics, and potassium binding resins in order to increase digestive loss. When kalemia exceeds 7 mmol/L, dialysis is recommended. Special attention is needed for the drugs that may increase the potassium serum values (Table 4).",
        "Allopurinol is a purine analogue and is the isomer of hypoxanthine. It is metabolized by xanthine oxidase to oxypurinol (the active form of allopurinol), which is a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Oxypurinol has a half time of 24 h and it is excreted by the kidneys, which makes the adjustments of the doses necessary in the case of kidney dysfunction. Oxypurinol decreases the production of uric acid from xanthine, but it has no effect on the uric acid that has been already synthetized [50]. This leads to a weak response to treatment in patients with TLS and severe hyperuricemia. Moreover, in this case, the serum concentration of hypoxanthine and xanthine increases after allopurinol and xanthine can precipitate into the renal tubules, leading to AKI. Therefore, it is recommended to use allopurinol as a prophylactic treatment and not in established TLS, where it can be used only if the patient is allergic to rasburicase or has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.",
        "Doses: for adults: 200–400 mg/m2/day, divided in 1 to 3 doses, to maximum 800 mg/day;for children: 300–450 mg/m2/day in 3 doses, to maximum 400 mg/day [41].",

        "In chronic kidney disease, the dose is adjusted according to estimated glomerular filtration ratio (eGFR):20–50 mL/min/1.73 m2: 200–300 mg/day;10–20 mL/min/1.73 m2: 100–200 mg/day;<10 mL/min/1.73 m2: 100 mg/day or every 2 days.",

        "Prophylactic therapy must begin at least 24 h prior to chemotherapy initiation and must be continued for at least 7 days.",
        "Allopurinol has multiple drug interactions; therefore, it is recommended to lower the doses for 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine with 65–75% when these drugs are administered together with allopurinol. Moreover, other drugs for which doses should be adjusted in this situation are thiazides, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, ampicillin, and amoxicillin.",
        "Side effects are rare but may be life-threatening: from Steven–Johnson syndrome up to toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute toxic hepatitis, small vessel vasculitis, bone marrow aplasia, and DRESS syndrome (eosinophilia, rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, acute hepatitis, acute interstitial nephritis) [51]. Previous studies have shown that these side effects are idiosyncratic reactions [52,53].",
        "Febuxostat is a new inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. It does not induce the hypersensitivity reactions seen with allopurinol and it does not necessitate dose adjustment according to eGFR, so it is an alternative to allopurinol in certain groups of patients. The FLORENCE trial tested the efficiency of febuxostat compared to allopurinol in patients with blood malignancies and medium/high risk for developing TLS [54]. The study showed that febuxostat in a single daily dose of 120 mg/day was more efficient in preventing TLS. Another study found that febuxostat had the same efficiency as allopurinol in lowering serum and urinary uric acid levels in 45 children with ages between 5 and 15 years and hematological neoplasia, with medium and high risk of TLS [55]. In this study, febuxostat was administered in a single daily dose of 10 mg/day, a dose too small to demonstrate its better effect over allopurinol. A recent meta-analysis included six studies and was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of febuxostat compared to allopurinol as a prophylaxis for TLS; more than half of all the patients from this meta-analysis came from the FLORENCE trial. Both drugs showed a similar TLS incidence (OR 1.01, 95%CI: 0.56–1.81) and response rate (OR 1.01, 95%CI: 0.55–3.51) [56].",
        "Rasburicase is a recombinant variant of UO, derived from Aspergillus flavus. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pediatric patients with hematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy in 2002 and for adults at risk for developing TLS in 2009 [57]. Rasburicase can be used for TLS prevention in high-risk patients and for the treatment of already-constituted TLS.",
        "The efficacy and safety of rasburicase for the prevention and treatment of TLS in high-risk patients have been tested in a series of studies (Table 5) [58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72]. In one of them, it was tested in terms of its efficiency in treating hyperuricemia in patients with malignancies (1069 adults and children) and showed lower uric acid level in 99% of children and 100% of adults. Renal replacement therapies were necessary in only 2.8% of cases [73]. In a phase III study on patients at risk for TLS, Cortes et al. evaluated the uric acid lowering effect of rasburicase versus rasburicase followed by allopurinol administration, versus allopurinol. The study showed a better response for the patients treated exclusively with rasburicase. The uric acid was reduced in 87% of cases treated with rasburicase, versus 78% cases treated with rasburicase followed by allopurinol, versus 66% of cases treated with allopurinol [58].",
        "Rasburicase converts uric acid in allantoin, carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in patients with G6PD deficiency leads to methemoglobin accumulation leading to hemolytic anemia [74]. Prior to starting rasburicase administration, patients should be tested for G6PD deficiency. An initial dose of 0.05 mg/kg can be administered intravenously whenever testing is not possible. Regardless of this, these patients must be closely monitored for signs of hemolytic anemia. According to the guidelines for managing TLS in adult and pediatric patients with hematological malignancies elaborated by the British Committee of Standards in Haematology, it is recommended to administer rasburicase as a prophylaxis to high-risk patients in a single dose of 3 mg to adults and 0.2 mg/kg to children. Rasburicase administration can be repeated daily for 5–7 days when necessary (lack of response or increase in the uric acid level) [48].",
        "Rasburicase is very well tolerated with only few side effects, has less drug interactions compared to allopurinol, and has a rapid effect (it lowers uric acid level in 4 h). Rarely, it can induce rash, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, or hepatic cytolysis and it is contraindicated in pregnancy, lactating women, or patients with G6PD deficiency. Rasburicase continues to be active ex vivo, thus leading to false decreased values of uric acid if the blood sample is not immediately delivered to the laboratory in ice recipients in order to be processed in no more than 4 h after blood collection.",
        "The main therapeutic measure is the increase in phosphaturia by volume expansion with isotonic solutions. The management should also focus on dietary phosphorus restrictions and the administration of oral phosphate chelating agents (e.g., sevelamer). Dialysis is indicated when the value of the calcium x phosphate product exceeds 70 mg2/dL2, despite the therapeutic and prophylactic measures.",
        "The risk of TLS can be diminished through choosing less aggressive chemotherapy regimens in order to slowly reduce the tumor burden, allowing enough time for the compensatory kidney mechanisms to remove the products derived from tumor lysis. For example, the Berlin–Frankfurt–Muenster group treated a child with ALL by initially administering prednisone for one week before initiating induction chemotherapy [75]. For patients with Burkitt’s lymphoma, there are regimens that include a first week of treatment with low doses of vincristine, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide, followed by full doses.",
        "In the future, TLS prophylaxis may be improved by means of interfering with malignant cells multiplication and metastasis. For example, it is possible to decrease the invasive behavior by targeting the expression of desmosome junction proteins through drugs that increase the expression of these desmosomes [76]. Desmosomes are intercellular junctions whose main function is strong adhesion; +9most of the mechanisms that regulate their assembly and stability in migratory epithelial cells are still unknown [77]. A series of studies have reported a correlation between reduced desmosome expression and the invasiveness of tumors, such as transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and non-small cell lung cancer, conditions that may be associated with TLS [78,79,80], and thus it is too premature to close the chapter focusing on the prophylaxis of TLS.",
        "Due to the limited efficiency of xanthine oxidase inhibitors and side effects of intravenous rasburicase, during the past years, studies were aimed at developing oral engineered uricase. Although the kidney is the major site of elimination for uric acid, the gut also plays an important role in urate metabolism. Oral recombinant urate oxidase (ALLN-346), which targets intestinal degradation of urate, was studied in mice deficient in uricase with severe hyperuricemia and crystalline obstructive nephropathy [81]. ALLN-346 determined a significant reduction of hyperuricemia by 44% and the normalization of uricosuria.",
        "Pegloticase is a third-line treatment that was authorized by the European Medicines Agency in 2016 for the treatment of severe, refractory gout. It is given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks. Pegloticase is a recombinant porcine uricase that is pegylated to increase its elimination half-life and to decrease the immunogenicity. Like rasburicase, it is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency. NCT04745910 is a phase-IV clinical trial that will soon start patients’ recruitment. Its aim is to assess the efficiency of pegloticase compared to rasburicase in reducing uric acid levels in patients with hyperuricemia caused by TLS [82].",
        "Once established, TLS necessitates a multidisciplinary approach and a careful monitoring of some key elements: regularly checking the patient because his general status may change from one hour to another, and monitoring diuresis, laboratory tests, and possible complications.",
        "It is recommended to maintain a urine output of at least 100 mL/m2/h for adults and 4 mL/kg/h for children. Urine alkalinization is not recommended (level 1C recommendation) [48].",
        "It is recommended to administer rasburicase and not xanthine oxidase inhibitors, since they do not have any effect on the uric acid that has already been produced. The only indications for xanthine oxidase inhibitors are known rasburicase allergy and G6PD deficiency [48]. As a therapy, the recommended dose of rasburicase is 0.2 mg/kg/day, and the treatment duration must be established according to clinical response, but no more than 3 to 7 days. In contrast to the prophylactic treatment, when administration of low doses of rasburicase is supported by multiple studies, there are not enough data to support a fixed, low dose of rasburicase compared to weight adapted doses when dealing with an already constituted TLS. Some studies still recommend a fixed, single dose of 6 mg, which was found to be as effective as the weight-adapted dose [74]. Therefore, for financial reasons, this alternative treatment may be reasonable and suitable for daily administration.",
        "The necessity for renal replacement therapy (RRT) decreased dramatically in the era of hypouricemic drugs, especially in the countries where rasburicase is available for the prevention and treatment of TLS. RRT is indicated when kidney dysfunction is aggravating despite therapeutic measures, when the patient develops hypervolemia, or when electrolyte disturbances are refractory to medical treatment.",
        "The options for RRT are:daily hemodialysis;continuous veno-venous hemofiltration;combination of intermittent hemodialysis and continuous hemofiltration/hemodiafiltration for an efficient clearance of phosphate, which is time dependent. These techniques use dialysis membranes with large pores, which allow for rapid clearance of molecules that otherwise are not efficiently removed by conventional hemodialysis.",

        "TLS is a constellation of metabolic disorders that occur as a result of malignant cells lysis, related either to the treatment or to the increased rate of cells proliferation. TLS is an onco-nephrology emergency, with AKI being one of the most important predictors of short- and long-term mortality in these patients. According to TLS risk stratification, an early, aggressive, and multidisciplinary approach is mandatory in order to limit the occurrence of this condition and consequently of AKI. Nowadays, new advances in chemotherapy pose the risk of TLS developing even in patients with malignancies that were previously classified as having a low risk for this complication.",

        "Specifically for FL, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) was approved by the US Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2021 for treatment of adults with R/R FL\nafter failing two or more lines of systemic therapy.4 Similarly, in May 2022, the FDA\nalso granted accelerated approval of tisagenlecleucel for a similar\nindication.5 In addition, brexu-cel (formerly known as KTE-X19), also\nreceived USFDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with R/R MCL in June\n2020 following a priority review and FDA breakthrough therapy designation based on\nthe results of ZUMA-2.6 In this study, almost all patients had failed to respond or\nprogressed on Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis).6",
        "Here, we provide a thorough review of the pivotal studies that led to the approval of\nthese commercially available CAR Ts for FL and MCL, and we also summarize other\nstudies that have evaluated other CAR T products for the treatment of these two\ndiseases.",
        "FL represents the second most common lymphoma diagnosed in the Western\nHemisphere, with a median age at presentation of approximately\n65 years.9,10 Over 80% of patients harbor the chromosomal abnormality\nt(14;18) with consequent overexpression of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)\nprotein.11 Most patients with low-grade FL (grade 1, 2, or 3A)\npresent with advanced disease stage at initial diagnosis. Yet, treatment is not\nnecessarily required unless patients develop symptomatic disease, impaired organ\nfunction, and symptomatic cytopenias, among other reasons.12,13 When\npatients with advanced stage disease require treatment, several\nchemoimmunotherapeutic combinations can be used based on various studies\nincluding rituximab or obinutuzumab with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and\nprednisone (CVP); or rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine\nand prednisone (CHOP-R); or bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) or obinutuzumab\nshowing non-inferiority to conventional chemoimmunotherapy regimens.14–17 The combination of\nlenalidomide and rituximab remains a valid option in many patients.16 The\noutcomes of patients progressing early (within 24 months) after initial\nfirst-line containing anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (POD24) remain very\npoor.18",
        "The bulkiness and aggressive clinical presentation of the disease in patients\nwith R/R FL requiring treatment could guide treatment choice, which is often\ntailored to the patient’s performance status and existing comorbidities.\nTreatment options for second-line and beyond include chemoimmunotherapy,\nradioimmunotherapy, phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors (PI3Kis), tazemetostat\n[an inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)], and in\nsome cases, autologous (auto-HCT) or an allogeneic (allo-HCT) hematopoietic cell\ntransplant.19–26 Several PI3Kis were\nwithdrawn for the market because of safety concerns and pending results from\nphase III trial.27 Unfortunately, as the disease progresses or becomes\nmore refractory, the efficacy of conventional treatment options becomes more\nlimited with a complete response (CR) rate of approximately 13%.22",
        "Initial efforts to study the efficacy of CAR Ts in lymphoma date back to over one\ndecade ago. In 2010, Kochenderfer et al.28 treated a\npatient with advanced FL with a CD19 CAR T-cell product following a\nlymphodepleting regimen of cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day × 2 days followed by\nfludarabine 25 mg/m2/day × 5 days. The day following the fifth\nfludarabine dose, the patient received anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells in\ncombination with interleukin-2 (IL-2).28 The authors reported\nsignificant regression consistent with a partial response (PR) that lasted\napproximately 32 weeks. Moreover, the authors reported that B-cell precursors\nwere selectively eliminated from the bone marrow after infusion of\nanti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells.28 This case highlighted a\nproof-of-concept and demonstrated the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy even in the\nsetting of bulky disease.28 Nine years later, in a\nphase I/II study, Hirayama et al.29 assessed the use of\nanti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in 21 patients with R/R FL (n = 8)\nor transformed FL (n = 13). CR was achieved in 7/8 patients\nwith R/R FL (CR rate = 88%) who remained in remission after 24 months of\nfollow-up. None of the patients developed severe (grade > 3) cytokine release\nsyndrome (CRS) or neurological event (NE).",
        "In 2021, axi-cel was approved for the treatment of patients with R/R FL after\nfailing two or more lines of systemic therapy based on results of the ZUMA-5\nstudy, a single-arm, phase II, multicenter international trial.4 The primary\nendpoint of ZUMA-5 was overall response rate (ORR) as per assessment of an\nindependent radiology review committee using the Lugano\nclassification.30 In ZUMA-5, 148 patients received axi-cel [FL = 124\n(84%) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) = 24 (16%)].4 The median age of patients\nwith FL was 60 (range = 53–67) years, with 31% of cases being ⩾65 years of age.\nA total of 64 (52%) cases were reported as having a high tumor bulk using the\nGroupe d’Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires (GELF) criteria.12 The\nmedian number of prior lines of therapy was 3 (range = 2–4), and 78 (63%) had ⩾3\nlines of therapy preceding axi-cel. At a median follow-up of 17.5 months, 84\n(81%) patients with FL were eligible for the primary analysis: ORR was described\nin 79 (94%) patients and 66 (79%) patients achieved a CR.4 Median time\nto initial and to CR were 1 month and 1 month, respectively. CRS was reported in\n97 (78%) of 124 FL patients, with 8 (6%) cases being grade > 3. NEs were\nreported in 70 (56%) of 124 patients with FL; grade 1–2 and grade 3–4 NEs were\nreported in 51 (41%) and 19 (15%) FL cases, respectively. The median overall\nsurvival (OS) was not reached, and the 18-month OS was 94.1% in patients\nachieving a CR and 84.6% in those achieving a PR.4 An updated analysis of\nZUMA-5 presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology\n(ASH) in December 2021 showed that among FL patients progressing within less\nthan 2 years (POD24) after initial chemoimmunotherapy the median duration of\nresponse (MDR) was 38.6 months versus reported as not reached\nin those without POD24.31",
        "Tisagenlecleucel was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in May 2022 for the\ntreatment of adults with R/R FL after failing two or more lines of systemic\ntherapy. In the ELARA study, a phase II international study enrolling 98\npatients, the median age of patients was 57 years, and the median number of\nprior lines of therapy was 4 (range = 2–13), including 36% that had failed a\nprior auto-HCT.5 The primary endpoint was CR rate. A total of 97 out of 98\nenrolled patients received tisagenlecleucel, and CR rate was reported at 69.1%\nwith an ORR of 86.2%.5 The CRS, NE, and the immune effector cell–associated\nneurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) rates were 48.5% (grade ⩾3 = 0), 37.1% (grade\n⩾3 = 3%), and 4.1% (grade ⩾3 = 1%), respectively, with no reported\ntreatment-related deaths.5 With a median follow-up of\n17 months, a subgroup analysis of the ELARA study showed a 9-month duration of\nresponse (DOR) of 76% and a 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) of\n67%.32 The 9-month PFS in patients in CR was 85.5%.32 The\nauthors reported a lower 1-year PFS in patients with POD24 (60.8%\nversus 77.9%), those with a high baseline total metabolic\ntumor volume (TMTV, >510 cm3) (54.5% versus\n68.5%), and those who had received ⩾5 prior lines of therapy (59.6%\nversus 69.7%).32 These and other patient-,\ndisease- and treatment-related characteristics of the two studies that led to\nthe approval of axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel in FL are summarized in Table 1.",

        "MCL is a rare subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) defined by the\npresence of t(11;14)(q13; q32), resulting in cyclin D1 overexpression, while\nthere are some cases of t(11;14) negative MCL.33 Clinical presentation\nvaries from an indolent to a more aggressive course. Several trials have\nestablished the role of high-dose cytarabine plus anthracycline-based\nchemoimmunotherapy regimens, like CHOP-R or alike, as backbone therapy for\npatients with advanced disease followed by auto-HCT in first complete remission\nin fit patients.34,35–37 In the\nMCL Younger phase III trial, the use of R-DHAP (dexamethasone, cytarabine, and\ncisplatin) followed by auto-HCT improved PFS and OS after long-term follow-up\ncompared with R-CHOP/auto-HCT.38 Other non-aggressive\ntherapy would be the combination of bendamustine and rituximab.15 Various\nprospective and retrospective studies showed improved OS with the use of\nrituximab maintenance for 3 years after induction therapy with or without\nauto-HCT, with a survival advantage after auto-HCT.39,40 BTKis have revolutionized\nthe outcome of patients with R/R MCL. Targeted therapy was incorporated into\nconventional therapy with ibrutinib, a BTKi. In a study assessing the\ncombination of ibrutinib and rituximab in patients with R/R MCL, the ORR and CR\nrates were high, but not in patients with high Ki-67 (>50%).41 Patients\nrelapsing after BTK inhibitors have poor survival of 6–10 months.42",
        "In July 2022, brexu-cel was approved for the treatment of R/R MCL. This approval\nwas based on the results of the ZUMA-2 multicenter phase II trial.6 ZUMA-2\nevaluated the use of brexu-cel for the treatment of R/R MCL. A total of 74\npatients were enrolled, but only 68 received the product. Three patients had\nmanufacturing failure and two died from disease progression before infusion.\nMedian time from leukapheresis to delivery of brexu-cel was 16 days. All\npatients had received a BTKi, and had relapsed after or were refractory to this\ntherapy. In the intent to treat population, the ORR was 85%\n(n = 63 of 74), with 59% (n = 44 of 74)\nachieving a CR. The 1-year estimated PFS and OS were 61% and 83%, respectively.\nPFS was similar in all subgroups including in patients with Ki-67 >50%\n(n = 37), blastoid subtype (n = 17), tumor\nprotein P53 (TP53) mutation (n = 6), POD24\n(n = 33), and minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive\n(n = 4). The most common > grade 3 adverse events were\ncytopenias in 94% and infections in 32% of patients. CRS was seen in 91% of the\npatients, with 15% having grade ⩾3. Neurologic events occurred in 63% of the\npatients, with 31% of them having grade ⩾3. Median time from infusion to CRS and\nneurologic events occurrence were 2 and 8 days, respectively (Table 2).6 Updated\nresults after a median follow-up of 35.6 months showed a high ORR and CR rate of\n91% and 68%, respectively. The median duration of response was 28.2 months. The\nmedian PFS and OS were 25.8 and 46.6 months, respectively. Nineteen patients\nwere analyzed for MRD assessment at 6 months; 15 (79%) were MRD-negative with an\nORR of 100%. Two patients had therapy-related myeloid diseases, one with\nmyelodysplastic syndrome and another with acute myeloid leukemia at 25.2 and\n37.5 months after therapy, respectively.43 An exploratory analysis\nshowed a trend toward attenuated T-cell functionality in patients who received\nprior bendamustine. Furthermore, patients who received bendamustine within\n6 months of apheresis had lower CAR T peak compared with those who received it\nmore than 6 months prior to undergoing apheresis. These results indicate that\nbrexu-cel is safe and yields durable responses in patients with R/R MCL. The\neffect of bendamustine on T-cell functionality and CAR T peak should be further\nexplored especially with the use of bendamustine as bridging therapy or a\nlymphodepleting agent.44",

The 1-year PFS and OS were 51% and 61%, respectively, slightly\nlower than the ZUMA-2 trial results. The authors attributed this difference to\nthe higher non-relapse mortality observed in the real-world data.

        "CD19 autologous CAR T treatments have demonstrated impressive efficacy in patients\nwith R/R FL and MCL and have improved the adverse prognosis of these diseases,\nparticularly in those with high-risk features/bulky disease. Consequently, modern\ntreatment algorithms for FL, MCL, and other B-cell lymphoid malignancies nowadays\nincorporate CAR T-cell therapies as part of the recommended options for these\npatients.",
        "In the case of FL, two products are commercially available in the United States,\nnamely, axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel.4,5 Studies leading to the approval\nof these two products, namely, ZUMA-5 and ELARA, share several\nsimilarities.4,5\nFor instance, both represented single-arm phase II studies, the number of enrolled\npatients with FL was comparable at 124 and 97, respectively. Also, the median age of\npatients was also comparable 60 years versus 57 years,\nrespectively.4,5\nYet, notwithstanding the limitations of non-randomized comparisons between studies,\nthe ELARA study appears to have enrolled a higher proportion of patients with\nhigh-risk disease features [follicular lymphoma international prognostic index\n(FLIPI) high risk = 59.8% versus 44%, high tumor bulk by GELF\ncriteria = 63.9 versus 52%, refractory to last line of\ntherapy = 78.4% versus 68%, and POD24 = 62.9%\nversus 55%] (Table 1). In addition, a higher proportion\nof patients in the ELARA study had also failed a prior auto-HCT (36.1%\nversus 24%).5",
        "While acknowledging these differences, both ZUMA-5 and ELARA studies demonstrated\nimpressive efficacy with ORR of 94% and 86% and CR rates of 79% and 69.1%,\nrespectively (Table 1).\nThese results show improved outcomes of patients with R/R FL refractory to two lines\nof treatment. The traditional ORRs with EZH2 inhibitors are approximately 69%. Yet,\nCR rates remains very low (13%) compared with those seen with axi-cel or\ntisagenlecleucel.22 Given the high complete remission rates with CAR T therapy,\nwe believe that treatments like axi-cel or tisagenlecleucel ought to be the\npreferred options in patients with R/R FL that failed two or more lines of systemic\ntherapies. The optimal treatment following CAR T relapse/progression remains an area\nof future research. Although initial analysis of CAR T-cell therapies reported a\nbeneficial effect of axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel across different disease\nprognostic risk factors, a recently presented update of the ELARA study during ASH\n2021 showed an inferior 1-year PFS in patients treated with tisagenlecleucel with\nPOD24 (60.8% versus 77.9%), those with high baseline TMTV\n(>510 cm3) (54.5% versus 68.5%), and those who\nhad received ⩾5 prior lines of therapy (59.6% versus 69.7%) (Table 1).32 These\nfindings highlight the need to consider adjuvant treatment approaches to help reduce\nthe risk of relapse or progression in this high-risk population. Potential\napproaches may include incorporating targeted therapies in the post-CAR T-cell\nconsolidation/maintenance setting or, perhaps, considering an allo-HCT in patients\nwith a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible donor and who are deemed\nfit for the procedure.",
        "In terms of toxicity, ZUMA-5 reported an apparently higher incidence of CRS (any\ngrade = 78% versus 48%, grade ⩾3 = 15% versus 6%)\nand neurologic events (any grade = 56% versus 11.3%, grade ⩾3 = 6%\nversus 0) when compared with ELARA.4,5 These findings appear\nconsistent with other studies evaluating axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel in other\nhistologies.1,2\nWe believe that a better understanding of the pathogenesis of CRS and\nneurotoxicities have led to earlier diagnosis and more prompt treatment\ninterventions of these unique toxicities.48,49",
        "Pertaining to MCL, the results of ZUMA-2 showed safety and impressive efficacy of\nbrexu-cel in R/R MCL. Three-year follow-up data showed high ORR of 91% with 68% CR\nrate (Table 2). These\nresponses are much higher compared with standard of care, with ORR/CR rate of\n66%/20% and a median PFS of 12.8 months with BTKi in patients relapsing after\nchemoimmunotherapy treatments.50 Furthermore, real-world\nstudies from Europe and the United States confirm results of ZUMA-2 showing\ncomparable safety and efficacy in a population in which some patients would not have\nbeen eligible for inclusion in ZUMA-2. Furthermore, in the US consortium real-world\nstudy of brexu-cel in R/R MCL, patients BTKi-exposed and BKTi-naïve had comparable\nORR (89% versus 91%) and CR rates (79% versus\n83%). A third cohort of the ZUMA-2 trial is currently evaluating the safety and\nefficacy of brexu-cel in patients with R/R MCL who had received up to five lines of\ntherapy but not a BTKi (NCT04880434) (Table 3).",

Due to an ageing population, the incidence is increasing. Basic research has made huge progress in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the disease, the immune system, and the tumor microenvironment, which has translated into the manufacture of revolutionary immunotherapies such as immunomodulatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy. Dendritic vaccines (before and after autologous stem cell transplant [ASCT]) are starting to show promising results in high-risk patients [3]. However, this increase in the choice of treatment coupled with the fact that MM patients are a highly heterogeneous group, presents a huge challenge to clinicians who lack robust guidelines to select the most appropriate treatment for a given patient. While there are currently some hot debates about some specific therapeutic approaches (eg. quadruplet induction versus triplet, early transplant versus no transplant, immunotherapies for earlier relapse or frontline treatment, etc.), this perspective review aims to discuss a few non-therapy-related key issues which we believe would represent a pre-requisite towards improving MM outcomes in the next few years.",
        "Knowledge from well-designed clinical trials must be combined with real-world (RW) data to improve therapeutic strategies and hence outcomes of MM patients everywhere. There may be great variation in prognostic patient and disease characteristics between clinical trial populations and RW cohorts, such differences may drive differences in outcomes. A large Canadian population-based cohort study has highlighted the significant efficacy-effectiveness gap between registrational randomized controlled trials and RW usage of treatment regimens, with MM patients treated in RW settings having death rates 75% higher than those in clinical trials [4]. Improvements in outcomes of patients with MM depend on the use of approved regimens; those based on efficacy results from large phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Such trials are the gold standard for treatment outcomes; however, they must be unbiased in design and paramount to this is the selection of appropriately assessed endpoints. Patient selection for RCTs is problematic as many RW patients will not meet the stringent trial inclusion criteria and so the effectiveness of treatments in the RW setting will be unknown [5].",
        "Frail and/or elderly patients are rarely included in clinical trials [6], thus the benefits are less clear-cut in this patient group. However, existing frailty scores including that of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) are problematic as they weigh age heavily, mis-categorizing the ‘fit elderly’ as frail [7]. Frailty prevalence varies greatly across trials ranging from 17 to 74% [7]. Not all frail people are old; are fit elderly patients the same as young frail patients? It is imperative that frail patients are identified more accurately with a standardized tool that is easy to use in the RW setting. A frailty score should encompass not only traditional clinical parameters but also the physical, psychological, and social aspects of a patient’s well-being. Frailty assessment tools must be easy to administer and although they are being increasingly incorporated into trial designs, there remains wide heterogeneity in the categorization and cut-off for frailty which will limit our ability to evaluate any associated outcomes. Recruitment of frail patients will allow a better understanding of treatment toxicity and determine if discontinuation is the real reason behind their poorer outcomes.",
        "In their frailty-adjusted therapy study in transplant non-eligible newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of recruiting older, less fit patients to clinical trials [8]. This phase III, multi-center, RCT investigated whether dose adjustments dependent on frailty would improve a patient’s ability to remain on therapy, reduce toxicity, and improve clinical outcomes. They showed that the IMWG frailty score demonstrated a dynamic biomarker potential both representing improved functionality in relation to disease response to therapy, as well as deterioration consequential to treatment-emergent toxicity. In addition, the concept of ultra-frail represents an opportunity to further stratify patients who may need additional support in order to improve their outcomes [8]. Further work in these two areas is needed. Dynamic frailty scoring would improve trial design as frailty is not a static concept, it may improve or deteriorate at each post diagnosis landmark interval. Frailty status at varying time points has also been shown to be a better predictor of outcomes than frailty status at time of diagnosis [9]. This limitation of evaluation of frailty-associated outcomes is an area that is largely unexplored and needs more attention.",
        "First-line therapy for MM is still largely based on the eligibility of patients to undergo ASCT rather than on the biological characteristics of the disease itself or the depth of response achieved during therapy. Prognostic factors detected both before and throughout treatment may enable a more precise prediction of MM patients’ outcome that would allow personalized approaches. Cumulative evidence from trials has confirmed the robust association of minimal residual disease (MRD) status and survival outcomes in MM and has highlighted the primary importance of MRD in guiding treatment decisions. It can be accepted that MRD negativity should be a new endpoint in MM therapy (in addition to the classical other endpoints such as PFS and OS), regardless of cytogenetic risk, depth of response at MRD assessment, and the time of MRD measurement (NDMM or relapsed/refractory disease, and before or after maintenance therapy initiation) [10]. Therefore, it is essential that trials adopt standardized methodologies to assess MRD at specific time points. An exploratory analysis of the ongoing POLLUX and CASTOR studies in relapsed/refractory patients, found that sustained MRD negativity (defined as the maintenance of MRD negativity in bone marrow confirmed ≥6 or ≥12 months apart) is associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with patients who obtain MRD-negative status but not MRD durability [11]. This supports the concept that sustained MRD negativity may serve as a surrogate end point for PFS in ongoing and future clinical trials.",
        "As a matter of fact, some uniformity is needed in how MRD is reported and at what threshold. Usually, MRD is measured at specific timepoints during therapy e.g., post-induction, +100 days post-ASCT, post-consolidation, pre-maintenance, and during maintenance. Data suggest that the duration of MRD negativity may be important, but little data are available on sustained MRD negativity (i.e., the need to confirm MRD at different timepoints) and on its optimal duration. Future trials should allow the exploration of different time cutoffs for sustained MRD negativity. In addition, one may wonder whether the sensitivity of the technique impact the reliability of MRD evaluation. The French IFM/DFCI 2009 trial [12] found that among 163 patients who were MRD-negative pre-maintenance using multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) with a sensitivity of 10−4, 84 (56%) were indeed MRD-positive using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a sensitivity of 10−6 (3-year PFS, 86 vs. 66% in NGS-negative vs. NGS-positive among MFC-negative patients). To avoid unacceptable risk of undertreatment, clinical trials exploring treatment interruption based on MRD levels must use techniques of adequate and high sensitivity.",
        "As a corollary, if MRD negativity is a major prognostic determinant, it would be important to question whether treatment administered and baseline risk stratification matter so long as MRD negativity is achieved. Regarding MM patients who are at high-risk according to baseline prognostic factors such as high-risk cytogenetics, MRD-negative patients evaluated at a low level of sensitivity (10−4) still showed inferior clinical outcomes compared with standard-risk patients. Conversely, achieving MRD negativity at a sensitivity of 10−5 to 10−6 has been shown to overcome the inferior outcome observed in high-risk vs. standard-risk patients. MRD-driven clinical trials are needed to determine if treatment de-escalation or deintensification in MRD-negative patients is feasible without impairing patient prognosis [13].",
        "Currently, there is no consensus on how or when to use the available ultrasensitive MRD assessment techniques for detecting and monitoring MRD status. Prospectively gathered clinical data will be useful in developing future paradigms for MRD analysis as a clinical practice decision tool. Future clinical trials must consider MRD negativity as an additional primary endpoint. Therefore, a second urgent need for the development and incorporation of MRD into clinical trials is in new drug development and registration. The development and approval of novel agents both for initial therapy and treatment of relapsed MM has already extended both PFS and overall survival (OS) several-fold. Therefore, at present, it is no longer possible to examine the impact of a novel agent to treat NDMM, alone or in combination, utilizing PFS and OS as endpoints, as these metrics would require clinical trials lasting well over a decade. Such a delayed determination of efficacy is unfair for patients and caregivers alike; moreover, it would slow drug development due to the prohibitive cost of such trials. There is therefore a crucial need for a parameter or surrogate marker, such as MRD, which can be examined earlier after treatment and predict subsequent PFS and OS. MRD negativity may not be an appropriate goal in all patient subsets (e.g., frail patients), but we may be able to inform the intensity or duration of therapy upon MRD status. Obviously, quality of life and patient-reported outcomes measurement can also be included in dynamic risk assessment, particularly in frail older patients where MRD may not always be a goal per se.",
        "More widespread incorporation of MRD into clinical trials will allow us to determine whether patients should receive consolidation therapy to achieve MRD or if the duration of maintenance therapy can be defined by MRD status. The recent positive opinion of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) of the FDA, is an important step in the right direction.",
        "It is critical to establish a definition of high-risk disease in order to move towards risk-adapted treatment approaches. Defining risk at diagnosis is important to both effectively design future clinical trials and guide which clinical data is needed in routine practice, but the definition of high-risk disease is a challenge [14]. High-risk MM at diagnosis is currently recognized according to the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) which was set up in 2015 [15] as a more accurate prognostic model for NDMM, incorporating ISS stage, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and high-risk cytogenetics assessed by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities defined as the presence of del(17p) and/or t(4;14) and/or t(14;16) or an elevated LDH above the upper limit of normal are risk factors that upstage patients in the R-ISS system. More recently, the “R2-ISS” revised the R-ISS by analyzing the additive value of each single risk feature, including chromosome 1q gain/amplification (1q+). This R2-ISS proved to be a simple prognostic staging system allowing a better stratification of patients with intermediate-risk newly-diagnosed MM [16]. Since then, an expert consensus was reached regarding the opportunity to revise the R-ISS including chromosome 1 abnormality by FISH, TP53 mutation or deletion by NGS, amount of circulating plasma cells by NGFC (next-generation flow cytometry), and multiple extramedullary plasmacytomas at PET-CT (positron emission tomography–computed tomography; H. Avet-Loiseau, personal communication). Clinicians are waiting for results of prospective trials that integrate high-risk features and MRD in the decision algorithm.",
        "Despite several validated risk stratification systems in clinical use, a uniform approach to risk in NDMM remains elusive. While we attempt to capture risk at diagnosis, the reality is that many important prognostic characteristics remain ill-defined, as some patients relapse early, while they were defined as low-risk based on their genomic profile at diagnosis. It is critical to establish a definition of high-risk disease in order to move towards risk-adapted treatment approaches. Current thinking is that defining risk at diagnosis is important to both effectively design future clinical trials and guide which clinical data is needed in routine practice [17, 18]. The International Myeloma Society (IMS) has worked recently on a consensus on genomic definition of high-risk MM. The panel considered (i) del17p (in more than 20% of sorted plasma cells), (ii) TP53 mut (with no threshold for VAF), (iii) del(1p32)del/del, (iv) t(4;14) or t(14;16) or t(14;20) + gain/amp 1q or del(1p32)del/wt, and (v) gain/amp 1q + del(1p32)del/wt as markers of high-risk MM (J. Corr, personal communication). The routine application of the latter definition is likely to impact the field significantly.",
        "MM patients of racial and ethnic minority are frequently underrepresented in clinical trials [19]. In the USA, it is estimated that approximately 20% of all patients with MM are of African American descent and yet, representation in clinical trials has historically been somewhere between 5 and 8%, and arguably even less in pivotal trials that have led to drug approval. There needs to be an understanding of the efficacy and [20] (eg. skin and nail toxicities in a black patient when using talquetamab) of these agents in different patient groups. For example, there are differences in the rates of cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicities in patients of African descent and in Hispanic American patients. Thus, clinical trial teams should ensure that the materials are designed to be able to be read by and supported by a diverse population, that health care providers are trained in understanding culturally sensitive care, and that teams should include a diversity officer [21].",
        "Recommendations on eliminating racial disparities in MM therapies have been made, including for pre- and post-approval of clinical trials, and relating to patient and industry perspectives [22, 23]. There is positivity related to the latter in that clinical trial sponsors are now aware of such recommendations. Ultimately, an improved understanding of disparities in MM should translate to clinical trial designs to help to guide appropriate treatment choices and ensure that there is equitable treatment for all.",
        "Supportive care is key component of optimal management of MM patients. The MM disease by itself is associated with a wide variety of debilitating complications, but also MM therapy is the source of many complications, including an increased risk of infection. All of these complications remain a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, more attention should be paid to these complications, and specific trials could focus on management of specific clinical situations (eg. prevention of infections, patients under dialysis, etc.) Vaccination is one of the most efficient methods to reduce morbidity and mortality. This is also true for MM. Screening for certain pathogens is recommended before starting and during aggressive therapies. Prophylactic medication with anti-virals, antibiotics, anti-fungals, immunoglobulin substitution can be recommended and should be validated in certain indications. In addition, adherence to high hygiene standards, including for example dietary recommendations, identifying, developing, and implementing evidence-based symptom management, or encouraging physical exercise, should be part of good clinical practice. The latter would likely improve patient QoL both in clinical trials and in routine practice.",
        "Furthermore, one must acknowledge that not all drugs are available in all countries and even in the developed ones, certain drugs may not be available [24, 25]. Pharmacoeconomic concerns are amplified in MM due to the need for multidrug regimens that combine two or more expensive new drugs, continuous therapy, and the prolonged disease course in most patients. The enormous costs of the combination of next-generation novel agents with immune antibody-based therapies must be addressed in order to assure access to these therapies for patients worldwide. First, trials should be able to identify drugs that work well in each subtype, but more importantly from a cost standpoint, we also need trials that can identify drugs that are unlikely to work in a given cytogenetic or risk subtype. Also, we need to determine whether an equivalent degree of survival benefit can be obtained with a short course of therapy compared with the current approach of prolonged therapy for many years. Approximately 15% of patients with NDMM can enjoy a long remission for a prolonged period of time with just lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or the latter combination plus ASCT [26, 27]. It is likely that with some modern combinations, a subset of patients can be identified who can do well for many years following around one year of initial therapy. Finally, we need to determine whether we can adjust therapy based on response, so that patients who have achieved MRD-negativity can safely stop therapy, thereby providing improved value and quality of life [28].",
        "The landscape of MM treatment is poised for transformation in 2024 and beyond. Embracing improved trial design, prioritizing patient-centric approaches, and fostering collaboration will be instrumental in achieving meaningful progress. By implementing the outlined action items, we can collectively propel MM research into a new era of innovation, ensuring that advancements translate into tangible improvements in patient outcomes.",

The key components of CAR‐T‐cell products are extracellular domains for tumour antigen recognition, such as CD19, CD20, CD22 and B‐cell maturation antigen, and intracellular costimulatory domains, such as 4‐1BB and CD28, which are crucial for T‐cell activation. These modified CAR‐T cells are infused into the patient's body following the lymphodepleting conditional regimen, with sustained lethality to the tumour through the patient's immune system.",
        "Worldwide clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of CAR‐T‐cell therapy in both relapsed/refractory (R/R) haematologic malignancies and solid tumours.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n However, CAR‐T‐cell therapy is also linked to a series of toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell‐associated neurotoxicity syndrome and B‐cell aplasia, which have drawn much attention and are largely reported to be attributed to unique adverse events different from those associated with standard chemotherapy.\n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n Previous studies have reported a high incidence of haematologic toxicity (HT), including neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia, after CAR‐T‐cell therapy, with biphasic characteristics.\n5\n, \n8\n, \n9\n Cytopenia due to CAR‐T‐cell therapy is classified according to occurrence and duration into early and prolonged haematologic toxicity (PHT).\n5\n Although the definition of PHT varies in research, the majority of studies define PHT as unresolved grade 3/4 cytopenia (according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) at Day 28 after CAR‐T‐cell therapy. Importantly, early HT is considered to be common and expected due to the myelotoxic effect of lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to CAR‐T‐cell infusion, with an incidence greater than 90%.\n5\n In the long‐term follow‐up of the ZUMA‐1 study, 17% of patients developed PHT (grade 3 or worse cytopenia) after 3 months.\n8\n Moreover, nearly 11% of patients did not achieve haematopoietic recovery at 12 months after CAR‐T‐cell infusion.\n10",
        "PHT actually exceeds the expectations of chemotherapy and continues for a long time after resolution of CRS. Of note, PHT and delayed haematopoietic recovery may result in an increased frequencies of infection, haemorrhagic events, blood product transfusions and prolonged hospitalization, which usually contribute to decreased quality of life, treatment‐related morbidity and mortality.\n11\n, \n12\n However, the mechanism of PHT is not yet clear and needs to be investigated. Here, we systematically summarize the current literature regarding PHT after CAR‐T‐cell therapy and present recommendations for its prevention and treatment.",
        "A narrative review was performed using the PubMed database (censored April 2023) with the following search terms: CAR‐T, chimeric antigen receptor, HT, neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and cytopenia.",
        "We retrieved 34 studies that specifically investigate rates of PHT in patients undergoing CAR‐T therapy, though the definitions of prolongation and severity of cytopenia varied (Table S1). Overall, all studies defined PHT according to the time of occurrence, except for Kato's study, which was based on the duration of PHT.\n13\n Fried et al. defined PHT as any grade of neutropenia, anaemia or thrombocytopenia on Day 21 after CAR‐T‐cell infusion and found that more than 90% of patients experienced prolonged cytopenia\n5\n; the incidence of PHT decreased to 78.9% on Day 28 in the Wang cohort\n14\n and to 66.7% in the Kitamura study.\n15\n The standard for the severity of PHT in most studies is unresolved grade 3/4 cytopenia. Under this standard of severity, eight studies analysed the cumulative incidence on Day 28,\n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n two studies on Day 29,\n24\n, \n25\n 10 studies on Day 30,\n26\n, \n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n, \n34\n, \n35\n one study on Day 35,\n36\n one study on Day 42\n37\n and three studies on Day 90\n8\n, \n38\n, \n39\n after CAR‐T‐cell infusion. In general, the rate of grade 3 or worse cytopenia ranged from 20% to 77.8% on Day 28 to Day 35 after CAR‐T‐cell infusion,\n18\n, \n30\n and differences in the incidence of PHT were ascribed to heterogeneity in the populations, CAR‐T cells used and diseases treated. As noted, the incidence of PHT declined to approximately 20% after 90 days.\n8",
        "Some studies also reported specific rates of blood lineage reduction after CAR‐T‐cell therapy. Rates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurring on Day 30 after CAR‐T‐cell therapy were 38.71%, 29%, 25% and 32%, compared to 22.58%, 16%, 7% and 7% for corresponding anaemia and 59.14%, 42%, 18% and 10% for thrombocytopenia, respectively.\n26\n, \n28\n, \n31\n, \n32\n Furthermore, it has been reported that the median time to recovery to grade 2 or lower for prolonged thrombocytopenia is 2.1 (range 1.2–13.8) months, longer than prolonged neutropenia recovery, at 1.9 (range 1.2–5.6) months.\n34\n The same results were obtained in Abramson's study, which showed that 37% (100/269) of patients experienced PHT on Day 29; among them, 84% (36/43), 82% (9/11) and 62% (36/58) of cases recovered to grade 2 or lower neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia by Day 90, respectively; the rate of haematopoietic recovery increased to 93% (40/43), 91% (10/11) and 74% (43/58) by Day 180, respectively.\n25\n It is worth noting that neutropenia is more likely to occur after Day 30 after infusion, followed by thrombocytopenia and anaemia; however, thrombocytopenia is maintained for a longer time and is simultaneously more difficult to reverse. Overall, the majority of cases with grade 3 or worse prolonged cytopenia recovered to grade 2 or better by Day 90 after CAR‐T‐cell infusion.\n22\n, \n36\n According to the literature, PHT is common but reversible.",
        "Seven of the previously mentioned studies investigated factors associated with increased risk of PHT among their cohorts. Fried et al. found that prior haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and higher CRS grade correlated positively with late cytopenia on Day 21; synchronous changes in C‐X‐C motif ligand 12 (CXCL12) and late neutropenia were observed post CAR‐T therapy.\n5\n Based on univariate analysis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1, >3 prior therapies and low absolute lymphocyte count were related to Day 30 grade 3–4 cytopenia in the Strati cohort.\n28\n Juluri et al. used the debiased least absolute shrinkage and selection operator for high‐dimensional linear regression modelling and identified that CRS severity was predictive of Day 28 platelet count and prelymphodepleting platelet count and that the transforming growth factor beta‐1 level was a protective factor for both Day 28 absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count.\n40\n Li et al. used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models of baseline characteristics, serum cytokine levels and CAR‐T‐cell therapy‐associated factors and identified interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) and severe HT after lymphodepleting chemotherapy as independent risk factors for PHT on Day 28 after infusion.\n41\n Similarly, Wang et al. found that cytokine profiles were independent risk factors for PHT; specifically, multivariate analysis determined high maximum interleukin‐10 (IL‐10) and IL‐17A levels as independent risk factors for prolonged neutropenia, high maximum IL‐6 for prolonged anaemia and high IL‐2 baseline levels as protective factors for prolonged thrombocytopenia.\n26\n Moreover, CAR‐HEMATOTOX, a model for CAR‐T cells related to HT in patients with lymphoma, comprises markers of haematopoietic reserve (baseline platelet count, haemoglobin and ANC) and baseline inflammation (C‐reactive protein [CRP] and ferritin), which can predict a longer duration of neutropenia.\n9\n Similarly, Nagle et al. confirmed the association between peak ferritin and CRP levels in combination with CRS and development of PHT by univariate analysis.\n27\n Factors related to PHT are shown in Table 1.",

        "To date, several studies have attempted to identify factors contributing to PHT, such as prechemotherapy regimens, severe CRS and baseline haematopoietic function.\n5\n, \n42\n However, the underlying mechanisms of PHT after CAR‐T‐cell therapy remain unclear.",
        "Kitamura et al. were the first to study changes between the bone marrow (BM) niche before and after CAR‐T‐cell infusion and its relationship with PHT, reporting that PHT patients tended to have a lower area proportion of CD271+ cells, which are proposed as numbers of HSPC niches, lower levels of CXCL12 and SCF in BM before CAR‐T‐cell infusion, and increased inflammation‐related cytokine levels of IL‐6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1 in BM.\n15\n In addition, higher levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and macrophage‐derived chemokines have been detected in patients with complete haematopoietic recovery,\n10\n revealing the mechanism of PHT from the BM microenvironment perspective. Furthermore, patients with PHT showed hypoplastic, as confirmed by BM biopsies in the Nagle cohort,\n27\n resembling BM manifestations of acquired aplastic anaemia (AA). Immune‐mediated disruption of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a partial mechanism of acquired AA. Strati et al. observed delayed reconstitution of CD4+ T cells in three of nine (33%) patients with PHT at 1 year and two of seven (29%) at 2 years; persistent grade 3–4 cytopenia occurred in 27% (4/15) at 1 year and 11% (1/9) at 2 years, indicating that immune reconstitution was delayed compared with haematopoietic recovery.\n28\n All this evidence demonstrates that imbalanced immune homeostasis and BM failure contribute to development of PHT after CAR‐T‐cell therapy.",
        "The occurrence of clonal haematopoiesis or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) may contribute to PHT development, especially in patients who receive multiple cytotoxic therapies prior to CAR‐T‐cell infusion.\n8\n, \n43\n Nahas et al. reported that two of eight patients with severe neutropenia at 42 days after CAR‐T‐cell infusion displayed definitive evidence of MDS characteristics (one with 7q‐ and excess blasts and another with 20q‐ and multilineage dysplasia).\n44\n In the study by Strati et al. three of 15 patients with PHT were diagnosed with MDS, with a median time to onset of 13.5 (range 4–26) months.\n28\n Kochenderfer et al. reported one of seven cases of complete remission of DLBCL with new cytopenia at 39 months after anti‐CD19 CAR‐T‐cell therapy diagnosed as MDS.\n45\n Unfortunately, information about clonal haematopoiesis‐related MDS prior to CAR‐T‐cell infusion is lacking for these cohorts. However, Cordeiro et al. found that two of four patients with a subsequent diagnosis of MDS had cytogenetic abnormalities before receiving CAR‐T‐cell therapy (one harboured t[10;13], and the other del5q).\n43\n What drives the occurrence of MDS? It has been reported that secondary MDS following ASCT is associated with previous exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylating agents.\n46\n Many patients have received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide as lymphodepleting chemotherapy before CAR‐T‐cell infusion, which may increase the risk of developing MDS. In addition, the possibility that CAR‐T‐cell treatment itself may lead to the occurrence of MDS cannot be excluded. Recently, a case report described a patient diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia after CAR‐T‐cell therapy. DNMT3A and PPM1D mutations already existed before treatment, but with newly acquired RUNX1 mutation.\n47\n Accorsi Buttini et al. also reported that one patient with R/R DLBCL based on sustained CSF3R and CEBPA mutations developed secondary MDS and acquired a new RUNX1 mutation after CAR‐T‐cell therapy.\n48\n These two cases suggest that CAR‐T‐cell treatment is similar to a double hit to promote development of MDS for those who already have clonal haematopoiesis prior to CAR‐T‐cell therapy. Conversely, Zhao et al. reported an incidence of therapy‐related myeloid neoplasms after CAR‐T‐cell therapy of 3.2%, comparable to that in patients who received chemotherapy or HSCT; hence, they deemed that CAR‐T‐cell infusion did not significantly increase the risk of therapy‐related myeloid neoplasms according to the current data for incidence.\n49\n Moreover, there was no significant difference in the incidence of MDS between patients with and without PHT from ZUMA‐1 and ZUMA‐9 in the Strati cohort (3/15 [20%] vs. 1/16 [6%], p = 0.33).\n28\n Briefly, whether CAR T cells themselves participate in the secondary MDS is controversial. Further research is needed for better comprehension of the pathophysiology of MDS post CAR‐T‐cell therapy.",
        "Another possible reason for the emergence of PHT may be inflammation due to CAR‐T‐cell therapy. Several studies have linked PHT to high‐grade CRS, inflammation markers (i.e. ferritin and CRP), and tocilizumab or steroid treatment,\n5\n, \n27\n, \n44\n which all indicate that patients with a greater degree of inflammation are more likely to experience PHT. Notably, some studies have discovered an association between cytokines and prolonged cytopenia.\n15\n, \n26\n, \n40\n, \n41\n These cytokines not only have proinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties but also different functions in haematopoiesis. IL‐2, a lymphocyte‐specific growth factor, plays a critical role in maintaining erythropoiesis by modulating Treg activity in BM,\n50\n, \n51\n which may explain the protective effect of IL‐2 against PHT. IL‐6 is a robust proinflammatory cytokine that participates in immune and inflammatory responses.\n52\n The latest research demonstrates the prominent role of IL‐6 in haematopoietic ageing. IL‐6 is upregulated in the aged microenvironment and is associated with decreased functionality of erythroid progenitor populations, which can be alleviated by IL‐6 inhibition,\n53\n and IL‐6 can promote emergency granulopoiesis and differentiation of the monocyte–macrophage lineage in response to inflammatory stimulation.\n54\n IL‐10 is an anti‐inflammatory cytokine and can trigger emergency myelopoiesis.\n55\n Recent research discovered that the level of IL‐10 was increased in the spleen, serum and BM in a benzene‐induced HT mouse model, implying a damaging effect of IL‐10 on haematopoiesis.\n56\n IFN‐γ can active quiescent HSCs in response to chronic infection and thus may exhaust them, resembling the manifestation of AA.\n57\n, \n58\n, \n59\n These imbalanced cytokines indirectly suppress haematopoiesis.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates several potential mechanisms of PHT after CAR‐T‐cell therapy. First, the BM microenvironment is impaired, with decreased secretion of haematopoietic support factors and increased secretion of proinflammatory factors. Second, cytokines secreted by CAR‐T cells have direct or indirect impacts on HSCs self‐renewal and quiescence. Third, imbalanced cytokines might contribute to superior differentiation of a single lineage. Fourth, high‐strength chemotherapy prior to CAR‐T‐cell infusion can directly impair the proliferative capacity of HSCs or lead to clonal haematopoiesis, with insufficient baseline haematopoietic function, hypocellular BM or MDS after infusion.",
        "Potential mechanism of prolonged haematologic toxicity after CAR‐T cell therapy. CXCL12, C‐X‐C motif chemokine ligand 12; HPSCs, human pluripotent stem cells; HSCs, haematopoietic stem cells; IFN‐γ, interferon‐γ; IL, interleukin; MCP‐1, monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1; NO, nitric oxide; SCF, stem cell factor; TNF‐α, tumour necrosis factor‐alpha.",
        "As mentioned above, baseline characteristics cannot be corrected. In light of the high grade of CRS associated with prolonged cytopenia, some studies have focused on reducing the severity of CRS and have shown that prophylactic or early use of prednisone and tocilizumab might be a promising strategy to prevent the occurrence of high‐grade CRS while not affecting CAR‐T‐cell efficacy.\n60\n, \n61\n, \n62\n, \n63\n Unfortunately, these studies have not reported information regarding the incidence of PHT.",
        "In addition to symptomatic supportive treatment, such as red blood cell transfusion and platelet transfusion, granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF) is the main and common therapeutic method for severe cytopenia. Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer clinical practice panels recommend that G‐CSF should be administered for persistent neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 109/L) on Day 28 after CAR‐T‐cell infusion and not proposed for use until there is no longer a risk of CRS (usually 2 weeks).\n64",
        "Previous studies have demonstrated that prednisone has a bidirectional regulatory effect on the immune system. On the contrary, prednisone can inhibit the proinflammatory cytokine production induced by epithelial cells, dendritic cells and macrophages and cytotoxic immune responses by increasing IFN‐γ expression. On the contrary, prednisone can enhance T‐cell activation, which leads to active efficient T cells, generation of follicular helper T cells and production of antibodies by B cells.\n65\n Moreover, prednisone can reduce apoptosis in erythroid progenitor cells and promote their survival in Diamond–Blackfan anaemia.\n66\n In terms of the role of prednisone in stimulating BM haematopoiesis, it was used as treatment for PHT in the Wang cohort. Seventeen patients who developed PHT and for whom erythropoietin, platelet receptor agonists, transfusion, or G‐CSF previously failed received low‐dose prednisone (at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg/day); all patients achieved haematologic recovery with a median response time of 21 (range 7–40) days. In addition, the side effects induced by prednisone, such as hypertension and hyperglycaemia, were alleviated with symptomatic treatment.\n14\n Although there is no definitive evidence for the mechanism by which prednisone alleviates PHT after CAR‐T‐cell therapy, small doses are safe and effective for PHT.",
        "Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant that inhibits antigen‐induced T‐ and B‐cell proliferation and antibody production. Previous studies have verified that sirolimus is a promising treatment choice for patients with autoimmune hemocytopenia, such as AA, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and pure red cell AA.\n67\n, \n68\n, \n69\n One case report described a patient who experienced prolonged severe cytopenia with active bleeding after CAR‐T‐cell therapy, with no response to dexamethasone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO), eltrombopag or avatrombopag, and eventually achieved complete haematopoietic recovery after administration of sirolimus.\n70\n Given the single case, more clinical studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of sirolimus in treatment of PHT after CAR‐T‐cell therapy.",
        "Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO‐RAs) are used for treatment of ITP, AA, chemotherapy‐induced thrombocytopenia and thrombocytopenia post stem cell transplantation.\n71\n, \n72\n, \n73\n, \n74\n TPO‐RAs bind to MPL (also known as TPO receptor), leading to its conformational change and activating a wide range of downstream signalling pathways, such as JAK2/STAT3/5, ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt, and ultimately increasing megakaryocyte differentiation and maturation and platelet production.\n75\n, \n76\n Furthermore, as the TPO receptor is expressed on stem cells, these agents have a critical role in stem cell proliferation and maintenance.\n77\n Eltrombopag, romiplostim and rhTPO are all TPO‐RAs and bind to MPL, activating similar signalling pathways. However, they differ in action region, degradation metabolic pathways, duration of action and metal chelation mechanisms, which may lead to synergistic effects when used together. Du et al. reported one patient who developed isolated thrombocytopenia at 15 months after CAR‐T‐cell infusion, with a high TPO concentration level and platelet autoantibody positivity. This patient had no response to platelet infusions, IVIG or IL‐11, but the combination therapy of rhTPO and eltrombopag was effective.\n78\n A case series of four patients who developed PHT in the Nagle cohort received eltrombopag at daily dosages from 50 to 150 mg; surprisingly, all four patients achieved haematologic recovery, with a median of 123 (range 41–145) days.\n27\n Moreover, six patients with prolonged cytopenia in the Beyar‐Katz cohort were administered TPO‐RAs (eltrombopag, n = 4; romiplastim, n = 1, both drugs, n = 1), which resulted in sustained haematologic responses.\n79\n Drillet et al. reported that 10 of 11 patients with prolonged thrombocytopenia treated with TPO‐RAs achieved platelet recovery (PLT >50 × 109/L) after a median time of 46 days.\n80\n Notably, all PHT patients in the Sarah and Beyar‐Katz cohorts showed hypocellular or aplastic marrow prior to TPO‐RAs treatment, indicating at least partial overlap with AA with regard to pathogenesis. However, more clinical studies are needed to explore the mechanism and efficacy of TPO‐RAs for PHT after CAR‐T‐cell therapy.",
        "Haematopoietic stem cell boost (HSCB), either as consolidation treatment or to treat prolonged cytopenia, has been performed in patients who had a complete response or complete response with incomplete haematologic recovery. HSCBs are categorized according to the source of stem cells into autologous (auto) and transplant donor derived (allogeneic; allo). In two case reports, auto‐HSCB reversed CAR‐T‐cell‐mediated prolonged pancytopenia in lymphoma and multiple myeloma patients.\n81\n, \n82\n Similarly, allo‐HSCB improved the prognosis of two B‐ALL patients with prolonged cytopenia and infection following CAR‐T‐cell therapy.\n83\n, \n84\n In addition to case reports, a multicentre study reported results for 31 patients receiving HSCB (auto, n = 30; allo, n = 1) for sustained severe and moderate neutropenia. A total of 84% (26/31) of patients achieved neutrophil recovery or improvement.\n85\n Another study reported that four of seven patients with PHT following CAR‐T‐cell therapy responded to allo‐HSCB, with two achieving complete haematologic recovery at the last follow‐up.\n86\n All patients in the above studies developed prolonged cytopenia after receiving BM aspirate before HSCB and had a considerably hypocellular marrow. Although use of HSCBs has been reported in small series, it has been indicated that HSCBs are suitable for hypocellular marrow, highlighting the safety and efficacy of HSCBs in patients with severe prolonged cytopenia following CAR‐T‐cell therapy.",
        "Given that the majority of patients with secondary MDS after CAR‐T‐cell therapy are not candidates for allo‐HSCT due to donor availability and individual status, hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are likely to become a potential treatment strategy. Klimek et al. reported that HMAs show comparable activity in therapy‐related MDS (38% overall response rate) as in de novo MDS.\n87\n Two studies have reported HMAs application in secondary MDS after CAR‐T‐cell therapy. One study reported that one patient achieved transient haematologic improvement after three cycles of azacytidine; unfortunately, she died due to recurrent pancytopenia.\n49\n In the other study, two patients received azacytidine and decitabine. Although the MDS outcome is not available, they maintained ongoing complete response for primary disease and were still alive at the last follow‐up.\n43\n The efficacy of HMA in PHT after CAR‐T‐cell therapy needs to be further investigated.",
        "Owing to the limited reports on the overall survival (OS) of PHT and non‐PHT patients after CAR‐T‐cell therapy, only two studies with available data for R/R MM patients who received CAR‐T cells were obtained by Engauge Digitize software version 4.1. Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software version 9.0. The results showed that PHT patients had worse prognosis, with an estimated 3‐year OS of 66.5% compared to 41.5% in non‐PHT patients (p < 0.001) (Figure 2).",
        "Overall survival were compared between MM patients with PHT and non‐PHT by Kaplan–Meier curves. Two‐sided p values were calculated based on the log‐rank test. PHT, prolonged haematological toxicity.",
        "With rapid commercialization of CAR‐T‐cell therapy, a growing number of clinical trials have reported PHT development. The majority of PHT cases seem to resolve by 3 months after CAR‐T‐cell infusion. Nevertheless, persistent and incorrigible cytopenia or late‐onset cytopenia has occurred in a small number of patients. The aetiology of prolonged cytopenia is unclear, and the various hypotheses and related factors proposed in various prediction models are not consistent, which makes it difficult to implement precise clinical intervention.",
        "In general, the damaged BM microenvironment and HSCs, clonal haematopoiesis prior to CAR‐T‐cell therapy, and the influence of imbalanced cytokines on haematopoiesis are involved in the pathogenesis of PHT. Previous studies have demonstrated that PHT is associated with increased risk of infection, longer hospitalization and poor prognosis after CAR‐T‐cell infusion. Therefore, early clinical treatment plays a crucial role in management of PHT. As noted, BM biopsy is recommended to rule out secondary myeloid malignancies such as MDS, especially for those with persistent severe cytopenia lasting more than 1 month or extremely late‐onset cytopenia.",
        "American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend that G‐CSF and prednisone may be used in cases with PHT not related to MDS, but there is no mention of the time or dosage of use. Although PHT is confronted with clinical challenges as a result of a lack of guidelines for management, attempts to use TPO‐RAs in PHT patients have achieved surprising efficacy. Nevertheless, long‐term efficacy and safety are unknown. Owing to the possibility of TPO‐RAs promoting clonal haematopoiesis, TPO‐RAs should be discontinued for PHT patients who do not respond after 3 months of treatment. In addition, reports on application of HSCB in treatment of PHT are gradually increasing. We propose that stem cells from a prior autologous or an allogeneic donor be persevered for those with a high risk of developing PHT, such that patients who achieve complete response will be accepted for HSCB for subsequent rescue in the event of prolonged cytopenia.",
        "Ultimately, there are some weaknesses in this article. The majority of listed studies only reported the incidence of PHT and were inconsistent in the definition of endpoint duration and differed in recommended management, with a lack of comprehensive management guidelines. Therefore, prospective studies are required, and the relevant mechanism of PHT should be explored in clinical trials. Once the pathophysiology of PHT is better understood, precise treatment strategies may emerge. It is anticipated that potential late HT will be overcome in the future with exponential application of CAR‐T cells and a deepened understanding of PHT.",

        "Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy targeting the CD-19 B-cell receptor has emerged as an efficacious and life-extending treatment modality with high response rates and durable remissions in patients with relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) [1], follicular lymphoma [2], and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) [3]. CAR-T cells targeting the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) in multiple myeloma (MM) are now also approved for clinical use. Investigational CAR T-cells targeting the CD30 antigen in T-cell and Hodgkin lymphomas, as well as CAR-T cells directed to multiple other tumor types are also being utilized.",
        "The process of making CAR-T cell constructs involves isolating the patient’s T-cells or T-cells from an allogeneic donor source and using lentiviral or retroviral vectors to transfer genetic information to express new T-cell receptors that can identify a specific antigen on tumor cells while concurrently activating T-cells. These cells are then allowed to multiply in vitro (~14 days) and are eventually infused into lymphodepleted patients. These CAR-T cells grow and multiply in the patient and function to identify and perform targeted destruction of the tumor cells. The treatment is specific to the cancer cells with amplified T-cell cytotoxic responses as well as nonspecific release of cytokines which contribute to sustained and durable responses. Some off-target effects such as B cell aplasia after CD19 CAR-T cell therapy may occur, and this may predispose to infection and diminish response to vaccines, including the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [4]. In the case of allogeneic CAR-Ts, while they can be “off the shelf” from a healthy donor, they require genomic editing to avoid graft vs. host disease [5].",
        "The patients currently deemed appropriate for CAR-T therapies often have diseases which are refractory to or have relapsed after heavy pretreatment with conventional therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or stem cell transplantation), have limited next line of treatment options, and consequently have poor clinical outcomes, with median survival of usually less than a year. In these patients, CAR-T cell therapy can help achieve sustained response as shown in various pivotal trials that led to their FDA approval. Currently, the USA FDA has approved CAR-T cell therapy with tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) for pediatric ALL in children and young adults up to 25 years [6,7], axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) [1] and lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) [8] for relapsed and refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), axi-cel in relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma [9], brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel) for relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma and B-cell ALL in adults [10], and idecabtagene-vicleucel (ide-cel) [11] and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, both recognizing the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA).",
        "Emergence of this form of adoptive immunotherapy has resulted in improved response rates in relapsed and refractory B-cell malignancies, but at the same time, it presents unique toxicities [1,2,3]. With emphasis on cytokine release syndrome (CRS), macrophage activation syndromes (MAS), and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), understanding the pathophysiology of these side-effects has been extensively examined but is still incompletely understood. While these can sometimes be life-threatening, they usually present early in the course of treatment, are well studied, and thus with appropriate management can be mitigated, thus making CAR-T cell therapy a safe treatment modality with low mortality rates [1,8,11]. With long term follow up of these patients, hematotoxicity (anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia) has emerged as an adverse effect of CAR-T cell therapy. This late recovery of cell counts has been largely under-recognized and under-reported, as most of the pivotal trials of CAR-T cell therapies focused on the survival benefits and acute toxicities and early cytopenia related to the lymphodepletion therapy; often cyclophosphamide and fludarabine [9,12,13].",
        "Other immune modulating therapies have previously been shown to be associated with late-onset neutropenia, especially anti-CD20 antibodies such as rituximab [14,15,16,17]. In this case, the neutropenia is thought to be due to aberrant B-cell reconstitution and possible formation of anti-neutrophil or anti-neutrophil precursor autoantibodies [17,18]. It often occurs two to six months after therapy and can be associated with neutropenic fever. There is also evidence for growth factor expression alterations such as in stromal derived factor-1 and BAFF (B cell activating factor) which may also alter myelopoiesis after rituximab [18], and late onset neutropenia seems more associated with various Fc receptor polymorphisms [19]. The incidence of late onset neutropenia is similar after obinutuzumab as compared to after rituximab [20]. Rituximab-induced neutropenia is usually self-limited and responds to granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) [15]. As CAR-Ts are also B-cell depleting, it is uncertain if some of the mechanisms leading to neutropenia might be similar to those operative in the case of rituximab. In the case of neutropenia after autologous stem cell transplantation, in the absence of poor engraftment due to inadequate stem cell numbers, late onset neutropenia is rare, but has often been associated with rituximab used prior to the conditioning chemotherapy as well [21]. In those who have received CAR-T therapy, the cumulative effect of prior anti-CD20 therapy on persistent cytopenia after Day+90 was not found to be statistically significant in a case series where the number of rituximab doses ranged from 2 to 19 [22].",
        "Cytopenias after infusion of CAR-T cells are exceedingly common and are biphasic or even triphasic in nature, the first phase occurring early within 3–4 weeks. In most cases [23,24], this early cytopenia is attributed to the lymphodepletion regimens, bridging chemotherapy or radiotherapy before CAR-T infusion, severe CRS, or MAS. These toxicities are responsible for an initial acute phase of the cytopenia and are managed with transfusion support, steroids, and tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 antibody.",
        "Prolonged or recurrent cytopenias have been increasingly reported at varying rates. In a long term follow up study of patients who had received CAR-T therapies with ongoing complete responses, sixteen percent experienced prolonged cytopenia in the absence of myelodysplasia (MDS) [25]. In a study from Hockings et al. [23] with axi-cel in 38 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients (with 28 DLBCL, 14 transformed follicular lymphoma, and 1 primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma), persistent grade 3/4 neutropenia by the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) at day 28 after CAR-T infusion was reported in 43% of patients. This was more common in patients who had received greater than or equal to four previous lines of therapy and was independent of CRS severity. Similar findings were noted in 38 patients (ALL and NHL) treated with CD-19 directed CAR-T therapy with neutropenia noted in 62%, thrombocytopenia in 44%, and anemia in 17% of patients at 6 weeks post CAR-T cell infusion [25]. Similarly, in the recent post hoc analysis of ZUMA-1 (NCT02348216, N = 24) and ZUMA-9 (NCT03153462, N = 7) [26], using axicabtagene ciloleucel for relapsed-refractory large B cell lymphoma, grade 3–4 cytopenias at day 30 were observed in 48% of patients (29% neutropenia, 16% anemia, and 42% thrombocytopenia), with persistent grade 3–4 cytopenia in 27% at 1 year and 11% at 2 years. In this study, four patients were diagnosed with MDS after a median of 13.5 months (range 4–26 months), attributed to previous systemic therapies. In the TRANSCEND NHL-001 (N = 269) study, which evaluated the role of lisocabtagene maraleucel in relapsed-refractory large B-cell lymphoma, prolonged cytopenia (defined as ≥ grade 3, not resolved at day 29) was reported in 37% of patients [8]. In a study of 83 patients treated with axi-cel or tisa-cel or BCMA directed CAR T-cells for myeloma, cell recovery at one month was 61%, 51%, 33%, and 28% for hemoglobin, platelets, neutrophils, and WBCs, respectively. At 3 months, similar rates of count recovery were 93%, 90%, 80%, and 59%, respectively. After adjustment for baseline cytopenia and CAR construct, CRS and ICANS of grade ≥3 was associated with absence of complete count recovery at 1 month [27]. Overall, these clinical observations cannot be explained by the myelotoxic effect of the pre-treatment conditioning regimens alone given their timing and persistence. The outcomes of various studies as related to cytopenias are summarized in Table 1.",
        "The phenomenon of delayed cytopenia after CAR-T cell therapy is poorly understood with various hypotheses proposed. Factors being considered are number of previous lines of therapies, higher median age, poor bone-marrow reserve with baseline cytopenias, severity of CRS during the acute phase of treatment, roles of various inflammatory cytokines [32], high prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), and high baseline lactate dehydrogenase levels, possibly correlating with tumor burden. While all the above-mentioned factors may play a role in the pathogenesis, the attempts to predict and identify those at risk of this complication have produced contradictory associations [23,25,28,29].",
        "In an analysis evaluating the outcomes in 22 patients receiving axi-cel, the authors found thrombocytopenia (≤75,000/microL) prior to infusion and median time to maximum CRS of any grade of less than 1 day to be statistically significant for development of persistent cytopenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count or ANC <500/microL without growth factor, lasting for >6 weeks). The number of previous lines of therapy was statistically significant as a contributing variable [28].",
        "In another analysis, with aim to identify predictive biomarkers for hematotoxicity and neutropenia at day+60 as the primary end point, Rejeski [29] and colleagues in a multicenter, retrospective, real-world analysis looked into 258 patients receiving axi-cel or tisa-cel for relapsed-refractory large B-cell lymphoma and found a positive correlation between baseline thrombocytopenia and hyperferritinemia and day+60 cytopenia. Based on their findings they developed the CAR-HEMATOTOX model, which included markers associated with hematopoietic reserve (i.e., hemoglobin, platelet count, absolute neutrophil count) and baseline inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, and ferritin). Per their analysis, high CAR-HEMATOTOX scores resulted in a longer duration of neutropenia and a higher incidence of severe thrombocytopenia and anemia. Incidence and severity of CRS and ICANS, peak cytokine levels, and number of previous lines of treatment were not associated with prolonged cytopenia. They also used three clinical phenotypes to define neutrophil recovery, (1) quick recovery: sustained neutrophil recovery without a second dip below ANC < 1000 cells/microL; (2) intermittent recovery: neutrophil recovery with ANC > 1000 cells/microL followed by second dip with ANC < 1000 cells/microL after day+21; or (3) aplastic: severe neutropenia (ANC < 500 cells/microL) for ≥14 days). In their analysis, intermittent recovery was seen in about 50% of cases, whereas 25% developed quick recovery and 25% aplastic phenotype. This model was externally validated in two different independent patient cohorts in Europe and United States with sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 68% for prediction of severe neutropenia more than or less than 14 days. The authors identified the retrospective nature and heterogeneous cohorts with small sample size as the limitations of the study [29].",
        "CRS is contributed to by the CAR-T cells themselves, by bystander cells such as macrophages, and possibly by other cells of the tumor microenvironment. CRS is more severe with higher numbers of infused T-cells, higher tumor burden, and with use of CD28 as a co-stimulatory domain vs. those with 4-1BB constructs [33]. Myeloid-derived macrophages play a role in cytokine release syndrome through secretion of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and interferon-gamma IFN-γ. Macrophage activation also occurs in response to the CAR-T infusion [34]. Toll-like receptors and downstream nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-KB) are also involved. Thus, interleukins chemokines, interferons, angiogenesis factors, and others are all implicated in this syndrome, and many of these are myelosuppressive and can contribute to both early and later cytopenias [33].",
        "Role of CHIP (clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential) in cytopenias",
        "The effect of CHIP on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing CAR-T cell therapy was evaluated in a recent retrospective analysis of 154 patients with NHL and MM, with median age of the population at 63 years (range 24–83 years) and median number of prior lines of treatment at four. The presence of CHIP led to an improved clinical response in the younger population <60 years of age defined as higher likelihood to achieve complete response; 77.6% with CHIP vs. 57.9% without CHIP, p < 0.05%). CHIP was associated with higher grade (≥2) CRS [35]. This finding contrasts with the inferior outcomes conventionally reported in patients with CHIP and NHL or MM undergoing autologous transplantation [36,37]. It was postulated that CHIP may influence the inflammasome, and CHIP had no bearing on progression free and overall survival in either older or younger patients.",
        "Role of cytokines in cytopenias",
        "The role of cytokines in the development of prolonged cytopenias (beyond D+30) post-CAR-T infusion is controversial. In one study, an association between day 7 peak levels of INF-Ÿ, G-CSF, CXCL-1, IL-1β, CCL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and fms-like tyrosine (FLT-3) ligand and grade 3–4 cytopenias at day-30 after infusion was noted, and there was a correlation with low levels of epithelial growth factor (EGF) [24], emphasizing the effect of CAR-T cell activity rather than the myelosuppressive effect of conditioning regimens utilized. Low levels of stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), a chemokine responsible for B-cell development and trafficking of neutrophils as well as hematopoietic stem cells, were found to be associated with late onset cytopenia (after D+21) [25]. Wang et al. [30] found a 70% incidence of neutropenia, 53% severe anemia, and 48% severe thrombocytopenia in an analysis of 76 ALL patients. Neutropenia was associated with D-dimer levels and delayed peak time of CRS, anemia with delayed CRS recovery and elevated IL-10 levels, and maximum ferritin level was associated with thrombocytopenia. In general, a higher grade of CRS was associated with prolonged cytopenias. In another retrospective analysis of 173 patients, 9% had persistent neutropenia (D+28 post CAR-T infusion) and 14% prolonged thrombocytopenia after a CD19-targeted CAR-T construct utilized in a single institution study [31]. CRS severity was an independent variable for decreased platelet count, and lower pre-lymphodepletion platelet count was an independent predictor of both platelet count and neutrophil count suppression. In multivariable analysis, higher IL-6 levels were associated with lower day 28 counts, and higher concentrations of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta were associated with higher counts [31]. As hematologic toxicity seems to be a class effect seen with most CAR constructs, there is also an ongoing discussion if this is secondary to the expansion and persistence of CAR-T cells themselves [23] or could be due to the different costimulatory domains (CD-28 for axi-cel and brexu-cel and 4-1BB for tisa-cel and liso-cel) [38]. Other analyses have not found an association between CRS incidence and severity nor with peak cytokine levels and neutropenia to day+60 [28].",
        "Management of this clinical entity remains largely symptomatic with use of transfusion products and supportive care with colony stimulating factors. Use of the validated CAR-HEMATOTOX model can help in risk stratification for predicting early and late hematotoxicity [29]. Early initiation of prophylactic G-CSF [39] in high-risk patients after CRS has subsided, along with appropriate antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis, and close monitoring for any infectious complications are important. The use of granulocyte/macrophage growth factor in particular is not recommended for the first 2 to 3 weeks of therapy given concerns about exacerbating CRS. The possible role of inflammatory mediators in contributing to cytopenia has led some to recommend a trial of steroids for mitigation [40], and some have advocated use of anti-cytokine therapy such as anakinra or tocilizumab, although a role for these in prolonged cytopenias is uncertain. Although this remains to be studied further, high-risk patients may be triaged for autologous stem cell collection and cryopreservation for hematological rescue in the case of prolonged cytopenias after CAR-T infusion [41,42]. Those who have previously collected stem cells for autologous transplantation purposes could have these cryopreserved stem cells reinfused as a rescue. There is currently no general consensus regarding safe use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor and thrombopoietin-receptor agonists and, in general, for cytopenias lasting more than a month, marrow examination is recommended, as this can rule out involvement with the primary malignancy or with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia as a cause of cytopenias [43]. While prophylaxis against viruses and Pneumocytis jurovecii pneumonia (PJP) are recommended, there is no consensus about anti-bacterial prophylaxis or anti-fungal prophylaxis in late onset cytopenia cases [40,43]. The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation has now suggested antiviral and PJP prophylaxis from lymphodepletion until 1 year post-CAR-T infusion and until CD4 counts are >0.2 × 109/L. Granulocyte colony stimulating factors are to be avoided during early phases during times of increased risk of CRS and ICANS, but they can be used after Day+14 on an individualized basis. Anti-bacterial prophylaxis is per institutional guidelines, and intravenous immunoglobulin can be considered in adults with serious or recurrent infections and IgG levels <400 mg/dL [44].",
        "Cytopenias of grade 3 or higher and lasting more than one month after CAR T-cell infusion occur in 20–40% of patients [44]. In a series of “real-life” CAR-T therapy, cytopenia beyond 90 days was found in 33% of evaluable patients [45]. In the ZUMA-7 trial, where axi-cel was compared to high dose therapy and stem cell rescue, 29% of patients had prolonged cytopenias of grade 3 or higher after 30 days in the axi-cel arm compared with only 19% who received high-dose chemotherapy [46]. As it becomes increasingly recognized, late cytopenia after CAR-T cell therapy poses a clinical challenge in risk stratification, diagnosis, and management. The reporting of this late side effect has been inconsistent. The definition of prolonged/recurrent cytopenia is heterogeneous and arbitrary, with wide time ranges from D+14 up to D+90 being used as a framework for examination of the incidence of cytopenia. The mechanisms for these count depressions remain poorly understood with multiple proposed hypotheses and associated factors that have not been consistent among various predictive models, thereby making it a moving target for any clinical intervention. Figure 1 demonstrates some possible contributors to cytopenias post-CAR-T therapy. Table 2 illustrates an arbitrary breakdown of the timeframe of cytopenias with postulated mechanisms and proposed interventions. As noted, future work will be required to understand the incidence, causation, and ramifications of cytopenias at these various time points on the ultimate effectiveness of CAR-T therapies. It is also important to remember that cytopenias can be early and self-limited, intermittent, continuous, or with de novo late appearance [29].",
        "Cytopenias can negatively impact CAR-T therapy outcomes with increased infectious complications and increased utilization of medical resources, thereby adding cost to an already expensive treatment [47]. However, other studies have shown that with the exception of neutropenia, increase in duration of anemia or thrombocytopenia may be associated with improvement in progression-free survival. There is evidence that cytopenias after CAR-T therapy may not be associated with an effect on risk of disease relapse [48]. In a retrospective analysis, Lerman and colleagues examined whether complete vs. incomplete count recovery defined as an absolute neutrophil count >1000/micoL and platelets >100,000/microL affected relapse free survival or overall survival. There was no difference in relapse free survival when stratified by hematologic recovery, but overall survival was lower for those with incomplete count recovery. In a multivariable analysis which adjusted for gender, prior blinatumomab, number of relapses, disease burden at infusion, and maximum CRS grade, complete count recovery was not associated with overall survival with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (p = 0.2908) as compared to incomplete count recovery [48]. In addition to increasing morbidity and mortality, given that the majority of patients ultimately experience disease relapse, cytopenias compromise the ability to provide additional treatment post-relapse and may preclude participation in clinical trials. In a series from the Mayo system of patients who relapsed after CAR-T therapy, low blood counts were the most common barrier to participation in clinical trials [49].",
        "The American Society of Clinical Oncology has adopted guidelines which address management of post-CAR-T cytopenias and B-cell aplasia [40] as has the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation [44]. The role that prior therapies, baseline blood counts, type of lymphodepleting [50] or bridging therapy, CAR-T construct utilized, severity of CRS and ICANS, persistence of CAR-Ts after infusion, and other factors play in cytopenia incidence continue to be examined. Current reported studies are primarily retrospective, heterogeneous in terms of CAR-T used and disease treated, non-uniform in definitions of cytopenias and durations for end points and vary in terms of recommended management. Prospective studies will be required in the future, and correlative studies investigating the pathophysiology of prolonged cytopenias should be incorporated into clinical trials. It is anticipated that as more CAR-T constructs achieve widespread use, the incidence, pathogenesis, and management of related cytopenias will be further elucidated with the goal of overcoming this potential late toxicity of these cellular therapies.",

To date, all six CAR T cell products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are autologous and centrally manufactured. As the numbers of approved products and indications continue to grow, new strategies to increase cell-manufacturing capacity are urgently needed to ensure patient access. Distributed manufacturing at the point of care or at other local manufacturing sites would go a long way toward meeting the rising demand. To ensure successful implementation, it is imperative to harness novel technologies to achieve uniform product quality across geographically dispersed facilities. This includes the use of automated cell-production systems, in-line sensors and process simulation for enhanced quality control and efficient supply chain management. A comprehensive effort to understand the critical quality attributes of CAR T cells would enable better definition of widely attainable release criteria. To supplement oversight by national regulatory agencies, we recommend expansion of the role of accreditation bodies.

        "However, the application of CAR-NK cell monotherapy still faces numerous challenges, including intrinsic dysfunction and extrinsic suppression by the tumor microenvironment (TME).7 A CAR-NK cell-based combinatorial strategy may represent a promising therapeutic approach.8 T cells play a pivotal role in the adaptive immune system and can differentiate into memory phenotypes with robust regenerative capacity, providing continuous immune surveillance, and serving as an essential complement to NK cell-mediated responses.9 T cells help maintain the viability and cytotoxic potential of NK cells during tumor clearance and contribute to the formation of a “hot” TME.10 11 Furthermore, NK cells enhance T-cell immunity through both indirect and direct mechanisms.12 13 Therefore, novel CAR-NK cells capable of recruiting and cooperating with T cells may provide promising therapeutic opportunities.14 15",
        "Numerous studies have demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-15 is critical for the survival and cytotoxicity of NK cells and T cells.3 16 Chemokines such as C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 19 and CCL21 play key roles in directing the migration of T cells.17 18 Research has shown that CAR-T cells co-expressing CCL21 and IL-7 exhibit stronger tumor rejection compared with those co-expressing CCL19 and IL-7.17 Additionally, CCL21 holds potential for enhancing T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, as well as exerting anti-angiogenic effects.1921 Notably, higher plasma concentrations of CCL21 are associated with prolonged survival in patients with cancer, such as those with melanoma.22",
        "In this study, we designed a novel CAR-NK cell co-expressing IL-15 and CCL21 (15×21 CAR-NK), which enhances antitumor immunity by recruiting and collaborating with T cells in the TME.

Moreover, 15×21 CAR-NK cells displayed potent T-cell chemotactic activity and were able to synergize with T cells to alleviate mutual exhaustion phenotypes. Additionally, we observed that 15×21 CAR-NK cells significantly activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, a central regulator of cellular function and survival, associating with enhanced survival, apoptotic resistance, mitochondrial function, and cytotoxicity.

Moreover, in an IL-2-free culture environment, 15×21 CAR-NK cells show enhanced expansion and persistence compared with UTD NK cells (online supplemental figure 1E). To evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity and cytokine production capacities of these NK cells, they were co-cultured with CD19+ B-cell lymphoma (Raji, SU-DHL-2, Ramos, and Daudi), CD19− K562, and CD19-K562 cell lines (figure 1D). Both 15 CAR-NK and 15×21 CAR-NK cells demonstrated superior cytotoxicity over UTD NK and CAR-NK cells, irrespective of CD19 expression. After 24 hours of incubation with tumor cells, 15×21 CAR-NK cells exhibited the highest secretion levels of IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-2 (figure 1F). Notably, the significant secretion of IFN-γ and TNF-α by 15×21 CAR-NK cells was also independent of the tumor’s expression of CD19. We hypothesized that this enhanced cytotoxic function and inflammatory cytokine secretion may be mediated by cytokines (IL-15 and/or CCL21). Subsequently, we generated NK cells secreting IL-15 and/or CCL21—namely, 15 NK, 21 NK, and 15×21 NK—and evaluated the expression of effector molecules (CD107a, GZMB, perforin, IFN-γ, and Ki-67) as well as cytotoxicity across all NK cell types following co-culture with Raji cells. The results demonstrated that IL-15, CCL21, and the CAR construct each contributed to enhanced effector molecule expression and cytotoxic activity in NK cells (online supplemental figure 1F,G). Notably, 15×21 CAR-NK cells remained the most effective, exhibiting superior expression of effector molecules—particularly GZMB and CD107a—and greater cytotoxicity compared with 15 NK, 21 NK, 15×21 NK, and 15 CAR-NK cells. These results indicate that 15×21 CAR-NK cells display outstanding effector functions against both CD19+ and CD19− tumors in vitro.",
        "RNA-seq data analysis revealed that both 15×21 CAR-NK and 15 CAR-NK cells were enriched in several critical functional pathways (such as the NF-κB signaling pathway and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, online supplemental figure 1H) as well as immune regulation biological processes (online supplemental figure 2A), compared with CAR-NK cells. To further assess the T-cell recruitment potential of NK cells, we conducted transwell experiments. Activated T cells, expressing the corresponding receptors CCR7 and IL-15Rα for CCL21 and IL-15, respectively, were seeded in the upper chambers 72 hours after co-culture of NK and SU-DHL-2 cells in the bottom chambers (figure 2A,B). After 9 hours of migration, the 15×21 CAR-NK group exhibited a significantly higher number of T cells in the lower chamber compared with the other groups, while the 15 CAR-NK group did not show this effect (figure 2C,D).",
        "Distinct cytokine profiles of different NK cell types may also influence migrating T cells; therefore, we developed an additional chamber model to investigate the indirect modulation for T cells in the context of antitumor response, without direct contact. Activated T cells were seeded in the upper chambers with a pore size of 0.4 µm, following a 48-hour co-culture of NK cells and SU-DHL-2 cells in the lower chambers (figure 2E). After an additional 24-hour incubation, T cells in the 15×21 CAR-NK group showed a slightly lower proportion of CD8+ TEM cells compared with those in the UTD NK chambers (figure 2F and online supplemental figure 2B). Furthermore, T cells from both the 15 CAR-NK and 15×21 CAR-NK groups displayed less pronounced exhausted phenotypes (figure 2G,H). The 15×21 CAR-NK group displayed significantly lower percentages of CD8+ lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3)+T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT)+T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3)+ and CD8+TIGIT+TIM-3+ T cells compared with the 15 CAR-NK group (figure 2H). Additionally, we assessed the expression of effector molecules in T cells across different groups. We did not observe any significant differences in the expression of GZMB and IFN-γ among the four groups (figure 2I). These experiments suggest that 15×21 CAR-NK cells have remarkable recruitment potential and mild indirect modulation effects on T cells in the co-culture environment.",
        "To investigate the cooperative interactions and mutual direct modulation between 15×21 CAR-NK cells and T cells, we performed co-culture experiments in which Raji cells were incubated with either one or both cell types. During 5.5 hours of monitoring using the ImageXpress Micro Confocal system, we observed the independent clearance of cancer cells by 15×21 CAR-NK cells and T cells, respectively (figure 3A). As expected, the wells treated with both 15×21 CAR-NK and T cells contained fewer Raji cells (figure 3B). When combined with T cells to target Raji cells, the 15×21 CAR-NK cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxic activity compared with their UTD counterparts, as observed using NanoLive 3D Explorer (onlinesupplemental videos 1  2).",
        "We next analyzed the phenotypes and effector molecular expression of 15×21 CAR-NK cells and T cells in the context of their combination. The presence of 15×21 CAR-NK cells increased the percentages of CD4+ TCM and CD8+ TNaive cells, while decreasing the proportion of CD4+ TEFF (figure 3C). Exposure to 15×21 CAR-NK cells also attenuated T-cell activation and exhaustion phenotypes by significantly downregulating the levels of CD69 and LAG-3, with a trend toward decreased CD25, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and TIGIT expression (figure 3D).24 Similarly, the addition of T cells reduced the expression of the inhibitory receptor TIGIT, an immune checkpoint molecule that suppresses NK and T cell activity, on 15×21 CAR-NK cells (figure 3E). Among NK-cell natural membrane receptors, we observed an upregulation of the KIR3DL1 receptor (figure 3F). Additionally, the combination regimen against Raji cells did not affect the effector molecule levels in 15×21 CAR-NK cells (figure 3G), while significantly increasing the GZMB expression in T cells (figure 3H).",
        "Extending the co-culture time of 15×21 CAR-NK cells with tumor cells promoted the activation (CD25) of 15×21 CAR-NK cells and the upregulation of exhaustion markers (PD-1 and TIM-3, inhibitory receptors that suppress NK cell function, online supplemental figure 3A). We further investigated the effects of extended co-culture time (from 24 to 48 hours) and increased T-cell ratio (NK: Raji: T ratio from 5:5:1 to 1:1:1) on 15×21 CAR-NK cells and T cells. The proportion of CD8+ TEM cells was reduced, and the frequency of TIGIT+ 15×21 CAR-NK cells remained low (online supplemental figure 3B,C). Expression of CD57, NKG2C, and TRAIL on 15×21 CAR-NK cells continuously increased significantly, indicating that T cells can promote the expression of some activating receptors on 15×21 CAR-NK cells after sufficient exposure (online supplemental figure 3D). These findings reveal the potential of cooperative antitumor therapy with 15×21 CAR-NK cells and T cells, simultaneously alleviating mutual exhaustion phenotypes and promoting the effector molecular or activating receptor expression of both cell types.",
        "To further evaluate the in vivo recruitment of T cells and T-cell modulation efficacy of 15×21 CAR-NK cells, we first constructed a luc+ Raji-bearing abdominal mouse model. After 5 days of tumor inoculation, NK cells with IL-2 were injected intraperitoneally into M-NSG mice, and T cells were simultaneously administered via the tail vein (figure 4A). 5 days post-treatment, mice were sacrificed, and abdominal cavity lavage was collected for flow cytometry to determine T-cell migration and phenotypes. Results showed that the 15×21 CAR-NK group recruited a higher number of T cells to the tumor site (figure 4B). T cells in the CAR-NK, 15 CAR-NK, and 15×21 CAR-NK cell treatment groups exhibited reduced activation and exhaustion phenotypes, with CD69 and TIGIT expression significantly lower than those in the phosphate buffer saline (PBS) group (figure 4C). Additionally, T cells in the 15×21 CAR-NK group demonstrated a significant increase in GZMB expression compared with the PBS treatment group, and there was also a noticeable trend toward increased expression of perforin (figure 4D). According to in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) results, the 15×21 CAR-NK group demonstrated enhanced tumor suppression compared with the PBS group (online supplemental figure 4A). These findings suggest that 15×21 CAR-NK cells can efficiently recruit T cells, mitigate T-cell activation and exhaustion phenotypes, and enhance the expression of cytotoxic molecules in T cells within the mouse model.",
        "Subsequently, based on the in vivo T-cell recruitment capacity of 15×21 CAR-NK cells, a subcutaneous xenogeneic tumor model was used to assess the combined therapeutic potential of 15×21 CAR-NK and T cells. Seven regimens, including PBS, NK cell monotherapy (UTD NK, CAR-NK, 15 CAR-NK, and 15×21 CAR-NK), combination therapy (15×21 CAR-NK combined with T cells), and T-cell monotherapy, were administered 7 days after the inoculation of luc+ Raji cells, respectively (figure 4E). Among NK cell monotherapies, 15×21 CAR-NK cell therapy effectively controlled tumor progression compared with the PBS group, as assessed weekly by in vivo BLI and confirmed by tumor weight measurement on day 30, further validating the therapeutic efficacy of 15×21 CAR-NK cells in vivo (figure 4F–H). Additionally, 15×21 CAR-NK demonstrated a slight advantage in in vivo expansion compared with UTD NK, CAR-NK, and 15 CAR-NK, although this difference was not statistically significant (online supplemental figure 4B). Regarding combination therapies, treatment with 15×21 CAR-NK cells in combination with T cells resulted in superior tumor control compared with T-cell monotherapy (figure 4F–H). However, the difference compared with 15×21 CAR-NK cell monotherapy did not reach statistical significance. Importantly, none of the seven treatment groups caused any noticeable weight loss in mice (figure 4I).",
        "To further explore the potential synergistic effect, we established an additional subcutaneous tumor mouse model and administered two cycles of cell therapy (figure 4J). In this two-round treatment model, the combination of 15×21 CAR-NK and T-cell therapy demonstrated enhanced tumor control compared with either 15×21 CAR-NK or T-cell monotherapy (figure 4K–M). Moreover, this combination treatment prolonged mouse survival compared with the T-cell monotherapy group (figure 4N). The combination regimen exhibited a favorable safety profile, with no evidence of weight loss or off-target toxicity in major organs observed in mice (figure 4O,P). These results demonstrate that combining 15×21 CAR-NK cells with T cells for multiple cycles of treatment is both effective and safe, and superior to either 15×21 CAR-NK cell or T-cell monotherapy.",
        "To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the impact of CCL21 and IL-15 co-expression on the intrinsic function of 15×21 CAR-NK cells, we conducted a series of RNA-seq data analyses on four different NK cell types. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) indicated that the 15×21 CAR-NK cells were significantly enriched in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway compared with other NK cell types (figure 5A and online supplemental figure 5A). As CCL21 could induce the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and NK cells express the CCR7 receptor (online supplemental figure 5B), we hypothesized that the high GSVA score for PI3K/AKT/mTOR could be attributed to the secretion of CCL21.25 Data from human tissues, including peripheral blood, spleen, liver, and lung, all of which are rich in NK cells, from The Cancer Genome Atlas database supported this assumption by showing a positive correlation between CCL21 levels and the NK-cell PI3K/AKT/mTOR signature (figure 5B). In addition, exogenous CCL21 exposure could upregulate p-mTOR levels in NK cells during the first 4 hours of monitoring (figure 5C,D), suggesting the role of CCL21 in the induction of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.",
        "The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway can regulate pro-survival signaling.26 We performed a correlation analysis between the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and other hallmark pathways. Results demonstrated that a variety of cell survival-related pathways, such as DNA repair, G2M checkpoint, and MTORC1 signaling, showed significant positive correlations (figure 5E). Furthermore, significant enrichment of cell cycle and DNA repair biological processes in 15×21 CAR-NK cells, compared with UTD NK, CAR-NK, and 15 CAR-NK cells, was confirmed by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (figure 5F). It is noteworthy that continuous stimulation with IL-15 may result in compromised cell survival and gene expression patterns associated with cell cycle arrest.27 In this study, we found that GSVA scores for survival-related and growth-related pathways (such as DNA repair, E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, and MYC targets), as well as the expression of certain transcription factors (TFs) in the MYC and E2F families, were downregulated in 15 CAR-NK cells compared with CAR-NK cells (online supplemental figure 5A,C). In contrast, no such effect was observed in the 15×21 CAR-NK cell group. These data further demonstrate the survival advantage of 15×21 CAR-NK cells. Additionally, the growth advantage of 15×21 CAR-NK cells can be counteracted by rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, with a decrease in Ki-67 expression and BrdU incorporation (figure 5G,H). These results suggest that the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is associated with 15×21 CAR-NK cell survival, and that the growth advantage of 15×21 CAR-NK can be blocked by mTOR inhibition.",
        "Cell viability and mitochondrial function are important determinants of NK-cell antitumor responses in the TME and correlate with therapeutic efficacy.28 The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays a central role in multiple downstream biological processes, including apoptosis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and glycolysis.29 In this study, we also observed that 15×21 CAR-NK cells increased the expression of TF Yin Yang 1, which lies downstream of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and is crucial for sustaining proliferative signaling, apoptosis resistance, and mitochondrial function (online supplemental figure 5D).30 31 We next presented representative molecules involved in these functional processes and found that the expression of the anti-apoptosis molecule BCL-2 and the mitochondria fusion protein FMN2 was positively associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR scores (figure 6A). Moreover, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and found that 15×21 CAR-NK cells showed less enrichment in apoptosis when compared with UTD NK, CAR-NK, and 15 CAR-NK cells (figure 6B). We also found that 15×21 CAR-NK cells exhibited reduced enrichment in the regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway via domain receptors compared with UTD NK and CAR-NK cells, and in the positive regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway compared with 15 CAR-NK cells (figure 6C). These results suggest that the high enrichment of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in 15×21 CAR-NK cells is likely associated with apoptotic inhibition. To further validate these findings, we assessed apoptosis in UTD/engineered NK cells in vitro. As expected, a lower proportion of apoptotic cells and a higher subpopulation of viable cells were observed in the 15×21 CAR-NK group with IL-2 support (figure 6D) or under an IL-2 withdrawal condition (figure 6E,F). Additionally, the anti-apoptotic advantage of 15×21 CAR-NK cells is inhibited by mTOR inhibition, as evidenced by an increased proportion of early apoptotic cells in the 15×21 CAR-NK group treated with rapamycin (figure 6G). These results suggest that the upregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in 15×21 CAR-NK cells is associated with its resistance to apoptosis.",
        "Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis revealed that compared with UTD NK and 15 CAR-NK cells, 15×21 CAR-NK cells showed significant enrichment in mitochondrial translation-related and ATPase activity-related signaling pathways (figure 6H,I). Similarly, Reactome pathway analysis revealed marked enrichment of mitochondrial translation-associated pathways in 15×21 CAR-NK cells (figure 6J). Consistent with the results of transcriptome analysis, we observed a high mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in 15×21 CAR-NK cells at baseline (figure 6K). When co-cultured with Raji cells, 15×21 CAR-NK cells also exhibited increased MMP while reduced mitochondrial mass, suggesting a less senescence phenotype (figure 6L).32 In addition, the superiority of high mitochondrial mass and MMP was diminished by rapamycin (figure 6M). These findings suggest that the increased PI3K/AKT/mTOR activity in 15×21 CAR-NK cells is correlated with enhanced mitochondrial function.",
        "Mitochondrial function and anti-apoptotic characteristics are closely related to the effector functions of cells.33 34 Research has shown that the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is associated with enhanced effector function and reduced exhaustion.35 To further investigate this, we analyzed the effector function and phenotype of 15×21 CAR-NK cells following mTOR inhibition. We found that treatment with rapamycin downregulated the cytotoxic molecules (CD107a, GZMB, and perforin), activation markers (CD25 and CD69), and exhaustion markers (PD-1, TIGIT, and TIM-3) in 15×21 CAR-NK cells (online supplemental figure 6A,B). Additionally, mTOR inhibition also affected NK cell receptors, as evidenced by the downregulation of NKG2D and NKG2A and the upregulation of NKG2C and TRAIL (online supplemental figure 6C). Overall, these data suggest that 15×21 CAR-NK cells exhibit enhanced resistance to apoptosis, improved mitochondrial function, and strengthened cytotoxic activity, all of which are associated with the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.",
        "Mobilizing T cells for combined immunity using CAR-NK cells is a promising therapeutic approach to overcome the limitations of CAR-NK cell monotherapy. Previous studies have shown that co-expression of IL-15 in the CAR structure can enhance the cytotoxic and metabolic functions of CAR-NK cells, prolong their in vivo persistence, and restore their metabolic dysfunction within the suppressive TME.3 7 Among various NK-cell platforms, the NK-92 cell line is a potent cellular resource that demonstrates significant efficacy in both basic research and clinical applications.2 36 37 In this study, we developed novel CAR NK-92 cells that autonomously secrete IL-15 and CCL21. These 15×21 CAR-NK cells exhibited enhanced effector functions and were capable of recruiting T cells for cooperative interactions. This cooperation alleviated mutual exhaustion phenotypes, enhanced the expression of effector molecules and receptors, and contributed to efficiently clearing tumor cells. Additionally, 15×21 CAR-NK cells were highly enriched in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is associated with pro-survival signaling, enhanced anti-apoptotic capabilities, improved mitochondrial function, and cytotoxicity.",
        "Both T cells and NK cells are essential immune cells, and strategies aimed at simultaneously boosting both cell types appear to be promising.14 15 However, the current combination regimens, such as induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NK cells combined with T cells and PD-1 antibody,38 CAR-T cells combined with NK-92 cells,39 and CAR-T cells combined with cord blood-derived NK cells,24 have not fully elucidated the effects and mechanisms of the combination on both immune cell types. In our study, we found that the collaboration process could effectively preserve T cells with a less differentiated phenotype. The T cells involved appeared to have a higher proportion of CD8+ TNaive, CD4+ TCM, and a lower proportion of CD4+ TEFF. Less-differentiated naïve and central memory T-cell subsets exhibited superior persistence of antitumor immunity compared with more-differentiated effector memory and effector T cells, which was associated with favorable clinical outcomes.4043 Notably, the preponderance of less-differentiated T cells might compensate for the limited persistence of CAR NK-92 cells, as irradiation is typically required prior to clinical infusion.44 However, this preservation did not compromise T-cell cytotoxicity, as evidenced by the upregulation of GZMB following co-culture.",
        "Furthermore, the combination could alleviate mutual exhaustion phenotypes by decreasing TIGIT expression on 15×21 CAR-NK cells and reducing LAG-3 levels on T cells. TIGIT plays a key role in inhibiting NK-cell cytotoxicity, promoting NK-cell exhaustion, and mediating tumor escape.45 46 Blockade of TIGIT could restore NK-cell dysfunction and enhance their antitumor immunity.47 Therefore, the reduction in TIGIT expression due to T-cell involvement might contribute to 15×21 CAR-NK cell-mediated effector function. Additionally, LAG-3 is an inhibitory immune checkpoint that represses T-cell activation and effector functions, and promotes tumor immune escape in synergy with PD-1.4850 Blocking LAG-3 could overcome immunosuppression and drive clinical responses; therefore, the reduction in LAG-3 expression might enhance T-cell antitumor potential.51",
        "In addition to its chemotactic function, CCL21 can also promote the proliferation and activation of immune cells, making it widely used in immunotherapy.19 52 53 CCL21 can induce the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.25 The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulates various downstream cellular functions, including the cell cycle, apoptosis resistance, and mitochondrial homeostasis.54 CCL21 can protect CD8+CCR7+ T cells from apoptosis via a mitochondria-mediated pathway.55 Consistent with previous findings, we observed that PI3K/AKT/mTOR-enriched 15×21 CAR-NK cells displayed significant inhibition of apoptosis and enhanced mitochondrial activity, both of which are crucial for functions in the TME. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to IL-15 enhanced NK-cell cytotoxicity at the cost of survival.27 In this study, 15×21 CAR-NK cells exhibited superior performance over 15 CAR-NK cells, with no downregulation of pro-survival signals or TF levels.",
        "In summary, this study developed a novel 15×21 CAR-NK cell product that can recruit T cells and exhibits remarkable effector functions. We elucidated the mutual benefits between 15×21 CAR-NK cells and T cells, providing evidence in support of combined immunotherapy. Additionally, we demonstrated that the co-expression of IL-15 and CCL21 equips them with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal signature, along with improved survival capacity, anti-apoptotic ability, mitochondrial function, and cytotoxicity. In clinical settings, the efficacy of CAR-NK cell monotherapy still requires improvement, and new designs or strategies to enhance CAR-NK cell therapy are urgently needed. Our 15×21 CAR-NK cells have demonstrated effective tumor clearance both in vitro and in vivo. Future research and clinical trials are necessary to validate our findings and further promote the advancement of CAR-NK cell therapy.",

    "title": "Late relapse after CAR-T cell therapy for adult patients with hematologic malignancies: A definite evidence from systematic review and meta-analysis on individual data. innovative and promising approaches to treating hematologic malignancies. CAR-T cell therapy is currently being used for the treatment of relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell malignancies including Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Follicular Lymphoma, Multiple Myeloma and Mantle Cell Lymphoma. Despite the unprecedented clinical success, one of the major issues of the approved CAR-T cell therapy - tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene, lisocabtagene, idecabtagene, ciltacabtagene and brexucabtagene - is the uncertainty about its persistence which in turn could lead to weak or no response to therapy with malignancy recurrence. Here we show that the prognosis of patients who do not respond to CAR-T cell therapy is still an unmet medical need. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis collecting individual data on Duration of Response from at least 12-month follow-up studies. We found that the pooled prevalence of relapse within the first 12 months after CAR-T infusion was 61% (95% CI, 43%-78%); moreover, one year after the infusion, the analysis highlighted a pooled prevalence of relapse of 24% (95% CI, 11%-42%). Our results suggest that identifying potential predictive biomarkers of response to CAR-T therapy, especially for patients affected by the advanced stage of blood malignancies, could lead to stratification of the eligible population to that therapy, recognizing which patients will benefit and which will not, helping regulators to make decision in that way.

      "abstract": "Targeted cell entry with lentiviral vectors (LVs) is one approach to enable efficient and specific gene delivery in the context of immunotherapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy. We have recently shown the generation of CAR-T products with varying CD4:CD8 ratios with our selective, universal Adapter-LV system. However, low viral vector titers limit the clinical and in vivo applications of our measles virus (MV)-based system. Here, we report a novel pseudotype based on canine distemper virus (CDV) for the Adapter-LV system (CDV-Ad-LV) and show improved viral vector yield while maintaining flexibility, selectivity, and transduction efficacy. As for MV, the engineered CDV envelope protein is fused to a single-chain variable fragment that binds biotin in the context of a defined chemical linker. Thereby, Adapter-LVs bind only to biotinylated adapter molecules, which in turn bind the antigen of choice. Besides extensive characterization in vitro , we evaluated transduction in vivo with CDV-Ad-LVs and showed high transduction efficiencies of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells following a single-dose injection into human PBMC-transplanted immunodeficient non-obese diabetic (NOD) SCID gamma (NSG) mice. Hence, CDV-Ad-LVs represent a novel and efficient system for adapter-mediated transduction, which broadens the potential of the Adapter-LV technology, going beyond CAR-T cell therapy applications.",

        "Lentiviral vectors (LVs) can be used as delivery system when a stable gene transfer is desired.1 A prominent example of gene therapies that employ LVs are chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, which have shown remarkable success in patients with hematological malignancies.1,2 However, a considerable number of patients do not achieve durable response or fail to receive CAR T cells in time due to non-immediate availability of these therapies.3,4,5 Conventional CAR-T manufacturing takes up to 3 weeks and comprises T cell enrichment and activation followed by a transduction step with, e.g., LVs pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSVG-LV).1,6,7 Critical process parameters of manufacturing processes are subject of intensive studies to provide a drug product of consistent and high quality (e.g., cellular composition and T cell phenotype).8,9,10,11 To improve CAR-T cell efficacy, production from a defined cell composition, or shortened manufacturing time to obtain T cells of a less differentiated phenotype have been suggested.9,12,13 Alternatively, one may reduce ex vivo manipulations to the absolute minimum or generate CAR-T cells directly in vivo. Both may improve the CAR T efficacy, enabling immediate disease treatment and dramatically reduce manufacturing costs.14,15 However, potential toxicities, for example, cytokine release syndrome and off-target transduction, remain to be elucidated.16,17,18 Of note, some of the risks may be mitigated by selective gene transfer with targeted LVs that enable efficient modification of specific cells of interest. For instance, selectivity was shown by pseudotyping with engineered envelope pseudotypes derived from measles virus (MV) or Nipah virus.19,20,21 MV and Nipah viruses use two different functional envelope proteins to achieve the steps of cell attachment and membrane fusion.19,20 For MV, attachment is mediated by hemagglutinin (H) and membrane fusion by the fusion protein (F). Mutation of the natural receptor binding sites of the H protein and fusion of an engineered scFv abrogates the native viral attachment allowing instead this function to be driven synthetically by linkage of the engineered binding moiety.20,22,23",
        "We have previously developed the versatile MV pseudotype Adapter-LV system (MV-Ad-LV).24 MV-Ad-LV relies on a specific linker-label epitope (LLE)-coupled adapter molecule (e.g., biotinylated antibody or fragment thereof) to enable flexible and selective cell targeting and thereby gene transfer to the cell type of interest (Figure 1A).24 For this, we used a scFv that only binds biotin in the context of a linker, mitigating binding to other biotin molecules present in the body and thereby reducing the risk and severity of potential off-target transduction. Importantly, the transduction efficiency is regulated by the concentration and specificity of the adapter. We were able to validate our MV-Ad-LV system in vitro with CD20-targeting CAR-T cells (CD20CAR-T cells) and varying CD4:CD8 ratios. However, the low yield of functional MV-Ad-LV vector particles of limited its translation to clinical application.Figure 1CDV as novel pseudotype for adapter-mediated transduction with lentiviral vectors(A) Schematic presentation of linker-label epitope (LLE) adapter-mediated transduction with lentiviral vectors (LVs).

        "Recently, the use of envelope proteins derived from another morbillivirus, the canine distemper virus (CDV), for retargeting of oncolytic measles viruses was presented.25,26 We reconstructed our Ad-LV system in the CDV context to evaluate and compare the productivity to MV-Ad-LV. Like with the MV system, we fused the α-LLE scFv to the CDV-H attachment protein to generate a novel CDV-based Adapter-LV system (CDV-Ad-LV). We then evaluated our new CDV-Ad-LV system for (1) selectivity, (2) flexibility, and (3) efficacy as compared to MV-Ad-LVs. Finally, we applied our new CDV-Ad-LV system in an immunodeficient non-obese diabetic (NOD) SCID gamma mice (NSG) mouse model to provide first proof of concept under the most challenging in vivo condition.",
        "Previous studies with envelope proteins derived from paramyxoviruses demonstrated that truncation of the cytoplasmic tail is crucial for efficient pseudotyping of LVs.19,20,27 We explored these observation with our CDV model and screened nine truncated (Δ) H protein variants and an F protein variant and compared these to the respective wild-type (WT) with regard to their ability to generate functional LVs with higher titers (Figure 1B). To enable adapter-mediated retargeting, known receptor recognition sites of the CDV-H protein were ablated as previously described and an α-LLE-specific scFv was C-terminally fused to the CDV-H in all variants.28,29,30 The different H variants were co-transfected with CDV-Fwt or CDV-FΔ30, the helper, and transfer plasmids in HEK-293T cells using the plasmid ratios established for MV pseudotyped LVs.24,31 Established MV glycoproteins (MV-HΔ18/MV-FΔ30) were used as controls.24 As high surface expression of the glycoproteins on producer cells is a prerequisite for high vector titers, we investigated this feature by staining with fluorescently labeled biotin. Two days after transfection, the highest surface expression was observed for H variants truncated by 24–30 amino acids (Figure 1C), which had a 2-fold increase when compared to MV-H control. The collected supernatants from the production were directly titrated on biotinylated SupT1 cells to determine functional titers. Compared to MV-HΔ18/MV-F Δ30, a 15-fold higher titer was detected for CDV-HΔ30 in combination with CDV-FΔ30 (Figure 1D). The other truncations of the H protein, however, showed reduced titers, identifying HΔ30/FΔ30 as being the most efficient combination with unconcentrated titers of ∼107 transducing units (TU)/mL. Improved viral vector titer was confirmed upon production including a concentration step of LV particles, resulting in a 3-fold higher productivity for CDV-Ad-LVs as compared to our previously established MV-Ad-LVs (Figure 1E). Consequently, we selected the combination of CDV-HΔ30/FΔ30 for use in the following experiments. Of note, LVs used in the experiments described here were still produced with a research-grade protocol. In general, clinical-grade LVs are preferably manufactured serum-free with HEK293T cells grown in suspension to facilitate upscaling. Thus, to demonstrate feasibility, CDV-Ad-LV were generated serum-free with suspension HEK293T cells, albeit the productivity was still lower when compared to research-grade production (Figure S1).",
        "After demonstrating that CDV pseudotyped Ad-LVs can be generated with significantly higher titer yields compared to their MV pseudotyped counterpart, we next focused on functional assays to investigate whether CDV-Ad-LVs selectively transduce CD8+ T cells with a CD8-specific adapter. In our previous Ad-LV publication, the order of incubation of the three components (Ad-LV, adapter, and cells) was investigated, resulting in no major differences in transduction efficiency.24 Following the established protocol, SupT1 cells were incubated with different concentrations of LLE-CD8-Fab adapter before transduction with GFP-encoding CDV- or MV-Ad-LV at two doses (Figures 1F and 1G).24 To analyze the transduction efficiency, the frequency of GFP-positive cells was quantified by flow cytometry four days post transduction. As expected, in absence of LLE-CD8-Fab, no GFP-positive cells were detected in the Ad-LV systems above background, while in presence of adapter molecules SupT1 cells were efficiently transduced (Figures 1F and 1G). The highest frequency of GFP-positive cells was obtained with an adapter concentration of 0.1 μg/mL for both Ad-LVs (Figures 1F and 1G). Antigen saturation with higher adapter concentrations may have caused reduced transduction at higher adapter concentrations.24 In conclusion, while CDV-Ad-LV have a higher LV yield, both CDV-Ad-LV and MV-Ad-LV employ the LLE-CD8-Fab with similar efficacy, which is a first conceptual proof that the CDV pseudotype can be used for the Adapter-LV system.",
        "Selectivity and flexibility are key features of the Adapter-LV system, hence we aimed to assess whether the improved CDV-pseudotyped Adapter-LV system retained similar functions in terms of adapter format and specificity as its MV-counterpart on primary cells. For this, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were activated with CD3/CD28 agonists and cultivated in presence of interleukin (IL)-7 and IL-15 to induce activation and proliferation of T cells. Subsequently, activated cells were incubated with different formats of adapter molecules specific for CD4, CD8, or CD19. The adapters were either biotinylated Fab (Figure 2A), F(ab′)2 (Figure 2B), or full-length antibodies (ABs) (Figure 2C) and applied at concentrations of 0.001–1 μg/mL. Subsequently, T cells within PBMCs were transduced with GFP-encoding CDV- or MV-Ad-LVs. Five days post transduction, the transduction efficiency was evaluated on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by quantifying GFP-positive cells by flow cytometry. As previously demonstrated, Vectofusin-1 improved the transduction efficiency for MV-LV and other pseudotypes substantially.24,32 Thus, we also investigated transduction efficiencies in presence (Figure 2) or absence (Figure S2) of Vectofusin-1. As a result, transduction in the absence of adapter or in the presence of non T cell-specific adapters could not be observed for either T cell subsets. For MV-Ad-LV, an on-target to off-target ratio of about 50- to 250-fold was described on primary activated cells depending on adapter specificity and the use of transduction enhancers.24 When comparing both pseudotypes, no significant differences in off-target transduction were observed independent of the adapter specificity and format used or the presence (Figure 2) or absence of Vectofusin-1 (Figure S2). For both types of Ad-LV, we observed selective transduction of the T cell subsets, but in general, higher transduction levels were identified on CD8+ T cells compared to CD4+ T cells. In terms of adapter flexibility, we compared different adapter formats with both Ad-LVs. No significant differences were measured in the transduction efficiency of the two pseudotypes in presence of Fab adapters. In presence of F(ab′)2, however, transduction of CD8+ T cells was significantly higher with CDV-Ad-LV compared to MV-Ad-LV. A tendency for higher transduction was also observed with F(ab′)2 and CDV-Ad-LV on CD4+ T cells. Similarly, when using ABs with CDV-Ad-LV, significantly higher transduction efficiencies were detected for both T cell subsets. These results underline the specific requirements for each adapter format. As expected, transduction efficiency was enhanced in presence of the transduction enhancer Vectofusin-1(Figure 2), but similar patterns were also observed in absence of Vectofusin-1 (Figure S2) in terms of adapter format and concentration.Figure 2Selective transduction of primary T cells using different adapter formatsActivated CD4+ (left) or CD8+ T cells (right) within PBMCs were transduced with GFP-encoding CDV- or MV-Ad-LV with 0.5 TU/cell in absence of adapter (0), in presence of CD4-adapter (clone: MT-466), CD8-adapter (clone: BW135/80), or CD19-adapter (clone: LT19) in presence of the transduction enhancer Vectofusin-1.

        "Transduction of non-activated T cells may be useful for cellular therapies, for example to maintain a naive phenotype and improve self-renewal capacity of CAR-T cells.9 However, the receptor of VSVG pseudotyped LVs, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), is sufficiently expressed only upon polyclonal activation.33 In contrast, CDV-Ad-LV is much more flexible, giving the opportunity to use receptors for targeted transduction that are not activation dependent. To investigate the hypothesis that CDV-Ad-LVs can be used for transduction of T cells in absence of stimulation, T cells of three healthy donors were seeded with IL-7/IL-15 following incubation with LLE-CD8-Fab and subsequent transduction with either GFP-encoding CDV-Ad-LV or VSVG-LV (5 TU/cell) in presence or absence of the integrase inhibitor raltegravir (Figure S3A). As control, T cells activated overnight with CD3/CD28 agonists from the same donors were used (Figure S3B). The next day, LLE-CD8-Fab adapter was added, followed by transduction as described before. The transduction efficiency was determined eight days later to ensure sufficient expression levels and exclude false-positive results (i.e., pseudotransduction). While transduction efficiency on activated CD8+T cells was comparable for both LVs, significantly higher transduction efficiency levels were achieved with CDV-Ad-LV in absence of CD3/CD28 stimulation relative to VSV-G. As expected, no GFP-positive cells were detected above the detection limit in CD4+ T cells using CDV-Ad-LV, while VSVG-LV transduced only CD3/CD28 stimulated CD4+ T cells with high efficiency. In presence of raltegravir, no GFP-positive cells were detected, excluding pseudotransduction. In summary, we show that CDV-Ad-LV is highly versatile having demonstrated selective, flexible, and efficient transduction of primary T cells with different specificities and adapter formats.",

Analogously, we evaluated if functional CAR-T cells could also be generated with CDV-Ad-LV.",
        "Activated, enriched T cells were incubated with either CD4- or CD8-specific LLE-F(ab′)2 adapters alone or in combination in ratios of 1:1 and 5:1, before adding CD20CAR-encoding CDV-Ad-LV. The frequency of CAR-positive cells was determined twelve days after transduction by staining for the co-expressed transduction marker, the low-affinity nerve groth factor receptor (LNGFR), by flow cytometry (Figure 3A). As expected, for the conditions with only one adapter specificity, only the T cell subset expressing the corresponding marker was transduced. Accordingly, when the adapter mixture was applied, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were transduced, whereby the subset ratio or respectively transduced T cells correlated with the adapter ratio (Figures 3A and 3B). The overall transduction efficiency of CD3+ T cells was similar for all products, ranging from 10% to 20% (Figure S4A).Figure 3Generation of CD20CAR-T cells with CDV-Adapter-LVTo generate CAR-T cells pan T cells were activated and transduced with CDV-Ad-LV encoding a CD20CAR and the transduction marker LNGFR (0.5 TU/cell) in presence of Vectofusin-1 and in presence of either LLE-CD4-F(ab′)2 (clone: M-T466) or LLE-CD8-F(ab′)2 (clone: BW135/80) adapters alone or a mixed in 1:1 or 1:5 ratio.

        "Next, we aimed to assess the anti-tumor activity of CAR-T cells in co-culture with GFP+CD20+ Raji cells at an effector-to-target ratio (E:T) of 1:1. The specific lysis of the tumor cells was analyzed by quantification of the GFP-expressing Raji cells by flow cytometry after 24 h (Figure 3C). An average lysis of 60% of target cells was observed, which was independent of the CD4:CD8 ratio. Untransduced T cells served as control and showed no significant reduction in tumor cell counts. In addition, secreted cytokines were quantified by flow-based analysis, and secretion was only observed when tumor cells were co-cultured with CAR-T cells and not with unmodified T cells (Figure 3D). Although not significant, a tendency of higher interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secretion by CAR-T cell products containing CD8+ CAR-T cells was detected, while products containing CD4+ CAR-T cells had pronounced tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion. We measured similar tendencies of LAG-3 and TIM-3 expression in the different CAR-T cell products (Figure 3E). The frequency of CD4+ CAR-T cells expressing PD-1 decreased in presence of CD8+ CAR-T cells. The same trends were found in triple positive T cells, although no significant difference was observed. This is likely a CAR-triggered effect as no significant differences in marker expression were monitored either prior to co-culture (Figure S4B) or in CAR-negative T cells (Figures S4C and S4D). However, it is possible, that our results are dependent upon CAR design or influenced by different tumor types. Therefore, evaluating less favorable E:T ratios, tumor re-challenge, as well as investigating additional tumor cell lines and CAR designs may reveal further differences between CD4+ and CD8+ CAR-T cells.",

        "In vivo gene or protein transfer with selective delivery tools is of high interest for gene therapy as well as basic research applications such as gene function studies in disease models.34,35,36 Hence, we wanted to test whether CDV-Ad-LV can cell-selectively deliver genes in a preclinical in vivo model. For proof of concept, we again chose a CAR as transgene to be delivered to CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells. To investigate CD20CAR gene delivery by CDV-Ad-LV directly in vivo, NSG mice were transplanted with human PBMCs comprising as main populations T cells, natural killer (NK) T cells, NK cells, monocytes, and B cells (Figure S5A). One day after PBMC injection, 50 μg LLE-CD8-Fab was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) followed by intravenous injection (i.v.) of 7.5 × 107 TU/mouse CD20CAR-encoding CDV-Ad-LV (Figure 4A). Similar to the protocol employed for adapter-mediated transduction in vitro, the short incubation period of the adapter facilitates adapter binding while minimizing the risk of decay or degradation. In terms of improved safety during administration, adapter and CDV-Ad-LV are given separately, while CDV-Ad-LV without adapter is transduction incompetent. To determine the transduction efficiency, the frequency of CD20CAR-expressing human cells was measured by detecting the co-expressed transduction marker LNGFR in blood over time (Figures 4B and S6B). Analyzing the kinetic of transduced T cells in vivo, no CAR-positive CD8+ T cells were detected in blood five days post LV injection, while an average of 20% was observed on day twelve, which decreased 2-fold by the end of the analysis. The mice were sacrificed 15 days post transduction and the frequency of human and CAR-positive cells was quantified in blood, bone marrow, and spleen tissue. Comparable frequencies of human CD45-positive cells in untreated and CDV-Ad-LV-treated groups were detected in all tissues analyzed (Figure S5C). We observed selective and efficient gene transfer only to CD8+ T cells, as indicated by no detectable transduction marker positive cells in the CD4+ T cell subset (Figure 4C). The frequency of CAR-positive CD8+ T cells was similar in all tissue samples analyzed (Figures 4D and S6B). Interestingly, we observed an overall shift toward the CD8+ T cell subset in the CDV-Ad-LV-treated samples as compared to UTD (Figures 4E and S6C). Finally, efficient depletion of B cells was observed in all tissue samples analyzed in the CDV-Ad-LV-treated group, indicating the generation of functional CAR-T cells in vivo by adapter-mediated gene transfer (Figure 4F). Importantly, all animals showed no significant differences in weight and overall appearance and tolerated the adapter and Adapter-LV application well (Figure S5B). Overall, this provides first proof of concept for CD8-specific adapter-mediated T cell transduction in vivo.Figure 4CDV-A-LV allows adapter-mediated gene transfer in vivo(A) Human PBMCs were isolated from leukapheresis (LP) and cultivated overnight in IL-7 and IL-15 before injected into NSG mice.

        "Having demonstrated proof of concept for in vivo transduction with CDV-Ad-LV and CD8-specific adapter, we aimed next to evaluate whether alternative adapter specificities show similar results and simultaneous transduction of different T cell subsets is possible.",
        "Using the same mouse model as before, we now assessed adapter-mediated CD20CAR gene delivery to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by applying the respective LLE-Fab adapter alone or in a 1:1 mixture (mix) of both adapter specificities (Figure 5). Again, human PBMCs were injected one day prior to adapter and CDV-Ad-LV application (Figure S7A). For the previous experiment, no CAR-expressing cells were detected above background levels five days post-transduction. To pinpoint the earliest day allowing to detect CAR-transduced T cells, first blood samples were analyzed seven days post-transduction (Figure 5A). The mice were sacrificed on day 17 post-LV injection and were analyzed for presence of co-expressed LNGFR. In general, we were able to detect human transduced cells on day 7 in both T cell subsets dependent on adapter specificity (Figures 5B and S7). However, at the same time point, only one out of five mice from the CD4-specific adapter-treated group showed a detectable CAR-positive population in the CD4+ T cell subset. Interestingly, when the mixture of CD4- and CD8-specific adapter was applied, the frequency of transduced CD4+ T cells peaked on day 13 and decreased until day 17, while the frequency of transduced CD4+ T cells continued to increase when LLE-CD4-Fab was administered alone, reaching 40% at the end of the analysis. In the CD8+ T cell subset on day 7, the frequency of transduced cells was 20% on average in presence of CD8-specific adapter alone or in mixture with CD4-specific adapters. As described previously, the frequency of CAR-positive CD8+ T cells peaked at around 50% on day 13 in both adapter conditions and declined to an average of 10% by day 17. We suspect these differences between CD4+ and CD8+ CAR-T cells may be caused by transgene expression level or initial transduction efficiency depending on the T cell subtype.Figure 5Assessment of CDV-Ad-LV adapter-specificity for gene transfer in vivo(A) Human PBMCs were isolated from leukapheresis (LP) and cultivated overnight in IL-7 and IL-15 before injected into NSG mice.

        "When investigating transduced T cells at the end of the study, the CAR frequencies in transduced T cells from bone marrow and spleen mirrored those observed in blood, both within T cell subsets and in the presence of the respective adapters (Figures 5C and 5D). When evaluating the functionality of CAR-T cells, only in the CD4-specific adapter-treated group B cells were still detectable, correlating with the higher transduction efficiency in CD4+ T cells (Figure S7E). No remaining B cells were present when CD8+ CD20CAR-T cells were generated. In addition, we assessed the ratio of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in different tissues (Figure 5E). As seen before, a shift of CD4:CD8 ratio toward the respective transduced T cell subsets was observed. In presence of both LLE-Fabs, the frequency of the CD8+ T cell subset was higher, indicating a change in ratio compared to the beginning of the experiment (Figures S7A and S7J). These observations suggest expansion in vivo of the respective subset triggered by CAR-induced proliferation.",
        "Lentiviral transduction induces genomic integration of the vector genome with single or multiple copies, potentially influencing transgene expression levels. Hence, we wanted to evaluate the number of integrated copies of LV genome per cell upon the application of CDV-Ad-LV in vivo. Therefore, spleens isolated on day 17 were dissociated with gentleMACS tissue dissociator and isolated cells were expanded after activation, analyzed by flow cytometry, and genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated. Analysis of the vector copy number (VCN per transduced cell) was performed on 3–5 samples per group by quantitative PCR (Figures 6 and S8). The VCN calculation includes the frequency of transduced cells, which was determined by flow cytometry (Figure S8A). In general, a tendency of higher VCNs in samples with LLE-CD8 adapters was observed, compared to samples treated with LLE-CD4 adapters, although not significant (Figure 6B).Figure 6Vector copy number analysis of in vivo generated CAR-T cells(A) Spleens extracted on day 17 were dissociated and splenocytes were expanded before genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated.

        "Having observed remarkably high frequencies of CAR transduced T cells in both T cell subsets, we hypothesized that CAR antigen encounter and subsequent T cell expansion might have contributed to the high frequencies indicating that the initial transduction efficiency could be lower. Thus, we wanted to determine the gene transfer rates into CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the absence of CAR antigen driven expansion. Hence, we subsequently aimed for an in vivo experiment using GFP instead of CAR as transgene (Figure S9A). To determine the CD4:CD8 ratio as well as transduction efficiency, the mice were sacrificed seven days after LV injection and analyzed for presence of transduced human cells. Comparable frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected in untreated and CDV-Ad-LV-treated groups (Figure S9B). Similar frequencies of GFP-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected in cells isolated from spleen tissue and bone marrow samples, indicating efficient gene transfer to both T cell subsets in absence of antigen driven expansion (Figure S9C).",
        "Demonstrating efficient in vivo gene transfer with our CDV-Ad-LV platform, we finally aimed to investigate transduction of T cells that have not been incubated with cytokines prior to injection. Therefore, PBMCs were incubated overnight in medium without addition of cytokines before injection into NSG mice. Subsequently, LLE-CD8-Fab and CD20CAR-encoding CDV-Ad-LV were injected as described previously (Figure S10). The mice were sacrificed 15 days post transduction and the frequency of CAR-positive cells was quantified in blood and spleen tissue. In comparison to our previous study, we observed higher frequencies of CD8+ CAR-T cells isolated from blood and spleen tissue as well as B cell depletion, indicating efficient generation of functional CD8+ CAR-T cells in NSG mice transplanted with PBMCs that were not incubated with cytokines overnight before injection (Figures S10C and S10D). In addition, no transduction among murine CD45 cells was found above detection limit, confirming selective transduction with CDV-Ad-LV in vivo (Figures S9 and S10).",
        "Taken together, the results provide proof-of-concept evidence for simultaneous and selective transduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with CDV-Ad-LVs in vivo.",
        "We previously reported the development of a versatile targeting system for LVs based on MV pseudotypes. This system requires the presence of biotinylated adapter molecules to facilitate gene delivery to the cell type of interest. The transduction efficiency is regulated by adapter concentration and adapter format.24 Despite selectivity and flexibility, the low viral titers of this platform so far limited sophisticated in vivo studies. Here we aimed to overcome the current limitations by generating and evaluating an alternative LV pseudotype derived from CDV. The rationale to use CDV was that (1) mutations to prevent binding to its natural receptors have been described and (2) retargeting using CDV was described with oncolytic measles viruses.25,26 Thus, we demonstrate here for the first time the use of engineered CDV envelope proteins for pseudotyping of LVs in the context of the Adapter-LV system.",
        "For envelope proteins of paramyxoviruses, the key to successful pseudotyping was the identification of cytoplasmic glycoprotein tail truncations that enable incorporation into LV particles.19,20,27 We identified cytoplasmic tail truncations of 30 amino acids for the CDV-proteins H and F as being optimal for pseudotyping (Figure 1). Although the highest surface expression levels were observed with HΔ24 and Fwt, the highest LV titer was obtained with CDV HΔ30/FΔ30. Surface expression of the envelope proteins is critical for incorporation into particles, which is necessary for functional particle production, but high expression does not necessarily result in high titers of transducing particles.19 Thus, the combination of HΔ30/FΔ30 suggest a better incorporation of H and F in this configuration.",
        "In terms of LV particle yield, state-of-the-art LVs pseudotyped with VSV-G are produced with ∼107 TU/mL (unconcentrated), which is 50- to 100-fold higher compared to MV-pseudotyped Adapter-LVs or other published targeted paramyxovirus-pseudotyped LVs.20,24,27,37 In contrast, we were able to produce CDV-Ad-LVs with only 5- to 10-fold lower titers compared to VSV-G-LVs. This result was readily obtained even without additional process optimizations. Higher viral titers would make the CDV-Ad-LV system also more cost-efficient than other targeted systems and thereby lowers the required effort to advance the Adapter-LV system toward further research and clinical applications. Improved surface expression of the envelope proteins on HEK293T cells and subsequently on LV particles may have contributed to the higher titers observed here. An alternative explanation could be that more particles were released upon transfection or less defective particles were generated. Here, further analysis (e.g., employing a p24 ELISA as well as using particle tracking) may help to address this question. For clinical translation, LV production under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions is required, which includes manufacturing in a closed system and downstream purification to remove impurities, e.g., proteins or plasmid DNA.38 Our first proof-of-concept studies confirmed CDV-Ad-LV being compatible with production protocols using suspension HEK293T cells. Vector yield may be further improved by investigation of process parameters, such as the optimal plasmid ratio for CDV-Ad-LV production, cell density, and the transfection protocol. Compatibility with GMP downstream processing remains to be assessed as physical characteristics of LV particles may differ from classical VSVG-LVs.1,38",
        "Besides viral vector titers, selectivity is crucial for safe and efficient gene transfer, particularly for more sophisticated CAR-T cell manufacturing processes when T cells are not enriched. Nonselective transduction may not only reduce the transduction efficiency for the target cells, necessitating higher doses, but also poses the inherent risk of off-target transduction, which may cause side effects.16 Following the established protocol for Ad-LV mediated transduction can address these concerns, as LV transduction is reduced to background levels without adapter. For the previous study with the MV-Adapter-LV technology, we provided a detailed analysis on the aspect of selectivity.24 Here, we now confirm the high degree of selectivity for the CDV-pseudotyped Ad-LV system. We demonstrate highly selective gene transfer to primary human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in presence of their respective adapters. This high degree of selectivity was independent of adapter formats and concentrations used (Figure 2). Interestingly, for F(ab′)2 and antibody-based adapter, significantly higher transduction efficiencies were observed with CDV-Ad-LV as compared to MV-Ad-LV. This points toward potential differences in optimal distance of lentiviral membrane to target antigen or minimum required affinity. While the higher degree of flexibility of the CDV-Ad-LVs is well appreciated, the underlying mechanism needs to be investigated. Transduction of non-activated T cells is of high interest in the field, as cellular therapies containing quiescent or less differentiated T cells may provide better therapeutic efficacy.18 Current data on non-activated T cell transduction is limited as cultivation of T cells in absence of activation has been quite challenging. Most studies showing transduction in the absence T cell activation with targeted systems either activate the cells at later stages or use CD3 directly for targeting.22,39,40 Here we show selective transduction to T cells only cultured in IL-7/IL-15 even in the absence of transduction enhancers (Figure S3). While transduction of activated T cells was comparable when transduced with CDV-Ad-LV and VSVG-LV, CDV-Ad-LV performed better than VSVG-LV in the absence of CD3/CD28 activation. Therefore, VSVG-LV is the gold standard for transduction of activated T cells, while the Ad-LV system can be used for more challenging transduction conditions, e.g., complex samples, difficult-to-transduce cell types, or resting T cells.",
        "For the MV-Ad-LV system in the previous study, we successfully generated CD4+ and CD8+ CD20CAR-T cells with varying CD4:CD8 ratios in vitro.24 Hence, we aimed to evaluate CDV-Ad-LV for this kind of application as well. The current CAR-T cell manufacturing process requires isolation and activation of T cells.6 Using the Adapter-LV technology, isolation is no longer required and selective manipulation of the target cells within this complex cell suspension is possible. This can lower cost and complexity of the process, but requires adapter production under good manufacturing conditions. Our analysis is in line with our published data showing similar lysis capacity, secretion of cytokines, and activation/exhaustion marker expression.24 Hence, the CDV-Ad-LV system provides a promising alternative for the current vector systems utilized for CAR-T cell generation.",
        "With this optimized Adapter-LV system, we can achieve selective transduction even when it is directly applied in mice. For adapter-mediated gene transfer in vivo, we decided to continue using LLE-Fab molecules as they provide better tissue penetration and shorter half-life compared to full-length ABs.41 With this, time for transduction was restricted providing better safety. Using CDV-Ad-LV we demonstrate efficient and selective gene transfer of GFP or CD20CAR into CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in vivo. In comparison to our in vitro study, lower frequencies of transduced T cells were observed (Figures S4A and S7G). While we measured comparable initial frequencies of GFP-positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we measured higher initial frequencies of CD8+ CAR-T cells compared to CD4+ CAR-T cells in vivo—which we did not observe in our in vitro assay. The influence of the adapter concentration, incubation time, or application route in vivo has not yet been evaluated and efforts in these areas could increase transduction results further. Moreover, these differences may have been caused by the activation/stimulation state of the in vitro versus in vivo generated CAR-T cells. Importantly, no CD3/CD28 stimulation with and without cytokines was used in our in vivo experiments. This is in contrast with other studies demonstrating in vivo generation of CAR-T cells, using PBMC-activated ex vivo and/or IL-7 injections into mice.15,42,43 Interestingly, Agarwal et al. showed 10- to 20-fold higher frequencies of CD4+ CAR-T cells on day 7 when compared to the present study. These differences may be explained by (1) the activation of the injected PBMCs and application routes; (2) usage of the different CAR construct; (3) the amount of infused LV particles; (4) the LV itself; and (5) its targeting moiety.15 This suggests that CD4+ T cells may need additional activation to enhance transduction, as described in an in vivo study by Zhou et al.42 Additionally, the higher frequencies observed in our studies for CD4+ CAR-T cells, may result from a proliferative advantage due to longer presence of target cells in circulation, as CD4+ CAR-T cells have delayed killing kinetics compared to CD8+ CAR-T cells.10,44 Indeed, a remaining B cell population was only detected in mice treated with CD4-specific adapter, while no B cells were found in presence of CD8+ CAR-T cells. In contrast, the results presented by Agarwal and Ho showed faster CD4+ CAR-T cell detection and killing compared to a mixed population, again hinting toward differences between activated and non-activated CD4+ T cells.15,43",
        "For CD8+ T cells, we observed similar CAR frequencies at day 7 as reported by Frank et al., although this work used GFP as transgene and injected activated PBMCs.45 The cell activation status may potentially be another reason why we observed lower frequencies in our setup, when using GFP as a transgene as well. We observed a decline in frequency in the CD8+ CAR-T cell group as well as in the mixed group toward the end of our analysis (Figures 4B, 5B, and 5C). This decrease may have resulted from target cell depletion and therefore absence of further CAR stimulus, which might be faster in groups with CD8+ CAR-T cells due to their higher cytolytic potential.10 Furthermore, this decrease may be influenced by homing to other organs or epigenic silencing. Further studies are required to investigate biodistribution of CAR-T cells to different organs, detailed analysis of CAR-T cells exhaustion, and in-depth integration site analysis. Cytokine stimulation such as with IL-7 and IL-15 is reported to make T cells more permissive for lentiviral transduction.46,47 In fact, even in absence of cytokine stimulation, we were able to efficiently generate CD8+ CAR-T cells in vivo. In general, no transduction of murine CD45 cells was detectable in any blood and spleen tissue sample. However, assessment of transduction in other cell types and tissues remains to be determined to confirm selective gene transfer using CDV-Ad-LV in vivo.",
        "The VCN analysis revealed higher copy numbers for CD8+ CAR-T cells. This may indicate more efficient transduction, but could also result from aggregation of LV. The difference in the transduction process or susceptibility for transgene silencing of both T cell subsets as well as determining the activation status of the cells require additional experiments to elucidate. In fact, our studies as well as the vast majority of published research on targeted in vivo gene transfer is conducted in conventional NSG mice.39,42,43 An important consideration for future research is the use of a major histocompatibility complex class I- and II-deficient NSG mouse model. This approach would mitigate T cell activation due to xenoreactivity and potentially extend the duration of the study, allowing for the assessment of long-term efficacy under conditions that closely mimic real in vivo environments.48",
        "To date, several approaches using adapter-mediated gene transfer have been generated. Previously reported biotin adapter systems, which rely on streptavidin or avidin, bear the risk of unspecific adsorption to non-biotinylated proteins, free biotin, or protein-bound biotin.49,50,51,52,53 In contrast, by using a scFv that binds biotin only in context of a specific linker, selectivity of the system is highly improved.24 Using targeted adenoviral vectors, only low transduction efficiencies in T cells as well as off-target transduction of B cells was observed using trimeric adapter constructs in vivo.54 Although strong binding interactions between vector and adapter were described, vectors showed transduction of target cells also without adapter coating, highlighting potential risk of off-target transduction.54,55 Another popular and versatile targeting approach is based on Sindbis virus (SINV)-pseudotyped LVs, which is based on adapter binding molecules as well. Again, background transduction in absence of adapter and low productivity hamper this system for selective and efficient gene transfer, in particular when moving toward in vivo gene delivery.49 Although it has been shown that CD19CAR-T cells can be generated using SINV-LV in vivo, the frequency of CAR-positive T cells remained low.50 Currently, when aiming for simultaneous transduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, either bispecific Fabs for CD3 and SINV receptor E2 redirecting SINV-LVs or CD3-targeted LVs were used.39,50 In this particular case, T cells are activated via CD3/T cell receptor engagement, which may increase transduction efficiency. However, no control over the actual transduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is given. To allow specific and controlled transduction of T cell subsets, a mixture of two directly targeted LVs would be required, which means that two different LVs need to be generated and tested, which in turn impedes direct comparison of the two LVs.15,19,42 Using the adapter-technology, only one LV is needed, preventing differences due to different titration methods or preferred entry mechanisms by the LV. Using CDV as pseudotype in the Adapter-LV system we were able to maintain the flexibility and precise transduction of this system, while improving the titer. The CDV-Ad-LV platform can provide efficient transduction in vitro and in vivo by generating functional CAR-T cells from non-activated PBMCs. This can potentially simplify the process toward rapid CAR-T cell manufacturing ex vivo. Additionally, characterizing this novel pseudotype for LVs in terms of stability will promote a better understanding of its performance in vitro and in vivo.",
        "This study presents data on CDV as novel pseudotype for selective modification of cells using the Adapter-LV technology. Although targeted LVs are more and more used for in vivo transduction, they often have low titers and need additional cell stimulation for efficient transduction.15 CDV-pseudotyped-LVs represent an optimization of the Adapter-LV system. The improved productivity of this technology offers expanded applications for various gene therapeutic approaches in research and clinical settings in vitro and in vivo.",

Here we discuss POC production of CAR T products.",
        "Autologous chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell (CAR T) therapy has revolutionized the management of relapsed/refractory B-cell and plasma-cell malignancies. There are six different FDA approved autologous CAR T products manufactured by four different pharmaceutical companies (Table 1) (1–12). There are also more than 200 active CAR T clinical trials in the United States to optimize CAR T therapy efficacy, mitigate toxicities and broaden disease indications to additional hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, and even non-malignant diseases (13–18) The use of autologous CAR T therapy is expected to grow exponentially, but this growth will likely exacerbate two major current limitations of CAR T therapy: patient access and financial burden to the healthcare system (19–22).",
        "Commercially produced CAR-T cell products.",
        "Access is a major limitation even in large academic comprehensive cancer centers in the United States, where five out of the six FDA approved CAR T products were developed, and where the current commercial products are centrally manufactured. The access may be limited by the CAR T manufacturing capacity offered by pharmaceutical companies (23–25). Patients often wait up to 3 weeks for a “manufacturing slot”, an allocated date when the company can receive the patient's autologous apheresis product to start manufacturing CAR T cells (26–29).",
        "Another major access limitation is the prolonged manufacturing and release time that frequently ranges from 2 to 4 weeks. Candidates for CAR T therapy usually have aggressive diseases and are heavily pre-treated, and often may decline clinically and become ineligible while waiting to receive treatment (24, 25, 27). Manufacture delays can be attributed to the approved methods used for transduction and expansion of T-cells, mainly based on technology from when the products were initially developed over 10 years ago. Moreover, because of the centralized nature of the process, shipment, and cryopreservation are required adding more time to the clinically significant “vein-to-vein” time (time from leukapheresis to CAR T infusion) (28).",
        "Lastly, the current costs of commercially manufactured CAR T products total nearly $500,000 USD, in addition to other clinical costs with medications, hospitalization, transfusions etc. Such costs present a major burden on the healthcare system of developed countries and, therefore, are prohibitive for most of the population in the developing world (21, 22, 28). There is an unmet need to optimize the current model of CAR T manufacture, so both the “vein-to-vein” time and costs are minimized. To this end, there are two approaches of large interest: use of off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR T and decentralized in-house autologous CAR T manufacture (30–33) Despite the enthusiasm for the development of off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR T seen in multiple ongoing trials, so far their efficacy and persistence have been limited by rejection, on top of significant donor variability leading to significant T-cell fitness differences (31, 34, 35).",
        "Here, we review the decentralized in-house CAR T manufacturing model. We also discuss different platforms available for decentralized in-house manufacturing (Table 2) and the challenges associated with implementation of these procedures.",
        "Different place-of-care manufacturing.",
        "There are two different logistical approaches to CAR T manufacturing: (1) the standard centralized process where the product is manufactured in cell therapy laboratories controlled by the pharmaceutical company; (2) the decentralized method where CAR T products are manufactured in one or more cell therapy laboratories within the academic healthcare system to support clinical trials and eventually even commercial manufacturing. The outline of various steps involved is mentioned below (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 15, 20, 24, 32, 36–38).\n(1)Cell collection: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are collected through leukapheresis in an accredited healthcare facility. The cells are transported in a stringent cold chain system either at 2–8°C for fresh products or below −150°C for cryopreserved products (20, 36, 37).(2)CAR T manufacturing: CAR T products are manufactured in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations, following multiple steps, detailed below (39).\n(a)T-cell enrichment from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and activation using CD3/CD28 antibodies (5, 6, 12, 40–46).(b)Genetic engineering of the T-cells to induce CAR expression, most commonly through transduction with viral vectors (non-viral approaches are under investigation) (1, 3–6, 47–49).(c)CAR T expansion and harvesting in the presence of specific cytokines (1, 3–6, 15, 42, 45).(d)QC testing and release by the QA unit prior to distribution is critically important and typically takes 2–3 weeks. Fresh CAR T products typically must be infused within 48 h of harvest (19, 20, 50).(3)Administration: After release from centralized manufacture, the cryopreserved product is shipped in temperature-monitored packaging to the healthcare facility where the patient will be treated. Prior to infusion of CAR T products, patients are subjected to a lymphodepleting agent over several days (1, 3–6).",

Prior to infusion of CAR T products, patients are subjected to a lymphodepleting agent over several days (1, 3–6).",
        "Traditionally, small-scale manufacturing procedures utilize open systems in which a bag, tube or culture vessel with cells is open to the environment, albeit in an aseptic manner. Such open systems are almost completely manual and, as such, require multiple highly skilled laboratory scientists and technologists working hands-on for several full days over the culture period. Compared to truly closed systems, open systems are also more susceptible to microbiologic contamination and human error. Product manipulation is conducted in a classified cleanroom. CAR T production also requires co-culture of the stimulated T-cells with a gene vector (frequently a replication deficient viral vector), which also must be handled in a controlled environment that prevents exposure of the technical personnel or the laboratory environment (42, 51–54).",
        "Alternatively, closed/automated systems utilize platform devices (e.g., CliniMACS Prodigy©, Lonza Cocoon© and others) that enable the apheresis product to move through the multiple steps of CAR T manufacture (T-cell isolation, activation, transduction, and CAR T expansion) inside a single use, disposable kit that is not directly opened to the environment. Sample removal and reagent or media addition are accomplished through sterile tubing welders or aseptic access ports, thus maintaining what is known as a “functionally closed system”. These automated systems may be operated in facilities with less stringent air classifications (i.e., ISO 8 or even unclassified space, as opposed to ISO 7) and mean significantly less hands-on time, and more consistent handling during manufacture. These advantages make automated manufacturing devices the preferred method for decentralized CAR T manufacture. It should be noted, however, that currently available devices are used for one CAR T product at a single time. To accommodate large patient volumes, centers would need to have multiple instruments with high price tags and requiring significant bench or floor space and implement well-controlled protocols for optimally timing the ending of one product's manufacture and apheresis collection and initiation of another product's run (13, 15, 23, 24, 30, 32, 38, 55, 56).",
        "A third option is a hybrid semi-closed/semi-automatic system. Here, each individual step is automated, but done in separated devices with minimal manual product handling between steps/modules. This process can be facilitated by a robotic arm to minimize human error (57).",
        "All CAR T cell products approved by the FDA are manufactured centrally. The treating physician prescribes a specific FDA approved CAR T product and patient's PBMCs are shipped from the treating healthcare facility to the central manufacturing cell therapy laboratory. Often, pharmaceutical companies have a facility in North America and another in the European Union to supply the two main CAR T markets. After manufacture and cryopreservation, the product is shipped back to the treating healthcare facility (1, 3–6, 12). The main advantage of centralized manufacture is quality standardization that minimizes inter-product variability. The increased oversight and control afforded by a centralized manufacturing model was critical for commercialization of a labor-intense manual process (19, 20, 29). However, due to the personalized nature of autologous CAR T production, it is not possible to deliver a truly uniform CAR T product. There also remain many drawbacks with the centralized model as listed previously: long waiting time, patient access, and financial burden. Centrally manufactured CAR T products often spend more time in the QC/QA processes than in manufacturing (19, 20, 29).",
        "In the decentralized model, the product is manufactured within or very near the same healthcare system where the patient will be treated. This model minimizes or eliminates the need for cryopreservation and improves timing and potentially costs. For instance, eliminating cryopreservation of the starting material can potentially influence cell quantity and quality, as the recovery and viability of PBMCs is often reduced after freezing and thawing compared with fresh apheresis products (24, 29, 30, 38, 58, 59). In the USA, the decentralized manufacturing model has been restricted to academic centers in the context of clinical trials. Initially, prior to CAR T FDA approvals, heavily manual POC manufacture was used exclusively for early phase, single center clinical trials at a select few institutions. Later, these groups transferred their technology and patents to biotechnology startups and large pharmaceutical companies that led the multi-center studies that adopted centralized manufacture strategies and resulted in the current FDA approvals (51–54).",
        "The rapid development of bioreactors and other technologies is enabling a paradigm shift in which POC production is becoming more accessible. The use of automated closed systems including such as CliniMACS Prodigy© and Cocoon© has drastically reduced the need for clean rooms thereby decreasing the need for expensive infrastructure (15, 32, 60) Importantly, these automated systems comply with federal regulations requiring software that may generate electronic records involved in the manufacture of biologics. These systems can currently accommodate a lentiviral gene vector or non-viral vectors for T-cell transduction, with all subsequent steps through formulation which are conducted within this closed automated unit (61) The final product often is produced in a shorter manufacturing time (commonly 7–10 days vs. 14 days) and at a lower cost compared to centralized manufacturing, although there are not commercially available POC CAR T in the USA. Decentralized manufacturing also removes the risks and costs of transportation and may be infused fresh. The average cost of production of in-house CAR T cells can be as low as $35,000 USD if viral vector is provided by a sponsor or collaborator and is variable between $50,000- $1 million if GMP vector must be purchased by the center (29, 30) This does not include costs required for setup, staffing and maintenance.",
        "Here, we briefly describe the available bioreactors that provide a functionally closed GMP-compliant cell processing system. Various pros and cons of each platform is discussed in Table 3 (23).\n(A)CliniMACS Prodigy® system- The CliniMACS cell system was established in 1997 by Miltenyi Biotec for enrichment and depletion of specific cell types using magnetically labeled antibodies. The Prodigy system represents a technology that automates all the necessary steps of CAR T production beyond T cell enrichment, such as activation, transduction, washing, and media feeding in one closed tubing system. An electroporation attachment is now available allowing gene editing capabilities on one device. Though this platform ensures GMP compliance and reduces strict clean room requirements, some steps are still manual and extensive training is required. Nevertheless, this system is commonly used for production in academic medical centers throughout the world (13, 30, 61, 62).(B)The Cocoon® platform- The Cocoon system from Lonza is another closed manufacturing system that is based on a single use transportable cassette. The cassette internalizes all the media and reagents and can maintain the reagents in a temperature-controlled environment, although T cell enrichment currently must be performed on a CliniMACS device. The limitation again is that some steps are still manual, particularly if electroporation is needed (58, 60).(C)ekko™ acoustic cell processing system- The ekko™ system from MilliporeSigma is a novel GMP-compliant platform that utilizes acoustophoresis as a method of cell processing and production. This can be utilized for separating TCR-positive from TCR-negative cells and has been used for other therapies like NK cells. The disadvantage of this system is that it has not been widely utilized for CAR T cell production and hence data is limited (62).(D)G-Rex® bioreactor M series- Wilson Wolf's gas permeable rapid membrane technology allows G-Rex flasks to support the production of high cell density products over short culture durations in a familiar tissue culture flask format, but without the large capital investment of fully automated systems. Several different sizes from 2 cm2 to 500 cm2 make scaling up a classic T-flask method straight-forward. In addition, closed system G-Rex flasks with sterile fluid paths are now available, along with a liquid handling pump, the GatheRex, that simplifies and accelerates media exchange and cell harvesting. A limitation of this system is that manual monitoring of cell density and decision-making about splitting cultures to additional vessels are required quite often during production (62, 63).(E)Other technologies that are still under review to support widespread POC production include: the ThermoGenesis CAR TXpress™ platform, the Gibco CTS Rotea™, the Terumo Quantum® cell expansion system and the Cytiva perfusion media (62–64).",

        "For all the promises and advancements in POC production, the process of implementing such a manufacturing system includes many challenges that must be overcome, including personnel training, quality management, facilities design, financing, and reagent sourcing.",
        "Automated systems often use vectors including genetically modified lentivirus for transduction of CAR T cells during their production. Limited commercial production of GMP-grade viral vectors presents a universal challenge for all institutions aiming to manufacture CAR T cells. Institutions looking to implement POC manufacturing should establish early partnerships with viral vector suppliers or consider bringing GMP vector production in house to have better control over timelines. Interestingly, vector manufacturing capability is expanding worldwide (19, 20, 65–67). It is important to note that the cost will vary depending on the amount of testing required by the client, the size of the vector batch produced, and shipping requirements. Institutions would also be wise to consider sourcing research-grade vector preparations (often at a cost of less than $50,000) to enable development work and early validation activities before transitioning to a GMP-grade preparation for final validation runs.",
        "POC manufacturing requires a highly skilled technical team with a working knowledge of aseptic techniques, clinical-grade reagents, and a variety of release assays to prove a product is suitable for use in humans. With automated POC platforms, the challenges presented by release tests are often more difficult to overcome than the actual manufacturing. This is further complicated when fresh CAR T products are desired, as a large QC team is required to perform STAT PCR testing of vector copy number, replication competent virus and mycoplasma, STAT flow cytometric testing of percent transduced cells and other cell types, along with other release tests such as endotoxin. Unfortunately, finding, training, and retaining skilled personnel is increasingly becoming a challenge for academic institutions. Creative workforce recruitment and training approaches are needed to expand the workforce to meet the demand. Infrastructure in the form of GMP-compliant lab space, procurement of additional space and external equipment will present a significant cost burden. To help in this effort, newer manufacturing platforms aim to remove this drawback and make operation in a lower-class environment possible (39) In essence, use of a closed production platform outside of a clean room is dependent on the classification of the space and the validation performed by the manufacturing staff demonstrating that the risk of contamination is mitigated to the same degree as if the product were being processed in a clean room environment (e.g., through technologist best practices, aseptic technique, environmental monitoring). Though regulations differ between countries, to our knowledge there are no regulations that prohibit the use of closed production platforms outside of a cleanroom if manufacturing practices are properly validated and documented.",
        "Quality control is one of the greatest challenges to implementing POC manufacturing as opposed to centralized manufacturing. While the centralized manufacturing system has a well-organized QA system, the challenge with decentralized system is that we may have facilities that are technically capable for its production but not experienced with the QA and regulatory aspects of GMP manufacturing. POC manufacturing necessitates a strong quality program at the site, particularly in the absence of quality program support from a commercial entity. For trials to move into the clinic, the manufacturing institution needs to possess professional knowledge of federal regulations and a robust team to handle information requests during the regulatory review process (39). For fresh CAR T products, a QA team that is knowledgeable and comfortable with the manufacturing process and QC tests is important to achieve a thorough but rapid batch record review and product release, as sampling, harvesting and distribution are typically performed over a 24 h time frame with a goal of infusing on first shift (68, 69). We summarize the important components required for setting up a GMP clean room in Table 4.",

        "In the case of distributed, POC manufacturing, it would be incumbent upon the sponsor of the trial to oversee and continuously monitor (via audits and on-site visits) the operations and quality management at individual manufacturing sites. All documents would be subject to central review by the sponsoring company/entity. However, it is likely the quality agreement (which must be in place before manufacturing begins) would outsource real-time release testing results review and product sign-out to the POC manufacturing center, whose quality management system and leadership would have been thoroughly audited by the sponsor. Before trial initiation, technology transfer activities and verification studies would provide documentation of comparability in production and release testing methods across sites. Once the trial began, continuous communication and quality audits would protect against deviations and drift in critical quality attributes.",
        "Financing POC manufacturing remains a challenge. Innovative approaches will be necessary to disseminate this approach. For example, the Biologics License Application FDA mechanism could allow a network of centers to produce CAR T cells, under the basic assumption that the process would be verifiable and similar in all production facilities, which would in turn market the product for sale. Another intriguing possibility is to seek institutional licensing similarly to what has been done with cord blood banks in the USA.",
        "Toxicity profiles play an important role in the feasibility of in-house developed and manufactured products. Commercially available products have extensive documentation and a detailed spectrum of possible toxicities like cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. It is expected that POC manufactured products will have such extensive documentation. Most importantly, if more than one center is to provide locally manufactured CAR T cells, all participating laboratories will have to show the same standard and comparable results, including similar release tests. The almost universal use of lymphodepleting agents like cyclophosphamide and fludarabine prior to the use of CAR T cells also significantly affects the toxicity profile. These potential responses require robust clinical and quality teams to monitor reactions.",
        "Several academic institutions have started producing in-house products, like Case Western Reserve University Hospital (CWRU/UH) in Cleveland, Ohio, Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Stanford, Palo Alto, California have utilized the CliniMACS platform using a lentiviral vector (13, 15, 32, 59). At CWRU/UH experience, 100% manufacturing success of anti-CD19 CAR T cells was achieved in 24 patients with median time from apheresis to infusion of 13 days. Similar efficacy and toxicity with other FDA approved CAR T cells products was observed (32, 59) At MCW and Stanford, POC manufacturing has been used in clinical trials of bispecific CAR T cells, including patients who had failed previous anti-CD19 CAR T cells, and they have shown feasibility with promising efficacy without safety signals concerns (13, 15) Twenty-six anti-CD19/CD20 CAR T cell products were manufactured using a fixed 14 days process in the CliniMACS Prodigy device. The target dose of CAR T cells was achieved in 85% of patients (22 of 26), with 100% successful manufacturing in CAR-naive patients (15) Similarly, the Ohio State University team is using the same platform to produce CD19/CD20/CD22 CAR T cells in 6–7 days to support a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05418088) (70).",
        "Globally, production of CAR T cells is challenging. Different countries have different regulatory pathways, which adds to the challenge of having a single uniform international regulatory standard. Despite this, some countries have developed innovative approaches for POC production.",
        "For instance, in Spain, a national network of hospitals was established for production of CD19-specific CAR T cells used in the treatment of relapsed ALL that resulted in approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). On the Spanish group pivotal clinical trial, 54 patients underwent apheresis with 87% of success in CAR T cell manufacture. The median vein-to-vein time was not yet shorter than centralized manufactured products, mostly due to 7 patients who required 2 apheresis and numerous intervening medical complications that forced delays to start lymphodepleting chemotherapy and cell infusion (38).",
        "In China, authorities have encouraged small start-up companies to produce these products in direct collaboration with a clinical center (71). Through this partnership and decentralized CAR T cells manufacture, there are over 500 Chinese clinical trials registered aiming to improve CAR T cells manufacture efficiency and efficacy. An example is provided by Nanjing Biolegend with its anti-BCMA CAR T cell for multiple myeloma, now approved by FDA and promising data from early phase clinical trials with anti-claudin CAR T cells in gastrointestinal malignancies (4, 18, 71).",
        "Similarly centers in Germany, Israel, India, and Brazil have started introducing the concept of POC production, with some clear challenges remaining to full access. For instance, Palani et al. in India have demonstrated production of CAR T cells using the ClinicMACS platform, but no patients have been treated due to the limitation of financial assistance. All the above centers have laid foundation for middle income countries to begin discussions about setting up research labs, thereby enhancing the global acceptance of this novel product (24, 30, 72).",
        "Early-stage CAR T cell products were initially funded by government institutions or philanthropic societies. The next generation of CAR T products should reach all countries, regardless of national income or funding abilities. As mentioned by Lam and collaborators in the United Kingdom, decentralized manufacturing can be quite cost effective, particularly if multiple smaller units are set up in a common geographical area, thereby allowing equipment and personnel to be better utilized at a local level (29). Sharing resources between multiple hospitals could benefit a larger population by easy accessibility to these products. Likewise, partnerships with pharmaceutical suppliers would more readily facilitate hospital-based studies and clinical trials for production of genetically modified products in a cost-effective manner. Indeed, biotech companies are beginning to appreciate the advantages of POC manufacturing and are working to roll out their manufacturing and testing platforms to select academic centers with the goal of commercializing with regional manufacturing centers around the world (15, 32, 38).",
        "Healthcare legislation underpins all modern research and technology. To expand the use of cell and gene therapies across the world, especially in low-income areas, a uniform code of practice should be formulated to ensure adequate quality of production of these products in a safe environment. Legislation is necessary to ensure protection from unethical and harmful practices, particularly when such regulations have not been codified before. An individual's right to permit the use of his or her own cells must always be protected. The adoption of the WHO concept of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) where “all communities can use promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative services they need while ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user to financial hardships” is an essential step in expanding therapeutic access and enabling high-quality research (73).",
        "Given the high cost of production and delivery limiting therapeutic use in various countries, resource allocation will play an essential role in implementing a therapeutic program in emerging markets. An important concept of the ICER, or incremental cost-effective ratio, serves as a basis for considering an intervention as good value for money. Using this concept, various programs in Africa for treating hemophilia and providing cancer chemotherapy have reached a wider network of patients (74) This concept can be easily applied to cell and gene therapy by implementing POC manufacturing in targeted geographical areas and appropriate demographic areas that will provide maximum benefits for patients (75).",
        "Current CAR T cell product prices ranges anywhere between USD $373,000 to $475,000 which is unaffordable in most nations (29, 30, 76) The use of decentralized production will be beneficial in such scenarios where pharmaceutical production will not be profitable. Also, the use of partnerships between low- and medium-income nations mat achieve a balance between cost-effectiveness and affordability. An example of this partnership is seen between South Africa and India where two biotech companies are providing services of their genetic therapies at a tenfold lower price (74, 76).",
        "Capacity building mainly includes strengthening the workforce. The administration and production of these products need a strong local workforce. Collaborations between different countries mainly for training and education is extremely important. Various universities have increased scholarships for students from low-income nations. An initiative started by the South-African government is the BM-NHSP (Bongani Mayosi National Health Scholars Program) where students are trained in genetic and cellular therapy (74). A similar initiative was started by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with the NIH (National Institutes of Health) that supports genetic therapy in under-resourced nations. To fully capitalize on decentralization, training of skilled workers in high-technology equipment production and maintenance at a local level is essential to ensure high quality therapeutic use and patient care. As enumerated above, these modifications will help in maintaining a high quality of research worldwide and will help countries reap the benefits of genetically modified agents that were once considered unavailable to them.",
        "POC manufacturing is a promising approach to expand the availability and utilization of CAR T cell therapies worldwide in a both time- and cost-effective manner. While there are several obstacles to overcome (e.g., availability of vectors, personnel training, lack of facilities), several initiatives are underway to address these issues. In addition, stringent regulatory oversight is required to maintain the quality and reproducibility of these products worldwide. Likewise, academic-pharmaceutical partnerships will be necessary to promote future research and innovation in the field.",

        "More than a century after the “magic bullet” concept was developed by the German Nobel laureate Paul Ehrlich and decades after the development of the first gene-manipulated T cells expressing chimeric receptors (that could redirect their cytotoxic effects towards cancer cells of interest), these two phenomena blended to be one of the most promising anticancer therapeutics known as chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T cells or CAR-Ts). In detail, the magic bullet theory proposed that it might be feasible to specifically eliminate invading elements in the body without damaging healthy organs (similar to a bullet fired from a weapon to hit a distinct target) [1]. CAR-Ts proudly stepped into the clinic arenas with Kymriah™ (Tisagenlecleucel) and Tecartus™ (Brexucabtagene autoleucel) being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), respectively, while Yescarta™ (Axicabtagene ciloleucel) and Breyanzi™ (Lisocabtagene maraleucel) are approved for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Furthermore, in March 2021, FDA approved Abecma™ (Idecabtagene vicleucel) for the treatment of adult patients with R/R multiple myeloma (MM) [118][117]. However, some hematologic malignancy or even solid tumor patients might have yet to benefit from the therapeutic effects of CAR-Ts. The complicated nature of the tumor microenvironments (TME) has limited the tumoricidal capacity of CAR-Ts in the case of solid tumors. One of the hurdles is associated with the antigens that have a poor density on the respective tumor cells or simply the loss of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Some researchers have expressed the CD19 antigen on the surface of particular CD19-negative solid tumor cells using oncolytic viruses to render these cells susceptible to being targeted by CD19-redirected CAR-Ts (CD19.CAR-Ts), and they have reported encouraging results [7]. Other strategies such as the utilization of boosting vaccines designed to overcome the issue of poor CAR-T stimulation and persistence have also proven to be rather encouraging [8,9]. In the case of tumor heterogeneity, some researchers have engineered CAR-Ts that secrete bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) that engage bystander T cells against the heterogeneous tumor, thus enforcing a stronger tumor rejection [10]. Of note, not all BiTEs are secretory as Blinatumomab (an FDA-approved CD19/CD3-bispecific BiTE used for the treatment of R/R B-ALL) is administered intravenously [11,12]. Additionally, to fight against the immunosuppressive nature of TMEs, Osborne et al. have investigated (NCT03287817) the effect of administrating the anti-PD-1 antibody Pembrolizumab, whereas others have used gene-editing techniques such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN®) or CRISPR-Cas9 to develop immunosuppression-resistant effector cells (such as those deficient in the expression of NR4A transcription factors) [13], [14], [15]. In a slightly different approach, Ping et al. have developed CAR-Ts that secret PD-1-neutralizing scFvs that counteract immunosuppression [16]. To address the poor CAR-T infiltration issue, researchers have demonstrated that the expression of particular receptors such as CXCR1/2, CCR4, and CCR2b, might be beneficial in helping leverage particular tumor-secreted molecules for the redirection of CAR-Ts towards the tumors themselves [17], [18], [19], [20]. Another reasonable approach is the regional delivery of CAR-Ts, rather than their systemic administration, which has recently shown promising outcomes in the case of peritoneal carcinomatosis, brain-metastasized breast cancer, and medulloblastoma [21], [22], [23]. To amplify the antitumor effects of CAR-Ts, some investigators have evaluated the effects of preconditioning interleukins (IL), such IL-15 or IL-7, and have reported slightly positive effects such as the increased sensitivity of CAR-Ts to immune-checkpoint blockade regimens [24,25]. However, since such systemic administrations might result in the stimulation of non-transduced lymphocytes leading to unwanted toxicities, some researchers have engineered CAR-Ts that secrete particular ILs such as IL-23 or IL-2 receptor that can operate in an autocrine fashion, thus less likely to mediate toxicities [26,27]. The disappearance of CAR-Ts from the circulation of patients has also been observed in clinical trials which might be due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies reactive with the animal-originated targeting domains of CAR-Ts. To fully benefit from the therapeutic impact of CAR-Ts, humanized or fully human targeting domains have been implemented in CAR constructs, and they have exhibited promising clinical outcomes [28], [29], [30]. Some researchers have also used “AND” or “NOT” gates to limit the unfavorable effects of CAR-Ts on healthy tissues and have reported limited success in proof-of-concept studies [116][5]. However, the implementation of such gates requires definitive antigen sets restricted to only healthy or tumor cells [116][5]. Besides all these elaborate strategies [116][5,[31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]], the need for introducing novel TAAs is fiercely sensed. In this review, we briefly summarize the recent clinical success of several novel antigen-redirected CAR-Ts (Tables 1 and 2) from some of which clinical evaluations have been released, so far. Furthermore, we take a peek at the experimental success of some other novel antigen-targeting CAR-Ts that are currently under laboratory investigation alongside proposing several novel antigens that have not yet been targeted by CAR-Ts.Table 1Some of the CAR-T therapy target antigens that are currently or planned to be under clinical investigation.

        "From the early days of CAR-T therapy until today, numerous antigens, including CD19, CD20, CD22, BCMA, GD2, Mesothelin, TAG-72, CEA, EGFR, B7H3, HER2, IL13Ra2, MUC1, EpCAM, PSMA, PSCA, NKG2D, and various others, have been targeted by CAR-Ts in clinical trials that can now be dubbed “traditional CAR-T targets” [5,32,35,37,38]. In contrast, the future of CAR-T therapy might be slightly leaning towards different antigens for some of which multiple clinical trials have been conducted in recent years and their outcomes are either concisely discussed in the next section or expected in the years to come. Also, in the upcoming section, we briefly discuss several other novel antigens targeted by CAR-Ts that are still under experimental development, and next we explore the suitability of possible future CAR-T targets (Fig. 1). Also, Fig. 2 details the obstacles that a given CAR-T product targeting a novel antigen should overcome on its way towards approval for medical use.Fig. 1An overall representation of the novel antigens discussed in this review and the overlapping involvement of some of them in different oncological indications. The ovals in the center represent different types of cancers. AML, acute myeloid leukemia; CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; MM, multiple myeloma; RCC, renal cell carcinoma; T-ALL, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; T-NHL, non-Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma.Fig. 1Fig. 2The “hard-to-survive” journey of a proposed CAR-T product redirected against a novel antigen from antigen discovery to the approval of the product for medical use by the US FDA. The journey starts with the discovery of the novel antigen. Next, scientists should develop a high-affinity mAb or CasMab specific for that antigen (using hybridoma, phage-display, ribosome display, etc. techniques). In the next step, the mAb can be engineered as the targeting domain of CAR-Ts. Fully human or humanized mAbs should be preferred over murine mAbs since highly immunogenic CAR targeting domains might encounter neutralizing antibodies in the prospective recipients following CAR-T administration. This phenomenon could lead to the elimination of the infused CAR-Ts from the patient's body and consequent abrogation of all CAR-T-related antitumor effects. After achieving success in broad and meticulous experiments (both in vitro and in vivo) and finding the willing sponsor(s), the investigators can take steps towards primary clinical assessments (Phase 0) in a limited number of subjects using subtherapeutic doses. This step is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the proposed CAR-T product in human subjects (rather than preclinical animal models that provide findings that might not be that translatable in clinics). Phase 0 helps pharmaceutical companies to alleviate their doubt about similar products and go to Phase I with the best choice. Next, the proposed CAR-T product should be evaluated in a Phase I study (with 20–100 participants) in terms of its adverse events, safety index, and tolerable doses. After dose determination and demonstration of safety, the proposed CAR-T product can be investigated in a Phase II trial (with a larger population of enrolled patients). This step is conducted for a broader determination of safety alongside investigating therapeutic efficacy. After a successful Phase II, a Phase III trial could be conducted to gauge the definitive therapeutic efficacy of the CAR-T product and, if successful, it can be granted FDA approval for the intended oncological indication. After obtaining permission for medical use, a Phase IV trial might be conducted for monitoring long-term or uncommon side effects of the product.

        "The “hard-to-survive” journey of a proposed CAR-T product redirected against a novel antigen from antigen discovery to the approval of the product for medical use by the US FDA. The journey starts with the discovery of the novel antigen. Next, scientists should develop a high-affinity mAb or CasMab specific for that antigen (using hybridoma, phage-display, ribosome display, etc. techniques). In the next step, the mAb can be engineered as the targeting domain of CAR-Ts. Fully human or humanized mAbs should be preferred over murine mAbs since highly immunogenic CAR targeting domains might encounter neutralizing antibodies in the prospective recipients following CAR-T administration. This phenomenon could lead to the elimination of the infused CAR-Ts from the patient's body and consequent abrogation of all CAR-T-related antitumor effects. After achieving success in broad and meticulous experiments (both in vitro and in vivo) and finding the willing sponsor(s), the investigators can take steps towards primary clinical assessments (Phase 0) in a limited number of subjects using subtherapeutic doses. This step is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the proposed CAR-T product in human subjects (rather than preclinical animal models that provide findings that might not be that translatable in clinics). Phase 0 helps pharmaceutical companies to alleviate their doubt about similar products and go to Phase I with the best choice. Next, the proposed CAR-T product should be evaluated in a Phase I study (with 20–100 participants) in terms of its adverse events, safety index, and tolerable doses. After dose determination and demonstration of safety, the proposed CAR-T product can be investigated in a Phase II trial (with a larger population of enrolled patients). This step is conducted for a broader determination of safety alongside investigating therapeutic efficacy. After a successful Phase II, a Phase III trial could be conducted to gauge the definitive therapeutic efficacy of the CAR-T product and, if successful, it can be granted FDA approval for the intended oncological indication. After obtaining permission for medical use, a Phase IV trial might be conducted for monitoring long-term or uncommon side effects of the product.

        "Placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP, or alternatively known as ALPP) is a human metalloenzyme normally expressed in the placenta and testis but overexpressed in a wide spectrum of malignancies including ovarian and cervical cancer, colon adenocarcinomas, teratomas, and seminomas [39,40]. Furthermore, PLAP has also been evident to be incorporated in the membrane of non-small cell lung cancer patients’ exosomes, branding it as a novel prognostic target [39,40]. In 2020, Li et al. generated PLAP-redirected CAR-Ts (PLAP.CAR-Ts) that harbored murine or humanized PLAP-specific scFvs as targeting domains that exhibited high selectivity towards PLAP-positive colon cancer cells [39,40]. Moreover, the humanized PLAP.CAR-Ts significantly inhibited tumor growth in PLAP-positive colon cancer cell xenograft models [39,40]. Li et al. also demonstrated that combination therapy with checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1, PD-L1, or LAG-3 inhibitors, can significantly increase the therapeutic force of humanized PLAP.CAR-Ts against colorectal cancer [39,40]. Of note, in December 2020, a clinical trial (NCT04627740) started with 20 participants to investigate the clinical efficacy of ALPP-redirected CAR-Ts.",
        "Signaling lymphocytic-activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7), also known as CS1, CD319, or CRACC, is a surface glycoprotein that, despite its low-level expression on a spectrum of immune cells including natural killer cells (NKs) and particular subsets of T cells, is highly and uniformly expressed in MM [41]. In this regard, SLAMF7 might be considered a candidate for an immunotherapy target antigen [41]. In the bone marrow, SLAMF7 has been known to contribute to the adhesion and viability of malignant plasma cells (mPCs) [42]. In 2014, Chu et al. generated second-generation CS1-redirected CAR-Ts (CS1.CAR-Ts) and reported that these cells exhibited potent tumoricidal effects against CS1-positive MM cells which coincided with CD69 upregulation and elevated levels of INF-γ and IL-2 [41]. Furthermore, upon CS1.CAR-Ts administration into MM.1S and IM9 MM human xenograft mouse models, the CAR-Ts mediated considerable tumor rejection that resulted in the induction of prolonged survival [41]. In another study, Danhof et al. generated SLAMF7-redirected CAR-Ts (SLAMF7.CAR-Ts) and reported that, besides the pronounced anti-myeloma efficacy of these cells, a single administration of them would suffice to induce prolonged survival by medullary and extramedullary myeloma eradication in xenograft MM models [42,43]. Additionally, these researchers concluded that even though SLAMF7.CAR-T-mediated fratricide of SLAMF7-positive normal lymphocyte subsets (including NK cells, CD4-positive and CD8-positive T cells, and B cells) did not impede the preparation process of SLAMF7.CAR-Ts, it might promote acute cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or contribute to viral infections (which might be clinically manageable via lymphodepleting regimens or antiviral prophylaxis, respectively, as proposed by Danhof and colleagues) [42,43]. In 2017, using TALEN® gene-editing technology, Mathur et al. developed off-the-shelf double knock-out universal CS1.CAR-Ts (UniCS1.CAR-Ts), deficient in the expression of TRAC and SLAMF7, as a strategy to tackle fratricide and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [44]. In detail, upon encountering primary MM tumor cells, allogeneic UniCS1.CAR-Ts expanded and secreted elevated levels of IFN-γ and GM-CSF and subsequently exerted pronounced cytolytic responses against MM tumor cells, both in vitro and in vivo\n[44]. In 2018, Wang et al. conducted an experiment to investigate the impact of lenalidomide on the phenotype and effector function of second-generation CS1.CAR-Ts in vitro and in MM tumor-bearing mice [45]. Lenalidomide is an FDA-approved immunomodulatory agent used for the treatment of MM (either with or without dexamethasone) [46]. In vitro findings attributed the enhanced anti-myeloma capacity, memory maintenance, and Th1 cytokine secretion to the lenalidomide treatment of CS1.CAR-Ts alongside in vivo data indicating that lenalidomide might amplify the tumoricidal impact and persistence of CS1.CAR-Ts [45]. Alongside highlighting the possible therapeutic importance of CS1, these findings might accentuate the benefits of using combinatorial therapy for relapsed myeloma [45]. In 2020, Amatya et al. equipped their SLAMF7.CAR-Ts with an inducible caspase 9-based suicide switch that could trigger at-will elimination of the effector cells following the introduction of the dimerizing drug AP1903 (rimiducid), upon feeling the need [47]. In detail, the adoptive transfer of these SLAMF7.CAR-Ts into mouse models resulted in the efficient eradication of SLAMF7-positive tumors, and also the rapid elimination of the effector cells was achieved via the administration of AP1903 [47]. Eventually, Zah et al. elaborately designed and generated B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)/CS1 bispecific CAR-Ts (BCMA/CS1.CAR-Ts) as a possible option to fight against heterogeneous MM [48]. In comparison to engineered T cells individually co-expressing BCMA and CS1 CARs, BCMA/CS1.CAR-Ts exhibited superior characteristics in terms of tumoricidal activity [48]. Furthermore, even though in vivo complete tumor eradication and durable remission via the combination of BCMA/CS1.CAR-Ts and anti-PD-1 antibodies required a shorter timeline, compared with CAR-T therapy alone, it did not impact the overall durability of response [48].",
        "Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2), the stomach-specific claudin 18 (CLDN18) isoform, is a membrane-bound protein that has been associated with various types of cancers including gastric cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma [49,50]. In 2019, Jiang et al. developed the first CLDN18.2-redirected CAR-Ts (CLDN18.2.CAR-Ts), which harbored CLDN18.2-specific humanized single-chain variable fragments (scFv) as targeting domains, and investigated their tumoricidal capacity in patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models and BGC-823 cell-bearing gastric cancer mouse models [50]. The findings indicated no serious signs of CAR-T-mediated adverse events on the healthy tissues of the animal models despite the CLDN18.2.CAR-T-mediated antitumor responses against the tumor cells expressing the murine form of CLDN18.2 [50]. Eventually, Zhan et al. conducted the first-in-human Phase I pilot study (NCT03159819) to assess the safety and tumoricidal capacity of autologous CLDN18.2.CAR-Ts in 12 patients with CLDN18.2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma (7 with advanced gastric and 5 with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had fludarabine- and cyclophosphamide-induced lymphodepletion prior to CAR-T administration) [51]. In the first report, no serious CAR-T-mediated unfavorable side effects, severe neurotoxicity, or treatment-related mortality was documented, except for a decline in lymphocytes and neutrophils, as well as grade 1/2 CRS, which could lead to the conclusion that CLDN18.2.CAR-Ts might be well-tolerated by patients [51]. With the total objective rate of 33% and 1 complete remission (CR), 3 partial remissions (PR), 5 stable diseases, and 2 disease progressions out of 11 patients eligible for response assessment, it might be moderate to assert that advanced gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients might be the beneficiaries of the therapeutic potential of CLDN18.2.CAR-Ts, as a possible treatment option [51]. Additionally, smart strategies have also been conducted to overcome the limitation of poor in vivo stimulation of CAR-Ts, which is mainly due to the inaccessibility of the effector cells to their target antigen. In 2020, Zhu et al. developed a nanoparticle-based RNA vaccine that acts as a carrier for the delivery of the natively-folded Claudin 6 (CLDN6), as the target antigen of CLDN6-redirected CAR-Ts (CLDN6.CAR-Ts), to the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) residing in lymphoid compartments [9]. Involved in tight-junction structure, CLDN6 is a membrane-spanning protein whose expression has been frequently associated with several cancers including uterine, ovarian, testicular, and lung adenocarcinoma [9,52]. Theoretically, the adoptively transferred CLDN6.CAR-Ts should expand more efficiently upon encountering their target antigen after they traffic into lymphoid compartments and interact with the relative APCs [9]. In vivo findings have indicated that using this method, lower CLDN6.CAR-T doses are required to induce tumor rejection in large-tumor-bearing animal models [9]. Additionally, alongside CAR-T modalities, other elaborate anticancer strategies such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) or CLDN/CD3-bispecific antibodies might also be taken into consideration as possible options for the treatment of CLDN-positive gastric and pancreatic cancer (as experimental evidence has validated their potential in the case of CLDN18.2) [53].",
        "FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3, also known as CD135) is a cytokine receptor of the receptor tyrosine kinase class III which is expressed on the surface of malignant blasts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells [54]. In 2018, Jetani et al. demonstrated that FLT3- or FLT3 with internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)-expressing cell lines of MOLM-13, THP-1, and MV-4-11 and primary AML blasts can be selectively eliminated using FLT3-redirected CAR-Ts (FLT3.CAR-Ts) [54]. Moreover, they elucidated that the FLT3-inhibitor crenolanib can promote the expression of FLT3 by AML cells which consequently facilitates their targeting by FLT3.CAR-Ts [54]. One of the potential explanations for this phenomenon might be that AML blasts elevate FLT3 expression as a resistance mechanism to tackle the inhibitory impacts of FLT3 inhibitors [55], [56], [57]. Numerous distinct mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the emergence of resistance to different FLT3 inhibitors including mutations (such as the tyrosine kinase domain-related K429E and F691L mutations that mediate resistance to crenolanib), elevated FLT3 ligand expression, intracellular pH decline, or even amplified expression of oncogenic kinases [58]. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, since CAR-Ts require the establishment of a high number of immunological synapses (approximately 150 antigen engagements for each CAR-T) to be cytotoxically activated against their target cells, the crenolanib-induced elevation in the surface expression of FLT3 could be exploited for antitumor purposes [59]. One of the twists of using FLT3.CAR-Ts is the requirement of eliminating the adoptively transferred FLT3.CAR-Ts after treatment completion and reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment of the patients using allogeneic HSC transplantation (since FLT3.CAR-Ts are incapable of discriminating between healthy HSCs and malignant AML blasts) [54].",
        "Selective elimination of CAR-Ts can be achieved using caspase-, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK)-, and monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based safety switches [116][5]. Numerous clinical trials (NCT02146924, NCT01865617, NCT02159495, NCT01953900, NCT02414269, etc.) are currently evaluating the clinical applicability of these safety switches which might be completed in the upcoming years. According to a report focusing on 5 patients from a clinical trial with 10 enrolled participants (NCT00710892), 5 patients with relapsed acute leukemia that had received stem-cell transplantation underwent a treatment of inducible caspase 9 (iCasp9)-equipped T cells for immune restoration [60]. In detail, 4 out of 5 patients (80%) that had developed GVHD received a single dose of AP1903 administration that led to the elimination of a high proportion (>90%) of the infused T cells in half an hour [60]. Also, the signs of GVHD commenced disappearing one day after AP1903 administration without re-emergence [60]. According to a long-term follow-up of the same trial in all of the 10 enrolled patients, the effects of this safety switch on GVHD happens to be in a permanent fashion [61]. Moreover, there have not yet been any reports regarding the possible immunogenicity of this safety switch which might be a result of this switch being based on a gene encoding human caspase [62]. Also, the dimerizing agent used in this setting has been considered to be non-toxic, so far [62]. In regards to mAb-based switches, despite their acceptable capacity in managing CAR-T-mediated toxicities, the unhinged biodistribution of the administered mAbs might be one of their downsides as it might result in mild to severe toxicities towards healthy tissues [63], [64], [65]. Such mentioned switches also lack a preventive strategy that could be used against them in the cases of unforeseen toxicities caused by the switches themselves. Moreover, the HSV-TK switch has encountered immune responses in patients due to its immunogenicity (owing to its viral origin) [66]. Such immune responses correlated with the rapid elimination of the infused T cells harboring this safety switch [66]. As briefed, safety switches have their advantages and disadvantages, all of which might be elucidated as the related clinical trials are completed.",
        "In comparison with the study mentioned earlier in which the investigators had derived their CAR targeting domain from the FLT3-specific mAb 4G8, Wang et al. developed slightly different CAR-Ts (named FLT3L.CAR-Ts) that harbored the FLT3 binding domain of FLT3L, known as FLT3L-BD, as their targeting domains [54,67]. In vitro findings indicated that FLT3L.CAR-Ts exhibited more pronounced tumoricidal effects against FLT3-ITD-expressing malignant blasts, rather than FLT3-positive ones, and negligible cytolytic effects against healthy CD34-positive umbilical cord blood stem cells [67]. Moreover, the induction of long-term survival achieved in xenograft AML mice might further validate the potential antitumor capacity of ligand-based FLT3-specific CAR-Ts [67]. To expand the applicability of FLT3.CAR-Ts and abrogate their toxicities towards HSCs and progenitor cells, Sommer et al. equipped their off-the-shelf scFv-based FLT3.CAR-Ts with a rituximab-dependent safety switch, and indicated that not only the selective depletion of these CAR-Ts does not impede AML remission, but it also facilitates the hematopoietic system recovery [68]. These findings might pave the way for the possible clinical assessment of off-the-shelf FLT3.CAR-Ts in FLT3-positive hematologic malignancies, inclusive of AML [68]. Other treatment strategies based on the FLT3 antigen such as FLT3/CD3 bispecific antibodies might shine more light on the importance and suitability of this antigen in cancer immunotherapy [69]. Of note, FLT3/CD3 bispecific antibodies have also exhibited therapeutic potential in cynomolgus monkeys by inducing the complete eradication of FLT3-positive dendritic cells (DCs) [69].",
        "CD7 might be considered as a potential target for the immunotherapy of patients with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). To our knowledge, Zhang et al. conducted the first-in-human clinical trial (NCT04004637) that investigated the therapeutic efficacy of autologous nanobody-based CD7-redirected CAR-Ts (CD7.CAR-Ts) in patients with R/R T-LBL/T-ALL [70]. Moreover, since the administration of such CAR-Ts might result in CAR-T fratricide, they developed an elaborate strategy that anchors CD7 in the ER and/or Golgi of these cells as a strategy to tackle the issue of fratricide [70]. In detail, CRS with elevated levels of IL-6 was observed in all three CD4- and CD8-negative T-LBL/T-ALL patients (who had undergone lymphodepletion with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide prior to CD7.CAR-T infusion) which might indicate that the tolerability index of CD7.CAR-Ts is acceptable [70]. Moreover, the therapeutic efficacy of CD7.CAR-Ts was later confirmed as two of the patients achieved minimal residual disease (MDR)-negative CR and the other experienced a considerable decline in the number of abnormal T cells after the treatment [70]. In a different approach, Gehrke et al. generated allogeneic second-generation CD7.CAR-Ts that are almost resistant to GVHD and/or fratricide or do not encounter immune rejection and/or immunosuppression [71]. In detail, they used novel gene-editing reagents, called “base editors (BE)”, that create single-base DNA changes without causing hazardous genomic rearrangements [71]. The mentioned CD7.CAR-Ts were tumoricidal in animal tumor models in a dose-dependent fashion alongside exhibiting pronounced in vitro antitumor effects and cytokine secretion in response to tumor cell antigen-engagement [71]. Taken together, alongside enabling simultaneous base editing at desired genomic loci, the use of such flexible multiplexed base editing methods might expedite advancing towards clinical evaluation with CD7.CAR-Ts that are universally patient-compatible for the treatment of CD7-positive malignancies [71]. According to another report from two open-labeled clinical trials (ChiCTR190002531 and ISRCTN19144142) evaluating the safety index and antitumor potential of a single infusion of “off-the-shelf” allogeneic CD7.CAR-Ts, called GC027, in two lymphodepleted patients with R/R T-ALL, the patients achieved MRD-negative CR, with one of them remaining disease-free even one year after the treatment [72]. Even though the report indicated no signs of GVHD, grade 3 CRS was observed in both of the patients which was subsequently resolved using ruxolitinib [72]. All of the mentioned reports point out the fact that it might require further clinical evaluations with broader R/R T-LBL or T-ALL patient populations to determine the safety index and therapeutic potential of CD7.CAR-Ts.",
        "CD5 is abundantly present in several T-cell malignancies, alongside being expressed by normal T cells, therefore, it might be considered as a likely candidate for a CAR-T therapy target antigen [73,74]. In this regard, Hill et al. conducted a Phase I dose-escalation study (NCT03081910) to investigate the safety and applicability of autologous second-generation CD5-redirected CAR-Ts (CD5.CAR-Ts) in 21 patients with R/R non-Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma (T-NHL) [73]. According to a 2020 report presenting the findings from only 5 of the patients of the mentioned trial (who had undergone lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to CD5.CAR-T infusion, which consisted of fludarabine/cyclophosphamide), 3 out of 5 patients (60%) achieved CR [73]. Furthermore, CRS was reported to be observed in 3 of the patients (60%) for the resolution of which tocilizumab and other related clinical considerations were taken into account [73]. Since the complete clinical evaluations of CD5.CAR-T trials have not yet been publicly released, in the upcoming years, it will be elucidated whether this type of therapy might be able to offer acceptable clinical outcomes (with rather manageable toxicities) to T-cell malignancy patients [73]. However, CD5-based immunotherapies could also be intertwined with off-tumor toxicities due to the expression of CD5 by a subclass of B cells called B-1a cells [75]. Since B-1a cells play key roles in the fight against opportunistic bacterial (such as streptococcal infections) and viral infections, their unwanted elimination renders patients susceptible to life-threatening conditions [75,76]. To overcome this limitation, patients undergoing CD5-based immunotherapies might require to be under meticulous clinical care in a sterile environment alongside undergoing immunoglobulin replacement (obtained from healthy donors) after treatment completion [5,77].",
        "Despite the clinical success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients, complete disease regression has been out of reach due to the incapability of TKIs in the elimination of the quiescent leukemia stem cells (LSCs) [78]. Moreover, despite the targeting of IL-1RAP, CD33, CD44, and CD123 using CAR-Ts, only IL-1RAP-redirected CAR-Ts have been able to target CML LSCs [79]. In addition to the mentioned antigens, experimental evidence has confirmed the expression of CD26 (DPP IV) to be restricted to LSCs, basophils, and activated T cells [79]. Moreover, alongside TKI-insensitive CML LSCs and anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma, CD26-redirected CAR-Ts (CD26.CAR-Ts) might also be beneficial in the cases of renal cell carcinoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, and colorectal cancer [79]. In 2019, Zhou et al. developed CD26.CAR-Ts to investigate their antitumor capacity against CD26-positive cancer cells, but besides their poor viability, these cells were cytotoxic against themselves, due to the self-expression of CD26 [78]. In 2020, Zhou et al. stated that besides some off-tumor toxicity towards activated lymphocytes, CD26.CAR-Ts enhanced tumor rejection in a mouse model and they enforced tumoricidal effects against primary CML LSCs and the CD26-positive cell lines of K562 and Karpas 299 [79]. Furthermore, it was elucidated that the accelerated expansion of CD26.CAR-Ts, after fratricide-induced delayed expansion, correlated with the elevated expression of cathepsin B and SERPINB9 and reduced expression of CD26 [79].",
        "One of the alternative strategies for overcoming the limitations of CAR-T therapy in solid tumors is their redirection against the tumor vasculature, rather than the tumor cells [80]. In this regard, CLEC14A is recognized as an overexpressed tumor endothelial marker (TEM) whose physiological expression in normal endothelial cells is rather negligible [81]. It is worth mentioning that low shear stress might act as a contributing factor in elevating the expression level of CLEC14A by the tumor endothelial cells [82,83]. In 2020, Zhuang et al. indicated that CLEC14A-redirected CAR-Ts (CLEC14A.CAR-Ts) sufficiently proliferated, released IFN-γ, and enforced tumoricidal effects upon encountering their specific antigen, in vitro\n[80]. The intelligence behind the targeting of CLEC14A is that it is a glycoprotein whose expression is elevated in various human solid tumors [80]. Furthermore, the mouse models of mPDAC, Lewis lung carcinoma, and Rip-Tag2 exhibited considerable tumor rejection under the treatment of CLEC14A.CAR-Ts that coincided with tremendous downregulation of CLEC14A and significant disruption of the tumor vasculature system alongside showing “no signs of toxicity” [80]. These results might validate the feasibility of targeting the tumor vasculature, as an alternative approach, as well as highlight the applicability of CLEC14A as a likely immunotherapy target.",
        "Additionally, other investigators have also developed CAR-Ts that target different TEMs such as αvβ3 integrin, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 [84], [85], [86]. Besides reporting potential CAR-T-mediated tumor elimination in the mentioned studies, Chinnasamy and colleagues reported severe toxicities following the administration of VEGF-2-redirected CAR-Ts (2 × 107 T cells) in BALB/c mouse tumor models [85]. However, equivalent tumoricidal responses, but without the occurrence of toxicities, were achieved by simply lowering the administered dose of the CAR-Ts (down to 5 × 106 T cells) [85]. Regarding VEGFR2, in a clinical trial completed in 2015 (NCT01218867), only 1 out of 24 patients (about 4%) achieved a partial response [80]. Such poor clinical responses alongside the possibility of toxicities against the normal endothelium could raise serious concerns about the applicability of the alternative approach of targeting TEMs. Of note, CAR-Ts need to be safe and capable of inducing high rates of disease remission in patients to meet clinical standards for clinical approval.",
        "In the context of minimizing the unwanted damages of CAR-T therapy of epithelial cancers, delivered to healthy tissues as a result of targeting non-tumor-specific antigens, targeting of novel antigens is of paramount importance. Guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY2C), a regulator of intestinal homeostasis, is considered a cancer mucosa antigen overexpressed in around 90% of colorectal cancer , alongside other gastrointestinal malignancies [87,88]. The bright side of targeting GUCY2C is its inaccessibility in polarized epithelial tissue cells, due to its restriction to the apical membrane tight junctions, which minimizes the risks of intestinal toxicity while providing the opportunity of targeting metastatic colorectal lesions with disrupted apical-basolateral architecture [88,89]. In 2016, Magee et al. developed GUCY2C-redirected CAR-Ts (GUCY2C.CAR-Ts) targeting the murine homolog of GUCY2C, and they reported that GUCY2C.CAR-Ts successfully eliminated only GUCY2C-expressing mouse colorectal cancer cells while they spared GUCY2C-deficient cells [88]. As in vivo findings indicated, besides mediating no secondary adverse events towards healthy tissues, GUCY2C.CAR-Ts were able to enforce tumor rejection and increase the survival rates of colorectal cancer metastasis mouse models [88]. Additionally, in 2018 and as an attempt to target human GUCY2C-expressing metastases, Magee et al. developed GUCY2C.CAR-Ts equipped with a murine GUCY2C-specific targeting domain [89]. Alongside inducing prolonged survival in a syngeneic mouse model with lung metastases of human GUCY2C-expressing murine colorectal cancer cells, GUCY2C.CAR-Ts also induced durable survival in a human xenograft model by enforcing tumoricidal effects against GUCY2C-positive human colorectal cancer cells [89]. Also, in 2020, Baybutt et al. further confirmed the antitumor responses of third-generation GUCY2C.CAR-Ts, as indicated by elevated levels of TNF-α and INF-γ, against the metastatic colorectal cancer cell line T84 [90]. All these findings, alongside other therapeutic strategies, such as the application of anti-GUCY2C/CD3 BiTEs to recruit endogenous T cells against GUCY2C-expressing tumor cells, might highlight the importance of GUCY2C as a likely target of cancer immunotherapy [87]. However, the actual safety index and therapeutic efficacy of GUCY2C.CAR-Ts can only be determined in clinical trials with a broad population of patients with GUCY2C-positive oncological indications.",
        "In 2018, Byrd et al. asserted that TEM8-redirected CAR-Ts (TEM8.CAR-Ts) are capable of releasing immunostimulatory cytokines and enforcing cytotoxic effects that result in the elimination of TME8-positive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells alongside tumor endothelial cells [91]. Furthermore, tumor rejection by the elimination of TEM8-positive TNBC tumor cells and disruption of tumor vascularization were also observed in patient-derived and TNBC cell line-derived xenograft tumor models that received TEM8.CAR-T treatment [91]. However, Petrovic et al. reported considerably contrasting findings as the adoptive transfer of their TEM8.CAR-T panel, one of which harbored the same targeting domain as that of the Byrd et al. study, caused rapid toxicity and resulted in the absence of the TEM8.CAR-Ts from the circulation of healthy C57BL6 and NSG mice [92]. Moreover, further analysis of the animal models presented evidence of spleen and lung inflammation alongside attributing the loss of the TEM8.CAR-Ts from the circulation to the healthy-tissue targeting of TEM8 by TEM8.CAR-Ts [92]. Such contradictory findings accentuate the necessity for further meticulous preclinical experiments for assessing the suitability of TME8 as a likely immunotherapy target. Also, such reports demonstrate that preclinical studies should be interpreted cautiously. Furthermore, in 2019, Sotoudeh et al. conducted an in silico experiment to find suitable target antigens for the CAR-T therapy of gastric adenocarcinoma, with overexpression only in tumor tissues as a strategy to minimize off-tumor toxicities [93]. According to the results, alongside MSLN and MUC3A, TEM8 was also selected as a possible antigen for this aim, and it was suggested by the authors that simultaneous targeting of these antigens might result in the circumvention of resistance and improvement of CAR-T therapy outcomes [93]. However, since simultaneous targeting of multiple antigens might increase the risks of off-tumor toxicities, the practicality of such proposals might sometimes be questionable.",
        "Podoplanin (PDNP) is a mucin-like glycoprotein expressed in the renal, alveolar, and lymphatic endothelium, as well as in the basal skin cells [94]. Additionally, PDNP overexpression has been associated with various malignancies such as mesothelioma, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, and aggressive brain tumors such as mesenchymal glioblastoma [94]. In 2016, Shiina et al. developed third-generation PDPN-redirected CAR-Ts (PDPN.CAR-Ts), equipped with a PDPN-specific scFv called NZ-1, and reported that these cells mediated efficient tumoricidal responses against PDPN-positive glioblastoma cells, in vitro\n[95]. Moreover, the systemic administration of PDPN.CAR-Ts into a glioma mouse xenograft model managed to inhibit the growth of intracranial tumors [95]. Despite the success of PDPN.CAR-Ts in inducing tumor rejections in preclinical models, normal tissue expression of PDPN can lead to severe cases of off-tumor toxicities that might overshadow the applicability of PDPN.CAR-Ts in clinics. In this regard, Kato and Kaneko have developed a cancer-specific monoclonal antibody (CasMab), called LpMab-2, that can only react with the aberrantly glycosylated PDPN expressed by tumor tissues while being unreactive towards healthy-tissue PDPN [96]. The development of CAR constructs using LpMab-2, as the targeting tool, and genetically engineering T cells to express them will broaden the therapeutic applicability of PDPN.CAR-Ts since the adoptive transfer of such CAR-Ts might result in less immune-mediated toxicities. In our opinion, the utilization of CasMabs in the targeting domain of CAR constructs might be the most applicable and close-to-reality strategy for minimizing the off-tumor toxicities of CAR-Ts without creating complicated molecular twists that can only make it harder to meet clinical standards in the future.",
        "Protein Tyrosine Kinase 7 (PTK7) is a tyrosine kinase of the Wnt signaling pathway with possible activities in various cellular processes including proliferation, migration, adhesion, and programmed cell death [97]. High expression levels of PTK7, which is also known as colon cancer carcinoma kinase 4 (CCK-4), have been correlated with several solid tumors including pancreatic, lung, renal, breast, ovarian, and colon cancer [97]. A Phase I clinical trial (NCT02222922) has already been conducted to investigate the safety and tolerability of a PTK7-specific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), named PF-06647020, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TNBC, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (OVCA) patients [98]. PF-06647020 is linked with a cleavable linker to auristatin-0101, which itself is an auristatin microtubule inhibitor [98]. So far, clinically favorable responses have been observed in the OVCA patients with reasonable safety indications which warrant further clinical evaluations [98]. In 2020, Levitsky et al. generated allogeneic PTK7-redirected CAR-Ts (PTK7.CAR-Ts), and, after evaluating their antitumor capacity in vitro and in lung, pancreatic, colon, ovarian, and breast cancer xenograft mouse models, reported encouraging outcomes [98]. However, since some healthy tissues, including the stromal cells of the lung, uterus, and ovary, maintain physiological-level expression of PTK7, it is reasonable to anticipate mild to serious toxicities in the respective clinical settings, which might determine the suitability of PTK7 as an immunotherapy target [98].",
        "Podocalyxin (PODXL), alternatively known as TRA-1–60, is a type I membrane-bound glycoprotein that plays critical roles in several organs including the pancreas, kidney, and heart [99]. Substantial evidence indicates that alongside improving the metastatic potential and invasiveness of renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast tumors, PODXL has also been associated with various other malignancies such as human oral squamous cell carcinoma, astrocytic tumors, and colorectal cancer [100]. Even though there have not yet been any CAR-Ts generated to specifically target PODXL-expressing tumor cells, in 2020, Kaneko et al. developed a murine PODXL-specific CasMab (hereafter referred to as PcMab-60) which successfully reacted with the PODXL-overexpressing glioblastoma cell line of LN229 and pancreatic cell line of MIA PaCa-2, while being unreactive towards healthy control cells [100]. Next, they conferred augmented antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) to the mentioned CasMab by first engineering it into a mouse IgG2a-type mAb and then developing a core fucose-deficient mAb [100]. The resultant product, named 60-mG2a-f, exhibited pronounced tumoricidal capacity in MIA PaCa-2 xenograft mouse models suggesting that targeted immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer, as well as other PODXL-overexpressing tumors, with PODXL as the targeted antigen, might be a promising approach that requires future experimental and clinical evaluations [100].",
        "CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in mediating cell adhesion, interaction, and migration, alongside promoting the expression and tumor-intrinsic functions of PD-L1 in TNBC and NSCLC patients [101]. Recognized as a cancer stem cell (CSC) antigen, CD44 has also been correlated with the hematogenous metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma which might make it a likey immunotherapy target, especially in the field of CAR-T therapy [102]. In this regard, Wang et al. generated scFv-based CD44-redirected CAR-Ts (CD44.CAR-Ts) and reported that these cells are potentially cytotoxic towards the Hep3B2, MHCC97H, and SMMC-7721 cell lines and that CD44.CAR-Ts secreted elevated levels of IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α upon encountering them [102]. Moreover, as CD44.CAR-Ts induced remarkable tumor growth inhibition in CD44-positive hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft mice, it is worth noting that there were no signs of CD44.CAR-T-mediated toxicities towards healthy tissues, as reported by Wang and colleagues [102]. However, such findings should be interpreted as cautiously as possible since xenograft mouse models do not perfectly mirror the multidimensional nature of the human immune system (in which CD44 is also expressed by healthy cells, including T cells and macrophages, and its targeting using CAR-Ts might mediate mild to serious off-tumor toxicities in cancer patients) [103, 104]. So, to avoid being farfetched, findings achieved in preclinical mouse models should not be relied on too confidently or used as a trustworthy basis for predicting future clinical safety.",
        "Today, to tell the story of clinical success in cancer treatment and not include CAR-T therapy in it is just unfair. Even though CAR-T therapy has only been clinically approved for the treatment of B-ALL, DLBCL, MM, and MCL, it might still have a lot to offer in various other hematologic malignancies and even solid tumors [118][117][2–4,6]. The discovery of novel antigens, whose targeting using antibody-based therapy holds promising antitumor responses, can both offer fresher opportunities to and accelerate the success rate of CAR-T therapies. Moreover, since tumor cells undertake sophisticated antigen-dependent tricks to evade being recognized by a particular type of therapy, there is a growing need for finding substitute antigens that could be leveraged for therapeutic purposes in times of disease relapse. One of such resistance mechanisms is the loss of the targeted antigen [105]. Moreover, antigen downregulation can also deteriorate the antitumor efficacy of CAR-Ts towards malignant cells since, in sharp contrast with endogenous T cells, CAR-Ts need to interact with a high number of antigens only to produce the necessary downstream signals that trigger their cytolytic reactions [105], [106], [107]. For example, according to a recent report (NCT03185494) by Dai and colleagues, 1 out of 6 R/R B-ALL patients (that had achieved MDR-negative CR following treatment with CD19/22-redirected bispecific CAR-Ts) experienced relapse with CD19-negative leukemic blasts that had downregulated CD22 expression [108]. Also, there is a case of resistance to CAR-T therapy in which alternative splicing gives rise to the expression of isoforms of antigen molecules to which CAR-T targeting domains cannot bind [105,109]. However, in such cases, replacing the targeting domain of the CAR-T product with one that is able to recognize an epitope on the alternatively-spliced antigen would simply suffice to reinvigorate the desired tumoricidal efficacy.",
        "The majority of clinical trials currently investigating CAR-T therapies for hematologic malignancies focus on CD19, CD20, CD22, and BCMA as their selected antigens. Amongst the novel antigens discussed in this review, CS1, FLT3, CD7, and CD26 have often been regarded as non-solid tumor antigens. CAR-Ts targeting these novel antigens might have a stroke of better luck, compared with CAR-Ts targeting solid tumor antigens, in inducing therapeutic benefits. The basis for such mere expectation lies behind the substantial differences between solid and non-solid malignancies. In the context of solid tumors, CAR-Ts face multiple difficulties accessing the tumor cells they are redirected against [110]. The tumor-associated vasculature and the enriched stroma are considered tenacious obstacles that CAR-Ts need to overcome only to be able to interact with the tumor cells expressing their target antigen [110]. Moreover, the hostile TME also imposes harsh conditions on CAR-Ts resulting in their exhaustion [110].",
        "HER2 has been the most famous antigen targeted by CAR-Ts in clinical trials related to solid tumors. HER2 overexpression has been associated with breast, gastric, uterine, ovarian, and lung cancer [111]. Out of the novel antigens presented in this paper, ALPP, CLDN, CD44, PODXL, PTK7, TEM8, GUCY2C, and CLEC14A might be suitable antigens that could be targeted in relapse cases with HER2 expression loss (for instance, in TNBC) because they have been associated with the same oncological indications in which HER2 overexpression is observed. In regards to TNBC, TEM8.CAR-Ts have demonstrated tumor rejection in preclinical animal models [91]. Moreover, PTK7.CAR-Ts have also been able to induce favorable results in xenograft models of breast, ovarian, and lung tumors [98]. However, findings obtained in preclinical animal models of human cancers might not be as translatable in the clinics. An outstanding example in this regard is that the toxicities (mainly CRS and neurotoxicity) observed during the early days of CAR-T therapy investigations in clinical trials came as unforeseen adverse events since they were not anticipated by preclinical experiments [112]. Nevertheless, such preclinical data are necessary key points that have to be taken before advancing into clinical investigations since they play important roles in attracting sponsors to a particular CAR-T product. Also, as discussed throughout this article, some of these novel target antigens are currently under clinical investigation. In the upcoming years and after the related clinical trials have been completed, it can be said more confidently that how promising any of these antigens are in the CAR-T therapy of a particular type of cancer.",
        "Besides the introduction of novel antigens, the utilization of these antigens for the implementation of various intelligent strategies such as bispecific CAR-Ts, multi-CAR-expressing T cells, pooled CAR-Ts, BiTE-secreting CAR-Ts, combinatorial antigen targeting strategies using two- or three-antigen dependent AND or NOT gates, boosting vaccines, and various other recently introduced twists might also be able to amplify the therapeutic efficacy of this type of immunotherapy [116]. Furthermore, some of such tactics might also endow CAR-Ts with powerful discriminatory abilities that can consequently minimize “on-target off-tumor” toxicities delivered to healthy tissues [116]. Moreover, the utilization of various novel gene-editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, TALEN®, and BE, or using ER and/or Golgi antigen anchoring methods can both facilitate the production of fratricide-resistant CAR-Ts, in the case of targeting antigens that are expressed by healthy T cells, and minimize the deleterious impacts of tumor-mediated immunosuppression. Furthermore, the discovery of novel TAAs via single-cell RNA sequencing or whole genome sequencing and the development and equipping of CARs with CasMabs that can only react with the cancer-specific forms of such antigens (that are aberrantly glycosylated and expressed only by the relative tumor cells) might bring new blood to the veins of CAR-T therapy. Aside from CAR-Ts, other treatment modalities such as ADCs, BiTEs, or even naked mAb therapies can also benefit from the discovery of novel antigens. At the end of the day, it is redeeming to conclude that it might not be too unreasonable to hope that years of infallible science behind cancer immunotherapy, and in particular CAR-T therapy, might eventually penetrate through the stubborn dome of cancer.",

Responses to the vaccine in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy are unknown and are likely to be even more diminished. We manually searched vital databases and identified 5 studies that have so far reported COVID-19 vaccine response in a total of 70 CAR-T recipients. The cumulative humoral response rate across all 5 studies was 31%. However, the results are not generalizable due to non-standardized units of humoral response measurement and a lack of external validation. Heterogeneity existed in studies regarding the timing of vaccination post-CAR-T, intervals between the vaccine doses, platforms of response assessment, vaccine platforms, and pre-vaccine immune status. CAR-T-related factors that independently impact vaccine response to prevent COVID-19 have further been reviewed. We conclude that the results must be interpreted with caution given the limitations of small sample sizes, differences in immunoassays, lack of standard definitions and clinical correlates of SARS-CoV-2 immune response, and lack of cellular responses. Until large-scale, homogenous prospective data become available, these preliminary observations will help transplant and infectious disease clinicians with their decision-making while providing care to this profoundly immunosuppressed cohort of patients.

To optimize the management of these patients in clinical practice, we convened an expert panel to review current evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine responses and severe COVID-19 in immunocompromised populations.

        "Although most people will fully recover from COVID-19, people who are immunocompromised are less able to fight the infection and more likely to be hospitalized or die from severe COVID-19. To improve the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in immunocompromised people, 10 experts from France met to discuss the latest medical research in this area. The experts focused on four main groups of immunocompromised people: (1) people receiving organ transplants; (2) people receiving stem cell transplants or T cell therapy; (3) people being treated for blood cancers; and (4) people being treated for inflammatory diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis). These groups of immunocompromised people are less likely to be protected after COVID-19 vaccination and more likely to develop severe forms of COVID-19. Immunocompromised people who are most at risk of severe COVID-19 are older people, people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as diabetes, obesity, and heart, lung, or kidney disease), and people being treated with immunosuppressants. The experts agreed that it is important to quickly identify these people in the clinic, so they can receive COVID-19 booster vaccines every 6 months. For people unable to build up their immunity after vaccination, antibody treatments can also be used to prevent COVID-19 infection. In immunocompromised people with COVID-19, the experts recommend using antiviral therapies (such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or remdesivir) to prevent COVID-19 from becoming severe. In addition to other measures (such as mask wearing and social distancing), these strategies will help to protect immunocompromised people against severe COVID-19.",

        "This article reviews key risk factors for severe COVID-19 in different immunocompromised populations, and provides a French expert opinion on the optimal management of high-risk patients in clinical practice.We identified four main immunocompromised groups who mount suboptimal immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and are at increased risk of severe COVID-19: solid organ transplant recipients, patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, patients treated for hematologic malignancies, and patients treated for inflammatory diseases.A wide range of risk factors were associated with poor vaccine and/or COVID-19 outcomes in these patients, most commonly older age, comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, obesity, and respiratory, renal, or cardiovascular disease), and the type and number of immunosuppressive therapies.Strategies to mitigate the risk of severe COVID-19 in immunocompromised populations include early identification and close monitoring of high-risk patients, enhanced primary vaccination regimens and regular booster doses, pre-exposure prophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies, non-pharmacologic prevention strategies (e.g., mask wearing), and prompt antiviral treatment.",
        "In May 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)—a pandemic since March 2020 [1]—was no longer a public health emergency of international concern, and this coincided with an overall relaxing of national containment and prevention measures around the world [2]. Although COVID-19 is now managed like other common communicable diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to circulate at high levels and remains a threat to several vulnerable populations. In particular, people who are immunocompromised, either through illness and/or the use of immunosuppressive therapies, have been shown to mount suboptimal humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination [3–5] and are consequently at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and associated outcomes, including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality [6–10]. This remains true even after frequent booster vaccines and in the current Omicron era, which is often associated with less severe disease than that caused by previous SARS-CoV-2 variants [11, 12].",
        "While immunocompromised people are broadly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and poor COVID-19 outcomes, they represent a heterogeneous group with different vaccine responses, risk profiles, and requirements for individualized prevention and risk mitigation strategies. To that end, we performed a series of literature searches to evaluate vaccine responses and severe COVID-19-related outcomes in various immunocompromised populations, and convened a panel of French experts to discuss the optimal management of those most at risk of severe COVID-19 in clinical practice. Herein, we review current clinical evidence and discuss strategies to reduce the burden of COVID-19 on immunocompromised populations.",
        "Between July 2022 and March 2024, weekly literature searches were conducted to identify newly published studies that evaluated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses and/or severe COVID-19-related outcomes (with no particular criteria for how “vaccine response” and “severe COVID-19” were defined) in patients with immunodeficiency due to any cause. Sources searched included Embase, medRxiv and bioRxiv (preprints), and the LitCOVID extension of PubMed, in addition to news and press releases from key government agencies and selected journals. In March 2024, a separate search of PubMed was additionally performed to capture any other key studies published since July 2022. Database search strategies and gray literature sources are shown in Supplementary Table S1.",
        "The titles and abstracts of the literature search results were screened to identify articles of interest for inclusion in this review. Articles describing studies conducted in North America and Europe (particularly France) and reporting on severe COVID-19-related outcomes in key immunocompromised populations (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients) were prioritized; however, studies outside these criteria were included at the authors’ discretion. Additional articles of interest were also identified through ad hoc literature searches or provided by the authors on the basis of their clinical and research expertise.",
        "The articles of interest were presented at an expert roundtable meeting in March 2024, which aimed to discuss the current challenges of identifying and managing patients at increased risk of severe COVID-19 in French clinical practice. One expert (PL) was invited to chair the meeting and select other national experts with relevant clinical and research experience to participate. Together, the expert roundtable comprised a multidisciplinary panel of 10 physicians from across France (the authors), who specialized in infectious diseases, intensive care medicine, hematology, nephrology, pulmonology, rheumatology, and virology. The present article reviews the key studies, issues, and discussions raised during the expert roundtable meeting.

        "Our literature searches yielded 62 articles of interest that describe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses and/or severe COVID-19-related outcomes among immunocompromised patients. Four main immunocompromised populations were identified from the articles of interest, based on both the volume of studies in these groups and the particularly poor outcomes reported: solid organ transplant recipients; patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy; patients receiving treatment for hematologic malignancies; and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for inflammatory diseases (defined as any chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder that may affect many organ systems including skin, joints, and internal organs).

        "The key studies varied widely in terms of methodology, and particularly with respect to how “vaccine response” and “severe COVID-19” were defined and measured, but nevertheless showed that related outcomes were suboptimal in these four immunocompromised groups. The articles of interest and discussion points from the expert roundtable meeting are described in the following sections, and the key findings of this review are summarized in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Key findings from a literature review and expert roundtable discussion on the risk of poor SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses or severe COVID-19-related outcomes in immunocompromised patients.

        "Data from our articles of interest suggest that the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is markedly reduced in solid organ transplant recipients (Table 1) [3–5, 13–21]. In particular, several studies showed that humoral responses to vaccination were lower among solid organ transplant recipients versus immunocompetent controls [3–5]. Humoral responses in solid organ transplant recipients increased with the number of doses received, highlighting the importance of three-dose primary vaccination in these patients [13, 17, 21], but remained suboptimal when compared with two-dose vaccinated controls [3, 5]. Additional studies showed that fourth [14], fifth [19], and sixth doses [20] further improved vaccine responses in solid organ transplant recipients, emphasizing the need to pursue booster vaccination efforts in this population.",
        "In studies that evaluated predictive factors for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response in solid organ transplant recipients [3, 4, 13, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22], common factors associated with a reduced humoral response included older age, shorter time between transplant and vaccination, higher serum creatinine levels, and the use of immunosuppressive therapies (Table 1). More specifically, the odds of mounting an adequate response to vaccination were found to be reduced with two- or three-drug immunosuppression, and with the use of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, belatacept, and/or steroids [3, 4, 13, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22]. Beyond specific immunosuppressive therapies, the overall burden of immunosuppression also appears to be a major risk factor in solid organ transplant recipients. Indeed, several studies have shown a correlation between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response and torque teno virus viral load, which is an indicator of overall immunosuppression [17, 18, 21]. Other factors associated with reduced vaccine responses included lung, heart, and kidney transplants (vs. liver transplant), non-White race, diabetes, and lymphopenia [4, 22]. Conversely, increasing body mass index and a prior history of COVID-19 were associated with improved humoral responses, whereas the association between sex and vaccine response was inconsistent across articles of interest [4, 13, 22].",
        "In addition to reduced vaccine response, several articles of interest reported that solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 compared with immunocompetent or other immunocompromised populations (Table 1). The studies varied in terms of patient populations and outcome measures, but most found that cohorts including solid organ transplant recipients were associated with increased risks of severe disease, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and/or mortality related to COVID-19 [6–9, 23–32]. Some studies additionally showed that the magnitude of increased risk was greater with a shorter time between transplant and developing COVID-19 [7, 25], during the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha wave versus later Delta and Omicron waves [30, 33], and among recipients of kidney or lung transplants versus other organs [8, 9, 27, 33, 34].",
        "In articles of interest that identified factors associated with severe COVID-19-related outcomes in solid organ transplant recipients, common risk factors included increasing age, presence of comorbidities (including dialysis, diabetes, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and obesity), and use of immunosuppressive therapies (Table 1) [25, 33–37]. Hospitalization for COVID-19 was an additional risk factor for all-cause mortality in kidney transplant recipients [25], whereas prior ischemic heart disease was associated with severe COVID-19 in heart transplant recipients [37].",
        "Similar to solid organ transplant recipients, the protection afforded by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is often suboptimal among patients receiving HSCT (particularly allogeneic HSCT) or CAR T cell therapy (Table 2) [3, 5, 16, 38–42]. In studies of HSCT recipients, humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were improved with three doses compared with two [39, 41], but nevertheless remained lower than two-dose vaccinated healthy controls [3, 5]. A French retrospective study additionally found that neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated allogeneic HSCT recipients were lower against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant versus earlier D614G, Beta, and Delta variants, even after three vaccine doses [39]. Data from patients receiving CAR T cell therapy suggest that humoral responses to vaccination are further reduced in these patients when compared with HSCT recipients [38, 40, 42].",
        "Unlike solid organ transplant recipients, who require immunosuppressive therapy for life, allogeneic HSCT recipients typically use immunosuppressants for a defined period, which can be extended in the event of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Therefore, time to transplantation and the occurrence of GvHD are factors associated with the severity of immunodepression. Indeed, a French study of 687 allogeneic HSCT recipients reported that the odds of an absent antibody response after two vaccine doses were increased with the use of rituximab within 6 months of vaccination, shorter time (< 12 months) between HSCT and vaccination, an absolute lymphocyte count of < 1 × 109/L, and the use of immunosuppressive therapies within 3 months of vaccination (Table 2) [41]. Moreover, a Swiss study of immunocompromised populations including allogeneic HSCT recipients found that the use of immunosuppressive therapies (including mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, chemotherapy, and tacrolimus) reduced the odds of mounting an anti-Spike antibody titer > 300 IU/mL after vaccination [3]. In a cohort of allogeneic HSCT or CAR T cell therapy recipients, factors associated with positive serology after vaccination were increased time since the infusion of cells, female sex, and higher CD19+ cell count [42], while in patients receiving CAR T cell therapy, the odds of seroconversion after vaccination were increased after four or more vaccine doses (vs. two doses) and in those with relapse or refractory multiple myeloma (vs. other B cell malignancies) [43].",
        "Several articles of interest reported that HSCT recipients are at very high risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and/or mortality due to COVID-19 (Table 2) [6–8, 23, 24]. These studies found that in cohorts including HSCT recipients, the incidence of severe/critical COVID-19 was approximately tenfold higher than the general population [24] and 1.6-fold higher than other immunocompromised patients [23]. In addition, the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization among HSCT recipients was approximately 10–15-fold higher [6, 7, 24] and the odds of excess mortality due to COVID-19 was twofold higher [8] than in immunocompetent populations.",
        "In our articles of interest, common factors associated with poor COVID-19-related outcomes (including severe disease, hospitalization, or mortality) in HSCT recipients included advancing age, increasing number of comorbidities, shorter time from HSCT to COVID-19, and use of immunosuppressive therapies (Table 2) [35, 44–47]. Other risk factors identified from these studies included active hematologic disease at COVID-19 diagnosis [44], and the presence of COVID-19 symptoms including pneumonia and other non-respiratory symptoms [46, 47]. Patients receiving CAR T cell therapy had greater odds of COVID-19-related hospitalization versus allogeneic HSCT recipients [45]; other risk factors for severe COVID-19 and/or mortality in these patients included increasing age, active hematologic disease, and metabolic comorbidities [48–50].",
        "Studies suggest that patients with hematologic malignancies have a moderate response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (Table 3) [4, 16, 51]. A US study found that the rate of seropositivity for anti-Spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) after vaccination was 50.0% among patients with hematologic malignancies, which was higher than in solid organ transplant recipients (30.7%) but lower than immunocompetent controls (92.4%) [4]. Similarly, a French study reported that the proportion of patients with an anti-Spike IgG titer ≥ 3100 UA/mL after two vaccine doses was 46.7% in those with hematologic malignancies, compared with 87% in healthy individuals [51]. Another French study reported a seroconversion rate of 61% after two vaccine doses in patients with plasma cell disorders (multiple myeloma, plasma cell leukemia, and light chain amyloidosis), compared with 24% in those with B cell malignancies (aggressive, indolent B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia) [52]. A third vaccine dose further improved the seroconversion rate among patients with plasma cell disorders, but had limited effect in patients with B cell malignancies. Factors associated with reduced vaccine responses in these studies included older age, male sex, increasing prior lines of therapy, higher CD19+ B cell and CD3+ T cell counts, and current or recent immunosuppressive treatment (systemic, anti-B cell, anti-CD20, and/or anti-CD38 therapies) [4, 51, 52].",
        "The risk of poor COVID-19-related outcomes (including severe/critical disease, hospitalization, or mortality) are increased among patients with hematologic malignancies (Table 3) [6–8, 23, 24, 26, 31, 53, 54]. Among our articles of interest, the INFORM-UK study found that the incidence of hospitalization due to COVID-19 was 3.6-fold higher in patients with hematologic malignancy ≤ 5 years prior versus the general population, while the incidence of COVID-19-related ICU admission and mortality were 13.6- and 3.7-fold higher, respectively [7]. The incidence of these events was further increased among those with active or recent treatment for hematologic malignancy (≤ 12 months prior), and in those with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or acute leukemia (≤ 2 years prior) [7].",
        "In articles of interest that evaluated factors associated with severe COVID-19-related outcomes in patients with hematologic malignancies, common risk factors identified were increasing age, presence of comorbidities (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, diabetes, obesity, and chronic kidney disease), and use of immunosuppressants (including glucocorticoids and/or non-glucocorticoids, and T or B cell immunotherapies; Table 3) [35, 55–57]. A US study of patients with cancer additionally identified lymphoma and leukemia as independent risk factors for severe disease, hospitalization, and 30-day mortality attributed to COVID-19 [56]. A French study found that patients with hematologic malignancies who were hospitalized with COVID-19 were more likely to have negative or weakly positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 serologies than non-hospitalized patients [57], while others found that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (fully vaccinated status or booster/additional dose) and use of COVID-19 treatments (oral antivirals and monoclonal antibodies) were each associated with lower odds of developing severe disease [55, 56].",
        "Overall, patients with inflammatory diseases appear to achieve moderate responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination when compared with immunocompetent or other immunocompromised populations (Table 4) [4, 5, 16, 58–61]. However, “inflammatory diseases” represents a heterogeneous group of diagnoses, and humoral responses to vaccination are highly dependent on whether patients have received anti-CD20 therapy (e.g., rituximab) [5, 58, 62, 63]. Indeed, some articles of interest identified anti-CD20 therapy as a factor associated with lower odds of seropositivity after vaccination, in addition to other treatments including glucocorticoids, abatacept, mycophenolate mofetil, and upadacitinib [4, 59, 61]. Other studies of rituximab-treated patients have correlated seroprotection with a longer time between rituximab infusion and vaccination (or vice versa) [58, 60] and a detectable B cell count [62], suggesting that humoral responses to vaccination are achievable once peripheral B cells have repopulated. Notably, a French study showed that B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were diminished in rituximab-treated patients with autoimmune diseases (vs. patients treated with other immunosuppressants and healthy controls); however, functional T cell responses in these patients were preserved [58]. Like other immunocompromised populations, increasing age has also been associated with reduced vaccine responses in patients with inflammatory diseases [59, 61], in addition to diagnoses of rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic inflammatory myositis, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (vs. psoriatic arthritis) [59].",
        "Patients with inflammatory diseases and those receiving immunosuppressive therapies are at increased risk of severe disease, hospitalization, or mortality due to COVID-19 (Table 4) [6–9, 23, 24, 29, 31, 53, 54]. Among individuals included in the INFORM-UK study, the incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalization, ICU admission, and/or mortality were significantly increased among patients with secondary immunodeficiencies caused by immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy (particularly active treatment with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, transplant-related and cancer chemotherapeutic agents, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] blockers, and other non-corticosteroid agents), and in those with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases receiving high-dose or long-term moderate-dose corticosteroid therapy [7]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis including 1.5 million immunocompromised patients, the odds of excess COVID-19-related mortality was significantly increased among patients with rheumatologic diseases (particularly joint-related diseases and general autoimmune/inflammatory conditions) and those receiving immunosuppressive therapies (including systemic steroids, biologics, chemotherapy/radiotherapy, and other treatments) [8].",
        "In patients with inflammatory diseases, common risk factors associated with severe disease, hospitalization, and/or death due to COVID-19 included older age, male sex, and the presence of comorbidities (including interstitial lung disease, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease; Table 4) [64–66]. Treatment with rituximab, interleukin (IL)-1 inhibitors, corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil, sulfasalazine, colchicine, and hydroxychloroquine were also associated with increased risk of poor COVID-19-related outcomes, whereas the use of TNFα blockers and IL-6 inhibitors were found to be protective [35, 64–67].",
        "Our review of current clinical evidence identified four main immunocompromised patient populations, and a wide range of related risk factors, associated with poor SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses and/or severe COVID-19-related outcomes. More specifically, older age, comorbidities, and the type and number of immunosuppressive therapies were among the most common risk factors associated with poor outcomes in solid organ transplant recipients, patients receiving allogeneic HSCT or CAR T cell therapy, patients with hematologic malignancies, and those with inflammatory diseases. On the basis of current evidence, we believe that patients in these four immunocompromised groups—and particularly those with key risk factors identified from our literature review—represent patients who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. In clinical practice, regularly monitoring immunocompromised patients is critical to ensure that these high-risk patients are promptly identified, and that appropriate prevention and risk mitigation strategies are implemented (Fig. 1). However, further research into biomarkers that can predict vaccine responses and disease severity would assist in identifying at-risk patients and enabling individualized COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Despite the belief that most people will have acquired hybrid immunity against SARS-CoV-2 by now and that more recent variants cause less severe disease, physicians with immunocompromised patients must remain informed on COVID-19 epidemiology, the virulence of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, and their sensitivity to current curative and preventive therapies.",
        "Despite heterogeneity in how “vaccine response” was defined and measured across studies, articles of interest in our review consistently showed that solid organ transplant recipients, patients receiving allogeneic HSCT or CAR T cell therapy, patients with hematologic malignancies, and those receiving treatment for inflammatory diseases mount moderate-to-poor immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. However, many studies also showed that vaccine responses improved with each additional dose, highlighting the importance of enhanced primary vaccination regimens and regular booster doses in these immunocompromised populations. In line with WHO and French ministerial recommendations [68, 69], we suggest that boosters with the latest generation of vaccines (i.e., adapted to circulating variants) should be given every 6 months since the last dose or SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, vaccination schedules should also be modified on the basis of individual risk profiles. More frequent boosters can be considered for very high-risk patients, such as older people or those receiving multidrug immunosuppressive therapy, but this should be balanced with the need to avoid vaccination fatigue and maintain patient adherence. Given that time since transplant/treatment is a common risk factor for poor vaccine responses in patients receiving solid organ transplant, allogeneic HSCT, CAR T cell therapy, or B cell-depleting therapies, boosters should ideally be timed before transplant/treatment in these patients, and/or delayed until acute phases of immunosuppression have passed.",
        "Serology tests can also be used to monitor humoral responses and guide vaccination schedules, but are controversial because of a lack of consensus thresholds for protection and their need to be adapted to current circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants [70]. Moreover, serology only monitors a portion of the immune response, but is easier to assess than cellular immunity. We recommend against using serology to evaluate protection without a correlate of protection for both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. Future studies focused on optimizing the timing of vaccination in relation to transplant/treatment, exploring new vaccine formulations, and investigating adjunct therapies to enhance vaccine efficacy in immunocompromised individuals are essential.",
        "We advocate using monoclonal antibodies as primary prophylaxis, when effective against dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants, in immunocompromised patients who are unable to mount an adequate immune response to vaccination. This recommendation is in line with WHO guidelines [71], and based on clinical evidence that monoclonal antibodies are safe and effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and/or severe disease-related outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, ICU admission, mortality) in immunocompromised populations [72–74]. However, current monoclonal antibodies have also been shown to have waning or no neutralizing activity against some SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants [74–77], highlighting the need for new prophylactic treatment options and ongoing monitoring of their effectiveness in clinical practice. In addition to vaccination and monoclonal antibodies, we emphasize the importance of non-pharmacologic prevention strategies (e.g., mask wearing, social distancing, practicing good hand and respiratory hygiene) to further protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection during periods of high community transmission.",
        "In immunocompromised patients who develop COVID-19 despite preventative measures, early treatment with antiviral therapies should be used to mitigate the risk of progression to severe disease. Similar to WHO and French recommendations [78, 79], we support the use of first-line nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients with COVID-19 and at high risk of severe disease; in cases where nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may cause adverse drug–drug interactions with ongoing immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., calcineurin, mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors) or is otherwise contraindicated, remdesivir can be considered as an alternative treatment option. We advocate the use of remdesivir plus dexamethasone for the treatment of immunocompromised patients who progress to severe COVID-19 [80], whereas convalescent plasma may be considered for patients who meet acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria, based on reduced 28-day mortality versus patients receiving standard care in the randomized CONFIDENT trial [81]. Convalescent plasma with a high neutralizing titer (≥ 1:320) should preferably come from donors who were infected with the same SARS-CoV-2 variant responsible for the patient’s infection (or at least the predominant variant). The infusion of a dose of 1–2 units (400–500 mL in total) can be repeated after 24 h.",
        "The decision to pause, change, or adjust immunosuppressive therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection should balance the risk of severe COVID-19 with other risks related to the underlying immunocompromising condition, such as transplant rejection, cancer progression, or exacerbation of inflammatory diseases. Future research is needed to optimize COVID-19 treatment strategies for immunocompromised patients (e.g., combination therapies [82, 83], extended antiviral courses [84, 85]), and to establish consensus guidelines for adjusting immunosuppressive therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the timing of dose reductions and the use of alternative therapies.",
        "Although COVID-19 is no longer considered a global public health emergency, the ongoing burden of COVID-19 is disproportionately shouldered by the immunocompromised community. In particular, our literature searches and expert roundtable meeting identified four main immunocompromised patient populations—solid organ transplant recipients, patients receiving HSCT or CAR T cell therapy, those with hematologic malignancies, and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for inflammatory diseases—who mount suboptimal humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and are at increased risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and mortality due to COVID-19. Our articles of interest identified a wide range of risk factors associated with reduced vaccine responses and/or poor COVID-19 outcomes in these populations, with the most common being older age, comorbidities, and the type and number of immunosuppressive therapies. We believe that early identification and close monitoring of these at-risk patients, in addition to regular booster vaccinations, prophylactic monoclonal antibody therapy, non-pharmacologic prevention measures, prompt antiviral treatment, and other risk mitigation strategies, are critical to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and alleviate the burden of COVID-19 for patients and healthcare systems.",

        "Significant advances have been made in the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy [1–4]. Using allogeneic (donor)-derived CAR-T cell carries a risk of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), potentially leading to fatal outcomes. However, donor-derived CAR-T cell poses minimal GVHD risk and is a viable option for treating relapsed B-ALL after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) [5, 6]. Most patients who achieve complete remission (CR) after autologous CAR-T cell therapy experience relapse, making bridge transplantation a crucial intervention. Although a second transplantation offers benefits, it is linked with high treatment-related mortality and low survival rates. Its necessity remains uncertain for relapsed CD19-positive B-ALL patients who achieved CR after receiving donor-derived CD19 CAR-T cell post-allo-HSCT. In our previous report, relapsed CD19-positive B-ALL patients received donor-derived CD19 CAR-T cell after allo-HSCT and achieved CR without requiring a second transplantation. These patients showed a high probability of achieving one-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) [7, 8]. In this study, we updated the long-term survival outcomes for the patients who achieved CR after donor CAR-T cell treatment without the second transplantation.",
        "A total of 32 relapsed patients with CD19-positive B-ALL after allo-HSCT who received donor-derived CD19 CAR-T cell and achieved CR were included in the study. Patient baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The study period ranged from October 2015 to March 2019, with the last follow-up on April 1, 2024. The cohort consisted of 19 male and 13 female patients, with a median age of 24 years (range, 4 to 60). The median follow-up period was 42 months (range, 1 to 91). For safety analysis, we did not observe any new long-term toxicities. The duration of EFS was calculated from the time of CR, no response, relapse or death, whichever occurred first, was regarded as the event. The OS was calculated from the time of CR until death. The 2-year OS and EFS were 56.25% and 50.0%, respectively. The 5-year OS and EFS were 53.13% and 46.88%, respectively (Fig. 1).",

        "These results surpass those of relapse patients who underwent a second transplantation or donor lymphocyte infusion without receiving CAR-T cell therapy. The favorable long-term survival demonstrated by donor-derived CD19 CAR-T cell indicates that this treatment is effective for relapsed patients following allo-HSCT. While our long-term data provides valuable insights into the efficacy of donor-derived CAR-T cell therapy after allo-HSCT, the potential benefits of a second transplantation in this setting may still require further validation through multicenter, prospective, and randomized controlled trials. Relapse occurred in the majority of patients during the initial years following CAR-T cell therapy, particularly within the first six months, despite the use of healthy T cells as carriers [9]. Therefore, it is critical to develop early detection methods for preventing or identifying the cause of relapse following CAR-T cell therapy [10, 11].",
