        "The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has made an invaluable contribution to the field of regenerative medicine, paving way for identifying the true potential of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

        "The science around terminal inactivation and deletion of genetic codes of heredity in somatic cells was postulated by the Weismann barrier theory [1]. The somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) demonstration asserted the fact that the genetic code in somatic cells is not discarded, and that reactivation of the same is a possibility through careful manipulations [2]. Developmental biology entered a new dimension of achievement when the discovery of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and their pluripotency was exhibited, and further research identified that on fusion of somatic cells like fibroblasts, and T-lymphocytes with ESCs, reprogramming of the former through expression of genes associated with pluripotency becomes a possibility [3,4]. The findings around SCNT and ESC fusion identified the possibility of reversion in somatic cells indicating the presence of reprogramming factors that bear the potential to act as epigenetic memory erasing factors [5]. The earliest study around generation of pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts was linked to introduction of four crucial transcription factors including octamer binding transcription factor 3/4 (Oct3/4), sex determining region Y—box 2 (SRY-Sox2), Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), and cellular-Myelocytomatosis (c-Myc) (OSKM) [6]. The allogenic trait of ESCs, risk of immune rejection in the recipient along with need for lifetime immunosuppression, and the ethicality around using the same, makes human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) an established candidate for regenerative therapies as they were found to not impact the host immune system [7]. The introduction of the iPSCs technology happened in the year 2006, and since then multiple observational studies have recounted its impact on cardiac diseases, ophthalmic conditions, as well as neurological disorders [8,9,10]. Figure 1 highlights the process of generating iPS cells.",
        "The nuclear reprogramming strategies, without compromising on safety and quality for therapeutic applications, include the integrative or nonintegrative transfer systems using viral or nonviral vectors. The first iPSCs were generated by integrating viral vectors, more popularly the retrovirus wherein the resultant iPSCs exhibited failure in complete expression of endogenous genes of pluripotency [11]. The more efficient viral vector has been documented to be the lentiviral vector (LV), which has recorded a reprogramming efficiency of between 0.1–1% [12,13,14]. To ensure increased safety for therapeutics, nonviral integrative systems have also been worked upon involving use of two plasmids; once encoding for c-Myc, and the other for the four reprogramming factors [15]. However, this system was also shown to have risk of integration, and low reprogramming efficiency. In case of nonintegrative nonviral systems for reprogramming, delivery of pluripotency marker genes has been done using self-replicating vectors, and cytoplasmic RNA. Though easy to work with, the reprogramming efficiency has been found to be lower than LV [16]. Today, research has identified possibility of successful reprogramming using microRNAs (miRNAs) which exhibit improved efficiency, wherein use of c-Myc has been replaced with miR-291-3p, miR-294, and miR-295 to generate homogenous colonies of human iPSCs [17]. The reprogramming methods have been highlighted in Table 1.",
        "There are many assays, including molecular and functional, to evaluate the developmental efficiency of iPSCs. These include alkaline phosphatase staining of pluripotency markers, DNA demethylation, retroviral silencing, and factor independence involving assessment of self-renewal in the absence of dox-inducible trans genes. The functional assays include teratoma formation, chimera development, tetraploid complementation, germline transmission, and in vitro differentiation [14]. Considering the low reprogramming efficiency in iPSCs, many studies have identified blocks in lineage conversion. Reprogramming pathway studies in fibroblasts have identified the repel factor to be involved in mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and BMP receptor signaling [27,28]. Further studies on the refractory fibroblasts indicate negative iPSC generation in spite of prolonged culturing and presence of homogeneous factor expression indicating loss of somatic program, and activation of endogenous pluripotency genes to be the main roadblocks in formation of iPSCs [14]. The other limiting factor has been linked to expression levels of Nanog locus which are activated late in the reprogramming process and thus limit efficiency of conversion [29]. Gene silencing by DNA methylation, involving the pluripotency genes nanog and Oct4 which causes blockage in binding of transcription factors, has also been linked to causing interference in reprogramming [30]. Though the four most popular reprogramming factors have been Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, human iPSCs have also been derived using expression of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Lin28, indicating that pluripotent ground state becomes achievable through activation of different transcription factors [21]. The detailed derivation of iPSC along with the assay has been highlighted in Figure 2.",
        "The therapeutic potential of iPSC towards personalized cell therapy and disease modelling, has extended the functionality beyond laboratory tables as a research tool in murine and human models. Animal studies have identified promising potential of iPSC around treatment of genetic disorders, including sickle cell anemia; disease modelling of complex degenerative conditions like diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and the feasibility to be used in organ transplantation without risk of rejection and need of immunosuppression [14,31]. Few highlights on the therapeutic potential of iPSCs have been summarized in Table 2. The focus of the current review is to highlight and discuss the therapeutic roles of human iPSCs in different conditions and the future.",
        "Pluripotency and self-renewal are unique characteristics of iPSC that make them ideal for disease modelling and regenerative medicine. Their ability to indefinitely differentiate into cells of all the three germ layers makes them an important source for treating injuries as well as diseases. The availability of generating patient-specific iPSC with high efficiency and safety through protocols involving biochemical and epigenetic aspects expands the therapeutic potential of this tool. This can be assessed from the fact that a clinical trial involving iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons have been initiated for Parkinson’s disease after successful in vivo studies involving immunodeficient mice highlighted no risk of tumorigenicity [43]. Further, tissue resident macrophages, which are critical for immunity and derived from human-iPSCs, have been found to be immunologically different and better than the traditional monocyte-derived macrophages. Studies have shown human iPSC macrophages to restrict Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth in vitro by >75%, and were found to be capable of mounting antibacterial response when challenged with pathogens [44]. The greatest niche for iPSCs is the ability to generate the same from different donor categories including the diseased, and healthy making its application in the clinical setting at any stage a feasibility without the ethical issues around the ESCs.",
        "The fundamental use of iPSC in regenerative medicine remains undisputed, but the tumorigenic potential of residual undifferentiated stem cells necessitates the need to devise strategies to remove the same from differentiated cells. Different study reports multiple treatment methodologies for eliminating undifferentiated iPSCs and one such recent publication identified undifferentiated hiPSCs to be sensitive to treatment involving medium supplemented with high concentration of L-alanine [45]. Another study assessed the efficacy of plasma-activated medium (PAM) in eliminating undifferentiated hiSPCs through inducing oxidative stress. This study found PAM to selectively eliminate undifferentiated hiPSCs cocultured with normal human dermal fibroblasts, which were the differentiated cells. Lower expression of oxidative-stress related genes in the undifferentiated hiPSCs were found to be the underlying cause for PAM-selective cell death [46]. A recent study report describes the use of salicylic diamines to remove residual undifferentiated cells from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Salicylic diamines were found to exert their specific cytotoxic activity in the pluripotent stem cells by inhibiting the oxygen consumption rate. Teratoma formation was also found to be abolished in comparison to untreated cells [47].",
        "Non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, have emerged to be one of the leading causes for mortality in developed as well as developing nations. The trigger for myriad heart conditions exists both in genetics and the environment, which makes studying disease etiology in animal models complicated and inefficient. Animal model studies indicate up to 90% failure in new drug clinical trials, highlighting the limitation around prediction of safety and efficacy among humans. The iPSCs-based disease models have been studied for cardiac channelopathies including hereditary long QT syndrome (LQTS), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC); the endothelial cell disease including familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (FPAH); the smooth muscle cell condition including Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), and Marfan syndrome (MFS) [8].",
        "LQTS is an inherited fatal arrhythmia syndrome and around 17 genes have been associated with congenital LQTS, including the three main genes; KCNQ1 (LQT1), KCNH2 (LQT2), and SCN5A (LQT3), together which account for ~75% of clinically definite cases. The current therapeutic intervention includes β-blockers and a surgical procedure named left cardiac sympathetic denervation. Though genetic markers have been defined, the occurrence of variance of unknown significance (VUS) in 1 of 3 patients adds to the dilemma of inconclusive diagnosis. The need for better diagnostic platforms to assess outcome of genetic variants as well as different therapeutics led to the introduction of iPSCs. Many studies have worked to improve the differentiation efficiency, cellular maturation, and lineage specificity, develop new high-throughput assays for cellular phenotyping, and promote clinical implementation of patient-specific genetic models. A study by Wu J.C. et al. [48], utilized patient iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and devised various strategies to reduce heterogeneity. These include derivation of chamber-specific cardiomyocytes, cultivation for extended period, 3-dimensional and mechanical conditioning, rapid electric stimulation, and hormonal stimulation; use of multicellular preparations to reduce intercellular variability; and development of high-throughput cellular phenotyping using optogenetic sensors including genetically coded voltage and calcium indicators. Further, this study also established the utility of iPSC-CMs to distinguish between pathogenic and benign variants to improve diagnosis and management of LQTS using CRISPR genome editing. This study, using iPSC-CMs, also identified factors causative for prolonged QT including upregulation of genes; DLG2, KCNE4, PTRF, and HTR2C and downregulation of CAMKV gene. Thus iPSC-based model platforms aid in developing a better understanding around intractable clinical problems associated with diseases like LQTS.",
        "In case of DCM, characterized by ventricular chamber enlargement, and dilation as well as systolic dysfunction, human derived iPSCs have been used to investigate the excitation-contraction-coupling machinery, response to positive inotropic interventions, and study the proteome profile. This study utilized DCM patient specific-iPSC derived from skin fibroblasts and identified defects in assembly and maintenance of sarcomeric structure in the mutated iPSC-CM, as well as lower response to β-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol, and increased [Ca2+] out and angiotensin-II. This indicates mutated CM from DCM patients to express blunted inotropic response [49]. In case of HCM which is the most common cause of sudden death among the young, iPSC models have been used to identify pathogenesis of the condition. Once such study involving iPSC-CM derived from patients in a maternally inherited HCM family positive for the mitochondrial 16s rRNA gene (MT-RNR2) mutation m.2336T > C identified mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultrastructure defects among the carriers. Further, reduction in levels of mitochondrial proteins, the ATP/ADP ratio, and mitochondrial potential was also found. These lead to increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels, that becomes causative for HCM-specific electrophysiological abnormalities [50]. Recent studies have also generated peripheral blood mononuclear cells-derived iPSC from HCM patient positive for the myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) pathogenic mutation c.3369–3370 insC by the episomal method, which underwent successful differentiation to triblast cells with normal male karyotype, and expression of pluripotent markers indicating its usefulness as a tool to study HCM [51].",
        "The iPSC models around FPAH have identified modification of BMPR2 signaling causing reduced endothelial cell adhesion, migration, survival, as well as angiogenesis. The autosomal dominant BMPR2 disease causing mutation has been found to be only 20% penetrant and the use of iPSC identified increased BIRC3 to be related to improved survival, indicating the potential to use protective modifiers of FPAH for developing treatment strategies in the future [52]. The iPSC model around WBS with haploinsufficiency found deficiency of elastin and the patient-derived smooth muscle cell to be immature and highly proliferative with defects in function and contractile properties. The rescue was done by upregulating elastin signaling and use of anti-proliferative drug rapamycin [53]. In case of MFS, disease pathogenesis investigation using iPSCs identified defects in fibrillin-1 accumulation, degradation of extracellular matrix, abnormal activation of transforming growth factor-β, and cellular apoptosis [54].",
        "The iPSC technology is also largely viewed to promote pre-clinical drug trials and screening over animal models to overcome differences in electrophysiological properties between human and animal cardiomyocytes. Studies have shown patient-derived iPSCs to exhibit higher sensitivity towards cardiotoxic drugs that could be the cause for change in action potential and arrhythmia [55]. Studies which have analyzed the beat characteristics of 3D engineered cardiac tissues have proven the occurrence of physiologically relevant changes in cardiac contraction in response to increasing concentrations of drugs like verapamil (multi-ion channel blocker) and metoprolol (β-adrenergic antagonist) [56].",
        "Thus, iPSC has been successfully used to model and understand pathogenesis of different cardiac diseases, providing insights on pathways around progression as well as for assessment of drug toxicity. These highlight the potential to use iPSC-based models for precision medicine in clinical use.",
        "Theoretically iPSC has the potential to be programmed to form any cell in the human body, and coupled with improvements in reprogramming techniques, this technology has advanced our knowledge on disease pathology, developing precise therapeutics, as well as fuel advances in regenerative medicine [57]. In case of neurodegenerative conditions, and psychiatric disorders, the genetic predisposition and its relation to the disease pathophysiology is complex, and often there is alteration at structural as well as functional levels. In case of schizophrenia, which is aptly termed the “disease of the synapses”, studies have generated iPSC from family members positive for a frameshift mutation in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) and used gene editing to generate isogenic iPS cell lines. This study found depletion of DISC1 protein among the mutation carriers, along with dysregulation of genes associated with synapses and psychiatric disorders in the forebrain. This mutation causes deficit of synaptic vesicles among the iPS-cell derived forebrain neurons. This identification of transcriptional dysregulation in human neurons, highlights a new facet involving synaptic dysregulation in mental disorders [58]. The technology of stem cell therapy has also been used to restore the functionality in many degenerative conditions including that of the retina that leads to loss of vision. Studies have evaluated the use iPSC to overcome challenges posed by use of stem cell therapy. The proposed strategy revolves around transplantation of photoreceptors with or without the retinal pigment epithelium cells for treating retinal degradation, with minimal risk using iPSC [59].",
        "Degenerative disease generally progresses through multiple differentiation stages, and using iPSC models, these pathways of transition can be easily identified to assess cause as well as etiopathology better. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves loss of neurons from the spinal cord and motor cortex causing paralysis and death. The research around advancement of therapeutics, requires supply of human motor neurons positive for the causative genetic mutations that will also aid in understanding the root cause of motor neuron death. One study documented the production of iPS from ALS patient specific-skin fibroblasts from two sisters. Both were identified to be positive for the L144F (Leu144 → Phe) mutation of the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene that is associated with a slowly progressing form of ALS. This study found successful reprogramming to be possible with only four factors; KLF4, SOX2, OCT4, and c-MYC. Further, the severe disability state of the patients used for harvesting in this case did not seem to block the transformation process or efficiency [60]. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome and is a chromosomal instability disorder needing transplantation of hematopoietic grafts from HLA-identical sibling donors. The reduced quality of the hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow of the affected limits the benefit of gene therapy trials. Studies have worked upon formation of genetically corrected FA-specific iPSCs through non-hematopoietic somatic cells reprogramming to generate large number of genetically-stable autologous hematopoietic stem cells for treating bone marrow failure in FA. The reprogramming was done on dermal fibroblasts involving two rounds of infection with mouse-stem-cell-virus-based retrovirus encoding amino-terminal flag-tagged version of the four transcription factors; OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC. A batch of genetically corrected somatic cells using lentiviral vectors encoding FANCA or FANCD2 was also used for reprogramming to overcome the predisposition to apoptosis found in FA cells. The FANCA involved fibroblasts also underwent successful transformation to generate iPSCs. This study also found restoration of the FA pathway as a necessity to generate iPS from somatic cells of FA patients. The persistent FANCA expression in the FA-iPS cells indicated successful generation of genetically corrected FA-iPSCs with functional FA pathway, and disease-free status [61].",
        "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common chronic progressive disorder due to loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The pathophysiology of the disease is complex and research till date lacks complete understanding. Further, sporadic cases are not linked to any genetic variation. Development of patient-specific invitro iPSC models have been attempted to understand disease etiology better. Studies have worked upon generating iPSCs from sporadic cases of PD, which have been successfully reprogrammed to form dopaminergic neurons free of the reprogramming factors. This study utilized doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vectors that were excised with Cre-/lox-recombinase, resulting in generation of iPSC free of programming factors, and which retained all the pluripotent characteristics after removal of transgenes. This removal of promoter and transgene sequences from the vector reduced risk of oncogenic transformation and re-expression of the transduced transcription factors. This study highlighted the possibility of generating stable iPS-cell line in PD for better disease modelling [62]. Another study worked on improving the safety of human and non-human primate iPSC derived dopaminergic neurons for cell transplantation treatment in PD. This study found the protocol of NCAM(+)/CD29(low) sorting to result in enriching ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons from the pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cell populations. Further, these neurons also exhibited increased expression of FOXA2, LMX1A, TH, GIRK2, PITX3, EN1, and NURR1 mRNA. These neurons were also found to bear the potential to restore motor function among the 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats, 16 weeks after transplantation. Further, the primate iPSC-derived neural cell was found to have survived without any immunosuppression after one year of autologous transplant, highlighting the proof-of-concept around feasibility and safety of iPSC-derived transplantation for PD [10].",
        "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition involving destruction of the β-cells of the pancreas wherein transplantation with β-cells as islet tissues or the entire pancreas is suggested as an alternative over the traditional exogenous insulin supplementation. However, these come with risk of rejection, need of immunosuppression, apart from difficulty in the physiological control on blood glucose levels. To circumvent this block, generation of β-cells or islet tissues from human pluripotent stem cells like iPSCs has been attempted. Many studies have generated pancreatic β-like cells which secrete insulin in response to stimuli like potassium chloride [63]. However, co-excretion of glucagon, and somatostatin, apart from releasing unsuitable amounts of insulin; make these clinically inferior. iPSC-derived pancreatic endoderm cells have been shown to retain the potential to differentiate and are functionally comparable with adult β-cells. Further, the shortage of donor islet has been overcome using iPSCs, as pancreatic cells generated from these have been evaluated in clinical trials as a new source for transplantation therapy. The differentiation of iPSCs through mimicking the natural in vivo process was facilitated using a combination of growth factors including Nodal-activin, Wnt, retinoic acid, hedgehog, epidermal and fibroblast growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein, and Notch to activate as well as inhibit the key signaling pathway. This study thus highlighted the possibility of generating patient-specific fully functional pancreatic tissue for transplantation over donor islet for diabetes treatment [64].",
        "These studies highlight the development around iPSCs and transplantation technology for treatment of degenerative diseases as well as use them as disease models. The ability to generate patient-specific iPSC from skin biopsies, increases safety of autologous transplants without risk of immunorejection.",
        "The treatment for blood disorders involves need for mature red blood cells/erythrocytes from the bone marrow or umbilical cord blood, for blood transfusion, and is limited due to incompatibility in blood group and Rh antigens, and risk of infections [65]. Erythropoiesis is a complex process for generation of mature erythrocytes from the precursor erythroblasts that are difficult to culture in vitro, as the entire process occurs in the bone marrow mediated by complex interaction between cellular and extracellular environment involving hormones, cytokines, and growth factors [66]. Further, the fully differentiated red blood cells (RBCs) are not proliferative, and setting up a system for erythropoiesis-like maturation in precursor cells is a challenge. Further, recruitment of donors, need for rare blood group types, as well as safety in sensitive population groups, add to the roadblock [67]. Studies have investigated human pluripotent stem cells, including iPSCs as an alternative source for unlimited supply of functional erythrocytes. Studies have discussed different methods devised for RBC production, including using PSCs by repeating the developmental haematopoiesis; reprogramming somatic cells through transcription factors including OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC, KLF4, NANOG, LIN28; and stimulating the maturation of hematopoietic stem cells isolated from peripheral or umbilical cord blood [67,68]. The advantage of using iPSCs is their ability to differentiate into any cell type, and can be maintained indefinitely, thus becoming a potential source for cell replacement therapies. The potential of iPSc becomes highlighted by the fact that the French National Registry of People with a Rare Blood Phenotype/Genotype claims a single iPSc clone from their database could meet 73% of the needs of sickle cell disease patients [69]. This highlights that a limited number or RBC clones have the potential to supply to the majority needs of alloimmunized patients with rare blood groups.",
        "Studies have also worked on developing iPSC models for blood malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). A study worked on generating iPSC clones from bone marrow and blood of patients by integrating mutational analysis with cell programming to generate different iPSC clones which represent different disease stage as well as spectrum of the diseases including predisposition, low- and high-risk conditions. Additionally, the researchers also utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce as well as correct mutations in the iPSCs. This study found iPSC from AML patients upon differentiation exhibited the leukemic phenotype, and the derived hematopoietic stem cells contained two immunophenotypically distinct cell populations; an adherent and non-adherent fraction, wherein the adherent fraction cells continuously renewed and generated the non-adherent cells. The AML-iPSC thus generated was found to exhibit characteristics of the leukemia stem cell model thus becoming an efficient model for molecular analysis and studying key functional aspects to be utilized for developing better therapeutics [70]. In case of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the BCR-ABL gene fusion is the major disease driver, and treatment involves use of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), causing remission in the vast majority of the cases. Studies have shown the CML-iPSCs to not be affected by TKI even in presence of BCR-ABL expression, indicating absence of dependency in this state of differentiation. The CML-iPSCs factors essential for maintenance of BCR-ABL positive and iPSCs including phosphorylation of AKT, JNK, ERK1/2 remained unchanged while the expression of STAT5 and CRKL was decreased. Further, the hematopoietic cells derived from CML-iPSC regained TKI sensitivity thus facilitating understanding on the disease pathogenesis better [71,72]. In case of MDS, reprogramming to generate iPSCs has been done from patients with del7q mutation, which is the signature for the disease. The iPSCs with the mutation upon hematopoietic differentiation were found to generate low quantities of CD34+/CD45+ myeloid progenitor cells. Further, studying genetically engineered clones as well as the MDS-iPSC-del7q clone from the patient, the researchers functionally mapped MDS phenotype to regions 7q32.3–7q36.1, which is linked to loss of hematopoietic differentiation potential [73]. To highlight the efficiency of iPSC-technology in precision oncology, studies have also created isogenic iPSCs with del7q and mutation SRSF2 P95L, each of these connected to a specific phenotype and drug response [74].",
        "Human iPSC preclinical models also exist for monogenic blood disorders including thalassemia, and hemoglobinopathies for gene and cell therapy. Pilot trial investigations have explored the safety and effectiveness of mobilizing CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells in beta-thalassemia major adults. Further, the CD34+ were transduced with globin lentiviral vector, wherein the vector-encoded beta-chain was found to be expressed at normal hemizygous protein output levels in NSG mice. This trial thus validated an effective protocol for beta-globin gene transfer among thalassemia major CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells [75]. The risk of insertional mutagenesis using hematopoietic stem cells can be overcome through iPSCs which can be cloned and the clones with vector integration in the “safe harbor” sites become possible. The genomic safe harbors (GSHs) ensure that the inserted new genetic material functions as predicted, and do not cause any alterations to the host genome [76]. Studies have shown the use of gene editing tools in case of beta-thalassemia to not be successful in expression of beta-globin in the corrected locus, because of the developmental immaturity of the iPSCs. In such cases, insertion of globin gene copy in the GSH site like AAVS1 has been recommended as an alternative approach [77]. Human iPSC models for gene therapy have also been developed and studied for primary immunodeficiency syndromes, including chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) caused by mutations in genes which code for the phagocyte NADPH oxidase that produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that kill bacteria. Studies have shown genetically corrected CGD-iPSCs from macrophages and neutrophils using CRISPR/Cas9 system in the single intronic mutation of the CYBB gene to exhibit antimicrobial activity through generation of ROS and phagocytosis [78].",
        "Thus, the potential of iPSCs to study etiology of complex diseases which manifest late in life, as well as to identify markers for precision therapeutics, is worth exploring in the arena of clinical biomedical research. Human iPSC-based models are a true success in our understanding of disease pathogenesis away from the animal models.",
        "Organ donations are a key clinical need to treat end-stage organ failure conditions, and in often cases, patients are left to fight the acute shortage for the same. This apart, from identifying HLA-matched donors, handling risk of infections and rejection, as well as life-long immunosuppression, to a great extent damages quality of life for the affected as well as leads to loss of crucial time. Human iPSCs are being evaluated as a potential source for generating organs that can overcome roadblocks of shortage as well as risk of rejection. Studies have explored the possibility of generating a three-dimensional vascularized and functional liver organ from human iPSCs [79,80,81]. Generation of hepatocyte-like cells using iPSC technology has been reviewed to be fundamentally beneficial for treatment of severe liver disease, screening for drug toxicities, in liver transplantation, as well as to facilitate basic research [21]. Liver organogenesis involves delamination of specific hepatic cells from the foregut endodermal sheet to form a liver bud, which is then vascularized. One study prepared hepatic endoderm cells from human iPSCs through direct differentiation, wherein 80% of the treated cells were found to be positive for the cell fate determining hepatic marker; HNF4A. Further, to stimulate early organogenesis, the iPSCs were cocultured with stromal cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and human mesenchymal stem cells, and after 48h of seeding, the human iPSCs were found to be self-organized into three-dimensional cell clusters visible macroscopically. This iPSC-derived liver bud, when further assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarray assay for expression analysis, highlighted the pattern to be similar to human fetal liver cell-derived liver buds. Hemodynamic stimulation to form organ was done by cranial window model, and the iPSC-derived tissue was found to perform liver-specific functions including protein synthesis and human-drug specific metabolism actions. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential to use organ-bud transplantation for organ regeneration [82]. Figure 3 highlights the process of liver development and hepatic differentiation from hiPSCs.",
        "Hepatocytes represent 80% of the liver mass and are the specialized epithelial cells crucial for maintaining homeostasis. The hepatic differentiation involves induction of endoderm differentiation by activin A, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), and such generated hepatocytes have been found to retain features of human liver including lipid and glycogen storage, urea synthesis, etc. Cholangiocytes in the inner space of the bile duct tree have also been generated from the common progenitor hepatoblast, through downregulation of signaling factors including epidermal growth factor (EGF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), Jagged 1, sodium taurocholate, and the generated cholangiocytes have been detected to express mature markers including SOX9 (SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9), OPN (Osteopontin), CK7 (Cytokeratin 7), CK19 (Cytokeratin 19), etc. The kupffer cells are the largest population of resident macrophages in the human body and also facilitate liver regeneration after an ischemic injury. Studies have demonstrated generation of iPSC-derived kupffer cells from macrophage precursors by adding a hepatic stimulus [83,84].",
        "Another study evaluated lung regeneration by endogenous and exogenous stem cell mediated therapeutic approaches. Physiologically the tissue turnover rate in lung is slow and any insult to the regeneration process can lead to development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Bone marrow stem cells, embryonic stem cells, as well as iPSCs have shown excellent regenerative capacity to repair injured lung by generating whole lung in the lab using de-cellularized tissue scaffold and stem cells [85]. Lung organogenesis involves proximodistal patterning, branching morphogenesis, alveolarization, and cellular differentiation [86]. A study by Mou et al. [87], described generation of multipotent lung and airway progenitors from mouse ESCs and patient-specific cystic fibrosis (CF) iPSCs. The definitive endoderm from mouse ESCs were converted to foregut endoderm and then into replicating lung endoderm+Nkx2.1 (earliest marker of lung endoderm), which further transformed to a multipotent embryonic lung progenitor and airway progenitor cells. This study further highlighted that precise timing of the BMP, WNT, FGF signaling pathways are crucial for induction of NKX2.1. This study also utilized the same strategy to develop disease-specific lung progenitor cells from CF-iPSCs to make a model platform to study lung diseases. Further, the disease-specific lung progenitors were also engrafted in immunodeficient mice. One study derived lung progenitor cells with ~80% efficiency from iPSCs which differentiated onto alveolar epithelium both in vitro and in vivo. This study used Activin/BMP-4/bFGF treatment to obtain definitive endoderm from iPSC, which was further exposed to a series of pathway inhibitors (BMP, TGF-β, WNT), followed by longer exposure to FGF-19, KGF, BMP-4 and a small molecule CHIR99021 to mimic Wnt pathway to generate anterior foregut endoderm. The generated lung progenitors were further differentiated to many pulmonary progenitor cells including basal cells, goblet cells, ciliated cells, in vitro as well as in immunodeficient mice [88].",
        "Studies have also utilized iPSC-derived organ models to study pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). One study established a screening strategy to identify drugs that reduce angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) using human ESCs-derived cardiac cells and lung organoids, as the infection occurs due to binding of the virus to ACE2 on the cell membrane. Target analysis revealed treatment with antiandrogenic drugs to reduce ACE2 expression, thus protecting the lung organoids from the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical studies on COVID-19 identified patients with prostate disease, with elevated levels of circulating androgen to pose increased risk for high disease severity [89]. Another study utilized human lung stem-cell based alveolospheres to generate insights on SARS-CoV-2 mediated interferon response and pneumocyte dysfunction. This study described a chemically defined modular alveolosphere culture system for propagation and differentiation of the human alveolar type 2 (AT2) derived from primary lung tissue. The cultured cells were found to express ACE2 and transcriptome analysis of the infected alveolospheres were found to mirror features of the COVID-19 infected human lung, together with the interferon-mediated inflammatory response, loss of surfactant proteins, and apoptosis. Further, infected alveolospheres when treated with low dose interferons, a reduction in viral replication was noted. Thus, human stem-cell based models have also added insight to COVID-19 pathogenesis [90]. In case of use of iPSC three-dimensional model, a study by Huang et al. [91] found the derived AT2 to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 with decreased expression of surfactant proteins, and cell death, exhibiting delayed type I interferon response with multiplicities of infection of 5 and interferon-stimulated genes. Another study assessed inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection using lung and colonic organoids from the gut. The derived iPSCs in three-dimensional, were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In case of immune response, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) signatures were noted after 24 h with multiplicities of infection of 0.1. This study also screened US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved entry inhibitors including imatinib, mycophenolic acid, and quinacrine dihydrochloride; wherein treatment at physiologically relevant levels highlighted inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection both in iPSC-lung organoids and colonoids, indicating that iPSC models also prove to be a valuable source for safe drug screening [92].",
        "Development of organ-specific progenitor cells which progress into the complete three-dimensional organ in a lab highlights the potential of iPSCs in regenerative medicine. Further, the impact of organ-system models to study infection pathology, highlights the wide clinical arena in which iPSC-technology can be used.",
        "The iPSCs have been generated for modelling pathogenesis of many diseases, and one of the most notable additions to the same is cancer, including models for familial cancer syndromes. One such study reports on the successful establishment of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) patient-derived iPSC to study role of p53 in development of osteosarcoma. LFS being a heterogenous cancer condition, osteosarcoma is one of the types wherein relevance of germline p53 mutations have been highly reported. The pre-existing murine LFS models have been insufficient in charting the entire tumor landscape and patient-derived iPSCs in this regard have demonstrated the feasibility to effectively study human cancer syndromes. Studies have found the LFS-derived mesenchymal stem cells to exhibit low expression of targets of p53 including p21 and MDM2; highlighting their ability to retain the defective p53 function from the parental fibroblasts. Further, p53 knockdown was found to cause upregulation of osteogenic markers in LFS osteoblasts, and the possibility to attain osteosarcoma-related phenotypes in LFS iPSC-derived osteoblasts was found. Further, gene expression analysis in LFS-derived osteoblasts was found to correlate with poor patient survival, and decreased time for recurrence. The impaired H19 restoration was also found to repress tumorigenic potential [36]. Another study involving modelling of osteosarcoma from LFS derived-iPSC identified the LFS osteoblasts to recapitulate oncogenic properties of osteosarcoma proving to be an excellent model to study disease pathogenesis [93]. In case of Noonan syndrome (NS) characterized by germline PTPN11 mutations, studies which have derived hiPSCs from hematopoietic cells and which harbor the PTPN11 mutations were found to successfully recapitulate features of NS. The iPSC-derived NS myeloid cells were found to exhibit increased STAT5 signaling and enhanced expression of micro-RNAs viz. miR-223 and miR-15a. Further, reducing miR-223 function was found to normalize myelogenesis, highlighting the role of micro-RNA dysregulation in early oncogenesis [94]. Human iPSC-derived hereditary cancer models have also aided in identifying BRCA1-deleted tumor niche to be the cause for disease progression [95].",
        "The iPSC models around cancer aid in overcoming the hurdles posed by traditional cancer cell line systems, which may lose the characteristics of the original tumor with time, and further harnessing primary cancer cells at different stages of carcinogenesis is not feasible. The established iPSC reprogramming strategies can aid in differentiation of cancer cells to target cell lineages which can aid in studying each of the different stages in cancer progression [96]. The iPSCs developed from primary tumors, as well as cancer cell lines are invaluable tools to study genetic alterations early-on in familial cancer syndromes which is crucial in understand disease pathogenesis. Apart from cancer cell lines, patient-derived xenograft models have also been proven to be efficacious for understanding tumor heterogeneity, genetic alterations, and testing efficacy of cytotoxic drugs. However, the need for successful engraftment, technical challenges, and variable growth rates, are the key limitations. Even in case of animal models, high rate of mortality, and absence of metastasis are the limitations [97,98,99]. Advancements in iPSC models have also led researchers to be able to design autologous iPSC-based vaccine which presents a broad spectrum of tumor antigens to the immune system of the mice, and also found success in eliciting a prophylactic reaction against multiple cancer types. These studies highlight the great promise iPSC-based autologous vaccines present towards cancer prevention as well as therapy [100].",
        "The iPSCs plug the very fundamental requirement for advancing scientific and clinical research by aiding insight into the fundamental growth and regenerative processes that happen early-on in life. They have emerged as an efficient alternative to ESC in clinical settings especially for screening new pharmaceutical compounds. The ability to produce patient-specific iPSCs has made studying disease pathogenesis and experiments around treating and managing inherited disease conditions, a close reality. They provide an unlimited repertoire of highly differentiated cells from focus area, fueling multiple investigations without roadblock on availability. The fact that iPSCs have also demonstrated success in treating few conditions including substantial correction of SCA and FA, highlights their therapeutic potential [101]. With organ engineering, using patient-specific iPSCs, the possibility to produce animal-free meat are also few areas which are being rapidly explored. The areas where iPSCs have proven impact on investigations as well as therapeutics highlights the potential of the instrument in various fields of biomedicine. Research around safe application and minimizing involvement of animal cells is crucial to enhance usability factor among humans. The ability to generate and use iPSCs derived from large animals (e.g., non-human primates, swine, horses, sheep, and canines), being highly similar and homogenous to the human microenvironment, is currently made available along with simultaneous generation of resources for improvement of animal welfare.",
        "Scientific and technological advancements have also aided in designing high throughput drug screening systems based on hiPSC stem cell-derived atrial myocytes for detecting cardiac toxicity in atrial arrhythmias. The platform established by human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes was found to be useful in detecting propensity for drug-induced tachyarrhythmias [102]. The potential of iPSCs have also empowered COVID-19 studies wherein iPSC-derived airway epithelial cells were successfully developed to models consisting of cell types found in human upper airway epithelium. Further, the cells were found to secrete mucus and also exhibited positive for infection with COVID-19. The infected model also exhibited cytokine production at levels similar to a human infected body. This study highlights the significance of upper respiratory airway models in studying respiratory viral infections [103].",
        "Although the impressive prospects of iPSC in clinical settings have been proven, the challenges that need to be realized and worked upon include tumorigenicity, heterogeneity, and immunogenicity. Teratoma formation continues to be serious challenge and a limiting factor in hiPSC transplantation. Though there are multiple elimination methods including cell sorting systems, antibody conjugates, the risk of tumor arising from proliferating progeny still exists. These apart, the reprogramming factors, and occurrence of genetic alterations during in vitro culturing also add to risk of tumorigenicity. Immunogenicity characterized by rejection especially in allograft transplantation deems the need to use immunosuppressants. Heterogeneity has also been reported as a limitation in iPSC which to a great extent is an outcome of genetics and differences in gene expression [104]. Apart from these, studies have also noted variability and reproducibility of results across multiple laboratories as a drawback. Different reprogramming methods, chromosomal instability, can impact the phenotype of the generated iPSC. Further, many protocols described and published today to a great extent result in formation of immature iPSCs and the existing advancements for inducing phenotype-specific maturation has been recorded to involve few months. Further, the need for broad range of iPSCs with respect to disease as well as cohort used for iPSC generation is a need [105].",
        "Induced pluripotent stem cells are also now being investigated in clinical trials for diseases and one such involves the Hirschsprung disease initiated in the year 2020. This case-control involves use of patient-derived iPSCs to develop models of the disease to understand genetic factors contributing to disease pathogenesis [106]. The global distribution of clinical studies indicates United States of America (USA) to be leading in the numbers at 36%, followed by France and China at 15%, and 12% respectively. Further, in case of interventional studies involving re-transplantation of the generated iPSCs into humans, China was found to be leading at 36.7%, while records find USA to have 16.7%. In case of target disease conditions being investigated, ophthalmic diseases ranked highest at 24.4%, followed by non-communicable ailments at 22.1%, cardiovascular diseases at 14.5%, and neurological diseases at 13% [107]. Few clinical trials involving ESCs/iPSCs have been listed in Table 3.",
        "Human iPSCs have become a powerful tool in basic as well as translational and clinical research because of their ability to be maintained indefinitely whilst preserving the genetic makeup of the host. Further, technological advancements which enable genetic manipulation of iPSCs, ensure they become a rich repertoire for cell replacement therapy. Identification of GSH regions further adds to the feasibility to reduce risk of transplantation to a great extent. Their ability to provide cell-specific information, makes studying interaction between genetics, epigenetics, as well as extracellular environment a possibility. Complex relationships involving multiple cell types becomes dissectible with iPSC-models, and their ability to harbor large chromosomal alterations as well as deletions, makes them a favorable model for cancer studies. Though highly researched upon, the technological advancements to decipher the impact of genetic and epigenetic alterations as well as variability in cell clones or colonies is still naïve. Moreover, development of engraftable cell lines need to be devised considering the safety and efficacy aspect.",

        "The brain, being an intricate part of the central nervous system (CNS), is responsible for integrating and regulating information in the nervous system along with the spinal cord. Injuries to the CNS caused by diseases, disorders, or accidents are very critical due to the limited regenerative capacity of CNS tissues, intricate neural circuitry, and complex inflammatory responses. The presence of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) restricts the entry of therapeutic agents into the CNS, and the formation of glial scars at the lesion can hinder axonal regrowth. Secondary injury processes, including excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, further exacerbate damage. Timing of therapeutic interventions, heterogeneity of injuries, ethical concerns, and patient‐specific variability add to the complexity. Moreover, stroke, trauma, and a variety of neurodegenerative disorders can cause damage and death of neuronal tissue in the CNS. In view of the limited regenerative capacity of the CNS, damage to the CNS tissue can have severe consequences on the individual. Since CNS injuries have a profound impact on our society and existing pharmacological treatments are not effective enough, novel therapeutic approaches that target the regeneration of CNS tissue are essential.\n1",
        "To address and facilitate the recovery of the impaired CNS, cell‐based repair has emerged as a mechanism for replacing damaged or degenerating cells and repairing CNS tissues. The therapeutic potential of cell‐based therapies lies in the reconstruction of damaged circuitry via (a) replacement of damaged neurons directly, (b) secretion of therapeutic factors enhancing neuroprotection, anti‐inflammatory effects, or enhanced angiogenesis in the pathological host environment, and (c) creating an environment that promotes neuroplasticity in the host. This cell‐based repair strategy encompasses the utilization of cellular entities to substitute impaired or depleted brain cells. This method entails employing either autologous cells, derived from the patient's own body, or allogeneic cells sourced from a donor.\n2\n Stem cells, characterized by their undifferentiated nature with the capacity to develop into diverse cell lineages, stand as a potential cell source for this therapeutic approach. The strategy of implementing cell‐based therapy can be executed via direct cerebral injection of cells at the injury site.\n3\n The therapeutic benefits of cell repair have been demonstrated in numerous preclinical studies, and its effectiveness is currently being evaluated in several clinical trials.\n1\n However, despite the progression of cell‐based CNS reparation as a therapeutic strategy throughout the years, substantial barriers, including immune rejection, difficulty in targeting specific brain regions, and potential risks of tumorigenesis, have impeded its widespread implementation in clinical settings. Hence, as an alternate, cell‐based biomaterials like hydrogels, constituting gel‐like substances amenable to injection into the brain, offer a platform to facilitate cellular proliferation and viability.\n4\n Hydrogels have demonstrated their suitability as biomaterials for brain tissue regeneration due to their unique characteristics. These materials feature three‐dimensional crosslinked polymer networks with a water content exceeding 90%. Additionally, hydrogels offer adjustable physicochemical properties, enabling them to conform to irregular brain cavities effectively. They create a favorable microenvironment conducive to the growth and proliferation of nerve cells. Furthermore, their porous internal structure imparts softness and flexibility, minimizing tissue damage during application. These hydrogels furnish a scaffold for cellular growth and afford immunoprotection to the cells. Beyond the mere replacement of damaged cells, cell‐based hydrogels also possess the capability to induce repair and regeneration of compromised brain tissue. This outcome may arise through the secretion of growth factors or other signaling molecules by the transplanted cells or by instigating the patient's endogenous cells into restoring and regenerating the afflicted tissue.\n5\n, \n6",
        "Traditionally, highly viscous noninjectable hydrogels like polyethylene glycol (PEG) and poly 2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate hydrogels (poly‐HEMA) have been employed to treat CNS injuries and are adapted for tissue engineering purposes. These hydrogels are modified with substances like arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) and natural materials such as alginate, gelatin, agarose, hyaluronic acid (HA), and chitosan to enhance cell adhesion, making them effective biomaterial scaffolds for treating brain lesions. However, their physical properties limit their application, with systemic or direct brain administration causing cell loss or dispersion. Attempts to scale up vascular transport during implantation can worsen cerebral ischemia due to blood flow obstruction during open surgery or incisions. Moreover, implanted biomaterials often trigger neuro‐immune reactions, disrupting the BBB and causing inflammation with plasma and peripheral blood cells entering the ventricle. In the context of CNS injury, injectable biomaterials may be used to repair or replace damaged tissue or to deliver drugs or other therapeutic agents to specific locations within the brain.\n7\n Nanoparticles (NPs) and microparticles are also potent injectable biomaterials used for brain injury repair. These particles have advantageous properties such as smaller size, shape, and structure.\n8\n It is easier to introduce them into biomaterial matrix containing stem cells, which offers a beneficial mechanism for continuous and smooth delivery of medication.",
        "Injectable hydrogels as potential biomaterials offer several potential advantages for the treatment of CNS injury. They can be designed to release drugs or other agents over a controlled period of time, allowing for sustained therapeutic effects.\n9\n They can also be designed to be biocompatible and biodegradable since they are not harmful to the body and can be safely broken down and eliminated after use. In addition, injectable biomaterials may be able to cross the BBB, the protective layer of cells surrounding the brain.\n10\n Overall, injectable biomaterials hold great promise as a means of treating CNS injury and improving the lives of individuals affected by these conditions. On this basis, this comprehensive review is drafted to provide an overview of different CNS conditions that require cell reparation. It also explores the potential biomaterial methodologies that can enhance the efficacy of treating brain injuries. Moreover, this narrative review covers various aspects of the topic, including the current state of research, available interventions, challenges, and advancements in the field.",
        "All relevant information concerning injectable biomaterials for CNS injury was collected from published literature in the English language. Published preclinical and clinical study results were reported in the current study.

        "These injuries can result in paralysis and loss of sensation due to damage to the spinal cord. Cell‐based therapies, such as the transplantation of neural stem cells, have been shown to promote nerve regrowth and improve functional recovery in animal studies. Several methods of cell transplantation are being explored as therapeutic strategies for SCI, including modulating the host immune response, enhancing axonal plasticity, providing neurotrophic support, and replacing damaged cells.\n18\n It has been demonstrated that neural progenitor cells are effective at improving motor function and forming synaptic connections between grafted neurons and host neurons when transplanted into rodent and nonhuman primate models of severe SCI. In the case of SCI, numerous stem cells, including neural stem cells (NSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), Wharton jelly stem cells, adipose‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs), umbilical cord blood stem cells (UCB‐SCs), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), umbilical cord‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC‐MSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have been shown to be effective in the repair of SCI. Constructed NSCs‐derived neural network tissue with strong survival within an NT‐3/fibroin‐coated gelatin sponge (NF‐GS) scaffold, modified by tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC). After receiving tissue from neural networks produced from NSCs that had been transformed by TrkC, SCI‐affected rats' recovery of motor function was noticeably enhanced. Together, the findings revealed that a useful method for researching and creating SCI treatments involves transplanting the neural network tissue created in the three‐dimensional (3D) bioactive scaffold.\n19\n, \n20\n Moreover, the synergistic application involves the coalescence of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)‐derived neural stem cells (iNSCs) with a 3D construct of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel, aimed at fostering regenerative processes subsequent to SCI. A mouse spinal cord transection model was created to evaluate the GelMA hydrogels' impact on in vivo neuronal regeneration. Implants made of GelMA/iNSC greatly aided functional recovery. Additional histological examination revealed that the GelMA/iNSC group had much smaller cavity regions and less collagen was deposited. Additionally, the combination of GelMA and iNSC transplantation reduced inflammation by lowering active macrophages/microglia (CD68‐positive cells). Furthermore, the implantation of GelMA/iNSC showcased noteworthy therapeutic outcomes by forestalling the formation of glial scars and GFAP‐positive cells, concomitantly fostering the regeneration of axons. The utilization of this tridimensional hydrogel laden with stem cells stands undoubtedly as a prospective therapeutic modality for SCI reparation.\n21\n Notably, rats afflicted with SCI and subjected to a dual intervention involving edaravone injection alongside Schwann cell transplantation exhibited enhanced neurological functionality coupled with the regrowth of nerve fibers.\n22\n A typical representation of the delivery of stem cells into the brain is represented in Figure 1.",

        "TBI is still a leading cause of mortality and disability, affecting an estimated 10 million individuals each year. TBI is a disease that destroys normal brain function and produces major physical, cognitive, and emotional problems. TBI pathophysiology consists mostly of a breach of the BBB, widespread neuro‐inflammation, diffuse axonal damage, and neurodegenerative abnormalities.\n23\n Preclinical research has demonstrated the potential therapeutic usefulness of stem cell therapy. In preclinical research, neuroprotective and regenerative capabilities of stem cells have been proposed as the mechanism of action.\n24\n In recent years, research has discovered that a number of stem cells, including MSCs, NSCs, multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), and EPCs, can heal neurological damage following TBI.\n25\n STEMTRA, a recently completed phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02416492) that observed the potential effects of intracranial administration of bone marrow‐derived cells on patients with chronic motor deficit from TBI, discovered that significantly more patients receiving cell treatment showed enhanced motor status at 6 months in comparison to the patients receiving a control sham.\n10",
        "Strokes are the third most common cause of disability and the second most common cause of mortality worldwide. Stroke, being the major cause of depression and dementia, causes brain cells to die suddenly due to lack of oxygen flow to the brain.\n26\n Merely two treatments possess approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke, namely tissue plasminogen activator and thrombectomy. Remarkably, despite being the second leading cause of both mortality and enduring incapacitation on a global scale, the available therapeutic options remain limited. As a multimodal therapy with the potential to produce neuroprotective and regenerative growth factors as well as potentially acting as cell replacement for lost and injured brain cell types, NSCs have attracted a lot of attention.\n27\n NSCs‐based therapy may be significant among cell types due to its capacity for neuronal differentiation, as well as its capacity to promote endogenous neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and the control of the neuro‐inflammatory system.\n28\n, \n29\n Although cell‐based therapy may be an effective stroke treatment, there are still numerous obstacles to overcome, such as poor transplanted cell yields and the heterogeneity of the disease and injured tissue.",
        "PD is an incurable condition that causes the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta to degenerate locally. Many of the PD treatments available today can only treat the symptoms, not the underlying neurodegeneration that causes PD. MSCs, ESCs, NSCs, and iPSCs‐based cell treatment have been the subject of numerous animal research.\n30\n, \n31\n The efficacy of cell replacement therapy for PD is widely supported by these preclinical investigations, providing a viable substitute for pharmaceutical therapies. Additionally, cell repair has been used in numerous clinical investigations for PD. For instance, the European research group TRANSEURO was founded in 2010 (NCT01898390) to examine the therapeutic effectiveness of utilizing transplants of the fetal ventral mesencephalon to replace cells in PD.\n10\n, \n32\n Using iPSCs, recent developments in the fields of cellular reprogramming and personalized medicine now enable the development of cell therapies that were previously unreachable and the patient‐specific modeling of PD using iPSCs.\n33\n iPSCs can be specifically differentiated to become dopaminergic neurons, which are prone to neurodegeneration naturally. The first striking human trial for iPSC transplantation in PD started in Japan in 2018. One of the strongest possibilities for slowing or perhaps reversing the progression of PD at the moment is this type of cell treatment, which has demonstrated encouraging outcomes in other model organisms.\n34",
        "AD is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid (Aβ) plaques that eventually form in degenerating neurons of the aged brain.

Despite the development of several cholinesterase inhibitors, N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, and monoclonal antibodies to prevent neurodegeneration, trigger neural regeneration, or clear up Aβ deposits, none of the treatments are helpful in alleviating the cognitive and memory dysfunctions of AD patients. As a result, stem cell therapy represents a potent treatment option for AD.\n35\n, \n36\n AD stem cell sources include NSCs, ESCs, and MSCs derived from bone marrow, umbilical cord, and umbilical cord blood. Patient‐specific iPSCs in particular are presented as a future potential and a challenge for the treatment of AD.\n37\n, \n38\n As a replacement or regeneration method, stem cell‐based treatment provides new promise for AD treatment. MSCs are multipotent stem cells with immunomodulatory capabilities and excellent biosafety, as well as the potential to synthesize neurotrophic and proangiogenic molecules, making them effective for neuro‐regeneration.\n39\n In the instance of AD, MSCs‐based therapies have demonstrated the ability to heal damaged brain tissue while also slowing disease progression. Although the exact treatment mechanism effect of stem cell transplantation is unknown, MSCs therapy has demonstrated to be an alternative therapeutic option for neurodegenerative illnesses such as AD. Several clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the utility of MSC infusions in patients with AD.\n40\n For example, the Korean business Medipost conducted a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02054208) in patients with AD to evaluate intra‐ventricular delivery of a product named NEUROSTEM®, (UCB‐MSCs). Another product, Astro Stem, employs ADMSCs and will shortly be evaluated in patients with AD in a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04482413).\n10\n Similarly, NSCs transplantation, which targets both neuron networks and pathogenic proteins, has a positive effect on behavior and the microenvironment. NSCs stimulate endogenous synaptogenesis, which improves cognition. However, it is challenging to correctly characterize NSCs' positive effects in AD.\n41",
        "Exceeding a global count of 2 million individuals, MS affects a substantial populace and manifests as a persistent inflammatory disorder of the CNS. The intricate nature of MS arises from the interplay between genetic propensities and environmental hazards, contributing to its onset. A variation of the HLA‐DRB1 gene of the major histocompatibility complex is the key genetic determinant linked to MS susceptibility, but there are numerous other minor genetic risk factors as well.\n42\n, \n43\n The term “stem cell therapy” refers to a vast field that includes the therapeutic transplantation of numerous stem/progenitor cell types derived from diverse tissues into potential patients. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transplantation\n44\n is presently the only method with clinical validation in this area. This method, which is frequently used to treat hematologic malignancies including multiple myeloma and leukemia, is also showing amazing results in patients with active RRMS who do not react to DMTs.\n45",
        "In the context of CNS injury, injectable biomaterials serve the purpose of repairing or replacing damaged tissue. Additionally, they enable precise drug delivery to specific locations within the brain. Different biomaterials including cell‐based hydrogels, microparticles, NPs are effectively used for targeted delivery of therapeutics to the brain, which are discussed as follows. Moreover, a pictorial representation illustrating the characteristics and similarities and differences of these biomaterials is shown in Figure 2.",

        "The brain is an intricate part of the CNS, responsible for integrating and regulating information in the nervous system along with the spinal cord. Injuries to the CNS due to diseases, disorders, or accidents are very critical as it hardly regenerates.\n46\n The rapid movement of astrocytes towards injured sites prevents further damage to the neural network by forming glial scars around the injured sites. The brain damage became irreversible due to inadequate regeneration of neurons and axons and the development of glial scars at the lesion.\n47\n Facilitating the recovery of neuron and axon regeneration by NSCs transplantation along with inhibitory antibodies is quite a hurdle, preventing its pervasive clinical practice.\n48\n However, due to inadequate physical support to the lesion as well as microenvironment cherishing the cell growth makes neural cell transplantation scant for substantial brain injury. A variety of biomaterials with physicochemical properties that can be altered in response to the environment, such as malleable biodegradability, tissue‐like mechanical properties with structural resemblance to extracellular matrix (ECM), pertinent bioactivity, and cytocompatibility, have emerged into focus for the purpose of providing a microenvironment for cell growth and tissue regeneration of soft tissue, bone, and the peripheral nervous system as well as the CNS.\n49\n, \n50\n The ideal material for regenerating brain tissue has proven to be hydrogels, as they contain 3‐dimensional crosslinked polymer networks with a water content above 90%. Moreover, hydrogels possess adjustable physicochemical properties for filling the irregular cavity in the brain. It can also provide a favorable microenvironment for nerve cell growth and proliferation; apart from that, the porous internal structure provides its softness and suppleness, leading to the minimization of tissue damage.\n10\n Traditionally, non‐injectable, very viscous hydrogels have been used to treat CNS injuries. In tissue engineering, such hydrogels are frequently converted into external wound dressings or implantable biomaterial scaffolds.\n51\n Noninjectable hydrogels with mechanical qualities like those of brain tissue are commonly utilized in the regeneration of brain tissues, which includes PEG and poly‐HEMA. After being modified with the RGD sequence and natural substances including alginate, gelatin, agarose, hyaluronic acid (HA), and chitosan, the capacity of hydrogels to adhere to cells dramatically increases, enhancing their effectiveness as biomaterial scaffolds for treating brain lesions.\n52\n However, the physical characteristics of non‐injectable hydrogels limit the range of applications, when administered systemically or directly into the brain, most transplanted cells perish or spread to the peripheral organs. Furthermore, scaling up vascular transport of stem/progenitor cells might aggravate cerebral ischemia by obstructing blood flow to the brain, since implantation is only possible through an open surgery or requires a substantial incision to be made.\n53\n Also, the implanted biomaterials frequently cause neuro‐immune reactions, causing the BBB to be broken and plasma and peripheral blood cells to enter the ventricle. Inflammation and neuro‐immune reactions can be brought on by an influx of fluid and peripheral blood cells, such as lymphocytes and macrophages.\n54\n Drugs or cells can be directly delivered by injectable hydrogels to the damaged area of the brain, protecting the BBB. The CNS may be treated with drugs using injectable hydrogels, and neuronal stem cells can be transported using these hydrogels as scaffolds.\n55\n As minimally invasive surgery continues to advance, the usage of injectable hydrogels adapts to the brain's environment and satisfies the evolving needs of biomaterials for smaller surgical sites. The in situ injection of hydrogels promotes gelation, which results in the clearing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and restricts extensive dissemination to maintain local release of hydrogel in the lesion region, might be accelerated by revamping the physical and chemical characteristics.\n56\n, \n57\n With every new technological advancement, hydrogels design quickly develops, enhancing every component of cell repair (cell adhesion, biological signals) to deliver the most effective neuroprotective result to the targeted cells.",
        "Novel drug administration of liposomes, polymeric micelles, and NPs have the potentials to be powerful tools for addressing CNS injuries. NPs containing germane molecules are suitable biomolecules, and an important resource for in situ administration in the CNS. Because of their tiny size, encapsulated biomolecules containing active chemicals can traverse the BBB, improving pharmacological profile while limiting toxicity.\n58\n Due to limited regenerative impact of delivering biomolecules alone in damaged tissue, nanoparticle unaided approach is not befitting for tissue regeneration in CNS. However, the potential of micro‐carriers and other microscale materials for cell‐based brain healing in the brain has been demonstrated by a variety of research.",
        "Formulations of polymeric micro/nanoparticles for the controlled release of hydrophobic and hydrophilic biomolecular medicines have been extensively developed. The preservation of biomolecule activity and biomolecule diffusion from the delivery site to the target site are challenges in the design of micro/nanoparticle formulations for CNS regeneration. The majority of micro/nanoparticles deployed in the CNS are made of poly‐lactic‐co‐glycolic acid (PLGA), a biodegradable polymer that has been recognized for use in medicine. After being injected into tissue for CNS distribution, PLGA micro‐particles cause a modest microglial/astroglial response and can linger there for up to 4 months.\n59\n, \n60\n The use of nerve growth factor (NGF) or GDNF‐containing PLGA micro‐particles for the treatment of PD, AD, and retinal degeneration is widespread.\n58\n The neurotrophins were released in vitro over a period of 6 weeks with a high burst release typical of PLGA micro‐particles, and this led to both tissue regeneration and functional gains. It is undesirable because surfactants can be cytotoxic that high quantities of surfactants were needed to disperse the micro‐particles for injection.\n61\n Another strategy is to distribute both cells and medicinal compounds using pharmacologically active micro‐carriers. One such instance is the in vitro seeding and in vivo transplantation of fetal ventral mesencephalic transplants in the hemi‐Parkinsonian rat striatum using PLGA micro‐carriers functionalized with GDNF.\n62\n, \n63\n This method increased the cells’ capacity for functional function as well as for reinnervation and survival. In preclinical models of stroke, pharmacologically active micro‐carriers have also been employed to increase the reparative capability of a population of MSCs known as marrow‐isolated adult multilineage inducible (MIAMI) cells,\n63\n, \n64\n PD\n62\n and Huntington's disease.\n65\n Apart from that another approach was made earlier to embryonic rat hippocampal neurons which were effectively matured and transplanted into the adult rat hippocampus using colloidal glass microbeads.\n66",
        "Approaches are being developed to combine micro/nanoparticles acting like carriers along with cell‐loaded hydrogels, such as the preparation of a MnO2 NPs dotted hydrogels involve dispersing MnO2 NPs in a PPFLMLLKGSTR peptide in modified hydrogels made of hyaluronic acid. MSCs can adhere to the hydrogels' surface and bridge nerve tissue with it. The MnO2 NPs successfully increase MSCs viability by reducing the oxidative environment. On a long‐span rat spinal cord transection model, MSCs transplantation results in a significant recovery of motor function. It also causes in vivo integration and neural differentiation of the implanted MSCs, which results in a highly effective regeneration of CNS spinal cord tissues. Therefore, by the thorough management of pathological microenvironment problems, the MnO2 NPs dotted hydrogels represents a promising technique for stem‐cell‐based therapy of CNS illnesses.\n67\n Also, a significant potential has been introduced to treat pathological imbalance of zinc during epilepsy and dementia by using a hydrogel made of HA generated from skeletal muscle, ZnONPs are delivered locally to the damaged spinal cord (ZnONPs‐Gel). In this study, ZnONPs‐Gel implantation successfully restored hindlimb motor function in SCI mice by controlling the focal microenvironment and reducing reactive oxygen species and inflammation. This work created a novel method for administering ZnONPs locally to treat SCI.\n68\n The hydrogels maintain the cells and particles in the treatment location while the particles provide a continuous, long‐term release of the biomolecules, such as neurotrophic factors to boost cell survival. This synergistic method offers several benefits. Numerous research on PD have demonstrated the positive effects of neuronal cell transplantation on GDNF‐rich scaffolds, which enhance survival and functional recovery.\n69\n Although the primary goal of utilizing nanoparticles is often to increase cell survival, therapeutic molecules can also be utilized to improve other features, such as angiogenesis by introducing, for example, VEGF in the wounded site.\n70\n, \n71",
        "Injectable hydrogels extensively used in brain injury research are classified into natural injectable hydrogels, synthetic hydrogels and self‐assembled or mixed hydrogels. Each category possesses unique attributes that make them suitable for specific applications. They differ in terms of their composition, origin, properties, and applications that are well‐discussed within this review.",
        "Natural injectable hydrogels, derived from biocompatible materials like cellulose, hyaluronic acid, collagen, chitosan, and others closely mimic the native CNS extracellular matrix. Their inherent biocompatibility and biodegradability make them an attractive choice for CNS repair. These hydrogels foster neural regeneration by creating a conducive microenvironment, promoting cell adhesion, and minimizing immune responses. The most commonly used natural hydrogel materials in tissue engineering are based on the natural components of ECM, such as cellulose, hyaluronic acid, chitosan, collagen, alginate, and gelatin,\n72\n, \n73\n which are discussed in detail below.",
        "Aside from its low immunogenicity and 3D structure, native ECM hydrogels have a multitude of biomolecules, including cytokines and chemical substances that stimulate cell growth and differentiation.\n49\n, \n74\n ECM is generally digested with pepsin and decellularized to prepare injectable ECM. Materials for preparing ECM hydrogels fall under two categories, namely, (a) nerve tissues and (b) non‐nerve tissues.\n50\n, \n75\n A study by Ghuman et al.\n76\n developed an injectable fluid by preparing ECM from pig bladder, exposing it to 4% ethanol, decellularizing it with 0.1% acetic acid, and lysing it with pepsin at a temperature of 21°C. The biodegradation rate of ECM hydrogels, the degree to which endogenous cells and nerve cells penetrated the materials, and the degree to which tissues were modified around the apoplexy cavity were determined by injecting different concentrations of the hydrogels into apoplexy rats' brains. The results of these studies indicate that injectable ECM hydrogels in the dosage of 4 mg/ml can result in maximum tissue regeneration in the brain. After 14 days of implantation, 80% of the ECM hydrogels degraded at a rate of 6.11 litres per day. There was a steady infiltration level of macrophages in the hydrogels that could be maintained at 700–800 cells/μL. It has been reported that the remaining hydrogels became denser with mature nerve cells after 90 days of injection which is a sign of tissue transformation and regeneration.\n76\n Such hydrogels functions as a supportive scaffold when injected into damaged neural tissue, providing a conducive microenvironment for cell attachment, proliferation, and survival. This biomimetic platform promotes neuroplasticity, aids axonal regeneration by guiding nerve fibers,\n74\n modulates immune responses to curb excessive inflammation, and can deliver bioactive molecules to facilitate tissue healing. Through these mechanisms, injectable ECM holds potential for ameliorating debilitating neurological conditions by promoting repair and functional recovery within the nervous system.\n49\n, \n50",
        "The polysaccharide HA is highly aqueous with repeated and alternate disaccharide units, mostly located in the brain and the ECM.\n77\n, \n78\n The biocompatibility and biodegradability of HA makes it ideal for use as a base for the development of new biologics. Additionally, it is used for cell transplantation, or it can be used on its own as a biological scaffold.\n51\n It exerts potential neuroprotective effects by modulating neuroinflammation and promoting tissue repair. Through interactions with CD44 receptors, HA regulates immune responses and dampens inflammation, thus reducing neuronal damage. Moreover, the viscoelastic properties of HA can contribute to tissue restoration by providing structural support and promoting cellular regeneration in debilitating neurological conditions.\n51\n, \n78\n Studies have prepared HA‐based hydrogels by crosslinking MMPase peptides with acrylate and adding HA to the main chain. It is possible to mimic brain mechanical properties by varying the cross‐linking agents.\n52\n According to a study, human pluripotent stem cells injected into stroke mice stimulated differentiation of the cells, but after 1 week, the hydrogels failed to improve the survival of stem cells.\n53\n In contrast, in another study, HA hydrogels containing brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were injected into the cranial cavities of mice within a week of stroke. The group receiving HA hydrogels combined with BDNF resulted in a significantly higher number of new neurons in contrast to the control group following 9 weeks of stroke.\n54\n This suggested that HA hydrogels with BDNF significantly increased the number of new neurons in the brain.",
        "In addition to these pros, Ho et al.\n55\n reported that hyaluronic acid‐methylcellulose (HAMC) hydrogels, which are HA based physical cross‐linking hydrogels, cause severe damage to the CNS. It was reported that erythropoietin delivered via hydrogels to the cerebral cortex of stroke induced mice resulted in a significant increase in neurons, a decrease in inflammation, a reduction in stroke lumen size, and migratory neuroblast proliferation in the inferior ventricle.\n55",
        "Chitosan, a natural polymer mainly composed of d‐glucosamine and randomly linked β‐(1‐4) units of N‐acetyl‐d‐glucosamine, is recognized as the most abundant polysaccharide after cellulose for its biodegradability, biocompatibility, non‐allergenicity, non‐toxicity, resistance to oxidation, antibacterial and anti‐inflammatory properties.\n56\n It has shown potentials in mitigating debilitating neurological conditions through several mechanisms. Firstly, chitosan's positively charged amino groups can interact with negatively charged molecules, potentially reducing the aggregation of misfolded proteins implicated in neurological conditions like AD. Secondly, its anti‐inflammatory properties may modulate neuroinflammatory responses, offering neuroprotection. Lastly, chitosan‐based drug delivery systems could enhance the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents across the BBB, facilitating treatment strategies for neurological disorders.\n56\n, \n58\n However, for chitosan‐based biomaterials, functionalization is necessary to address its low solubility and poor mechanical properties. For instance, adding succinic or ferulic acid to chitosan hydrogels injection and administering it to Wistar rats demonstrated adequate biocompatibility. This suggests the potential application of functionalized chitosan hydrogels to treat CNS injuries.\n57\n Tseng and his colleagues in 2015 synthesized a self‐injectable chitosan‐based hydrogels that gelatinized slowly at room temperature but rapidly at body temperature (37°C). The hydrogels stimulated 38% neural regeneration in the zebrafish embryo model.\n58\n Yao and colleagues, by combining chitosan, beta‐glycerophosphate, hyaluronic acid and hydroxy cellulose developed a thermal hydrogel carrying human umbilical cord neural stem cells. This biocompatibility composite thermal hydrogel with optimum gelation rate secretes BDNF resulting in neuronal proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis process, facilitating survival and recovery in rat models.\n59",
        "Fibrin, a natural enzyme‐degrading protein synthesized by simply mixing thrombin with fibrinogen and involved in blood and lymph coagulation is highly biocompatible and biodegradable in nature.\n60\n Its ability to bind many proteins, cells, and ECMs makes it a flexible hydrogel.\n79\n Additionally, the ratio of fibrinogen and thrombin can be adjusted to match the mechanical properties of fibrin hydrogels with those of human spinal cord tissues. Furthermore, as per study, during in vivo degradation or polymerization, the released by‐products from the hydrogel also contribute to damage repair.\n79",
        "By the year 1998, the US‐FDA had approved fibrin tissue sealant for use in intraoperative hemostasis and wound healing.\n80\n By introducing ultrasound into a silk fibroin solution, some researchers developed a silk hydrogel based on fibrin. By controlling the time and intensity of ultrasound, brain compatibility was achieved. Experimental mice injected with this silk‐based fibrin hydrogel showed cell death and inflammation in the implanted area without any sensory, motor, or cognitive deficits, indicating its biosafety in the brain.\n81\n Further study has demonstrated that fibrin‐based biological scaffolds are capable of not only providing a sustaining environment for transplanted cells after a brain injury but also exerting neuronal antiapoptosis.\n82\n When used homologously, this hydrogel has been found to have complete biocompatibility based on current research. Neuronal differentiation could be enhanced by precisely controlling its mechanical properties by adjusting the ratio of fibrinogen to thrombin or by adding some other stable hydrogels.\n83\n In light of these characteristics, fibrin is an interesting tissue engineering candidate, however, fibrin hydrogel systems have been poorly utilized in brain research to date.",
        "Collagen, a natural hydrogel synthesized by hydrolysis of gelatin, has diverse applications in medical science such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, bone reconstruction, dressing of wounds and various cell encapsulation systems. Depending upon applicability, it can be shaped from films and shields to nanoparticles, sponges and gels.\n84\n, \n85\n While there are 29 types of collagen, only type I and type IV collagen are abundant and most widely used.\n86\n Type IV collagen plays an important role in the formation of neuromuscular junctions and the basement membrane of the BBB within the nervous system. While type I collagen contributes to development of neurons, formation of dura mater, pia mater as well as growth of axons.\n87\n It has also gained immense attention for CNS repair owing to its biodegradability, biocompatibility, versatility, and nontoxicity and is considered a potential candidate for regeneration of brain tissues.\n85",
        "Based on applicability, collagen can be shaped to micro or nanospheres or injectable scaffolds to release drugs locally to protect neurons in neurodegenerative conditions like PD or AD and for encapsulating stem and genetically modified cells for its safer delivery. Further, collagen has immense application as filling agents in filling the voids caused by injuries where it provides structural support and a suitable microenvironment for the growth of axons.\n88\n Literature provides sufficient information regarding use of collagen hydrogels in brain tissue regeneration therapy. In the study by Guan and his colleagues, human bone marrow‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in combination with collagen hydrogel were injected into the injury site of experimental rats.\n89\n Results showed that the combination of collagen hydrogel with hMSCs is therapeutically more promising as compared to the hMSCs alone. In the presence of collagen hydrogels, the proliferation of hMSCs to specific organs was enhanced while inhibiting proliferation to nonspecific organs and supporting cell differentiation and growth. This resulted in enhanced brain metabolism and restoration of its function. In another study, rat NSCs were injected in healthy rats by suspending in collagen hydrogel solution.\n90\n The stem cells displayed excellent viability in the hydrogel and could be reabsorbed after 15 days which suggests biodegradability of the collagen hydrogel.",
        "Hoban et al. used collagen (type I) as vectors to deliver glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factors (GDNF) to the brain via transgenic bone marine‐derived MSCs for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. As a result of the study, hydrogel reduced both astrocyte recruitment and responses of microglial cells without affecting cell survival or GDNF secretion.\n91\n These studies suggest that injectable collagen hydrogels have great potentials as a treatment for TBI and other nerve injury repair strategies.

        "These hydrogels are artificially synthesized in a laboratory using chemical processes. They are composed of synthetic polymers or materials that are not naturally occurring, however it present opportunities for precise customization of properties. While modifications may be needed for optimal biocompatibility, their versatility in mechanical attributes is particularly advantageous.\n95\n, \n96\n, \n97\n These hydrogels predominantly comprise polyacrylamide (PAM) and PEG as their base materials. In contrast to naturally occurring hydrogels, these hydrogels exhibit comparatively inferior physical characteristics and are more prone to inducing inflammatory responses following in vivo administration.\n95\n They hold promise in mitigating debilitating neurological conditions through multifaceted mechanisms. These hydrogels, when injected into the affected area, can provide a supportive three‐dimensional matrix that promotes cell survival and tissue regeneration.\n95\n Moreover, their tunable properties enable controlled release of therapeutic agents, such as neurotrophic factors or drugs, facilitating localized treatment and fostering neural recovery.\n95\n, \n97\n In an in vivo investigation conducted by Tamariz et al.,\n96\n PEG‐Si, a thixotropic hydrogel containing irradiation silica nanoparticles, was intracranially administered into the striatum of rats, while a sterile saline solution was injected into the corresponding cerebral hemisphere as a control. After a duration of 30 days, notable substantiation and astrocolloid reactions were observed specifically in the hemisphere where the polymer hydrogel was introduced. In 2008, Bjugstad et al.,\n97\n conducted a study involving the implantation of PEG‐based hydrogels into the striatum and frontal cortex regions of primates. The hydrogel formation involved the photocrosslinking of a PLA‐B‐PEG‐B‐PLA triblock polymer using a methacrylate group. In one hemisphere of the grivet brain, the hydrogels were injected, while the contralateral hemisphere received a needle injection without the hydrogels, serving as the sham‐implantation group. A third grivet received bilateral injections of PEG‐GDNF. The complete degradation of all hydrogels was observed after a 4‐month period. A PEG hydrogel concentration of 13% w/v induced minimal infiltration of astrocytes and microglia, which was comparable to that observed in the sham‐implantation group. Conversely, a marginal increment in the glial response was observed when utilizing 20% w/v PEG hydrogels incorporated with GDNF, thereby suggesting that PEG‐based hydrogels persist in their capacity as a viable drug delivery system with promising prospects, even subsequent to modifications.\n97",
        "Self‐assembled hydrogels represent a three‐dimensional framework composed of polymeric substances that undergo self‐assembly through either physical or chemical crosslinking mechanisms. They may incorporate both natural and synthetic components depending on the design. These materials exhibit exceptional attributes such as remarkable biocompatibility, biodegradability, and responsiveness to physiological stimuli, thereby rendering them highly suitable for applications in tissue culture, drug delivery systems, and the fabrication of implanted sensors for human use. Furthermore, the versatile bonding interactions between the polymeric chains and water molecules, along with their capacity for chelating metal ions, expand their potential applications in fields such as photovoltaics and optics.\n98\n The biocompatibility of self‐assembled hydrogels is attributed to some extent to their composition, which generally includes biological or bio‐inspired molecules such as proteins, peptides, amino acids, carbohydrates, therapeutic agents, and oligonucleotides.\n99\n Such hydrogels are generated through the spontaneous self‐assembly of monomeric constituents, leading to the formation of polymer‐like fibrils through noncovalent interactions. The entanglement of these fibrils further results in the formation of an extensive network, inducing gelation of the surrounding aqueous solvent. Self‐assembled hydrogels have demonstrated distinct advantages over covalently bonded hydrogels, making them desirable for applications in the biomedical domain.\n99\n The versatility and biomimetic nature of self‐assembling peptides (SAPs) render them an optimal choice for addressing the intricate and sensitive environment associated with neural tissue damage. In addition to the finely tailored properties of these hydrogels, which strive to emulate healthy physiological tissue, the use of a minimally invasive delivery approach becomes crucial to mitigate off‐target effects and complications arising from surgical interventions. SAPs, belonging to the class of injectable hydrogels, are characterized by short, repetitive amino acid units and modified polar and nonpolar residues, enabling them to form a double‐β‐sheet structure upon dissolution in water.\n100\n This structural arrangement facilitates sol‐gel transition without the need for toxic cross‐linking agents or chemical additives, thereby exhibiting inherent biocompatibility. SAPs provide a favorable combination of in situ polymerization, adaptability for biofunctionalization, the capability to finely adjust physicochemical characteristics, and remarkable compatibility with living cells.\n101\n Guo et al. conducted an experiment wherein an ionic complementary hydrogel, namely RADA16, was implanted into the lesion cavities of rats with surgically induced TBI. The objective was to evaluate its potential for reconstructing the damaged cortex. Remarkably, RADA16 exhibited successful integration with the host tissue and resulted in a significant reduction in the size of the lesion cavity after a six‐week period. Furthermore, researchers observed a notable decrease in pathological glial hyperplasia and an attenuated inflammatory response.\n102\n In another study, SAP hydrogels demonstrated the capability to deliver exogenous stem cells into the brain. To achieve this, researchers modified RADA16 by attaching an adhesion motif called IKVAV, derived from laminin, and encapsulated NSCs within the modified hydrogels. Subsequently, this combination was transplanted into rats with neocortical damage caused by a perforated biopsy. After 6 weeks, the encapsulated NSCs proliferated and differentiated into neurons, as evidenced by an increase in the expression of mature neuronal markers such as β‐tubulin and microtubule‐associated protein 2 (MAP2), compared to the use of cell therapy alone. Moreover, there was an observed increase in the levels of Synapsin‐1, a potential marker of synaptic formation.\n103\n Additionally, several experiments have demonstrated the ability of SAPs to transport drugs, biological agents, and other therapeutic substances into the damaged brain cavity, thereby improving treatment efficacy while maintaining favorable biocompatibility.\n104\n, \n105",
        "Injectable hydrogels intended for CNS regeneration must exhibit biocompatibility, non‐immunogenicity, and a lack of detrimental effects on human cells and tissues.\n106\n Furthermore, these hydrogels should promote axonal growth and elongation while gradually degrading over time, eliminating the need for additional surgical procedures to remove the scaffold.\n107\n, \n108\n The mechanical characteristics, encompassing stiffness and surface topography of the scaffolds, are pivotal factors in their biomaterial design. Studies have revealed that even small variations in mechanical and topographical features can profoundly influence cell fate, attachment, polarity, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival.\n109\n In the context of neural tissue engineering, scaffolds must be able to withstand the stresses exerted by the surrounding tissues.\n108\n Thus, before injection, the hydrogels should possess a lower elastic modulus than their storage modulus, while after injection, they should transit to a state where the storage modulus exceeds the elastic modulus, resulting in the formation of a soft and cohesive solid that can withstand the pressure from the surrounding tissues.\n110",
        "The swelling ratio and degradation rate of biomaterials are influenced by various factors, including the type of polymer, chemical and mechanical properties of the biomaterial, and the presence of enzymes at the injury site. For effective CNS regeneration, hydrogels should degrade slowly and exhibit minimal swelling. The degradation rate of the biomaterial should strike a balance between early degradation, which could impact glial scarring, cause additional inflammation, and inhibit axon elongation, and late degradation, which could facilitate new tissue generation and prevent long‐distance axonal regeneration.\n110\n Excessive hydrogel degradation before neural regeneration can result in swelling and a loss of mechanical injury.\n111\n, \n112\n Additionally, the porosity of scaffolds, as well as the diameter and interconnectivity of pores, are crucial for proper nutrient and biological molecular diffusion, waste elimination, cell attachment, and tissue growth.\n113\n High swelling ratios can lead to hydrogel deformation, occlusion of the defect, and inhibition of neurite development.\n114\n The incorporation of hydrophilic or electrostatically charged moieties in hydrogels can increase swelling, but it may also enhance network permeability and significantly affect hydrogel biomechanics. In the context of subdural injection of hydrogels after spinal cord or traumatic brain injuries, maximal swelling can aid in the removal of excess fluid from the parenchyma, thus preventing further inquiry.\n115\n It is worth noting that pre‐swelling of micro‐particle‐based hydrogels\n116\n and shape‐memory hydrogels before in vivo delivery may cause tissue damage similar to in situ swelling pressures. Moreover, increasing macromere content or crosslinking density can reduce water uptake of hydrogels, but this may compromise mechanical strength and permeability, leading to potential issues and adverse consequences.\n117",
        "Another critical characteristic of injectable hydrogels is their solidification conditions, which should minimize tissue and cell damage, allowing solidification to occur under mild circumstances.\n117\n The initial velocity of the hydrogel and various environmental parameters, including crosslinker, pH, light, and temperature that influence solidification are of great importance. These parameters must be biocompatible and enable the hydrogel to undergo gelation within seconds to minutes of injection.\n117\n The gelation time of injectable hydrogels is a crucial consideration. Adequate gelation time is essential to mitigate the risk of injection needle occlusion and facilitate the interaction between the spared spinal cord tissue and the hydrogel solution before gelation. Further research is warranted to establish the optimal gelation times for diverse types of injectable hydrogels.\n118",
        "Designing biomaterials for brain repair presents a range of challenges, as elucidated in recent scientific literature. Among these challenges, achieving optimal bioavailability and nonimmunogenicity of the employed biomaterials stands out prominently. Studies have emphasized the importance of selecting materials that do not elicit harmful immune response and are well‐tolerated by brain tissue.\n119\n, \n120",
        "Another challenge is promoting appropriate cellular interactions and tissue integration. Recent research has focused on developing biomaterials that can stimulate axonal growth, guide neuronal migration, and support the formation of functional neural networks.\n121\n, \n122\n Furthermore, achieving controlled degradation rates and avoiding excessive swelling is crucial for biomaterials intended for brain repair. Recent studies have investigated strategies to optimize the degradation kinetics of biomaterials to match the regenerative timeline of brain tissue and prevent adverse reactions such as glial scarring.\n123\n, \n124",
        "In addition, the mechanical properties of biomaterials play a crucial role in their design.

The failure to achieve successful drug treatments for neurological diseases has led to the emergence of alternative approaches, like cell‐based therapies, for brain healing and repair. The advent of biomaterials has profoundly revolutionized the potential of brain cell repair. The ability to design biomaterials‐based devices for localized delivery of cells and biomolecules in a minimally invasive manner has opened up intriguing possibilities for targeting neuroprotection and neuroregeneration, overcoming the limitations associated with conventional drug delivery methods for brain therapeutics. It is evident that we are entering an era of specialized and rational biomaterial design to address CNS injuries, with exhaustive investigations conducted for each specific condition to optimize the development of biomaterial‐based therapies. Traditional implanted hydrogels are no longer adequate for meeting the requirements of contemporary treatments. Injectable hydrogels have the ability to undergo sol–gel transition in vitro and in vivo. Precise injection of hydrogels, along with the necessary cells and drugs, into the lesion site using a fine needle, followed by in vivo gelation at an appropriate rate within the lesion cavity, holds the potential to minimize the cavity, promote nerve tissue regeneration, and reduce inflammation. However, the unstable and imprecise introduction of hydrogels into the body poses risks due to the demanding technical requirements associated with brain injection and the lack of reported procedures. Moreover, the understanding of the mechanism underlying nerve tissue growth stimulation remains insufficient. Therefore, in addition to encouraging continued research on the structure and properties of hydrogels, further investigations should prioritize elucidating the mechanism governing tissue responses to enhance functional recovery after hydrogel implantation. Ongoing research endeavors provide hope for the design of highly efficient injectable hydrogels for repairing brain damage.",

        "Regenerative medicine, the most recent and emerging branch of medical science, deals with functional restoration of specific tissue and/or organ of the patients suffering with severe injuries or chronic disease conditions, in the state where bodies own regenerative responses do not suffice [1]. In the present scenario donated tissues and organs cannot meet the transplantation demands of aged and diseased populations that have driven the thrust for search for the alternatives. Stem cells are endorsed with indefinite cell division potential, can transdifferentiate into other types of cells, and have emerged as frontline regenerative medicine source in recent time, for reparation of tissues and organs anomalies occurring due to congenital defects, disease, and age associated effects [1]. Stem cells pave foundation for all tissue and organ system of the body and mediates diverse role in disease progression, development, and tissue repair processes in host. On the basis of transdifferentiation potential, stem cells are of four types, that is, (1) unipotent, (2) multipotent, (3) pluripotent, and (4) totipotent [2]. Zygote, the only totipotent stem cell in human body, can give rise to whole organism through the process of transdifferentiation, while cells from inner cells mass (ICM) of embryo are pluripotent in their nature and can differentiate into cells representing three germ layers but do not differentiate into cells of extraembryonic tissue [2]. Stemness and transdifferentiation potential of the embryonic, extraembryonic, fetal, or adult stem cells depend on functional status of pluripotency factors like OCT4, cMYC, KLF44, NANOG, SOX2, and so forth [3–5]. Ectopic expression or functional restoration of endogenous pluripotency factors epigenetically transforms terminally differentiated cells into ESCs-like cells [3], known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [3, 4]. On the basis of regenerative applications, stem cells can be categorized as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), tissue specific progenitor stem cells (TSPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), umbilical cord stem cells (UCSCs), bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), and iPSCs (Figure 1; Table 1). The transplantation of stem cells can be autologous, allogenic, and syngeneic for induction of tissue regeneration and immunolysis of pathogen or malignant cells. For avoiding the consequences of host-versus-graft rejections, tissue typing of human leucocyte antigens (HLA) for tissue and organ transplant as well as use of immune suppressant is recommended [6]. Stem cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) receptor in low and secret chemokine that recruitment of endothelial and immune cells is enabling tissue tolerance at graft site [6]. The current stem cell regenerative medicine approaches are founded onto tissue engineering technologies that combine the principles of cell transplantation, material science, and microengineering for development of organoid; those can be used for physiological restoration of damaged tissue and organs. The tissue engineering technology generates nascent tissue on biodegradable 3D-scaffolds [7, 8]. The ideal scaffolds support cell adhesion and ingrowths, mimic mechanics of target tissue, support angiogenesis and neovascularisation for appropriate tissue perfusion, and, being nonimmunogenic to host, do not require systemic immune suppressant [9]. Stem cells number in tissue transplant impacts upon regenerative outcome [10]; in that case prior ex vivo expansion of transplantable stem cells is required [11]. For successful regenerative outcomes, transplanted stem cells must survive, proliferate, and differentiate in site specific manner and integrate into host circulatory system [12]. This review provides framework of most recent (Table 1; Figures 1\n\n\n\n\n\n–8) advancement in transplantation and tissue engineering technologies of ESCs, TSPSCs, MSCs, UCSCs, BMSCs, and iPSCs in regenerative medicine. Additionally, this review also discusses stem cells as the tool of regenerative applications in wildlife conservation.",
        "For the first time in 1998, Thomson isolated human ESCs (hESCs) [13]. ESCs are pluripotent in their nature and can give rise to more than 200 types of cells and promises for the treatment of any kinds of disease [13]. The pluripotency fate of ESCs is governed by functional dynamics of transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and so forth, which are termed as pluripotency factors. The two alleles of the OCT4 are held apart in pluripotency state in ESCs; phase through homologues pairing during embryogenesis and transdifferentiation processes [14] has been considered as critical regulatory switch for lineage commitment of ESCs. The diverse lineage commitment potential represents ESCs as ideal model for regenerative therapeutics of disease and tissue anomalies. This section of review on ESCs discusses transplantation and transdifferentiation of ESCs into retinal ganglion, hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, pancreatic progenitors, chondrocytes, cones, egg sperm, and pacemaker cells (Figure 2; Table 1). Infection, cancer treatment, and accidents can cause spinal cord injuries (SCIs). The transplantation of hESCs to paraplegic or quadriplegic SCI patients improves body control, balance, sensation, and limbal movements [15], where transplanted stem cells do homing to injury sites. By birth, humans have fixed numbers of cone cells; degeneration of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of macula in central retina causes age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). The genomic incorporation of COCO gene (expressed during embryogenesis) in the developing embryo leads lineage commitment of ESCs into cone cells, through suppression of TGFβ, BMP, and Wnt signalling pathways. Transplantation of these cone cells to eye recovers individual from ARMD phenomenon, where transplanted cone cells migrate and form sheet-like structure in host retina [16]. However, establishment of missing neuronal connection of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), cones, and PRE is the most challenging aspect of ARMD therapeutics. Recently, Donald Z Jacks group at John Hopkins University School of Medicine has generated RGCs from CRISPER-Cas9-m-Cherry reporter ESCs [17]. During ESCs transdifferentiation process, CRIPER-Cas9 directs the knock-in of m-Cherry reporter into 3′UTR of BRN3B gene, which is specifically expressed in RGCs and can be used for purification of generated RGCs from other cells [17]. Furthermore, incorporation of forskolin in transdifferentiation regime boosts generation of RGCs. Coaxing of these RGCs into biomaterial scaffolds directs axonal differentiation of RGCs. Further modification in RGCs generation regime and composition of biomaterial scaffolds might enable restoration of vision for ARMD and glaucoma patients [17]. Globally, especially in India, cardiovascular problems are a more common cause of human death, where biomedical therapeutics require immediate restoration of heart functions for the very survival of the patient. Regeneration of cardiac tissue can be achieved by transplantation of cardiomyocytes, ESCs-derived cardiovascular progenitors, and bone marrow derived mononuclear cells (BMDMNCs); however healing by cardiomyocytes and progenitor cells is superior to BMDMNCs but mature cardiomyocytes have higher tissue healing potential, suppress heart arrhythmias, couple electromagnetically into hearts functions, and provide mechanical and electrical repair without any associated tumorigenic effects [18, 19]. Like CM differentiation, ESCs derived liver stem cells can be transformed into Cytp450-hepatocytes, mediating chemical modification and catabolism of toxic xenobiotic drugs [20]. Even today, availability and variability of functional hepatocytes are a major a challenge for testing drug toxicity [20]. Stimulation of ESCs and ex vivo VitK12 and lithocholic acid (a by-product of intestinal flora regulating drug metabolism during infancy) activates pregnane X receptor (PXR), CYP3A4, and CYP2C9, which leads to differentiation of ESCs into hepatocytes; those are functionally similar to primary hepatocytes, for their ability to produce albumin and apolipoprotein B100 [20]. These hepatocytes are excellent source for the endpoint screening of drugs for accurate prediction of clinical outcomes [20]. Generation of hepatic cells from ESCs can be achieved in multiple ways, as serum-free differentiation [21], chemical approaches [20, 22], and genetic transformation [23, 24]. These ESCs-derived hepatocytes are long lasting source for treatment of liver injuries and high throughput screening of drugs [20, 23, 24]. Transplantation of the inert biomaterial encapsulated hESCs-derived pancreatic progenitors (CD24+, CD49+, and CD133+) differentiates into β-cells, minimizing high fat diet induced glycemic and obesity effects in mice [25] (Table 1). Addition of antidiabetic drugs into transdifferentiation regime can boost ESCs conservation into β-cells [25], which theoretically can cure T2DM permanently [25]. ESCs can be differentiated directly into insulin secreting β-cells (marked with GLUT2, INS1, GCK, and PDX1) which can be achieved through PDX1 mediated epigenetic reprogramming [26]. Globally, osteoarthritis affects millions of people and occurs when cartilage at joints wears away, causing stiffness of the joints. The available therapeutics for arthritis relieve symptoms but do not initiate reverse generation of cartilage. For young individuals and athletes replacement of joints is not feasible like old populations; in that case transplantation of stem cells represents an alternative for healing cartilage injuries [27]. Chondrocytes, the cartilage forming cells derived from hESC, embedded in fibrin gel effectively heal defective cartilage within 12 weeks, when transplanted to focal cartilage defects of knee joints in mice without any negative effect [27]. Transplanted chondrocytes form cell aggregates, positive for SOX9 and collagen II, and defined chondrocytes are active for more than 12 wks at transplantation site, advocating clinical suitability of chondrocytes for treatment of cartilage lesions [27]. The integrity of ESCs to integrate and differentiate into electrophysiologically active cells provides a means for natural regulation of heart rhythm as biological pacemaker. Coaxing of ESCs into inert biomaterial as well as propagation in defined culture conditions leads to transdifferentiation of ESCs to become sinoatrial node (SAN) pacemaker cells (PCs) [28]. Genomic incorporation TBox3 into ESCs ex vivo leads to generation of PCs-like cells; those express activated leukocyte cells adhesion molecules (ALCAM) and exhibit similarity to PCs for gene expression and immune functions [28]. Transplantation of PCs can restore pacemaker functions of the ailing heart [28]. In summary, ESCs can be transdifferentiated into any kinds of cells representing three germ layers of the body, being most promising source of regenerative medicine for tissue regeneration and disease therapy (Table 1). Ethical concerns limit the applications of ESCs, where set guidelines need to be followed; in that case TSPSCs, MSCs, UCSCs, BMSCs, and iPSCs can be explored as alternatives.",
        "TSPSCs maintain tissue homeostasis through continuous cell division, but, unlike ESCs, TSPSCs retain stem cells plasticity and differentiation in tissue specific manner, giving rise to few types of cells (Table 1). The number of TSPSCs population to total cells population is too low; in that case their harvesting as well as in vitro manipulation is really a tricky task [29], to explore them for therapeutic scale. Human body has foundation from various types of TSPSCs; discussing the therapeutic application for all types is not feasible. This section of review discusses therapeutic application of pancreatic progenitor cells (PPCs), dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), inner ear stem cells (IESCs), intestinal progenitor cells (IPCs), limbal progenitor stem cells (LPSCs), epithelial progenitor stem cells (EPSCs), mesoangioblasts (MABs), spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), the skin derived precursors (SKPs), and adipose derived stem cells (AdSCs) (Figure 3; Table 1). During embryogenesis PPCs give rise to insulin-producing β-cells. The differentiation of PPCs to become β-cells is negatively regulated by insulin [30]. PPCs require active FGF and Notch signalling; growing more rapidly in community than in single cell populations advocates the functional importance of niche effect in self-renewal and transdifferentiation processes. In 3D-scaffold culture system, mice embryo derived PPCs grow into hollow organoid spheres; those finally differentiate into insulin-producing β-cell clusters [29]. The DSPSCs, responsible for maintenance of teeth health status, can be sourced from apical papilla, deciduous teeth, dental follicle, and periodontal ligaments, have emerged as regenerative medicine candidate, and might be explored for treatment of various kinds of disease including restoration neurogenic functions in teeth [31, 32]. Expansion of DSPSCs in chemically defined neuronal culture medium transforms them into a mixed population of cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutaminergic neurons; those are known to respond towards acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamine stimulations in vivo. These transformed neuronal cells express nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), βIII-tubulin, and voltage gated L-type Ca2+ channels [32]. However, absence of Na+ and K+ channels does not support spontaneous action potential generation, necessary for response generation against environmental stimulus. All together, these primordial neuronal stem cells have possible therapeutic potential for treatment of neurodental problems [32]. Sometimes, brain tumor chemotherapy can cause neurodegeneration mediated cognitive impairment, a condition known as chemobrain [33]. The intrahippocampal transplantation of human derived neuronal stem cells to cyclophosphamide behavioural decremented mice restores cognitive functions in a month time. Here the transplanted stem cells differentiate into neuronal and astroglial lineage, reduce neuroinflammation, and restore microglial functions [33]. Furthermore, transplantation of stem cells, followed by chemotherapy, directs pyramidal and granule-cell neurons of the gyrus and CA1 subfields of hippocampus which leads to reduction in spine and dendritic cell density in the brain. These findings suggest that transplantation of stem cells to cranium restores cognitive functions of the chemobrain [33]. The hair cells of the auditory system produced during development are not postmitotic; loss of hair cells cannot be replaced by inner ear stem cells, due to active state of the Notch signalling [34]. Stimulation of inner ear progenitors with ϒ-secretase inhibitor (LY411575) abrogates Notch signalling through activation of transcription factor atonal homologue 1 (Atoh1) and directs transdifferentiation of progenitors into cochlear hair cells [34]. Transplantation of in vitro generated hair cells restores acoustic functions in mice, which can be the potential regenerative medicine candidates for the treatment of deafness [34]. Generation of the hair cells also can be achieved through overexpression of β-catenin and Atoh1 in Lrg5+ cells in vivo [35]. Similar to ear progenitors, intestine of the digestive tract also has its own tissue specific progenitor stem cells, mediating regeneration of the intestinal tissue [34, 36]. Dysregulation of the common stem cells signalling pathways, Notch/BMP/TGF-β/Wnt, in the intestinal tissue leads to disease. Information on these signalling pathways [37] is critically important in designing therapeutics. Coaxing of the intestinal tissue specific progenitors with immune cells (macrophages), connective tissue cells (myofibroblasts), and probiotic bacteria into 3D-scaffolds of inert biomaterial, crafting biological environment, is suitable for differentiation of progenitors to occupy the crypt-villi structures into these scaffolds [36]. Omental implementation of these crypt-villi structures to dogs enhances intestinal mucosa through regeneration of goblet cells containing intestinal tissue [36]. These intestinal scaffolds are close approach for generation of implantable intestinal tissue, divested by infection, trauma, cancer, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and so forth [36]. In vitro culture conditions cause differentiation of intestinal stem cells to become other types of cells, whereas incorporation of valproic acid and CHIR-99021 in culture conditions avoids differentiation of intestinal stem cells, enabling generation of indefinite pool of stem cells to be used for regenerative applications [38]. The limbal stem cells of the basal limbal epithelium, marked with ABCB5, are essential for regeneration and maintenance of corneal tissue [39]. Functional status of ABCB5 is critical for survival and functional integrity of limbal stem cells, protecting them from apoptotic cell death [39]. Limbal stem cells deficiency leads to replacement of corneal epithelium with visually dead conjunctival tissue, which can be contributed by burns, inflammation, and genetic factors [40]. Transplanted human cornea stem cells to mice regrown into fully functional human cornea, possibly supported by blood eye barrier phenomena, can be used for treatment of eye diseases, where regeneration of corneal tissue is critically required for vision restoration [39]. Muscle degenerative disease like duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can cause extensive thrashing of muscle tissue, where tissue engineering technology can be deployed for functional restoration of tissue through regeneration [41]. Encapsulation of mouse or human derived MABs (engineered to express placental derived growth factor (PDGF)) into polyethylene glycol (PEG) fibrinogen hydrogel and their transplantation beneath the skin at ablated tibialis anterior form artificial muscles, which are functionally similar to those of normal tibialis anterior muscles [41]. The PDGF attracts various cell types of vasculogenic and neurogenic potential to the site of transplantation, supporting transdifferentiation of mesoangioblasts to become muscle fibrils [41]. The therapeutic application of MABs in skeletal muscle regeneration and other therapeutic outcomes has been reviewed by others [42]. One of the most important tissue specific stem cells, the male germline stem cells or spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), produces spermatogenic lineage through mesenchymal and epithets cells [43] which itself creates niche effect on other cells. In vivo transplantation of SSCs with prostate, skin, and uterine mesenchyme leads to differentiation of these cells to become epithelia of the tissue of origin [43]. These newly formed tissues exhibit all physical and physiological characteristics of prostate and skin and the physical characteristics of prostate, skin, and uterus, express tissue specific markers, and suggest that factors secreted from SSCs lead to lineage conservation which defines the importance of niche effect in regenerative medicine [43]. According to an estimate, more than 100 million people are suffering from the condition of diabetic retinopathy, a progressive dropout of vascularisation in retina that leads to loss of vision [44]. The intravitreal injection of adipose derived stem cells (AdSCs) to the eye restores microvascular capillary bed in mice. The AdSCs from healthy donor produce higher amounts of vasoprotective factors compared to glycemic mice, enabling superior vascularisation [44]. However use of AdSCs for disease therapeutics needs further standardization for cell counts in dose of transplant and monitoring of therapeutic outcomes at population scale [44]. Apart from AdSCs, other kinds of stem cells also have therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine for treatment of eye defects, which has been reviewed by others [45]. Fallopian tubes, connecting ovaries to uterus, are the sites where fertilization of the egg takes place. Infection in fallopian tubes can lead to inflammation, tissue scarring, and closure of the fallopian tube which often leads to infertility and ectopic pregnancies. Fallopian is also the site where onset of ovarian cancer takes place. The studies on origin and etiology of ovarian cancer are restricted due to lack of technical advancement for culture of epithelial cells. The in vitro 3D organoid culture of clinically obtained fallopian tube epithelial cells retains their tissue specificity, keeps cells alive, which differentiate into typical ciliated and secretory cells of fallopian tube, and advocates that ectopic examination of fallopian tube in organoid culture settings might be the ideal approach for screening of cancer [46]. The sustained growth and differentiation of fallopian TSPSCs into fallopian tube organoid depend both on the active state of the Wnt and on paracrine Notch signalling [46]. Similar to fallopian tube stem cells, subcutaneous visceral tissue specific cardiac adipose (CA) derived stem cells (AdSCs) have the potential of differentiation into cardiovascular tissue [47]. Systemic infusion of CA-AdSCs into ischemic myocardium of mice regenerates heart tissue and improves cardiac function through differentiation to endothelial cells, vascular smooth cells, and cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth cells. The differentiation and heart regeneration potential of CA-AdSCs are higher than AdSCs [48], representing CA-AdSCs as potent regenerative medicine candidates for myocardial ischemic therapy [47]. The skin derived precursors (SKPs), the progenitors of dermal papilla/hair/hair sheath, give rise to multiple tissues of mesodermal and/or ectodermal origin such as neurons, Schwann cells, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). VSMCs mediate wound healing and angiogenesis process can be derived from human foreskin progenitor SKPs, suggesting that SKPs derived VSMCs are potential regenerative medicine candidates for wound healing and vasculature injuries treatments [49]. In summary, TSPSCs are potentiated with tissue regeneration, where advancement in organoid culture (Figure 3; Table 1) technologies defines the importance of niche effect in tissue regeneration and therapeutic outcomes of ex vivo expanded stem cells.",
        "MSCs, the multilineage stem cells, differentiate only to tissue of mesodermal origin, which includes tendons, bone, cartilage, ligaments, muscles, and neurons [50]. MSCs are the cells which express combination of markers: CD73+, CD90+, CD105+, CD11b−, CD14−, CD19−, CD34−, CD45−, CD79a−, and HLA-DR, reviewed elsewhere [50]. The application of MSCs in regenerative medicine can be generalized from ongoing clinical trials, phasing through different state of completions, reviewed elsewhere [90]. This section of review outlines the most recent representative applications of MSCs (Figure 4; Table 1). The anatomical and physiological characteristics of both donor and receiver have equal impact on therapeutic outcomes. The bone marrow derived MSCs (BMDMSCs) from baboon are morphologically and phenotypically similar to those of bladder stem cells and can be used in regeneration of bladder tissue. The BMDMSCs (CD105+, CD73+, CD34−, and CD45−), expressing GFP reporter, coaxed with small intestinal submucosa (SIS) scaffolds, augment healing of degenerated bladder tissue within 10 wks of the transplantation [51]. The combinatorial CD characterized MACs are functionally active at transplantation site, which suggests that CD characterization of donor MSCs yields superior regenerative outcomes [51]. MSCs also have potential to regenerate liver tissue and treat liver cirrhosis, reviewed elsewhere [91]. The regenerative medicinal application of MSCs utilizes cells in two formats as direct transplantation or first transdifferentiation and then transplantation; ex vivo transdifferentiation of MSCs deploys retroviral delivery system that can cause oncogenic effect on cells. Nonviral, NanoScript technology, comprising utility of transcription factors (TFs) functionalized gold nanoparticles, can target specific regulatory site in the genome effectively and direct differentiation of MSCs into another cell fate, depending on regime of TFs. For example, myogenic regulatory factor containing NanoScript-MRF differentiates the adipose tissue derived MSCs into muscle cells [92]. The multipotency characteristics represent MSCs as promising candidate for obtaining stable tissue constructs through coaxed 3D organoid culture; however heterogeneous distribution of MSCs slows down cell proliferation, rendering therapeutic applications of MSCs. Adopting two-step culture system for MSCs can yield homogeneous distribution of MSCs in biomaterial scaffolds. For example, fetal-MSCs coaxed in biomaterial when cultured first in rotating bioreactor followed with static culture lead to homogeneous distribution of MSCs in ECM components [7]. Occurrence of dental carries, periodontal disease, and tooth injury can impact individual's health, where bioengineering of teeth can be the alternative option. Coaxing of epithelial-MSCs with dental stem cells into synthetic polymer gives rise to mature teeth unit, which consisted of mature teeth and oral tissue, offering multiple regenerative therapeutics, reviewed elsewhere [52]. Like the tooth decay, both human and animals are prone to orthopedic injuries, affecting bones, joint, tendon, muscles, cartilage, and so forth. Although natural healing potential of bone is sufficient to heal the common injuries, severe trauma and tumor-recession can abrogate germinal potential of bone-forming stem cells. In vitro chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic potential of MSCs advocates therapeutic applications of MSCs in orthopedic injuries [53]. Seeding of MSCs, coaxed into biomaterial scaffolds, at defective bone tissue, regenerates defective bone tissues, within four wks of transplantation; by the end of 32 wks newly formed tissues integrate into old bone [54]. Osteoblasts, the bone-forming cells, have lesser actin cytoskeleton compared to adipocytes and MSCs. Treatment of MSCs with cytochalasin-D causes rapid transportation of G-actin, leading to osteogenic transformation of MSCs. Furthermore, injection of cytochalasin-D to mice tibia also promotes bone formation within a wk time frame [55]. The bone formation processes in mice, dog, and human are fundamentally similar, so outcomes of research on mice and dogs can be directional for regenerative application to human. Injection of MSCs to femur head of Legg-Calve-Perthes suffering dog heals the bone very fast and reduces the injury associated pain [55]. Degeneration of skeletal muscle and muscle cramps are very common to sledge dogs, animals, and individuals involved in adventurous athletics activities. Direct injection of adipose tissue derived MSCs to tear-site of semitendinosus muscle in dogs heals injuries much faster than traditional therapies [56]. Damage effect treatment for heart muscle regeneration is much more complex than regeneration of skeletal muscles, which needs high grade fine-tuned coordination of neurons with muscles. Coaxing of MSCs into alginate gel increases cell retention time that leads to releasing of tissue repairing factors in controlled manner. Transplantation of alginate encapsulated cells to mice heart reduces scar size and increases vascularisation, which leads to restoration of heart functions. Furthermore, transplanted MSCs face host inhospitable inflammatory immune responses and other mechanical forces at transplantation site, where encapsulation of cells keeps them away from all sorts of mechanical forces and enables sensing of host tissue microenvironment, and respond accordingly [57]. Ageing, disease, and medicine consumption can cause hair loss, known as alopecia. Although alopecia has no life threatening effects, emotional catchments can lead to psychological disturbance. The available treatments for alopecia include hair transplantation and use of drugs, where drugs are expensive to afford and generation of new hair follicle is challenging. Dermal papillary cells (DPCs), the specialized MSCs localized in hair follicle, are responsible for morphogenesis of hair follicle and hair cycling. The layer-by-layer coating of DPCs, called GAG coating, consists of coating of geletin as outer layer, middle layer of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) loaded alginate, and innermost layer of geletin. GAG coating creates tissue microenvironment for DPCs that can sustain immunological and mechanical obstacles, supporting generation of hair follicle. Transplantation of GAG-coated DPCs leads to abundant hair growth and maturation of hair follicle, where GAG coating serves as ECM, enhancing intrinsic therapeutic potential of DPCs [58]. During infection, the inflammatory cytokines secreted from host immune cells attract MSCs to the site of inflammation, which modulates inflammatory responses, representing MSCs as key candidate of regenerative medicine for infectious disease therapeutics. Coculture of macrophages (Mϕ) and adipose derived MSCs from Leishmania major (LM) susceptible and resistant mice demonstrates that AD-MSCs educate Mϕ against LM infection, differentially inducing M1 and M2 phenotype that represents AD-MSC as therapeutic agent for leishmanial therapy [93]. In summary, the multilineage differentiation potential of MSCs, as well as adoption of next-generation organoid culture system, avails MSCs as ideal regenerative medicine candidate.",
        "Umbilical cord, generally thrown at the time of child birth, is the best known source for stem cells, procured in noninvasive manner, having lesser ethical constraints than ESCs. Umbilical cord is rich source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and MSCs, which possess enormous regeneration potential [94] (Figure 5; Table 1). The HSCs of cord blood are responsible for constant renewal of all types of blood cells and protective immune cells. The proliferation of HSCs is regulated by Musashi-2 protein mediated attenuation of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signalling in stem cells [95]. UCSCs can be cryopreserved at stem cells banks (Figure 5; Table 1), in operation by both private and public sector organization. Public stem cells banks operate on donation formats and perform rigorous screening for HLA typing and donated UCSCs remain available to anyone in need, whereas private stem cell banks operation is more personalized, availing cells according to donor consent. Stem cell banking is not so common, even in developed countries. Survey studies find that educated women are more eager to donate UCSCs, but willingness for donation decreases with subsequent deliveries, due to associated cost and safety concerns for preservation [96]. FDA has approved five HSCs for treatment of blood and other immunological complications [97]. The amniotic fluid, drawn during pregnancy for standard diagnostic purposes, is generally discarded without considering its vasculogenic potential. UCSCs are the best alternatives for those patients who lack donors with fully matched HLA typing for peripheral blood and PBMCs and bone marrow [98]. One major issue with UCSCs is number of cells in transplant, fewer cells in transplant require more time for engraftment to mature, and there are also risks of infection and mortality; in that case ex vivo propagation of UCSCs can meet the demand of desired outcomes. There are diverse protocols, available for ex vivo expansion of UCSCs, reviewed elsewhere [99]. Amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs), coaxed to fibrin (required for blood clotting, ECM interactions, wound healing, and angiogenesis) hydrogel and PEG supplemented with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), give rise to vascularised tissue, when grafted to mice, suggesting that organoid cultures of UCSCs have promise for generation of biocompatible tissue patches, for treating infants born with congenital heart defects [59]. Retroviral integration of OCT4, KLF4, cMYC, and SOX2 transforms AFSCs into pluripotency stem cells known as AFiPSCs which can be directed to differentiate into extraembryonic trophoblast by BMP2 and BMP4 stimulation, which can be used for regeneration of placental tissues [60]. Wharton's jelly (WJ), the gelatinous substance inside umbilical cord, is rich in mucopolysaccharides, fibroblast, macrophages, and stem cells. The stem cells from UCB and WJ can be transdifferentiated into β-cells. Homogeneous nature of WJ-SCs enables better differentiation into β-cells; transplantation of these cells to streptozotocin induced diabetic mice efficiently brings glucose level to normal [7]. Easy access and expansion potential and plasticity to differentiate into multiple cell lineages represent WJ as an ideal candidate for regenerative medicine but cells viability changes with passages with maximum viable population at 5th-6th passages. So it is suggested to perform controlled expansion of WJ-MSCS for desired regenerative outcomes [9]. Study suggests that CD34+ expression leads to the best regenerative outcomes, with less chance of host-versus-graft rejection. In vitro expansion of UCSCs, in presence of StemRegenin-1 (SR-1), conditionally expands CD34+ cells [61]. In type I diabetic mellitus (T1DM), T-cell mediated autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells occurs, which has been considered as tough to treat. Transplantation of WJ-SCs to recent onset-T1DM patients restores pancreatic function, suggesting that WJ-MSCs are effective in regeneration of pancreatic tissue anomalies [62]. WJ-MSCs also have therapeutic importance for treatment of T2DM. A non-placebo controlled phase I/II clinical trial demonstrates that intravenous and intrapancreatic endovascular injection of WJ-MSCs to T2DM patients controls fasting glucose and glycated haemoglobin through improvement of β-cells functions, evidenced by enhanced c-peptides and reduced inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6) and T-cells counts [63]. Like diabetes, systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) also can be treated with WJ-MSCs transplantation. During progression of SLE host immune system targets its own tissue leading to degeneration of renal, cardiovascular, neuronal, and musculoskeletal tissues. A non-placebo controlled follow-up study on 40 SLE patients demonstrates that intravenous infusion of WJ-MSC improves renal functions and decreases systematic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG), and repeated infusion of WJ-MSCs protects the patient from relapse of the disease [64]. Sometimes, host inflammatory immune responses can be detrimental for HSCs transplantation and blood transfusion procedures. Infusion of WJ-MSC to patients, who had allogenic HSCs transplantation, reduces haemorrhage inflammation (HI) of bladder, suggesting that WJ-MSCs are potential stem cells adjuvant in HSCs transplantation and blood transfusion based therapies [100]. Apart from WJ, umbilical cord perivascular space and cord vein are also rich source for obtaining MSCs. The perivascular MSCs of umbilical cord are more primitive than WJ-MSCs and other MSCs from cord suggest that perivascular MSCs might be used as alternatives for WJ-MSCs for regenerative therapeutics outcome [101]. Based on origin, MSCs exhibit differential in vitro and in vivo properties and advocate functional characterization of MSCs, prior to regenerative applications. Emerging evidence suggests that UCSCs can heal brain injuries, caused by neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Krabbe's disease, and so forth. Krabbe's disease, the infantile lysosomal storage disease, occurs due to deficiency of myelin synthesizing enzyme (MSE), affecting brain development and cognitive functions. Progression of neurodegeneration finally leads to death of babies aged two. Investigation shows that healing of peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) tissues with Krabbe's disease can be achieved by allogenic UCSCs. UCSCs transplantation to asymptomatic infants with subsequent monitoring for 4–6 years reveals that UCSCs recover babies from MSE deficiency, improving myelination and cognitive functions, compared to those of symptomatic babies. The survival rate of transplanted UCSCs in asymptomatic and symptomatic infants was 100% and 43%, respectively, suggesting that early diagnosis and timely treatment are critical for UCSCs acceptance for desired therapeutic outcomes. UCSCs are more primitive than BMSCs, so perfect HLA typing is not critically required, representing UCSCs as an excellent source for treatment of all the diseases involving lysosomal defects, like Krabbe's disease, hurler syndrome, adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), and Sandhoff disease [65]. Brain injuries often lead to cavities formation, which can be treated from neuronal parenchyma, generated ex vivo from UCSCs. Coaxing of UCSCs into human originated biodegradable matrix scaffold and in vitro expansion of cells in defined culture conditions lead to formation of neuronal organoids, within three wks' time frame. These organoids structurally resemble brain tissue and consisted of neuroblasts (GFAP+, Nestin+, and Ki67+) and immature stem cells (OCT4+ and SOX2+). The neuroblasts of these organoids further can be differentiated into mature neurons (MAP2+ and TUJ1+) [66]. Administration of high dose of drugs in divesting neuroblastoma therapeutics requires immediate restoration of hematopoiesis. Although BMSCs had been promising in restoration of hematopoiesis UCSCs are sparely used in clinical settings. A case study demonstrates that neuroblastoma patients who received autologous UCSCs survive without any associated side effects [12]. During radiation therapy of neoplasm, spinal cord myelitis can occur, although occurrence of myelitis is a rare event and usually such neurodegenerative complication of spinal cord occurs 6–24 years after exposure to radiations. Transplantation of allogenic UC-MSCs in laryngeal patients undergoing radiation therapy restores myelination [102]. For treatment of neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), traumatic brain injuries (TBI), Parkinson's, SCI, stroke, and so forth, distribution of transplanted UCSCs is critical for therapeutic outcomes. In mice and rat, injection of UCSCs and subsequent MRI scanning show that transplanted UCSCs migrate to CNS and multiple peripheral organs [67]. For immunomodulation of tumor cells disease recovery, transplantation of allogenic DCs is required. The CD11c+DCs, derived from UCB, are morphologically and phenotypically similar to those of peripheral blood derived CTLs-DCs, suggesting that UCB-DCs can be used for personalized medicine of cancer patient, in need for DCs transplantation [103]. Coculture of UCSCs with radiation exposed human lung fibroblast stops their transdifferentiation, which suggests that factors secreted from UCSCs may restore niche identity of fibroblast, if they are transplanted to lung after radiation therapy [104]. Tearing of shoulder cuff tendon can cause severe pain and functional disability, whereas ultrasound guided transplantation of UCB-MSCs in rabbit regenerates subscapularis tendon in four wks' time frame, suggesting that UCB-MSCs are effective enough to treat tendons injuries when injected to focal points of tear-site [68]. Furthermore, transplantation of UCB-MSCs to chondral cartilage injuries site in pig knee along with HA hydrogel composite regenerates hyaline cartilage [69], suggesting that UCB-MSCs are effective regenerative medicine candidate for treating cartilage and ligament injuries. Physiologically circulatory systems of brain, placenta, and lungs are similar. Infusion of UCB-MSCs to preeclampsia (PE) induced hypertension mice reduces the endotoxic effect, suggesting that UC-MSCs are potential source for treatment of endotoxin induced hypertension during pregnancy, drug abuse, and other kinds of inflammatory shocks [105]. Transplantation of UCSCs to severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) patients restores neutrophils count from donor cells without any side effect, representing UCSCs as potential alternative for SCN therapy, when HLA matched bone marrow donors are not accessible [106]. In clinical settings, the success of myocardial infarction (MI) treatment depends on ageing, systemic inflammation in host, and processing of cells for infusion. Infusion of human hyaluronan hydrogel coaxed UCSCs in pigs induces angiogenesis, decreases scar area, improves cardiac function at preclinical level, and suggests that the same strategy might be effective for human [107]. In stem cells therapeutics, UCSCs transplantation can be either autologous or allogenic. Sometimes, the autologous UCSCs transplants cannot combat over tumor relapse, observed in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), which might require second dose transplantation of allogenic stem cells, but efficacy and tolerance of stem cells transplant need to be addressed, where tumor replace occurs. A case study demonstrates that second dose allogenic transplants of UCSCs effective for HL patients, who had heavy dose in prior transplant, increase the long term survival chances by 30% [10]. Patients undergoing long term peritoneal renal dialysis are prone to peritoneal fibrosis and can change peritoneal structure and failure of ultrafiltration processes. The intraperitoneal (IP) injection of WJ-MSCs prevents methylglyoxal induced programmed cell death and peritoneal wall thickening and fibrosis, suggesting that WJ-MSCs are effective in therapeutics of encapsulating peritoneal fibrosis [70]. In summary, UCB-HSCs, WJ-MSCs, perivascular MSCs, and UCB-MSCs have tissue regeneration potential.",
        "Bone marrow found in soft spongy bones is responsible for formation of all peripheral blood and comprises hematopoietic stem cells (producing blood cells) and stromal cells (producing fat, cartilage, and bones) [108] (Figure 6; Table 1). Visually bone marrow has two types, red marrow (myeloid tissue; producing RBC, platelets, and most of WBC) and yellow marrow (producing fat cells and some WBC) [108]. Imbalance in marrow composition can culminate to the diseased condition. Since 1980, bone marrow transplantation is widely accepted for cancer therapeutics [109]. In order to avoid graft rejection, HLA typing of donors is a must, but completely matched donors are limited to family members, which hampers allogenic transplantation applications. Since matching of all HLA antigens is not critically required, in that case defining the critical antigens for haploidentical allogenic donor for patients, who cannot find fully matched donor, might relieve from donor constraints. Two-step administration of lymphoid and myeloid BMSCs from haploidentical donor to the patients of aplastic anaemia and haematological malignancies reconstructs host immune system and the outcomes are almost similar to fully matched transplants, which recommends that profiling of critically important HLA is sufficient for successful outcomes of BMSCs transplantation. Haploidentical HLA matching protocol is the major process for minorities and others who do not have access to matched donor [71]. Furthermore, antigen profiling is not the sole concern for BMSCs based therapeutics. For example, restriction of HIV1 (human immune deficiency virus) infection is not feasible through BMSCs transplantation because HIV1 infection is mediated through CD4+ receptors, chemokine CXC motif receptor 4 (CXCR4), and chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) for infecting and propagating into T helper (Th), monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). Genetic variation in CCR2 and CCR5 receptors is also a contributory factor; mediating protection against infection has been reviewed elsewhere [110]. Engineering of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived CD4+ cells to express HIV1 antagonistic RNA, specifically designed for targeting HIV1 genome, can restrict HIV1 infection, through immune elimination of latently infected CD4+ cells. A single dose infusion of genetically modified (GM), HIV1 resistant HSPCs can be the alternative of HIV1 retroviral therapy. In the present scenario stem cells source, patient selection, transplantation-conditioning regimen, and postinfusion follow-up studies are the major factors, which can limit application of HIV1 resistant GM-HSPCs (CD4+) cells application in AIDS therapy [72, 73]. Platelets, essential for blood clotting, are formed from megakaryocytes inside the bone marrow [74]. Due to infection, trauma, and cancer, there are chances of bone marrow failure. To an extent, spongy bone marrow microenvironment responsible for lineage commitment can be reconstructed ex vivo [75]. The ex vivo constructed 3D-scaffolds consisted of microtubule and silk sponge, flooded with chemically defined organ culture medium, which mimics bone marrow environment. The coculture of megakaryocytes and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in this microenvironment leads to generation of functional platelets from megakaryocytes [75]. The ex vivo 3D-scaffolds of bone microenvironment can stride the path for generation of platelets in therapeutic quantities for regenerative medication of burns [75] and blood clotting associated defects. Accidents, traumatic injuries, and brain stroke can deplete neuronal stem cells (NSCs), responsible for generation of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Brain does not repopulate NSCs and heal traumatic injuries itself and transplantation of BMSCs also can heal neurodegeneration alone. Lipoic acid (LA), a known pharmacological antioxidant compound used in treatment of diabetic and multiple sclerosis neuropathy when combined with BMSCs, induces neovascularisation at focal cerebral injuries, within 8 wks of transplantation. Vascularisation further attracts microglia and induces their colonization into scaffold, which leads to differentiation of BMSCs to become brain tissue, within 16 wks of transplantation. In this approach, healing of tissue directly depends on number of BMSCs in transplantation dose [76]. Dental caries and periodontal disease are common craniofacial disease, often requiring jaw bone reconstruction after removal of the teeth. Traditional therapy focuses on functional and structural restoration of oral tissue, bone, and teeth rather than biological restoration, but BMSCs based therapies promise for regeneration of craniofacial bone defects, enabling replacement of missing teeth in restored bones with dental implants. Bone marrow derived CD14+ and CD90+ stem and progenitor cells, termed as tissue repair cells (TRC), accelerate alveolar bone regeneration and reconstruction of jaw bone when transplanted in damaged craniofacial tissue, earlier to oral implants. Hence, TRC therapy reduces the need of secondary bone grafts, best suited for severe defects in oral bone, skin, and gum, resulting from trauma, disease, or birth defects [77]. Overall, HSCs have great value in regenerative medicine, where stem cells transplantation strategies explore importance of niche in tissue regeneration. Prior to transplantation of BMSCs, clearance of original niche from target tissue is necessary for generation of organoid and organs without host-versus-graft rejection events. Some genetic defects can lead to disorganization of niche, leading to developmental errors. Complementation with human blastocyst derived primary cells can restore niche function of pancreas in pigs and rats, which defines the concept for generation of clinical grade human pancreas in mice and pigs [111]. Similar to other organs, diaphragm also has its own niche. Congenital defects in diaphragm can affect diaphragm functions. In the present scenario functional restoration of congenital diaphragm defects by surgical repair has risk of reoccurrence of defects or incomplete restoration [8]. Decellularization of donor derived diaphragm offers a way for reconstruction of new and functionally compatible diaphragm through niche modulation. Tissue engineering technology based decellularization of diaphragm and simultaneous perfusion of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) facilitates regeneration of functional scaffolds of diaphragm tissues [8]. In vivo replacement of hemidiaphragm in rats with reseeded scaffolds possesses similar myography and spirometry as it has in vivo in donor rats. These scaffolds retaining natural architecture are devoid of immune cells, retaining intact extracellular matrix that supports adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of seeded cells [8]. These findings suggest that cadaver obtained diaphragm, seeded with BM-MSCs, can be used for curing patients in need for restoration of diaphragm functions (Figure 6; Table 1). However, BMSCs are heterogeneous population, which might result in differential outcomes in clinical settings; however clonal expansion of BMSCs yields homogenous cells population for therapeutic application [8]. One study also finds that intracavernous delivery of single clone BMSCs can restore erectile function in diabetic mice [112] and the same strategy might be explored for adult human individuals. The infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) can cause liver cirrhosis and degeneration of hepatic tissue. The intraparenchymal transplantation of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) into liver tissue decreases aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), bilirubin, CD34, and α-SMA, suggesting that transplanted BMSCs restore hepatic functions through regeneration of hepatic tissues [113]. In order to meet the growing demand for stem cells transplantation therapy, donor encouragement is always required [8]. The stem cells donation procedure is very simple; with consent donor gets an injection of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) that increases BMSCs population. Bone marrow collection is done from hip bone using syringe in 4-5 hrs, requiring local anaesthesia and within a wk time frame donor gets recovered donation associated weakness.",
        "The field of iPSCs technology and research is new to all other stem cells research, emerging in 2006 when, for the first time, Takahashi and Yamanaka generated ESCs-like cells through genetic incorporation of four factors, Sox2, Oct3/4, Klf4, and c-Myc, into skin fibroblast [3]. Due to extensive nuclear reprogramming, generated iPSCs are indistinguishable from ESCs, for their transcriptome profiling, epigenetic markings, and functional competence [3], but use of retrovirus in transdifferentiation approach has questioned iPSCs technology. Technological advancement has enabled generation of iPSCs from various kinds of adult cells phasing through ESCs or direct transdifferentiation. This section of review outlines most recent advancement in iPSC technology and regenerative applications (Figure 7; Table 1). Using the new edge of iPSCs technology, terminally differentiated skin cells directly can be transformed into kidney organoids [114], which are functionally and structurally similar to those of kidney tissue in vivo. Up to certain extent kidneys heal themselves; however natural regeneration potential cannot meet healing for severe injuries. During kidneys healing process, a progenitor stem cell needs to become 20 types of cells, required for waste excretion, pH regulation, and restoration of water and electrolytic ions. The procedure for generation of kidney organoids ex vivo, containing functional nephrons, has been identified for human. These ex vivo kidney organoids are similar to fetal first-trimester kidneys for their structure and physiology. Such kidney organoids can serve as model for nephrotoxicity screening of drugs, disease modelling, and organ transplantation. However generation of fully functional kidneys is a far seen event with today's scientific technologies [114]. Loss of neurons in age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is the common cause of blindness. At preclinical level, transplantation of iPSCs derived neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) in rat limits progression of disease through generation of 5-6 layers of photoreceptor nuclei, restoring visual acuity [78]. The various approaches of iPSCs mediated retinal regeneration including ARMD have been reviewed elsewhere [79]. Placenta, the cordial connection between mother and developing fetus, gets degenerated in certain pathophysiological conditions. Nuclear programming of OCT4 knock-out (KO) and wild type (WT) mice fibroblast through transient expression of GATA3, EOMES, TFAP2C, and +/− cMYC generates transgene independent trophoblast stem-like cells (iTSCs), which are highly similar to blastocyst derived TSCs for DNA methylation, H3K7ac, nucleosome deposition of H2A.X, and other epigenetic markings. Chimeric differentiation of iTSCs specifically gives rise to haemorrhagic lineages and placental tissue, bypassing pluripotency phase, opening an avenue for generation of fully functional placenta for human [115]. Neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's and obstinate epilepsies can degenerate cerebrum, controlling excitatory and inhibitory signals of the brain. The inhibitory tones in cerebral cortex and hippocampus are accounted by γ-amino butyric acid secreting (GABAergic) interneurons (INs). Loss of these neurons often leads to progressive neurodegeneration. Genomic integration of Ascl1, Dlx5, Foxg1, and Lhx6 to mice and human fibroblast transforms these adult cells into GABAergic-INs (iGABA-INs). These cells have molecular signature of telencephalic INs, release GABA, and show inhibition to host granule neuronal activity [81]. Transplantation of these INs in developing embryo cures from genetic and acquired seizures, where transplanted cells disperse and mature into functional neuronal circuits as local INs [82]. Dorsomorphin and SB-431542 mediated inhibition of TGF-β and BMP signalling direct transformation of human iPSCs into cortical spheroids. These cortical spheroids consisted of both peripheral and cortical neurons, surrounded by astrocytes, displaying transcription profiling and electrophysiology similarity with developing fetal brain and mature neurons, respectively [83]. The underlying complex biology and lack of clear etiology and genetic reprogramming and difficulty in recapitulation of brain development have barred understanding of pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. 3D organoid cultures of ASD patient derived iPSC generate miniature brain organoid, resembling fetal brain few months after gestation. The idiopathic conditions of these organoids are similar with brain of ASD patients; both possess higher inhibitory GABAergic neurons with imbalanced neuronal connection. Furthermore these organoids express forkhead Box G1 (FOXG1) much higher than normal brain tissue, which explains that FOXG1 might be the leading cause of ASD [84]. Degeneration of other organs and tissues also has been reported, like degeneration of lungs which might occur due to tuberculosis infection, fibrosis, and cancer. The underlying etiology for lung degeneration can be explained through organoid culture. Coaxing of iPSC into inert biomaterial and defined culture leads to formation of lung organoids that consisted of epithelial and mesenchymal cells, which can survive in culture for months. These organoids are miniature lung, resemble tissues of large airways and alveoli, and can be used for lung developmental studies and screening of antituberculosis and anticancer drugs [87]. The conventional multistep reprogramming for iPSCs consumes months of time, while CRISPER-Cas9 system based episomal reprogramming system that combines two steps together enables generation of ESCs-like cells in less than two wks, reducing the chances of culture associated genetic abrasions and unwanted epigenetic [80]. This approach can yield single step ESCs-like cells in more personalized way from adults with retinal degradation and infants with severe immunodeficiency, involving correction for genetic mutation of OCT4 and DNMT3B [80]. The iPSCs expressing anti-CCR5-RNA, which can be differentiated into HIV1 resistant macrophages, have applications in AIDS therapeutics [88]. The diversified immunotherapeutic application of iPSCs has been reviewed elsewhere [89]. The α-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD) encoded by serpin peptidase inhibitor clade A member 1 (SERPINA1) protein synthesized in liver protects lungs from neutrophils elastase, the enzyme causing disruption of lungs connective tissue. A1AD deficiency is common cause of both lung and liver disease like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and liver cirrhosis. Patient specific iPSCs from lung and liver cells might explain pathophysiology of A1AD deficiency. COPD patient derived iPSCs show sensitivity to toxic drugs which explains that actual patient might be sensitive in similar fashion. It is known that A1AD deficiency is caused by single base pair mutation and correction of this mutation fixes the A1AD deficiency in hepatic-iPSCs [85]. The high order brain functions, like emotions, anxiety, sleep, depression, appetite, breathing heartbeats, and so forth, are regulated by serotonin neurons. Generation of serotonin neurons occurs prior to birth, which are postmitotic in their nature. Any sort of developmental defect and degeneration of serotonin neurons might lead to neuronal disorders like bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia-like psychiatric conditions. Manipulation of Wnt signalling in human iPSCs in defined culture conditions leads to an in vitro differentiation of iPSCs to serotonin-like neurons. These iPSCs-neurons primarily localize to rhombomere 2-3 segment of rostral raphe nucleus, exhibit electrophysiological properties similar to serotonin neurons, express hydroxylase 2, the developmental marker, and release serotonin in dose and time dependent manner. Transplantation of these neurons might cure from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other neuropathological conditions [116]. The iPSCs technology mediated somatic cell reprogramming of ventricular monocytes results in generation of cells, similar in morphology and functionality with PCs. SA note transplantation of PCs to large animals improves rhythmic heart functions. Pacemaker needs very reliable and robust performance so understanding of transformation process and site of transplantation are the critical aspect for therapeutic validation of iPSCs derived PCs [28]. Diabetes is a major health concern in modern world, and generation of β-cells from adult tissue is challenging. Direct reprogramming of skin cells into pancreatic cells, bypassing pluripotency phase, can yield clinical grade β-cells. This reprogramming strategy involves transformation of skin cells into definitive endodermal progenitors (cDE) and foregut like progenitor cells (cPF) intermediates and subsequent in vitro expansion of these intermediates to become pancreatic β-cells (cPB). The first step is chemically complex and can be understood as nonepisomal reprogramming on day one with pluripotency factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and hair pin RNA against p53), then supplementation with GFs and chemical supplements on day seven (EGF, bFGF, CHIR, NECA, NaB, Par, and RG), and two weeks later (Activin-A, CHIR, NECA, NaB, and RG) yielding DE and cPF [86]. Transplantation of cPB yields into glucose stimulated secretion of insulin in diabetic mice defines that such cells can be explored for treatment of T1DM and T2DM in more personalized manner [86]. iPSCs represent underrated opportunities for drug industries and clinical research laboratories for development of therapeutics, but safety concerns might limit transplantation applications (Figure 7; Table 1) [117]. Transplantation of human iPSCs into mice gastrula leads to colonization and differentiation of cells into three germ layers, evidenced with clinical developmental fat measurements. The acceptance of human iPSCs by mice gastrula suggests that correct timing and appropriate reprogramming regime might delimit human mice species barrier. Using this fact of species barrier, generation of human organs in closely associated primates might be possible, which can be used for treatment of genetic factors governed disease at embryo level itself [118]. In summary, iPSCs are safe and effective for treatment of regenerative medicine.",
        "The unstable growth of human population threatens the existence of wildlife, through overexploitation of natural habitats and illegal killing of wild animals, leading many species to face the fate of being endangered and go for extinction. For wildlife conservation, the concept of creation of frozen zoo involves preservation of gene pool and germ plasm from threatened and endangered species (Figure 8). The frozen zoo tissue samples collection from dead or live animal can be DNA, sperms, eggs, embryos, gonads, skin, or any other tissue of the body [119]. Preserved tissue can be reprogrammed or transdifferentiated to become other types of tissues and cells, which opens an avenue for conservation of endangered species and resurrection of life (Figure 8). The gonadal tissue from young individuals harbouring immature tissue can be matured in vivo and ex vivo for generation of functional gametes. Transplantation of SSCs to testis of male from the same different species can give rise to spermatozoa of donor cells [120], which might be used for IVF based captive breeding of wild animals. The most dangerous fact in wildlife conservation is low genetic diversity, too few reproductively capable animals which cannot maintain adequate genetic diversity in wild or captivity. Using the edge of iPSC technology, pluripotent stem cells can be generated from skin cells. For endangered drill, Mandrillus leucophaeus, and nearly extinct white rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum cottoni, iPSC has been generated in 2011 [121]. The endangered animal drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus) is genetically very close to human and often suffers from diabetes, while rhinos are genetically far removed from other primates. The progress in iPSCs, from the human point of view, might be transformed for animal research for recapturing reproductive potential and health in wild animals. However, stem cells based interventions in wild animals are much more complex than classical conservation planning and biomedical research has to face. Conversion of iPSC into egg or sperm can open the door for generation of IVF based embryo; those might be transplanted in womb of live counterparts for propagation of population. Recently, iPSCs have been generated for snow leopard (Panthera uncia), native to mountain ranges of central Asia, which belongs to cat family; this breakthrough has raised the possibilities for cryopreservation of genetic material for future cloning and other assisted reproductive technology (ART) applications, for the conservation of cat species and biodiversity. Generation of leopard iPSCs has been achieved through retroviral-system based genomic integration of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC, and NANOG. These iPSCs from snow leopard also open an avenue for further transformation of iPSCs into gametes [122]. The in vivo maturation of grafted tissue depends both on age and on hormonal status of donor tissue. These facts are equally applicable to accepting host. Ectopic xenografts of cryopreserved testis tissue from Indian spotted deer (Moschiola indica) to nude mice yielded generation of spermatocytes [123], suggesting that one-day procurement of functional sperm from premature tissue might become a general technique in wildlife conservation. In summary, tissue biopsies from dead or live animals can be used for generation of iPSCs and functional gametes; those can be used in assisted reproductive technology (ART) for wildlife conservation.",
        "The spectacular progress in the field of stem cells research represents great scope of stem cells regenerative therapeutics. It can be estimated that by 2020 or so we will be able to produce wide array of tissue, organoid, and organs from adult stem cells. Inductions of pluripotency phenotypes in terminally differentiated adult cells have better therapeutic future than ESCs, due to least ethical constraints with adult cells. In the coming future, there might be new pharmaceutical compounds; those can activate tissue specific stem cells, promote stem cells to migrate to the side of tissue injury, and promote their differentiation to tissue specific cells. Except few countries, the ongoing financial and ethical hindrance on ESCs application in regenerative medicine have more chance for funding agencies to distribute funding for the least risky projects on UCSCs, BMSCs, and TSPSCs from biopsies. The existing stem cells therapeutics advancements are more experimental and high in cost; due to that application on broad scale is not feasible in current scenario. In the near future, the advancements of medical science presume using stem cells to treat cancer, muscles damage, autoimmune disease, and spinal cord injuries among a number of impairments and diseases. It is expected that stem cells therapies will bring considerable benefits to the patients suffering from wide range of injuries and disease. There is high optimism for use of BMSCs, TSPSCs, and iPSCs for treatment of various diseases to overcome the contradictions associated with ESCs. For advancement of translational application of stem cells, there is a need of clinical trials, which needs funding rejoinder from both public and private organizations. The critical evaluation of regulatory guidelines at each phase of clinical trial is a must to comprehend the success and efficacy in time frame.",

        "Promises of stem cells in regenerative medicine: the six classes of stem cells, that is, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), tissue specific progenitor stem cells (TSPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), umbilical cord stem cells (UCSCs), bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have many promises in regenerative medicine and disease therapeutics.",
        "ESCs in regenerative medicine: ESCs, sourced from ICM of gastrula, have tremendous promises in regenerative medicine. These cells can differentiate into more than 200 types of cells representing three germ layers. With defined culture conditions, ESCs can be transformed into hepatocytes, retinal ganglion cells, chondrocytes, pancreatic progenitor cells, cone cells, cardiomyocytes, pacemaker cells, eggs, and sperms which can be used in regeneration of tissue and treatment of disease in tissue specific manner.",
        "TSPSCs in regenerative medicine: tissue specific stem and progenitor cells have potential to differentiate into other cells of the tissue. Characteristically inner ear stem cells can be transformed into auditory hair cells, skin progenitors into vascular smooth muscle cells, mesoangioblasts into tibialis anterior muscles, and dental pulp stem cells into serotonin cells. The 3D-culture of TSPSCs in complex biomaterial gives rise to tissue organoids, such as pancreatic organoid from pancreatic progenitor, intestinal tissue organoids from intestinal progenitor cells, and fallopian tube organoids from fallopian tube epithelial cells. Transplantation of TSPSCs regenerates targets tissue such as regeneration of tibialis muscles from mesoangioblasts, cardiac tissue from AdSCs, and corneal tissue from limbal stem cells. Cell growth and transformation factors secreted by TSPSCs can change cells fate to become other types of cell, such that SSCs coculture with skin, prostate, and intestine mesenchyme transforms these cells from MSCs into epithelial cells fate.",
        "MSCs in regenerative medicine: mesenchymal stem cells are CD73+, CD90+, CD105+, CD34−, CD45−, CD11b−, CD14−, CD19−, and CD79a− cells, also known as stromal cells. These bodily MSCs represented here do not account for MSCs of bone marrow and umbilical cord. Upon transplantation and transdifferentiation these bodily MSCs regenerate into cartilage, bones, and muscles tissue. Heart scar formed after heart attack and liver cirrhosis can be treated from MSCs. ECM coating provides the niche environment for MSCs to regenerate into hair follicle, stimulating hair growth.",
        "UCSCs in regenerative medicine: umbilical cord, the readily available source of stem cells, has emerged as futuristic source for personalized stem cell therapy. Transplantation of UCSCs to Krabbe's disease patients regenerates myelin tissue and recovers neuroblastoma patients through restoring tissue homeostasis. The UCSCs organoids are readily available tissue source for treatment of neurodegenerative disease. Peritoneal fibrosis caused by long term dialysis, tendon tissue degeneration, and defective hyaline cartilage can be regenerated by UCSCs. Intravenous injection of UCSCs enables treatment of diabetes, spinal myelitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and congenital neuropathies. Cord blood stem cells banking avails long lasting source of stem cells for personalized therapy and regenerative medicine.",
        "BMSCs in regenerative medicine: bone marrow, the soft sponge bone tissue that consisted of stromal, hematopoietic, and mesenchymal and progenitor stem cells, is responsible for blood formation. Even halo-HLA matched BMSCs can cure from disease and regenerate tissue. BMSCs can regenerate craniofacial tissue, brain tissue, diaphragm tissue, and liver tissue and restore erectile function and transdifferentiation monocytes. These multipotent stem cells can cure host from cancer and infection of HIV and HCV.",
        "iPSCs in regenerative medicine: using the edge of iPSCs technology, skin fibroblasts and other adult tissues derived, terminally differentiated cells can be transformed into ESCs-like cells. It is possible that adult cells can be transformed into cells of distinct lineages bypassing the phase of pluripotency. The tissue specific defined culture can transform skin cells to become trophoblast, heart valve cells, photoreceptor cells, immune cells, melanocytes, and so forth. ECM complexation with iPSCs enables generation of tissue organoids for lung, kidney, brain, and other organs of the body. Similar to ESCs, iPSCs also can be transformed into cells representing three germ layers such as pacemaker cells and serotonin cells.",

    "title": "Inhibition of HDAC activity directly reprograms murine embryonic stem cells to trophoblast stem cells. embryonic germ layers. ESCs can also generate totipotent 2C-like cells and trophectodermal cells. However, these latter transitions occur at low frequency due to epigenetic barriers, the nature of which is not fully understood. Here, we show that treating mouse ESCs with sodium butyrate (NaB) increases the population of 2C-like cells and enables direct reprogramming of ESCs into trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) without a transition through a 2C-like state. Mechanistically, NaB inhibits histone deacetylase activities in the LSD1-HDAC1/2 corepressor complex. This increases acetylation levels in the regulatory regions of both 2C- and TSC-specific genes, promoting their expression. In addition, NaB-treated cells acquire the capacity to generate blastocyst-like structures that can develop beyond the implantation stage in vitro and form deciduae in vivo. These results identify how epigenetics restrict the totipotent and trophectoderm fate in mouse ESCs.

        "In eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged into chromatin, with the nucleosome serving as its fundamental unit. Each nucleosome consists of approximately 148 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of core histone proteins, comprising two copies each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1). This packaging typically creates a repressive environment for gene expression. Therefore, transcriptional activation often requires chromatin modifications. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are two enzymes that regulate chromatin structure and function by adding and removing acetyl groups on lysine residues of core nucleosomal histones, respectively. The acetylation of histones H3 and H4 neutralizes the positive charge of lysine residues, leading to chromatin relaxation and enhanced accessibility for transcriptional activation. In contrast, histone deacetylation promotes chromatin condensation, thereby suppressing gene transcription (2, 3). Consequently, the dynamic equilibrium between acetylation and deacetylation levels plays a pivotal role in regulating physiological processes, cellular fate determination, and the pathogenesis of diseases. Growing evidence suggests that members of the HDAC family exhibit extensive functional heterogeneity during tumorigenesis and cancer progression. These enzymes contribute to oncogenic activation, inactivation of tumor suppressor pathways, metabolic adaptation, and alterations in the immune microenvironment, collectively driving malignant progression (4). Given the tumor-promoting properties of HDACs, targeted inhibition of HDAC activity has emerged as a critical therapeutic strategy in oncology. Although first-generation pan-HDAC inhibitors (HDACis), such as Vorinostat and Romidepsin, have been clinically approved for treating specific lymphomas, their off-target effects and drug resistance issues have limited broader clinical applications (5). Current research focuses on developing subtype-selective HDACis, exploring biomarker-guided precision dosing regimens, and designing combination therapeutic strategies integrating HDACis with chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, or targeted agents to overcome current therapeutic efficacy limitations. This review systematically elucidates the pathological regulatory networks of HDACs in malignancies, dissects the mechanisms of action and pharmacological properties of HDACis, summarizes advancements in preclinical and clinical studies, and discusses future directions to optimize epigenetic-targeted therapies, thereby providing a scientific foundation for refining antitumor strategies.",
        "The enzymatic capacity to remove acetyl groups from histones was first documented in 1969 through biochemical characterization of calf thymus extracts (6), though initial purification efforts using conventional chromatographic techniques proved unsuccessful. The field underwent transformative advancement in 1996 with the molecular cloning of HDAC1, the first bona fide histone deacetylase identified (7). Subsequent genomic analyses revealed 18 human HDACs categorized into four distinct classes based on sequence homology, subcellular localization, and enzymatic cofactor requirements. Notably, Classes I, II, and IV enzymes (HDAC1-11) are zinc-dependent hydrolases, whereas Class III sirtuins (SIRT1-7) utilize NAD+ as an essential cofactor for their catalytic activity (\nFigure 1\n). This phylogenetic classification reflects both conserved catalytic domains and divergent regulatory mechanisms across evolutionary lineages.",
        "HDAC Family.",
        "The Class I HDACs (HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8) are most closely related to the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) transcriptional regulator Rpd3 (8). It has now been widely stated in the literature that Class I HDACs are located in the nucleus and are widely expressed. More thorough findings reveal that HDAC3 expression is restricted to certain tissues, and HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 can localize in the cytoplasm or specialized cellular organelles (9).",
        "The Class II HDACs have homology to yeast HDAC1, and are further subdivided into two subclasses, IIa and IIb, based on sequence homology and domain organization. The Class IIa HDACs, HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9, contain a highly conserved C-terminal deacetylase catalytic domain (*420 amino acids) homologous to yHda1 and share an N-terminal domain (*450–600 amino acids) with no similarity to HDACs in other classes. The N-terminal domain mediates interactions with the myocyte enhancer factor 2 transcription factor family, transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein, and others. Class IIa HDACs shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus and their expression is tissue-specific. The Class IIb HDACs, HDAC6 and -10 are characterized by the presence of two catalytic HDAC domains arranged in tandem. Class IIb HDACs are predominantly cytoplasmic and expressed in a limited number of cell types (10, 11).",
        "Class III HDACs are distinct from Class I and II and are homologous of the yeast silent information regulator 2 (Sir2). Sir2 enzymes (or sirtuins) are NAD (+)-dependent deacetylases that regulate gene silencing, aging, and energy metabolism. Earlier experiments showed that overexpression of Sir2 in yeast induced global deacetylation of histones, suggesting that Sir2 is an HDAC (12). Later, in a study by Frye et al. (13) the bacterial homolog of Sir2, cobB, was found to have ribosyltransferase activity, leading to experiments showing that Sir2 can also transfer adenosine-ribose (ADP-ribose) from nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NAD). Subsequently, it was confirmed that Sir2 is an NAD-dependent HDAC and that the ADP-ribosylation of acetylated lysine residues is an intermediate state of the Sir2-catalyzed enzymatic reaction (14). Only Class III enzymes uses NAD as a cofactor. Therefore, they are referred to as NAD-dependent HDACs. Each of the seven mammalian sirtuin proteins (called SIRT1-SIRT7) has a different subcellular localization. SIRT1, SIRT6 and SIRT7 are localized in the nucleus, while SIRT2 is mainly cellular membrane and SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5 seem to be present only in mitochondria. Although much is known about SIRT1, relatively little is known about the other Sirt family proteins (15). What is interesting is that some sirtuins have been recently shown to have additional enzymatic activities in addition to deacetylation, such as SIRT3 showing additional norylase activity, SIRT4 showing ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, SIRT5 with desmalonylase, desuccinylase and deglutaminase activities, and SIRT6 showing deacetylase and demyristoylase activities, which were further elaborated in the study by Chen et al (16).",
        "It cannot be ignored that the role of some current sirtuins in tumorigenesis is still controversial. In a study by Heltweg et al. (17) it was demonstrated that SIRT1 is expressed at higher levels in cancer cells and promotes tumorigenesis through deacetylation of lysine 382 in Burkitt’s lymphoma cells. However, in a mouse model of cancer constructed by Firestein et al. (18) increased SIRT1 expression inhibited cell proliferation and tumor formation.",
        "HDAC11 was first reported in 2002 only and is the smallest of the HDAC isoforms, with its catalytic domain accounting for > 80% of the protein sequence. It is mainly localized in the nucleus and plays an important role in immune regulation as a transcriptional regulator (19). HDAC11 is predominantly expressed in smooth muscle, heart, kidney and brain tissues (20), and is likely to be preferentially expressed in the gallbladder (21).",
        "The location and biological functions of HDACs are detailed in \nTable 1\n.",
        "Location and biological function of HDACs.",
        "There are several main classes of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis), including those based on hydroxamic acid (e.g., suberoylanilide hydroxamic (SAHA), pyroxamide, trichostatin A (TSA), oxamflatin, cyclic hydroxamic acid-containing peptides (CHAP)s; LAQ824; BL1521); cyclic tetra/peptide (e.g., depsipeptide, trapoxin, apicidin, CHAPs); synthetic benzamide derivatives (e.g., MS-275 and CI-994); cyclic tetrapeptides (e.g., depsipeptide, trapoxin, apicidin, CHAPs); and short-chain fatty acids (e.g., sodium butyrate (SB), AN-9; phenylbutyrate (PB);phenylacetate (PA); valproic acid) (22).",
        "The recent discovery of hydrazide-based HDACi further increases the diversity of HDACi (23, 24). Four HDACi are currently approved by the FDA (25–29) (\nTable 2\n). The first class of HDACi is hydroxyamide acid-based HDACi. Vorinostat is well-known as the first marketed HDACi with nanomolar affinity for HDACs. Initially, relevant studies suggested that this compound was able to inhibit all HDACs. However, further testing demonstrated that it could only inhibit HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 6 at reasonable concentrations (30). Currently, vorinostat is FDA-approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Amino-benzamide-based HDACi are the first inhibitors to selectively target Class I HDACs (31), and enzyme kinetic studies have shown that the aminobenzamide motif has a tight binding mechanism (slow-on/slow-off) and differs from classical fast on/fast off kinetics associated with hydroxamide acid-based HDACi (32–34). Entinostat is the first amino-benzamide-based HDACi to reach clinical trials (35). Recently, Wang et al (24) reported a novel HDACi family with a previously unutilized motif in HDACi.",
        "HDACis currently under clinical investigations.",
        "CTCL, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma; PTCL, peripheral T-cell lymphoma; MM, multiple myeloma; MDS, myelodysplastic syndromes; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; ABL, acute biphenotypic leukemia; DLBCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; AITL, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma; ENKTCL, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma; cHL, classical Hodgkin lymphoma; R/R lymphoma, relapsed or refractory lymphoma.",
        "While the substrate specificity and biological functions of individual HDAC isoforms remain incompletely characterized, accumulating evidence has unequivocally established HDACs as central epigenetic orchestrators of oncogenic processes. Through dynamic deacetylation of both histone (e.g., H3K9, H4K16) and non-histone substrates (e.g., p53, STAT3, HIF-1α), HDACs mechanistically govern six hallmark cancer pathways: (1) cell cycle progression via CDK inhibitor silencing, (2) apoptosis resistance through Bcl-2 family modulation, (3) DNA damage tolerance by repair factor inactivation, (4) autophagic flux dysregulation, (5), VEGF-driven angiogenesis, and (6) EMT-mediated metastatic dissemination. In particular, recent studies have given great attention to the epigenetic regulation involved in HDAC. This functional pleiotropy positions HDACs as master regulators linking epigenetic plasticity to tumor microenvironment remodeling, but precise mechanistic mapping requires systematic subtype and context-specific interrogation (\nFigure 2\n).",
        "Mechanism of action of HDACis in cancer.",
        "The precise coordination of cell cycle progression is fundamental to maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis, governed by a tightly regulated network of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), checkpoint proteins, and epigenetic modifiers. Among these regulators, histone deacetylases (HDACs) have emerged as critical players that bridge epigenetic dynamics with cell cycle control. By modulating the acetylation status of histones (e.g., H3K9, H4K16) and non-histone substrates (e.g., p53, E2F, Rb), HDACs exert spatiotemporal control over the transcription of cell cycle-related genes, DNA replication licensing, and mitotic fidelity.",
        "The G1/S phase transition represents a critical checkpoint in the cell cycle, determining whether a cell commits to proliferation or exits the cycle into quiescence. Previous studies have confirmed that HDAC1 and HDAC2 bind to the promoter regions of the p21 and p57 genes, thereby inhibiting their expression and regulating the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle (5). Fan et al. found that knockdown of HDAC5 led to a significant upregulation of p21 and a notable downregulation of cyclin D1 and CDK2/4/6, resulting in a strong G1-phase cell cycle arrest and inhibiting cell proliferation (36). Similarly, Qiu et al. (37) demonstrated that HDACi induce G1 arrest by upregulating p21. HDACi also reduce CDK activity by downregulating cyclins, leading to Rb dephosphorylation and inhibition of E2F activity, affecting G1 progression and G1/S transition (38). While HDACi-induced growth arrest is mainly linked to p21 induction, some evidence points to a p21-independent pathway. For instance, Trichostatin A (TSA) activates the p15Ink4b gene, inducing growth inhibition in colon cancer cells lacking p21 (39). Additionally, a study by Yamashita et al. (40) showed that TSA increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, causing G0/G1 phase arrest.",
        "In addition to regulating the G1/S transition, HDACi have also been shown to interfere with the G2/M transition. HDAC1 knockdown in tumor cells disrupts G2/M progression and inhibits cell growth (41). Li et al. (42) demonstrated that HDAC10 controls G2/M transition by regulating cyclin A2 expression. Similarly, Kim et al. (43) showed that MHY218, a hydroxamic acid derivative, induces G2/M arrest in colon cancer cells through p21 upregulation, independent of p53. TSA further supports this by increasing p21 levels while decreasing Cyclin B1, Plk1, and Survivin, delaying G2/M progression (44). Interestingly, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) causes a G1 phase block at low concentrations, but both G1 and G2/M blocks at higher concentrations (45).",
        "Beyond transcriptional suppression of cell cycle genes at G1/S and G2/M checkpoints, HDACs may also regulate the cell cycle through transcription-independent mechanisms. For instance, the HDAC3-AKAP95/HA95 Aurora B pathway is essential for normal mitosis, as shown by Li et al (46). Additionally, LBH589, an HDAC inhibitor, prevents the degradation of Aurora A and B kinases by inhibiting HDAC3 and HDAC6, leading to G2/M arrest and apoptosis in renal cancer cells (47). HDAC3 also regulates the stability of cyclin A via acetylation, which is crucial for S phase progression and mitosis entry (48).",
        "Overall, HDACi can block the cell cycle at the G1/S or G2/M phases, highlighting HDAC as a potential therapeutic target for abnormal cell growth in cancer.",
        "The regulation of apoptosis—a genetically programmed cell death mechanism—is intricately governed by the dynamic interplay between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signals, with HDACs emerging as pivotal modulators of this life-or-death equilibrium. HDACs exert dualistic control over apoptotic pathways through both epigenetic silencing of apoptosis-related genes and direct post-translational modification of key apoptotic executors. By deacetylating histones (e.g., H3K9, H4K16) at promoters of pro-apoptotic factors (BAX, PUMA, NOXA) and tumor suppressors (p53), HDACs enforce transcriptional repression under homeostatic conditions, favoring cell survival. Conversely, stress stimuli (e.g., DNA damage, oxidative stress) trigger HDAC inhibition or degradation, leading to chromatin relaxation and reactivation of apoptotic machinery. Apoptosis has been shown to be induced through two major signaling pathways, referred to as the endogenous and exogenous pathways, mediated by mitochondria and death receptors, respectively (49). This section Outlines the relationship between HDAC and apoptosis in terms of different apoptotic pathways, dissects their significance in the development and treatment of cancer, and evaluates strategies for selectively manipulating HDAC activity to restore apoptosis.",
        "The extrinsic apoptotic pathway, initiated by extracellular death ligands (e.g., FasL, TRAIL) binding to transmembrane receptors (e.g., Fas, DR4/DR5), is tightly regulated by HDACs through both epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms. HDACs modulate this pathway by altering the expression of death receptors, suppressing pro-apoptotic signaling, or directly modifying key apoptotic executors, thereby influencing cellular sensitivity to extrinsic death stimuli. The regulation of HDACi on TRAIL-induced apoptosis has been described in detail in the review of Fulda et al. (50), including the up-regulation of TRAIL receptor expression on the cell surface and the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (such as cFLIP) by HDACi, so that cancer cells are in a state of TRAIL-triggered apoptosis. Xia et al. (51) confirmed that downregulation of c-Jun expression in response to osmotic pressure was caused by transcriptional repression through caspase-7-dependent HDAC3 cleavage, which involved FAS ligand and MEK2-dependent caspase-8 activation. The downregulation of c-Jun promoted the osmotic stress-induced apoptosis.",
        "The intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway, activated by intracellular stress signals such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, or metabolic imbalance, is critically regulated by HDACs through their dual roles in chromatin remodeling and direct modulation of mitochondrial apoptosis executors. HDACs orchestrate the balance between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, govern mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), and fine-tune caspase activation, thereby determining cellular commitment to life or death. Activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway appears to be the major mechanism by which HDACi induces tumor cell death. In many cases, HDACi activates the intrinsic pathway by up-regulating some BH3-only pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family genes including Bim, Bid and Bmf (\n52). Furthermore, recent studies have shown that HDACi can comprehensively alter the expression of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family genes, suggesting a pro-apoptotic biological response (53). Emerging evidence highlights the tumor-suppressive effects of HDAC2 depletion across cancer types. Jung et al. (54) demonstrated that HDAC2 silencing inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in human lung cancer cells via coordinated activation of p53 and Bax alongside Bcl-2 downregulation. Notably, Kim et al. (55) further revealed that targeted HDAC2 inactivation in gastric cancer cells restores pro-apoptotic activity of Bax, AIF, and Apaf-1 while suppressing Bcl-2, independent of p53 protein level alterations. This suggests HDAC2 ablation triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis through p53-independent mechanisms. However, the role of p53 in HDACi-mediated apoptosis remains context-dependent (56–59). Sonnemann et al. (60) observed that vorinostat, apicidin, and valproic acid exert antitumor effects largely independent of p53 status, whereas entinostat-induced cytotoxicity partially relies on p53 functionality. These findings collectively underscore the heterogeneous p53 dependency among HDACis, emphasizing the need for compound-specific mechanistic characterization. Notably, MHY218, an HDACi, significantly increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in a concentration-dependent manner and activated caspases-3, -8, and -9, indicating that it induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways (43). It seems that the different effects of HDACi in the same cell type may be caused by the structural characteristics of the different HDACi.",
        "The maintenance of genomic stability relies on a sophisticated network of DNA damage response (DDR) pathways that detect, signal, and repair lesions to prevent mutagenesis and cell death. HDACs, traditionally recognized as chromatin-modifying enzymes, have recently been implicated as critical regulators of DDR through their dual roles in modulating chromatin architecture and direct interactions with DNA repair machinery. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are lethal lesions detected by DNA damage signaling mechanisms, and most are repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR) (61). NHEJ is a highly efficient process that joins DNA ends with minimal processing (62), while HR uses undamaged homologous sequences to ensure precise repair (63). Miller et al. (64) demonstrated that loss of HDAC1 or HDAC2 renders cells highly sensitive to DNA-damaging agents and exhibit persistent DNA damage signals, phenotypes that confirm defective DSBs repair, particularly through the NHEJ pathway. Specifically, depletion of HDAC9 or HDAC10 by RNA interference can specifically inhibit HR, leading to increased sensitivity to mitomycin C (65). Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a master regulator of DNA damage response, promoting the activation of BRCA1, CHK2, and p53, which induces DNA repair response genes such as p21, GADD45A, and RRM2B. Previous studies by Thurn et al. (66) confirmed that selective silencing of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in vitro and in vivo is sufficient to modulate ATM activation, reduce GADD45A and RRM2B induction, and increase sensitivity to DNA strand breaks. Moreover, another study (67) found that silencing HDAC2 gene could alleviate the ATM/p53-mediated cell death pathway in osteosarcoma U2OS cells in response to adriamycin, confirming that HDAC2 is involved in the early molecular events of DNA damage response and is a coactivator of p53. HDAC6 has long been thought to play a unique role due to its cytosolic localization and ability to deacetylate non-histone proteins (68). The study by Yang et al. (69) confirmed that HDAC6 can regulate DDR-related genes by affecting Sp1 expression, eliminating DNA damage induced by MPT0B291, an HDAC6 inhibitor, providing evidence for MPT0B291 as a potential compound for glioblastoma (GBM) therapy. Strikingly, recent studies have revealed that HDAC6 functions as a valine sensor, which is retained in the nucleus upon valine deprivation, where it binds to and deacetylates ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2). This process promotes DNA damage through thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG)-driven excision, thereby unveiling a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment (70). In particular, in the latest study by Yao et al. (71), IHCH9033, a new selective class I HDACi, can selectively inhibit DNA repair in FLT3-ITD AML cells, leading to DNA damage accumulation and overcoming resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. Research on HDACi in DNA damage and repair is still developing, but it is known that therapeutic doses of HDACi not only induce DNA damage but also impair repair mechanisms, sensitizing cells to ionizing radiation (IR), topoisomerase inhibitors, and cisplatin (72–74).",
        "Mammalian sirtuins (SIRT 1-7), which belong to NAD+ -dependent class III HDACs, have different modes of action, targets and subcellular compartments, and play unique roles in DNA damage and repair. SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has been demonstrated to directly interact with and deacetylate multiple core DNA repair factors, including Ku70 (15) (critical for non-homologous end joining), apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-1 (APE1) (base excision repair effector) (75), NBS1 (nibrin/p95, a central component of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 [MRN] complex for DNA damage sensing) (76), and xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) (key mediator of nucleotide excision repair) (77). This post-translational modification modulates their enzymatic activities, subcellular localization, and recruitment to DNA lesion sites, thereby fine-tuning repair fidelity across distinct DNA damage response pathways. The relationship between SIRT1 and DNA damage response has been elaborated in recent reviews, including the interaction with different proteins in the major DNA repair mechanisms and DDR pathway, recruiting them to DNA damage foci or activating proteins involved in DNA repair through deacetylation (78). Previous studies have found that SIRT5 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), and knockdown of SIRT5 impairs the production of ribo-5-phosphate, which is required for nucleotide synthesis, resulting in continuous and irreparable DNA damage. This results in CRC cell cycle arrest and significant apoptosis, indicating that SIRT5 can be a promising target for CRC therapy (79). SIRT6 plays a critical role in DNA repair by enhancing resistance to DNA damage and maintaining genomic stability, particularly through base excision repair (BER), as demonstrated by Mostoslavsky et al. (80). Moreover, SIRT6-deficient mice exhibit decreased chromatin-associated levels of SNF2H in specific tissues, a finding that correlates with elevated DNA damage (81). In addition, research by Mao et al. (82) has shown that SIRT6 interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and catalyzes its mono-ADP-ribosylation at lysine 521, thereby enhancing PARP1 activity and facilitating the repair of DSBs under oxidative stress conditions. Members of the SIRT family play multifaceted roles in DNA damage repair, exerting effects that are equally as important as those of classical HDACs.",
        "The interplay between HDACs and autophagy represents a pivotal nexus in cellular adaptation to metabolic stress, genomic instability, and environmental challenges. Emerging evidence underscores HDACs as dual regulators of autophagy, operating through both epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms to fine-tune autophagic flux. By deacetylating histones (e.g., H3K9, H4K16) at promoters of autophagy-related genes (ATG5, LC3, BECN1), HDACs suppress basal autophagy under nutrient-replete conditions, while their inhibition or stress-induced degradation triggers transcriptional activation of autophagic machinery (83–85). The effects of autophagy on cancer development and the interaction between autophagy and HDAC have been described in detail in the latest review by Koeneke et al (86).",
        "Early work by Moresi et al. (87) demonstrated that the simultaneous deletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in mice inhibited autophagosome formation. Similarly, Kang et al. (88) found that knockdown of HDAC4 induced autophagy, increasing LC3-II, Beclin-1, and ATG7 levels. Not only that, the researchers found that LC3-II increased over time when HDAC5 was depleted in breast cancer cells, and this effect was enhanced with the use of lysosomal inhibitors, suggesting that HDAC5 downregulation increased autophagic flux (89). HDAC6 is involved in the regulation of autophagy at multiple levels, including post-translational modification (PTM) of transcription factors involved in autophagy-related transcription (90, 91), formation of aggregates routinely cleared through the autophagic pathway (92, 93), and transport and degradation of autophagosomes (94). Liu et al. (95) observed that the level of acetylated phosphotidylethanolamine (PE)-conjugated LC3B (LC3B-II) was increased in cells treated with tubacin, a specific inhibitor of HDAC6, under normal medium. However, tubacin only partially inhibited serum starvation-induced deacetylation of LC3B-II, suggesting that HDAC6 is not the only deacetylase acting on LC3B-III during serum starvation-induced autophagy. Therefore, HDAC6 depletion impairs serum starvation-induced autophagy. The post-transcriptional modification (PTM) of autophagy-related transcription factors, such as transcription factor EB (TFEB) and forkhead box 1 (FOXO1), notably affects their activity and thus regulates the autophagy-lysosome pathway (96), and current studies have reported that HDAC6 deacetylates TFEB and FOXO1 to reduce their activity and inhibit autophagy (91, 97, 98). In addition, in a study (99) on breast cancer, it was also found that HDAC6 knockdown resulted in reduced LC3B protein and reduced autophagy. Another work (100) showed that productive autophagy with efficient autophagosome-lysosome fusion is dependent on HDAC10 and that depletion of HDAC10 enhances the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin.",
        "Sirtuins on autophagy in cancer has been detailed in a recent review by Aventaggiato et al. (101) and will not be repeated here.",
        "Hypoxia is a common characteristic of many solid tumors, where tumor cells in hypoxic regions adapt to low oxygen conditions by activating several survival pathways. Among these, the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcription factor is the most well-known mechanism employed by hypoxic cells in this hostile microenvironment. Notably, there is a strong correlation between HIF-1 and tumor angiogenesis (102). As a result, drugs that inhibit HIF-1 expression hold significant potential as antitumor agents. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor, consisting of two subunits: HIF-1α (or its analogs HIF-2α and HIF-3α) and HIF-1β. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) have been shown to significantly reduce HIF-1α expression and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials, partly due to their potent anti-angiogenic effects. However, the precise mechanism by which HDACIs function as HIF-1α inhibitors remains unclear.",
        "The research of Yoo et al. (103) demonstrated that the expression of metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) is strongly induced under hypoxic conditions, and MTA1 promotes the deacetylation of HIF-1α by upregulating histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). In a separate study by Geng et al. (104), it was shown that acetylation of the HIF-1α protein increased with HDAC4 shRNA and decreased with HDAC4 overexpression. In contrast, HDAC5 and 6 promote the maturation and stabilization of HIF-1α by deacetylating its chaperones HSP70 and HSP90 (105, 106). Lim et al. (107) observed that SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of HIF-1α at Lys674 inhibits HIF-1α activity by preventing the recruitment of p300. Under hypoxic conditions, SIRT1 inhibition creates a positive feedback loop that maintains high levels of HIF-1 activity.",
        "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key angiogenic factor that promotes angiogenesis in various pathological conditions, including inflammation, ischemic diseases, and cancer. In a report by Ray et al. (108) involving breast cancer, it was found that Kruppel-like factor-4 (KLF-4) recruits HDAC2 and HDAC3 at the VEGF promoter and represses their transcription, and that upregulation of VEGF in cancer is associated with loss of KLF-4-HDAC-mediated transcriptional repression. In another research (109), it was confirmed that silencing of HDAC5 increased the expression of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and angiogenesis directing factors including Slit2. Kaluza et al. (110) found that HDAC6 interacts with and deacetylates the actin remodeling protein cortactin in endothelial cells (ECs), thereby regulating endothelial cell migration and germination. However, in another study, it was found that knockdown of HDAC6 significantly upregulated the expression of HIF-1α and VEGFA in vivo and in vitro and promoted HIF-1α-mediated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) angiogenesis (111). Turtoi et al. (112) were the first to show that HDAC7 epigenetically targets the AKAP12 tumor/angiogenesis suppressor gene. Not surprisingly, HDAC regulates angiogenesis through a variety of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors.",
        "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process in cancer cell invasion and metastasis, with recent studies highlighting the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in regulating EMT across various cancers. EMT is marked by the loss of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin (CDH1), and several transcriptional repressors of CDH1 have been identified, including Snail, Slug, Twist, ZEB1, and ZEB2. The breakdown of the basement membrane (BM) barrier allows cancer cells to directly invade the surrounding stromal region, a process driven by active proteolysis, primarily through the action of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (113).",
        "The recruitment of HDACs to the CDH1 promoter has been shown to be regulated by the transcription factor ZEB1, as first demonstrated by Aghdassi et al. in their study on pancreatic cancer (114). In research on pancreatic cancer (115), the genetic inactivation of E-cadherin (encoded by the CDH1 gene) was found to induce EMT and promote metastasis in vivo. The silencing of E-cadherin was mediated by a transcriptional repressor complex involving Snail, HDAC1, and HDAC2. Additionally, this Snail/HDAC1/HDAC2 complex is essential for EZH2-mediated repression of CDH1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (116). A previous study (117) confirmed that class I HDAC inhibitors enhance the acetylation of Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) and increase oxidative stress, thereby blocking sarcoma metastasis. More recently, it was shown that DNTTIP1 represses DUSP2 gene expression by recruiting HDAC1 to its promoter, maintaining the deacetylated state of histone H3K27 (118), and downregulation of DUSP2 leads to abnormal activation of ERK signaling and elevated MMP2 levels, which promote metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In a research by Ma et al. (119), the cytoplasmic expression of HDAC3 was found to be upregulated in brain metastases from breast cancer, while its nuclear expression was conversely downregulated. This suggests that HDAC3 plays a key role in the development and progression of brain metastases in breast cancer patients, though the study did not explore the underlying mechanisms in detail. Additionally, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), another non-histone substrate of HDAC6, is primarily responsible for promoting protein maturation and maintaining protein structure (120), which is crucial for the stability and function of proteins involved in tumor metastasis (121). Recent studies (122) have shown that targeted inhibition of HDAC6 increases the acetylation of HSP90, which weakens the binding between HSP90 and ATP, thereby reducing the interaction between chaperone proteins and oncogenes. Additionally, cytoplasmic linker protein 170 (CLIP-170), a microtubule-binding protein, regulates cell motility by modulating microtubule dynamics. In a study by Li et al. (123) HDAC6 was found to interact with CLIP-170 and the two proteins acted together to stimulate the migration of pancreatic cancer cells. Additionally, HDAC6, a novel estrogen-regulated gene, was found to have increased expression in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer MCF-7 cells, as reported by Saji et al (124). Elevated HDAC6 expression enhanced cell motility by promoting its binding to α-tubulin and increasing microtubule (MT) activity. This finding was further confirmed in a separate study on neuroblastoma (125). HDAC8 is highly expressed in breast cancer compared to other types of cancers. In a study (126) triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), HDAC8 was found to promote TNBC cell migration by regulating Hippo-YAP signaling. Additionally, HDAC8 was shown to drive breast cancer cell dissemination through the AKT/GSK-3β/Snail signaling pathway (127). Not only that, HDAC8 cooperates with the SMAD3/4 complex to inhibit SIRT7 and promote cell survival and migration (128). HDAC8 promotes cancer metastasis by suppressing maspin expression in prostate cancer (129). HDAC8 also promotes glioma migration by regulating the acetylation levels of α-tubulin (130). Additionally, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ID2-AS1, which downregulates inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2), enhanced ID2 transcription by blocking HDAC8 occupancy at the ID2 enhancer region, thereby inhibiting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invasion and migration both in vitro and in vivo (131). In a study by Song et al. (132) on cervical cancer, it was confirmed that HDAC10 suppresses the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, genes known to be critical for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, HDAC11 was found to inhibit the migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells by downregulating MMP3 expression (133).",
        "In prostate cancer, SIRT1 was found to promote cell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo by synergistically inhibiting CDH1 transcription alongside ZEB1 (134). Furthermore, a study by Eades et al. (135) on breast cancer showed that SIRT1 overexpression was associated with reduced levels of miR-200a, which normally acts as a negative regulator of SIRT1 and suppresses EMT. A similar mechanism was identified in oral cancer, where research by Chen et al. (136) demonstrated the key role of the SIRT1/Smad4/MMP7 pathway in the EMT process.",
        "HDACs, beyond their canonical roles in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression, have emerged as pivotal regulators of immune cell differentiation, activation, and functional polarization. By dynamically modulating the acetylation status of both histones (e.g., H3K9, H4K16) and non-histone immune-related proteins (e.g., STATs, NF-κB, Foxp3), HDACs fine-tune the expression of cytokines, chemokines, and immune checkpoint molecules, thereby shaping innate and adaptive immune responses. Early studies by Xiao et al. (137) have confirmed that HDAC5 can reduce immune responses and the de novo expansion of T regulatory (Treg) cells, highlighting the importance of HDAC5 in antitumor immune responses. Recent research has also found that HDAC5 regulates PD-L1 expression by directly interacting with NF-κB p65. Therefore, silencing or inhibiting HDAC5 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma can sensitize tumors to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (138). Foxp3 is a key transcription factor of Treg cells, and its expression and activity level are determined by post-translational modification. In the transplantation environment, regulating the acetylation or deacetylation of key lysine residues of Foxp3 can promote its stability and function, thus regulating the generation and activity of Tregs. The role of HDACs in regulating Treg function has been described in detail in the latest review by Wang et al (139). In particular, the latest research found that targeting HDAC3 could enhance CXCL12 secretion through the ATF3 dependent pathway, thereby stimulating the recruitment and activation of NK cells and inhibiting the progression of T-cell lymphoma (140). Regarding HDACi, ACY241, a selective inhibitor of HDAC6, has been shown to significantly reduce the frequency of CD138+MM cells, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, and HLA-DRLow/-CD11b+CD33+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Reduced immune checkpoint PD1/PD-L1 expression in CD8+T cells and bone marrow cells from myeloma patients. ACY241 increases the expression of B7 (CD80, CD86) and MHC (class I, class II) in tumor and dendritic cells. ACY241 also enhanced the antitumor activity of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in a dose - and time-dependent manner, as indicated by increased production of perforin/CD107a, IFN-γ/IL-2/TNF-α, and antigen-specific central memory CD8+ T cells (141).",
        "Stem cells, with their unparalleled capacity for self-renewal and lineage-specific differentiation, serve as the cornerstone of tissue homeostasis and regenerative medicine. HDACs, long recognized as epigenetic modifiers, have recently emerged as master regulators of stem cell fate, dynamically balancing pluripotency maintenance and differentiation through both chromatin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In the latest study (142), inhibition of histone deacetylase activity in LSD1-HDAC1/2 corepressor complex by sodium butyrate (NaB) increased the number of 2C-like cells in mouse embryonic hepatocytes and directly reprogrammed embryonic hepatocytes into trophoblast stem cells. Paradoxically, dysregulated HDAC activity drives pathological stemness in cancer stem cells (CSCs), where aberrant deacetylation stabilizes oncogenic transcription programs (e.g., Wnt/β-catenin, Notch) and confers therapy resistance (143). This duality underscores the context-dependent roles of HDAC isoforms, positioning them as both guardians of regenerative capacity and accomplices in malignant transformation. The latest study (144) found that the combination of HDACi CS055 and chiglitazar can synergistically act on leukemia cell lines and leukemia stem cell-like cells in patient samples. Chiglitazar enhanced the inhibitory effect of CS055 on HDAC3 by down-regulating the expression of SLC7A11, an inhibitor of ferroptosis, and induced ferroptosis in leukemia stem cell-like cells. HDAC profoundly affects the pluripotency, differentiation and therapeutic application of stem cells by regulating chromatin dynamics and signaling pathways, which still needs to be further explored in the future.",
        "HDAC and HDACi have shown extraordinary potential in the treatment of cancer, and widely regulate the key processes of tumorigenesis. However, they still face many challenges. Firstly, the efficacy of HDACi as a single agent in solid tumors is insufficient, which may be partially related to tumor heterogeneity, microenvironment hypoxia and poor drug permeability (145, 146). Moreover, most of the existing HDACis are broad-spectrum inhibitors, lack of subtype selectivity, and have hematologic and cardiac-related toxicity (147). In addition, predictive markers for efficacy of HDACi have not been clearly defined, leading to a dilemma in patient stratification. In summary, HDAC and HDACi are the new candidates for epigenetic regulation, and their future development needs to break through the bottleneck of solid tumor efficacy, improve subtype selectivity, and further identify HDAC-related markers to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment. Combined treatment strategies (such as HDACi + immunotherapy or targeted drugs) and precision medicine models (individualized treatment based on molecular subtypes) are the directions we need to actively explore in the future to finally achieve the “precision endurance” of cancer treatment.",

        "Degenerative eye disorders refer to a collection of irreversible diseases characterized by the gradual deterioration of ocular cells, leading to eventual cell death. Conventional therapies for degenerative eye disorders primarily aim to slow disease progression, but long-term benefits rely on the restoration and regeneration of damaged ocular tissue. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that have not yet committed to a specific lineage.1 They have the ability to undergo division and can be induced to differentiate into various mature and functional cell types, which makes them a valuable tool. Stem cell therapy shows promise as a potential treatment for degenerative disorders, such as neurological disorders, heart diseases, and discogenic back pain, and thus significant efforts have been dedicated to its exploration. Numerous studies have demonstrated the potential of various cell types for regenerating ocular tissues, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). Regarding the classification of clinical studies, most of the current studies are classified as phase I, with a primary focus on examining the adverse reactions and complications associated with the application of stem cell therapy (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). During the course of the investigation, various issues impede the advancement of the study. Non-autologous cell-based transplants pose a potential concern of rejection and may require recipients to undergo immune suppression. This obstacle can potentially be mitigated by utilizing cells sourced from closely related or human leukocyte antigen-matched individuals, or the patients themselves. In summary, this article provides an overview of the current advancements in utilizing stem cells for the regeneration of ocular tissue. Additionally, we explore the ocular disorders targeted by stem cell therapy and examine the perspectives and challenges within this field. Several ongoing/completed clinical trials are currently being conducted that make use of stem cells for treating human ocular diseases, as outlined in Table-1. We also summarize promising new techniques in the stem cell therapy in ocular disorders (Fig. 3).Fig. 1Ocular diseases targeted by stem cell therapy through ocular tissue regeneration.

        "Limbal stem cells (LSCs) are a type of adult stem cells located at the limbus, which possess the ability to differentiate into corneal epithelium. limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) occurs when there is inadequate or impaired activity of LSCs.2 Individuals with LSCD frequently exhibit symptoms including reduced vision, dryness, redness, irritation, photophobia, blepharospasm, symblepharon, and pain. Initially, they may remain asymptomatic.3",
        "Since the groundbreaking work of Kenyon and Tseng in 1989,4 when they pioneered ocular stem cell therapy through limbal tissue transplantation, the field has witnessed tremendous growth. Various sources for tissue transplantation have been explored, including cultivated limbal epithelium, conjunctival epithelium, oral mucosal epithelium (OME), dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), hair follicle-derived stem cells (HFSCs), human ESCs, and iPSCs.",
        "Treatment for LSCD primarily relies on limbal autografting techniques, including conjunctival limbal autografting (CLAU), cultivated limbal epithelium transplantation (CLET), and simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET).5",
        "CLAU, first described by Kenyon and Tseng in 1989, is associated with various complications such as infection, scarring, and chronic inflammation due to the large graft area.6 To improve treatment outcomes and mitigate risks, several improvements, including CLET and SLET, have been developed utilizing either autologous or allogenic tissue. Reports have shown that CLET requires a smaller dose of donor's limbal epithelium, reducing the risk of complications, and favorable results have been reported.7, 8, 9, 10 Some researchers reported that autologous CLET has high long-term survival rates and greater safety compared to allogenic CLET.11 In some cases of partial LSCD where stem cell transplantation may not be necessary, Sharma et al. have suggested the use of amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) alone as a therapeutic modality, which has comparable curative effect to cultivated LSCs transplantation.12 Sangwan et al. introduced a novel surgical technique called SLET, involving the extraction of a small biopsy of healthy eye limbal tissue. This tissue is then divided into 8–10 pieces and placed on fresh human amniotic membrane adhered to the diseased eye's scraped corneal bed. SLET simplifies the procedure as cell expansion occurs in vivo, reducing treatment time and costs.13 An ongoing clinical trial (ISRCTN12217540) is comparing the effectiveness of CLET and SLET in treating LSCD in ocular burn patients. Another innovative approach involves the transplantation of LSCs cultured on the concave surface of a siloxane-hydrogel extended-wear contact lens, which has shown promising results. The contact lens approach offers the advantages of being autologous, xeno-free, cost-effective, and easily accessible.14 Additionally, Miguel et al. have developed a tissue-engineered scaffold using a fibrin and agarose mixture, where corneal epithelial cells, corneal fibroblasts, and corneal endothelial cells are co-cultured.15 These co-cultured fibrin-agarose scaffolds exhibit optimal mechanical and optical behavior similar to native human corneas, and have demonstrated high biocompatibility in animal models.16",
        "Besides the corneal epithelium, the conjunctival epithelium can be used as an alternative source of cells for ocular surface reconstruction. Conjunctival epithelium and corneal epithelial cells are the most similar stratified epithelial tissues that exist in the body.17 Patients with a range of ocular surface problems have had successful conjunctival regeneration through the transplantation of autologous conjunctival epithelial cells that are cultivated outside the body.18,19 With positive results noted, this method has also been applied to corneal surface reconstruction in patients with LSCD.20 In summary, the conjunctival epithelium, with its close resemblance to corneal epithelial cells, offers a promising cell source for ocular surface reconstruction.",
        "According to current knowledge, the pool of stem cells capable of regenerating corneal tissue for the treatment of LSCD encompasses OME, DPSC, HFSC, iPSC, and ESC. OME, a non-limbal cell type utilized for therapeutic purposes, has gained broad application in the treatment of LSCD, with researchers worldwide reporting encouraging outcomes.21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 Instances of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, having an immunological basis and potentially affecting the oral mucosa, are included.28 DPSCs share important characteristics with LSCs in the eye and can be administered via a contact lens.29 The current study provides evidence that HFSCs can differentiate into a phenotype phenotypically similar to corneal epithelial cells for reconstructing the ocular surface in LSCD mice.30 Owing to uncontrolled proliferation, non-specific differentiation, transplantation rejection, tumorigenesis, and ethical concerns, clinical trials applying ESCs as grafts have several limitations. Previous studies have demonstrated different strategies for corneal epithelial cell differentiation from human iPSCs.31,32 Nevertheless, there is a lack of reported clinical studies on the use of iPSCs for treating LSCD.",
        "Impaired tear film homeostasis and ocular symptoms are the hallmarks of dry eye diseases (DED), a multifactorial illness of the ocular surface.33 Common symptoms of DED are ocular discomfort and blurred vision, which adversely affect visual function and quality of life. MSCs are multipotent stem cells that have been shown to reduce inflammation and enhance tissue repair when transplanted in vivo. Studies have demonstrated that injecting a product consisting of allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) to the lacrimal gland is a safe and feasible treatment for severe DED with aqueous deficiency.34 An extremely dangerous long-term side effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (cGVHD).35 Inflammation and fibrosis in patients with cGVHD often result in severe dry eye syndrome. Patients’ symptoms improved following intravenous injection of MSCs, resulting in improved dry eye symptoms and Schirmer test results.36 Administering exosomes derived from MSCs (MSC-exo) as eye drops significantly alleviate dry eye disease associated with cGVHD.37",
        "Keratoconus is a progressive eye condition characterized by corneal thinning, protrusion, and distortion, leading to vision loss caused by irregular astigmatism.38 Traditional treatments for keratoconus involve corneal transplantation techniques, such as penetrating or lamellar transplantation. However, these methods have limitations, including graft rejection, slow visual recovery,38 and limited availability of donor corneal tissue.39 Tissue engineering of the corneal stroma aims to overcome these challenges but is currently hindered by the complex structure of the cornea.40 Stem cell therapy for corneal stroma has gained attention as a potential solution as stem cells can not only prolifrate and differentiate into mature corneal cells, but also secret new collagen within the corneal stroma.41,42",
        "To our current understanding, the sole published clinical data pertaining to the regeneration and therapeutic application of stem cells in the human corneal stroma originates from an earlier investigation conducted by Alio et al.43, 44, 45, 46 In their research, patients diagnosed with keratoconus were divided into three experimental groups, with individuals receiving transplantation of autologous adipose-derived adult stem cells (ADASCs), transplantation of decellularized corneal stromal lamina, and transplantation of recellularized lamina containing ADASCs, respectively.47 Larger sample numbers and additional study are required to confirm the effectiveness of these treatments.",
        "Bullous keratopathy is a corneal disease resulting from endothelial decompensation. Patients with bullous keratopathy may experience impaired vision and ocular discomfort due to epithelial damage and stromal edema. Occasionally, visual acuity following corneal transplantation may be unsatisfactory due to irregularities in the corneal structure induced by surgery. Corneal endothelial cells (CECs) were successfully utilized in an initial clinical trial involving 11 patients diagnosed with bullous keratopathy and exhibiting a deficiency of detectable CECs.48 Cells passaged from human corneal endothelium and supplemented with a rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor were injected into the chosen treatment eye's anterior chamber. After 24 weeks post-injection, the transparency of the cornea was restored, and there was an observed rise in CEC density.",
        "In the mature lens, lens epithelial stem/progenitor cells (LECs) cover the anterior surface of the lens and initiate differentiation into lens fibers at the equatorial region. LECs play crucial roles in sustaining self-renewal and protecting against external injuries, highlighting their important functions.49 Lin et al.50 demonstrated a significant 11-fold increase in LEC numbers following the complete surgical removal of lens contents while preserving the empty capsular bag scaffold, indicative of the robust regenerative capability of human LECs after injury. Nevertheless, the disordered proliferation of residual LECs subsequent to surgery can result in the development of visual axis opacification (VAO), thereby increasing the risk of cataracts, a primary cause of global blindness. With the present approach to pediatric cataract surgery, the emergence of visually significant posterior capsule opacification is anticipated in almost all patients within weeks or months following the surgical procedure, attributable to the abnormal proliferation of residual LECs. To mitigate the occurrence of VAO, Lin and colleagues developed and implemented a novel capsulorhexis technique during pediatric cataract surgery to safeguard the regenerative capacity of LECs.50 Distinguishing it from the conventional approach for pediatric cataract surgery, Lin's method substantially decreases wound size and relocates the capsulorhexis opening from the central visual axis to the periphery. Findings from the clinical trial demonstrated the functionality of the regenerated lenses and a remarkable 20-fold reduction in complications, including VAO, endorsing the superior efficacy and safety of the innovative treatment. Substantial advancements have been achieved in the investigation of exogenous LSCs. Yao and colleagues51 successfully utilized induced lentoid bodies (LBs) derived from urinary human induced pluripotent stem cells (UiPSCs) to create an in vitro model of congenital cataract. This model provides a robust platform for studying the pathogenesis of cataract and screening potential drug candidates for cataract treatment. Furthermore, Yao and colleagues52 successfully achieved in situ lens regeneration using cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), resulting in the thickest and most transparent lens documented thus far. They also demonstrated the participant of the Wnt/PCP pathway in the process of lens regeneration, which offers novel therapeutic approaches and insights into cataract development.",
        "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the primary cause of irreversible blindness, affecting over 70 million individuals globally. Glaucoma is a degenerative disease that leads to severe headache and visual loss due to the progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. Maintaining a precise intraocular pressure (IOP) is the responsibility of the trabecular meshwork (TM), which offers resistance to the outflow of aqueous humor. In contrast to traditional treatments, stem cell therapy directly targets the TM, facilitating its repopulation and function restoration. Trabecular meshwork stem cells (TMSCs) have shown the ability to actively migrate to the TM region and differentiate into TM cells when injected into the anterior chamber of a normal mouse.53 Moreover, studies have demonstrated that iPSC-derived TM cells restored TM function associated with IOP in ex vivo experiments using human anterior segments54 and in in vivo glaucoma mouse models.55, 56, 57, 58 Additionally, injecting MSCs into the ocular anterior chamber has a neuroprotective effect in glaucoma, which is comparable to the effect of TMSCs.59,60 To ensure targeted delivery of stem cells to the TM region, magnetic nanoparticles were employed for labeling MSCs, enabling their magnetic steering towards the TM after injection into the anterior chamber of mouse models’ eyes. This approach demonstrated high efficiency, preserving stem cell viability and multipotency.61 Sara et al. proposed a novel phase I clinical study to investigate the regeneration of the TM.62 Based on their description, ADMSCs were recommended for human clinical trials due to their potential to reduce the risk of immune rejection and tumorigenesis.63 Additionally, MSCs are readily available and can be obtained through minimally invasive procedures. To assess TM function following implantation, tonography and imaging techniques based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) would provide valuable insights.64, 65, 66 Further preclinical and clinical studies are required to enhance our understanding of stem cell therapy for glaucoma.",
        "The retina, a stratified sensory tissue, encompasses various cell types, such as retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, photoreceptors, intermediate neurons, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and glial cells. This diverse array of cell types, as highlighted with RPE cells, photoreceptors, intermediate neurons, RGCs, and glial cells, holds promising potential for application in stem cell therapy.",
        "Retinal degenerative diseases (RDDs) are a group of irreversible diseases characterized by the progressive degeneration of retinal cells. Examples of RDDs include diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma, which ultimately result in cell death. Imbalances in the retinal microenvironment contribute to retinal degeneration.67",
        "Stem cell therapy is an effective approach to restore retinal function and treat RDDs, as the retina has limited regenerative capacity. Stem cells used in therapy can be sourced from RPC, ESC, iPSCs, MSC, and neural precursor cells (NPCs). Delivery strategies for stem cell therapy include encapsulated cell technology, polymer scaffolds, and retinal sheets. Various strategies are employed to avoid immune rejection, a common complication of cell transplantation.68 Using patient-specific autologous iPSC-derived cells is an ideal approach to achieve host-recipient match.69 However, the process of reprogramming and testing can be time-consuming and costly for personalized medicine. As an alternative, generating pools of HLA-matched lines is being actively pursued. Finding people that are homozygous for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and creating certain induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) lines that may match a sizable fraction of the transplant recipient population are the two steps in the procedure.70,71 According to a recent study, nearly 40% of the Korean population is represented by the most prominent 10 HLA-homozygous iPSC lines.72 A different strategy is to introduce HLA-E genes at the B2M locus73 and knock down both alleles of β2-microglobulin (β2M)74 to create HLA-engineered lines. The immune system does not perceive these cells as allogeneic. As a result, they might be a good source for general donor cells.",
        "The pigment cells known as RPE cells are in charge of carrying nutrients from the circulatory system to photoreceptors and breaking down decomposing disks from the photoreceptors' outer segment.75",
        "Graft rejection poses a significant concern for allogeneic transplants, and achieving major histocompatibility complex (MHC) matching is crucial for successful RPE transplantation. Studies have demonstrated that chronic rejection is mediated through the expression of MHC II.76 Additionally, the immunologic response has been found to be influenced by the number of transplanted cells, which increases over time.77,78 In vivo experiments with MHC-matched animal models have shown no signs of rejection in iPSC-derived RPE allografts, even without the use of immunosuppression. Conversely, MHC-mismatched models exhibited immune attacks around the graft and resulting damage to the retinal tissue.79 Studies conducted in vitro have shown that HLA-matched iPSC-derived RPE cells taken from HLA homozygous donors did not elicit a response from human T cells80",
        "AMD is a degenerative disease that leads to blindness and is primarily caused by the loss or dysfunction of RPE. The absence of RPE results in the degeneration of a majority of the photoreceptors located above, resulting in a significant and progressive loss of vision. Results from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that RPE replacement techniques may be able to impede the disease's progression and restore vision. While attempts have been made to transplant primary RPE in humans, the outcomes have been inconsistent in terms of graft survival and improvement of visual acuity.81 Utilizing stem cell derived cells offers significant advantages, such as an almost limitless cell supply and the ability to control their differentiation to guarantee optimal safety and potency prior to transplantation.",
        "To find out if transplanting hESC-derived RPE into the subretinal space is safe and tolerable, numerous prospective clinical investigations were carried out.82, 83, 84, 85 These studies have reported improvements in BCVA, indicating promising early results for the use of transplanted hESC-RPE cells in alleviating AMD. In a phase I clinical study, patients with dry AMD showed an improvement in vision from 21 ETDRS letters to 28 following subretinal transplantation of hESC-derived RPE. Additionally, within 4 months, the hESC-derived RPE cells showed no evidence of hyperproliferation, tumorigenicity or apparent rejection.86 In another study, a highly mismatched donor RPE monolayer, implanted subretinally into a highly degenerate retina, demonstrated long-term survival and function for 2 years. The study also provided evidence of limited immunogenicity for the allogeneic hESC-RPE cells.87 It is thought that a very modest number of CD8 cytotoxic T cells in the implant location let these highly mismatch RPE cells survive and avoid being destroyed. In addition to the subretinal injection of hRPE, Kashani et al. have invented a new clinical-grade retinal implant composed of hESC-derived RPE that is cultivated on an ultrathin, synthetic parylene substrate designed to mimic Bruch's membrane.88 Results at 1 year indicate that the implant is safe and well tolerated in individuals with advanced dry AMD.89 Regarding cell delivery methods, the injection of RPE cell suspension has a drawback because it only distributes a small number of cells over a damaged basal lamina, with unpredictable results.90,91 An alternative technique to the injection of RPE cell suspension is the transplantation of RPE-choroid sheets. Although there is a significant chance of postoperative complications with this approach, it provides a consistent cell sheet of polarized RPE on its basal lamina. Christiane and colleagues assessed the outcome of the two RPE transplantation methods.92 Their findings demonstrated comparable anatomical and functional outcomes for both techniques.",
        "Stargardt's disease (STGD1) is one of the most common hereditary forms of juvenile macular degeneration. Initially, patients' central vision is impaired. As the lipofuscin in apical RPE cells accumulate, the patients reported diminished vision, which results in secondary choroidal neovascularization and legal blindness.93",
        "In order to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of subretinal injection of hESC-RPE cell suspension in the early stage of STGD1, many clinical trials were carried out,94, 95, 96 in which none of the patients experienced adverse reactions systemically or locally. However, changes of long-term visual function were mixed. Another study conducted a detailed analysis of retinal anatomy and function using microperimetry and spectral-domain OCT.97 While no evidence of uncontrolled growth or inflammatory responses was found in any of the 12 participants, microperimetry indicated no benefits at 12 months for any of them. There was a possibility of injury since one person taking the maximum dose experienced localized retinal thinning and reduced sensitivity in the hyperpigmented region. Therefore, it is essential to consider the careful implementation of protective treatments following a longer duration of observation due to the slow rate of progressive degeneration in RDDs. In addition to hESCs, MSCs are also utilized for the treatment of STGD1. A phase II study involved the suprachoroidal implantation of ADMSCs in four patients. There were no signs of systemic or ocular complications, and all STGD1 patients showed improvements in visual field, and visual acuity during the six-month follow-up.98 However, the study's patient population size was insufficient to permit a conclusive statistical analysis.",
        "Photoreceptor replacement is practical since it is a unidirectional sensory neuron that requires just a single, brief synaptic connection, which might be produced from numerous sources such as RPCs, ESCs, iPSCs, and so on.",
        "Located within the inner layer of the optic cup, RPCs are a type of NPC,99 possessing a similar proliferative capacity as stem cells. The specific properties of stem cells, including proliferation and differentiation, make RPC transplantation a promising approach for treating retinal diseases.",
        "Researchers have discovered that co-culturing RPCs with hESC-RPE cells leads to an increased survival rate of RPCs in vitro.100 This may be attributed to the high levels of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) secreted by polarized RPE cells.101 These findings provide additional evidence supporting the idea that co-transplantation of integrated RPE and photoreceptor layers can be an effective method to maximize curative outcomes.",
        "Single pigmented ciliary margin cells have the potential to differentiate into various retinal-specific cell types, including rod photoreceptors, bipolar neurons, and Müller glia. This indicates that these cells could serve as a viable substrate for retinal regeneration.102",
        "RP encompasses a range of inherited diseases characterized by problems adjusting to darkness and night blindness in adolescence, loss of the mid-peripheral visual field in early adulthood, and eventual loss of central vision as a result of severe rod and cone photoreceptor degeneration.103 RP is a prevalent hereditary retinal disease, affecting approximately 1 in 4000 individuals.103",
        "The first clinical trial to investigate the long-term safety of transplanting human fetal neuroretinal cells into RP patients was conducted by Taraprasad and colleagues in 1999.104 The study reported no complications in the host eyes. While initial follow-up showed improved light sensitivity, this improvement diminished between 3 and 13 months. In a similar trial, Liu et al. observed significant improvement in visual acuity for five out of eight patients between 2 and 6 months post-RPCs injection, but this improvement was not maintained at the 12-month mark.105 Another clinical trial demonstrated visual acuity score improvements for 50% of RP patients treated with neural RPC layers and RPE transplantation,106 providing evidence of the safety and benefits of retinal implants. Using the questionnaire, Rubens et al. examined the quality of life of RP patients who underwent intravitreal injection of autologous bone marrow MSCs (ABMSCs). At the three-month mark, they observed a statistically significant increase in the patients' quality of life, but this improvement did not last at the 12-month mark.107 Administration of ADMSCs did not result in significant benefits and was associated with some ocular complications such as choroidal neovascular membrane and epiretinal membrane.108 Additionally, a preliminary study investigating intravitreal administration of autologous bone marrow CD34+ cells demonstrated short-term safety, but its efficacy remains inconclusive.109 Aekkachai et al. reported improvements in BCVA after intravitreal injection of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in participants with advanced RP, although the effects returned to baseline at 12 months.110 Another study reported infusion of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) through the dorsal hand vein resulted in maintained or improved visual acuity for 81.3% of RP patients for 12 months.111 A prospective phase-III clinical study evaluating the efficacy of subtenon space transplantation of Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) enrolled 34 eyes from 32 RP patients. The study showed improvements in mean outer retinal thickness, horizontal ellipsoid zone width, and BCVA after 6 months, which remained stable at 1-year follow-up.112 Ongoing research is investigating the use of NPC-derived astrocytes (NCT04284293) and NPC-derived RPE (NCT03073733 and NCT02320812) for the treatment of RP.100",
        "Despite promising results, one limitation of these studies is the challenge of obtaining sufficient human fetal retina donor tissue to treat large clinical populations.",
        "DR, a common complication of diabetes, is the main factor contributing to avoidable blindness in people in their working years.113 DR is classified as either proliferative or non-proliferative based on its stage of development.114 During the early non-proliferative stage, hyperglycemia damages the blood-retinal barrier, resulting in blood leakage. These changes initiate ischemic alterations in the surrounding retina. With the progression of hypoperfusion in the retinal capillary bed, proliferative diabetic retinopathy occurs. This condition is regarded as an ineffective response to ischemia, characterized by the development of new vessels at the papilla, on the retina, and the iris.114 Eventually, the proliferation of new vessels induced by localized retinal ischemia can result in tractional retinal detachment and subsequent vision loss.",
        "In a pilot clinical trial, researchers evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous ABMSCs.115 A total of 17 patients with either non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) contributed 34 analyzed eyes. Throughout the 6-month follow-up period, there were no instances of severe complications. Additionally, the NPDR group exhibited reductions in macular thickness and a notable improvement in baseline BCVA, whereas the PDR group did not demonstrate such changes. ABMSCs may provide a secure and efficient therapeutic alternative for DR, with the optimal therapeutic window appearing to be during the NPDR.",
        "Glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease that causes a gradual loss of RGC. Although lowering IOP is the standard therapy for glaucoma, some individuals may not obtain adequate outcomes with maximum dose.",
        "One proposed method of glaucoma stem cell treatment is the secretion of neuro-trophic factors by stem cells, which can promote the survival of RGC in animal models.116, 117, 118 Furthermore, stem cells are being studied as a potential source of replacement for the injured RGC.119 Although several studies suggested safety and potential utility of MSC transplantation,117,120 further clinical trials are still needed to demonstrate visual function improvement of this advanced therapy. There is a distinct obstacle existing compared to RPE and photoreceptor cell replacement: in order for the transplants or replacements to be successful, the transplanted cell must not only integrate into the ganglion cell layer, but also differentiate into RGC-like cells and generate axons from the cell to the optic nerve. Although it does not apply to iPSC, it has been shown that RGC-like cells derived from ESC and MSC can migrate and integrate into the retina.",
        "The stem cell based cell therapy has been clinically applied in the ophthalmology practice for nearly 20 years. However, there are still many challenges in clinical applications. Firstly, almost all of the aforementioned clinical trials have limited serious complications. However, it is important to note that the use of stem cells cannot be considered completely safe. A major adverse event in the United States involving intravitreal stem cell injections has sparked widespread discussion. At a stem cell facility, three patients experienced severe vision impairment after bilateral intravitreal injections of autologous ADMSCs.121 This incident underscores the urgent need for comprehensive regulatory oversight of stem cell therapies studied at research facilities for medical conditions. To address this, new legislation must be enacted to establish rules, prohibit for-profit human research, and ensure patient safety. Moreover, regardless of whether autologous or allogeneic stem cells are used, a crucial prerequisite for mass-producing stem cells is establishing quality design principles and implementing automated and controllable systems. These measures can enhance the repeatability and consistency of cell product manufacturing, leading to cost and risk reduction. Before being used in functional studies on animals or humans, tests are necessary to verify the purity and efficacy of the stem cells. Secondly, stem cell products readily induce immune responses after injection. Therefore, stem cells should be designed with immune evasion characteristics. For example, stem cells that have MHC genes knocked out and overexpress anti-phagocytic molecules are undetectable by MHC-mismatched hosts. However, evading immune regulation can increase the risk of tumor development. One possible solution to avoid uncontrolled proliferation is the addition of suicide genes. In addition, most advanced degenerative ophthalmopathy will experience multiple types of cell loss so the effectiveness of single cell type transplantation is limited. A potential solution to this challenge is multicellular transplantation. Organoid, a remarkable innovation, is a three-dimensional self-organizing structure derived from adult tissue stem cells or pluripotent stem cells. It possesses the ability to simulate the functions and structures of the original tissue and has been utilized in treating neurodegenerative disorders. For eyes, it has been reported that organoid is used to treat photoreceptor degenerative diseases through replacing damaged or lost photoreceptors by forming mature cones and rods.122",
        "This paper proposes several potential directions for future research:",
        "Optimize stem cell sourcing and differentiation: investigate additional sources of autologous or homologous stem cells, enhance the efficiency and quality of stem cell differentiation, and mitigate immune and tumor risks associated with allogenic stem cells.",
        "Improve stem cell delivery and integration: explore biocompatible and biodegradable carrier materials, enhance the survival rate and accuracy of stem cell placement, and facilitate the integration and functional recovery of stem cells with host tissue.",
        "Improve the timing and dosage of stem cell therapy: determine optimal timing and dosage for treating various ophthalmic diseases with stem cells, strike a balance between efficacy and safety, and prevent adverse consequences of over- or underuse of stem cell therapy.",
        "Enhance the evaluation and monitoring of stem cell therapy: investigate objective and sensitive evaluation indicators for stem cell therapy, establish a long-term follow-up and monitoring system for stem cell treatment, and promptly identify and manage complications and failures associated with stem cell therapy.",
        "Improve the norms and regulations of stem cell therapy: establish robust norms and regulations for stem cell therapy, ensure the quality and safety of such therapy, prevent its abuse and misuse, and safeguard the rights and interests of patients.",
        "MSC therapy, particularly its ability to enhance M2 microglial polarization, has demonstrated the release of anti-inflammatory factors that alleviate inflammation and improve neuronal cell conditions. This approach has been successful in treating various neurological disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and spinal cord damage. Therefore, M2 microglial transplantation holds potential as an efficient and suitable treatment option for degenerative eye diseases, given its viability and benefits demonstrated in brain research.",
        "As an innovative solution, stem cell therapy is anticipated to substitute for traditional approaches to treat serious ocular injuries and diseases. Significant efforts have been devoted to investigating promising types of stem cells, such as LSCs and iPSCs, to tackle a broad range of eye diseases. Owing to their distinctive properties, these stem cells demonstrate potential for use in various clinical contexts. Presumably, novel stem cell therapies will be introduced in clinical practice in the near future, offering not only facilitation of tissue regeneration but also attenuation of inflammation and neuroprotective effects through the secretion of exosomes, enhancing patient outcomes. This highlights the multi-mechanistic therapeutic potential of stem cell therapy and will represent a new phase in ocular medicine.",

        "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major global health issue, as it is the most prevalent form of primary liver cancer and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths around the world (1). The incidence of HCC varies by region, with China and East Africa reporting the highest rates, primarily due to widespread infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (2). Recently, the global burden of HCC has grown due to an increase in metabolic disorders. Among these metabolic disorders, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is increasingly recognized as a significant risk factor for the development of HCC (3, 4). The pathogenesis of HCC is multifactorial, with chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and environmental factors such as aflatoxin exposure significantly contributing to its development (5–7).",
        "Surgical approaches, including surgical resection, liver transplantation, and locoregional therapies, represent the only efficacious treatments for early-stage HCC. However, these treatments are only applicable to a small percentage of patients. For patients with advanced disease or underlying liver dysfunction, surgical options are often not viable treatment alternatives. Moreover, systemic therapies, such as chemotherapy, have primarily proven ineffective in treating HCC. HCC is characterized by its notable resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents (8). This underscores the urgent need for new treatment strategies to tackle the challenges of HCC. Based on in-depth research into the immune mechanisms of HCC, cell therapy has emerged as a promising alternative to treating this disease. Cell therapies use living cells to treat or prevent diseases and encompass various approaches, including stem cells, immune cells, and genetically modified cells (9).",
        "Recent advancements in the field have highlighted the ability of specific therapies to more effectively target tumor cells and modify the tumor microenvironment, which can enhance the overall therapeutic response (10, 11). Immune cell-based therapies, particularly CAR T-cell therapy, have shown significant promise in treating hematological malignancies. They are currently being explored for their effectiveness against solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (12–19). This review aims to provide an overview of the latest insights into cellular therapies for managing HCC. By synthesizing recent findings and ongoing research efforts, we seek to clarify how cellular therapies could potentially revolutionize the treatment landscape for HCC and lead to improved patient outcomes. The following sections will examine various facets of cellular therapy, including its mechanisms of action and clinical implications in treating HCC.",
        "Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell(CAR-T) therapy is designed to quickly integrate specific chimeric antigen receptors into T lymphocytes, enhancing their ability to recognize and destroy cancer cells (20, 21). A chimeric antigen receptor typically consists of two main components: an antigen-binding domain derived from a monoclonal antibody targeting tumor-associated antigens and a signaling domain that triggers T-cell activation. This structure allows CAR-T cells to identify specific antigens found on tumor cells, resulting in their swift activation and proliferation, significantly boosting their effectiveness against tumors (22–24).",
        "The effectiveness of CAR-T cell therapy relies on accurately targeting specific proteins highly expressed on tumor surfaces. Glypican 3 (GPC3) is one such protein found at elevated levels in more than 70% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases, while it is nearly absent in normal tissues (25, 26). This heightened expression of GPC3 is also significantly linked to poorer prognoses for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (27, 28). Studies using animal models have confirmed the efficacy of GPC3-CAR-T cells, with initial findings indicating that these cells have promising safety profiles and effectiveness in patients with GPC3-positive relapsed or refractory conditions (29–31). To improve the ability of CAR-T cells to infiltrate tumor environments, researchers have modified GPC3-CAR-T cells to express interleukin 7 (IL-7) and chemokine CCL19, resulting in positive outcomes in experimental studies (32). Another research on Interleukin-15-armored GPC3-CAR T cells for solid tumors, including liver cancer, showed that IL15 increases the expansion, intratumoral survival, and antitumor activity of GPC3-CAR-T cells in patients (33). Several studies have indicated that GPC3-targeted CAR-T cells that overexpress GLUT1 or AGK demonstrate improved CD8 T-cell persistence in vivo and greater antitumor effects in HCC (34). Additionally, GPC3-specific CAR-T cells engineered with IL-21 and CXCL9, combined with PD-1 blockade, have enhanced cytotoxic capabilities against hepatocellular carcinoma (35).",
        "A significant number of liver cancer cases show increased levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood, as this protein is released into the bloodstream. Consequently, several research teams have developed TCR-T cells designed to specifically target AFP (36, 37). Furthermore, early clinical trials have indicated that CAR-T cells targeting c-Met, NKG2D, CD133, and CEA have shown encouraging antitumor effects along with a satisfactory safety profile (12, 38–44).",
        "CAR-T cells face two main challenges as they travel to and infiltrate tumor sites. The first challenge is the lack of essential chemokine receptors on T cells, which limits their ability to interact with chemokines released by tumor cells. This deficiency makes it difficult for CAR-T cells to reach the intended tumor location (45, 46). In the case of hepatocellular carcinoma, the situation is further complicated by a dense fibrotic matrix that reduces the expression of chemokines, significantly hindering the migration and infiltration of CAR-T cells into the tumor (47). Once these cells manage to enter the tumor, they encounter additional obstacles within the harsh tumor microenvironment (TME), which is marked by low oxygen levels and a lack of nutrients (48). Moreover, the TME in HCC is filled with various immunosuppressive cell types, such as regulatory T cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and fibroblasts. These cells can weaken the effectiveness of T-cell responses by releasing immunosuppressive factors and activating immune checkpoints (49).",
        "Nonetheless, this therapeutic approach encounters several challenges, particularly notable adverse reactions like cytokine release syndrome (CRS), off-target toxicity, and neurotoxicity. These complications necessitate careful monitoring and management of patients (50, 51). Current research efforts are aimed at improving the durability and effectiveness of CAR-T cells while also expanding the therapeutic applications of CAR technology to include solid tumors, which have demonstrated higher resistance to this treatment strategy (52–55).",
        "In the study of hepatocellular carcinoma, natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in suppressing tumors by effectively identifying and targeting cancerous cells. The interactions among these cells are complex and can vary significantly. Under normal physiological conditions, NK cells are highly capable of detecting and eliminating HCC cells (56). This recognition process involves various receptors, including NKG2D, NKp30, and NKp46, which bind to specific ligands found on tumor cells, such as MICA/B and ULBP (57). However, HCC tumor cells frequently downregulate the expression of these ligands as a strategy to evade immune detection, which diminishes the ability of NK cells to recognize and attack them (58). Research has demonstrated a direct correlation between the levels of NKG2D ligands on HCC cells and the cytotoxic activity of NK cells. Importantly, activating NKG2D has been shown to enhance the cytotoxic effects of NK cells against HCC (58). Furthermore, when NK cells are activated, they boost the overall immune response to tumors by producing cytokines like interferon-γ, which further supports anti-tumor activities (59).",
        "The tumor microenvironment associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) plays a crucial role in affecting the functionality of natural killer (NK) cells, primarily through immunosuppressive mechanisms and metabolic dysregulation (60, 61). Low oxygen levels mark this microenvironment, the presence of immunosuppressive cells like regulatory T cells and hepatic stellate cells, and the secretion of tumor-associated cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Together, these factors lead to a reduction in NK cell activity (62, 63). For instance, elevated levels of IL-6 have been found to hinder NK cell function, resulting in decreased cytotoxic abilities and reduced cytokine production (62). Moreover, the secretion of soluble programmed death ligand-1 (sPD-L1) by HCC cells significantly contributes to the suppression of NK cell activity, causing NK cell exhaustion and a subsequent drop in their effectiveness (64, 65). Therefore, it is essential to either mitigate the immunosuppressive conditions within HCC or restore NK cell functionality to improve the outcomes of HCC therapies (59, 66).",
        "Autologous natural killer cell therapy has significantly progressed in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (67). Numerous studies have shown that autologous natural killer cells can effectively recognize and eliminate tumor cells. However, the effectiveness of NK cells is often reduced in patients with HCC. Consequently, enhancing the activity of these cells has become a vital approach in HCC treatment. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that expanding and activating autologous NK cells in vitro, especially when combined with cytokines like interleukin-15 (IL-15), significantly boosts their anti-tumor effectiveness (68). For instance, one study found that IL-2-activated autologous NK cells exhibited promising anti-tumor effects in a mouse model, which was also reflected in clinical responses from patients (69). Furthermore, research has highlighted a connection between NK cell functionality and the liver microenvironment, revealing that certain factors within this environment can promote NK cell growth and activation, thereby enhancing their ability to combat tumors (70).",
        "Allogeneic natural killer cell therapy is emerging as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy, showing positive results in various clinical studies (71). Unlike autologous NK cells, which require time-consuming processes for cell expansion and activation within the patient, allogeneic NK cells can be obtained “off the shelf,” allowing for a quicker start to treatment. Research has shown that allogeneic NK cells sourced from healthy donors can effectively control the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with clinical trials reporting fewer side effects (69). For instance, a clinical trial involving patients with advanced HCC found that combining allogeneic NK cells with other immunotherapeutic approaches improved safety and increased effectiveness, leading to significantly better survival rates for patients (72). Additionally, there is ongoing research into chimeric antigen receptor-NK (CAR-NK) cells, with early results suggesting that these cells can specifically target tumor cells and enhance the anti-tumor response, opening up new possibilities for treating HCC (17, 22, 73, 74).",
        "The tumor microenvironment poses significant challenges for therapies that utilize natural killer cells, creating hurdles for cancer immunotherapy. This environment is often marked by high levels of inhibitory cytokines, the presence of immunosuppressive cells, and hypoxic conditions, all of which severely limit the effectiveness and lifespan of NK cells. For instance, tumor cells can release inhibitory substances such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), which hinder the activity and proliferation of NK cells (75). Additionally, the low oxygen levels typical of the tumor microenvironment negatively impact NK cell functions, making it difficult to accurately recognize and destroy tumor cells (76). In response to these challenges, recent advancements in NK cell-based therapies have led researchers to develop various combination treatment strategies specifically for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One promising approach is the combination of NK cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which have shown significant effectiveness in treating HCC. These immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, enhance NK cells’ cytotoxic capabilities and cytokine production (76). Moreover, using these therapies together effectively counters the immune evasion strategies employed by liver cancer, promoting better tumor infiltration and activation of NK cells (59). The interaction between natural killer cells, targeted therapies, and the combination of NK cells with chemotherapy has garnered significant attention in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Targeted therapeutic agents inhibit tumor cell growth directly and enhance anti-tumor responses by activating NK cell cytotoxicity (77). Additionally, these agents can help overcome drug resistance associated with targeted therapies (78). Chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel and cisplatin can increase the expression of ligands for NK cell-activating receptors on the surface of tumor cells. This elevation improves the ability of NK cells to recognize and eliminate tumor cells effectively (79, 80).",
        "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are lymphocytes that infiltrate into tumor tissues, primarily T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, etc. These lymphocytes play a crucial role in immune surveillance and have anti-tumor effects within the tumor microenvironment (81, 82). They can recognize and attack cancerous cells, which has been linked to better overall survival rates (83, 84).",
        "The process of isolating and expanding TILs is essential for their clinical application. Typically, TILs are collected from tumor tissue and then expanded in vitro (85). Modern techniques use specialized culture media and cytokines, particularly interleukin-2 (IL-2), to enhance TIL growth and improve functional abilities (86). Additionally, researchers are exploring more effective methods for cell separation, such as flow cytometry and magnetic bead sorting technology, to increase TIL’s purity and yield (87). These advancements improve the efficiency of TIL amplification and enhance their ability to kill tumor cells, laying a strong foundation for future immunotherapy applications. In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the TIL subpopulations most commonly studied include Foxp3+, CD8+, and CD4+ T cells, as well as B lymphocytes, NK cells, and macrophages, all of which are associated with prognostic outcomes. These advancements improve the efficiency of TIL amplification and enhance their ability to kill tumor cells, laying a strong foundation for future immunotherapy applications. In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the TIL subpopulations most commonly studied include Foxp3+, CD8+, and CD4+ T cells, as well as B lymphocytes, NK cells, and macrophages, all of which are associated with prognostic outcomes (88–91). Previous clinical trials have shown that administering TILs can significantly enhance patient survival rates after HCC hepatectomy (92, 93).",
        "Future investigations should focus on integrating TILs with various immunotherapeutic strategies to improve treatment effectiveness. For instance, using anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies together with TILs has shown promising results (94). Studies suggest that agonists targeting co-stimulatory receptors, like GITR, may enhance the functionality of TILs. When these agents are used alongside PD-1 inhibitors, they could create a synergistic effect (95). TILs can serve as a standalone treatment option and work effectively in combination with other immunotherapeutic approaches, ultimately leading to better response rates and extended survival for patients with HCC.",
        "Applying single-cell RNA sequencing technology offers a deep insight into the complex diversity found within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This understanding allows for the precise tailoring of immunotherapy, ensuring that each patient receives a treatment plan that aligns with their specific immune profile (96). Furthermore, incorporating key biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression levels and the extent of TIL infiltration, provides a dependable way to evaluate how well patients might respond to immunotherapy. This approach has opened doors to innovative personalized treatment strategies (97). By focusing on the unique characteristics of each patient, these tailored treatment plans not only improve the effectiveness of therapies but also minimize the risk of unnecessary side effects, significantly enhancing the overall quality of life for patients (98).",
        "Stem cell therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma focuses on three main aspects. First, it utilizes the regenerative capabilities of stem cells to help repair liver tissue. These stem cells can transform into hepatocytes, effectively replacing damaged cells and restoring liver function. Second, the therapy takes advantage of the immunomodulatory effects of stem cells to improve the tumor microenvironment. Stem cells can release various cytokines and bioactive molecules that influence the behavior of immune cells within the tumor area, reducing the immunosuppressive conditions and enhancing the body’s anti-tumor immune response. Finally, genetically modified stem cells are engineered to specifically target cancerous cells, which helps to limit tumor growth. These altered stem cells can be designed to recognize tumor cells, deliver anti-cancer agents, and induce programmed cell death in malignant cells, thereby preventing tumors’ growth and spread (99–102).",
        "Numerous investigations have explored the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in treating hepatocellular carcinoma. MSCs are recognized for their significant capabilities in tissue repair, and research indicates that they can enhance HCC outcomes by reducing tumor-related inflammation and promoting liver regeneration (103). For instance, in an animal study, administering MSCs derived from bone marrow led to decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins (IL-2, IL-10), which markedly improved liver function in rats modeling HCC and facilitated liver regeneration (104). Furthermore, MSCs have been shown to reduce tumor-associated immunosuppression by inhibiting T cells’ activation and proliferation while promoting the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), thereby enhancing immune tolerance and inhibiting tumor progression (103). These immunomodulatory properties of MSCs make stem cell therapy a promising strategy for HCC treatment. On the other hand, cancer stem cells (CSCs) in liver cancer possess a strong capacity for self-renewal, diverse differentiation potential, and the ability to initiate tumors. These cells play a crucial role in tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance, making them pivotal in the recurrence and metastasis of HCC (105). Studies have shown that a combination of 5-fluorouracil and a CD13 inhibitor can effectively suppress the proliferation of LCSCs and reduce tumor burden (106).",
        "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are created by reprogramming somatic cells to express specific transcription factors, resulting in cells that can differentiate into any cell type, similar to embryonic stem cells. One of the main advantages of iPSCs is that they can be derived from various cell types, which minimizes ethical concerns. This feature allows researchers to isolate iPSCs from cells obtained from patients, paving the way for personalized treatment options. In the study of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), iPSCs are particularly useful as they provide models to explore the mechanisms of cancer development and to evaluate how liver cancer responds to different drugs (103). Furthermore, researchers can guide iPSCs to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells using specific induction techniques, offering new strategies for treating HCC (107). Additionally, adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) hold considerable promise for HCC treatment, as they can promote liver tissue regeneration and repair by releasing various bioactive factors (103).",
        "Engineered T cell therapy, specifically T cell receptor (TCR) therapy, is an innovative approach in cellular immunotherapy designed to reprogram patients’ T cells to target and destroy tumor cells. This strategy relies on the ability of TCRs to recognize tumor-specific antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which activate the T cell-mediated immune response against tumors. TCR-T cells can identify unique antigens found on the surfaces of tumor cells, triggering a cytotoxic response that leads to eliminating these cancerous cells. Research has shown that TCR-T cell therapy is promising in clinical applications for various solid tumors, particularly highlighting its potential effectiveness in treating resistant tumors like hepatocellular carcinoma (108, 109).",
        "Recent advancements have been made in studying hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific T cell receptor redirected T (HBV-TCR-T) cells, particularly in HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. In a clinical trial, one participant who received HBV-TCR-T cell therapy achieved a partial remission of 27.7 months. Moreover, most patients showed a significant decrease in both HBsAg and HBV DNA levels following treatment, highlighting the targeted effectiveness of this therapeutic strategy (110). Another clinical study, identified by clinical trial number NCT05339321, demonstrated the ability of genetically modified T cells to specifically target hepatocytes that express hepatitis B surface antigen and those involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (111). Additionally, a different clinical investigation (NCT02719782) emphasized the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of mRNA electroporated HBV-specific TCR-T cells (112). A significant challenge related to this therapeutic approach is the limited specificity that comes with T cell receptor (TCR) recognition. Most TCRs are designed to target specific antigenic epitopes, which limits their ability to recognize a broader range of targets. For example, TCRs developed to target hepatocellular carcinoma may not effectively recognize all tumor cells, especially when there are variations in the antigens present on the tumor cells.",
        "Therapeutic strategies that combine different treatment modalities, especially those involving T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells, show significant promise in managing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Integrating cytokines like interleukin-21 (IL-21) with TCR-T cell therapy can significantly enhance anti-tumor responses. IL-21 promotes the growth of TCR-T cells and supports their development into memory T cells, which boosts their effectiveness against tumors. Furthermore, IL-21 is crucial in reducing the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), which helps decrease cell death and strengthens the anti-tumor capabilities of TCR-T cells (113). Additionally, combining TCR-T cells with small molecule agents, such as Atovaquone, has improved treatment outcomes. Atovaquone increases the cytotoxic effects of TCR-T cells by triggering ferroptosis, which further hinders the progression of HCC (114). By enhancing the effectiveness of each therapeutic approach and reducing the chances of resistance, these combination therapy strategies pave the way for a more personalized and targeted treatment approach for HCC.",
        "CRISPR/Cas9 technology for editing T-cell receptors (TCRs) allows for more precisely introducing these receptors into T cells. This accuracy ensures that TCRs are consistently expressed in T lymphocytes, which enhances their ability to fight tumors in living organisms (115). Simultaneously, the development of TCR-engineered T cells aimed at specific antigens, like glypican-3 (GPC3) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), has demonstrated promising safety and effectiveness in clinical trials (116).",
        "Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells represent an ex vivo-expanded heterogeneous immunocyte subset, mainly consisting of CD3+ and CD56+ T lymphocytes with dual T-cell and natural killer (NK)—like phenotypic characteristics (117). The expansion of CIK cells in the lab involves a specific sequence of cytokine treatments. First, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is used to activate antigen-presenting cells. After this initial step, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies and interleukin-2 (IL-2) are introduced at specific times to promote the growth and development of these cells. The combined effects of these cytokines allow CIK cells to participate in adaptive and innate immune responses through two main ways of attacking. The first way involves recognizing antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules through T-cell receptors (TCRs). The second way allows CIK cells to use a receptor called NKG2D to detect stress-induced ligands like MIC-A/B and ULBP1-4, which means they can act without relying on MHC. This approach combines the activation of cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-γ) with the stimulation of anti-CD3 antibodies to create effector cells that are highly effective in killing cancer cells through perforin/granzyme pathways and producing Th1-type cytokines. As a result, CIK cells show enhanced abilities to recognize tumors compared to traditional lymphocyte therapies (118, 119).",
        "CIK cells have become a significant focus in the field of immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical trials have highlighted the potential of CIK cells to enhance anti-tumor responses in patients with HCC. Clinical trials have highlighted the potential of CIK cells to enhance anti-tumor responses in patients with HCC. For example, a notable study involving 264 participants found that patients receiving CIK cell therapy, whether as a standalone treatment or alongside surgical procedures or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), showed significantly improved overall survival (OS) compared to those undergoing standard therapies alone. The Kaplan-Meier analysis further revealed that patients who received both surgery and CIK therapy had better OS rates than those who only had surgery, with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001). Additionally, incorporating CIK therapy into TACE regimens enhanced both OS and progression-free survival (PFS) (120). Another study demonstrated that CIK cells derived from HCC patients exhibited substantial cytotoxicity against various tumor cell lines, highlighting their effectiveness in targeting HCC cells (121). A comprehensive meta-analysis that combined results from multiple studies confirmed that CIK therapy significantly improves OS and reduces recurrence rates among HCC patients, reinforcing the therapeutic potential of CIK cells in clinical settings (122). Furthermore, the effectiveness of CIK therapy is linked to its ability to trigger a robust immune response. For instance, one study showed that CIK cells have high levels of activating receptors and low levels of immune checkpoint molecules, indicating their readiness to engage in anti-tumor activities (123).",
        "The combination of cytokine-induced killer cell therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown promising results in treating hepatocellular carcinoma. Studies suggest that some patients who received CIK therapy before anti-PD-1 antibody treatment experienced complete responses, indicating a potential synergistic effect between these two treatment strategies (124). This synergy is thought to arise from the ability of CIK cells to enhance tumor-specific immune responses. In contrast, immune checkpoint inhibitors work to reduce the inhibitory signals that dampen T-cell activity in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, a new strategy involves administering CIK cells with dendritic cells (DCs), leading to a DC-CIK combination therapy. This approach has been associated with increased immune activation and better anti-tumor responses in various cancers, including HCC (125, 126). In this context, DCs serve as powerful antigen-presenting cells that can further stimulate the growth and activation of CIK cells, thereby boosting their ability to effectively target and destroy HCC cells.",
        "Novel methodologies, such as gas-permeable culture systems, have significantly enhanced the efficiency of cytokine-induced killer cell expansion while preserving their functional characteristics. A comparative analysis between traditional culture techniques and gas-permeable systems showed that CIK cells grown in these advanced systems exhibited improved proliferation rates and retained their ability to target myeloid leukemia cell lines effectively. This finding underscores these cells’ potential for large-scale clinical production (127). Incorporating various cytokines and growth factors into the culture media has also been explored to enhance the functional properties of CIK cells. For instance, adding N-acetylcysteine (NAC) during the culture process has been shown to significantly increase the cytotoxicity of CIK cells against cancer cell lines by promoting their proliferation and enhancing cytokine production (128).",
        "DC-CIK cell therapy, which combines dendritic cells (DCs) with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), supported by an increasing amount of clinical evidence demonstrating its effectiveness in improving patient survival and overall quality of life. A meta-analysis involving 3,756 HCC patients revealed that adding DC-CIK therapy to standard treatment methods, such as surgical resection or locoregional therapies, significantly enhances overall survival (OS) rates compared to conventional treatment alone (129). Notably, DC-CIK therapy has been found to substantially reduce recurrence rates, especially in patients who have undergone curative procedures like hepatectomy or liver transplantation. Clinical trials have shown a 32% reduction in early postoperative recurrence (within two years) when DC-CIK therapy is used as an adjunctive treatment (130). Additionally, recent multicenter studies in Eastern China have reinforced these findings, highlighting the increased antitumor effectiveness of DC-CIK therapy when combined with multimodal approaches such as microwave ablation, chemotherapy, or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). For instance, a phase II clinical trial indicated that the combination of DC-CIK and TACE led to a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 14.6 months, compared to 9.8 months for TACE alone (HR=0.62; P<0.01) (131). Mechanistically, DC-CIK therapy improves the presentation of tumor antigens by DCs while simultaneously activating CIK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against HCC cells that lack MHC class I, thus overcoming significant challenges associated with traditional immunotherapy methods.",
        "The combination of dendritic cell-cytokine-induced killer (DC-CIK) cell therapy with targeted agents has shown impressive synergistic effects in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Research indicates that immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially those targeting PD-1 like pembrolizumab, significantly boost the cytotoxic effectiveness of DC-CIK cells by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. This blockage helps reverse T-cell exhaustion and enhances the tumor-killing activity of DC-CIK cells, which is linked to better patient survival rates (132). Moreover, immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration in tumors following combination therapy, indicating a heightened immune response (129). Simultaneously using DC-CIK and targeted therapies positively impacts the tumor microenvironment (TME). Targeted therapies can modify the TME, creating a more supportive environment for immune cell infiltration and function, thereby increasing the therapeutic effects of DC-CIK cells. Evidence shows that targeted therapies significantly improve the growth and cytotoxic abilities of DC-CIK cells in patients (130). A systematic review and meta-analysis have highlighted that DC-CIK immunotherapy has considerable potential for enhancing survival and response rates in cases of solid tumors (133).",
        "Natural killer T (NKT) cells represent a unique subset of T lymphocytes characterized by co-expression of T-cell receptors and natural killer cell markers (134). Although they originate from the T-cell lineage, NKT cells exhibit both morphological and functional similarities to NK cells. They play a crucial role in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses by quickly releasing cytokines, essential during the early stages of immune reactions (135).",
        "The invariant NKT (iNKT) cell subset, a predominant subtype of NKT cells, develops from CD4+ and CD8+ double-positive thymocytes (136). These cells are notable for their invariant TCR chain, which explicitly recognizes lipid antigens presented by CD1d molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (137). Upon activation by α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), a synthetic glycolipid antigen loaded onto CD1d, iNKT cells exhibit dual effector functions: 1) rapid secretion of both Th1-type (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α) and Th2-type (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) cytokines (138); 2) direct cytotoxic activity against tumor cells via perforin/granzyme pathways (139). Furthermore, activated iNKT cells enhance antitumor immunity by facilitating interactions with NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) through CD40L-CD40 signaling and cytokine networks, thereby strengthening immune responses across various compartments (140).",
        "Numerous clinical investigations are currently underway to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of various treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One notable study is a phase I clinical trial (NCT03175679) conducted at Beijing YouAn Hospital, which enrolled ten patients diagnosed with HCC at stages B/C according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification. In this trial, researchers isolated autologous invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells from the patient’s peripheral blood mononuclear cells, expanded them, and pulsed them with α-GalCer before infusion. The trial results indicated that the administration of expanded iNKT cells was safe and well-tolerated, with most treatment-related adverse events classified as grade 1-2. Preliminary findings suggested that the infused iNKT cells triggered significant T-helper 1-like immune responses, potentially contributing to antitumor activity. Additionally, assessments conducted after infusion showed increased levels of circulating iNKT cells and activated natural killer (NK) cells among the patients, indicating a likely enhancement of antitumor immune responses (141). Furthermore, a phase II randomized controlled trial explored the effects of iNKT cell infusion combined with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) in patients with unresectable HCC who had previously failed TACE. This combined approach significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to TAE alone, highlighting the promising role of iNKT cell therapy in managing HCC (142). These findings are further supported by additional studies that underscore the antitumor efficacy of iNKT cells across various malignancies, including gastric cancer and neuroblastoma, where iNKT cell-based therapies have shown potential in improving clinical outcomes and patient survival rates (143, 144). In conclusion, the growing body of evidence indicates that iNKT cell therapy is safe and effective. This highlights the urgent need for more extensive multicenter trials to confirm these findings across various patient demographics and cancer types.",
        "Expanded Activated Lymphocyte (EAL) cell therapy involves extracting and enhancing lymphocytes from a patient’s own body using specialized techniques. These lymphocytes, primarily T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, are then expanded and activated in a laboratory setting before being reinfused into the patient to boost their ability to fight tumors. Both T cells and NK cells play essential roles in immune surveillance (145). Research indicates that EAL cells can recognize tumor-specific antigens and trigger tumor cell death through cytotoxic mechanisms. Additionally, they can modulate the activity of other immune cells by releasing cytokines, thereby creating a robust anti-tumor immune network (146). The proliferation of T and B lymphocytes, along with the presence of cytokines, has shown encouraging results in combating various tumors (147, 148).",
        "One significant study highlighted a Phase I clinical trial that used autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, providing initial evidence for the feasibility of this immunotherapeutic approach in treating this type of cancer (92). Furthermore, a multicenter, randomized, open-label pivotal Phase II study (NCT05213637) evaluated the effectiveness and safety of EAL therapy in preventing recurrence in patients with primary HCC who are at high risk for recurrence after radical resections.",
        "Macrophages possess unique characteristics that make them well-suited for CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) engineering. These cells are highly adaptable, allowing them to polarize into different functional states, such as M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotypes. This adaptability enables macrophages to respond to the changing conditions within the tumor microenvironment effectively. As a result, CAR-engineered macrophages (CAR-Ms) can directly attack tumor cells through processes like phagocytosis, while modulating the immune response by influencing the activities of other immune cells (149, 150). CAR-M engineering equips them with remarkable antigen recognition and targeting capabilities. They are specifically designed to identify tumor-associated antigens accurately. For instance, CAR-Ms targeting Glypican-3 (GPC3) are adept at recognizing and eliminating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells due to their antigen-specific recognition domains on the cell surface (151). Beyond targeting surface antigens, CAR-Ms can also recognize additional markers, such as fibroblast activation protein (FAP), present in the tumor microenvironment. This diverse targeting ability significantly enhances the effectiveness of immune surveillance and the clearance of tumor cells (152). CAR-Ms play a crucial role in the secretion of cytokines and the modulation of the immune response. Research shows that these engineered macrophages produce a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-12 (IL-12), which are essential for generating a strong anti-tumor immune response (149, 153). Additionally, CAR-Ms enhance anti-tumor immunity by influencing the activity of other immune cells; for example, they can promote T-cell activation and proliferation through the release of cytokines, leading to a more vigorous immune response (154). Furthermore, CAR-Ms impact the immune environment within the tumor microenvironment by encouraging the polarization of M1 macrophages while suppressing M2 macrophage activity, thereby strengthening anti-tumor effects (155). This inherent ability to modify the tumor microenvironment gives CAR-Ms significant potential for cancer therapy, especially in tackling solid tumors where they can effectively address the immune suppression challenges posed by the tumor microenvironment (156).",
        "Initial findings from clinical trials indicate promising results for using CAR macrophages in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One study that combined GPC3-targeted CAR macrophage cells with sorafenib showed significant anti-tumor activity, particularly in smaller tumors, although the effectiveness decreased in larger tumor masses (151). Overall, this combination therapy was more advantageous for smaller tumors, yet it still demonstrated improved anti-tumor properties. Additionally, CAR macrophages targeting CD147 exhibited encouraging anti-tumor effects in laboratory studies, with early evidence hinting at their potential use in clinical applications (157). In preclinical models of HER2+ solid tumors, which generally show low responsiveness to anti-PD1 (aPD1) monotherapy, CAR macrophages with aPD1 proved exceptionally effective. This approach controls tumor growth, extends survival, and modifies the tumor microenvironment (TME). These findings suggest a synergistic relationship between CAR macrophages and T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, highlighting a potential strategy to enhance the response of tumors that usually do not respond to aPD1 therapy in patients (158).",
        "The utilization of CAR-T/NK/M cell therapies in treating hepatocellular carcinoma faces several challenges, particularly regarding target selection due to the tumor’s heterogeneity and the immunosuppressive characteristics of the tumor microenvironment. Future efforts should focus on improving CAR construct designs, which includes identifying more specific and practical tumor-associated antigens and finding ways to mitigate the immunosuppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment. For instance, combining immune checkpoint inhibitors or other immunomodulatory agents could enhance the effectiveness of CAR-T, NK, and M cell therapies. Gene-editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 may be utilized to modify T, NK, and M cells, potentially increasing their ability to recognize and target specific antigens found in hepatocellular carcinoma (53, 159, 160). Several studies have attempted to engineer CAR-T, NK, and M cells targeting specific antigens in hepatocellular carcinoma, such as glypican-3 (GPC3), showing promising initial results; however, further improvements and optimizations are necessary (30, 151, 161).",
        "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes hold significant potential in cancer immunotherapy, yet their application in hepatocellular carcinoma is still relatively limited. Future research should concentrate on efficiently isolating and expanding TILs from hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and optimizing TIL reinfusion protocols to enhance their therapeutic impact in managing this type of cancer (162). Studies have highlighted the considerable effectiveness of TIL therapy in treating other cancers, like melanoma, providing a helpful reference for its potential use in hepatocellular carcinoma (163).",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess both immunomodulatory properties and the ability to regenerate tissues, making them a promising cellular source for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (164). Research has shown that MSCs can exert anti-tumor effects by regulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting apoptosis in cancerous cells. However, further studies are needed to clarify the therapeutic mechanisms through which MSCs function. Additionally, advancements in MSC-based cell therapy products, such as genetic modifications of MSCs or the incorporation of therapeutic agents, could enhance their anti-tumor effectiveness (165).",
        "Exosomes, nanoscale vesicles secreted by cells, can transport specific proteins from their parent cells and serve as alternatives to immune cells by stimulating the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thus contributing to anti-cancer responses (166, 167). More research is required to understand the mechanisms that govern exosome functionality. It is also crucial to optimize exosome preparation and modification techniques to improve their targeting abilities and therapeutic efficacy in managing hepatocellular carcinoma (168, 169). Furthermore, exosomes can be engineered to specifically target and incorporate antigen fragments associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, potentially boosting their anti-cancer properties (170).",
        "The NIR-II laser activates nanomaterials, such as polymer nanoagonists and immunoprotease nanorestimulators, to create localized hyperthermia, reaching temperatures between 45°C and 50°C. This heat directly destroys tumor cells and initiates a process known as immunogenic cell death (ICD). As a result, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) like ATP, HMGB1, and calreticulin are released, which help mature dendritic cells (DCs) and improve antigen presentation (171). NIR-II photothermal immunotherapy presents a promising and low-toxicity strategy for cancer treatment through four main mechanisms: photothermal ablation, antigen release triggered by ICD, targeted delivery of immunomodulators using activatable nanocarriers, and the combined activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses (172).",
        "The integration of cell therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors represents a promising advancement in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly with the use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, which have shown significant effectiveness (173). However, there is still a pressing need to improve the response rates seen with monotherapy. By combining cell therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, we may achieve synergistic effects; cell therapy can activate the immune system, while immune checkpoint inhibitors can help reduce immunosuppressive mechanisms, ultimately enhancing the anti-tumor immune response (174). Currently, a clinical trial is in progress to assess the effectiveness of CAR-T cell therapy when used alongside PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (175). Additionally, \nTable 1\n provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms, benefits, limitations, and potential future directions for various cell and combination therapies.",
        "Presentation of the mechanisms, advantages, limitations and future development directions of different types of cell therapies and combination therapies.",
        "Combining Cell Therapy with targeted therapeutics has shown promise in enhancing cancer treatment outcomes. Targeted agents like sorafenib and lenvatinib are effective in suppressing tumor cell growth and forming new blood vessels, but a major challenge is the development of drug resistance over time (176). Combining cell therapy with these targeted treatments may create a synergistic effect by utilizing different mechanisms of action, which could help reduce the chances of resistance (177). For example, studies have found that administering CAR-T cell therapy alongside sorafenib leads to better anti-tumor responses in animal models of liver cancer (178).",
        "On the other hand, traditional treatment methods such as surgery, liver transplantation, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy remain vital in managing hepatocellular carcinoma. By integrating cell therapy with these conventional approaches, we can leverage the benefits of both to improve treatment results (179). For instance, using cell therapy as an additional treatment after surgical removal of tumors or liver transplants can help eliminate any remaining cancer cells and lower the risk of the cancer returning (180). Additionally, combining cell therapy with radiotherapy or chemotherapy may enhance the destructive effects on cancer cells while reducing the side effects commonly associated with these traditional treatments (181, 182).",
        "Integrating various cell therapies showcases unique characteristics and benefits of each approach. When multiple cell therapies are combined, they can create a synergistic effect that significantly improves therapeutic outcomes (183). For example, using CAR-T cell therapy alongside cytokine-induced killer cell therapy or tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cell therapy allows for the targeted specificity of engineered cells to work in tandem with the broad-spectrum action of natural immune cells, enhancing the management of tumor growth (184). In previous experiments, a construct known as Ad5f35-anti-GPC3-CAR, which utilized a chimeric adenoviral vector (Ad5f35), demonstrated impressive antigen-specific phagocytosis and tumor cytotoxicity (151).",
        "Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is an important biomarker used to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but some patients with HCC may still test negative for AFP. This highlights the need for alternative biomarkers that provide better sensitivity and specificity. Other potential biomarkers include serum alpha-L-fucosidase (AFU), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase isoenzyme II (γ-GT2), des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), and Golgi protein 73 (GP73), all of which have shown promise in diagnosing and differentiating HCC (185). However, further research is needed to assess their clinical usefulness and the methods for detecting them (186). Additionally, advancements in genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics may lead to the discovery of new biomarkers such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNA (miRNA), and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) (187–189). These emerging biomarkers could provide a more accurate basis for the early diagnosis, evaluation of treatment effectiveness, and prediction of outcomes in HCC. By performing gene sequencing and analyzing biomarkers in HCC patients, researchers can gain insights into their tumors’ molecular features and biological behaviors, which can help develop personalized treatment plans. For patients with specific gene mutations or abnormal biomarker levels, targeted therapies or cellular treatments may improve the effectiveness and safety of their care (190). Furthermore, these biomarkers can be used to monitor how healthy treatments are working and to assess the risk of cancer recurrence, allowing for timely adjustments to treatment strategies (191).",
        "The absence of standardized detection methods and criteria for biomarkers presents significant challenges to the accuracy and reliability of their clinical applications (192). To ensure the precision and comparability of future test results, it is crucial to develop uniform protocols for biomarker detection and establish quality control frameworks. Furthermore, conducting multi-center, large-scale clinical studies is essential to validate these biomarkers’ clinical relevance and potential applications.",
        "Recently, cellular therapies have shown significant promise in managing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), leading to better outcomes for patients. This review focuses on the latest advancements in cellular therapies, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, engineered T cells, and stem cell-based strategies, all of which have yielded encouraging results in preclinical and clinical trials. The treatment landscape for HCC is complex, requiring careful consideration of various factors when incorporating cellular therapies into standard treatment plans. Despite the positive findings, several challenges remain that need further investigation. These challenges include the heterogeneity of HCC, the nature of the tumor microenvironment, and the risk of immune evasion. Moreover, a thorough assessment of the manufacturing processes for cellular products, patient selection criteria, and the long-term safety and effectiveness of these therapies is crucial. It is important to integrate diverse perspectives from various studies to develop a more nuanced understanding of the treatment landscape and avoid overestimating cellular therapies’ effectiveness. Combining cellular therapies with established treatment methods, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, could create synergistic effects that enhance overall treatment effectiveness. This integrative approach can potentially improve response rates in HCC patients, extend survival, and enhance quality of life. As the field progresses, promoting collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies will be essential to tackle the complexities of HCC treatment and to ensure the safe and effective use of cellular therapies. In summary, cellular therapies offer promising possibilities for the future management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but ongoing research and clinical trials are essential to overcome the existing challenges. By fostering a balanced discussion around diverse research findings, we can pave the way for innovative treatment strategies to benefit patients facing this challenging cancer.",

    "title": "Dcaf11 activates Zscan4-mediated alternative telomere lengthening in early embryos and embryonic stem cells. linked with the onset of aging and human disease. Telomeres undergo extensive lengthening during early embryogenesis. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of telomere resetting in early embryos remains unknown. Here, we show that Dcaf11 (Ddb1- and Cul4-associated factor 11) participates in telomere elongation in early embryos and 2-cell-like embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The deletion of Dcaf11 in embryos and ESCs leads to reduced telomere sister-chromatid exchange (T-SCE) and impairs telomere lengthening. Importantly, Dcaf11-deficient mice exhibit gradual telomere erosion with successive generations, and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity is also greatly compromised. Mechanistically, Dcaf11 targets Kap1 (KRAB-associated protein 1) for ubiquitination-mediated degradation, leading to the activation of Zscan4 downstream enhancer and the removal of heterochromatic H3K9me3 at telomere/subtelomere regions. Our study therefore demonstrates that Dcaf11 plays important roles in telomere elongation in early embryos and ESCs through activating Zscan4.

        "USP17L, encoded by a gene family expressed in mouse 2-cell embryos and 2-cell-like cells, is shown to promote the 2-cell program in mESCs at both transcriptional and post-translational levels, in part through deubiquitinating H2AK119ub1 and ZSCAN4.",
        "Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is essential for the maternal-to-zygotic transition and mammalian embryonic development. Prior to major ZGA, when thousands of genes are activated, there is a minor wave of transcription known as minor ZGA1,2. In mouse, minor ZGA occurs from the S phase of the zygote to the 2-cell embryo3, which has been shown to be essential for proper major ZGA occurring at the late 2-cell stage3,4. Dozens of genes are activated during minor ZGA, but their functions are not completely understood. Among them, ZSCAN4 has been shown to enhance the expression of MERVL and a subset of 2-cell specific genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)5, and promote telomere elongation and genome stability6–9. DUX in mice and DUX4 in humans can activate a subset of minor ZGA genes in ESCs10–12, although loss of Dux alone is compatible with mouse ZGA and embryonic development13–15. Recently, OBOX family genes, which include both maternal factors and proteins expressed during minor ZGA, have been reported to be essential for both mouse major and minor ZGA as well as mouse development beyond the 2-cell stage16.",
        "2C-like cells (2CLCs) represent a rare subpopulation (1%–5%) of ESCs that express 2C-specific markers, such as Zscan4 and endogenous retrovirus (MERVL)6,17,18. 2CLCs and early 2-cell embryos share unique characteristics of transcriptomes, chromatin accessibility landscapes, increased global histone mobility, and regulatory networks1,10,17,19–22. In addition, 2CLCs also recapitulate 2-cell embryos in their capacity to contribute to extra-embryonic tissues17. Hence, 2CLCs represent an excellent model for understanding ZGA and totipotency22,23.",
        "The DUB/USP17 family proteins were initially identified in mice as deubiquitination enzymes that are involved in cell growth and viability, DNA damage response, and embryogenesis24–26. Usp17l, which includes Usp17la-e, is a subfamily of Dub/Usp17 residing in a tandemly repeated sequence on chromosome 7 in mice24,27. Notably, Usp17l is highly expressed in minor ZGA28 and in 2CLCs29–32. Its overexpression can improve the efficiency of SCNT33. However, the exact function of Usp17l and its working mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we show that Usp17l plays critical roles in the 2-cell-like state through deubiquitination of H2AK119ub1 to facilitate the expression of Dux, and through deubiquitination and stabilization of ZSCAN4.",
        "Usp17l gene family includes Usp17la (Dub1), Usp17lb (Dub1a), Usp17lc (Dub2), Usp17ld (Dub2a), and Usp17le (Dub3) that share stretches of identical nucleotide sequences in the coding regions (Fig. 1A). As reported28,33, Usp17l genes were activated during minor ZGA (early 2-cell) and the transcripts peaked during major ZGA (late 2-cell) followed by a rapid decline afterward (Fig. 1B, left). Ribo-seq data34 showed they were also actively translated during this period (Fig. 1B, right). As Usp17l was also highly expressed in 2CLCs29, we utilized Zscan4-positive (+) ESCs as a model to study the potential function of Usp17l21,23,35,36. We first sorted Zscan4+ and Zscan4− cells by flow cytometry of tdTomato-ZSCAN4 ESCs (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. 1A). Usp17l was expressed at higher levels in Zscan4+ ESCs than that in Zscan4− cells (Fig. 1D), as reported29. Elevated USP17L protein levels in Zscan4+ ESCs were also confirmed by western blot (Supplementary Fig. 1B) using an antibody that recognizes all family members (“Methods”).Fig. 1Usp17l regulates the 2C program in mouse ESCs.A Schematic depicting the Usp17l family genes based on the nucleotide sequences.

        "To explore the potential functions of Usp17l, we first attempted to knock them down in ESCs. Based on the common region of the five Usp17l subfamily members (Fig. 1A), two shRNAs were designed and transfected into ESCs, from which two stable knockdown cell lines (KD4, KD9) (Fig. 1E, F) were selected for subsequent experiments. We confirmed the substantial downregulation of Usp17l at both the RNA and protein levels (Fig. 1E, F). The Usp17l knockdown ESCs displayed typical ESC morphology (Fig. 1G). Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis revealed that pluripotency genes such as Nanog, Klf2, Tbx3, Dppa3, and Esrrb were upregulated following Usp17l knockdown (Fig. 1H, left). Pou5f1 (also known as Oct4) expression was substantially upregulated in one of the clones (KD4, Fig. 1H, left). Western blot showed the upregulation of both OCT4 and NANOG in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 2A). By contrast, Usp17l knockdown substantially reduced the expression of Dux, Zscan4, and other 2C genes (Fig. 1H, left, and Supplementary Fig. 2B), and the proportion of Zscan4+ cells (Fig. 1I). Transcription of MERVLs and other retrotransposons was also decreased (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Hence, USP17L promotes the activation of 2C genes in ESCs. The upregulation of pluripotency genes upon Usp17l KD was similar to that in Dux KO37 or Zscan4 KD mESCs5. Acquisition of totipotency or expanded developmental potential is often accompanied by downregulation of pluripotency genes for reasons that are not very clear38,39. How USP17L suppresses pluripotency genes in mESCs warrants further investigation.",
        "We then examined whether overexpression of Usp17l can promote the transcription of 2C genes. Intriguingly, overexpression of Usp17le substantially increased the expression of Zscan4 and the proportion of Zscan4+ cells revealed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1J and Supplementary Fig. 2D, E). Zscan4 was only slightly upregulated when other Usp17l members were overexpressed (Supplementary Fig. 2D). The differential activation capacity appeared to correlate with their cellular localization, as immunofluorescent showed that USP17LE was clearly localized in the nucleus, unlike other USP17L members which were present mainly in the cytoplasm and peri-nucleus regions (Supplementary Fig. 2F). Due to the lack of antibodies that can distinguish each family member, we used an anti-Flag antibody to probe Flag-tagged USP17L proteins in ESCs. Although we could not exclude the possibility that this difference may arise from overexpression and may not reflect the properties of endogenous USP17L, we chose to use USP17LE for the majority of overexpression experiments. While pluripotency genes were downregulated, expression of Dux, Zscan4 family, Tcstv1/Tcstv3, and other 2C-genes, as well as the Usp17l family itself, were notably elevated in Usp17le overexpressed ESCs (Fig. 1H, right). Furthermore, MERVL and MT2 were also upregulated by Usp17le overexpression (Fig. 1K), suggesting that USP17L is sufficient to activate the 2C program. Of note, our data show that Esrrb was upregulated upon Usp17l depletion and downregulated upon Usp17le overexpression in mESCs (Fig. 1H). As ESRRB can upregulate Usp17le in coordination with the coactivator NcoA1 in mESCs40,41, these data suggest possible negative regulatory feedback between Esrrb and Usp17le in mESCs.",
        "Consistent with the notion that ZSCAN4 is involved in telomere lengthening6, the relative telomere length estimated by qPCR42 was decreased upon Usp17l knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 2G), as confirmed by telomere quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) (Fig. 1L and Supplementary Fig. 2H)43 and Southern blot (Supplementary Fig. 2I). Such shortening of telomere length is not due to perturbation of the expression of telomere genes, such as Terc and Tert, which were unaffected after Usp17l knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 2J). Along with the shortened telomeres, chromosome breakage was also detected in Usp17l knockdown cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 2H, arrows), suggesting increased genome instability. As immunofluorescence showed no localization of USP17L at telomeres marked by TRF1 (Supplementary Fig. 2K), these data raise a possibility that USP17L may affect telomeres through ZSCAN4. In summary, USP17LE promotes the transcription of 2C genes in ESCs.",
        "We then explored how USP17L regulates 2C genes. As Dux is a major inducer of the 2C state6,17,44–47, we tested whether Dux is involved in the elevated transcription of 2C genes following Usp17le overexpression. Indeed, in Usp17le overexpressed ESCs, Dux knockdown partially reduced the transcription of 2C genes, including Usp17l, Zscan4, Tcstv1, and MERVL (Fig. 2A, B), raising a possibility that Usp17le may promote the transcription of the 2C genes through both DUX dependent and independent pathways. We then asked if the expression of Dux may be regulated by USP17L. Dux was downregulated upon Usp17l knockdown (Fig. 2C) and was upregulated in Usp17le overexpressed cells (Fig. 2D), indicating that Dux is regulated by USP17L at the transcriptional level. Given Usp17l is known to be a target of DUX10. The reciprocal regulation between DUX and USP17L may represent a positive feedback loop that facilitates the rapid induction of 2C genes.Fig. 2USP17LE decreases H2AK119ub1 to derepress Dux.A Top, schematic showing the establishment of Usp17le OE and Usp17le OE-Dux KD mESCs.

The Gene Ontology terms of genes exhibiting increased/decreased H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 are shown at the bottom.",
        "We then asked how USP17L regulates Dux. It has been reported that USP17 family members act as deubiquitinating enzymes, and USP17LE has the core structural site of the deubiquitination enzymes27 (Supplementary Fig. 3A, red). In particular, USP proteins (e.g., USP16 and USP21) have been shown to be involved in the regulation of H2AK119ub148,49, a repressive mark deposited by PRC150. Interestingly, H2AK119ub1, as well as the closely related repressive mark H3K27me351, was highly enriched at the Dux locus in ESCs (Fig. 2E), which further increased in Usp17l KD cells (Fig. 2E, right). It is worth noting that as the Dux locus exists as tandem repeats52, multi-mapping reads were included when studying chromatin marks in this region. In Usp17l KD ESCs, H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 were globally increased (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. 3B). H2AK119ub1 increased at a large number of gene promoters (n = 3149) (fold change of RPKM ≥ 1.5) in Usp17l KD ESCs, but only decreased at a limited number of genes (n = 30) (Fig. 2F, left). A similar trend, but to a lesser extent, was observed for H3K27me3 (increased, n = 1930; decreased, n = 1366) (Fig. 2F, right). Notably, the increase of H2AK119ub1 (Fig. 2F, left) and H3K27me3 (Fig. 2F, right) at Dux ranked number 7 and number 1, respectively, among all genes. Given Dux activates Usp17l10,12, the possible positive feedback may also enhance the changes of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 at the Dux locus. Among 2C genes, only Dux was strongly enriched for H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 (Fig. 2F, red). These data indicate that USP17L may regulate Dux through regulating H2AK119ub1 near its locus, and the downregulation of other 2C genes may be achieved indirectly (e.g., in part through Dux and other factors).",
        "Apart from Dux, genes exhibiting increased promoter H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 were mainly involved in development and cell differentiation (Fig. 2F, bottom), consistent with their functions in regulating developmental genes51. Genes with decreased H2AK119ub1 were not enriched for any GO terms, likely due to the small number (n = 30). Genes with decreased H3K27me3 upon Usp17l KD were involved in protein transport, spermatogenesis, DNA damage response, and apoptosis (Fig. 2F, bottom right). The increase of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 was not associated with gene expression changes globally (Supplementary Fig. 3C, grey, R = −0.06 to −0.02), including those at developmental genes (Supplementary Fig. 3C, black), consistent with the fact that these genes are already repressed in WT ESCs. These data suggest that while H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 were globally altered in Usp17l KD ESCs, the changes at the Dux locus are among the most pronounced ones. Altogether, these data suggest that USP17L deubiquitinates H2AK119ub1 and promotes the expression of Dux and other 2C genes.",
        "We then asked if USP17L can indeed deubiquitinate H2AK119ub1. We first confirmed that USP17L KD caused an increase of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 in Western blot in ESCs (Fig. 3A), consistent with the ChIP-seq result (Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. 3B). Conversely, overexpression of USP17LE, but not a catalytic mutant with a mutation in a conserved site (C60A, denoted USP17LEC60A)27, could deubiquitinate H2AK119ub1 in mESCs, as shown by Western blot (Fig. 3B, red arrow, and Supplementary Fig. 4A). Supporting such deubiquitination activity, H2AK119ub1 levels decreased in Usp17l-overexpressing ESCs in immunofluorescence (Fig. 3C, D). H3K27me3 also tended to decrease in Usp17l overexpressed ESCs (Fig. 3D), agreeing with the notion that H2AK119ub1 can recruit PRC253. Consistently, Zscan4+ cells exhibited lower levels of H2AK119ub1 compared with those of Zscan4− ESCs (Fig. 3E, F), as shown previously21. Interestingly, H3K9me2/3 levels were decreased upon USP17L KD in ESCs (Fig. 3A), suggesting that USP17L may directly or indirectly regulate H3K9me2/3. Taken together, these data indicate that USP17L can deubiquitinate H2AK119ub1.Fig. 3USP17LE promotes 2C gene transcription by deubiquitinating H2AK119ub1.A Western blot showing the levels of various modified histones in control and Usp17l knockdown ESCs (3 biological replicates).

        "We further tested whether USP17L regulates 2C gene expression through H2AK119ub1. We first treated ESCs with a specific inhibitor (PRT4165) of H2AK119ub154, and then analyzed the transcription levels of the 2C genes. H2AK119ub1 gradually decreased with increasing treatment time of PRT4165 (Supplementary Fig. 4B, C). Consistent with our hypothesis, transcription of 2C genes such as Zscan4 and Tcstv1 was increased shortly (1 h) following the inhibition of H2AK119ub1 (Supplementary Fig. 4D). ZSCAN4 protein levels also increased at a later time point (3 h) (Supplementary Fig. 4E). By contrast, OCT4 also decreased although to a lesser extent (Supplementary Fig. 4B, C). These data imply that H2AK119ub1 may repress the 2C genes, presumably through Dux inhibition. Importantly, inhibition of H2AK119ub1 by PRT4165 in Usp17l knockdown cell lines rescued the expression of 2C genes, such as Tcstv1, Zscan4, and MERVL (Fig. 3G, H). Taken together, these data suggest that USP17L can deubiquitinate H2AK119ub1 and further activate 2C genes including Dux.",
        "Besides H2AK119ub1, we asked if USP17L may also have non-histone substrates. Interestingly, it was reported that ZSCAN4 was subjected to ubiquitination-dependent degradation in a human cancer cell line Tu167 by an E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF2055. Therefore, we sought to examine if USP17L regulates ZSCAN4 protein. Treatment of ESCs with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, led to rapid accumulation of ZSCAN4 protein (Fig. 4A), suggesting that ZSCAN4 is under active degradation in ESCs. Encouragingly, overexpression of USP17LE increased ZSCAN4 protein levels and the ratio of Zscan4+ cell population in ESCs (Fig. 4B, C). Treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) reduced ZSCAN4 protein levels in ESCs, which can be mitigated by USP17LE overexpression (Fig. 4D). To ask if USP17L directly deubiquitinates ZSCAN4, we overexpressed these two proteins in ESCs and found that USP17LE interacted with ZSCAN4 and reduced ubiquitination of ZSCAN4 (Fig. 4E). The global ubiquitination level appeared to decrease upon USP17LE overexpression (Fig. 4E, the 2nd lane). We cannot rule out the possibility that USP17LE also regulates other histone or non-histone targets. Importantly, overexpression of USP17LE, but not the catalytic mutant USP17LEC60A, increased ZSCAN4 protein levels (Fig. 4F), suggesting that USP17LE stabilizes ZSCAN4 in part through deubiquitinating ZSCAN4.Fig. 4USP17LE stabilizes ZSCAN4 via deubiquitination.A Western blot showing the accumulation of ZSCAN4 after treatment with MG132 (10 μM) in ESCs.

        "To further define the key regions of USP17LE in the recognition of ZSCAN4, various truncated USP17LE mutants were overexpressed in ESCs (Fig. 4G and Supplementary Fig. 5A). Specifically, USP17LE∆408–506, but not others, including USP17LE∆458–506, abrogated the protective effect of USP17LE on ZSCAN4 (Compare Fig. 4H, D and Supplementary Fig. 5A), suggesting an essential protection function of amino acids 408–457, which was embedded in a hypervariable (HV) domain (365–461aa) that may confer substrate specificity56. Analysis using FoldUnfold57 revealed that this sequence consisted of a disordered region (408–448 aa, Fig. 4I, shaded in cyan), and a relatively stable region (449–457 aa) (Fig. 4I, shaded in pink). The stable region (EVELDLPVD) contained two aspartate residues that potentially account for substrate recognition, as inferred based on the substrate interaction site of USP758–60. Indeed, mutation of these two sites (denoted USP17LED453A/D457A) affected the binding of USP17LE with ZSCAN4 (Supplementary Fig. 5B) and abrogated the protection of ZSCAN4 proteins (Fig. 4J, K). Consistently, overexpression of USP17LED453A/D457A can no longer increase the ratio of Zscan4+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 5C). These results suggest that ZSCAN4 protein can be degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation and that USP17LE protects ZSCAN4 by deubiquitination.",
        "We then asked if Usp17l and H2AK119ub1 may regulate Dux and the 2C program in mouse embryos. Reanalysis of published data61 showed that H2AK119ub1 was highly enriched near Dux in mouse oocytes, decreased at the 1-cell and early 2-cell stages when Dux was activated (Fig. 5A, B)62, and then increased and remained at high levels at the late 2-cell stage until the blastocyst stage (Fig. 5A). Therefore, the dynamics of H2AK119ub1 at the Dux locus negatively correlated with the expression changes of Dux during mouse pre-implantation development. H3K27me3 was also enriched in mouse oocytes, decreased after fertilization, but was not restored until in ICM (Fig. 5C). The slower restoration of H3K27me3 was consistent with the lack of de novo H3K27me3 at promoters in mouse pre-implantation embryos63. These data also indicate that H3K27me3 may be not a major repressor of Dux in mouse pre-implantation embryos.Fig. 5H2AK119ub1 is enriched at the Dux locus in mouse embryos.A The UCSC genome browser view showing global H2AK119ub1 (top) and that near Dux locus (bottom) in mouse early embryos.

        "We then asked if USP17L can also reduce H2AK119ub1 and promote the expression of Dux and 2C program in mouse embryos. We injected Usp17l siRNAs that targeted all Usp17l gene family members in mouse zygotes at the pronuclear stage 3 (PN3) (Fig. 6A). We confirmed the efficient Usp17l KD in mouse late 2C embryos (Fig. 6B, left). Spike-in normalized Stacc-seq4 for H2AK119ub1 and CUT&RUN64 for H3K27me3, however, showed that unlike that in ESCs, Usp17l KD did not affect H2AK119ub1 or H3K27me3 globally at the late 2C stage (Fig. 6C, left, “KD”, and 6D, the 1st and 3rd columns), as also confirmed by immunostaining (Fig. 6E). At the Dux locus, H2AK119ub1 was largely unaffected upon Usp17l KD (Fig. 6C, right, “KD” for “H2AK119ub1”, and 6D, the 1st column, red). H3K27me3 remained overall low with moderate increase upon Usp17l KD (Fig. 6C, right, “KD” for “H3K27me3”, and 6D, the 3rd column). Usp17l KD did not have an apparent impact on mouse pre-implantation development (Fig. 7A, B, compare “KD” with “Ctrl”) or major ZGA (Fig. 7C, left, and 7D). Minor ZGA showed only moderate downregulation in Usp17l KD late 2C embryos (Fig. 7C, left, and 7D), as exemplified by Zscan4 family genes (Fig. 7E). Dux was evidently downregulated (Fig. 7E). Given that H2AK119ub1 was not affected near Dux upon Usp17l KD, we speculate that the expression of Dux may be also regulated by additional mechanisms, at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels (such as RNA stability)44,65–67.Fig. 6USP17L reduces H2AK119ub1 at the Dux locus in mouse embryos.A Schematic showing injection of siRNA cocktail targeting all Usp17l family genes or Usp17le mRNAs into mouse PN3 zygotes and examination of RNA, H2AK119ub1, and H3K27me3 at the late 2C stage.

        "To overcome the possible redundancy of USP17L and other deubiquitinases such as USP16, a maternal protein that can deubiquitinate H2AK119ub1 in oocytes and is present in both oocytes and early embryos68, we overexpressed Usp17le in mouse embryos by injecting Usp17le mRNA in mouse PN3 zygotes. Considering the presence of Usp16 and endogenous Usp17l, Usp17le was expressed at high levels (Fig. 6B, right). Usp17le OE caused a substantial global reduction of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 (Fig. 6C, left, “OE” for “H2AK119ub1” and “H3K27me3”, and 6D, the 2nd and 4th columns), which was confirmed by immunostaining (Fig. 6E). At the Dux locus, while H3K27me3 remained low upon Usp17le OE (Fig. 6C, right, “OE” for “H3K27me3”, and 6D, the 4th column, red), H2AK119ub1 decreased markedly (Fig. 6C, right, “OE” for “H2AK119ub1”, and 6D, the 2nd column, red). Usp17le OE embryos developed normally to the 2C stage, but showed partial delay at the 4C stage, and complete arrest at the 8C-morula stage (Fig. 7A, B, compare “OE” with “Ctrl”). Despite the largely normal maternal RNA decay at the late 2C stage (Fig. 7C, right), minor ZGA genes, including other Usp17l members, Zscan4 family genes and Dux, were all upregulated (Fig. 7C, right, and 7D, E). Additionally, several classes of repeats, including LINE1 (L1Md_F, L1Md_T) and MERVL (MT2_Mm, MERVL_int) that are normally activated in minor ZGA were also upregulated upon Usp17le OE (Fig. 7F). Major ZGA genes were partially decreased possibly due to slight developmental delay at the late 2C stage (Fig. 7C, right, and 7D). It should be noted that the upregulation of minor ZGA genes was unlikely due to developmental delay, as the activation were dramatically increased at levels much higher than those in control embryos at the late 2C stage (Fig. 7D) when the levels of minor ZGA peaked in WT embryos (Supplementary Fig. 6A), as also exemplified by the Zscan4 gene family (Supplementary Fig. 6B). Therefore, consistent with the observations in ESCs, these results indicate that USP17L-mediated removal of H2AK119ub1 can promote Dux expression and 2C program in mouse embryos.",
        "2C genes have attracted great interests in the field of stem cell, development and gene regulation. These genes are closely linked to totipotency in 2-cell embryos and 2CLCs, for reasons that still remain largely unknown. They are also subjected to unique regulation as these genes undergo a rapid induction during the 1-cell and 2-cell stages, before declining soon after the 2-cell stage. Despite being a prominent marker gene for 2-cell embryos and 2CLCs, the function of USP17L remains poorly understood. Moreover, H2AK119ub1 was reported to decrease in 2CLCs compared to ESCs21, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report a role of Usp17l in the activation of the 2C program in mESC and possibly in embryos as well. Our data support a model that USP17LE deubiquitinates H2AK119ub1 near Dux, thus derepressing Dux and downstream 2C genes, including Zscan4 and retrotransposons such as MERVL (Fig. 7G). Given that DUX can also activate Usp17l genes10,12, this may represent a positive feedback loop (Fig. 7G). Such positive feedback may facilitate the rapid induction of 2C genes in a short time window, which then need to be swiftly shut down at the late 2C stage when major ZGA occurs through negative regulators such as DUXBL69. Persist expression of Dux has been shown to arrest embryos at the 2-cell stage13,66. In addition, ZSCAN4 can also be protected and stabilized through deubiquitination by USP17L (Fig. 7G). These data suggest that USP17L can regulate the 2C program both at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Of note, we do not exclude the possibility that USP17L may have other targets besides H2AK119ub1 and ZSCAN4.",
        "In contrast to that in mESCs, Usp17l KD in mouse embryos has only a moderate effect on H2AK119ub1, minor ZGA, and pre-implantation development. Several scenarios could be envisioned to explain the difference. First, USP17L may be redundant with other deubiquitinases such as USP16. Second, the function of Dux is also possibly compensated by other regulators of minor ZGA, given that Dux KO only had a mild effect on ZGA in mouse embryos13–15. For example, OBOX has been shown to regulate many targets of DUX16,70 and OBOX4 redundantly drives ZGA in the absence of Dux71. Of note, Usp16 and Obox genes were absent or only lowly expressed in mESCs compared to those in mouse oocytes or pre-implantation embryos16,68, which may account for the lack of such redundancy in mESCs. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that USP17L functions differently in these two contexts. The conclusion that USP17L regulates the 2C program both at the transcriptional and post-translational levels is primarily based on data in mESCs. The roles of USP17L in mouse early embryogenesis warrant further investigation, which may require combined disruption of USP17L and other potentially redundant factors. We also expect that the targets of USP17L may not be limited to histones and ZSCAN4. In sum, our findings identify USP17L as a key regulator of the 2C genes in mESCs, paving the way for future studies of the regulatory circuitry underlying the 2C program, ZGA, and totipotency.",

        "Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is a major cause of death globally, remains a great challenge for clinical remedy. CVD contains a wide array of disorders, including acute coronary syndrome, congenital heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, arrhythmias, etc.\n1",
        "The design and development of novel drugs and their application in disease treatments in the human model have many limitations. Also, the safety and efficacy of preclinical findings in two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and animal models fail to represent human physiological conditions. To overcome these obstacles, three-dimensional (3D) cell models mimic human tissue-like, cell-cell, and cell-matrix interactions and enhance biological understanding during drug discovery and disease modeling.\n2,3",
        "Organoids are 3D in vitro cell constructs that include multiple cell types (i.e. induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with other supporting co-cultured cells such as endothelial cells or fibroblasts).\n4\n By using the inherent self-assembly property of stem cells, organoids can be considered organ-like multicellular constructs with key characteristics including; 1) similarity to an original organ due to having more than one type of cell, 2) the existence of some specific functions related to the original organs including metabolic and physiologic function\n5\n, 3) having a resemblance to the native organ in terms of microscale tissue architecture, genes and protein expression.\n6",
        "In recent years, the creation of the human heart organoid has received much attention due to its potential applications (Figure 1). In this review, we present an overview of the recent advances in heart organoid generation as novel tools for modeling human cardiac biology and disease.",
        "Human heart organoid potential applications",
        "A literature search was done in electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar. A combination of the terms “organoid”, “cardiac organoid”, “heart organoid”, “stem cells”, “cardiac drug screening”, “regenerative medicine”, “three-dimensional cell culture”, “3D cell culture” were used. Case reports, editorial letters, gray literatures, unpublished reports and papers for which full texts were not available in English were considered as exclusion criteria. The latest date of these searches was on September 1, 2022. We reviewed recent knowledge about human cardiac organoid generation and summarized evidences in the realm of the generation of cardiac organoids, architectural design, cardiac organoids modeling in human cardiac diseases- in vitro and stem-cell based cardiac regeneration: limitations and gaps.",
        "Organoids are created from single cells/stem cells. Among the stem cells, either embryonic stem cells or tissue-resident, can be employed for this cultivation with special structural pillars and defined growth factors.\n7\n After co-cultivation, the cells undergo self-organization and differentiation similar to the processes in vivo.\n8",
        "The human heart consists of cardiomyocytes (~60%), with the remaining ~ 14% endothelial cells and approximately 24% cardiac fibroblasts as the principal non-myocyte cell type. The rest are a small number of smooth muscle cells, epicardial cells, conductance cells, and immune cells.\n4,9\n The limited regenerative capacity of cardiomyocytes (CMs) in adult cardiovascular tissue is the main cause of its inability to repair itself or self-renew after injury.\n10",
        "The advances in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) technology and cardiogenic differentiation resulted into an unlimited source of human cardiomyocytes for biomedical research. However, hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) in traditional 2D culture lack many essential anatomical and physiological features, which hampers their capacity to predict human biology. A potential solution for this problem is multicellular 3D cardiac organoids.\n11,12",
        "The development of 3D cardiac organoids culture conditions is faced with a significant challenge such as the identification of the precise primary and supporting cells ratio, culture media component, and specific conditions that mimic the biology of the tissue model. CMs differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) with molecular, biochemical, and functional properties of adult CM is a very important challenge in organoid research techniques. In pioneering studies, the potential of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) - derived cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) for the development of mature CMs has been widely considered.\n13,14",
        "Structural pillars including collagen, matrigel or fibrin are another important prerequisite for the generation of cardiac organoids. Having biomimetic, perfusable vasculature, electromechanical integrity and conductivity properties are basic requirements for designing 3D cardiovascular tissue constructs.\n15",
        "Although matrigel is the most commonly used matrix for 3D cultures of almost all kinds of epithelial and endothelial cells due to its close resemblance to the native extracellular matrix (ECM), using it has some disadvantages in organoid technology due to:\n7,16",
        "Complex composition",
        "Batch to Batch variation",
        "Lack of reproducibility in cell culture experiment",
        "Impossibility of being easily tailored to obtain specific organoid niches for specific organs",
        "Given the undesirable properties of matrigel, other chemically and mechanically well-defined natural and synthetic scaffolds for organoid cultures have been evaluated recently. Considering their similarity to human ECM, some natural polymer-based hydrogels such as natural hydrogels, hyaluronic acid (HA), alginate, chitosan, PEG (Poly Ethylene Glycol)\n17\n are preferred.",
        "In general, Matrigel-based organoids lack the aforementioned essential properties, are not suitable for in vivo transplantation and cell therapy studies, and as a result, some natural alternatives to matrigel are preferred regarding their inherent bioactivity and similarity to human ECM.",
        "Organoids, which are morphologically and physiologically closest to organs with tissue-like in vitro conditions, offer a different and unique opportunity to study diseases. This issue becomes more important in the case of heart disease due to the special conditions of the heart. A group of cardiac diseases is defined as non-genetic diseases. Many Factors such as aging, interaction with other organs, diet, and toxicity can play an important role in causing these diseases. Myocardial infarction is defined as one of the most important and fatal diseases in this category. This disease begins with the interruption or severe restriction of blood flow in an area of the heart, causing hypoxia and subsequent scar tissue formation in this region, and the loss of cardiomyocytes in this way causes the heart to be unable to perform its function naturally. This situation leads to death or severely affects the patient’s quality of life. 3D organoid technology gives us this opportunity to model the developmental stages of this disease in vitro, to carefully examine the progression and course of this disease, and to obtain new results. Additionally, the survival of the surrounding cells can be able to regenerate damaged regions. These regeneration stages can also be investigated and researched by using organoids.",
        "Genetic diseases are another category of heart disease. Genetic mutations in cardiomyocytes over time cause abnormal heart function, heart failure, or disease. In the field of these diseases, the use of organoids and disease modeling can also improve our knowledge about the process of development and treatment of these diseases. In 2016, Cashman et al were able to develop the first 3D human-engineered cardiac tissue model by using hiPSCs.\n18",
        "In 2020, Lewis-Israeli et al presented a new method for producing human heart organoids using pluripotent stem cells. Human heart organoids (hHOs) were generated using a two-step conventional Wnt signaling modulation strategy under well-defined culture conditions. Further, this group was able to generate the first laboratory model of diabetes during pregnancy to study embryonic congenital heart defects.\n19\n In 2019, Keung et al created human cardiac ventricular-like organoid chambers from pluripotent stem cells and investigated the effects of many drugs on these organoids.\n20\n In 2018, Anderson et al generated a new heart organoid for the study of heart field/chamber-specific diseases.\n21",
        "In a 2019 study, Zhao et al designed a cardiac tissue culture platform that was independent of cell source, and enabled drug testing under electrical pacing. They designed electrophysiologically different atrial and ventricular tissues with drug responses and different gene expression levels. This group managed to generate heteropolar cardiac tissues containing separate atrial and ventricular terminals for the first time. In this way, this group was able to model left ventricular hypertrophy with 8-month electrical conditioning.\n22",
        "Recently, there has been a lot of research on organoid modeling of heart disease. The generation of these models will give us information about the formation and progression of different diseases and even their treatments.\n23",
        "In human adults, the myocardium is one of the tissues that have a very low regeneration capacity. This feature of the myocardium causes heart failure conditions. Today, heart failure is the group of diseases that are the deadliest in the world. Recently, many studies by scientists have focused on triggering the endogenous regeneration of the heart. A group of studies is investigating why the regeneration of the heart tissue of mammals is active in the neonatal period. The discovery of this internal mechanism may be the hope for the adult human heart to regain the regeneration feature with the endogenous mechanisms.\n24",
        "On the other hand, many scientists in the field of human regenerative medicine are investigating the use of pluripotent cells in the regeneration of heart tissue. One group of these studies focuses on the transplantation of cardiomyocytes differentiated from these cells into the heart tissue, while the other part is working on new factors that promote the regeneration of cardiac tissue.\n25,26\n In 2017, Tiburcy et al were able to create a model of heart failure and heart repair using iPSCs and embryonic stem cells.\n27",
        "Mills et al in a study conducted in 2017, examined the CM cell cycle arrest mechanism in detail in the human cardiac organoid that they created. The advantage of this research was the creation of the 3D phenotype and the study of this mechanism. In addition, in this study, the positive and negative effects of the components that play a role in cell proliferation, were investigated.\n28",
        "In a study conducted by the same research group in 2019, the effect of 105 different small molecules with pro-regenerative potentials was investigated after cardiac organoids were created from hiPSCs.\n29",
        "In 2017, Voges et al investigated the capacity of regenerating human immature heart tissue using cardiac organoids. In this study, the potential of repairing the damaged tissue caused by dry ice, was evaluated for two weeks. The obtained results showed that immature human hearts can regenerate intrinsically.",
        "It is very promising that organoids can create models of cardiac diseases and the results can used in the treatment of heart diseases, as well as researching regeneration mechanisms on 3D cardiac organoids and in human heart regeneration. These researches have been increasing recently and valuable information on heart regeneration will be obtained in the field of regenerative medicine.\n30",
        "As shown in pioneering investigations, iPSCs-derived cardiomyocytes have the ability to contract, special potency for expressing the essential receptors for hormonal regulation of the myocardium and even forming gap junctions. Despite what was mentioned, prior to the initiation of cell based human clinical trials, more detailed investigations are needed in the realm of the risk of pluripotency-associated teratoma induced immunogenicity.\n31-33\n Additionally, the long-term beneficial effects of a pure cell-based strategy (e.g. with iPSC) have a lot of flaws in terms of surviving in the injured myocardium micro-environment.\n34\n Furthermore, based on recent evidences, organoids derived from ESCs may be rejected by the host immune system. In addition, since ESCs are created from early human embryos, they can be ethically problematic.\n35\n Generally, inconsistencies in the reported engraftment rate, probability of tumorigenesis and the risk of arrhythmia may be the main concern of pluripotent stem cell-based therapies in CVDs.\n36,37",
        "Nowadays, human cardiac organoids for CVDs modelling have brought about considerable progress in the realm of maturation, improving cell therapy, and drug screening studies. This technology rapidly expands our knowledge in CVDs therapy. Given the improvement of organoid production technology, significant progress is expected in its application. At present, only one clinical trial using ESC- derived cardiomyocytes is ongoing.\n38\n However, according to the mentioned limitations, more investigations in large- animal models are warranted to assess the safety and efficacy of cardiac regenerative therapy prior to translating these therapies to clinical trials.",

The human ESC-derived optic cup is much larger than the mouse ESC-derived one, presumably reflecting the species differences. The neural retina in human ESC culture is thick and spontaneously curves in an apically convex manner, which is not seen in mouse ESC culture. In addition, human ESC-derived neural retina grows into multilayered tissue containing both rods and cones, whereas cone differentiation is rare in mouse ESC culture. The accumulation of photoreceptors in human ESC culture can be greatly accelerated by Notch inhibition. In addition, we show that an optimized vitrification method enables en bloc cryopreservation of stratified neural retina of human origin. This storage method at an intermediate step during the time-consuming differentiation process provides a versatile solution for quality control in large-scale preparation of clinical-grade retinal tissues.

      "title": "Developmental wave of programmed ganglion cell death in human retinal organoids",
      "abstract": "The delicate and complex structure of the neural retina that enables proper visual function is achieved during embryonic development through a precise balance of proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Retinal ganglion cells (RGC), the only output neurons of the retina, show a steady increase in numbers during development except for two waves of cell death that are highly conserved in vertebrates. However, the mechanisms responsible for these phenomena and their conservation in the human retina are incompletely understood. In this work we took advantage of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived retinal organoids to explore these questions. Using different markers and quantitative techniques in three different hiPSC lines, we found a consistent decrease in RGC numbers at week 8 of differentiation, a developmental stage that is equivalent to that of the first wave of RGC death in other species. This decrease coincided with a peak in caspase 3 activation and TUNEL(+) staining, suggesting an apoptotic mechanism. Notably, this was accompanied by a decrease in the BAX/BCL2 ratio and a lack of caspase 9 activation. However, we observed a marked increase in caspase 8 activation at this stage, suggesting the involvement of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Together, these results show for the first time the intrinsic ability of the human retina to regulate RGC numbers through programmed cell death mechanisms, which could lead to new insights regarding congenital retinal abnormalities. Moreover, this work has implications for experimental design in basic and translational research using human stem cell-derived retinal organoid models.",

Moreover, this work has implications for experimental design in basic and translational research using human stem cell-derived retinal organoid models.",
        "The retina is a complex central nervous system structure with a histoarchitecture that is fine-tuned for visual function. This cellular and structural specificity arises during embryonic development through a delicate balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and death, and a disruption in this balance can lead to congenital retinal abnormalities, and ultimately, visual impairment. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that regulate these processes to specify the correct numbers of each retinal cell type are poorly understood, particularly in the human retina.",
        "Two waves of retinal developmental cell death have been described in animal models including zebrafish, chick, and mouse 1–6. The main cell type affected by these waves of cell death are retinal ganglion cells (RGC), the first cell type to differentiate in the retina and the only to relay visual information from the retina to the brain 2,5–7. The second wave of cell death has been more extensively studied and is hypothesized to be responsible for the refinement of the visual pathway 2,6,8,9. The leading hypothesis is that during RGC maturation, as these cells extend their axons to the visual centers in the brain, those who fail to make proper connections undergo programmed cell death due to the lack of retrograde neurotrophic support 2,6,8,9.",
        "Conversely, the first wave of cell death is less well understood yet highly evolutionarily conserved. Studies in zebrafish, and chicks have identified apoptotic cell death as a primary mechanism responsible for this phenomenon 3,4,6,10, whereas recent studies in mice have suggested that this process is driven by complement-induced phagoptosis by microglia 1. However, while animal models have provided important insights, the mechanisms underlying RGC death and the degree of conservation of these mechanisms in humans remain unknown due to experimental limitations.",
        "In this context, human stem cell-derived retinal organoids offer new opportunities to investigate these developmental processes. Not only do these three-dimensional retinal tissues mimic the in vivo retinal histoarchitecture, cellular composition and some degree of functionality, but, importantly, they have been shown to recapitulate all of the main features of retinal development following a species-specific spatio-temporal sequence 11–17.",
        "In this study we took advantage of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived retinal organoids as a model to study the mechanisms of RGC death during human development. Immunohistochemical and live fluorescent reporter quantification time course studies identified a trough in RGC numbers at 8 weeks of differentiation. This developmental stage is consistent with the early wave of RGC death identified in other species, suggesting that this mechanism may be conserved in humans. This phenomenon could not be attributed to a microglia-mediated mechanism, as this cell type was absent in retinal organoids. Conversely, we found a strong correlation of caspase 3-mediated programmed cell death. Moreover, an increase in caspase 8 activation without increases in cleaved caspase 9 or BAX/BCL2 ratios suggests the involvement of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in this process.",
        "Thus, this study is the first to describe the intrinsic ability of the human retina to regulate RGC numbers through developmental cell death mechanisms. This has implications for the understanding of conditions that result from the dysregulation of retinal development, as well as for the application of stem cell-derived retinal organoids to disease modeling and therapeutic development.",
        "We used stem cell-derived human retinal organoids to investigate whether the early wave of RGC death occurs in humans. Retinal organoids recapitulate retinal structure and function, but importantly, also mimic the steps of development as they happen in vivo\n11–17. Thus, they constitute an ideal model for studying retinal developmental mechanisms that affect the human retina in an in vitro human 3D tissue context.",
        "We focused our analysis on a window of differentiation from weeks 6 to 10, encompassing the onset of RGC differentiation through subsequent maturation. This time frame captures the initial emergence and expansion of RGCs, beginning around day 42 of differentiation. This stage has been shown to align with early RGC specification in both human retina and retinal organoids 11,12,15,17,18.",
        "To evaluate changes in the RGC population over time, we performed immunohistochemistry using HuC/D, a well-established marker of early postmitotic neurons, including RGCs 19. We quantified the HuC/D-positive area relative to total retinal area to measure RGC abundance across developmental time points. As expected, our results showed a steady increase in RGC numbers from week 6 to 7 of differentiation (Fig. 1A–B,F). Interestingly, at 8 weeks we observed a sudden dip in RGC numbers, followed by a steady increase in the subsequent weeks (Fig. 1C–E,F). The time of this dip in RGC numbers is suggestive of an increase in cell death and is consistent with the developmental timing of the early wave of RGC death described in other vertebrates 1,3,4,6,10,12.",
        "To validate this observation, we used the PGP1 triple-transgenic hiPSC line, which expresses eGFP under the POU4F2 promoter; an early and specific marker of RGCs, alongside VSX2 promoter-driven cerulean and RCVRN promoter-driven mCherry, as reporters for retinal progenitors and photoreceptor precursors, respectively. This enabled longitudinal tracking of specific retinal cell types in live organoids. Using the validated 3D Automated Reporter Quantification (3D-ARQ) method 18, we quantified fluorescent reporter expression from weeks 7 to 10. Consistent with HuC/D-based analysis, we observed a significant reduction in POU4F2-eGFP signal at week 8 (Suppl. Fig. 1), followed by recovery. In contrast, mCherry signal increased steadily during this period, suggesting the dip in eGFP expression was specific to RGCs. Moreover, this and the observed recovery in RGC numbers after week 8, suggest that the RGC decline is not due to organoid stress, necrosis or toxicity.",
        "In mice, microglia-mediated phagoptosis has been identified as a key mechanism underlying the early elimination of RGCs during development in mouse models 1. However, it has been previously reported that microglia are not present in retinal organoids, since organoid generation favors cells of neuroectodermal lineage 11,15. To confirm this, we examined the presence of microglia at week 8 of differentiation.",
        "We performed immunohistochemical staining for IBA1, a well-established marker of microglia in both adult and developing human retina Retinal organoids and adult human retinal sections from cadaver eyes were processed in parallel. As expected, IBA1-positive microglia were readily detected in the adult human retina, displaying characteristic morphology (Fig. 2A–B). In contrast, no IBA1 signal was observed in any of the retinal organoids at this stage (Fig. 2C–D). Furthermore, we performed RT-PCR for CD11B and CX3CR1, two additional microglial markers. Consistent with our immunostaining results, both markers were expressed in adult human retina but undetectable in retinal organoids (Fig. 2E). These findings, which align with previous reports, indicate that the reduction in RGC numbers during early organoid development occurs independently of microglia-mediated phagoptosis.",
        "The observed decrease in RGC numbers at 8 weeks of differentiation could also be explained by an increase in programmed cell death. Programmed cell death is known to be important for central nervous system development and has been found to be a major mechanism for the elimination of RGCs in other species, including zebrafish, Xenopus and chick 3,4,6,10,20. Additionally, caspase-mediated programmed cell death contributes to the elimination of RGCs in the adult human retina after injury and in degenerative eye diseases 2,21. However, whether this is the case in human retinal development has not been determined.",
        "To study the potential involvement of programmed cell death in this phenomenon, we performed immunohistochemistry for cleaved caspase 3 on retinal organoids collected between weeks 6 and 10 of differentiation. Cleavage activates caspase 3, a major effector of both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of the apoptotic cascade. Our results indicate very minimal levels of caspase 3 activation between 6 and 7 weeks of retinal organoid development, followed by a sudden peak of caspase 3 activation at 8 weeks, which coincides with the sudden decrease in RGC numbers (Fig. 3A–C,F). After 8 weeks, caspase 3 activation decreases suddenly (Fig 3D–F). Notably, the majority of cleaved caspase 3 staining co-localized with HuC/D staining (Suppl. Fig. 2), suggesting that RGCs are the major cell type affected by this mechanism. To validate these results, we performed TUNEL staining in retinal organoids at similar differentiation stages. Our quantification analysis showed a similar pattern of cell death, with a peak of TUNEL(+) staining at 8 weeks of differentiation (Fig. 3G). These results support the hypothesis that caspase 3 dependent cell death plays a major role in the trough of RGC numbers observed at this time point.",
        "To further investigate the mechanisms underlying programmed cell death during early retinal development, we examined the expression of key apoptotic markers in retinal organoids. Western blot analysis was performed on retinal organoids at week 8 of differentiation—when RGC loss is most pronounced—and compared to week 7, when cell death remains minimal.",
        "Consistent with our immunofluorescence findings, we observed a marked increase in cleaved caspase-3 levels at week 8 (Fig. 4A), confirming active apoptosis. Surprisingly, however, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio decreased at this stage (Fig. 4A–B), suggesting a shift toward an anti-apoptotic state within the intrinsic pathway. In line with this, we found no evidence of caspase-9 cleavage, indicating that the intrinsic apoptotic cascade is not the primary driver of cell death at this time point.",
        "Instead, we observed a significant increase in cleaved caspase-8, a hallmark of extrinsic apoptotic pathway activation (Fig. 4A, C). These findings suggest that the early wave of RGC death in human retinal organoids is mediated primarily through extrinsic apoptosis, although the specific death ligands and receptors responsible for initiating this pathway remain to be identified.",
        "The retina is a neural tissue whose function is dependent on the finely tuned complexity of its structure. This structure arises during development through a delicate balance of cell proliferation, differentiation, and death 7. Despite the crucial importance of this balance for producing a tissue with the right proportions of different cell types, relatively very little is known about how retinal cell numbers are regulated during development. In this work, we focused on how programmed cell death affects the development of RGCs in the human retina.",
        "Two waves of cell death primarily affecting RGCs have been described in vertebrate retina development 1–6,10,20. These waves seem to be highly evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that they play an important developmental role. The later wave of RGC death is thought to represent a circuit refinement, as it takes place when RCGs are making their synaptic connections to their brain targets 2,6,9. The leading hypothesis is that when correct synapses are formed, those circuits are strengthened by retrograde neurotrophic support that promotes the survival of RGCs, and the cells that fail to make connections undergo cell death 2,6,9. This is represented in retinal organoid models by the depletion of retinal ganglion cells that occurs between 15 and 18 weeks of differentiation 11,15. Moreover, a recent study on assembloids—models made of a retinal organoid linked to a brain organoid—revealed that RGCs were able to extend their axons to the brain organoid and showed increased survival rates. This finding further suggests that this process is comparable to the second wave of RGC death observed in vertebrates 22.",
        "In contrast, the earlier wave of developmental RGC death is poorly understood, although its evolutionary conservation suggests its importance as a developmental mechanism. Moreover, this phenomenon has never been investigated in humans. This gap in the knowledge prompted us to investigate the timing, pattern and mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon using human retinal organoids as a model.",
        "Our results using organoids derived from three human iPSC lines and evaluated using different RGCs markers and different methods of quantification, showed a steady increase in RGCs from 6 to 7 weeks of differentiation, followed by a sharp drop at week 8 (day 56). Subsequently, the number of RGCs began to steadily increase from weeks 9 to 10 of differentiation. The timing of this trough in RGC numbers is developmentally equivalent to that of the first wave of RGC death in other species 1,3,4,6,10,12, suggesting the conservation of the first wave of RGC death in human retinal organoids.",
        "When exploring the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, our results did not support a microglia-mediated mechanism, which had been reported in mice 1. Specifically, we did not find evidence of microglia presence in our retinal organoids, consistent with prior reports 11,15. Conversely, the sharp increase in RGC loss was highly correlated with a peak in caspase 3 activation and TUNEL-positive signal, pointing to caspase 3-dependent programmed cell death as a mechanism for RGC elimination in human retinal organoids. Moreover, activation of caspase 8 with concomitant lack of caspase 9 activation and a low Bax/Bcl2 ratio, suggested the involvement of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. However, the ligands that activate this pathway in retina development remain to be elucidated. From these experiments we cannot discard a possible microglial involvement in this phenomenon in vivo, which is a limitation of this study. However, the fact that this wave of RGC death occurs consistently in human retinal organoids indicates that programmed cell death is endogenous to the developing retinal tissue, and thus likely to occur in vivo as well. The discrepancies with previous studies could be attributed to species differences. It is also possible that programmed cell death co-exists with microglia-driven phagocytosis in the human retina, though this cannot be confirmed with the current model.",
        "In summary, our work sheds light onto the processes that shape the human retina during development, something that has been poorly explored in the past due to a lack of adequate models, and further supports the usefulness of human retinal organoids to study human retinal development. This research has important implications for our understanding of conditions that result from the dysregulation of retinal development, such as what occurs in Down syndrome, a condition driven by the triplication of chromosome 21 that presents with a supernumerary retina 23. Finally, these results may also have implications for the application of retinal organoid models in regenerative therapy and pharmacological testing.",
        "Human iPSC lines used in this study were the cord blood-derived episomal hiPSC line A18945 (Gibco), the RNA-reprogrammed, urine-derived hiPSC line iLC67–3 generated at the University of Colorado, and the triple transgenic reporter hiPSC line PGP1 generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) to replace stop codons of the VSX2, POU4F2, and RCVRN genes P2A sequences fused to Cerulean, green fluorescent protein, and mCherry reporter genes respectively 24. Quality control of cell lines included karyotypic analysis and routine mycoplasma testing by PCR. hiPSCs were maintained on Matrigel (growth-factor-reduced; BD Biosciences)-coated plates with mTeSR1 medium (Stemcell Technologies) according to WiCell protocols. Cells were passaged at ~70% confluence. Colonies containing differentiated cells were marked and mechanically removed before passaging. The use of hiPSCs in this study conforms to the University of Colorado Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC).",
        "Stem cells were maintained and differentiated into retinal organoids as previously described 17. Briefly, hiPSCs were cultured on mTeSR media following manufacturer’s specifications. On day 0 of the differentiation protocol, hiPSC colonies were lifted using dispase (Sigma), broken into small clumps by gentle pipetting, and cultured in suspension in a 37°C cell culture incubator with 5% CO2 to form embryoid bodies (EBs). Over the next 3 days they were gradually transitioned to neural induction medium containing DMEM/F12 (1:1), 1% N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 1 x minimum essential media-non essential amino acids (NEAAs), 2ug/ml heparin (Sigma). On day 7 the EBs were seeded on Matrigel coated plates. On day 16 they were transitioned to retinal differentiation medium (DMEM/F12 (3:1) supplemented with 2% B27 (without vitamin A, Invitrogen), 1x NEAA and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic (Gibco)). Between days 20–24 retinal domains were identified using phase contrast microscopy and mechanically and manually lifted from their plates using tungsten needles. The lifted retinal domains were grown in suspension and allowed to fold into retinal cups. Media was switched to DMEM/F12 (3:1) supplemented with 2% B27, 1x NEAA, and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic on day 30. On day 50, 1μM retinoic acid was added to the media daily.",
        "Retinal organoids were collected weekly between weeks 6 and 10 of differentiation (42, 49, 56, 63 and 70 days of differentiation). Organoids were washed in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. After fixation, organoids were transitioned through a sequential overnight incubation in 6.75%, 12.5% and 25% sucrose in 1x PBS, in order to equilibrate the osmotic pressure, before being embedded in Sakura Tissue-Tek OCT compound. The embedded organoids were frozen and stored at −80 °C until sectioned. Sections were taken on a Microm cryostat at −24 °C, at 12 μm in thickness. A de-identified human eye from a cadaveric donor (female, 65 years old) was obtained from the Miracles in Sight Eye Bank (North Carolina), fixed in 10% (w/v) methanol-free neutral buffered formalin for 2 hours, cryoprotected in a sucrose gradient and embedded in Sakura Tissue-Tek OCT compound for cryosectioning at 12 μm thickness. For protein analysis, retinal organoids were rinsed in PBS and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were then lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma) with protease inhibitors using a homogenizer, and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 14,000g. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Biorad DC Protein assay (BioRad).",
        "Three slides per retinal organoid were immunostained for each marker analyzed. For microglia analysis, human post mortem retinal slides were processed alongside differentiation week 8 (day 56) retinal organoids. Slides were washed in PBS three times for five minutes, then blocked for 1 hour in 10% normal donkey serum diluted in PBS 0.25% Triton X-100 (PBST) at room temperature (RT). Slides were then incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibody solution diluted in 2% normal donkey serum with 0.25% PBST. Primary antibodies used were mouse-anti-HuC/D antibody at 1/100 (Invitrogen, catalogue number A21271), rabbit-anti-IBA1 at 1/100 (Proteintech, cat# 10904–1-AP, AB_2224377) and rabbit-anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibody at 1/100 (Cell Signaling, cat# 9664, AB_2070042). Slides were then washed three times in PBS for five minutes and incubated for 1 hour at RT in the corresponding secondary antibodies diluted 1/1000 in 2% normal donkey serum with 0.25% PBST. Secondary antibodies used were donkey-anti-mouse Alexafluor 546 (Invitrogen, cat# A10036) and donkey-anti-rabbit Alexafluor 488 (Invitrogen, cat# A-21206). Slides were washed for five minutes in PBST, followed by two ten-minute washes in PBS, and mounted in DAPI mounting medium (SouthernBiotech DAPI Fluromount, cat# 0100–20) with a coverslip.",
        "Images were taken on a Nikon C2 confocal microscope and stitched together using Nikon Element software. Images were analyzed using Fiji/ImageJ. Five organoids were analyzed per collection time point for each marker (biological n=5). For each organoid, three slides from the middle of the organoid were imaged and analyzed (technical n=3), to minimize technical error. For each fluorescence microscopy image, a rectangular region of dimensions 180um × 220um was selected. In order to approximate RGC numbers, we measured the area of HuC/D positive immunostaining and expressed it as a ratio to the area of DAPI positive staining in the same region. To approximate the amount of programmed cell death we performed a similar analysis using the area of cleaved caspase 3-positive immunostaining to DAPI staining. Ratios were consistent across the three images per organoid per collection time point. The ratios from each slide were converted into percentages and the percentages from the three slides from each organoid were averaged.",
        "Longitudinal quantification of fluorescent reporters in live organoids was assessed using 3D-Automated Reporter Quantification as previously described 18,25. Briefly, organoids derived from the transgenic PGP1 hiPSC line were plated in clear u-bottom 96 well plates at 30 days of differentiation and cultured in these conditions thereafter. Total fluorescence intensity was assessed weekly between 7 and 10 weeks of differentiation using a Tecan Spark plate reader. Before each reading, organoids were washed twice in PBS and changed to DMEM FluoroBrite (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The instrument was pre-warmed to 37°C and top-reading mode was selected. After z-dimensional focusing, fluorescence intensity was read in 3×3 fields at the center of each well using 20 flashes and the following excitation and emission parameters: Cerulean (ex: 435nm/ em: 478nm), mCherry (ex: 567nm/ em: 625nm), eGFP (ex: 476nm/ em: 516nm), with a bandwidth of 10 nm. Wells with media alone were used for background subtraction and wild type retinal organoids of the same age were used as negative controls. Cerulean expression was as an approximation for size normalization within each time point.",
        "Protein levels were assessed by Western blot. Eight organoids were pooled per sample and 4 independent biological samples were analyzed per time point. Organoids were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma Aldrich) containing protease inhibitors (Roche). Protein concentrations were determined using the DC Protein Assay (BioRad). Proteins were separated in a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membranes using the iBlot2-System (Life Science Technologies). Membranes were blocked in 1X casein for 1 hour followed by incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C as indicated in Supplementary Table 1. Blots were then washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (supplementary table 1) for 30 minutes at room temperature. SuperSignal West Femto kit (Thermo Scientific) was used for chemoluminescent detection.",
        "Total RNA was purified from retinal organoids collected at week 8 using the RNAqueous Micro Kit (Invitrogen, cat#AM1931). Total RNA was also purified from the retina from a 52-year-old human female using the Direct-zol RNA Mini Prep (Zymo Research, cat#R2050S). Reverse transcription was performed using the Maxima H Minus cDNA Synthesis Master Mix with dsDNase (Thermo Scientific, cat#M1669). One microgram of cDNA from each sample was mixed with 0.125μL of BioReady rTaq, 0.25μL dNTP mix, 1.25μL of 10X reaction buffer, 9.375μL of water, and 0.5μL of a pooled mixture of either CD11B primer mix (forward: 5’-ATG GCT CTC AGA GTC CTT CT –3’; reverse: 5’-CTG CAT CAA AGA GAA CAA GGT TT-3’, 10μM each), CX3CR1 primer mix (forward: 5’-GAA GAG CTC TCT GGC TTC TG-3’; reverse: 5’-TTC AGG CAA CAA TGG CTA AAT G-3’, 10μM each), or Beta-actin primer mix.

        "Stem cells present multiple potential applications in regenerative medicine and are the subject of intense research [1]. The eye is a fascinating and promising target for stem cell therapies because it is a relatively immunologically privileged and surgically accessible self-contained system. Many ocular diseases such as corneal limbal stem cell deficiency, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, or retinal dystrophies could be treated with the use of tissue engineering.",
        "In this article, the authors summarise different aspects of stem cell therapy, discussing the nature of stem cells, their sources and culture, and presenting the most recent clinical applications in ophthalmology as well as potential uses in future.",
        "Stem cells are defined by their ability to regenerate multiple differentiated cell types, while retaining the capacity to self-replicate (Simonovitch et al. 1963). Those found in vivo have different origin and can be divided into 3 broad categories accordingly: embryonic (ESCs), foetal (FSCs) and adult stem cells (ASCs, among them mesenchymal stem cells – MSCs). Embryonic cells are pluripotent, derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, a stage of the pre-implantation embryo, 5-6 days post-fertilization [2]. They generate the organism, whereas the surrounding trophoblast cells contribute to the placental chorion. FSCs are multipotent cells located in the foetal tissues and embryonic annexes [3]. They have been subdivided into haematopoietic (blood, liver, bone marrow), mesenchymal (blood, liver, bone marrow, lung, kidney and pancreas), endothelial (bone marrow, placenta), epithelial (liver, pancreas) and neural ones (brain, spinal cord) [4]. Among FSCs the greatest potential use in regenerative medicine have stem cells found in foetal blood and in placenta because they are the easiest to harvest without harming the foetus. ASCs are multipotent tissue-resident stem cells, also termed progenitor cells, found in fully developed tissues. They reside in niches that create a special microenvironment for their replication and self-renewal.",
        "Very important for regenerative medicine are cell’s plasticity and ability to undergo the process of transdifferentiation. These two refer to the ability of some cells to give rise to cell types, formerly considered outside their normal repertoire of differentiation for the location where they are found [5]. Plasticity is the capacity of organisms or cells to alter their phenotype in response to changes in their environment [6]. Transdifferentiation is the transformation of a non-stem cell into a different cell type or the production of cells from a differentiated stem cell that are not related to its already established differentiation path [7].",
        "The discovery of those processes broadened the possibilities to derive stem cells from tissues. Takahashi and Yamanaka proved in 2006 that to reprogram a differentiated cell into an embryonic-like state it is enough to introduce certain transcription factors into culture conditions [8]. Their research showed that the use of retroviral transduction enables somatic cell reprogramming into stem cells without the need of transferring their nuclear contents into oocytes or fusing them with embryonic stem cells. Cells derived by this new method are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs; Fig. 1).",
        "Different stem cells: based on their differentiation potential stem cells can be described as totipotent, pluripotent, mulitipotent, oligopotent or unipotent [9]. Totipotent stem cells derive from an early progeny of the zygote up to the eight cell stage of the morula and have the ability to form an entire organism and the extraembryonic membranes [10, 11]. Pluripotent cells can differentiate into tissue from all 3 germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm). Multipotent stem cells may differentiate into tissue derived from a single germ layer such as mesenchymal stem cells which form adipose tissue, bone, and cartilage. Oligopotent stem cells, also called tissue-resident stem cells, can form terminally differentiated cells of a specific tissue [12]. Unipotent stem cells form a single lineage (ex. spermatogonial stem cells) [1]",
        "Since 2006 the strategies for deriving iPSCs are constantly being improved. DNA-free and viral-free protocols have been presented using recombinant proteins, messenger RNA (mRNA) and mature microRNA (miRNA) [13–15]. There has been also first attempt of in vivo reprogramming which showed that it is possible to produce totipotent iPSCs within tissues, but the technique needs major refinement before it can be used in regenerative medicine as it resulted in teratomas formation so far [16].",
        "Molecular biomarkers are used to classify and isolate stem cells and to monitor their differentiation state by antibody-based techniques. The expression of certain cell surface antigens is evidence for the cell’s potency. However, because stem cells are heterogeneous in morphology, phenotype, and function, they need to be classified into subpopulations characterised by multiple sets of molecular biomarkers [17].",
        "Human ESCs (hESCs) have flat compact colony morphology. Their growth depends on FGF and TGFb signalling. In 2007, the International Stem Cell Initiative characterised 59 hESCs lines from 17 laboratories worldwide [18]. Although the lines were not identical, presented various genotypes and were derived and maintained using different techniques, it was observed that they all exhibited similar expression patterns for several markers of human embryonic stem cells (Table 1).",
        "Human embryonic stem cell (hESCs) markers [19]",
        "Human iPSCs (hiPSCs) share all key features with human ESCs (hESCs), however there are some concerns about their molecular and functional equivalence discussed later in this article.",
        "Adult tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs), such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs usually derived from bone marrow or fat but also many other tissues [20]) are among the most studied and some are currently being used in the clinic. In 2006, the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) produced a position statement suggesting the minimum criteria required to define MSCs [21]. They must be plastic adherent, differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts in vitro and present appropriate cell surface antigens expression (Table 2).",
        "Criteria for MSCs – cell surface antigens",
        "A particular challenge for the field has been the absence of any specific marker to define MSCs, although a large number of different determinants have been associated with them but not exclusively. In vitro characterisation of MSC profiles of surface molecule expression is complicated by the fact that the culture conditions may introduce experimental artefacts. It has been proposed that certain natively expressed surface markers are modified following explantation, while new markers may be acquired [22].",
        "Although there are various stem cell sources available, there are also many controversies and doubts as to their application in regenerative medicine. For example, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been shown to increase the risk for tumour formation [23]. In addition, their culture is a demanding task, which requires continuous maintenance of the undifferentiated state for long periods of time. Their stability during extended passaging cannot be guaranteed, and recent cytogenetic studies have shown karyotypic aberrations [24]. Because ESCs are genetically different from the recipient’s cells they have the potential to generate immunological response and rejection, thereby creating the need for immunosuppressive therapy. Finally, there are many ethical issues and concerns surrounding their procurement from embryos. Thus, there are only about 300 NIH registry-approved human embryonic stem cell lines, which represents only 0.00001% of the world’s human genetic diversity (7 billion people). New methods of deriving ESCs are investigated, among them parthenogenetic ESCs [25–27] or removal of a single blastomere from a morula stage embryo (embryo biopsy) [28, 29], but still more research is needed to consider them as safe and effective protocols.",
        "Foetal stem cells are less ethically contentious than ESCs and their differentiation potential appears greater than adult stem cells [30]. They can be harvested from foetal blood and liver without harming the foetus. Some research show that they do not elicit alloreactive lymphocyte proliferation [31].",
        "Adult tissue-derived stem cells usually are less tumourogenic than their embryonic counterparts and provide an autologous source of cells eliminating concerns regarding rejection and disease transmission [32]. However, their donordependency, limited expansion potential and a highly restricted differentiation capacity are serious disadvantages [33]. When considering ASCs as a source of stem cells for regenerative therapies it must be noted that harvesting them from tissues may present some technical problems (e.g. bone marrow stem cells – painful procedure, risk of infection). To acquire an appropriate amount of MSCs, to culture them maintaining their pluripotent characteristics and then to transplant them within tissues in vivo is a challenge, because the number and quality of MSCs derived depends on the type of tissue used as a source, but also on age and sex of the donor [34–36].",
        "With iPSCs there are also many well-known technical problems that remain unresolved. Reprogramming adult cells to the embryonic stage is time consuming and requires special conditions and procedures that are not yet well established. The risk of acquiring somatic mutations and chromosomal rearrangements during the induction of pluripotency and reports of genetic and epigenetic variation between iPSC lines that were derived using identical methods are difficult issues to address [37]. The question of whether iPSCs are genuine copies of the cells that exist in vivo arises. Recent research shows that iPSCs may be significantly different from the cells found in tissues because they retain residual DNA methylation patterns typical of parental somatic cells [38, 39]. However, there are also more and more reports on effective methods of deriving footprint-free iPSCs [40–42].",
        "The cornea is a complex, multi-layered, multifunctional, transparent structure in the anterior segment of an eye that provides photo protection, refraction, and transparency and helps protect internal ocular structures [43]. It is composed of various layers, the outermost of which is the epithelium. Its stem cells are found only in the palisades of Vogt located on the periphery of the cornea, in the region known as the limbus. Thus, they are called limbal stem cells (LSCs). The limbal epithelium consists of three cell types: stem cells, transient amplifying cells (TACs) that migrate to the central cornea devoid of stem cells to regenerate it, and differentiated cells. Isolating a pure population of stem cells from the palisades of Vogt is difficult [44].",
        "Although LSCs have been the subject of research for many decades, no definitive marker has been identified so far [45]. They may be characterised as small active primitive cells that are p63, ABCG2, and integrin α9 positive and nestin, E-cadherin, connexin 43, involucrin, K3, and K12 negative, while they have a relatively higher expression of integrin β1, EGFR, K19, and enolase-α [46–48]. However, there are researchers who point out that the use of some of these markers makes it impossible to isolate and characterise live LSCs because the cells have to be permeabilised, which results in loss of cell viability. Thus, the use of RHAMM/HMMR as a negative LSCs marker for successful clinical isolation has been suggested [49]. Many other markers of LSCs are still being investigated.",
        "If the limbus is damaged, for example as a result of a chemical burn, limbal stem cells deficiency occurs (LSCD) and the cornea loses its transparency which results in blindness. If the LSCD is unilateral the autologous transplantation of limbal tissue from the uninjured eye may be performed [50]. Nevertheless, the procedure carries a risk of inducing LSCD in the donor eye due to the need of large limbal biopsy, necessitating the ex vivo expansion of LSCs as an alternative [51, 52]. It was shown that upon transplantation cultured autologous LSCs permanently restored corneal transparency of patients with ocular burns [53].",
        "New sources of LSCs and the ways of their ex vivo expansion are constantly being investigated [54]. Hayashi et al. generated corneal epithelial cells from human iPSCs by method called stromal cell-derived inducing activity (SDIA) [55]. Ouyang et al. using exogenous expression of PAX6 reprogrammed epidermal cells into LSC-like cells that were able to repair damaged corneal surface on rabbit corneal injury model [56]. They did it with a new feeder-cell-free LSCs expansion protocol. Reports from Mikhailova et al. presented direct differentiation method for iPSs toward corneal epithelial progenitor cells capable of terminal differentiation to mature corneal epithelial-like cells using 2 small-molecule inhibitors in combination with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in serum-free and feeder-free conditions [57]. Another protocol proposed by Zhao included the use of amniotic membranes as a niche for LSCs ex vivo proliferation [58]. Autologous oral mucosal epithelium graft with amniotic membrane transplantation was also proved as a viable alternative to restore corneal surfaces suffering from total limbal stem cell deficiency [59].",
        "Glaucoma is a neuropathy of the optic nerve and one of the major causes of blindness in the world population. Although its aetiology is multifactoral and not yet fully understood, it is known that the visual impairment is a result of the damage to the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). These are cells located in the innermost layers of the retina and their axons form optic nerve.",
        "Through tissue-engineering techniques various types of stem cells have been found to be a potential source of RGCs for optic nerve regeneration. Stepwise, documented differentiation of RGCs through all of the major stages of retinogenesis is crucial for determining whether cells derived in vitro from ESCs [60], ASCs, or iPSCs are truly RGCs. Appropriate physiological activity should be proven as well.",
        "Initially, RGC differentiation is triggered by fibroblast growth factors FGF3 and FGF8 released by organising centres in the optic stalk and neural retina [61]. First the axon’s formation is initiated, and then dendrites start to occur [62]. Commonly identified markers for RGCs are Brn3, Islet1, and Pax6, but they are not specific for RGCs only [63]. Thus, identifying RGCs especially derived from other sources than the retina itself requires also checking their morphological and physiological features. Morphologically RGCs possess a very elongated axon and a significant number of dendritic extensions. Several protocols have been reported for RGCs differentiation [64, 65].",
        "A very interesting source of RGCs can be Müller stem cells derived from retina. They can be harvested from a donor post-mortem and expanded in vitro as showed Limb et al. by creating an immortalized Müller cell line (MIO-M1) [66]. Cells from this line have been later transplanted into a glaucomatous rat model and expressed both neuronal and glial cell markers [67]. In another rat model, RGC precursors from the donor neural retina have been transplanted onto the inner retinal surface of rats depleted of RGCs where they integrated into tissues and continued expressing RGC’s markers in vivo [68]. These experiments demonstrated that Müller stem cells can become oriented toward the optic nerve in vivo and potentially restore RGC function in glaucomatous eyes.",
        "Among other ASCs used in optic nerve regeneration are oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs). In glaucoma there is a loss of oligodendrocytes which may play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease [69]. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells posses the ability to migrate, proliferate, and differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes and ensheath demyelinated axons in animal models [70]. By producing IGF-1 and GDNF they also enhance the survival of neurons in vitro and in vivo [71, 72]. OECs transplanted into the host eye not only secrete neurotrophic factors stimulating the survival of RGCs but also migrate and integrate into the optic nerve and promote growth of RGCs [73–75].",
        "Another research shows that ESCs injected into epiretinal space of mouse eye also efficiently integrate into the RGC layer and INL and they exhibit neuroprotective features over existing neurons [76].",
        "When it comes to iPSCs they were shown to differentiate into RGC-like cells by introducing the transcription factors Dkk1 + Noggin (DN) + DAPT and overexpression of Math5 [77]. However, they were not able to be integrated into the normal retina after transplantation.",
        "Retinal ganglion cell depletion is very often associated with increased intraocular pressure. Thus many researchers focus on regenerating trabecular meshwork (TM) which is a structure responsible for regulating the outflow of aqueous fluid from the anterior chamber of the eye and controlling intraocular pressure.",
        "Du et al. extracted stem cells from trabecular meshwork and proved their capability of differentiating into cells expressing TM markers and exhibiting phagocytic function [78]. The cells were then transplanted into aqueous fluid and migrated to trabecular meshwork renewing TM cells population within it [79]. Also Tay et al. successfully propagated in vitro MSC cells derived from TM [80]. Manuguerra-Gagne et al. showed that bone marrow-derived mouse MSC mediate regeneration of damaged TM in vivo, apparently through production of paracrine factors [81]. Abu-hassan et al. differentiated human iPSCs into TM-like cells, that upon transplantation restored partially IOP homeostasis in an ex vivo human TM cell loss model, by introduction of TM cell-derived extra cellular matrix (ECM) and TM cell-derived conditioned media in culture [82]. Ding et al. also derived TM-like cells by coculturing of mouse iPSCs with primary human TM [83].",
        "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness in older population. It is a pathology which leads to retinal pigmented epithelium cells (RPE) atrophy and loss of photoreceptors in macular region of the eye. Advanced AMD, including neovascular (wet) type and geographic atrophy (dry type), is associated with substantial, progressive visual impairment. Current treatment for wet AMD incorporates intra ocular injections of anti-VEGF agents, occasionally combined with other methods. There is no efficient treatment for geographic atrophy known. For both types of AMD regenerative medicine could contribute successful therapeutic methods.",
        "It has been demonstrated that healthy autologous RPE transplanted to macular region (using different techniques) in an early stage of AMD could partially restore vision [84–88]. However, because of the major drawbacks of these methods, such as high rate of complications and difficulties in collecting the number of RPE large enough to adequately repopulate macula, they did not contribute a satisfactory therapeutic option so far.",
        "Several defined protocols were conducted to generate mature RPE cells from ESCs. Kawasaki et al. used coculture of ESCs with PA6 stromal cells acquiring cells expressing markers of mature RPE: ZO-1, RPE65, CRALBP, and MerTK [89]. The protocol resembled the natural generation of RPE cells and avoided the potential contaminations from recombinant proteins or small molecules which were used in other protocols but was characterized by low efficiency.",
        "Other researchers investigated deriving RPE cells using mouse embryonic fibroblast cells as the feeder layer for hESCs and hiPSCs but it was shown that animal-derived components may cause unwanted immunogenicity of the generated cells because they carry factors such as sialic acid or Neu5Gc [90, 91]. As an alternative Vaajasaari et al. and Zhang et al. proposed xeno-free protocols [92, 93].",
        "RPE cells obtained through protocols presented by Meyer et al. [94] and Park et al. [95] were later tested for treatment of AMD and Stargard’s disease [96]. Also Schwartz [97] et al. is investigating safety and tolerability of subretinal injection of hESC RPE cell suspensions.",
        "Most recent researches show promising advances in applying tissue engineering methods in attempts to grow a whole organ in vitro from stem cells. Hayashi et al. presented a method of creating SEAM (self-formed ectodermal autonomous multi-zone) of ocular cells which mimics whole-eye development [98]. Human iPS cells were cultivated in differentiation medium in which they spontaneously and progressively formed a primordium comprising four identifiable concentric zones. Cell location within different zones was indicative of lineage, spanning the ocular surface ectoderm, lens, neuro-retina, and retinal pigment epithelium.",
        "Stem cells provide a variety of potential cures for many diseases as it can be illustrated on the example of an eye. There are many sources they can be derived from and currently different methods of cultivating and using those cells in regenerative medicine are being investigated. Stem cells contribute a promising treatment in the future.",

        "The health of the female reproductive system is crucial for women's quality of life and population reproduction. Anatomically, the female reproductive system comprises internal and external genitalia. In this article, the term “female reproductive system” primarily refers to the internal genitalia, located within the true pelvis, including the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina [1,2]. Diseases, medications, genetics, physical injuries, and other endogenous and exogenous factors can cause damage and dysfunction in the female reproductive system, thereby affecting women's health and fertility [3].3D bioprinting is an emerging technology that has great potential in tissue and organ construction because of its ability to precisely control the spatial,therefore, therefore,it holds the promise of facilitating breakthroughs in the treatment and research of the female reproductive system.",
        "The female reproductive system is a dynamic structure regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, where periodic hormonal changes drive corresponding changes, such as ovulation and the cyclic growth of the endometrium. Therefore, hormone therapy plays a significant role in treating conditions affecting the reproductive system [13]. For instance, estrogen therapy can promote endometrial repair, thus treating intrauterine adhesions caused by improper curettage [14]. However, the success of hormone therapy depends on the presence of target cells, as a substantial loss of these cells can limit therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, the reproductive system is susceptible to space-occupying lesions, including tumors, for which surgical intervention is often the primary treatment. In cases of malignancy, additional treatments like radiotherapy and chemotherapy are employed. However, these treatments may damage or remove reproductive organs, impacting both reproductive and endocrine functions [15]. As a result, there is a pressing need for new treatment strategies to repair damaged reproductive tissues and restore reproductive capacity. The rapid development of regenerative medicine has attracted widespread attention in female reproductive health. Current approaches include autotransplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue for women with complete ovarian loss and the use of stem cell perfusion for patients with severe endometrial damage to achieve endometrial repair and regeneration [16]. However, these strategies lack a three-dimensional structural framework for functional cells, resulting in significant cell loss and challenges in establishing long-term engraftment in the body [[17], [18], [19]]. 3D bioprinting technology can address these limitations by depositing bioinks into high-resolution scaffolds that act as temporary extracellular matrices (ECMs). This 3D structure provides a microenvironment that supports the growth and proliferation of functional cells, restricts their outward migration, and sustains therapeutic effects within the body [20]. Thus, 3D bioprinting holds broad application potential in the regenerative medicine of the female reproductive system.",
        "Currently, research on the female reproductive system's pathology and physiology relies mainly on animal and cell studies. However, genetic differences and varying metabolic pathways limit animal models' ability to replicate specific human biological processes. For instance, less than 8 % of cancer research findings from animal models advance to clinical trials [21]. Additionally, ethical concerns restrict the use of animal models. While human cells are preferred in research, traditional 2D cell cultures cannot accurately mimic the human microenvironment, such as growth conditions, cellular signaling, and interactions with neighboring cells or ECM [22]. The application of 3D bioprinting in creating 3D in vitro models offers a promising approach for studying the female reproductive system. Compared with 2D systems, 3D models demonstrate notable differences in morphology, cell vitality, proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression profiles, providing conditions closer to in vivo [23]. In studying reproductive system tumors, traditional cell culture models often cannot simulate the later stages of tumor development due to limitations in constructing complex structures and vascular networks. 3D bioprinting technology can accurately control the composition and spatial distribution of tumor-related cells and ECM components, enabling high-resolution and high-throughput creation of tumor models with complex, multi-scale structures, multiple biomaterials, and vascular networks. This is crucial for effective, patient-specific drug screening and biomedical research in reproductive system tumors. For example, cervical tumor spheroid models produced via 3D bioprinting are used to examine cell proliferation, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and the response to paclitaxel treatment. In these models, HeLa cells exhibit increased proliferation, enhanced MMP protein expression, and greater resistance to paclitaxel than traditional 2D culture models [4]. Therefore, 3D bioprinting presents valuable opportunities for constructing in vitro models of the female reproductive system, particularly for tumor modeling.",
        "In this review, we summarize the methods and materials in 3D bioprinting relevant to the female reproductive system and discuss the current applications of 3D bioprinting in tissue regeneration and in vitro model development. Finally, we address challenges and potential solutions for the future application of 3D bioprinting technology in the female reproductive system (Fig. 1).Fig. 1The main steps of 3D printing of the female reproductive system and its main applications in the female reproductive system.Fig. 1",

        "3D bioprinting technology can be understood in both broad and narrow contexts. Broadly, 3D printing that is directly related to biological applications can be classified as 3D bioprinting. In the narrow sense, however, 3D bioprinting specifically refers to the process of using 3D printing technology to manipulate living cells in order to construct biomimetic 3D tissues [24]. In this article, \"3D bioprinting\" refers to this narrower definition. The process of 3D bioprinting involves layering bioinks along a predefined path to form 3D tissues and organs with complex structures [25]. Therefore, 3D bioprinting is centered around two key components: bioink formulation and the selection of printing methods. To effectively apply 3D bioprinting to the female reproductive system, it is essential to understand the benefits and limitations of various 3D bioprinting methods and the characteristics of biomaterials used in bioinks. The following sections provide a summary of these aspects (see Table 1, Table 2).Table 1Comprehensive overview of common bioprinting techniques and its applicability in the female reproductive system.Table 13D BioprintingNozzle inner diameterprinting temperatureCell typeCell densityCell construction method and viabilityAdvantages and salient achievementsLimitations and challengesRefExtrusion-based3D bioprinting250 μm10 °CHela cells106 cells/mlCell-laden bioprinting.94.9 % ± 2.2 % after printing●Reveal that the printed 3D models have more simulated tumor characteristics compared with the 2D planar cell culture models.●That increased mechanical forces cause cellular damage and thus reduce cell survival rate.[4]100 μm30 °CFollicles of the mice40–50 folliclesDeposited follicles onto the Scaffolds.78.57 ± 3.57 %(30°)75.89 ± 4.04 %(60°)by day 8 of culture●To scale the size of the tissue to the size needed for the transplant recipient.●Investigated how scaffold pore geometry affected the growth and maturation of ovarian murine follicles as well as developed a bioprosthetic ovary that restored ovarian function.●Require optimizing the number of cells transferred to the scaffold and the assessment of durable function.[5]100 μm25 °ChiMCS106 cells/mlCell-laden bioprinting.84 % ± 4 %●That the 3D-printed hydrogel can support the long-term viability of hiMSCs in vivo and in vitro.●An excessive cell concentration not only blocks the nozzle but also prevents formation of the scaffold.●The problem of early vascularization of the 3D-printed scaffold needs to be addressed.[6]Extrusion-based3D bioprinting340 μm25 °C (the nozzle temperature)BMSCs106 cells/mlCell-laden bioprinting.>95 %●The scaffold may allow unlimited nutrition and oxygen delivery to the cells within the solid graft, which makes it possible for long-term culture in vitro.●The cells in the printed constructs may be damaged by the applied shear force when printing.●The cytotoxicity of residual chemicals in the bioink from AVM may affect cell viability.●The cell density of existing 3D printing are rough estimates.[7]Inkjet-based3D bioprinting150 μm_OVCAR-5 cells and MRC-5 cells106,2 × 106,5 × 10610 × 106 cells/ml93.8 %(OVCAR5)90.1 %(MRC-5) at 72 h post patterning●Micropatterned ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR-5) and fibroblasts (MRC-5) with spatial control.●Both OVCAR-5 and MRC-5 can be ejected with controlled number of cells per droplet maintaining high viability.The nozzle configuration restricts it to low-viscosity materials.[8]Table 2Materials used as bioink components for female reproductive system.Table 2MaterialsCrosslinking strategies of materialsCrosslinking strategies of modelPrinting methodReason for selectionApplication organizationRefGelatin/alginate/fibrino-genTemperature-induced gelation(25 °C)Chemically crosslinked(CaCl2 3 %)ExtrusionTo Simulate the natural extracellular matrix environment and to achieve both high cellular viability and a stable and clear structure.Cervical cancer model[4]GelatinTemperature-induced gelation (30 °C)Chemically crosslinkedExtrusionGelatin was selected because it is derived from collagen, an extracellular matrix protein abundant in both human and mouse ovaries,is degradable to allow for cellular remodel, contains cell adhesion sites and has soft, yet durable mechanical properties.Ovary[5]GelMABlue light crosslinkedChemically crosslinkedExtrusionGood swelling properties, degradation kinetics and shape fidelity of GelMA scaffolds were proved.Ovary[9]dECM/alginateChemically crosslinked(CaCl2)Chemically crosslinked(CaCl2)ExtrusiondECM can achieve structural remodeling by supporting the formation of specific tissue at the implanta.tion site, rather than forming poorly functional scar tissue.Vagina[8]AlginateChemically crosslinked(CaCl2)Chemically crosslinked(CaCl2)ExtrusionAlginate is commonly used and highly biocompatible,low cost,and its printing technology is mature。Cervical cancer model[10]dECM/gelatin/alginateTemperature-inducedchemically crosslinkedExtrusiondECM support a variety of cells due to their complex tissue-specifc properties and unique composition of functional components.Ovary[11]AloeVera-Sodium Alginate and PCLIn situ cross-linked_ExtrusionAV containing hydrogel can enhance the overall immunomodulatory effect of eMSCs and reduce the foreign body response to MES PCL meshes.Pelvic floor tissue[12]",

        "EBB involves continuously extruding bioink filaments through a nozzle using an air pump or screw plunger to generate pressure [26,27]. This process builds 2D patterns layer by layer to create a 3D spatial structure [28]. The advantages of EBB include high printing speed, low cost, ease of operation, repeatability, high cell density, scalability of print models, and compatibility with a wide range of biomaterial viscosities. EBB is currently the most commonly used 3D bioprinting technology for applications related to the female reproductive system [29]. When fabricating biomimetic structures of the female reproductive system, biological scaffolds loaded with functional cells are often employed. These scaffolds serve two main functions: first, to provide growth and attachment points for cells, and to present a spatial structure that allows functional cells to establish connections with the surrounding microenvironment, thereby better supporting physiological functions [30]. For example, Laronda et al. [5] used EBB to construct an artificial 3D-printing ovary by implanting exogenous follicles into a GelMA hydrogel scaffold. EBB was selected because it facilitates precise porosity in scaffolds, which in turn supports follicle attachment, vascularization, and ovulation through the scaffold pores [9]. The biological scaffold fabricated by this extrusion method meets the requirements for constructing artificial 3D ovaries. However, the EBB method still has disadvantages, such as low printing resolution and nozzle clogging when using high-viscosity bioprinting ink [[31], [32], [33]]. These issues can be addressed by adjusting the nozzle diameter and bioink viscosity [34]. In the past, hot gelatin (solution phase) was extruded onto a cold stage to induce rapid gelation in EBB applications [35,36] or cooled, fully crosslinked gel was directly extruded [37,38]. The former approach often leads to filament diffusion and poor layer resolution, whereas the latter results in blocky and uneven lines, thereby forming irregular pores. Laronda et al. [5] addressed these issues by using the thermal response characteristics of gelatin. They cooled the gelatin solution to achieve a partially crosslinked gel state and extruded it through a fine-diameter nozzle (100 mm) at 30 °C, resulting in smooth and continuous filaments and precise porosity.",
        "In addition, EBB enables the incorporation of additional injectors, allowing multiple bioinks such as methacrylate (GelMA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) loaded with various cell types to be printed, which is valuable for creating female reproductive system models with diverse cell types and complex microenvironments [39].",
        "Inkjet 3D bioprinting, also known as droplet printing, is a non-contact method that differs from EBB by producing fine droplets instead of continuous filaments. In inkjet bioprinting, a single droplet acts as the basic unit, with thermal, piezoelectric, and electrohydrodynamic mechanisms being the primary methods for droplet formation [40]. Fig. 2 shows the specific classification and process. Compared with EBB, inkjet bioprinting provides greater control over biological elements, with high resolution that makes it ideal for fabricating small-scale tissues. The resolution of the printed structures depends on the droplet size passing through the nozzle. By adjusting droplet size and density, the concentration and gradient of cells and biomaterials within the scaffold can be precisely modified [41]. In research on female reproductive system diseases, such as reproductive tumors, the growth kinetics of tumor cells (e.g., cell size and density) are closely related to the spatial structure and cell distribution density. Inkjet bioprinting can modify cell and biomaterial gradients throughout the scaffold by adjusting droplet size and density, making it highly suitable for fabricating in vitro models of female reproductive system diseases with controlled and accurate cell density distribution. For example, Xu and colleagues employed inkjet 3D bioprinting to create 3D culture models containing human ovarian tumor cells (OVCAR-5) and MRF-5 cells (normal human fibroblast cell line) to investigate tumor-stromal cell regulatory feedback mechanisms and drug sensitivity [6]. However, the principles of inkjet bioprinting limit the selection of bioinks, as the nozzle configuration restricts it to low-viscosity materials [42].Fig. 2The constituent elements of bioink.

        "Bioink typically comprises three components: biomaterials, live cells, and bioactive factors such as growth factor. Biomaterials are deposited layer by layer into a predefined 3D biomimetic structure using 3D bioprinting technology, where they serve as an ECM supporting cell attachment, migration, proliferation, and differentiation within the printed structure (Fig. 2). Biomaterials must possess both printability and cell compatibility. Printability is crucial for maintaining the shape fidelity and mechanical stability of 3D-bioprinted structures, ensuring that biomaterials can withstand the forces applied during the printing process and retain structural integrity post-printing. The compatibility between biomaterials and cells impacts cell viability, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and the eventual formation of tissue. For effective application of 3D bioprinting in the female reproductive system, selecting biomaterials for bioink formulation should align with the characteristics of the intended printed tissues and the chosen printing methods [44]. The commonly used biomaterials for 3D bioprinting in the female reproductive system are summarized below",
        "Natural polymers, which are abundant in animal, plant, and microbial tissues, offer high biocompatibility and biodegradability [45]. Currently, protein- and carbohydrate-based biomaterials are among the most commonly used natural polymers for 3D bioprinting. Protein-based biomaterials, such as gelatin and fibrin, exhibit strong biocompatibility and suitable physical properties, making them ideal for 3D bioprinting. Carbohydrate-based biomaterials, including alginate, are widely used due to their abundance, ease of acquisition, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and non-toxicity, attracting significant interest in recent years [46]. These natural polymers can form hydrogels with a three-dimensional network structure via physical or chemical crosslinking. Hydrogels, due to their high water content and resemblance to the natural ECM, are well-suited for 3D bioprinting in the female reproductive system as they protect cells during the printing process and provide a conducive microenvironment for cell growth and proliferationAdditionally, they can generally be remodeled and degraded into metabolizable compounds, such as aminoacids or carbohydrates [47,48].",
        "Hydrogels formed by gelatin and its derivatives are commonly used as biomaterials in women's 3D bioprinting.Laronda et al. [5]chose to implant exogenous follicles into gelatin hydrogel scaffolds because gelatin is an extracellular matrix protein rich in both human and mouse ovaries, when constructing an artificial 3D printed ovary [49],It is biodegradable, allows cell remodeling, contains cell adhesion sites, and has soft but durable mechanical properties [50,51].The solution gel transition point of gelatin is about 28 °C, and the gelatin bio ink can be transformed from the solution state to the gelled state by heating and cooling. When printing, the nozzle needs to be heated to melt the gelatin, so that it can appear in a flowing state, which can be extruded together with other biological materials, and then the gelatin can be transformed into a gel state at a low temperature by cooling the printing platform at the bottom to achieve shaping [52]。Laronda et al. [5] used the thermal response characteristics of gelatin to change gelatin into a partially cross-linked gel state at 30 °C, and then squeezed it through a fine diameter nozzle (100 mm) to print smooth and continuous filaments, which were finally manufactured into a scaffold structure with precise porosity. After exogenous follicles were implanted into the scaffold, ovarian follicles gradually developed and mature oocytes were produced.However, due to the insufficient mechanical properties of gelatin, its printed shape fidelity is generally average. Studies have found that mixing gelatin with alginate can increase shape fidelity and improve printing resolution [53]. Therefore, gelatin is often mixed with alginate to produce biological ink. For example, gelatin/alginate/fibrin water gel has been used to 3D print HeLa cells to build an in vitro model of cervical cancer [4].In addition to mixing with other biomaterials to increase printing fidelity, gelatin can also be chemically modified to enhance its mechanical properties. T. Wu et al. chemically modified gelatin into gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and applied it as a biomaterial for 3D biological ovarian printing. GelMA exhibited good mechanical and biocompatibility properties, not only forming regular, smooth, and clear grid scaffolds, but also gradually developing follicles after implantation, producing mature oocytes [9].",
        "Alginate (ALG) is a polysaccharide polymer extracted from natural algae such as brown algae [54]. Because the induced gel process is simple and the degradation kinetics is easy to control, it is the most commonly used biomaterial in extrusion and inkjet bioprinting [55].The composition of alginate gel is similar to that of glycosaminoglycans in extracellular matrix. It can be crosslinked with calcium ions under normal temperature, pressure and mild conditions, and quickly gel to obtain calcium alginate hydrogel. The bio ink based on alginate has good formability and mechanical properties, low toxicity, low cost, no immunogenicity, good biocompatibility, and is easy to degrade. Therefore, it is widely used in biomedical engineering [56].Alginate hydrogel loaded with human induced mesenchymal stem cells (hiMSC) has been used to repair damaged endometrium in rats by micro extrusion 3D printing technology [57].",
        "But alginate is a low viscosity fluid that requires the use of thickeners to assist in 3D bioprinting in order to maintain the integrity of its printed structure. Alginate can be combined with gelatin and hyaluronic acid to alter the printability of alginate based materials, becoming a bio ink with high viscosity and high cell viability after printing.Kallyanasis, P et al. [58] encapsulated endometrial stem cells (eMSC) with aloe sodium alginate (AV-ALG) hydrogel, and then 3D bioprinted them onto biodegradable fused melt electrospinning and polycaprolactone (PCL) grids for mechanical support for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse (POP).There are also studies [10] indicating that the printing ability of alginate solutions depends on the molecular weight and crosslinking ratio of alginate. In order to find the optimal ion pre crosslinking process, this study tested several ratios of alginate/Acl2 and obtained a bio ink with a printable ratio less than or equal to 1 (Pr ≤ 1), which means good shape fidelity and extrusiveness. Finally, the bio ink was successfully applied to construct an in vitro model of cervical cancer.",
        "Fibrin is a natural biopolymer produced through blood clotting and is an important component in the healing process of damaged tissues. Like gelatin, fibrin has excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability and can be applied in various biomedical fields such as wound healing, microencapsulated cell delivery, tissue engineering, and 3D bioprinting [59]. Silk fibroin is a natural high-molecular-weight fibrin. In a study, researchers transplanted a silk fibroin scaffold into the vagina of rats, which induced the growth of healthy tissues after implantation, indicating that silk fibroin is a suitable biomaterial for restoring female vaginal dysfunction [60]. Fibrin is also commonly used as a biological ink thickener to promote the extrusion of materials and reduce the excessive diffusion of sedimentary materials [61,62]. Zhao et al. used fibrinogen together with gelatin and alginate to make biological hydrogels to build a 3D biological external model of cervical tumors [4].",
        "dECM biomaterials have recently gained attention for their use in bioprinting. dECM materials are produced by chemically removing cellular components from tissues while preserving the ECM structure [63,64]. dECM offers a biomimetic composition of structural proteins such as collagen, elastin, and laminin and provides mechanical properties similar to those of natural tissues, making it advantageous for reproductive tissue reconstruction [65]. Decellularization reduces immune response by removing cells and antigens while preserving the ECM scaffold [66]. dECM hydrogels, formed by temperature and pH adjustments [67], offer cell growth factors and niches conducive to cell adhesion, proliferation, tissue formation, and regeneration [68]. Li et al. developed an ovarian dECM-based bioink containing adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) to enhance angiogenesis and reduce ischemic damage in follicular structures for premature ovarian failure (POI) models [11]. Additionally, Huo et al. [8] used a decellularized vaginal matrix to encapsulate bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells as bioink to construct three-dimensional vaginal tissue, which exhibited vascularization and epithelialization, suggesting that decellularized vaginal matrix induces the transformation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into vaginal epithelial cells to a certain extent.",
        "Synthetic polymers, produced by monomeric chemical reactions, are used as main components in 3D bioprinting bioinks. Synthetic polymers offer advantages such as easy synthesis, accessibility, affordability, and resilience [69]. However, due to potential bioactivity reduction from organic solvents and toxic crosslinking agents in synthetic polymer printing processes, biocompatibility may be limited [[70], [71], [72]]. As implantable biomaterials, synthetic polymers pose a risk of causing foreign body reactions and adverse immune reactions and are not easily adhered to living tissues [73]. In 3D bioprinting of the female reproductive system, synthetic polymers often play a supporting role in repairing defects in the female reproductive tract.",
        "PCL is a semi-crystalline, hydrophobic polymer with good solubility, a low melting point, and excellent compatibility. PCL's viscoelastic and rheological properties facilitate scaffold fabrication with tissue-compatible pore sizes and drug-release control. Modifying PCL's functional groups can improve hydrophilicity, adhesion, and biocompatibility. These advantages and characteristics make it potentially applicable in the field of 3D bioprinting [74]. Paul et al. [12] used endometrial mesenchymal stem cells encapsulated in hydrogel to print on PCL meshes, creating a pelvic floor implant. The study selected PCL as a biomaterial for 3D printing because it has good histocompatibility and degradability and low degradation rate. Such a slowly degraded mesh, together with endometrial stem cells, could promote tissue growth and promote tissue integration.",
        "PGA and its derivatives are polymer materials with good biocompatibility and biodegradability, possessing high mechanical properties. Their mechanical and degradation properties can be adjusted by copolymerizing with other monomers. PGA and its copolymers are widely used in biodegradable medical surgical sutures, fracture internal fixation devices, drug controlled-release carriers, and tissue engineering scaffolds [75]. Previous studies have utilized 3D bioprinting to create PGA scaffolds, which can be loaded onto rabbit vaginal smooth muscle and epithelial cells to construct vaginal tissues with phenotype and function [76,77]. To minimize the foreign body reaction of PGA biological scaffolds and facilitate better cell adhesion, De Philippo et al. [78] used 3D printing to create PGA/PLGA biological scaffolds. The scaffolds were kept under vacuum for 2 days to remove residual solvents, disinfected with ethylene oxide gas, and wetted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium for 24 h before cell inoculation. Then, labeled vaginal epithelium and smooth muscle cells were sequentially inoculated onto the inner and outer surfaces of the coated scaffolds to construct an artificial vagina.",
        "EBB is currently the most widely used technique for fabricating structures within the female reproductive system. Its key advantage is scalability, with a wide viscosity range of compatible biomaterials, such as cell-laden hydrogels and decellularized matrices, which accommodate a broad spectrum of fluid properties. High-viscosity materials provide structural support, whereas low-viscosity materials create a conducive environment for cell functionality. This broad viscosity adaptability allows EBB to incorporate high-density bioinks, achieving physiologically relevant cell densities—a principal goal in the bioprinting of reproductive tissues. However, the extrusion process introduces shear forces that can impact cell survival, particularly at high cell densities. This shear stress can be mitigated to some extent by adjusting nozzle diameter and pressure. Inkjet bioprinting technology offers high resolution and is effective for creating small-scale tissues, making it valuable for developing in vitro 3D tumor models of the female reproductive system. However, inkjet bioprinting has limitations in that it cannot print high-viscosity materials or high cell concentrations due to its lower driving force. Additionally, low-viscosity materials provide limited structural strength, reducing their suitability for subsequent in vitro culture and transplantation. Consequently, this limitation hinders the broader application of inkjet bioprinting in reproductive tissues. Both EBB and inkjet bioprinting methods also have slower print speeds and lower precision when fabricating complex structures, particularly those involving multiple biomaterials. Digital light processing (DLP) technology has recently emerged as a promising 3D printing method, offering higher resolution and faster speeds due to its surface-projection approach. This technology provides excellent uniformity and reproducibility, making it a promising candidate for developing in vitro model tissues of the female reproductive system [79]. While EBB is not yet widely applicable for reproductive tissues, it holds promise for future applications in this field. In the 3D bioprinting of the female reproductive system, hydrogels are the most commonly used biomaterial. However, hydrogels often lack sufficient mechanical strength to create tubular structures, leading to challenges with vascularization. This issue may be addressed through coaxial bioprinting, which produces core-shell structures, where the core material ensures biocompatibility, and the shell material enhances mechanical strength [80], potentially enabling vascularization within reproductive tissue models.",
        "Several biomaterials are suitable for 3D bioprinting of the female reproductive system, such as gelatin and alginate. However, single-component biomaterials often fall short in meeting all printing requirements, leading to the common practice of using multi-material bioinks. Many biomaterials can form hydrogels with three-dimensional network structures under specific physical or chemical conditions, providing a suitable microenvironment for cell adhesion, growth, and proliferation. Thus, they are ideal for 3D bioprinting applications. In selecting materials for 3D bioprinting of reproductive tissues, key considerations include printability, biocompatibility, and mechanical properties. However, these factors can conflict—for example, high-viscosity materials may have excellent printability but poor biocompatibility. Therefore, material selection should align with specific application needs, such as bioprinting.",
        "Regenerative medicine has rapidly evolved, leveraging biological and engineering principles to repair, replace, or regenerate human tissues and organs, aiming to restore their structure and function. This field holds great potential for repairing damaged organs. However, when constructing complex tissues, regenerative medicine requires precise control of cells and biomaterials, which traditional tissue engineering approaches often cannot achieve due to the difficulty in creating complex geometric shapes and layered tissue structures, which limits the application of regenerative medicine in repairing complex tissues [81,82]. 3D bioprinting technology addresses this challenge by enabling the integration, arrangement, and combination of cells, ECM, and cytokines in specific configurations, providing precise spatial control of cells and creating suitable microenvironments for cell function. This technology offers tremendous potential for constructing complex tissues and organs [83]. For women withy or endocrine dysfunction resulting from reproductive organ damage, 3D bioprinting offers a pathway to regenerative medicine. This approach allows the creation of biocompatible, biodegradable, and functional prosthetic tissues or organs [12], enabling repair or replacement of damaged tissues to restore fertility and ovarian endocrine function [84,85]. Below is a review of the various tissues and organs of the female reproductive system.",
        "The ovary is a vital organ in the female reproductive system, responsible for egg production, hormone synthesis, menstrual cycle regulation, and maintenance of female characteristics, all crucial to women's health and fertility [86]. Ovarian injury may result from various factors, including surgery, radiation, or chemical exposure, as well as genetic and autoimmune conditions, structural abnormalities, or tumors. Such injuries can lead to adverse outcomes like menstrual irregularities, premature ovarian failure, or infertility [[87], [88], [89]]. A prominent approach in regenerative medicine is autotransplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue or whole ovaries. However, this method involves risks, such as egg loss and reintroduction of malignant cells after tissue revascularization [90,91]. Previous studies have explored tissue engineering methods for artificial ovary construction; howl primary ovarian cell types—oocytes, granulosa cells, and theca cells—in a single structure presents significant challenges due to their interdependent function [92,93]. 3D printing technology provides a viable solution by enabling precise construction of complex ovarian structures, including follicles, ovarian stroma, and vascular networks, allowing for compatibility with the patient's tissues and offering a practical solution for artificial ovary fabrication [20].",
        "Laronda et al. [5] developed a 3D-printed microporous hydrogel scaffold, depositing follicles within a bioengineered ovary (Fig. 3). In vitro experiments showed that the follicles within the 3D-printed scaffold gradually matured and exhibited endocrine function, secreting hormones such as estrogen. In vivo experiments demonstrated that mice implanted with artificial ovaries could ovulate spontaneously and produce live offspring following mating. This study highlights 3D bioprinting's potential to closely mimic the ovarian microenvironment, supporting follicle growth and enabling artificial ovaries to perform reproductive endocrine functions. The innovation of this study lies in the scaffold's design, which provides appropriate depth and contact points for follicles, optimizing follicle survival and differentiation in vitro. The hydrogel scaffold's open micropores allow for sufficient space and nutrients for follicle maturation both in vitro and in vivo, facilitating vascular system infiltration post-implantation. This research suggests a promising approach for ovary bioprinting, proposing the use of multiple materials to construct structures with varying hardness and pore sizes. This approach could support both quiescent and growing follicles, achieving prolonged follicular cycles and extending implant lifespan.Fig. 3Deposition of follicles into 3D-printed microporous hydrogel to create a bioprosthesis ovary.

        "Wu et al. [9] utilized cell-laden EBB to implant exogenous follicles into GelMA hydrogel scaffolds, creating artificial 3D-printed ovaries. Compared with Laronda et al.'s prior study, this study introduces two primary distinctions: Firstly, this study explored cell-laden EBB. Initially, ovarian cancer cells were used for EBB, with results indicating that over half of the ovarian cancer cells survived after passing through a low-temperature nozzle, confirming the feasibility of cell-laden bioprinting. However, when primary cultured ovarian somatic cells were printed using the same technique, more than 90 % of the cells died, leading to the conclusion that primary ovarian somatic cells may not be suitable for cell-laden bioprinting. Nonetheless, cell survival rates are influenced by both cell density and printing conditions, suggesting that this conclusion warrants further investigation. Secondly, the study evaluated three types of hydrogels for printing 3D artificial ovaries: alginate gel, GelMA alginate gel, and GelMA hydrogel. Results showed that alginate gel was fragile and unstable. GelMA alginate saline gel formed a well-structured scaffold but exhibited low transparency, hindering clear observation of follicles. GelMA hydrogel, on the other hand, formed a smooth, well-defined scaffold structure with high fidelity. Degradation kinetics demonstrated its good biodegradability, and after implantation, follicles developed to produce mature oocytes, indicating that GelMA hydrogel is an ideal biomaterial for constructing 3D artificial ovaries. Additionally, the study found that follicles with a diameter of 100–130 μm exhibited limited growth following in vitro scaffold implantation, whereas those with diameters between 130 and 180 μm grew rapidly by day five post-implantation. This observation suggests that a major challenge in sustaining follicular cycles lies in inducing in vitro and in vivo maturation of immature follicles. The study concludes by suggesting that adding mesenchymal stem cells to 3D artificial ovaries may extend their reproductive endocrine function.",
        "As mentioned, stem cell therapy is a key approach in regenerative medicine for premature ovarian failure. Stem cells can restore ovarian function through mechanisms such as cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, autocrine and paracrine signaling, anti-inflammatory effects, gene regulation, and angiogenesis promotion. However, limitations such as insufficient cell adhesion and transient organ colonization remain challenges in stem cell therapy [[17], [18], [19]]. The use of 3D-bioprinted biomaterial composites, such as collagen scaffolds, may help overcome these limitations. On collagen scaffolds, stem cells increase survival, restrict outward migration, and support attachment and proliferation, sustaining long-term therapeutic effects [94,95]. Li et al. [11] designed an ovarian dECM-based bioink to encapsulate ADSCs and combined them with ovarian fragments to construct artificial ovaries (see Fig. 4). This study is groundbreaking in applying 3D bioprinting and stem cell therapy to treat premature ovarian failure. The dECM scaffold effectively recreated an in vivo ovarian microenvironment, enhancing the viability of ADSCs and ovarian cells and promoting necessary cell-environment interactions. ADSCs significantly stimulated neovascularization, increased blood perfusion, and reduced primordial follicle loss. This study randomly assigned rats with a POI model into five groups: (1) POI group, (2) ovarian fragments group, (3) 3D scaffold combined with ovarian fragments group, (4) ovarian fragments with ADSCs, and (5) 3D scaffold with ADSCs combined with ovarian fragments as the engineered ovary group. Normal rats served as controls. Final results showed that CM-DiI labeled ADSCs were primarily located in the ovarian stroma, with retention rates significantly higher in the 3D-bioprinted ovary group. Some regions co-stained with CM-DiI and CD31 were identified in endothelial cells in blood vessels. Additionally, the engineered ovary group displayed substantial improvements in follicle count, granulosa cell proliferation, neovascularization, and hormone levels. Improved ovarian function and angiogenesis were achieved through PI3K/AKT pathway modulation. This research highlights the promising potential of combining 3D bioprinting with other regenerative medicine technologies for the female reproductive system.Fig. 4DECM's bioink was used to encapsulate adipose-derived stem cells and construct artificial ovaries by combining ovarian fragments.

        "These advancements present new horizons for 3D bioprinting in creating artificial ovaries. From this perspective [96], 3D printing holds significant promise for in vitro follicular culture, ovarian tissue transplantation, and menopausal hormone therapy [96]. However, the ovary's complex structure and function, alongside specific reproductive hormones, highlight the need for further biomaterial development to enhance structural regeneration and functional recovery in the future.",
        "The endometrium is the inner tissue layer of the uterine cavity, primarily responsible for supporting zygote implantation and fertilization, and for sustaining embryo growth and development [97]. Structurally, the endometrium consists of two layers: the outer functional layer and the basal layer adjacent to the endometrium. The functional layer includes an outer luminal epithelium, which faces the uterine cavity, and numerous vertical glands close to the luminal epithelium. Basal cells include glandular stromal cells and a horizontally branching vascular network, which provides stem/progenitor cells essential for post-menstrual functional regeneration [98,99]. Typically, the endometrium undergoes periodic shedding and scar-free regeneration [100]; however, functional regeneration only occurs once repair is completed [101,102]. When endometrial repair is impaired, or if basal endometrial layers are damaged, as seen in endometriosis, endometrial cancer, or after curettage, repair and regeneration may be hindered [103]. Stem/progenitor cells play an essential role in endometrial repair and regeneration [104,105]. In regenerative medicine, stem or endothelial cell injections into damaged endometrial areas have been attempted to achieve tissue repair and regeneration [16]. Challenges include the normal expansion of stem cells, while the biochemical composition and physical properties of the cell matrix critically impact cell activity. Bioactive 3D-printed hydrogels with adjustable hardness closely simulate natural tissue due to their high water content, porosity, and soft consistency [47,48]. Additionally, they can regulate stem cell activity through modifiable biochemical composition or drug encapsulation [106].",
        "Ding et al. [107] constructed a collagen scaffold loaded with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) to examine its repair effects on full-thickness uterine injury in rats. Results indicated that 4 weeks post-transplantation, most BM-MSCs were located on the regenerated endometrium's basement membrane, with some cells differentiating into endometrial stromal cells. Rats receiving only collagen constructs or in spontaneous regeneration groups expressed higher levels of growth factors such as bFGF, IGF-1, TGFb1, and VEGF near damaged tissues. Endometrial tissues in rats treated with collagen/BM-MSCs also showed stronger fertility, suggesting that BM-MSCs promote the proliferation and differentiation of surrounding cells through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms, rather than directly differentiating into specific endometrial cells. This study validates the synergy of biotechnology and stem cell technology for endometrial repair. However, the collagen scaffold production method used in this study is relatively simple. Ji et al. [7] employed 3D bioprinting technology to construct a porous hydrogel scaffold loaded with hiMSC cells for endometrial repair (see Fig. 5). This study detailed the process of cell-laden EBB to create endometrial scaffolds. The results revealed that 3D-bioprinted scaffolds loaded with hiMSCs promoted endometrial tissue morphology repair (endometrial tissue and glandular regeneration), cell regeneration (stromal, epithelial, and endothelial cells), and endometrial receptivity, restoring partial embryo implantation and pregnancy maintenance functions in damaged endometria. The study suggested that active factors secreted by hiMSCs are likely critical for endometrial regeneration. However, regenerated endometrial tissue exhibited significant structural and functional differences from normal endometrial tissue. To optimize results, the study proposed methods like improving the morphology of 3D printed hydrogel, using integrin-binding agents to induce directional cell differentiation, or maturing the scaffold in a bioreactor before implantation to enhance cell survival. Early vascularization issues, often restricted by oxygen and nutrient diffusion limitations post-implantation, remain a challenge for 3D-printed scaffolds.Fig. 5Fig. 5. 3D Bioprinting a human iPSC-derived MSC-loaded scaffold for repair of the uterine endometrium.

        "Wen et al. [108] attempted to combine a 3D-printed hydrogel scaffold with a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) sustained-release microsphere system (SRM) to assess its effects on endometrial repair. In this study, both the hydrogel scaffold and the SRM system were manufactured using 3D printing technology. The hydrogel was mixed with G-CSF-SRMs, creating a G-CSF sustained-release system with precise drug distribution and personalized characteristics. Results indicated that, compared with a non-3D-printed G-CSF-SRM-loaded hydrogel, the 3D-printed sustained-release system not only enabled long-term G-CSF release in vivo but also increased the local release concentration of G-CSF. The 3D-printed active scaffold effectively reduced endometrial adhesions post-injury in an IUA rat model, promoting the reconstruction of endometrial structure and function. Although live cells were not incorporated into the 3D printing technology in this study, colony-stimulating factor—a hematopoietic factor produced by lymphocytes, activated macrophages, and endothelial cells—stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow hematopoietic cells. The SRM release system emulates the continuous release of colony-stimulating factor by cells, offering a novel application of 3D bioprinting in the female reproductive system.",
        "The vagina functions as the female sexual organ and serves as the passage for menstrual blood and fetal delivery. Its wall consists of three layers: mucosa, muscle, and fibrous tissue. The mucosa is lined with non-keratinized squamous epithelium and is highly extensible with many horizontal folds. Influenced by estrogen, it undergoes periodic changes. The muscle layer consists of two smooth layers of inner and outer longitudinal muscles, and the fibrous tissue membrane is closely adhered to the muscle layer [109]. Vaginal hypoplasia may be caused by various diseases, including Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKHS), cloacal abnormalities, endocrine disorders such as adrenal hyperplasia, and other intersex abnormalities [110]. Acquired diseases such as cancer and trauma may also lead to vaginal injury or loss [111]. In regenerative medicine, there are two common approaches for vaginal reconstruction. One approach involves surgically creating potential anatomical spaces in the pelvic cavity. However, this method lacks the muscle structure of a normal vagina and can result in chronic stenosis or graft contraction, often requiring periodic dilation. Another approach involves using self-vascularized tissue segments as vaginal structures, such as tubular muscle flaps or intestinal segments [112,113]. This method entails extensive surgery and increased risk of complications, such as excessive mucus production by intestinal segments or an elevated risk of tumors in the new vagina [114].",
        "An ideal artificial vagina should possess essential characteristics, including sufficient length, width, elasticity, and a functional vaginal axis, as well as secretion and lubrication capability to meet patients' physiological and psychological needs. It should also be minimally invasive or non-invasive, preserving other physiological functions without requiring special postoperative care [115]. As early as 2008, De Philippo et al. [78] proposed inoculating labeled vaginal epithelium and smooth muscle cells onto the inner and outer surfaces of a PGA/PLGA-coated stent to construct an artificial vagina for full vaginal replacement in rabbits. Six months post-surgery, radiographic analysis revealed a wide and unobstructed vaginal diameter without stenosis. Histological analysis confirmed well-organized epithelial and muscle cell layers, and physiological studies showed normal responses to electrical stimulation and adrenergic agonists. This study established a foundation for using tissue engineering technology in vaginal repair. Raya-Rivera et al. [116] later applied this technology in human studies. Epithelial and muscle cells from patients were cultured, expanded, and seeded onto biodegradable scaffolds to construct an artificial vagina. The artificial vagina was implanted via a perineal approach, and over an 8-year follow-up, no serious complications occurred (Fig. 6). Annual biopsies revealed a three-layer structure—matrix, epithelial cells, and muscle. A validated female sexual function index questionnaire indicated high postoperative satisfaction. However, the study had limitations, including a small participant sample and limited information on materials and 3D scaffold manufacturing. Despite these limitations, the study's human subject focus and long follow-up period offer a practical basis for tissue engineering applications in vaginal reconstruction.Fig. 6Tissue-engineered autologous vaginal organs in patients.A.Vaginal smooth muscle and epithelial cells.B.Scanning electron microscopy of scaffolds 6 days after cell seeding.C.Preoperative and postoperative MRI images.D.Tissue analyses at 1 year after surgery and at the latest yearly analyses after surgery (up to 8 years).Reproduced from Ref.

        "Hou et al. [8] utilized 3D bioprinting technology to load bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells onto decellularized vaginal matrix scaffolds. The 3D scaffold group and a 3D scaffold containing CM-Dil-labeled bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were then transplanted subcutaneously into rats. Results from HE staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence indicated that the 3D scaffold with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells significantly promoted vascularization and epithelialization in the printed vaginal tissue. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were observed to adopt phenotypes resembling vaginal epithelial cells and endothelial-like cells. This study provides a detailed overview of the materials and methods used in 3D bioprinting, offering a reference for future research. The primary innovation of this study is the use of a decellularized vaginal matrix to encapsulate bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells as bioink for constructing three-dimensional vaginal tissue. While bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are pluripotent and can differentiate in a targeted manner, inducing directed differentiation remains challenging in stem cell technology. Here, the decellularized vaginal matrix simulated the native microenvironment of bone marrow stem cells, partially inducing their differentiation into vaginal epithelium and endothelial cells. However, the regenerated epithelium was not fully mature, possibly due to an insufficient transplantation period. Another key finding was the synergistic effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and bioink on angiogenesis in the transplant structures, addressing the challenge of insufficient vascularization in 3D-bioprinted grafts.",
        "POP and stress urinary incontinence affect 30–40 % of women worldwide [117]. Current strategies for treating these conditions include non-surgical options, such as physical therapy, and surgical options, such as synthetic vaginal mesh implants. However, synthetic vaginal mesh has been associated with complications like chronic pain, infection, and mesh erosion [118,119], possibly due to its non-degradable nature, poor tissue integration, and long-term inflammation [120]. Thus, there is an urgent need for biodegradable implants that promote tissue fusion and reduce inflammatory responses, providing reinforced support for pelvic floor tissues. With advancements in 3D bioprinting, some studies have explored using endometrial mesenchymal stem cells encapsulated in hydrogel with a poly-ε-caprolactone network for 3D-printed pelvic floor implants (Fig. 7). After implanting these constructs into mice, acute in vitro and in vivo evaluations in NSG mice showed that the endometrial mesenchymal stem cells in the implant were preserved and contributed to tissue integration. M2 macrophages were observed to exert anti-inflammatory effects on the implant. This study demonstrates that 3D-bioprinted implants loaded with endometrial mesenchymal stem cells have potential as a degradable alternative to synthetic mesh for treating pelvic prolapse disorders [12].Fig. 73D-bioprinted endometrial stem cells on melt electrospun poly-caprolactone mesh for pelvic floor application.

        "The cervix is located at the lower end of the uterus. The functions of the cervix mainly include connecting the uterus to the vagina, protecting the uterus, secreting mucus, participating in the reproductive process, having immune functions, and sensing stimuli. Its tissue is primarily composed of connective tissue. However, pathological changes in the cervix, such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer, may require the removal of part or all of the cervical tissue [121].Annachiaraet al. [122]developed competent three-dimensional connective tissue equivalents (e.g. skin, gut, cervix)(see Fig. 8).They developed a two-step bottom-up strategy that involves the dynamic assembly of microtissue precursors (μTPs) to create macroscopic functional tissues composed of cell-secreted extracellular matrix (ECM). Notably, the application of μTPs in 3D bioprinting is highly innovative. μTPs fuse and self-assemble to form larger tissues more rapidly than individual cells. Additionally, the use of 'sacrificial' bioinks enables scaffold-free bioprinting. Simultaneously, they employed an extrusion-based bioprinting technique, embedding the building blocks within a matrix to dispense microtissues of various sizes using nozzles with different diameters. Histological, immunofluorescence analysis, and second harmonic generation reconstruction revealed an increase in endogenous collagen and fibronectin production within the bioprinted construct, closely mimicking the composition of native connective tissues.Fig. 8Bioprinting of in vitro connective tissue.

        "Due to ethical concerns surrounding the use of human subjects in biomedical research [123] most basic research utilizes in vivo animal models and 2D cell/tissue culture models to study the female reproductive system [124]. However, the complexity and species-specific differences in the female reproductive system make direct comparisons with animal models challenging. Additionally, reproductive organs in the human body do not function in isolation; they are interconnected with other organs to maintain reproductive and endocrine functions. Single-layer cells cultured on flat plastic or glass lose their three-dimensional structure and physical or biochemical interactions with other cells in the body [125]. These limitations highlight the urgent need for structural models that accurately replicate the physiological microenvironment of the human female reproductive system. The three-dimensional distribution of cells in 3D-bioprinted in vitro models more closely resembles the in vivo situation, better simulating cell–cell and cell–ECM interactions within the female reproductive system. Particularly in research on tumors of the female reproductive system, 3D-bioprinted in vitro models can replicate tumor heterogeneity and its relationship with the microenvironment, providing a foundation for studying tumor pathology and screening potential drugs [126]. Below is a review of research on 3D bioprinting for constructing models of female reproductive system tumors and other pathological or physiological conditions.",
        "Cervical cancer is the third most common malignant tumor among women worldwide [125]. It can be classified into three pathological types: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous cell carcinoma [[127], [128]]. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV is the primary risk factor for cervical cancer, with over 90 % of cases associated with high-risk HPV infection [129]. Surgical treatment is the standard approach for early-stage cervical cancer, and synchronous radiotherapy and chemotherapy are performed for patients with high risk of recurrence pathological factors after surgery; There is no consensus on adjuvant therapy for patients with intermediate risk factors, and Sedlis criteria are commonly used in clinical practice. The standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer is concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy, with a cure rate of up to 60 %. Despite standard treatment, 30 % of patients still experience local recurrence or metastasis, resulting in a low survival rate and being the main cause of death at present. The treatment options for advanced or recurrent cervical cancer remain limited, with poor prognosis posing a significant challenge in cervical cancer treatment [128].",
        "In 2014, Zhao et al. [4] constructed an in vitro cervical tumor spheroid model with tumorigenic properties using a gelatin/fibrinogen/alginate hydrogel loaded with HeLa cells via EBB (Fig. 9). This model was used to study cell proliferation, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and responses to paclitaxel treatment. Compared with traditional 2D culture models, HeLa cells in the 3D model showed enhanced proliferation, migration abilities, and higher paclitaxel resistance. This study pioneered the use of 3D bioprinting to construct a cervical cancer model in vitro and comprehensively compared 2D and 3D cervical cancer models concerning cell proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance, demonstrating that the 3D model effectively mimics in vivo tumor characteristics. Additionally, the study provides detailed insights into constructing an in vitro cervical cancer model using 3D bioprinting, establishing a theoretical and practical foundation for this technology's application in cervical cancer tumor biology research.Fig. 9Three-dimensional printing of HeLa cells for cervical tumor model in vitro.

        "In 2018, a study [130] based on Zhao et al.'s methods developed a model of advanced cervical cancer using a gelatin/fibrinogen/alginate hydrogel loaded with HeLa cells. Upon TGF-β supplementation, HeLa cells aggregated and began to disassemble, with some cells acquiring fibroblast-like spindle morphology, indicating induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The addition of disulfuron and EMT pathway inhibitor C19 inhibited TGF-β-induced EMT in a dose-dependent manner. This study demonstrated TGF-β′s role in inducing EMT within a 3D-bioprinted cervical cancer model, offering a theoretical basis for research on cervical cancer metastasis and treatment.",
        "In 2023, another study [10] used 3D bioprinting to investigate spatial gradients of HeLa cell concentration in high-resolution cervical tumor models. SECM was employed to quantitatively measure drug molecule diffusion over time in the 3D cervical cancer tumor structure. EBB with alginate as the bioink provided the basis for the model, with alginate's printability being influenced by its molecular weight and crosslinking ratio. The study detailed the preparation of biocompatible and printable alginate solutions and optimized conditions to ensure bioink consistency and model fidelity. Using SECM, the study spatially resolved oxygen concentrations within HeLa cell spheroids, leveraging nanoelectrodes and phase-contrast microscopy. Since oxygen levels critically regulate cellular processes and significantly influence cellular behavior under both physiological and pathological conditions, this technique provides valuable insights into how oxygen concentration affects cervical cancer cells. Additionally, SECM has the potential to investigate the spatial distribution of cellular metabolites within spheroids. By evaluating drug penetration and distribution within 3D-bioprinted models, SECM can simulate anti-cancer compound diffusion in tumor clusters, aiding in drug efficacy studies for cervical cancer.",
        "Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among gynecological tumors, posing significant threats to women's health and life [131]. Most cases (70 %) are diagnosed at late stages because the clinical manifestations of early ovarian cancer are relatively insidious and non-specific In recent years, although significant progress has been made in the treatment and research of ovarian cancer, the lack of early diagnosis and the occurrence of postoperative chemotherapy resistance have limited improvements in the 5-year survival rate for patients with ovarian cancer [132].",
        "The demand for individualized models in ovarian cancer treatment and the development of precision therapies have promoted the creation of 3D-bioprinted tissue models. Xu et al. employed an inkjet-based 3D bioprinting method to print human ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR-5) and MRF-5 cells (a normal human fibroblast cell line) in a controlled spatial distribution atop a Matrigel matrix scaffold, creating a 3D culture model to study the regulatory feedback mechanisms between tumors and matrix cells, as well as for drug sensitivity testing [6].",
        "Baka et al. [133] used a gelatin-alginate saline gel loaded with ovarian cancer cells (SKOV-3) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) for 3D bioprinting to develop an in vitro model of ovarian tumors. In this model, it was observed that cells self-assemble into heterotypic aggregates, which can be utilized to construct ovarian cancer organoids. Mekhileri et al. [134] created a macroscale ovarian model by assembling a 3D-printed hydrogel scaffold into a heterogeneous spheroid containing ovarian adenocarcinoma cells and fibroblasts (Fig. 10). Compared with a single spheroid module, the increase in size and complexity of tumors leads to a decrease in sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. These results indicate that the planar culture model cannot accurately simulate the impact of the physiological microenvironment on drug pharmacokinetics after losing the three-dimensional structure of normal in vivo tissues. Therefore, when comparing 3D-bioprinted organoids with 2D cultures, organoid models exhibit resistance to chemotherapy drugs.Fig. 10Construction of 3D in vitro model of ovarian cancer. A.

        "The application of 3D bioprinting in drug screening enhances physiological relevance by creating three-dimensional tissue models that closely mimic the in vivo environment. Therefore,3D-bioprinted cervical and ovarian cancer tumor models have been successfully used to study tumor occurrence and cell response to clinically relevant chemotherapy drugs. This novel in vitro bioprinted tumor model exhibits 3D biological features, making it an important tool for studying 3D tumor biology.This advancement is poised to improve the efficiency and accuracy of high-throughput drug screening. Additionally, it enables personalized drug screening, providing strong support for personalized medicine.",
        "Endometriosis is a common disease that affects 178–200 million women worldwide. It refers to the growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity, often invading structures within the pelvic cavity, including the peritoneum, ovaries, bladder, small intestine, and colon. The main clinical manifestations of endometriosis are chronic pelvic pain and infertility [135,136].The lack of representative in vitro models of endometriosis hinders research in this field. In a 2020 study [137], 3D bioprinting was used to create a three-dimensional biological model of frameless endometriosis using the 12Z endometrial cell line and a phosphate matrix, employing the Kenzan method (Fig. 11). This model expresses high levels of estrogen-related genes and secretes a significant amount of inflammatory factors associated with endometriosis, independent of TNFα stimulation. Additionally, the study constructed a 3D construct with 12Z cells in the periphery and HeyA8 cells in the core, which can be used to investigate the pathogenesis of endometriosis-related ovarian cancer. Furthermore, this study attempts to construct a biosphere using endometrial stromal cells (T-HESCs) and 12Z cells to explore the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Although the 12Z cell line used originates from peritoneal lesions and cannot fully represent the various molecular forms of endometriosis, this biological model is still expected to serve as a conceptual validation basis for studying endometriosis and its microenvironment.Fig. 11Three-dimensional biofabrication models of endometriosis.

        "The uterine muscle layer is the main tissue structure responsible for uterine contractions, which are crucial for various reproductive functions, such as the menstrual cycle, transportation of sperm and embryos, pregnancy, and childbirth [138,139]. Dysregulation of uterine contractility can lead to common pathological diseases, including premature birth, infertility, implantation abnormalities, and irregular menstrual cycles [[140], [141], [142]]. Uterine contractility is a three-dimensional coordinated phenomenon that should be studied in a three-dimensional environment. Souza et al. [143] used 3D bioprinting for the first time to print uterine muscle cells from different patient sources into 3D-bioprinted hollow rings, which can be used to study the physiological mechanisms of uterine contractility and the effects of various clinically relevant drugs, such as nifedipine and indomethacin, on uterine contractions.",
        "3D bioprinting technology holds significant potential for applications in the repair and regeneration of the female reproductive system. However, challenges remain, such as insufficient vascularization in printed tissues and structural and functional discrepancies compared with natural tissues. Addressing these issues requires feasible approaches, including optimizing 3D printing techniques, identifying biocompatible materials suitable for bioprinting, and selecting appropriate cell types and bioactive factors.",
        "When integrating 3D bioprinting with stem cell technology for regenerative medicine in the female reproductive system, a key issue is how to induce the directed differentiation of stem cells. 3D bioprinting provides favorable growth conditions for stem cells, facilitating their interaction with the surrounding microenvironment. Furthermore, with advancements in bioprinting materials, such as the development of dECM, it is now possible to create specific physiological and biochemical environments for various cell lines, enriched with growth factors and stem cell niches. This environment supports cell adhesion and proliferation and can, to some extent, induce the directed differentiation of stem cells, thereby promoting tissue formation and regeneration.",
        "3D-bioprinted tumor models for cervical and ovarian cancers have already been successfully employed in studying tumor pathogenesis and drug screening. These 3D-bioprinted tumor models exhibit unique three-dimensional biological characteristics, making them valuable tools for studying tumor biology in a 3D context. However, in vitro tumor experiments often lack the regulatory influences of other human systems. The female reproductive system, consisting of several organs interconnected through complex endocrine pathways and communication mechanisms, poses additional challenges. Consequently, simple in vitro 3D models may yield outcomes that differ from in vivo conditions. \"Organ-on-a-chip\" technology offers a promising solution by leveraging microfluidics and 3D cell culture techniques to create biologically active organ models on microchips. 3D bioprinting can provide precise spatial structures for three-dimensional cell cultures, while microfluidic systems can better simulate the in vivo microenvironment. Integrating different organs onto a single biochip could enable the creation of more realistic models that closely mimic the physiological or pathological conditions of the female reproductive system, providing a powerful tool for research in this field.",
        "Given the current applications of 3D bioprinting in the female reproductive system, there is potential to explore its use in female fertility preservation. Presently, the primary techniques for fertility preservation in women include embryo freezing, oocyte freezing, and ovarian tissue freezing. Among these, embryo freezing is the most effective but is only suitable for married women. For women without a partner or for prepubescent girls, oocyte freezing and ovarian tissue freezing are the only available options. However, oocyte freezing often faces limitations due to the patient's condition, making it difficult to obtain mature oocytes. While immature oocytes can be matured in vitro, the normal development and blastocyst formation rates of embryos derived from in vitro-matured oocytes are lower than those of embryos derived from in vivo-matured oocytes. 3D bioprinting could offer a solution by constructing implants that combine immature oocytes with biomaterials, allowing these oocytes to mature in vivo and thereby increasing the chances of natural conception for such patients.",
        "As for ovarian tissue freezing, a common issue is the significant reduction in the number of primordial follicles due to hypoxia during tissue thawing and transplantation. 3D bioprinting can address this by using biomaterials to load ovarian tissue and relevant bioactive factors to construct 3D-structured implants. These implants could facilitate better nutrient exchange between the ovarian tissue and the surrounding environment, reducing hypoxia and improving the survival rate of primordial follicles within the ovarian tissue.",
        "3D bioprinting still faces challenges in fully meeting the demands of the female reproductive system. It is important to recognize that other areas of biological research are also advancing toward the creation of multicellular systems, such as organoids, which address the critical need for microenvironments defined by specific cellular interactions. Moreover,3D bioprinting is confronted with a host of ethical issues, including disputes over the sourcing and utilization of cells, the ethical balance in clinical applications and trials, risks of technological misuse, and challenges regarding intellectual property rights and regulation.Aditionally, bioprinting technology must achieve scalability and integrate innovatively with additional biofabrication methods. However, interdisciplinary collaboration may increase labor costs, and the materials and equipment typically used in 3D bioprinting are often expensive.Consequently, the development of low-cost hardware and improved accessibility are further necessary to advance its application in the field of the female reproductive system.",

        "p53 is referred to as “the guardian of the genome”, because it maintains genomic stability by arresting proliferation of cells with damaged DNA, thus minimizing the risk of tumor development by maintaining a pool of healthy cells [1]. Nevertheless, p53 is not essential for embryonic development. Mice nullizygous for p53 (p53-/- mice) do not die until they succumb to tumors as adults [2,3,4]. Moreover, the p63 and p73 homologs of p53 also are not essential for development, and they are not functionally redundant with p53 [5]. Therefore, the p53 family of proteins is not essential for mammalian development.",
        "In differentiated cells, p53 operates primarily through transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 to prevent cells from entering S-phase, and the pro-apoptotic proteins PUMA and NOXA/PMAIP1 [6,7] to activate the rapid induction of apoptosis when the effects of cell stress are too great to be reversed. Remarkably, neither p21 nor PUMA are required for mouse development. p21-/- mice develop spontaneous tumors at an average age of 16 months, whereas wild-type mice are tumor-free beyond 2 years of age [8]. Puma-/- mice recapitulate virtually all of the apoptotic deficiencies in p53-/- mice [9].",
        "Over half of all human tumors express a mutated p53 in which the mutation down-regulates p53 activity. Inactivation of the p53 gene leads to three hallmarks of cancer: genomic instability, metastasis, and drug-resistance [10]. Restoration of wild-type p53 protein can result in tumor regression and prolonged mouse survival [11]. Besides mutations in the p53 gene, loss of p53 activity can also result from epigenetic silencing, from disruption of pathways that activate p53 in response to DNA damage, from viral proteins that impair p53 activity, and from up-regulation of MDM2 expression [12,13,14,15,16,17].",
        "In response to cellular stress such as inhibition of DNA replication or mitosis, double-strand DNA breaks, changes in the oxidative state, ribonucleotide depletion, or oncogene activation [18], p53 activates transcription of genes involved in many different events. These include maintaining genomic stability by inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or senescence [19,20,21], regulating homeostasis and metabolism [22], regulating pluripotency and differentiation [23,24], triggering inflammation [25], reducing reproduction [26], regulating aging [27], and stimulating tissue regeneration [28]. Recent evidence indicates that p53 also has a role in enabling cells to adjust their metabolism in response to changes in glucose and other nutrient levels, oxygen availability, and reactive oxygen species [29,30]. Consequently, p53 has been reported to induce expression of hundreds of different genes that affect viability [31].",
        "Analysis of 3661 p53 target genes gleaned from multiple sources concluded that only 343 are p53 target genes with high-confidence [32]. This represents an 11-fold reduction in the number of p53 target genes reported in the literature and suggests that p53 targets about 1.6% of the approximately 21,000 human protein coding genes [33]. These high-confidence p53 target genes function in multiple processes (Figure 1).",
        "The nature of the phenotypic response to p53 activation is generally proportionate to the amplitude, duration, and nature of the activating signal [18]. Severe stress induces apoptosis and senescence, whereas milder stress leads to a transient growth arrest coupled with an attempt to deal with the cause of stress and repair the damage caused by it.",
        "Mammalian development begins when an egg is fertilized by a sperm to produce a 1-cell embryo termed the zygote [34,35]. The zygote then undergoes a series of cell cleavage events to produce a blastocyst that implants into the uterine endothelium to produce an embryo (Figure 2). The 1-cell to 8-cell embryos consist of totipotent blastomeres encapsulated by a thick transparent membrane termed the zona pellucida. Totipotent cells can develop into a new organism; they can give rise to both the placenta and the embryo. Pluripotent cells can become any type of cell in the body, as exemplified by embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Multipotent stem cells can differentiate into two or more distinct cell types.",
        "During the 8-cell to 32-cell stage of development, the blastomeres develop cell-to-cell adhesion, and the outer blastomeres differentiate into the multipotent trophectoderm while the remaining blastomeres form the pluripotent inner cell mass. The epithelial trophoblast cells (trophectoderm) give rise only to cells required for implantation and placentation, whereas the inner cell mass of the blastocyst (recognized upon formation of a blastocoel cavity) differentiates into the pluripotent epiblast and the multipotent primitive endoderm. Following implantation of the blastocyst into the uterine membrane, the primitive endoderm differentiates into multipotent visceral and parietal endoderm that give rise to internal layers of various organs. The other two multipotent primitive cell layers are derived from the epiblast. Primitive mesoderm gives rise to muscle and blood cells, whereas primitive ectoderm gives rise to skin and neuronal cells.",
        "p53 transcripts have been detected at low levels throughout mammalian development. In mice, transcripts from genes involved in programmed cell death (Trp53, Pdcd4, Bad, Bax, Bcl2l1, and Bcl2) are present from the 1-cell embryo through the blastocyst stage with greatest number of p53 transcripts/embryo in blastocysts [37]. Later studies in humans quantified the number of TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, RB1, MAD2, BUB1, APC and ACTB transcripts/embryo/cell from oocytes through blastocysts [38]. The average number of p53 transcripts/embryo was 141 in oocytes, 51 in 2–4 cell embryos, 72 in 5–10 cell embryos, and 1120 in blastocysts; the number of p53 transcripts/cell was 21, 14, 8 and 14, respectively. Thus, the number of p53 transcripts per cell is comparatively constant during preimplantation development.",
        "From zygote to adult, genes involved in cell proliferation and programmed cell death are expressed at varying levels in virtually every cell [39]. All cells express p53 transcripts until 10 days post-coitum, but at later stages in development, only specific differentiating tissues showed high levels of expression. Terminally differentiated tissues exhibited very low levels of p53 mRNA, suggesting a strong correlation between p53 levels and the fraction of embryonic cells undergoing proliferation or differentiation.",
        "In mouse embryonic stem cells and early embryos, p53 restricts expression of the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b while up-regulating Tet1 and Tet2, which promote DNA demethylation. Hence, p53 helps maintain DNA methylation homeostasis and clonal homogeneity, a function that may contribute to its tumor suppressor activity [40]. Despite the fact that p53 is not essential for mammalian development, p53-/- embryos can display developmental phenotypes [41]. Depending on their genetic background, some p53-/- embryos exhibit exencephaly [42,43], defects in eyes and teeth [43,44,45], and reduced pregnancy rates and litter sizes that result from decreased uterine levels of LIF interleukin-6 [46]. These effects reflect the fact that, although the p53 protein is largely inactive in stem cells, when activated, p53 helps to commit these cells to developmental lineages through a series of epigenetic changes [7].",
        "Although much has been learned, questions still remain unresolved due largely to two facts: (1) p53 affects expression of hundreds of different genes required to maintain cell viability. (2) p53 is not essential for mammalian development. Therefore, the question is not whether p53 is required for a specific event to occur during development, but whether or not p53 contributes significantly to that event.",
        "When does p53 activity first appear during mammalian development? Does p53 affect genomic stability in embryonic cells as it does in adult cells? Does p53 help maintain a pluripotent state? Does p53 facilitate apoptosis or cell differentiation?",
        "Presumably, p53 maintenance of genomic stability and induction of the WNT signal transduction pathway require p53-dependent transcription of specific genes. Thus, the question arises as to when p53-dependent transcription become significant during embryo development.",
        "Transgenic mice in which ectopic expression of a EGFP reporter gene is driven by a p53-dependent response element from either the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Cdkn1a/p21 or the pro-apoptotic p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis Bbc3/Puma promoter demonstrate that p53 transcriptional activity exists as early as late stage blastocysts and early post-implantation epiblast [47] (Figure 3). Furthermore, double-strand DNA breaks introduced by X-irradiation of embryos at either E3.5 (blastocysts) or E9.5 (organogenesis) revealed that p53+/+ embryos die more frequently than p53-/- embryos, whereas p53-/- embryos exhibit more developmental anomalies [48]. X-irradiated p53+/+ embryos undergoing organogenesis contain a greater number of apoptotic cells than p53-/- embryos. p53 appears to facilitate apoptosis in response to double-strand DNA breaks induced by X-irradiation of mouse embryos, but only after they developed to late stage blastocysts (E5) [49]. No significant change in cell proliferation was observed following X-irradiation, but wild-type blastocysts exhibited 2 to 3-times more apoptotic cells than p53-/- blastocysts. Apoptosis, defined as TUNEL-positive DNA-positive cell fragments, occurred primarily in the inner cell mass. Thus, p53 transcriptional activity and DNA damage is evident as early as the late blastocyst stage and increases during organogenesis.",
        "Nevertheless, p53-dependent transcription of endogenous genes in ESCs is suppressed by multiple mechanisms. The bulk of p53 protein is localized to the cytoplasm in naïve ESCs, and p53 activity is maintained at low levels by MDM2 [50,51,52]. SIRT1 prevents translocation of cytoplasmic p53 to the nucleus [53], and AURKA inactivates p53 by phosphorylating it [54].",
        "This apparent contradiction between ectopic EGFP expression and endogenous gene expression reflects the fact that the number of transcripts produced from the EGFP reporter gene, and the number of transcripts produced from the endogenous p21 and Puma genes were not determined. Thus, the simplest explanation is that endogenous p53-dependent transcription at the beginning of mouse development is low in pluripotent embryonic cells compared with differentiated embryonic cells, in which case the primary role of p53 is to facilitate the transition from a pluripotent state to a differentiated state. In support of this hypothesis, ESC differentiation responds to changes in the cellular level of p53. In wild-type ESCs, the MDM2 specific inhibitor nutlin induces ESC differentiation as a consequence of p53 activation, p21 up-regulation and cell cycle arrest [55,56].",
        "Under normal conditions, p53 expression is very low; it is a short-lived protein whose stability and activity are regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation and acetylation that are critical for p53 activation, and by association with specific p53 regulatory proteins such as MDM2 and MDM4/MDMX [57,58,59]. MDM2 is a p53 target gene that encodes a ubiquitin ligase that mediates degradation of p53, thereby creating a feed-back loop that regulates p53 activity. MDM4 Inhibits p53 by binding to its transcriptional activation domain. MDM4 can reverse MDM2-targeted degradation of p53 while maintaining suppression of p53 transactivation and apoptotic functions. In addition, the ‘retinoblastoma-binding protein’ RBBP6/PACT [60,61,62] and the ‘protein activator of interferon induced protein kinase EIF2AK2’ PRKRA/RAX/PACT [63,64] have been reported to regulate p53 activity.",
        "Gastrulation occurs from E6.25 to E9.5 wherein the epiblast gives rise to the embryo proper through differentiation into the three primary germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm [65]. p53 activity is suppressed in mice until post-implantation development by virtue of the interaction between p53 and MDM2, MDM4 and PACT/RBBP6 [57,61]. Inactivation of the MDM2, MDM4 or PACT/RBBP6 gene in mouse embryos results in lethality, but only in the presence of p53 protein. For Mdm2-/- embryos, demise occurred after implantation of the embryo in the wall of the uterus but before day 7.5 of gestation (taken as E5.5) [66,67]. Furthermore, the presence or absence of normal physiologic levels of Mdm2 in embryonic fibroblasts isolated from 12 to 14 day old embryos has no effect on the growth or tumorigenic potential of p53-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, indicating that Mdm2 does not have a p53-independent role in regulating cell proliferation [68,69]. For PACT/RBBP6-/- embryos, lethality after implantation but before E7.5 [61]. For MDM4, lethality occurs between E7.5 and E12 [70,71,72]. All three phenotypes were rescued by transferring the mutated p53 negative regulator gene to a p53-nullizygous mouse background, in which case mice develop normally. Thus, embryonic death in the absence of MDM2, MDM4 or PACT/RBBP6 results from activation of p53 protein.",
        "p53 activity is first detectable during the late blastocyst stage and confined primarily to pluripotent cells. However, p53 expression is too low to induce either cell cycle arrest or cell death upon release from post-translational regulation by MDM2 or PACT/RBBP6 until after the blastocyst has implanted (E4.5) and gastrulation has begun (E6.25-E7.5, Figure 2). However, DNA damage begins to accumulate in Mdm2-/- blastocysts, but less so in embryos that are null for both Mdm2 and the p53-dependent pro-apoptotic gene Bax, suggesting that unregulated p53 can initiate apoptosis in blastocysts that is not lethal until gastrulation [73]. Nevertheless, in the absence of both MDM2 and BAX proteins, embryonic lethality still occurs during E6.5-E7.5, due to arrest of cell proliferation (presumably senescence). In contrast, Mdm4-/- embryo lethality results simply from p53-dependent arrest of cell proliferation (presumably senescence) [70,71,72].",
        "The earliest demonstration of p53-dependent maintenance of genomic stability occurs during embryonic stem cell proliferation when p53 prevents accumulation of polyploid and aneuploid cells [74]. Aneuploidy is a hallmark of cancer [10]. In the absence of p53, polyploid and aneuploid cells arise during the 21 days required for gestation in mice. However, only a fraction of these cells will produce a cancer, thereby accounting for the fact that p53-/- mice do not die until they succumb to tumors as adults.",
        "Tetraploidy is a precursor to polyploidy and polyploidy leads to aneuploidy [75]. Tetraploidy is an aberrant event that results from endoreplication (multiple S-phases without an intervening mitosis), cytokinesis failure, or mitotic slippage. When that occurs, wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts or human fibroblasts are arrested in G1 phase with 4N DNA content, whereas p53-/- cells re-enter the cell cycle and initiate another round of DNA replication [76,77]. p53-dependent cell cycle arrest requires the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. The same effects are also observed with human fibroblasts, except that tumor suppressor ‘retinoblastoma transcriptional corepressor 1’ (RB1) also plays a role. Thus, the p53 dependent checkpoint following disruption of the mitotic spindle functionally overlaps with the p53-dependent checkpoint following DNA damage. In addition, p53 loss dysregulates the spindle assembly checkpoint by up-regulating MAD2, which increases chromosome missegregation and tetraploidization [78]. In the context of tetraploid cells, p53 loss leads to an increased rate of multipolar mitoses and subsequent chromosome missegregation [79]. Consequently, loss of p53 drastically accelerates tumor development in aneuploid cells [80].",
        "Teratomas are solid tumors composed of differentiated cells derived from all three primary germ layers [81]. Both p53+/+ and p53-/- mouse ESCs produce teratomas at ectopic sites [82,83]. During self-renewal, p53-/- ESCs develop a high incidence of karyotype abnormalities [82], and although they retain their ability to contribute to normal development in chimeric embryos, p53-/- ESCs exhibit defects during differentiation [84]. Thus, p53 is not required for ESC differentiation, because both p53+/+ and p53-/- mouse or human ESCs can differentiate in vitro [82,85]. However, p53 does act as a ‘guardian of the genome’ by inhibiting ESCs with abnormal karyotypes from proliferating. Fibroblasts isolated from p53-/- mouse embryos and then cultured in vitro readily accumulate aneuploid cells [86]. The absence of p53 is not sufficient to cause aneuploidy in vivo, although cells without p53 are prone to accumulate abnormal chromosomes after oncogene activation [87].",
        "In the absence of detectable p53 transcriptional activity prior to the appearance of embryonic stem cells, p53 begins its role as ‘guardian of the genome’ during the late blastocyst stage and continues to the adult.",
        "The role of p53 in maintaining a pluripotent state was first suggested by the fact that p53 gene expression is greater in cells derived from 10–14 days old mouse embryos than in cells derived from 16 days old mouse embryos [88]. Subsequent studies confirmed that expression of p53 was high in naïve ESCs [50], downregulated during embryogenesis [88,89], and virtually absent in terminally differentiated cells [90]. More recently, pifithrin-α (PFT-α), an inhibitor of p53-dependent transcription, inhibited cell number, colony size, cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis in ESCs, suggesting that in the absence of stress, p53 is required for ESC self-renewal [91]. However, PFT-α inhibition of transcription is highly dependent on the p53 target gene selected, and PFT-α is not an effective antagonist of p53 activation by nutlin inhibition of Mdm2 [92].",
        "The pluripotent state is currently attributed to expression of 10 essential transcription factors in human and mouse ESCs [93,94,95,96,97]. They are the ‘core genes’ Pou5f1p5/Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, along with Tcf3/E2a, Klf4, Myc/c-Myc, Esrrb, Sall4, Tbx3, and Stat3. Remarkably, only Nanog and Myc are among the 343 genes considered to be regulated directly by the p53 transcription factor [32], and both are down-regulated by p53 [23,24,98]. Therefore, if p53 facilitates maintenance of the pluripotent state, it does so indirectly.",
        "In both ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), p53 activity is maintained at low levels through post-translational modifications by ubiquitylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation or sumoylation of specific residues in p53 protein [99]. For example, ubiquitylation by MDM2 and TRIM24 maintain low levels of p53 in human ESCs [100]. Phosphorylation of p53 by AURKA at S212 and S312 inhibits differentiation of ESCs [54]. Deacetylation of p53 at K373 by the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 inhibits nuclear p53 activity [101].",
        "Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs), >200 nucleotides with poly-adenylated tail but without an open reading frame, are highly expressed in human pluripotent ESCs [102,103]. Repression of LncRNAs promotes ESC differentiation [102]. More than 40 LncRNAs are expressed in human ESCs, and they are regulated by p53 to maintain a balance between pluripotency and differentiation.",
        "For example, the LncRNAs termed lncPRESS1 and lncPRESS2 maintain pluripotency whereas the LncRNA termed HOTAIRM1 promotes differentiation [104]. lncPRESS1 prevents chromatin localization of SIRT6, which results in histone acetylation at H3K56 and H3K9 at the promoters of core pluripotency genes, thereby maintaining their transcription [104]. In human ESCs, H3K56 acetylation is associated the transcriptional activation of core pluripotency genes [105]. lncPRESS4, also known as TUNA (Tcl1 upstream neuron-associated or linc86023), is required for maintenance of pluripotency by directly binding to the promoters of the Nanog, Sox2 and Fgf4 genes [106].",
        "Under stress conditions, p53 stimulates ESCs to secrete WNT ligands that inhibit differentiation, thereby maintaining a pluripotent state [107]. As p53 activates the expression of LIF interleukin-6 [108], the WNT signaling pathway and its synergistic interaction with LIF interleukin-6 play important role in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal of human and murine cells [109,110].",
        "MicroRNAs (miRs) repress the expression of mRNA targets by promoting translational repression and mRNA degradation. [111]. Their regulatory effects appear complex. miR-294 and miR-302 promote the abbreviated G1 phase of the ESC cell division cycle and suppress ESC differentiation [[112] and references therein]. Other miRNAs can prevent ESC self-renewal, and their activities are antagonized by miR-294 and miR-302. The differentiation-inducing effect of miRNAs was retinoblastoma protein (Rb) dependent, but their ability to inhibit ESC self-renewal was Rb-independent.",
        "In contrast to wild-type ESCs, elevated levels of p53 activity restricts differentiation of ESCs that are deficient in miRs [113]. p53 prevented these ESCs from differentiating in the neural direction. However, expression of miR-302 promoted ESC differentiation by direct interaction with p53. Similarly, inactivation of p53 by association with SV40 large T antigen, by suppressing p53 RNA translation with shRNA, or by genetic ablation of the p53 gene enabled differentiation. In contrast, activating p53 by treating miR-deficient ESCs with the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin inhibited neural differentiation. Thus, low levels of p53 allowed differentiation, whereas high levels of p53 inhibited differentiation. Moreover, cellular levels of p53 appear to be regulated by various miRs, presumably in response to environmental signals.",
        "A transactivation-deficient isoform of p53, Δ40p53 is highly expressed in ESCs, and is the major p53 isoform during early mouse embryonic development. p53 is maintained in an inactive state by the presence of Δ40p53. Haploinsufficiency for Δ40p53 causes a loss of pluripotency in ESCs and compromises their ability to grow, while its increased dosage prolongs pluripotency and inhibits differentiation. Δ40p53 controls p53 at targets such as Nanog and the IGF-1 receptor to switch from pluripotent to differentiated cells [114]. Δ40p53 overexpression reduces p53 activity by inhibiting its transactivation domain [115,116] and promoting nuclear export of p53–Δ40p53 heterotetramers [117]. In ESCs, overexpression of Δ40p53 interferes with the ability of p53 to regulate the transcription of p21, Nanog, and Igf-1R which are involved in the switch between pluripotency and differentiation [23,118,119]. Moreover, N-terminal truncated isoforms ΔNp73 of p73 decreases p53 leading to an increase in Nanog gene expression which subsequently enhanced human iPSC generation [120]. Although less explored in stem cell regulation, p63 and p73 functions in cooperation with p53 in the regulation of adult stem-like cells [121].",
        "p53 does not regulate expression of genes essential for ESC self-renewal. In fact, p53 activity must be maintained at a low level in ESCs to prevent differentiation (Section 7). Moreover, p53 activity is not a significant factor in maintaining the pluripotent state. Both wild-type and p53-/- ESCs undergo self-renewal in vitro as well as in vivo. They both proliferate, produce teratomas, contribute to chimeras, and produce living mice. In fact, p53-/- ESCs proliferate faster [84] and p53-/- 2-cell embryos development faster [49] than their wild-type counterparts. The primary distinction between wild-type and p53-/- mice is that p53-/- mice accumulate genomic abnormalities during development that eventually result in tumors and lethality.",
        "p53 is not essential for ESC differentiation, because embryos lacking p53 genes can still gastrulate and develop, and newborns can thrive until succumbing to tumors at 3 to 5 months of age [14]. Nevertheless, p53 facilitates differentiation of pluripotent stem cells [40,84,104], and p53 inhibits conversion of differentiated cells into pluripotent cells [122,123,124,125].",
        "The frequency at which reprogramming of differentiated cells into pluripotent cells by ectopic expression of genes, such as Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and others is suppressed by the high levels of p53 in differentiated cells and stimulated by reducing p53 expression, because p53 represses transcription of the reprogramming genes [23,24]. However, differentiation of ESCs is not induced simply by p53 inhibiting expression of the core pluripotency genes Oct4, Sox2, or Nanog, because these genes are down regulated during LIF-deprivation at equivalent rates in both p53+/+ and p53-/- ESCs [126]. Therefore, if p53 facilitates differentiation of ESCs, it must do so indirectly as well as directly.",
        "Doxorubicin/Adriamycin increases the number of differentiated colonies appearing in naïve p53+/+ ESCs, but not in p53-/- ESCs, due to p53-mediated transcriptional repression of ESC-specific transcription factors [24]. Doxorubicin also dramatically stimulated expression of genes characteristic of differentiated cells in p53+/+ embryoid bodies, but not in p53-/- embryoid bodies. ESC aggregation is the initial step in triggering ESC differentiation in the form of ‘embryoid bodies’ that consist of cells characteristic of cells derived from the three primary germ layers [127,128]. Thus, the ability of DNA damage to promote ESC differentiation is p53-dependent.",
        "In response to DNA damage, p53 protein is activated by phosphorylation at S315 and over expressed. Activated p53 binds to the Nanog promoter where it displaces OCT4 and SOX2, thereby suppressing NANOG expression and driving ESCs differentiation [23,129,130]. p53 also mediates direct repression of Nanog transcription by recruitment of MSIN3A to p53 bound at the Nanog promoter [23]. MSIN3A is a histone deacetylase that represses transcription [131]. Activation of p53 by treating cells with nutlin, a specific inhibitor of MDM2, also induces ESC differentiation [55]. Nutlin induced suppression of NANOG and OCT4 expression with concomitant induction of GATA4 and GATA6 expression, two transcription factors that are essential for embryonic development during gastrulation [132].",
        "Reprogramming differentiated cells into ‘induced pluripotent stem cells’ is achieved specifically by over expressing the core pluripotency transcription factors OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG, in combination with other transcription factors, such as KLF4, LIN28A/LIN28 and MYC [133]. p53 acts as barrier to reprogramming by inhibiting expression of these genes in differentiated cells. This is evident from the fact that reprogramming p53-/- somatic cells is much easier than reprogramming p53+/+ somatic cells [122,123,124,125]. Apart from this, MYC activates ARF-dependent and p53-dependent pathways that elevate the p53 barrier to reprogramming [134]. Activation of p53-dependent pathways in response to DNA damage also elevate expression of p53, which suppresses expression of NANOG [135].",
        "Haploid cells are a characteristic of early post-implantation embryos [136]. Deprivation of LIF interleukin-6 forces naive ESCs to either differentiate in the mesendodermal direction or undergo apoptosis [137,138]. Remarkably, LIF-deprivation of naïve ESCs drives formation of haploid-like cells in p53+/+ cells, but not in p53-/- cells [126]. Haploid ESCs are a useful tool for loss-of-function genetic screening [139].",
        "p53 promotes ESC differentiation, and once a differentiated state is produced, p53 activity stabilizes the differentiated state.",
        "ESCs exhibit three physiological states termed ‘ground state’, ‘naïve’, and ‘primed’ [140,141,142]. ESCs cultured in the presence of serum and LIF interleukin-6 are considered ‘naïve ’ pluripotent ESCs, because they give rise primarily to somatic tissues and germ cells but not to the trophectoderm. Most studies on ESCs fall into this category (Figure 2).",
        "‘Naïve ESCs’ cultured in defined medium (no serum) containing two kinase inhibitors, one against MAP2K1/MEK1 and one against FRAT2/GSK-3, are thought to model ‘ground-state’ pluripotent ESCs, because they can give rise to both extraembryonic (placental and yolk sac) and embryonic (epiblast and its derivatives) cells. ‘Ground-state ESCs’ are termed 2iESCs [143]. 2iESCs are pluripotent and perform well in chimera formation [144].",
        "‘Naïve ESCs’ can also differentiate into ‘primed ESCs’ when cultured in the presence of activin and fibroblast growth factor. Both ‘naïve ESCs’ and ‘primed ESCs’ can differentiate into mesoderm, endoderm, ectoderm, as well as germ cells. However, ‘naïve ESCs’ can readily generate chimeric animals, whereas ‘primed ESCs’ cannot. Therefore, primed ESCs are thought to model the epiblast in early embryos and are termed EpiSCs. In fact, transcriptomes in mouse EpiSCs derived from the pre-gastrula stage to late-bud-stage embryos are hierarchically distinct from those of ESCs and epiblast ectoderm but similar to the ectoderm of the late-gastrula embryo [145]. Thus, naïve ESCs are thought to model the pre- or peri-implantation embryonic epiblast, whereas EpiSCs model the early post-implantation epiblast [146,147].",
        "The absence of a G1-checkpoint together with the presence of a G2-checkpoint is a hallmark of both naïve ESCs and cancer cells [148]. The G2 checkpoint appears as a transient accumulation of cells containing 4N DNA in response to DNA damage prior to induction of apoptosis [149]. Double-strand DNA breaks induced by culturing cells with the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin/Adriamycin activates the G2 checkpoint in naïve ESCs regardless of the presence or absence of p53 [24,126,150,151], p21 or PUMA [[126], Figure 4C)].",
        "The G1 checkpoint is a more nuanced response to cell stress that retards entrance into S phase [152]. Naïve mouse ESCs lack a G1 DNA damage checkpoint [126,150,151,153,154,155], although it might exist in 2iESCs [156]. Naive ESCs are characterized by hyper-phosphorylated RB1 protein, lack of G1 control, and rapid progression through the cell cycle. In contrast, 2iESCs have a longer G1-phase with hypophosphorylated RB1, implying that they have a functional G1 checkpoint. The RB1-dependent G1 restriction point is active in ESCs propagated under 2i culture conditions but abrogated by ERK-dependent phosphorylation when cultured in serum [157].",
        "Given that p53 activation in mice does not induce cell death until gastrulation, and that p53 is not required to activate the G2 checkpoint, one would expect that pluripotent stem cells would not require p53 to induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage or other cell stresses. Remarkably, of the nine studies that have addressed this issue, three concluded that p53 is not required for DNA damage to induce cell death [126,151,153] and six concluded that p53 is required [150,155,158,159,160]. Six studies compared p53+/+ with p53-/- ESCs [126,151,153,155,158,159]. Two studies used shRNA to constitutively suppress p53 expression [150,160]. One study relied solely on changes in p53 expression in response to apoptotic stimuli [52].",
        "Since pluripotent stem cells are programmed to either proliferate, differentiate, or die, Jaiswal and coworkers [126] investigated multiple parameters that might affect naïve ESCs. They found that, regardless of their derivation, naïve ESCs do not require p53, p21 or PUMA either to activate the G2-checkpoint or to undergo programmed cell death rapidly and efficiently via a non-canonical apoptosis pathway. The effects of the concentration of the DNA damaging agent commonly used in these studies (doxorubicin/Adriamycin) and cell confluency were marginal, but the effects of cell differentiation were dramatic; p53-dependent regulation of cell division and apoptosis were acquired during p53-dependent differentiation of ESCs in vitro.",
        "To eliminate the possibility that these conclusions depended on either the source or derivation of ESCs, wild-type and p53-/- ESCs derived directly from blastocysts were characterized in parallel with ESCs in which the p53 genes were ablated in vitro. The effects of doxorubicin in these two ESC derivations were indistinguishable over a 40-fold range of concentrations, and cell culture conditions were compared over a 50-fold range of seeding densities. To eliminate methodology-dependent biases, apoptosis was quantified by time dependent increases in annexin-V binding to detect apoptosis, in propidium iodide staining to distinguish apoptosis from necrosis, and in trypan blue staining to distinguish live cells from dead cells, as well as time dependent loss of DNA to establish cell death. Analyses of p53, p21, PUMA, γ-H2AX, PARP, and CASP3 proteins were done to confirm genotypes, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Canonical apoptosis involves cleavage of CASP3, whereas non-canonical apoptosis does not. Non-canonical apoptosis was confirmed by translocation of AIFM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.",
        "The inhibitory effect of only 50 nM doxorubicin on naïve ESCs-regardless of the presence or absence of p53—is evident from visual inspection of cultured cells (Figure 4A,B). The lethal effect of doxorubicin is evident from the accumulation of cells with <2N DNA content (Figure 4C,D). Short exposure (24 h) of low concentration (50 nM) of doxorubicin to mouse ESCs, then allowing them to recover for 96 h proved that even minimal DNA damage is enough to induce apoptosis in mouse ESCs regardless presence of p53.",
        "Studies on the role of p53 in ground-state 2iESCs produced contradictory results that mirror those reported for naïve ESCs. Two studies in mouse 2iESCs revealed that DNA damage induced either by aphidicolin inhibition of DNA polymerase-α or doxorubicin inhibition of topoisomerase II activates genes characteristic of zygotic gene expression in mouse 2-cell to 4-cell embryos [161,162]. Both studies concluded that the mechanism driving this expression is mediated by an ATR and CHK1 response to double-strand DNA breaks. However, one study concluded that activation required p53 expression [162], whereas the other study concluded that it did not [161]. Critical experiments in which p53+/+ and p53-/- 2iESCs were compared were carried in both studies, but with opposite results. A third study concluded that doxorubicin induced p53-dependent apoptosis in 2iESCs [156].",
        "Contradictory results concerning the DNA damage response during early mammalian development can be reconciled on the following bases: (1) Suboptimal culture conditions for ESCs can result in spontaneous differentiation or cell death. (2) Treatment of cells with compounds at far greater concentrations that required to affect a specific target invariably affects unintended targets that can produce unexpected side effects. (3) Analysis of nullizygous cell lines is imperative for determining whether or not a gene is required for a particular function. (4) Time dependent comparisons of p53-/- with p53+/+ cell lines are imperative to determine whether or not a gene is required to complete a particular function. (5) Constitutive suppression of genes with shRNA selects for clones that remain viable, thus selecting for off-target mutations in addition to the targeted gene.",
        "Six of the studies described above compared ESCs derived from p53-/- blastocysts produced by mating p53+/- mice with p53+/+ ESCs from the same matings [61,126,151,153,155,159]. Remarkably, two studies using blastocyst derived-ESCs (BD-ESCs) from the same source (Rudolf Jaenisch, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA) reported contradictory results. One found that 1.84 µM Doxorubicin (ADR) rapidly induced apoptosis in >90% of p53+/+ and p53-/- cells [153], whereas the other reported that the same concentration of ADR induced apoptosis in 50% of p53+/+ cells but 0% of p53-/- cells [159].",
        "The simplest explanation is that culturing ESCs to “sub-confluence” before adding ADR [159] created conditions in which excessively high concentrations of drug induced apoptosis in p53+/+ cells more rapidly than in p53-/- cells, as shown in other studies [126,153]. For example, ESCs undergoing self-renewal should not be allowed to proliferate to >80% confluency, because clumps of p53+/+ ESCs tend to differentiate [163], and p53-dependent events are clearly associated with differentiated cells.",
        "Depending on seeding density and ADR concentration, ADR triggers p53-dependent apoptosis an average of 8.4 ± 0.5 h earlier than p53-independent apoptosis, but both p53+/+ and p53-/- naïve ESCs complete apoptosis within 72 h (Figure 4D). As little as 0.05 µM Doxorubicin is sufficient to induce apoptosis at the same time in both p53+/+ and p53-/- naïve ESCs which then proceeds to completion at equivalent rates. The fact that ectopic over-expression of certain p53 mutations also suppressed ADR-induced apoptosis [159] simply reflects the fact that p53 affects expression of hundreds of different genes, some of which affect apoptosis. Many naturally occurring p53 mutations have the opposite effect; they gain additional oncogenic functions that endow cells with growth and survival advantages [164]. In addition, culture conditions are critical to maintain the pluripotent ESC state [141] and to prevent DNA damage from rapidly accumulating in ESCs cultured under suboptimal conditions [165]. Suboptimal culture conditions might well contribute to conflicting results.",
        "Remarkably, a second contradiction emerged from two studies using same source of ESCs (Yang Xu, Univ. California, San Diego, CA, USA). Both studies concluded that p53 is not required for cell cycle arrest [126,155] and their results with p53+/+ ESCs are indistinguishable, regardless of cell seeding density or ADR concentration [126,155]. However, one study concluded that p53 is essential for ADR-induced apoptosis [155] whereas the other study concluded that efficient apoptosis induced either by ADR or other stress inducers is not p53-dependent [126]. Reconciliation is achieved by virtue of the fact that results with blastocyst derived ESCs (BD-ESCs) were virtually indistinguishable from results with p53-/- ESCs derived by ablating the p53 genes in ESCs homozygous for a conditional p53 gene knockout [126]. Moreover, Li and co-workers relied on CASP3 cleavage to confirm apoptosis, which they detected with a monoclonal antibody specific for the cleaved form. Thus, they did not recognize that the extent of CASP3 cleavage was insignificant. Moreover, the time delay for initiation of apoptosis exhibited by naïve ESCs cultured with high concentrations of ADR meant that cleaved CASP3 did not appear until after 24 h. CASP3-dependent apoptosis also rapidly declines in p53-/- ESCs cultured under stress, such as the extremely high seeding density (260,000 cells/cm2) used in [155]. This was not a problem using the seeding densities in [126].",
        "Remarkably, two reports from the same laboratory reported apparently conflicting results. One report on induced UV-dependent DNA-damage in p53-deficient ESCs indicated that apoptosis is p53-independent [151], whereas another report from the same laboratory concluded that apoptosis is p53-dependent [158]. This conundrum likely resulted from the fact that the p53-deficient cells in these studies exhibited a complex karyotype that might include additional genetic defects. Neither report provided evidence that the cells used were pluripotent stem cells.",
        "Another study did not compare p53+/+ cells with p53-/- cells [52]. Instead, their conclusion that p53 is required for apoptosis in naïve ESCs was based solely on changes in p53 expression in response to apoptotic stimuli. Such changes in p53 expression are equally consistent with a role for p53 in cell differentiation. ESCs under stress characteristically undergo either differentiation or apoptosis [55,104], and changes observed in gene expression and relocalization of p53 from cytoplasm to nucleus are characteristics of ESC differentiation as well as apoptosis.",
        "Two studies concluded that ADR or etoposide-induced apoptosis was p53-dependent in ESC clones where either human TP53 [160] or mouse Trp53 [150] was suppressed constitutively by shRNA. Reconciliation comes from three possibilities. First, neither study excluded the possibility that off-target effects also repressed expression of genes required for apoptosis. Second, selection of viable ESC lines in these studies would select clones resistance to apoptosis, because constitutive suppression of p53-expression by shRNA in mouse ESCs and embryos promotes clonal heterogeneity by disrupting DNA methylation homeostasis [40]. Third, since ESCs under stress characteristically undergo either differentiation or apoptosis [55,104], changes observed in gene expression and relocalization of p53 from cytoplasm to nucleus are characteristics ESC differentiation as well as apoptosis.",
        "Three studies have reported the effects of doxorubicin on mouse p53+/+ and p53-/- 2iESCs. One study cultured 2iESCs with 1 µM doxorubicin for 6 h and concluded that the DNA damage response was p53-dependent [162]. Another study carried out the same experiment using 1 µg/mL (1.84 µM) doxorubicin for 48 h and concluded that the DNA damage response was p53-independent [161]. Still a third study cultured 2iESCs with 1 μM doxorubicin for 16 h and observed that p53+/+ cells underwent apoptosis more quickly than p53-/- cells (63% p53+/+ cells versus 13% p53-/- cells) [156]. These results could easily be reconciled if the experiments did not use excessively high concentrations of doxorubicin and if they monitored the effects of doxorubicin over time.",
        "Similar conditions with naïve ESCs revealed that apoptosis begins more quickly in p53+/+ cells than in p53-/- cells, particularly with excessively high concentrations of doxorubicin, but the rates at which cells undergo apoptosis are equivalent, and the extent of apoptosis within 48 to 72 h is equivalent [126,153]. As little as 0.05 µM doxorubicin is sufficient to induce apoptosis in naïve ESCs (Figure 4). Depending on seeding density and doxorubicin concentration, p53+/+ ESCs initiate apoptosis 8.4 ± 0.5 h earlier than p53-/- ESCs, but both p53+/+ and p53-/- ESCs complete apoptosis within 72 h (Figure 4D). To determine whether or not p53 is essential for a DNA damage response in ground-state 2iESCs requires that the response of 2iESCs to different extents of DNA damage is characterized over time.",
        "A separate concern is that 2iESC culture conditions enforce self-renewal and a dramatic loss of spontaneously differentiating cells (Navarro, 2018). So far, only naïve ESCs can proliferate and transit easily to the ‘ground-state’ under these conditions, whereas neither EpiSCs nor differentiated somatic cells survive these conditions. In addition, the application of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to isolate ESC clones with specific gene alterations raises the possibility that additional ‘off-target’ mutations might be included that affect gene expression, cell proliferation, or cell death.",
        "Cell cycle arrest in naïve ESCs is p53-independent. Similarly, both the rate and the extent of apoptosis in naïve ESCs is p53-independent. However–depending on experimental conditions–p53 can accelerate initiation of apoptosis by a few hours. Recognizing this distinction requires both time dependent assays and DNA damaging agent concentration dependent assays. Results with naïve ESCs appear to be true for 2iESCs as well, and is likely to be true for primed EpiSCs, although this hypothesis has not yet been tested. However, these conclusions are consistent with the fact that inactivation of any one of the three proteins essential for post-translational regulation of p53 activity (Section 1), does not arrest embryonic development until gastrulation or later (Section 4.2). Therefore, the level of p53 activity in vivo is not sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis until gastrulation.",
        "Depriving naïve ESCs of LIF interleukin-6 forces them to either differentiate in the mesendodermal direction or undergo apoptosis [137,138]. Under these conditions, LIF-deprivation of p53+/+ ESCs increased genomic stability, suppressed the DNA damage induced G2-checkpoint, and increased the rate and extent of DNA damage-induced apoptosis [126]. The G2-checkpoint in ESCs was p53-independent, but after ESC differentiation in vitro, the G2-checkpoint was evident only in p53-/- cells; differentiation of p53+/+ ESCs resulted in loss of the G2-checkpoint. Moreover, apoptosis in either p53+/+ or p53-/- ESCs included cleavage of caspase-3, whereas apoptosis in differentiated ESCs did not. Thus, LIF-deprivation of naïve ESCs in vitro transformed pluripotent cells into differentiated cells with characteristics similar to oncogenic MEFs.",
        "Early passage p53-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from E12 to E14 divide faster than wild-type MEFs, achieve higher cell densities, and have a higher fraction of division-competent cells at low cell density. The fraction of p53-/- MEFs with 2N DNA content (G1 phase) is less than in wild-type MEFS, consistent with a p53-dependent G1 checkpoint. p53+/+ MEFs senesce in response to excessive DNA damage, whereas p53-/- MEFs develop aneuploidy and chromosomal abnormalities Thus, loss of p53 in MEFs confers a proliferation advantage, but not immortality [86].",
        "In contrast with embryos undergoing gastrulation, deletion of Mdm2 has no effect on viability of MEFs [68,69]. Moreover, p53-/- MEFs and p53-/-; Mdm2-/- MEFs were indistinguishable in their proliferation, response to genotoxic agents, genetic instability, and ability to form spontaneous tumors. Thus, in the absence of p53, deletion of Mdm2 has no additional effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle control, or tumorigenesis in differentiated embryonic cells.",
        "p53 induces cellular senescence when cell cycle arrest is not enough to repair DNA damage. In cells with oncogenic activation, telomere shortening, or oxidative stress, cellular senescence prevents proliferation permanently, while retaining the cell’s function [30,166]. However, release from non-senescence temporary cell cycle arrest can lead to proliferation of cells with oncogenic potential and development of tumors [21].",
        "Only p53+/+ MEFs upregulate expression of p53, p21, and PUMA in response to double-strand DNA breaks introduced by doxorubicin [126]. Nevertheless, MEFs respond to low levels of either natural or induced DNA damage by undergoing p53-dependent senescence rather than apoptosis [68,86,126,167], whereas p53-/- MEFs undergo apoptosis [126,168,169]. Cell senescence is preceded by p53-dependent complete cell cycle arrest wherein cells do not accumulate in a specific cell cycle phase, but simply stop proliferating in place [170]. In the absence of p53, MEFs respond to DNA damage with a transient G2 checkpoint followed by caspase-3 independent apoptosis [126,168,169].",
        "At high doxorubicin concentrations, MEFs exhibit p53-independent apoptosis [126,171]. Similarly, in the absence of MDM2, artificially high levels of p53 induce apoptosis [172]. Thus, the choice between senescence and apoptosis appears to depend on the cellular level of activated p53 protein.",
        "MEFs exhibit p53-dependent apoptosis or premature senescence when they are immortalized with an oncogene such as adenovirus E1a [173,174,175,176], Myc [177] or oncogenic Ras [169]. In contrast, normal p53+/+ MEFs undergo complete cell cycle arrest in response to double-strand DNA breaks [126,178,179,180], whereas p53-/- MEFs continue to proliferate until they undergo apoptosis [126,171].",
        "Only when embryonic development has produced differentiated fibroblasts, has p53 activity been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate and extent at which DNA damage induces cell cycle arrest to allow repair of DNA damage, and cell senescence to prevent proliferation of cells with DNA damage. Whether or not DNA damage can also induce apoptosis in embryonic cells remains to be determined.",
        "Analysis of the of effects of p53 on mammalian development reveals several surprising conclusions. Although p53 mRNA has been detected from zygote to adult (Section 1 and Section 2.1), p53 protein has not. In fact, evidence for p53-dependent transcription first appears during mouse development in the inner cell mass of late blastocysts, and the p53-specific regulatory protein MDM2 first becomes essential for mouse development when gastrulation begins by preventing p53 activity from arresting embryonic development (Section 4.1 and Section 4.2). Thus, p53 activity appears to begin with formation of pluripotent stem cells and thereafter accumulates as cells undergo differentiation, suggesting that totipotent blastomeres undergo cell cleavage in the absence of p53 activity.",
        "p53-mediated cell cycle arrest allows non-malignant as well as malignant cells to repair damaged DNA. When DNA repair is complete, cells can reenter the normal cell cycle. In contrast, when cells have serious DNA damage, p53 exerts its pro-apoptotic function to eliminate these cells, thereby preventing transfer of damaged DNA to daughter cells [181,182,183]. This function of p53 is first detected with embryonic fibroblasts where p53 significantly increases the rate and extent at which DNA damage induces cell cycle arrest to allow repair of DNA damage, and cell senescence to prevent proliferation of cells with DNA damage while maintaining their metabolic contribution. Ablation of Mdm2, Mdm4 or Rbbp6 at the beginning of mouse development results in post-implantation lethality, but whether the failure of embryos to continue development results from high levels of p53 activity inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or cell senescence is not clear. What is clear, is that p53 activity must be regulated during gastrulation and subsequent embryonic development. Nevertheless, several conclusions as to the role of p53 at the beginning of mammalian development are justified.",
        "The ability of ESCs to undergo self-renewal is unaffected by the presence or absence of p53, revealing that p53 does not play a significant role in maintaining expression of genes required for pluripotency (Section 6). However, the ability of ESCs to maintain genomic stability during self-renewal is p53-dependent (Section 5), thus p53’s role as ‘guardian of genome’ begins with formation of pluripotent stem cells. In addition, p53 facilitates differentiation of pluripotent stem cells and inhibits reprogramming of differentiated cells into pluripotent cells (Section 7). Therefore, although p53 is not essential for cell differentiation during gastrulation, it does facilitate this event.",
        "The DNA damage response in embryonic cells appears more complex, but justifiable conclusions are possible by analysis of critical differences in experimental conditions (Section 8.5.1). In the case of naïve ESCs, a G1 phase cell cycle arrest is absent and a transient G2 phase cell cycle arrest is p53-independent. Moreover, DNA damage induced apoptosis occurs at the same rate and to the same extent in p53-/- ESCs as in p53+/+ ESCs. However, depending on experimental conditions, initiation of apoptosis is accelerated by several hours in p53+/+ ESCs (Section 8.5.2). When differences in experimental conditions are taken into account, the same conclusions could apply to 2iESCs, as well (Section 8.4 and Section 8.5.3). Results with EpiSCs have yet to be reported.",
        "Given that fact that p53 is neither essential for ESC renewal nor differentiation, which is evident from the facts that embryos lacking p53 genes continue to gastrulate and develop, and that newborns thrive until succumbing to tumors, then how is the genome protected prior to gastrulation? The answer is that p53 is neither required for cell cycle arrest nor apoptosis in either naïve or ground-state ESCs. Therefore, regardless of the cellular stress and regardless of the genomic defect, totipotent and pluripotent stem cells can undergo apoptosis prior to implantation. Thus, p53-independent apoptosis provides a mechanism for promoting implantation of healthy embryos.",
        "The biological significance of what is learned through characterization of ESCs in vitro depends entirely on their ability to model events demonstrated in vivo. The lessons learned from studies on the DNA damage response in both 2iESCs and naïve ESCs demonstrate the challenges involved.",

        "Preimplantation and early post-implantation mouse development. The p53 transcription factor and tumor suppressor protein is not essential for mammalian embryonic development, although it does facilitate several important events beginning with maintaining genomic stability by preventing polyploidy and aneuploidy during self-renewal of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Self-renewal refers to the ability of pluripotent stem cells to undergo an indefinite number of cell divisions without losing their ability to differentiate into cells derived from all three primary germ layers. In ESCs, p53 facilitates differentiation during gastrulation, although it is not required for either transient cell cycle arrest or induction of apoptosis in response to DNA damage. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), DNA damage induces either p53-facilitated transient cell cycle arrest or cell senescence.

      "abstract": "In the field of cell-based therapeutics, there is a great need for high-quality, robust, and validated measurements for cell characterization. Flow cytometry has emerged as a critically important platform due to its high-throughput capability and its ability to simultaneously measure multiple parameters in the same sample. However, to assure the confidence in measurement, well characterized biological reference materials are needed for standardizing clinical assays and harmonizing flow cytometric results between laboratories. To date, the lack of adequate reference materials, and the complexity of the cytometer instrumentation have resulted in few standards. This study was designed to evaluate CD19 expression in three potential biological cell reference materials and provide a preliminary assessment of their suitability to support future development of CD19 reference standards. Three commercially available human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from three different manufacturers were tested. Variables that could potentially contribute to the differences in the CD19 expression, such as PBMCs manufacturing process, number of healthy donors used in manufacturing each PBMC lot, antibody reagent, operators, and experimental days were included in our evaluation. CD19 antibodies bound per cell (ABC) values were measured using two flow cytometry-based quantification schemes with two independent calibration methods, a single point calibration using a CD4 reference cell and QuantiBrite PE bead calibration. Three lots of PBMC from three different manufacturers were obtained. Each lot of PBMC was tested on three different experimental days by three operators using three different lots of unimolar anti-CD19PE conjugates. CD19 ABC values were obtained in parallel on a selected lot of the PBMC samples using mass spectrometry (CyTOF) with two independent calibration methods, EQ4 and bead-based calibration were evaluated with CyTOF-technology. Including all studied variabilities such as PBMC lot, antibody reagent lot, and operator, the averaged mean values of CD19 ABC for the three PBMC manufacturers (A,B, and C) obtained by flow cytometry were found to be: 7953 with a %CV of 9.0 for PBMC-A, 10535 with a %CV of 7.8 for PBMC-B, and 12384 with a %CV of 16 for PBMC-C. These CD19 ABC values agree closely with the findings using CyTOF. The averaged mean values of CD19 ABC for the tested PBMCs is 9295 using flow cytometry-based method and 9699 using CyTOF. The relative contributions from various sources of uncertainty in CD19 ABC values were quantified for the flow cytometry-based measurement scheme. This uncertainty analysis suggests that the number of antigens or ligand binding sites per cell in each PBMC preparation is the largest source of variability. On the other hand, the calibration method does not add significant uncertainty to the expression estimates. Our preliminary assessment showed the suitability of the tested materials to serve as PBMC-based CD19+ reference control materials for use in quantifying relevant B cell markers in B cell lymphoproliferative disorders and immunotherapy. However, users should consider the variabilities resulting from different lots of PBMC and antibody reagent when utilizing cell-based reference materials for quantification purposes and perform bridging studies to ensure harmonization between the results before switching to a new lot.",

        "Cell-based therapies have emerged as potential novel approaches to treat many diseases and regenerate damaged tissues [1–3]. At present, immunotherapy has been widely explored and shows promising results in treating cancer patients [4–7]. One immunotherapy approach uses an engineered version of each patients T cells modified to attack cancer cells, these modified cells are known as Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cells. Several clinical trials have demonstrated activity of CAR-T cells against multiple subtypes of B-cell lymphoma [8–11], including follicular Lymphoma [12,13], diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [12,14], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [7], and refractory acute B- cell lymphoblastic leukemia [15–18]. Within this greater context, flow cytometry plays an increasingly important role in disease diagnosis, and monitor patients after treatment for assessing the efficacy of the given therapy [19–24]; and providing guidance for selecting the appropriate targeted therapies in B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia [17,18]. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of flow cytometry in identifying patients who will benefit the most from the immunotherapeutic products [25,26]. This is mainly due to the ability of flow cytometry to quantify the expression level of important markers on malignant cells. Currently, multiple new emerging treatment options for B- cell malignancies rely on evaluating CD19 expression either to initiate the process [11,14,27] or select patients who will benefit from targeted monoclonal antibody therapies [28,29]. Pillai et al., have published data demonstrating that anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is effective for CD19-dim B-lymphoblastic leukemia compared with CD19-normal or -bright expression [25]. Ramakrishna and co-workers have reported that low CD22 expression negatively impacts in vitro and in vivo anti-CD22 CART functionality and impairs in vivo CART persistence [26]. There is an urgent need to develop a robust method to better quantify the expression level of crucial markers that are directly involved in crucial processes such as patient selection and critical treatment decisions in B cell malignancy [25,26,30–32]. It is equally important to characterize response of B-cell malignancies to personalized T cell immunotherapy products to ensure their safety and efficacy [16,20,21]. However, the lack of adequate biological and non-biological reference materials, as well as the complexity of the cytometer instrumentation, have resulted in few standards to improve confidence in such measurements.",
        "The ultimate goal of comparable and quantitative flow cytometry is to determine the number of antigens or ligand binding sites associated with a cell by measuring the number of antibodies bound per cell (ABC) [23,31,33,34]. A robust flow cytometric method should therefore include proper controls and standards, i.e. particles and biological reference materials for instrument calibration, performance characterization, and standardization [35,36]. A common calibration approach uses QuantiBrite PE beads with unimolar monoclonal antibody PE conjugates to enable measurement of antigen expressions in terms of ABC value [37,38]. However, as this scheme relies on PE calibration beads, it is limited to calibrating only those channels associated with the PE fluorescence. This motivates us to consider a second calibration approach that uses a biological reference cell material known to possess a fixed number of well characterized CD4 protein biomarkers [32,39–42]. Several studies showed variations in CD4 expression on normal T cells between healthy subjects [37,43] which highlight the need of a robust reference material with consistent and stable antigen expression for the purposes of quantitative flow cytometry.",
        "Our multi-year efforts on quantifying CD4 expression levels on human T lymphocytes aimed at identifying reliable reference biomarkers. We demonstrated consistent CD4 expression on Cyto-Trol Control Cells by three independent methods: flow cytometry, mass cytometry (CyTOF), and quantitative mass spectrometry [38,42]. Hence, the lyophilized Cyto-Trol Control Cells with the three method-averaged CD4 ABC value of 40,500 make this alternative quantification approach accessible to all channels of flow cytometers [38,42].",
        "To address the urgent need for population specific reference materials that can be used as a reference upon which other relevant markers could be quantified, this study was designed to characterize CD19 expression levels on three commercially available, lyophilized or dried-down peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). As these PBMC preparations are both widely accessible to users and expected to exhibit less variability than fresh and cryopreserved PBMCs from healthy individuals, they are candidates for the development of CD19 reference controls. Our study aims to support their future development into reference standards.",
        "The key outputs of this work are to quantify CD19 expression, and thoroughly explore the associated variations in each PBMC preparation and assess the impact of uncertainties arising from all aspects including cell manufacturing, the instrumentation, antibody reagent, and sample preparation. Because our work focuses on characterization of PBMC preparations in support of reference material development and standardization, uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a fundamental role in our analysis. In more formal metrology settings, this process involves an in-depth analysis of the measurement tools used to characterize the standards, material manufacturing processes, and/or considerations associated with SI traceability. However, cell-based references, e.g. for cytometry, are challenging to develop because inherent biological variability and complex cell-optical-instrument interactions make it difficult to accurately perform uncertainty analyses. A secondary objective of this study is therefore to develop mathematical tools that support more general standardization of cell-based reference materials for cytometry measurements.",
        "PBMC preparations including the respective reconstitution buffers were purchased from three different manufacturers. (PBMC-A was obtained from Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, CA) as described in Wang et al., 2012 [38] Additionally, two PBMC preparations were purchased from two different manufacturers: BD Biosciences (San Jose, California) and Bio Legend (San Diego, California). Each manufacturer used their own lyophilization protocol either to freeze or to dry down peripheral blood mononuclear cells. PBMC -B was produced from a single healthy blood donor. Whereas, PBMC-A and PBMC-C were manufactured from pooled donor samples (a minimum of three normal donors). Three different lots of each PBMC preparation made by each manufacturer were used in this study.

Antibody concentration was selected to ensure staining saturation (meaning small changes in antibody concentration have little effect on median fluorescence intensity (MedFI) of stained cells) and used thought out the entire study.",
        "The flow cytometric measurements were performed using FACSCanto 10 equipped with FACS Diva software for data acquisition and analysis (BD Biosciences). Cytometer setup and tracking beads (CST, BD Biosciences) were used for daily quality control and setup of initial PMT voltages. On the first day of experiment, PMT voltage of the PE channel was optimized to ensure the MedFI of unstained cells is approximately 2.5 times above the electron noise of the PE channel according to previously published protocol [45]. QuantiBrite PE beads were then run; the resulting MedFI values of the four PE intensity beads were recorded and used as target values to ensure consistency between experiments performed at different days. If needed, the PMT voltage of PE channel was slightly adjusted to ensure that the target MedFI values were achieved for instrument performance harmonization.",
        "To measure CD19 and CD4 expression levels, the first gate, P1, was set on singlets using a dot plot of FSC-A vs. FSC-H, and a lymphocyte gate, P2, was then defined by FSC-A versus SSC-A under the P1 gate shown in Fig 1. While gated on lymphocytes (P2), CD19 and CD4 positive cells were identified using single color histograms. CD19 histograms are shown on the right of Fig 1 as examples. The expression levels of CD4 and CD19 in terms of MedFI were collected using the proposed gating strategy (n = 18 MedFI values /per lot of PBMC (n = 3) with 2 replicates, 3 lots of antibody reagent, and 3 experimental days).",

        "CD19 ABC values were calculated using two quantification approaches. The cell-based scheme uses CD4 expression on Cyto-Trol cells (PBMC-A) as a reference biomarker with a known ABC value of 40,500, an average value from three different measurement methods previously published [38,42,45]. The CD19 ABC values were calculated using the following equation:\nABCCD19=(MedFICD19/MedFICD4)×ABCCD4(1)",
        "The second, bead-based quantification scheme utilizes QuantiBrite PE beads with a known number of PE molecules per bead for four bead populations [43]. Using a linear regression of Log10 MedFI of each bead population verse Log10 PE molecules per bead (y = mx + c), the MedFI value measured in the PE channel was converted to the number of PE molecules bound per cell. Because of the use of CD19 PE 1:1 for cell staining, the number of PE molecules bound per cell is equal to the number of antibodies bound per cell i.e. the CD19 ABC value.",
        "A pilot study was conducted on a selected subset of the PBMC samples to quantify in parallel CD19 expression using CyTOF with two independent calibration methods (EQ4 and ABC bead calibration). All samples were stained and analyzed according to the following protocol. Once three different PBMC samples were reconstituted, multiple vials of the same PBMC sample were combined into one tube; cell counting was performed followed by centrifuge with 300 xg for 5 minutes and supernatant aspiration. The pelleted cells were resuspended in the respective buffer to ensure that a 100 μL cell suspension contains 3 million cells. To this bulk suspension of cells, the master mix of antibodies from the Maxpar Human Peripheral Blood Basic I Kit excluding anti-CD19 antibody was added to a volume required for a specific number of cells being stained by the Kit. The bulk cell suspension was subsequently aliquoted into individual Eppendorf tubes as 100 μL (3 million cells) per tube. CD19 antibody was then added to each respective sample tube, and the tubes were incubated at RT for 30 minutes. CD19 antibody titration was performed ensuring CD19 quantification was carried out under saturated staining condition. Following incubation, tubes were spun down (300 xg for 5 min) and the supernatant was aspirated. Samples were washed with 1 mL CSB and spun (300 xg for 5 min), and the supernatant was aspirated. Cell samples were then fixed and intercalated overnight at 4°C by diluting the Ir-intercalator (final conc. 0.125 μM) in 1.6% formaldehyde in PBS solution (1 mL per sample). The next day, samples were spun down (800 xg for 5 min), supernatant was aspirated, and the cells were washed 2 times with CSB (2 mL, spun at 800 xg for 5 min, supernatant aspirated). The cells were counted and finally washed with PBS (same conditions as CSB wash). For sample acquisition, cell pellets were suspended in a solution of either ABC five element calibration beads or EQ four element calibration beads (diluted by 5 times) in CAS to a concentration of 0.5–1 x 106 cells/mL, with 100,000 events collected. Sample collection was performed on Helios, a CyTOF system. Two CyTOF quantification approaches (EQ four calibration, and ABC bead calibration) were used to determine CD19 ABC values. Three lots of PBMC (one per company) were analyzed to determine CD19 ABC value by this method.",
        "To better understand the various sources of uncertainty, estimate their relative contributions, and characterize typical variability of CD19 in healthy individuals, we analyzed a physically informed model of a cytometry measurement. Specifically, we postulated that for a fixed set of calibration parameters, the corresponding measurement values could be expressed as\nvi,j,k,l=miAj21+Aj2+bk+Nl(0,ϵ2)(2)\nwhere mi is the typical number of CD19 markers in the ith cell lot, Aj2/(1+Aj2) is the fraction of bound markers associated with the jth antibody lot, bk is a bias associated with the kth operator, and Nl(0, ϵ2) is the ith realization of a normal random variable with mean zero and variance ϵ2. The quantities mi, Aj, bk, and ϵ2 were determined by a maximum likelihood analysis of the data separately for fixed manufacturer and calibration procedures. Given that we considered all combinations of 3 cell lots, 3 antibody lots, and 3 operators, a total of 27 measurements were available to estimate these quantities for the 6 combinations of two calibration schemes and three manufacturers.",
        "Having determined these quantities, we next computed the sample means and sample variances\nμ≈∑imi/3,β=∑kbk/3,σm2≈0.5∑i(mi−μ)2,σb2≈0.5∑k(bk−β)2(3)\nand constructed synthetic noise models of the form\nm=μ+N(0,σm2),A=U[minj(Aj),maxj(Aj)],b=β+N(0,σb2)(4)\nwhere U[w, w′] is a uniform random variable on the domain [w, w′], and N(0, σ2) is a normal random variable with zero mean and variance σ2. Using random number generators, we created many independent realizations of these quantities, which we inserted into Eq 2 to create a synthetic distribution measurements accounting for the aforementioned uncertainties. To further account for uncertainty in the calibration (which determines the vi,j,k,l used in the maximum likelihood), we generated synthetic distributions of the corresponding calibration parameters and repeated the above process multiple times, combining all synthetic datasets to yield a final histogram of CD19 measurements.",
        "A key benefit of this analysis is its ability to explicitly characterize the uncertainty due to each of the aforementioned sources, including the calibration parameters. While details are reserved for the supplemental information, we note that the quantities\nRm=〈F¯2σm2〉ϕς2,RF=〈μ2σF2〉ϕς2,Rb=〈σb2〉ϕς2,Rϵ=〈ϵ〉ϕς2,Rmixed=〈σm2σF2〉ϕς2(5)\ncharacterize the relative uncertainties due to variation in the number of markers, fraction bound, bias, random errors, and mixed effects of multiple sources of uncertainty acting in concert. In these expressions, the notation 〈⋅〉ϕ refers to averages with respect to the calibration parameters (which we estimate via the random sampling approach described above), F- and σF2 refer to the mean and variance of F(A) = A2/(1+A2), and ς2 is the variance of a measurement accounting for all sources of uncertainty. It is also possible to show that Rc = 1 − Rm − Rf − Rb − Rϵ − Rmixed ≥ 0 is the relative fraction of uncertainty due to calibration.",
        "One of the critical steps in quantitative flow cytometry measurements is to ensure that comparable and reproducible results were obtained between experimental days. To achieve this objective, a single lot of QuantiBrite PE beads was used to ensure nearly identical performance characteristic of PE channel. The MedFI values of the four PE intensity beads were utilized as target values between different days’ experiments. Our results showed that comparable MedFI values were obtained in the three experimental days with coefficient of variations (CV) < 1.0% for all intensity peaks (Low, Med-Low, Med-High and High peaks) (S1 Table). The data suggest that this harmonization approach is efficient for reducing day-to-day instrument variations and ensuring that time factor has a negligible effect on the MedFI values obtained for PBMC samples.",
        "The cell-based quantitative schemes utilize CD4 on T-helper cells of Cyto-Trol with a known ABC value as a reference marker for the conversion of the measured MedFI values to ABC values [38,39]. This method relies on the consistency of CD4 expression on Cyto-Trol cells. As an assurance step and prior to using CD4 expression in PBMC-A as a reference marker for CD19 ABC value determination, we tested the consistency of CD4 expression on three different lots of Cyto-Trol cells (PBMC-A) stained with three different lots of CD4 PE 1:1 over three experimental days operated by three individuals. Eighteen CD4 MedFI values were collected per lot of PBMC (2 replicates, 3 lots of antibody reagent over 3 days). The CD4 MedFI values over two sample replicates were averaged to give a total of 27 CD4 MedFI values. These values were summarized in Table 1A.",
        "CD4 MedFI values obtained using three lots of PBMC-A and three lots of antibody reagent (CD4 PE 1:1) in 3 experimental days with three different operators were provided in Table 1A. Maximal %CV was calculated and shown in Table 1B for assessing uncertainty contribution from individual variable and combined variables.",
        "Including all variables (reagent lots, days and operators, and PBMC lots), the MedFI values of CD4 range from 46167 to 56294 (Table 1A) with overall averaged MedFI of 50370, standard deviation (SD) of 3070, and an overall % CV of 6.1. Fixing different combinations of control variables and examining the respective CV’s yields a qualitative breakdown of the total measurement variability. All CVs computed for a fixed antibody reagent lot are on the order of 2.1% or less, but they climb to between 6.1% and 7.4% when the variable of the antibody lot is included (Table 1B). P values much less than 0.05 were obtained between different lots of the antibody reagents, suggesting that this variable has a significant impact on the measured fluorescence values. On the other hand, P values of no less than 0.49 were attained between different lots of PBMC and different experimental days/operators, indicating that the differences in observed CD4 MedFI values due to these two variables are insignificant (S2 Table).",
        "While these results suggest that the CD4 expression levels are stable on the Cyto-Trol cells, the added variation due to antibody reagent lot motivated us to directly characterize the effect of using the CD4 reference material, Cyto-Trol cells on the CD19 measurements. In particular, we used the mathematical model analysis described above to isolate the relative contribution of each source of measurement variability in the raw CD4 data. Using Eqs (2)–(4), we then generated synthetic estimates of MedFICD4 appearing in Eq (1). These synthetic estimates were then used to determine CD19 values, with Rc [see Eq (5)] yielding the relative variation due to CD4 reference marker calibration. The additional uncertainty (relative to bead-based calibration) is on the order of 5.0% or less, consistent with the CV values reported above. Moreover, the estimated variability in CD19 measurements due to other sources is independent of the calibration method to a very good approximation. These observations suggest that the CD4 reference materials provide a reasonable and independent calibration strategy within the uncertainty thresholds so described.",

A combined uncertainty confidence interval is constructed by taking the union of confidence intervals for both cytometric calibration methods. The corresponding mean of combined uncertainty analysis is simply the average of the means determined by the two flow cytometry calibration methods.

        "Fig 4 shows the expected relative variations in CD19 measurement results shown in Fig 3 as a function PBMC manufacturer and calibration method. Specifically, this quantity is given by Δ=ς2/v-2, where ς2 was defined previously as the total uncertainty and v- is the expected value of a cytometry measurement. Of note, the cell marker number is by far the largest source of variability in the measurement, accounting for between 50% and 70%. As discussed previously, it is also reassuring that the calibration method does not significantly affect the estimates for the other sources of variation, suggesting that the likelihood analysis is able to isolate their individual contributions. We also note that the use of CD4 markers for calibration leads to a small but non-trivial increase in Δ. As an aside, the relative contribution from random effects is relatively large for the PBMC-A cells. Because of the limited nature of the model, this may reflect unresolved physical phenomena (e.g. associated with antibody binding), which thereby become combined with stochastic sources of uncertainty. However, without additional information or modeling, we cannot assign a specific cause to this variability.",

We characterized CD19 expression and associated uncertainty in three commercial lyophilized or dried-down PBMC preparations for assessing their suitability for future use as cell reference materials for cytometric expression analysis.",
        "Two quantification schemes of flow cytometry were applied to evaluate the consistency of CD19 expression over multiple variables in the tested cell preparations. One of the cytometric approaches employs Cyto-Trol Control Cells, a CD4 reference material with a preassigned ABC value [38,42] for translating the generated MedFI scale to the ABC scale. This CD4 ABC value was previously determined to be 40,500 using three independent methods, flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and quantitative mass spectrometry that used 4 different isotope labeled peptides as internal quantification standards [38,42]. First, we examined the consistency of CD4 expression levels in three Cyto-Trol (PBMC-A) lots using three batches of CD4 PE 1:1 antibody reagent in three different experimental days performed by three different operators (Table 1). The results show comparable MedFI values of CD4 with < 2.0% CV between different experimental days and operators for each PBMC and antibody reagent batches. Furthermore, when all four variables are included, we observed ≤ 7.0% CV in CD4 MedFI values (Table 1B). In 2018 Olga Mizrah and co-workers reported that even when using the same equipment in the same laboratory, the percentage of CV can vary between 7.0% and 33% depending on the tested marker [46]. The two-tailed, unequal variance T test identified a significant contribution from different lots of CD4 PE 1:1 conjugate to the overall variability of measured CD4 MedFI values (S2 Table). The small but non-trivial uncertainty contribution quantified by the computational analysis (Fig 4) mostly results from the manufacturing variability of this antibody reagent, which had been observed previously [37].",
        "The second flow cytometry quantification method is based on using QuantiBrite PE bead calibration and CD19 PE 1:1 conjugate. QuantiBrite PE bead calibration enables the transformation of MedFI values of CD19 to the number of PE molecules per cell. Because of the use of CD19 PE 1:1 for cell staining, the number of PE molecules bound per cell is a close approximation of the number of antibodies bound per cell, CD19 ABC value. Since the debut of QuantiBrite PE beads in the mid 1990 [43], it is regarded as the most reliable biomarker quantification method in flow cytometry. It is important to note that this bead-based quantification scheme is only limited to PE fluorescence channel. In addition, this method relies strongly on the quality of QuantiBrite PE beads and custom-made unimolar CD19 PE conjugates. Variations in CD19 MedFI values are clearly seen between three batches of CD19 PE 1:1 conjugate for all three PBMC preparations (Fig 2 and S3–S5 Tables). Similar to the CD4 PE 1:1 quality issue discussed above, the same issue was observed and reported for other unimolar antibody reagents e.g. CD38 PE 1:1 and CD22 PE 1:1 [33,34].",
        "In addition, CD19 ABC values were measured on selected three lots of PBMC (one per company) using two CyTOF quantification approaches (ABC bead calibration and EQ4 calibration). These quantification methods are based on the mean CyTOF intensities of the antibody stain on the cell and of the metal-encoded calibration bead(s), the independently characterized number of metal atoms per antibody molecule [47,48], and the independently characterized number of metal atoms per calibration bead [44]. The CyTOF intensity and the metal content of the bead are used to calculate the transmission coefficient for all major isotopes in the bead [49]. One method involves the use of the commercially available EQ4 beads that contain Ce, Eu, Ho, and Lu. In contrast, the second method uses a series of ABC beads with a roughly equivalent content of Ce, and with zero (ABC bead #1) and then logarithmically increased amount of La, Eu, Ho, and Lu (ABC beads #2–5). The EQ4 beads are used for a single-point calibration whereas the ABC beads allow a multi-point calibration. Test samples were run with both EQ4 and the ABC beads included. CyTOF data were not software-normalized, but instead an MS Excel sheet was used to calculate the number of antibody molecules bound per cell. Comparable CD19 ABC values were obtained between the flow cytometry and CyTOF quantification methods using a single lot of PBMC preparation. An overall averaged CD19 ABC of 9689 was obtained for all PBMCs together from the two CyTOF quantification-methods with an average of 9028 for PBMC-A, 9828 for PBMC-B, and 10211 for PBMC-C. This averaged CD19 ABC is comparable to an overall averaged CD19 ABC of 9295 for all PBMCs using the two-flow cytometry quantification-methods with an average CD19 ABC of 8014 for PBMC-A, 10399 for PBMC-B, and 9473 for PBMC-C). Several studies used similar approaches and compared the results from both flow cytometry and mass spectrometry in Immunological studies for monitoring of human cancer clinical trials [50], quantifying markers for diagnosis of Alzheimer’s [51], and measuring human hepatic transporter P-gp and OATP1B1 in hepatocytes [52].",
        "From combined uncertainty analysis at approximately 95% confidence level, the lowest mean CD19 ABC value was obtained for PBMC-A, followed by PBMC-B and PBMC-C (red bars in Fig 3). The differences observed with the CD19 ABC values between different PBMC preparations could be related to different purification procedures from fresh, healthy whole blood samples and cell lyophilization or dried-down processes used by manufacturers. PBMC-A was trehalose sugar stabilized, unfixed lyophilized cells [53], while PBMC-B and PBMC-C were both formaldehyde-fixed mononuclear cells. After fixation, PBMC-B went through a drying process while PBMC-C was lyophilized. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that damaged and/or broken microvilli due to lyophilization process without fixation is most likely the underlying reason for low CD4 receptor density on Cyto-Trol cells (PBMC-A) respective to cryopreserved PBMC and fresh whole blood [42]. The same underlying reason could be hypothesized for the low CD19 ABC value obtained for Cyto-Trol cells (PBMC-A). Fixation prior to the lyophilization and cell drying processes could likely preserve some cell membrane structures and hence receptor epitope structures for enabling antibody binding to the CD19 receptors in PBMC-B and PBMC-C.",
        "Currently these reference reagents are not commercially available in large quantities to serve as reference standards on a global level. These references are limited to the laboratory and need to be newly validated regularly. Users should consider the variabilities resulting from different lots of PBMC and antibody reagent when utilizing cell-based reference materials for quantification purposes and perform bridging studies to ensure harmonization between the results before switching to a new lot.",
        "A full understanding of the sources of uncertainty, their relative contributions and areas of improvement may lead to the production of high-quality and robust reference materials for quantitative marker measurement for many application fields that are not only limited to flow cytometry. Because of the urgent need for cell reference materials for quantitative cytometric expression analysis of important clinical biomarkers, this study was designed to assess measurement variability arising from three commercially available PBMCs and external factors such as antibody reagent lots, and operators and experimental days. As candidate reference materials for CD19 expression, this uncertainty quantification is a prerequisite for directing future development of corresponding measurement standards. Though large uncertainties associated with CD19 ABC values were quantified at approximately 95% confidence level (Fig 3), this is the first time that such effort has been taken. The CD19 ABC values obtained by flow cytometry are also consistent with measurements obtained from CyTOF technology (blue and green bar in Fig 3). Importantly, the contributions from various sources of uncertainty for expression analysis beyond the designed variables specified above were quantified. The importance of analysis of the sources of uncertainty is illustrated by our finding that the primary source of variability is in the antibody reagent (Fig 4). These analysis results show needed areas for improvement, e.g. cell and reagent manufacturing, to enable the production of better cell reference materials in the future. In addition to commercially available PBMCs as potential sources of reference materials, cell lines and synthetic microbeads such as synthetic PBMCs particles will be investigated in the future using the same characterization scheme implemented in this study. The use of cultured cell lines will be conducted in order to determine the effect of additional variables in the expression analysis due to differences that might be seen in cell viability, morphology and cell sizes with different passage number.",
        "The expression levels of CD19 on B cells were quantified as well as their respective associated uncertainties for three commercial lyophilized or dried-down PBMC preparations. The work is inspired by a consensus outcome from flow cytometry workshops that call for cell reference standards with well characterized antigen expression and immunophenotyping profiles for advanced cell manufacturing and cell therapies [36]. We envision that the PBMC-based materials in this study would be useful as expression analysis reference materials for quantifying disease and immunotherapy relevant B cell markers, e.g. CD19, CD20, and CD22. Quantitative measurement of these biomarkers with high confidence is critically important for the determination of proper treatment options and regimens, e.g. switching drug and applying a second dose of the same drug, and hence, prolonging the lifespan of cancer patients with B-cell malignancies.",
        "We are currently characterizing immunophenotyping profiles of these three different PBMC preparations that include cell subsets and T cell differentiation states. Once these PBMCs preparations are fully characterized, the users can base their application needs and tolerance of variability to choose a suitable reference PBMC material as their biological assay control for applications such as instrument set up/standardization, reagent quality control, antibody panel characterization, longitudinal studies across multi-instrument platforms and multi-centers. It’s worthy to note that these cell reference materials with assigned ABC values for CD19 and CD4 could be used for cytometric marker quantification beyond human blood T and B lymphocytes.",

        "Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), capable of indefinite self-renewal in vitro, hold remarkable promise in the era of regenerative medicine. Recently, a spectrum of pluripotency, ranging from the naive state to the primed state, has been shown to exist in murine PSCs.1 The establishment of a naive inner cell mass (ICM)-like murine embryonic stem cell (ESC) state and an epigenetically different primed murine epiblast stem cell state (mEpiSC) has provoked investigation toward a similar spectrum in human cells. Compared to the primed state, cells in the naive pluripotent state are more amenable to genome editing, present higher proliferative rate, and have higher chimeric integration potential.1 Substantial effort has been geared toward reproducing and stabilizing this paradigm in human and other primate PSC systems.",
        "Distinct from transient and progressive embryonic development in vivo, in vitro capture of the naive and primed states represents a snapshot of embryonic development. Table 1 provides a brief summary of the common differences between the two states.",
        "Murine ESCs, derived from the preimplantation epiblast of developing blastocysts, indefinitely self-renew in the presence of LIF/Stat3 signaling and serum are generally believed to “represent immortalization of the naive epiblast”.1 Murine ESCs have been shown to integrate into the pre-implantation epiblast and effectively contribute to chimera formation. Activation of the autoinductive FGF/MAPK signaling pathway can destabilize the mESC state, restricting lineage commitment abilities.2 Simultaneous inclusion of the growth factors LIF and Erk/Gsk inhibitors (commonly referred to as LIF/2i) is often used to stabilize the naive-state mESCs and even derive mESCs from genetically nonpermissive mouse strains.1 KLF2/4 and Esrrb3 are all further upregulated in the naive state compared to the primed state.",
        "In contrast, mEpiSCs, derived from the postimplantation epiblast, present a rewired pluripotency transcriptional network compared to the naive state.4 Specifically, conventional mEpiSC culture is stabilized by exogenous stimulation of FGF2 and Activin A pathways. EpiSCs do not depend on LIF/Stat3 signaling for self-renewal. In fact, several key pluripotency factors, including KLF4, and Stella are all downregulated in the primed state.3 The epigenetic differences between the naive and primed states offer a good model for studying cell state changes. Naive mESCs are characterized by diminished H3K27me3 signal at gene promoters, a histone modification linked to gene silencing, relative to their primed counterparts.5 The naive state also shows that both X chromosomes are active in female cells. Additionally, bivalent domains, the coexistence of both the active H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 marks, are preferentially located at the promoters of lineage-specific genes in the primed state, leaving these genes poised for expression. However, the naive state exhibits a decreased amount of H3K27me3 at bivalent domains, as well as fewer bivalent domains overall compared to the primed state, suggesting that bivalent domains in naive cells become resolved as the cells partially differentiate to the primed EpiSCs.5 The naive state is also characterized by global DNA hypomethylation compared to the hypermethylated primed state. Through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, both Ficz et al6 and Habibi et al7 observed rapid and genome-wide hypomethylation for both 5mC and 5hmC in mouse ESCs grown in 2i conditions compared to their primed counterparts. In addition, von Meyenn et al8 provided mechanistic insight by attributing the global DNA hypomethylation to the synergistic effect from a combined reduction of UHFR1/H3K9me2 and impaired recruitment of the DNA methylation maintenance machinery.",
        "Established, conventional hESCs closely cluster to the murine primed state. Conventional hESC culture relies upon FGF/Activin signaling pathways.9 hESCs often express high levels of NANOG; subsequent inhibition of NANOG results in a collapse of pluripotency in the primed state.10 Additionally, primed hESCs present an increase in DNA methylation and X chromosome inactivation.11 Naive-state hESCs, on the other hand, may express downregulated XIST transcription and a nearly complete lack of H3K27me3 nuclear foci. Human ESCs grown in reprogramming conditions have previously demonstrated significant reduction in CpG methylation, as well as downregulation of de novo DNA methyltransferase enzymes DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and DNMT3L.12 Additionally, naive hESCs may present a significant reduction of H3K27me3 in promoter and gene body regions over developmental genes when compared to the human primed state, as well as fewer bivalent domains overall.13 Global gene expression profiles have determined that naive hESCs had a significant downregulation of lineage commitment genes and grouped closer to human ICM than to primed cells. Furthermore, while hESCs express E-cadherin, a more prominent surface expression of E-cadherin is present in the naive state compared to the primed state, which is consistent with the enhanced single-cell survival of the naive state.11",
        "Initial attempts at deriving naive hESCs utilizing transgene expression and/or exogenous signaling pathway modulators were largely met with low efficiency and instability. Hanna et al11 initially reprogrammed secondary human fibroblasts using doxycycline (DOX)-inducible lentiviral vectors encoding OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 in 2i/hLIF growth conditions. Subsequently, constitutive expression of transgenic OCT4/KLF4 or KLF4/KLF2 was capable of generating DOX-independent lines. Derived lines exhibited epigenetic reversion similar to mESCs, including downregulated XIST transcription. Wang et al14 also reported successful reprogramming of human dermal fibroblasts. Notably, the expression of RARG/LRH-1 in addition to OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and C-MYC greatly increased reversion efficiency. Subsequently, Chan et al15 reported exogenous inclusion of 2i/hLIF, dorsomorphin (a BMP inhibitor), and high doses of FGF2 and TGFβ1 successfully reprogrammed multiple primed hESC lines. While the 3iL hESCs displayed upregulation of Stella, NANOG, and Pou5F1 as early as four days after treatment, X chromosome reactivation did not occur. In another variation presented by Theunissen et al,16 a 5i/LIF/FGF/Activin A system composed of additional BRAF, ROCK, and SRC inhibitors reset human fibroblasts screened via OCT4 distal enhancer activity, a trademark of the naive state. The cocktail of inhibitors resulted in cells with higher NANOG mRNA, as well as a globally lower H3K27me3 signal than their primed counterparts. DNA sequencing analysis of the converted cells was marked by a reduced H3K27me3 signal at bivalent domains, consistent with the naive state. However, these 5i ground-state cells displayed an upregulation of XIST, indicating incomplete reactivation of the chromosome, as well as abnormal karyotyping upon conversion.",
        "Takashima et al also reported that ectopic expression of KLF2/NANOG with 2i/LIF/aPKCi conditions could reset primed PSCs grown on MEFs.17 The resulting naive cells displayed increased mitochondrial respiration, indicative of cells in the ICM. Furthermore, reset cells underwent epigenetic reorganization. Naive-state cells presented notably lower 5mC and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine signal globally, as well as more than 50% loss of CpG methylation. Consistent with X chromosome activation, H3K27me3 foci were almost entirely lacking in reset female cells. The cells produced by Takashima et al maintained the naive-state transcription circuitry and clustered closely with naive mESCs, characterized by robust NANOG, KLF4, and TFCP2L1 expression. The Smith group further claimed that naive-state hESCs exhibited FGF/Activin A signaling independence. However, the feeder-dependent growth could potentially confound their claims. Valamehr et al18 reported the reversion of primed hESCs via episomal induction of OCT4/SOX2/SV40LT in combination with stage-specific medium supplementation. Ware et al13 also reported the maintenance of a directly derived naive hESC from the preimplantation blastocyst that is dependent on the inclusion of an FGF inhibitor and 2i/LIF. While the resulting cell line could be grown for more than 60 passages and was confirmed via increased mitochondrial metabolism, X chromosome activation, microRNA patterns, and complete ERK inhibition seemed to negatively affect line viability.",
        "Further research into reversion procedures also call upon the use of p38i, JNKi, and FGF2/Tgfβ1 cytokine supplementation as additional positive stabilizers for reprogramming of naive hESCs.19 Converted naive hESCs subsequently displayed XIST downregulation and X chromosome reactivation, as evidenced by a nearly complete lack of H3K27me3 nuclear foci. Chromatin mapping of reset cells showed a significant decrease of both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks across all gene promoters and bodies, with a notable emphasis over developmental genes. However, separate groups attempting to replicate these reversion procedures discovered abnormally downregulated or abolished expression of key pluripotency factors, suggesting cellular differentiation.16 As new key pathways are identified, they will have to be worked into existing reprogramming models. Table 2 summarizes the different reprogramming schemes.",
        "Despite accumulating efforts in generating stable naive hESCs, substantial obstacles remain, preventing the rapid assimilation of the naive state.",
        "It has since become clear that pluripotency lies upon a spectrum, on which many factors coincide and affect cellular characterization (ie, genetic background, epigenetic features, etc.).1 Lack of a standard for defining the naive state raises concerns regarding the true identity of any resultant cell lines. Notably, many of the aforementioned reversion protocols successfully reproduced some, but not all, of the characteristics of the naive state. How can these cells be proven to accurately capture the corresponding developmental stage? Further elaboration on the role of the inhibitors and activated pathways can present clearer guidelines for the definition of the ground state. It is our belief that any potential naive-state candidate must be subjected to a rigorous and intensive analytical process, combining transcriptome and epigenomic profiling to prove stabilization and pluripotency. Furthermore, future studies should elucidate the underlying mechanisms for in vivo and in vitro distinctions.",
        "The possibility that the murine model is more permissive for stabilizing the pluripotent paradigm compared to other models should also be considered.20 Knowledge of underlying permissive genes or factors in the murine model could be adapted to mammalian culture to allow for increased efficiency in reversion and stabilization. Additionally, it remains a possibility that mechanical stimulants surrounding the pluripotent cells can play a role in their propagation and stabilization. Further research should seek to elucidate the effect of mechanostimulants on naive-state reversion and propagation.21 Successful stabilization of the naive state in human ES culture may ultimately be subject to considerable growth condition modification.",
        "In combination with recent advances in CRISPR-Cas9 genomic engineering techniques, human naive ESCs sit as a significant gateway to understanding the human embryonic developmental process.22 In particular, preliminary reports suggest that the preimplantation state is capable of more efficient directed differentiation, opening a gateway toward application in cell therapies and cellular development. Naive-state cells, which exhibit higher global hypomethylation, are potential candidates for resolving the issue of residual memory in human iPSCs.23 Enhanced chimeric capability in the ground state could alternatively present a promising method for studying embryonic development and lineage specification in vivo.24 Finally, the successful capture of the naive state paired with the appropriate exogenous and endogenous conditions could prove to be a viable solution to some of the most pressing issues facing regenerative medicine, such as lack of differentiation efficiency and low cellular yields for transplantation.25 It is our firm belief that further research into the role of critical regulatory factors such as KLF4/TFCP2L1 could identify significant pathways to stabilize the naive PSCs. It is conceivable that the generation of a stable ground state could accelerate development of regenerative therapies targeting a host of illnesses, including bone loss, diabetes, and neurological disorders.",

        "Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) (1), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) (2) and bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system (3) have achieved great success in introducing site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) with high accuracy and efficiency. They have been developed into versatile tools to introduce a broad range of genomic modifications, such as targeted mutation, insertion, large deletion or gene knock-out, in various prokaryotic, eukaryotic cells and organisms (4). Among these tools, CRISPR/Cas9 has rapidly gained popularity due to its superior simplicity (5,6). In this system, a single guide RNA (sgRNA) complexes with Cas9 nuclease, which can recognize a variable 20-nucleotide target sequence adjacent to a 5′-NGG-3′ protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and introduce a DSB in the target DNA (7,8). The induced DSB then triggers DNA repair process mainly via two distinct mechanisms, namely, the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways.",
        "The NHEJ pathway repairs DNA DSBs by joining the broken ends through a homology-independent mechanistically flexible process, which often results in random small insertions or deletions (indels) (9). Thus, CRISPR/Cas9-introduced DNA cleavage followed by NHEJ repair has been exploited to generate loss-of-function alleles in protein-coding genes (10). In contrast, the HDR pathway mediates a strand-exchange process to repair DNA damage accurately based on existing homologous DNA sequences (11). Utility of this repair mechanism enables intentional replacement of endogenous genome segments with plasmid sequences, allowing targeted DNA insertion into genome and precise genetic modification in living cells. CRISPR/Cas9-introduced site-specific DNA cleavage greatly promotes HDR at nearby regions and enhances the efficiency of HDR-based gene targeting (12).",
        "In human cells, efficient knock-in of foreign DNA into a selected genomic locus has been long awaited. It is anticipated to facilitate various applications, ranging from gene function study to therapeutic genome editing. Currently, most studies have focused on HDR-based strategies, and the rate of targeted integration was reported to be low (13). This is because HDR in human cells is intrinsically inefficient, whereas NHEJ-mediated DNA repair is prevalent (14). These properties result in generation of few target clones amid a large number of random integrations. Notably, in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (15) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (16), which are pluripotent and possess unprecedented potentials for basic research and cell-based therapies (17), gene targeting via HDR is found to be particularly difficult and has impeded the application of these cells (18,19). Even in the presence of ZFN, TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9, the efficiency of HDR-based gene targeting in human pluripotent stem cells is found to be consistently low (20,21). In a recent study by Merkle et al., the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-induced HDR-mediated knock-in was estimated to be around 1 × 10−5 without pre-selection (19). Hence, technical expertise for sophisticated selections and cumbersome screening of a large number of clones are required to obtain genetically modified cells (19,21–23).",
        "To date, it still remains unclear whether the extremely low efficiency of HDR is a feature unique to human pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, it has not been investigated whether the prevalent NHEJ repair can be employed to mediate high-efficiency knock-in in a wide range of human cells, especially in ESCs. In order to address these questions, we constructed a universal reporter system, by targeting the GAPDH locus in human genome with a promoterless fluorescent reporter. Through systematic investigation into the potentials of both HDR and NHEJ repair in mediating CRISPR/Cas9-induced reporter integration, we demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9-induced NHEJ can mediate reporter knock-in more efficiently than HDR-based strategy, in various human cells types including human ESCs. This finding paves a new path for efficient genome editing in human ESCs and somatic cells, and it offers a great potential in their subsequent applications.",

(B) FACS analysis of H1 human ESCs, showing HDR-mediated integration of 2a-copGFP in the presence of Cas9 and sg-1, 2 or 3. Human ESCs were co-transfected with donor/Cas9/sgRNAs by nucleofection, and analyzed four days after transfection. X and Y-axis denote levels of GFP signal and forward scatter area, respectively. (C) FACS results showing varied frequencies of HDR-mediated 2a-copGFP knock-in in different human cell lines. 2a-copGFP(+HAs) donor and Cas9 were co-transfected, with or without sg-1, into eight human cell lines. GFP+ cells from the Cas9/sg-1 targeted cells (green signals gated to the right of the dashed line in each panel) were sorted for further analysis. To compare with the fully functional Cas9, nickase Cas9D10A were co-transfected with 2a-copGFP(+HAs) donor and sg-1 in selected cell lines, and the FACS results were shown in the column 3 and 6. (D) Genome PCR analysis of GFP+ cells produced with Cas9/sg-1 in C. Primer binding sites are indicated in A. Primer pair F1/R1 and F2/R2 amplify the 5′-junction (1350 bp) and the 3′-junction (1473 bp) of the 2a-copGFP integration, respectively. Primers F1/R2 amplified two DNA fragments that represent the wild type (2480 bp) and modified alleles (3241 bp). All amplified DNA fragments exhibited the expected sizes, indicating correct integration of 2a-copGFP via HDR into the genome. (E) Sequencing results of the PCR fragments amplified from the junctions. Expected modifications were confirmed at both 5′- and 3′-junctions, indicating precise integration of 2a-copGFP through HDR-mediated repair.",
        "Consistent with previous studies (19,23), we observed HDR-mediated reporter integration at a low frequency in H1 human ESCs. In the absence of either sgRNAs or Cas9, no GFP+ cells were detected within 105 cells. When the 2a-copGFP(+HAs) donor plasmid was co-transfected with Cas9 and sg-1, 2 or 3, GFP+ cells were observed at frequencies of 0.17–0.36% (Figure 1B) with a transfection efficiency at 53.5% (Supplementary Figure S1B). Variation in targeting efficiencies may reflect the intrinsic properties of different sgRNAs, as indicated by T7E1 assays (Supplementary Figure S1C).",
        "On the other hand, the analysis using this reporter system revealed varied but generally higher efficiencies of CRISPR/Cas9-induced HDR-mediated knock-in in human somatic cell lines. In the presence of Cas9/sg-1, immortalized human cells LO2 showed a targeting efficiency at 5.97%, whereas HK2 and HEK293T cells produced 1.61% and 1.80% GFP+ cells (Figure 1C). Among the human cancer cell lines examined, BEL-7402, BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 exhibited a targeting efficiency of 1.87%, 1.49% and 4.43% respectively; while H1299 and HCT116 produced 1.60% and 2.59% GFP+ cells, respectively (Figure 1C). Genome PCR and sequencing analysis of the sorted GFP+ cells showed that the 2a-copGFP indeed integrated precisely at the GAPDH 3′-UTR in the genome (Figure 1D,E), which supported that the targeting processes were mediated by the HDR pathway. Transfection efficiency in these somatic cell lines ranged from 50.0% to 73.5% (Supplementary Figure S1D); while frequency of indels induced by Cas9/sg-1, which indicates its genome-targeting activity, ranged from 6.8% to 50.1% in different cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1E). No apparent correlation was observed among the transfection efficiencies, Cas9/sg-1 targeting activities and HDR-mediated knock-in efficiencies. Compared to the fully functional Cas9, nickase Cas9D10A induced reporter knock-in at a lower efficiency (Figure 1C).",
        "Together, these data showed that the HDR-mediated DNA integration occurred at varied frequencies in different human cell types; the knock-in frequency was indeed lower in human ESCs than that in somatic cells, by approximatively 10–20 fold.",
        "To explore the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-induced NHEJ in mediating DNA integration (non-homology (NH)-targeting), we constructed two donor plasmids that carry promoterless ires-eGFP, but without homology sequences to the GAPDH locus (Figure 2A). In these NH-donors, we inserted a single sgRNA (sg-A) target site at 5′ of ires-eGFP (single-cut donor), or two sg-A sites at both sides of ires-eGFP (double-cut donor), to introduce cleavage for desired integration and to generate ires-eGFP fragments in different lengths (Figure 2A). The ires element was used to bypass any frameshift caused by NHEJ-introduced indels and to ensure GFP expression after reporter integration.",
        "Homology-independent knock-in of reporter genes into CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSBs in genome. (A) Schematics of the donor plasmids and targeting strategy for CRISPR/Cas9-induced homology-independent insertion of the ires-eGFP reporter at the GAPDH 3′-UTR. Two NH-donor plasmids were generated; one plasmid (left panel) carries a single sg-A target site at the 5′ of ires-eGFP reporter (single-cut donor), and the other (right panel) carries two sg-A target sites at both the 5′ and 3′ sides of ires-eGFP (double-cut donor). Dashed lines indicate positions of DSBs introduced and the cleaved genome and plasmids rejoined. (B) FACS analysis of LO2 cells showing homology-independent knock-in of the ires-eGFP reporter, induced by different combinations of donor plasmids and sgRNAs in the presence of fully functional Cas9. The top row shows the targeting results produced with single-cut NH-donor/Cas9/sg-A/sg-1, 2 or 3, while the middle row shows the results obtained when the double-cut donor plasmid was used. Controls without sg-A are shown in the bottom row. GFP+ cells are gated to the right of the dashed line in each panel. (C) FACS analysis showing no detectable reporter integration in LO2 cells when nickase Cas9D10A was used instead of fully functional Cas9, either with the single- or the double-cut NH-donor plasmid. (D) Genomic PCR of GFP+ cells sorted from samples in B. Positions of primers used for junction detection are indicated in A. PCR amplifications showed DNA fragments at expected sizes, indicating correct integration of the ires-eGFP donors at the GAPDH 3′-UTR. (E) The upper panel shows the schematics of sg-1, 2 and 3 target sites in the GAPDH genomic locus, sg-A target site in the single-cut NH-donor, and the positions of cleavage and rejoining between the genome and the donor DNAs. The lower panel shows sequences of the integration junctions amplified from GFP+ cells produced with the single-cut donor (in D, left panel). 5′- and 3′-junctions of sg-1, 2 or 3-induced integrations were analyzed separately. For each junction, multiple sequences are shown. Nucleotides of different sgRNA target sites and PAMs are color-coded. Sequences from donor templates are shown in gray and the genomic DNA sequences flanking the integration junction are shown in black.",
        "We co-transfected these NH-donor plasmids with Cas9/sg-A/sg-1, 2 or 3 into LO2 cells. Intriguingly, we detected a high frequency of reporter insertion when the single-cut donor was used. GFP+ cells were detected in the presence of sg-1, 2 or 3 at a frequency of 16.41%, 20.99% and 15.05%, respectively (Figure 2B, top row). The targeting efficiencies decreased with all sg-1–3 when the double-cut donor vector was used to produce a shorter ires-eGFP fragment (Figure 2B, middle row). Importantly, no obvious reporter knock-in could be detected in the absence of either sg-1–3 or sg-A (Figure 2B, left column and bottom row), or when nickase Cas9D10A was used to introduce single strand breaks (SSBs; Figure 2C). This indicated that, unlike HDR-based knock-in, site-specific DSBs in both genome and donor DNAs are stringently required for reporter knock-in at a selected genomic locus via the NH-targeting.",
        "PCR analysis of GFP+ cells produced with the single-cut donor verified the integration of ires-eGFP fragment together with vector backbone at the GAPDH 3′-UTR in the genome (Figure 2D, left panel). Similarly, in the GFP+ cells produced with double-cut donor, PCR analysis confirmed the genomic insertion of the short ires-eGFP fragment, which was located between the two sg-A target sites (Figure 2D, right panel). Sequencing analysis of integration junctions in both types of GFP+ cells confirmed the cleavage by specific sgRNAs as well as the rejoining between genome and donor templates at the cleavage sites (Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure S2), suggesting that the integrations indeed occurred at Cas9/sgRNA-induced DSB sites.",
        "To explore whether this NH-targeting approach could produce stable knock-in clones at high efficiency, we expanded the cells transfected with single-cut NH-donor/Cas9/sg-A/sg-2 and 3 at a low density. Among the colonies raised from the unsorted cells, we observed pure GFP+ clones (Supplementary Figure S3A). Among 90 clones randomly isolated from the cells transfected with sg-2, 13 were found to be GFP+ (14.44%). PCR and sequencing analysis confirmed that these clones indeed carried the correct reporter knock-in in their genomes (Supplementary Figure S3B,C), suggesting a success in generating stable knock-in clones without any pre-selection.",
        "To further uncover the molecular basis underlying these homology-independent reporter integrations, we generated DNA ligase IV (LIG4) knock-out LO2 cells by deleting large pieces of the LIG4 CDS using Cas9/sgRNAs (Figure 3A). In the two LIG4 knock-out clones examined, we observed drastic decrease of reporter knock-in after transfection with the single-cut NH-donor/Cas9/sg-A/sg-2, as compared to that in wild type LO2 cells (Figure 3B, left panel, top row). Moreover, the decrease of NH-targeting in these LIG4 null cells could be rescued by a plasmid carrying LIG4 overexpression cassette (Figure 3B, left panel, bottom row). Consistent with the recent studies by Maruyama et al. (28) and Chu et al. (29), we also observed a significant increase of the HDR-based knock-in of 2a-copGFP reporter in these LIG4 null cells (Figure 3B, right panel), which correlated with the loss of NHEJ activity. Collectively, these data showed that the homology-independent reporter integrations observed were indeed largely mediated by the conventional DNA ligase IV-dependent NHEJ pathway.",
        "Conventional NHEJ repair mediates efficient knock-in of large reporter genes. (A) Upper panel shows the schematics of the sgLIG4-i–iv target positions at the LIG4 locus. These sgRNAs were combined and co-transfected with Cas9 into LO2 cells to generate LIG4 knock-out clones. Lower panel is the western blot, showing the loss of DNA ligase IV in the obtained LIG4 null clones, and LIG4 expression introduced by transfection of LIG4 cDNA construct into these cells. (B) FACS analysis of the LIG4 knock-out LO2 cells. Homology-independent knock-in was induced by single-cut NH-donor/Cas9/sg-A/sg-2, and HDR-based knock-in was introduced using 2a-copGFP(+HAs) donor/Cas9/sg-2, in both wild type as well as LIG4 knock-out LO2 cells. Drastic decrease of NH-targeting and rescue by LIG4 overexpression were observed in both LIG4 null clone #S16 and #T8 (left panel). Significant increase of HDR knock-in was also observed in LIG4 null cells (right panel). (C) FACS results showing NHEJ-mediated knock-in with large size donors. 12k and 34k NH-donors were co-transfected with Cas9/sg-A/sg-2 into wild type LO2 cells. Controls were transfected without sg-2 or sg-A. GFP+ cells are gated to the right of the dashed line in each panel. At the same time, constant GFP-expressing 12k (PB) and 34k (AD) GFP-vectors were transfected in parallel; and the transfection efficiencies examined at day 2 by FACS are shown at the lower panel. (D) PCR detection of the reporter integration in the transfected cells (unsorted) in C. Primer pair F3/R3 detected the 5′-junctions of the12k and 34k NH-donors integrated at GAPDH 3′-UTR. PCR amplifications showed DNA fragments at expected sizes.",
        "Next, we speculated that the linearized NH-donor or fragments might also integrate via NHEJ repair in the reverse direction and result in no GFP expression (Supplementary Figure S4A). Moreover, the cleavages at both sg-A target sites in the double-cut donor likely produced two fragments, which might compete for genomic integration and lower the efficiency of GFP+ integration (Supplementary Figure S4A, right panel). PCR analysis indeed confirmed the presence of these non-GFP expressing integrations (Supplementary Figure S4B). The detection of non-GFP expressing integrations in the sorted GFP+ cells, which carried the correct reporter knock-in in at least one allele, suggested that different integrations might occur at the two genomic alleles in a single cell. These data indicated that NHEJ-mediated knock-in is non-directional and non-selective, and GFP+ cells observed represented only a portion of cells that carried DNA integrations. This also explained why a lower rate of reporter knock-in was observed when the double-cut donor was used. Given that single-cut donor/Cas9/sg-A/sg-2 produced 20.99% GFP+ cells in LO2 cells (Figure 2B), together with non-GFP expressing events, the total frequency of NHEJ-mediated integration at the single target site deduced might reach up to 40%.",
        "Off-target effect is a general concern to all CRISPR/Cas9-based technology (30). Because of the homology-independent and non-directional nature, the NHEJ-mediated knock-in approach faces a higher chance to introduce DNA insertion at an off-target site than the HDR approach does. To evaluate the off-target effect, we searched for the potential off-target sites that contain ≤ 2 mismatches to the used sgRNAs, throughout the entire human genome (hg19). We found no strong off-target site for sg-A. For sg-1, 2 and 3 targeting GAPDH, we identified 15, 14 and 6 potential off-target sites respectively, and none of these off-targets are located in an exon of a known transcript (Supplementary Table S2). We further selected the top 3 off-targets of sg-2, and performed PCR analysis on off-target integrations. Among the 90 single-cell clones that were expanded previously, none were found to carry reporter integration at the off-target site #1, while integration at off-target site #2 and #3 were found in two and three clones, respectively. Compared with the number of correct knock-in clones obtained (13 out of 90; Supplementary Figure S3), these results indicated that off-target integrations might occur during the NHEJ-mediated knock-in, but at a much lower frequency than the on-target insertion.",
        "Furthermore, we examined whether the NHEJ-mediated knock-in could accommodate a larger insert. We constructed new plasmids named 12k and 34k NH-donors, by inserting the promoterless ires-eGFP reporter together with the 5′ sg-A target sequence into a large PiggyBac vector (12 kb) and an adenoviral vector (34 kb), respectively. These donors can be cleaved at the sg-A target sequence upon the co-transfection with Cas9/sg-A, thus providing linear donors that carry the ires-eGFP in a 12 kb or 34 kb backbone for NHEJ-based knock-in. After co-transfection with the Cas9/sg-A/sg-2, we detected 7.49% GFP+ cells with the 12k NH-donor, and 1.18% with the 34k NH-donor (Figure 3C, upper panel). Together with the 20.99% GFP+ cells observed using the single-cut NH-donor (4.6 kb; Figure 2B), it was apparent that the knock-in frequencies decreased when larger donors were used. This might be caused, at least partially, by the reduced transfection efficiencies of the larger plasmids (Figure 3C, lower panel). PCR analysis of the transfected cells further confirmed the correct knock-in of these large donors at the GAPDH locus (Figure 3D).",
        "To further clarify whether NHEJ repair facilitates DNA integration at a higher efficiency than HDR does, we constructed another donor plasmid that carries an identical ires-eGFP reporter flanked by homology arms to the GAPDH locus. The 5′ homology arm in this plasmid is longer than that in 2a-copGFP(+HAs) donor, covering the GAPDH stop codon as well as sg-2 and sg-3 target sites (Figure 4A, upper panel). When this donor, namely ires-eGFP(+HAs) donor-1, was co-transfected with Cas9/sg-1 in LO2 cells, we detected HDR-mediated reporter knock-in at 7.11% (Figure 4B, Supplementary Figure S5A–C). This frequency was comparable to that produced by HDR-targeting using the 2a-copGFP(+HAs) donor with Cas9/sg-1 (Figure 1C), but lower than that produced by NH-targeting using either single- or double-cut donor and Cas9/sg-1 (Figure 2B).",
        "Comparison between HDR- and NHEJ-mediated reporter knock-in. (A) Schematics showing a zoomed-in view of the sg-1–4 target sites and their positions on the genomic GAPDH locus, as well as the design of ires-eGFP(+HAs) Donor-1, 2, 2.A and 2.B plasmids. Homology arm regions used in the ires-eGFP(+HAs) donor-1 are highlighted in gray, and the HAs used in donor-2, 2.A and 2.B are highlighted in purple. Donor-2.A carries a single sg-A target site at the 3′, and Donor-2.B carries a sg-A target site at the 5′ of the ires-eGFP(+HAs) cassette. (B) FACS analysis of LO2 cells transfected with the ires-eGFP(+HAs) donor-1/Cas9 and sg-1, 2, 3 or 4. Due to the different target positions on the genome and the donor, sg-1 induced HDR-mediated knock-in; sg-2 and sg-3 induced NHEJ-based knock-in; and sg-4 mainly produced GFP+ cells via the HDR-based knock-in through the intact 5′ homology arm. (C) FACS analysis showing HDR-mediated knock-in with circular and linear donor templates. The ires-eGFP(+HAs) Donor-2, 2.A or 2.B were transfected together with Cas9/sg-1 or Cas9/sg-2. The Donor-2.A and 2.B were both examined in the presence of sg-A (linear) as well as in the absence of sg-A (circular). Cas9/sg-A cleaves the Donor-2.A at 3′ of the ires-eGFP(+HAs) cassette and the linearized Donor 2.A produced GFP+ cells via HDR-mediated knock-in. Distinctly, Cas9/sg-A cleaves the Donor-2.B at 5′ of the ires-eGFP(+HAs) cassette, and the linearized Donor 2.B produced high proportion of GFP+ cells via both NHEJ- and HDR-mediated knock-in. (D) FACS results showing NHEJ- and HDR-mediated reporter knock-in at ACTB, SOX17 and T gene loci. Upper panel shows the schematics of ires-eGFP and PGK-eGFP reporters used for knock-in at ACTB and SOX17 or T gene loci, respectively. Single-cut NH-donor was co-transfected with Cas9/sg-A/sgACTB-i or sgACTB-ii to target the ACTB locus (lower left panel, top two rows); while the CE NH-donor was co-transfected with Cas9/sg-A/sgSOX17-i, sgSOX17-ii or sgT-i to target the SOX17 or T gene loci (lower right panel, top two rows). ACTB HDR-donor carrying ires-eGFP, and SOX17 and T HDR-donors containing PGK-eGFP, were co-transfected with Cas9 and corresponding sgRNAs to examine the HDR-based knock-in (lower panel, bottom row). Control samples were transfected without gene-specific sgRNA or sg-A. FACS analysis for the tests at ACTB locus was performed at day 5 after transfection. Cells transfected with PGK-eGFP containing donors for the tests at SOX17 and T loci, were maintained for five passages before FACS analysis. GFP+ cells are gated to the right of the dashed line in each panel.",
        "Interestingly, when we co-transfected the ires-eGFP(+HAs) donor-1 with Cas9/sg-2 or sg-3, which targets to the 5′ homology arm in both genome and donor plasmid, GFP+ cells increased to 14.75% and 17.36% respectively (Figure 4B). These knock-in efficiencies were comparable to NH-targeting with the single-cut donor (Figure 2B, top row). Genome PCR and sequencing confirmed end-joining between genome and donor plasmids beyond the 3′ homology arm (Supplementary Figure S5A,B,D), suggesting that Cas9/sg-2 or sg-3 cleaved both genomic and donor DNAs, and induced NHEJ-mediated integration of the reporters. On the other hand, when Cas9/sg-4 was used to target the 3′ homology arm, GFP+ cells decreased to 10.06% (Figure 4B). Sequencing analysis detected no indels at the 5′-junctions (Supplementary Figure S5A,B,E), suggesting that the intact 5′ homology arms mediated HDR-based integrations, which explained the knock-in observed at a lower frequency.",
        "Next, we constructed the ires-eGFP(+HAs) donor-2 by using a shortened 5′ homology arm that does not contain the sg-2 and sg-3 target sites (Figure 4A, upper panel). This plasmid will not be cleaved by Cas9/sg-2 or sg-3 and can only serve as donor for HDR-based knock-in. Indeed, co-transfection of Cas9/sg-2 with this new donor yielded 6.46% GFP+ cells (Figure 4C, top row). This frequency was much lower than the NHEJ-based knock-in introduced with ires-eGFP(+HAs) donor-1/Cas9/sg-2 (Figure 4B), while it was comparable to the HDR-mediated reporter integrations produced using Cas9/sg-1 together with either type of the (+HAs) donors (Figures 1C and 4B,C).",
        "To compare the NHEJ- and HDR-based knock-in in the identical conditions, we further examined HDR-mediated reporter insertion using a linearized donor. We constructed the ires-eGFP(+HAs) donor-2.A and donor-2.B, by inserting a sg-A target sequence at the 3′ or 5′ of the ires-eGFP(+HAs) cassette, respectively (Figure 4A). These donors thus can be cleaved at the sg-A target site by Cas9/sg-A to provide linear templates carrying homology arms. Using the ires-eGFP(+HAs) donor-2.A in presence of sg-A, we observed 7.30% GFP+ cells with sg-1, and 7.42% with sg-2 (Figure 4C, third row), which were indeed higher than the results obtained using circular donors (Donor-2, or Donor-2.A and 2.B without sg-A; Figure 4C, top, second and fourth rows). These frequencies, however, were still much lower than that produced through NHEJ-based reporter knock-in (Figure 2B, top row; and Figure 4B, with sg-2 and sg-3). Interestingly, using the ires-eGFP(+HAs) donor-2.B and Cas9/sg-A, we observed 19.75% GFP+ cells with sg-1, and 27.23% with sg-2 (Figure 4C, bottom row). It indicated that the linearized donor-2.B enabled NHEJ-based knock-in, and the high proportion of GFP+ cells likely represented a combinatory result of both NHEJ- and HDR-mediated GFP+ knock-in events.",
        "Collectively, these data are consistent with the results observed using 2a-copGFP(+HAs) donor (Figure 1C) or single-cut NH-donor (Figure 2B); and they clearly showed that the simultaneous introduction of DSBs in genome and donors induced targeted DNA integration via NHEJ, at a higher efficiency compared with that mediated by an HDR-based approach.",
        "Next, we examined whether the chromatin architecture in a local genomic context influences the efficiency of NHEJ-mediated reporter knock-in, by targeting another actively transcribed locus ACTB and several silenced gene loci, including SOX17, T, OCT4, NANOG and PAX6.",
        "We designed two sgRNAs targeting ACTB 3′-UTR to examine the HDR- and NHEJ-mediated knock-in at the ACTB locus. By co-transfecting the single-cut NH-donor/Cas9/sg-A together with sgACTB-i or sgACTB-ii, we observed GFP+ cells at 10.25% and 15.27%, respectively (Figure 4D, lower left panel, top row). Using the newly constructed ACTB HDR-donor, which carried the ires-eGFP flanked by homology arms to ACTB gene locus, we observed the HDR-based knock-in at 2.38% with sgACTB-i, and 8.60% with sgACTB-ii (Figure 4D, lower left panel, bottom row). Both the NHEJ- and HDR-based knock-in frequencies were comparable to that observed at the GAPDH locus.",
        "In order to examine knock-in at a silenced gene locus directly by FACS analysis, we employed the PGK-eGFP reporter (Figure 4D, upper right panel), which will express GFP after integration regardless whether the target locus is actively transcribed or not. We constructed a constant expression (CE) NH-donor which carries the sg-A target sequence at 5′ of the PGK-eGFP cassette; meanwhile, we generated sgRNAs targeting the SOX17 and T 3′-UTRs. It is noteworthy that because the expression of PGK-eGFP reporter is independent from integration orientations, the GFP+ cells observed in these assays represented knock-in events in either orientation. After transfected with the CE NH-donor/Cas9/sg-A and one of the gene-specific sgRNAs, the LO2 cells were maintained for five passages to eliminate the transient GFP expression before FACS analysis. Indeed, we detected 26.25% and 32.04% GFP+ cells for sgSOX17-i and sgSOX17-ii respectively, and observed 16.00% GFP+ cells with sgT-i (Figure 4D, lower right panel, top row). In contrast, only around 2–3% GFP+ cells were observed in the absence of gene-specific sgRNA; and around 1% GFP+ cells were detected in the absence of sg-A. Using this CE NH-donor, we also examine the NHEJ-mediated knock-in at various positions of OCT4, NANOG, T and PAX6 gene loci, which are largely silenced in LO2 cells. Indeed, we observed varied knock-in frequencies, which correlated neither with the target positions in a gene, nor the transcriptional status of the target loci (Supplementary Figure S6A,B), suggesting that the actual targeting efficiency was largely determined by the intrinsic properties of a sgRNA.",
        "Furthermore, we examined the HDR-based knock-in at the SOX17 and T genomic loci, using donor plasmids carrying PGK-eGFP flanked by homology arms to SOX17 or T genomic regions respectively. Similarly, the transfected cells were passaged for five times before FACS analysis. By transfecting the SOX17 HDR-donor together with Cas9/sgSOX17-i or sgSOX17-ii, we observed 1.30% and 2.83% GFP+ cells, which indicated the HDR-mediated knock-in at SOX17 locus; while usage of T HDR-donor together with Cas9/sgT-i produced 1.59% GFP+ cells (Figure 4D, lower right panel, bottom row). These frequencies were indeed much lower than that produced by the NHEJ-based knock-in at the same target sites (Figure 4D, lower right panel, top two rows). Moreover, they were also lower than the HDR-based knock-in observed in actively transcribed GAPDH and ACTB loci (Figure 4B,C and D, lower left panel, bottom row), which is consistent with previous studies showing that active transcription enhances homologous recombination (31,32).",
        "Collectively, these results indicated that CRISPR/Cas9-coupled NHEJ could mediate efficient knock-in at both active and silenced gene loci, and the efficiencies were higher than that produced by an HDR-based approach.",
        "Using the ires-eGFP donors with or without HAs, we examined the efficiency of NHEJ-mediated reporter knock-in in human ESCs. Indeed, the reporter knock-in observed was more efficient compared to that introduced using the HDR-based approach. Co-transfection of single-cut NH-donor/Cas9/sg-A/sg-1 produced 0.83% GFP+ cells, and the proportion of GFP+ cells increased up to 1.70% when sg-2 was used (Figure 5A, left panel). These NHEJ-mediated integrations indeed occurred at a higher frequency than the HDR-based knock-in, induced either by Cas9/sg-1–3 with the 2a-copGFP(+HAs) donor (Figure 1B), or by Cas9/sg-1 with the ires-eGFP(+HAs) donor-1 (Figure 5A, right panel, sg-1). Consistently, when we co-transfected the ires-eGFP(+HAs) donor-1 with Cas9/sg-2, which can simultaneously cleave both genome and donor DNAs and induce NHEJ-mediated donor integration, the yield of GFP+ cells increased to 0.93% (Figure 5A, right panel, sg-2). This insertion rate is also higher than that in HDR-targeting (Figure 1B and Figure 5A, right panel, sg-1), and closer to that produced with the single-cut NH-donor/Cas9/sg-A/sg-1 or sg-2 (Figure 5A, left panel). We further sorted the GFP+ cells produced with single-cut donor/Cas9/sg-A/sg-2. These cells maintained the human ESC morphology in culture and expressed the pluripotency markers OCT4 and TRA-1–60 (Figure 5B), suggesting that the NHEJ knock-in process did not interfere with the maintenance of pluripotency state, and it allows the generation of stable knock-in cells simply by FACS sorting.",
        "CRISPR/Cas9-coupled NHEJ mediates more efficient reporter knock-in than HDR in human ESCs and somatic cell lines. (A) Knock-in of ires-eGFP reporter via CRISPR/Cas9-coupled NHEJ repair in human ESCs. Left panel shows the NHEJ-mediated knock-in of ires-eGFP reporter. Both single-cut and double-cut NH- donors were examined in combination with sg-1 or sg-2. Right panel shows the reporter integration introduced with the ires-eGFP(+HAs) donor-1 and Cas9/sg-1, 2 or 4. Sg-1 and sg-4 mainly produced GFP+ cells via the HDR-based knock-in; while sg-2 induced NHEJ-based knock-in, due to the presence of sg-2 target site at the 5′-HA in the donor. FACS analyses were performed four days after nucleofection. GFP+ cells are gated to the right of the dashed line in each panel.

Percentages of GFP+ cells, presented as the mean ± s.d., were derived from three independent experiments. (D) Schematic diagram illustrating the balance between NHEJ- and HDR-mediated DSB repair in human cells, as well as the strategies (boxes) used for gene targeting.",
        "To verify whether the CRISPR/Cas9-coupled NHEJ-targeting strategy can knock-in the reporter into other genomic loci in human ESCs efficiently, we co-transfected the single-cut NH-donor/Cas9/sg-A together with sgRNAs targeting the OCT4 or ACTB genes at their 3′-UTRs. Both OCT4 and ACTB genes are actively transcribed in human ESCs; hence, knock-in of ires-eGFP reporter at their 3′-UTRs will produce GFP and allow direct analysis by FACS. Indeed, we observed 0.55% and 0.40% GFP+ cells in the H1 human ESCs transfected with sgOCT4-iv or sgACTB-ii, respectively (Supplementary Figure S7A). PCR and sequencing analysis on the OCT4 locus further confirmed the integration of single-cut donor at the target site (Supplementary Figure S7B,C). Collectively, these data showed that CRISPR/Cas9-coupled NHEJ repair can mediate efficient knock-in of reporter genes into a selected genomic locus in human ESCs.",
        "To compare in a broader range of human cells, we further quantified NHEJ- and HDR-mediated reporter knock-in in other human somatic cell lines. We found that, indeed, the NHEJ-based reporter knock-in was more efficient than HDR-mediated integration in all human somatic cell lines examined (Figure 5C). The ratio of GFP+ cells ranged from 2.76% in HCT116 cells to 18.42% in SMMC-7721 cells, when single-cut donor/Cas9/sg-A/sg-1 were used (Figure 5C). Interestingly, LO2, BEL-7402, and SMMC-7721 cells exhibited relatively higher efficiency in both NHEJ and HDR-mediated targeting, whereas, HCT116, H1299 and HK2 were relatively inefficient in both targeting strategies (Figure 5C). Notably, among all the cell lines examined, human ESCs showed the lowest efficiency in both NHEJ- and HDR-targeting (Figure 5C). These results implied that there may be intrinsic restrictions hampering efficient gene targeting in human ESCs, via either HDR or NHEJ repair. This observation is consistent with previous literatures (19,33–34), suggesting that human ESCs possess unique properties in repairing DNA damage. Therefore, further investigation is needed to uncover the deliberate mechanisms and resolve existing discrepancy regarding DNA repair in human ESCs.",
        "In summary, our results demonstrate that the NHEJ repair can enable efficient rejoining of genome and plasmids following CRISPR/Cas9-induced DNA DSBs, which permits knock-in of large DNAs at remarkably higher efficiency than HDR-mediated integrations, in all human cell lines examined. These data have established CRISPR/Cas9-coupled NHEJ repair as a valuable path for efficient knock-in in human ESCs and somatic cells (Figure 5D), providing great potential in biomedical research and therapeutic applications.",
        "Efficient knock-in of exogenous DNA is a highly desirable technology for studies carried out in human cells. Following previous far-reaching success in generating genetically modified mice (35,36), tremendous effort has been made to exploit HDR-mediated approaches for precise DNA insertion or replacement at a selected genomic locus (18,37). Even after the emergence of ZFNs, TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies, the competence and potential of other DNA repair mechanisms were not well explored, and most gene targeting studies still focused on HDR-mediated approaches to introduce genomic knock-in (19–21,23,28–29).",
        "In fact, NHEJ repair is predominant in mammalian cells. Random DNA integration via NHEJ has been widely used to generate transgenic animals and cell lines, and the frequency was estimated to be over-1000-fold higher than HDR-mediated DNA insertion (37). In the studies of HDR-based gene targeting using TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9, NHEJ-introduced indels were found to occur at a higher frequency than HDR-mediated reporter knock-in (38), and the prevalence of NHEJ-based knock-in was observed when single strand oligonucleotide donors were provided for HDR-mediated gene correction (39). However, very few studies have directly investigated the nature of these NHEJ-based integration processes, and their application potential as a biological technology has not attracted attention until recently. Following pioneer studies that showed the NHEJ-mediated capture of exogenous DNA at genomic DSBs (40), Orlando et al. (2010) first found that short oligonucleotides (<100 bp) could be inserted efficiently at ZFN-induced genomic DSBs via NHEJ repair (41). By introducing a ZFN or TALEN target sequence in donor plasmids, Cristea et al. and Maresca et al. (2013) further showed that simultaneous cleavage on both plasmid and genome DNAs by nucleases enabled targeted integration of large plasmid DNA at the genomic DSBs via NHEJ repair (42,43). This design was then coupled to CRISPR/Cas9 system for reporter knock-in in zebrafish (44–48) and Xenopus (49), in which, the HDR-mediated gene insertion was extremely inefficient. To date, the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-induced NHEJ in mediating large DNA insertion has not been systematically investigated in human cells, and the efficient knock-in in human ESCs still remains a challenge.",
        "In this study, we constructed promoterless fluorescent reporters targeted to the GAPDH locus in human genome. The ubiquitously active nature of the GAPDH gene enables GFP expression upon correct knock-in, allowing rapid assessment by FACS and direct comparison among different human cell types without any cumbersome process of raising single-cell clones. In addition, we employed a sg-A target site taken from prokaryotic DNA sequence, which has no homology to human genome, thus it makes the Cas9/sg-A universal in providing linearized donors for NHEJ knock-in and suitable for the direct comparison across multiple human cell lines. Using these reporter systems, with or without homology arms, we quantified the homology-dependent and independent reporter knock-in directly in various human cell lines. We found that, indeed, CRISPR/Cas9-coupled NHEJ mediates efficient DNA insertion when DSBs are introduced to both genome and donor DNAs; and the knock-in efficiency is much higher than that mediated by HDR-based approach, in all human cell lines examined. Our analysis using LIG4 null LO2 cells showed that the high-frequency homology-independent knock-in events were indeed largely mediated by the conventional NHEJ (C-NHEJ) pathway. Clonal expansion further demonstrated that, with this NHEJ-based targeting approach, stable knock-in clones could be generated in a fluorescence-independent selection-free manner. Together, these data suggest that CRISPR/Cas9-coupled NHEJ repair can provide a valuable path for efficient knock-in in human cells; meanwhile, the results obtained have established our reporter systems as valuable tools for rapid quantification of the HDR and NHEJ activities across different cell lines/clones, which could be useful for dissecting a given molecular pathway, or for screening of therapeutic compounds to restore the impaired DNA repair responsible for human diseases.",
        "In addition, we have unraveled distinct features of the NHEJ-mediated knock-in. Unlike the HDR-based DNA insertion, the NHEJ-based knock-in stringently relies on the presence of DSBs in both genome and donor DNAs; it allows integration at either orientation and it can accommodate insertion of large DNAs (up to 34 kb). Importantly, the homology-independent nature also rendered this NHEJ knock-in approach an advantage in targeting silenced genomic loci, which have been shown to be difficult to access through traditional HDR-based knock-in strategy (50,51). Currently, the CE-NH donor we employed still produced non-specific GFP signal due to transient expression and random integration; hence, further work is needed to improve the reporter design for knock-in at a silenced gene locus.",
        "On the other hand, we showed that the high-efficiency NHEJ knock-in approach could potentially introduce undesired DNA integration at low frequency, due to off-target cleavage by Cas9/sgRNA (30). It is possible that off-target integrations may also produce GFP if the target locus is actively transcribed or the PGK-eGFP reporter is used. Therefore, it is important to follow high-stringency criteria in sgRNA design for minimizing the off-target effect. Usage of the new Cas9 that has been further optimized to reduce off-target effect is also likely beneficial (52). Moreover, as shown by our results as well as by other studies (38,39), high-frequency NHEJ-mediated repair events may occur in many types of genome editing without being detected in a particular assay; hence, unwanted genomic modification should be considered and controlled during data analysis and interpretation. Together, to beware and to confine these limitations are important for further improving the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing technology, via either HDR- or NHEJ-mediated DNA repair.",
        "Interestingly, although the C-NHEJ machinery often introduces indels by repairing non-compatible or damaged DNA ends (9), the alternative NHEJ (A-NHEJ) pathway initiates a repair process by single-strand resection (9), and the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of Cas9 can also introduce deletions by trimming the DNA ends (7), we observed substantial precise ligations between cleaved plasmid and genome DNAs during the NHEJ-mediated knock-in (Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure S4). This is consistent to the analysis results on ZFN- or TALEN-induced DNA integration by Cristea et al. and Maresca et al. (42,43), as well as on CRISPR/Cas9-induced chromosomal inversions by Li et al. (53). These data, together with previous evidence on the precise repair by C-NHEJ (54,55), support that the C-NHEJ pathway can largely mediate precise ligation of DNA ends generated by engineered nucleases, prompting a greater potential of the NHEJ-mediated gene targeting in a wider range of applications.",

    "title": "Human chemically-derived hepatic progenitors (hCdHs) as a source of liver organoid generation: Application in regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and toxicology testing. induced pluripotent (iPSCs) to adult tissue-specific stem cells are commonly used to generate 3D liver organoids for modeling tissue physiology and disease. We have recently established a protocol for direct conversion of primary human hepatocytes (hPHs) from healthy donor livers into bipotent progenitor cells (hCdHs). Here we extended this culture system to generate hCdH-derived liver organoids for diverse biomedical applications. METHODS: To obtain hCdHs, hPHs were cultured in reprogramming medium containing A83-01 and CHIR99021 for 7 days. Liver organoids were established from hCdHs (hCdHOs) and human liver cells (hLOs) using the same donor livers for direct comparison, as well as from hiPSCs. Organoid properties were analyzed by standard in vitro assays. Molecular changes were determined by RT-qPCR and RNA-seq. Clinical relevance was evaluated by transplantation into FRG mice, modeling of alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), and in vitro drug-toxicity tests. RESULTS: hCdHs were clonally expanded as organoid cultures with low variability between starting hCdH lines. Similar to the hLOs, hCdHOs stably maintained stem cell phenotype based on accepted criteria. However, hCdHOs had an advantage over hLOs in terms of EpCAM expression, efficiency of organoid generation and capacity for directed hepatic differentiation as judged by molecular profiling, albumin secretion, glycogen accumulation, and CYP450 activities. Accordingly, FRG mice transplanted with hCdHOs survived longer than mice injected with hLOs. When exposed to ethanol, hCdHOs developed stronger ARLD phenotype than hLOs as evidenced by transcriptional profiling, lipid accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. In drug-induced injury assays in vitro, hCdHOs showed a similar or higher sensitivity response than hPHs. CONCLUSION: hCdHOs provide a novel patient-specific stem cell-based platform for regenerative medicine, toxicology testing and modeling liver diseases.

        "The liver is a vital organ that regulates several essential functions in the human body. It maintains its function through various processes, including lipid metabolism [1], drug detoxification [2], and glucose metabolism [3, 4]. The liver plays a central role in drug metabolism, making it a critical organ in pharmacological research. After a drug is absorbed into the bloodstream via oral or intravenous administration, the liver metabolizes, clears, and excretes most of the compound [2]. Assessing whether drugs accumulate in the body, impair the liver detoxification capacity, or induce hepatotoxicity is an important step in the development and safety verification of new drugs. However, the liver is frequently affected by toxic reactions during drug development [5]. Hepatotoxicity accounts for nearly one-third of the reasons why drug development projects are suspended, often leading to drug withdrawal from the market [6, 7]. When hepatotoxicity occurs, the resulting damage to hepatocytes and associated inflammatory responses can hinder regeneration, ultimately contributing to the development of chronic liver disease [8]. Also, the capacity of the liver is limited by the type of disease and extent of liver damage that can result from drugs, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcohol consumption, metabolic disorders, and liver cancer. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a significant concern, with an elevated risk of acute liver injury and liver failure. Studies from Europe and the United States have identified DILI as the primary cause of acute liver failure [9, 10]. Despite its prevalence, a reliable biomarker for the diagnosis of DILI remains unavailable. Delayed diagnosis is associated with increased mortality rates and poses a significant challenge to clinical management. Current hepatotoxicity assessment systems rely heavily on animal models and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) [11]. However, these models often fail to fully replicate the hepatotoxicity observed in clinical trials. Therefore, there is an urgent need for systems that can accurately assess hepatotoxicity in humans. Researchers are actively developing and using diverse model systems aimed at more accurately reproducing hepatotoxicity observed in clinical settings. These efforts are essential for improving the prediction and prevention of hepatotoxicity during drug development.",
        "Various models are currently used to evaluate hepatotoxicity for novel drug development, including in vivo, in vitro, and in silico models. Rodent models are widely used in vivo because of their favorable experimental properties and ability to replicate physiological phenomena analogous to those observed in humans. Rodent models are the cornerstone of preclinical trials for assessing hepatotoxicity and have been extensively used in research. However, the inherent limitations of rodent models should be recognized. Significant discrepancies exist between the physiological characteristics of rodents and humans, necessitating caution when extrapolating these findings to clinical contexts [12]. For instance, drugs such as ibuprofen (commonly used as an antipyretic and analgesic) and warfarin (an anticoagulant) are generally safe and effective in humans, but have been shown to produce harmful effects in rodent models [13, 14]. These differences arise primarily because of the difference in liver metabolism between humans and rodents [15–17]. To address these limitations, in vitro models based on human cells and in silico models are critical in hepatotoxicity research. This review introduces the various models currently used for hepatotoxicity evaluation, compares their strengths and limitations, and provides insights into the development of more effective models for hepatotoxicity assessment (Table 2).",
        "2D cell culture models are valuable resources for early hepatotoxicity assessment, offering important insights into the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. Cellular sources used for hepatotoxicity assessment include PHHs, immortalized cell lines such as HepG2 and HepaRG derived from liver cancer cells, and hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) differentiated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) [18, 19]. Over the years, 2D models derived from these cellular sources have been extensively used, evolving into a variety of in vitro systems, and continue to play a fundamental role in hepatotoxicity assessments (Table 1).Table 1In vitro models for hepatotoxicity assessmentsModelsAdvantagesDisadvantagesPHHsWidely used as a primary model for hepatotoxicity assessment due to its physiological relevanceHigh predictive accuracy for drug metabolism and toxicity assessmentNatural expression of Phase I/II enzymesLimited cell viability in vitroDifficult to reflect interindividual variabilityLimited availability due to the complexity of isolation processLoss of function due to dedifferentiation in vitroHepatic cancer cell lineEasy to culture and highly reproducibleLong-term expansion possibleSuitable for high-throughput screening (cost-effective)Useful for studying mechanisms of liver toxicityGenetically altered and metabolically abnormalLimited representation of normal liver physiology and drug metabolism pathwaysPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cellsUnlimited cell sourceCapability to model patient-specific genetics (iPSCs)Amenable to genetic engineering and disease modelingImmature hepatocyte-like phenotype compared to primary hepatocytesLower metabolic activityHigh variability between differentiation protocols and high costOrganoidMimics the 3D structure and multicellular composition of the liverLong-term expansion possibleReflects patient-specific feature, making possible for personalized medicineUseful for complex disease modelingComplex and time-consuming culture processHigh costVariability in organoid qualityOrgan-on-a-chipRecapitulates dynamic microenvironment with flow and mechanical stimulationHigh physiological relevanceAllows for real-time monitoringSuitable for studying organ interactionsTechnically complex setupHigh costLimited scalability for high-throughput applicationsRequires specialized expertiseBioreactorSupports long-term culture with dynamic conditionsAllows for scalability and controlled culture environmentEnhances hepatocyte function and maturationHigh operational complexityExpensive equipment and maintenanceLimited accessibility in standard laboratoriesRequires optimization for each cell type3D bioprintingCustomizable liver tissue structuresHigh spatial control over cell placementEnables integration of multiple cell types and ECM componentsPotential for large-scale tissue productionHigh cost of equipment and materialsComplex bioink formulation and printing processLimited maturity of printed tissues compared to native tissuesTime-consuming optimizationPHH, primary human hepatocyte; iPSC, induced pluripotent stem cell; 3D, three-dimensional; ECM, extracellular matrix",

        "PHHs are widely used as the gold standard for assessing hepatic metabolism and toxicity [20, 21]. Isolated PHHs have been shown to reproduce metabolic enzyme activity, glucose metabolism, urea secretion, albumin secretion, and in vitro detoxification [22]. Although various in vitro 2D models have been proposed for hepatotoxicity assessment, animal models and PHHs remain the primary tools for toxicity evaluation because of their superior functionality. However, there are several limitations to the use of PHHs as 2D models for hepatotoxicity assessment that need to be addressed. PHHs tend to lose their liver-specific functions during prolonged in vitro culture, including decreased cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme expression, which is strongly associated with detoxification. This decline makes PHHs less suitable for evaluating drugs that require extended treatment for toxicity assessment, such as acetaminophen (APAP) [23, 24]. In addition, PHHs cannot recapitulate the complex interactions between various cell types present in human liver tissue and the unique microenvironment of liver tissue, making it difficult to accurately reflect the physiological and molecular pathways of the liver in toxicity assessments. Furthermore, the difficulty of isolating PHHs and donor shortages pose significant challenges in establishing PHHs as reliable models for liver toxicity evaluation [25].",
        "Several new approaches and strategies have been developed to address these issues. Growth factors, cytokines, and supplements were added to the culture medium to enhance the functionality and viability of PHHs [26]. In addition, methods such as extracellular matrix (ECM) coating and co-culture with non-parenchymal liver cells, such as Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), have been used to better replicate the in vivo microenvironment of the liver tissue [27–29]. Despite these advancements, several limitations remain. The variability between batches of ECM coatings designed to recreate liver microenvironments introduces inconsistencies, making it difficult to obtain reliable results for toxicity assessments [30].",
        "Although PHHs have become the preferred cell source for liver toxicity assessments, the use of immortalized liver cancer cell lines as alternatives to address the limitations of PHHs has been proposed. This strategy helps mitigate issues related to donor variability and the limited availability of PHHs. Cell lines, such as HepG2, C3A, and HepaRG, established in the 1970s, are still widely used in current research [31–33].",
        "The HepG2 cell line offers several advantages, including nuclear transcription factor (Nrf2) expression, which plays an essential role in drug metabolism and toxicity [34]. In addition, it has an unlimited growth capacity and is easy to manipulate [35, 36]. However, a significant limitation of HepG2 cells, which are often used for liver toxicity assessments, is the lack of CYPs e expression. These enzymes are essential for the accurate evaluation of liver toxicity. The significantly low level of CYPs expression in HepG2 cells limits their ability to provide a comprehensive assessment of several liver toxicants, making them less reliable than PHHs or in vivo hepatocytes for toxicity studies [18].",
        "The C3A cell line, a subclone of HepG2, possesses several characteristics that distinguish it from its parent cell line. These features include increased albumin secretion, enhanced proliferative capacity, and the ability to grow in glucose-deficient media. However, similar to HepG2 cells, similar challenges in toxicity assessment owing to a lack of CYPs expression are faced by C3A cells [37]. Although recent advancements have led to the development of cell lines engineered to overexpress CYPs, some CYPs remain undetectable, thereby impeding comprehensive liver toxicity assessments in HepG2 cell lines [38, 39].",
        "The HepaRG cell line, derived from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has distinct characteristics compared to PHHs and HepG2-derived cell lines. HepaRG cells exhibit phase II enzymes and membrane transporter levels comparable to those of PHHs [18, 36, 40]. When cultured at low densities, HepaRG cells proliferated vigorously in an undifferentiated state. When they reach a certain confluence, they form and differentiate into colonies of HLCs surrounded by biliary epithelial-like cells [41]. Notably, HepaRG cells exhibit enhanced expression of CYPs, overcoming the major limitations of HepG2 cell lines [18, 41]. The higher expression of CYPs in HepaRG cells may lead to increased susceptibility to metabolism-mediated toxicity compared to that in HepG2 cell lines [41]. In 2011, the HepaRG cell line, which is known for its ability to support long-term cultures and provide highly sensitive assessments, was used to study the mechanisms of APAP-induced toxicity. This approach, which requires prolonged exposure to evaluate liver toxicity, has been shown to be more effective than PHHs or HepG2 cell lines [42]. However, the HepaRG cell line requires longer culture periods and incurs higher costs than the HepG2/C3A cell line, primarily because of the extended differentiation period required for liver toxicity assessment. Consequently, efforts have been made to commercialize fully differentiated HepaRG cells that have been used in various studies [43–45]. However, the degree of differentiation and functionality in commercialized differentiated HepaRG cells does not fully replicate the conditions of PHHs, and inconsistencies in metabolic enzyme expression may arise, making them less predictive of liver toxicity than PHHs [18].",
        "Recent advancements in differentiating PSCs into HLCs have opened novel avenues for precision medicine, particularly for liver toxicity assessment, personalized patient treatment, and potential applications in regenerative medicine [46]. Unlike PHHs, PSCs are pluripotent, allowing them to differentiate into different cell types. This has led to ongoing efforts to differentiate these cells into various organs and HLCs in liver-related research. PSCs also exhibit high proliferation capacity, making them a promising solution to the supply and demand imbalance observed in the PHHs model. PSC-derived HLCs display more consistent expression of CYPs drug-metabolizing enzymes than cancer cell line-derived models. This consistency is particularly advantageous for carcinogenic toxicity assessments, which are difficult to perform in cancer cell lines with already cancerous and carcinogenic properties.",
        "PSCs were first established with the discovery of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [47]. ESCs have the capacity to proliferate for extended periods in culture while maintaining high telomerase activity and pluripotency, and have been investigated as an alternative cell source to PHHs. Studies have reported the use of ESCs to evaluate drug-induced liver toxicity, proposing novel models to address the limitations of the short viability observed in traditional 2D PHH models [48] One advantage of directly differentiating HLCs from ESC is that they are more homogeneous than PHHs, which can be affected by donor variability and extraction methods. This homogeneity helps reduce the variability in toxicity assessments [19]. However, because ESCs are obtained from the inner cell mass of fertilized embryos, their use is associated with ethical concerns.",
        "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are generated by reprogramming somatic cells to acquire pluripotency through the overexpression of specific transcription factors. The concept of mouse iPSCs was established through the introduction of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, also known as the Yamanaka Factor, into mouse somatic cells. This has led to the discovery of human iPSCs by reprogramming human somatic cells [49, 50]. Similar to ESCs, iPSCs can differentiate into HLCs under medium conditions supplemented with specific growth factors or combinations of chemicals [51–55]. These differentiated HLCs have been applied in a variety of studies, including toxicity assessments, and have facilitated advances in precision medicine, such as personalized therapy and drug sensitivity testing, which continue to be explored [19, 55]. A key advantage of iPSCs over ESCs is their ethical acceptability, as they are not derived from fertilized embryos, thus reducing the ethical concerns typically associated with ESCs. In addition, iPSCs can be reprogrammed from somatic cells. Isolating patient-derived somatic cells for reprogramming allows for patient-specific screening and personalized assessments. Despite these advantages, iPSC-derived HLCs have certain limitations that hinder their application in research. Most human cells undergo epigenetic modifications after differentiation, and the epigenetic memory of the original somatic cells used to generate iPSCs is often not fully erased [56, 57]. Notably, this epigenetic memory can distort the differentiation pathways of iPSCs, thereby complicating the optimization of iPSC-derived cells for research purposes [58–62]. This limitation can affect the intrinsic hepatocyte function and gene expression of the iPSC-derived HLCs used in research.",
        "The use of PSC-derived HLCs for liver toxicity assessment has been proposed as a model to address the fundamental limitations of conventional PHHs and cancer cell lines, such as difficulty in functionality maintenance and inconsistent expression of drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. However, PSC-derived HLCs exhibit lower maturity than PHHs, which remains the gold standard for liver toxicity assessment. In addition, batch-to-batch variability remains a significant challenge, as the culture conditions and protocols for the differentiation of PSCs to HLCs vary.",
        "Owing to the limitations of toxicity assessments in 2D single-cell line culture models, which fail to fully reproduce hepatic toxic metabolism in vivo, researchers have explored co-culture systems with non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) involved in hepatotoxic metabolism. Representative NPCs used in co-culture models include Kupffer cells, HSC, and sinusoidal endothelial cells. These cells were incorporated to better reflect the interactions between different cell types in the liver tissue and recreate the liver microenvironment [63–66]. Early co-culture models focused on co-culturing NPCs with primary rat hepatocytes (PRHs), whereas more recent studies have focused on co-culturing NPCs with PHHs [28, 29, 67, 68].",
        "A 2D co-culture model with Kupffer cells, which play a critical role in inflammatory cytokine secretion and toxicity responses, has been reported to increase both hepatocyte culture periods in vitro and liver-specific functions [66, 69, 70]. In addition to direct toxicity, certain drugs can activate Kupffer cells, thereby promoting the release of inflammatory cytokines that may damage liver cells [71–73]. By studying immune interactions using co-culture systems with Kupffer cells, drugs and toxins can be classified based on their immune-mediated effects and identify those at a higher risk of inducing liver damage [66]. This information will help in the early detection of potentially harmful compounds, improving the assessment of drugs, and toxicity evaluations. However, implementing these co-culture models using standard cell culture dishes is challenging and requires specialized knowledge to optimize the media conditions for the survival of various cell types [69].",
        "HSCs, which are not directly involved in liver toxicity assessments, play a significant role in the inflammatory response and subsequent fibrosis arising from chronic toxicity [74]. These characteristics of HSCs have been used as indicators of chronic toxicity. Theoretically, co-culturing HSCs with PHHs during prolonged exposure could enhance microenvironmental physiological functions compared with single-cell cultures of PHHs [70, 75]. However, co-culturing PHHs and HSCs in a 2D environment restricts their interactions and fails to replicate the 3D cellular microenvironment. Studies have reported that although hepatocytes initially exhibit increased activity of certain drug-metabolizing enzymes and hepatotoxicity responses, this activity decreases rapidly over time. [18, 23, 76]. In addition, similar to other 2D models, the lack of ECM support leads to reduced functionality and viability, which is a critical limitation of co-culture models [77–79].",
        "In summary, although co-culture methods have established a foundation for investigating the interactions between liver cells and their effects on liver physiology and toxic metabolism, fully replicating the liver microenvironment remains a challenge. Although hepatocytes in co-culture systems exhibit enhanced functionality and improved capacity to metabolize drugs and toxins compared to single-cell culture systems, the inherent limitations of 2D models still cause difficulties (Table 2).Table 2Comparison of hepatotoxicity assessment modelsModelsIn vivo modelsIn vitro 2D modelsIn vitro 3D modelsIn silico modelsCosts+++++++ + Time+++++++ + Ethical concerns++++ (ESC)+-Physiological relevance+++++-Scalability–+++++ + + + Complexity++++++ + Replicability+++++++ + Data output++++  + + Toxicologic sensitivity++++/++ (PHH)+++ + Toxicologic specificity++++/++ (PHH)+++ + AdvantagesClosest to human physiologyModels systemic interactionsProvide real-time data on whole-body effectsCan study chronic effectsEasy and inexpensiveHigh reproducibilitySuitable for high-throughput screeningSimple to implement in standard labsMimic tissue architecture and microenvironmentSupports long-term cultureCaptures cell–cell and ECM interactionsPersonalized model availableFast and inexpensiveNo ethical issuesAllows early screening and pathway predictionsScalable for big data analysisDisadvantagesAnimal ethical concernsHigh cost and time-consumingSpecies-specific differences limits translatabilityCannot study patient-specific effectsLimited availability of animals for chronic studiesLack of physiological complexityPoor representation of cell–cell and cell-ECM interactionsLimited ability to study dynamic drug metabolismTechnically demanding setupExpensiveVariability in 3D structure qualityScalability and throughput limitationsRequires accurate and high-quality datasetsPoor prediction of complex biological phenomenaLimited to known pathways and mechanismApplicationsWhole-body toxicologyPharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) studiesMechanistic studies of systemic effectsHigh-throughput drug screeningMechanistic hepatotoxicity studiesTesting of drug-drug interactionsGene expression analysisAdvanced hepatotoxicity studiesDisease modelingEvaluation of personalized drug responseEarly-stage virtual screeningToxicity prediction for large compound librairesMechanistic pathway analysisPredicting drug-drug interactionsLimitationsLimited scalabilityHigh variability between speciesEthical and regulatory restrictionsTime-intensive experimentsLimited predictive accuracy for in vivo outcomesInability to replicate the 3D liver structureLimited use for long-term studiesHigh variability in experimental protocolsRequires skilled personnelHigh cost compared to 2D modelsCannot replace experimental validationDependent on quality and extent of available dataLimited in understanding emergent or unknown biological mechanisms2D, two-dimensional; 3D, three-dimensional; ECM, extracellular matrix; ESC, embryonic stem cell; PK/PD, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics",

        "The use of animal models for hepatotoxicity evaluation is a valid approach because of their ability to identify intricate interactions in vivo that cannot be observed in 2D cell cultures. In addition, animal models are well-suited for the assessment of systemic metabolism and monitoring of long-term effects. Given their physiological similarities with humans, animal models are used to evaluate liver toxicity, as they can provide predictive insights into clinical outcomes. In addition, it has already been revealed that preclinical trials using animal models can predict approximately 70% of human toxicities observed during clinical trials [80].",
        "Liver damage models in animal studies have characteristics similar to those of human liver physiology; therefore, the results of this research have a high possibility for clinical applications. These models are essential for evaluating complex liver damage, including intricate biological processes such as drug metabolism pathways and immune responses. Animal models are widely used because of their ability to generate predictable and reproducible results. The criteria for establishing and selecting appropriate animal models for hepatotoxicity assessment vary depending on the purpose of the study, the specific type of liver damage being evaluated, and the characteristics of the drug. In the present study, we focused on animal models organized according to the type of liver damage to be evaluated. Rodent models offer various advantages, including small size, rapid reproduction, physiological similarities to humans, and ease of handling [81]. Although there are various preclinical animal models, such as primates, pigs, and rabbits, this study primarily addressed rodent models. Notably, the choice of model depended on the specific aim of the experiment. For example, models with genetic or disease-specific traits may be used, as required.",
        "DILI causes acute liver failure due to hepatotoxicity. DILI can be triggered by a wide range of drugs and requires prompt intervention, as it carries a significant risk of progressing to acute liver failure. Moreover, DILI is a frequently occurring toxicity in clinical practice and remains the primary reason for the discontinuation of drug development, highlighting the importance of developing predictive models of DILI [82]. DILI can be classified into two distinct categories. The first category is predictable, in which toxicity arises from the inherent chemical characteristics of the drug and follows a dose-dependent pattern [83]. The second category is dose-independent and unpredictable, and occurs even at low doses. This unpredictable category of DILI is relatively rare, and is postulated to be influenced by genetic variability. Intrinsic liver damage models have been used to examine the effects of substances such as APAP and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) on liver cells.",
        "Among rodent models, the APAP hepatotoxicity mouse model was first established in the 1970s [84]. In recent years, it has become common to rapidly induce APAP hepatotoxicity in mice using a single dose of 300 mg/kg APAP. The mechanism of APAP hepatotoxicity in humans is similar to that in mice, and the model effectively replicates the pathophysiology of human liver damage. However, rats were less sensitive to APAP than mice, displaying only mild hepatotoxicity even at a high dose of 1 g/kg APAP. Mechanistic analysis revealed no significant differences in APAP metabolism, protein binding, oxidative stress, or mitochondrial damage between rats and mice, limiting the suitability of the rat model for clinical relevance [85, 86]. In addition, the degree of liver damage in acute hepatotoxicity can vary depending on factors, such as sex and species. Studies have revealed that male mice are more sensitive to APAP, whereas female mice exhibit faster recovery of glutathione (GSH) levels after APAP exposure [87, 88]. Furthermore, to apply APAP mechanisms and sex, it is necessary to implement a fasting period of 12–16 h before administering APAP. This step assists in the depletion of hepatocyte GSH levels, creating conditions similar to those observed during APAP metabolism. Moreover, an appropriate experimental design is essential to obtain results that can be translated to actual patients [89]. This acute liver injury model using APAP has consistently demonstrated highly reproducible results that closely resemble human metabolism in numerous studies [90]. The development of an APAP-induced DILI mouse model based on the mechanism by which N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a reactive metabolite of APAP, induces hepatotoxicity by depleting GSH, led to the discovery of the antidote N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which has been used clinically for over four decades [91].",
        "ALD is a chronic condition characterized by liver damage resulting from excessive alcohol consumption. The disease progresses through several stages, including steatosis, hepatitis, liver fibrosis, and ultimately, cirrhosis. [92–94]. Because of the absence of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for ALD, further studies on the effects of drugs on the liver, particularly hepatotoxicity, are of critical importance. Evaluation of hepatotoxicity in ALD models is a crucial aspect of scientific inquiry. One of the most widely used models for ALD research is the chronic binge-eating mouse model, which is fed a Lieber-DeCarli diet. A Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5% ethanol was administered for 10 d to induce chronic liver injury [95, 96]. This model effectively replicates the primary features of ALD, including high blood alcohol levels, fatty liver, and liver damage, which can be observed as early as 9 h after ethanol administration [96]. The chronic binge ethanol feeding method, developed for this purpose, has been used in numerous studies to advance our understanding of alcoholic hepatitis models and the early stages of alcoholic liver injury.",
        "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases, with rapidly increasing global burden, as reported by the Global Burden of Disease data [97–100]. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is more severe form of MASLD, characterized by inflammation and fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis and HCC. MASLD and MASH have been previously referred to as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), respectively. These updated terms are now used to describe a spectrum of conditions associated with metabolic diseases, including fatty liver disease and hepatitis. Understanding the factors contributing to MASLD and MASH is complex because they are influenced by genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors [101]. To study these conditions, researchers have developed various experimental models, which can be classified: diet-induced models, genetic-induced models, chemical-induced models, and combination of models.",
        "First, the diet-induced models are widely utilized approach in the field of research, particularly in the context of studying chronic conditions such as obesity and metabolic diseases [102]. The Western diet (WD), which is characterized by high levels of saturated fats and simple carbohydrates, is used to induce obesity and metabolic diseases [103]. The WD model is particularly suitable for research on early fatty liver conditions, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, but it is not suitable for severe liver fibrosis or inflammation studies. Similarly, a trans-fatty acid diet (THD), which is rich in trans fats, has been associated with steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, making it a useful model for studying the transition from MASLD to MASH and insulin resistance-related liver dysfunction [104]. Other models, such as the methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) and fructose-denatured cholesterol (FDC) diet, have also been used to investigate obesity and metabolic diseases, with specific nutrient combinations serving as the focus of the study [105, 106]. The MCD model allows the observation of severe liver damage, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and fibrosis in the absence of obesity or insulin resistance [106, 107]. However, owing to low caloric intake and subsequent weight loss in the MCD mouse model, this model does not accurately replicate the full spectrum of metabolic dysfunction observed in MASLD [108]. The MCD model has been demonstrated to rapidly induce NASH and fibrosis, and it has been shown to elicit strong oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, rendering it a suitable model for studying the progression from NASH to HCC. In contrast, the high-fat diet (HFD) model produces a robust response in terms of weight gain, insulin resistance, increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis marker expression [109]. The FDC model is relevant for clinical studies because it closely resembles the pathology of human MASH caused by prolonged HFD administration. This model shows fat accumulation and abnormalities in liver metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis, making it a suitable platform for studying liver toxicity and metabolic diseases.",
        "In summary, WD and HFD models effectively induce fatty liver conditions without severe liver damage or fibrosis, making them suitable for studying obesity, metabolic disease, and MASLD [110, 111]. In contrast, THD, FDC, and MCD models are more appropriate for MASH and liver fibrosis studies as they rapidly induce liver damage through high fructose and modified cholesterol content [112, 113]. While numerous other models exist, this reciew focuses on the most commonly utilized ones. Diet-induced models offer advantages, including their abilityy to replicate pathological features observed in human lifestyles, their non-invasive nature, and their application in assessing hepatotoxicity in chronic liver diseases such as MASLD and metabolic disorders, as well as in long-term drug toxicity evaluation. However, these models require extended study duration and generally induce less severe liver damage and toxicity compared to alternative models.",
        "Genetic-induced models have been widely used to investigate the genetic basis of MASLD and MASH. A well-known example of a genetic model is the ob/ob mouse, which lacks the leptin hormone, thus leading to impaired regulation of food intake and increased energy consumption. The ob/ob model is characterized by severe obesity, insulin resistance, hyperphagia, and various metabolic diseases [114]. However, this disease rarely presents severe liver damage or steatohepatitis, indicating that additional factors such as diet and endotoxins are necessary to induce these conditions [115]. Similarly, db/db mice, which harbor a leptin receptor mutation, exhibit a phenotype similar to that observed in ob/ob mice, including obesity and metabolic dysfunction [116]. And, db/db mice model have more diabetes phenotype, but lack of steatosis phenotype than ob/ob mice [113]. Other models, SREBP1-c transgenic mice, develop steatosis, insulin resistance, inflammation and fibrosis, but without obesity. These models are useful for evaluating hepatotoxicity in studies related to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic disorders [117]. However, they are limited by their high cost, the low frequency of corresponding mutations in human MASLD/MASH, and the potential for off-target genetic effects unrelated to liver pathology.",
        "Chemical-induced models are primarily employed to study MASH, as they effectively induce fibrosis and inflammation. In chemical induction studies, excessive dosing is generally avoided, as the goal is to replicate chronic disease progression rather than acute liver injury. [118]. These models are frequently used in combination with diet-induced approaches to establish MASLD-associated HCC models. Among the commonly used chemicals, CCl4 induces direct hepatocyte damage, leading to fibrosis and HCC, but does not simulate the metabolic dysfunction seen in MASLD such as the absence of obesity and insulin resistance [119]. Another agent, streptozotocin (STZ), is utilized to induce diabetes mellitus [120], and when combined with diet-induced models, has been shown to accelerate MASH progression and liver fibrosis [121]. Although chemical-induced models allow for the rapid induction of fibrosis and hepatotoxicity, they do not fully replicate the chronic and multifactorial nature of MASLD/MASH, making them less suitable as standalone models for studying long-term hepatotoxicity.",
        "Also, combination of models is imperative to recapitulate MASLD and MASH models. Given the complexity of MASLD and MASH diseases and their manifestation in a variety of conditions, there is an ongoing development of models that integrate diet-induced, genetic-induced and chemical-induced factors [112, 117, 121]. The composite model has the capacity to represent the complex pathological mechanisms observed in human MASLD/MASH. In a recent paper, a low dose of STZ was administered to 7-weeks mice, followed by a HFD diet for 6–60 weeks. The progressive histological characterization and transcriptomic analysis of MASLD, MASH, fibrosis and HCC replicated the disease in humans. The model demonstrated that tirzepatide treatment ameliorated MASH, fibrosis, and HCC formation, suggesting its potential application not only for liver toxicity assessment but also for disease therapeutic intervention [121]. These models can be utilized for the study of hepatotoxicity according to various disease factors. Nevertheless, the experimental process is intricate and costly, and the number of variables can be substantial, which complicates the experimental control.",
        "A humanized liver animal model, which replicates human liver function by transplanting human liver cells into an animal liver, is a valuable tool for assessing hepatotoxicity [122]. This approach addresses the limitations arising from interspecies differences in the interpretation of hepatotoxicity results. To facilitate the engraftment of human liver cells, immunodeficient animals were used, and their intrinsic liver cells were removed to create a favorable environment for the transplanted cells to proliferate. The success of this model was validated by demonstrating that the resulting liver tissue was derived from human cells in the animal liver. Various humanized liver models have been used, with the homozygous urokinase plasminogen activator uPA (uPA+/+)-SCID and Fah−/−/Rag2−/−/Il2rg−/− (FRG) mouse models being the most commonly used for hepatotoxicity assessments [123, 124].",
        "In addition, TK-NOG mice are a type of NOG mice engineered to express herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (UL23 or HSVtk) specifically in the liver [125]. Upon ganciclovir administration, mouse hepatocytes are selectively eliminated, allowing for a high transplantation rate of human hepatocytes, which effectively replicate human liver characteristics. These models offer high flexibility in experimental design as it enables controlled hepatocyte damage while ensuring long-term survival due to the high transplantation efficiency. Notably, TK-NOG mice can maintain human liver metabolizing enzyme activity and bile excretion functions, making them a valuable model for drug toxicity evaluation. Among humanized liver models, FRG mice are particularly well-suited for chronic liver disease and drug metabolism studies [124, 126], while uPA-SCID mice are primarily used for acute hepatotoxicity evaluation and hepatitis virus research [127]. Additionally, TK-NOG mice provide a robust platform for studies focusing on human liver metabolism characteristics [125]. These models enable the generation of results that are highly relevant to humans, allow for the study of diverse forms of hepatotoxicity, and facilitate prolonged toxicity studies.",
        "Animal models are valuable research tools because of their ability to identify complex in vivo interactions, predict clinical outcomes based on physiological similarities to humans, and evaluate drug efficacy and toxicity. However, the interpretation of results from animal studies is limited by the differences in anatomy, physiology, and metabolism between humans and animals. For example, ibuprofen, a safe and effective antipyretic and analgesic in humans, is highly toxic to mice, illustrating interspecies discrepancies. In addition, ethical concerns surrounding animal testing persist, and recent advancements, including FDA approval for alternative methods such as organoid-based testing, suggest that technologies representing alternatives to animal models may gain prominence in the future. Furthermore, animal testing is both costly and time-consuming, which limits the size of the experimental groups. The stress experienced by animals during experiments can also affect study outcomes, further complicating data interpretation. Although animal models offer advantages in hepatotoxicity research, such as the ability to identify complex interactions in vivo, they also have significant drawbacks, including cost, time requirements, and ethical concerns (Table 2). Moreover, discrepancies between animal and human metabolic pathways can lead to differences in drug-induced hepatotoxicity. For example, drugs that do not exhibit hepatotoxicity in animal studies may induce hepatotoxicity in clinical trials. Therefore, reliance solely on animal models for hepatotoxicity assessment may be insufficient, highlighting the need for alternative methods [79].",
        "Long-term expansion is feasible with 3D models, offering the potential to overcome the many limitations of 2D culture methods. Unlike 2D models, which struggle to accurately replicate hepatocellular functions and metabolic capacity owing to a lack of cell-to-cell interactions and their inability to assess chronic toxicity, 3D models provide a more physiologically relevant alternative. Furthermore, as nearly 50% of the drugs that do not exhibit hepatotoxicity in animal models fail to predict human toxicity, both 2D cell and animal models have inherent limitations in replicating the complexity of human liver function. In contrast, 3D models accurately reflect the physiological characteristics and microenvironment of the liver in vivo. By better mimicking the complexity of liver tissue, 3D systems allow for a more precise evaluation of hepatocyte metabolism and drug reactions under conditions that closely resemble those found in the human body. This advancement holds promise for improving the accuracy of toxicity prediction and drug safety evaluation. The principal advantages of a 3D model are its capacity to reproduce an actual in vivo system, and its functional physiological characteristics with a high degree of fidelity. 3D models are primarily classified into two categories: spheroids and organoids. A spheroid is defined as a single-cell aggregate that is useful for short-term toxicity research or high-speed screening research, owing to its limited physiological similarity and difficulty in maintaining long-term characteristics. Organoids are formed through the differentiation of stem cells or tissue-derived cells by self-organization, and are composed of intricate multicellular structures. Organoids are valuable tools for long-term toxicity and regeneration research because they can reproduce complex functions in physiologically similar environments, including the liver microenvironment. Spheroids are inexpensive and can be easily manufactured, whereas organoids are more complex and expensive to produce, and there are difficulties in standardizing them. It is crucial to establish culture conditions and experimental models that align with the specific experimental objectives. This study examined the significance of the 3D liver model as a hepatotoxicity model, with a particular focus on the distinction between cell types and culture methods (Table 1).",
        "In addition to evaluating hepatotoxicity through the differentiation of PSCs into HLCs in 2D models, technological advances, such as 3D culture, have enabled the use of liver organoids for more mature and comprehensive hepatotoxicity assessments. The ability of liver organoids to replicate human liver function depends on the type of cells used and the protocols used during their development. A critical factor is how closely these organoids mimic the mature characteristics of the human liver, including drug metabolism, detoxification, albumin production, mitochondrial activity, regenerative capacity, and inflammatory responses.",
        "PSC-derived liver organoids, including those generated from iPSCs and ESCs, are highly versatile because of their pluripotency, which allows them to differentiate into various cell types and model a wide range of diseases. Son et al. successfully developed a liver organoid with self-renewal capabilities and mature liver function by using iPSCs and ESCs [128]. Organoid exhibits key liver characteristics, including albumin secretion, regenerative capacity, inflammatory responses, drug metabolism, and detoxification. Furthermore, they have been instrumental in identifying the clinical hepatotoxicity risks associated with trovafloxacin, a drug that was later withdrawn from the market, highlighting the potential of liver organoids for early hepatotoxicity prediction [128]. However, a limitation of this model is the low expression of CYPs, which are crucial for drug metabolism. Recent studies have modified culture conditions to enhance metabolic maturation and improve CYPs expression in liver organoids, thereby increasing their usefulness in predicting hepatotoxicity and assessing drug sensitivity [129]. The advantages of PSC-derived liver organoids include their ability to mimic mature liver function, model complex diseases, and provide a platform for drug testing and toxicity studies. However, challenges remain, such as achieving consistent CYPs expression, improving metabolic maturation, and reducing the variability between organoid batches. Despite these limitations, numerous studies have demonstrated the viability of organoids as powerful tools for hepatotoxicity research [130–132].",
        "The generation of liver organoids from primary cells derived from human liver tissue represents a promising and rapidly advancing research area. Unlike other cell lines and PSCs, primary human liver cells are inherently challenging to culture owing to their limited proliferative capacity and sensitivity to in vitro conditions. Advancements in organoid technology have overcome these challenges by enabling the generation of organoids from primary cells. Primary liver cells are typically categorized into two groups based on their source: healthy liver tissue and liver tissue-derived from cancerous lesions. Organoids derived from healthy tissues have the advantage of closely reflecting the physiological characteristics of normal liver functions, such as drug metabolism, detoxification, and regeneration. Conversely, organoids derived from cancerous liver tissues enable researchers to study disease-specific mechanisms, including tumor microenvironments and drug resistance pathways.",
        "PHHs are critical for studying drug metabolism. However, as previously discussed, 2D culture systems have inherent limitations, including a lack of in vitro proliferative capacity and inverse differentiation, which results in a rapid loss of liver-specific functions [132, 133]. To address these issues, adult human stem cells, including Lgr5 + cells, have been used to develop primary cell-derived liver organoids. These organoids primarily consist of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, which are classified as parenchymal cells. The process involved isolating the primary inverting cells and culturing them in a Matrigel suspension under optimized conditions. Various growth factors, including R-spondin-1, gastrin, EGF, FGF10, HGF, and A83-01, can be incorporated into the medium depending on the cell type and culture conditions [134–136]. In this study, organoids generated from human and fetal liver tissues exhibited functional similarities to PHHs. These similarities included albumin secretion, cytochrome P450 activity, expression of hepatocellular markers such as HNF4α, albumin protein expression, glycogen accumulation, and RNA sequencing profiles. Additionally, the study established conditions for the long-term culture of hepatocyte organoids. Fetal liver organoids have demonstrated robust construction and functionality, but organoids derived from adult PHHs are limited by their suboptimal efficiency [137]. Although this study did not conduct drug-induced toxicity tests, subsequent studies have used these organoids in hepatotoxicity studies [138, 139]. Furthermore, these organoids have been used as models for analyzing diseases, such as NAFLD, as well as for drug screening and toxicity assessments [137, 140].",
        "The use of human chemically derived hepatic progenitors (hCdHs) does not have the limitations of traditional hepatocyte models, because they facilitate the generation of hepatic progenitors from PHHs. This process involves treating cells with a combination of small molecules and growth factors to induce reverse differentiation into hepatic progenitors, which subsequently redifferentiated into hepatocytes. This approach allows for extended and sustained culture periods, thereby significantly enhancing their usefulness for research [141–145]. Kim et al. demonstrated the presence of mature hepatocytes in hCdH-derived organoids using hepatocyte markers, such as albumin secretion, glycogen accumulation, and CYPs activity. In addition, these organoids showed comparable or higher sensitivity than primary hepatocytes in drug-induced toxicity studies, highlighting their potential as effective models for hepatotoxicity research [146].",
        "Primary liver disease is becoming increasingly prevalent owing to the rising incidence of metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes. Early diagnosis of liver cancer remains a challenge, and despite advancements in medical technology, it continues to rank among cancers with the highest mortality rates. Organoids derived from primary liver cancer tissues, including HCC, cholangiocarcinoma (CC), and mixed tumor types, have been developed to better study this disease. These organoids were compared to their tissues of origin to assess their histological structure, protein expression using hepatocyte markers (HepPar1 and AFP), and gene expression using RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR. These analyses confirmed the similarity between organoids and original tissues. Broutier et al. demonstrated that both genuine liver tissues and organoids maintain genomic integrity over extended periods of culture. Moreover, the drug sensitivity of patient-derived primary liver cancer organoids was evaluated by exposing them to pharmacological agents [147]. Their study identified SCH772984, a previously unrecognized ERK inhibitor, as a potential novel therapeutic agent for liver cancer. Additionally, the findings highlight that each patient’s unique genome influences their susceptibility to drugs, underscoring the potential of personalized medicine in liver cancer treatment.",
        "An iPSC-derived organoid was developed to model steatohepatitis [148]. This was achieved by differentiating HSCs and Kupffer cells, which are liver-resident macrophages involved in steatohepatitis and fibrosis, from iPSCs in a 2D system and subsequently co-culturing them with an iPSC-derived liver organoid. Wolman disease, a condition characterized by significant lipid accumulation, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis, was used to assess the clinical applicability of this model. Using this model in the drug screening process, obeticholic acid (OCA) was identified as a potential therapeutic agent. OCA has been shown to reduce fat accumulation by promoting FGF19 synthesis, highlighting its potential for treating conditions associated with lipid metabolism and liver fibrosis.",
        "Organs-on-a-chip, also known as microfluidic devices, are continuously perfused micrometer-sized chambers designed to replicate the minimal functional units of tissues and organs [149, 150]. These devices recreate the complex microenvironment of biological tissues in vitro by microengineering various system parameters that are difficult to control using conventional models. They achieved this by generating physical and chemical gradients through fluid flow within the chip [151–155]. The liver-on-a-chip model incorporates a fluid flow system that facilitates dynamic culture, enabling the continuous delivery of nutrients and metabolites while mimicking cell-to-cell interactions [153, 154]. Numerous studies have shown that liver-on-a-chip technology holds significant promise for drug screening and hepatotoxicity evaluation. Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating organoid technology with organs-on-a-chip. For example, an iPSC-derived hepatocyte-like-cell organoid was used to develop a liver-on-a-chip in a 384-well format. This platform enables the prediction of hepatotoxic potential in DILI by analyzing drug processing. Hepatotoxicity was assessed by measuring the changes in albumin production, CYPs expression, ALT/AST release, and single-cell RNA sequencing following drug administration. This innovative approach provides a promising pathway for developing a robust DILI evaluation platform [156].",
        "3D models can be created using diverse engineering technologies, including bioreactors and 3D printing. Bioreactors are technologies that facilitate the cultivation of cells through the application of techniques such as mechanical stimulation, gradients in oxygen concentration, and the regulation of drugs or factors over time, thereby providing a realistic in vivo environment [157]. Although conventional methods are limited to observation in static cultures, the advent of bioreactors and microfluidic systems has enabled the creation of dynamic cultures that allow for the replication of microenvironments and control of conditions that more closely resemble those observed in vivo [158]. To evaluate toxicity, bioreactors must possess the requisite robustness to sustain cultured tissues for extended periods, maintain sterility, and support the fundamental metabolic processes of cells by providing an adequate supply of nutrients, cytokines, and gases for media flow, temperature, pH, drugs, glucose metabolism, and hepatic metabolic activity [157]. Various bioreactor studies have been conducted to assess drug toxicity. Recently, the 2D and 3D models described above have been used to create conditions that closely resemble the in vivo environment, thereby enhancing cell viability and efficiency. Using oxygen-controlled bioreactor and co-culture of mouse hepatocyte and NPCs, the viability and liver function of the cells were evaluated sufficient, and the toxicity of APAP was assessed through the administration of APAP [159]. These findings indicate that cells cultivated within the bioreactor exhibited characteristics and patterns analogous to those observed in vivo, mirroring the actual clinical toxic effects. 3D bioprinting is a prevalent technique in tissue engineering that facilitates the advancement of biocompatible materials such as hydrogels and the integration of 3D printing technology [160]. It uses a biomaterial comprising cells, designated Bioink, and uses various biocompatible materials, including ECM and hydrogels.",
        "Several studies have reported in silico models for evaluating hepatotoxicity [161, 162]. The quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) or quantitative structure–toxicity relationship (QSTR) model, a statistical-based system, has become prevalent in the field of computational toxicology. It is used to assess drug safety and investigate the hepatotoxicity of chemicals during the initial stages of drug development [163] (Table 2). Owing to enhanced comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of toxicity and the advent of numerous analytical instruments, the spectrum of in silico models and those capable of predicting hepatotoxicity are undergoing a phase of progressive evolution and advancement. In, a fused model of the mode of action (MOA) of a drug and a QSAR model based on Tox21 quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) assays were developed to predict DILI. The existing QSAR model exhibited an accuracy of 0.662, whereas the MOA-QSAR model demonstrated an enhanced accuracy of 0.711 [164]. Furthermore, the LiverTox database was developed to provide an accurate, efficient, and expedient method for evaluating the risk of liver toxicity associated with pharmaceutical agents before the initiation of drug therapy. Recently, a one-versus-all quantitative structure–toxicity relationship (OvA-QSTR) was devised, which employs publicly accessible databases and machine learning (ML) algorithms to categorize the risk profiles of pharmaceutical agents and predict the potential inherent hepatotoxicity of novel drug molecules [165]. The models demonstrated precision-recall domain values ranging from 0.718 to 0.869. These models exhibit predictive capabilities for hepatotoxicity at various risk levels. Additionally, models were developed to predict DILI using liver injury reports submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. This was performed to facilitate a comparative analysis of drugs associated with hepatotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms involved [166].",
        "A DILI prediction model based on AI and ML was developed. Recently, an AI/ML model comprising six ML methods was developed to predict severity has been developed. This model considers the physicochemical properties of drugs and off-target interactions between cells predicted in silico [167]. It has been suggested that an approach that combines different techniques can enhance the predictive capacity of DILI models that were previously based exclusively on chemical properties.",
        "In silico models have the capability to rapidly predict hepatotoxicity by leveraging extensive existing toxicity databases, including those from the FDA and LiverTox. This approach can significantly reduce the financial burden associated with animal and cell-based experiments. However, these models have limitations in accurately capturing the complexity of hepatotoxicity responses due to their inability to fully replicate the intricate metabolism of the human liver, including immune responses, microenvironmental changes, and interindividual variability. The quality and quantity of training data play a crucial role in the performance of AI-based models and computational prediction models, potentially leading to inaccurate predictions and limited reliability. Furthermore, these models face challenges in fully predicting the toxicity of active metabolites and assessing drug-drug interactions. Consequently, ongoing research aims to integrate in silico models for initial drug candidate screening with subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies to validate actual toxicity responses.Despite the numerous advantages of early screening, including cost-effectiveness, ethical concerns, and the ability to predict adverse outcomes,, the inherent limitations of these approaches, such as data bias, overfitting, and dependence on high-quality datasets, the lack of experimental validation, remain critical concerns (Table 2).",
        "This review examines hepatotoxicity assessment models in the order of their development and highlights numerous recent efforts to enhance their strengths and address their limitations. Following the implementation of the Food and Drug Administration’s Animal Testing Alternatives Act in 2022, there has been a significant increase in interest in in vitro and in silico models, driven by concerns over interspecies variability and ethical issues associated with traditional animal models. However, current models predominantly focus on acute hepatotoxicity, leaving a gap in chronic toxicity assessment. Given that many DILI develop over time, future research should focus on improving long-term toxicity prediction. Additionally, standardization and regulatory validation remain challenges for alternative models.",
        "2D models for liver toxicity assessment are widely used today, offering advantages such as ease of culture and cost-efficiency, particularly for high-throughput screening. Furthermore, because 2D models are cultured on flat surfaces, cell morphology and toxic responses to drug treatments can be readily observed, enabling quick and straightforward toxicity evaluations. However, hepatocytes exhibit a 3D structure and polarity in vivo that cannot be replicated in a 2D culture environment. This limitation results in a lack of representation of the physiological properties of the hepatocytes. Comprehensive toxicity assessments require the inclusion of interactions with NPCs that play critical roles in hepatotoxin metabolism. Although various studies, including co-culture experiments, have attempted to address this gap, the microenvironments and their complex physiological properties have not yet been fully reproduced. In addition, a significant limitation of 2D models is their inability to sustain long-term culture, which makes them unsuitable for evaluating chronic toxicity. The limitations of these 2D models could be addressed through advancements, such as the development of more physiologically relevant cell sources with enhanced proliferative and differentiation capacities and the establishment of multicellular analysis techniques using microfluidic chips.",
        "In the contemporary landscape of liver toxicity assessment, research has evolved toward integrating a diverse array of models, including in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methodologies. Future advancements in this field are expected to focus on reducing animal testing, enhancing personalized medicine, and improving physiological reproducibility. Several promising directions can be identified based on current challenges and emerging trends. First, the reliance on 2D hepatotoxicity models is expected to decline as 3D liver organoids and organs-on-a-chip provide more accurate the complex of liver microenvironments and cellular interactions. These models will not only refine liver disease modeling but also improve the precision of hepatotoxicity responses assessments. Additionally, patient-derived liver organoids could enable personalized drug toxicity evaluations, facilitating the development of individualized treatment strategies. Second, humanized liver models are anticipated to surpass existing methods in sophistication. Advances in gene editing technologies such as CRISPR will allow for the development of more physiologically relevant human-like liver models for evaluating the hepatotoxicity of novel compounds. Third, AI-based predictive models will be further standardized to enhance accurately early-stage toxicity assessments in drug development. A fusion model integrating AI-based predictive models with organoid-based systems could improve predictive accuracy while reducing the need for animal testing. Fourth, new hepatotoxicity assessment frameworks will reflect organ-to-organ interactions, particularly within the gut-liver axis, enabling more holistic evaluations of systemic drug effects. The adoption of multi-organ-on-a-chip platforms will likely increase, enabling real-time monitoring of drug interactions across multiple organ systems. Finally, multi-omics approaches, integrating genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data, will refine precise toxicity prediction, allowing for a deeper mechanistic understanding of drug-induced liver injury. Numerous recent studies have explored the integration of various models to improve hepatotoxicity assessment. For instance, it has been shown that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived HLCs, combined with bioreactors, can enhance differentiation and survival rates while providing an environment that mimics in vivo conditions [168]. One notable innovation is AI-based organoids, which represent the convergence of AI and organoid technology. The application of AI in organoid development has enabled the creation of more complex models that can better replicate organ functions and diseases. These advancements have enhanced their usefulness in assessing toxicological effects, evaluating pharmacological agents, diagnosing diseases, and advancing various research domains [169]. Convergence studies, including the development of toxicity-prediction algorithms, have facilitated precise and reliable toxicity assessments. In this review, we examined the advancements in toxicity assessment models to date and proposed future directions for developing more accurate and reliable models (Fig. 1). Given the rapid advancements in various fields of technology, we believe that integration of systems, such as AI-based organoids, patient-derived organoids, organoid-on-a-chip, and multi-organ-on-chip, will provide opportunities to enhance the assessment of hepatotoxicity for pharmaceutical drugs.Fig. 1Models for hepatotoxicity assessment. Liver toxicity assessment is evolving through the use of various models, including 2D in vitro models such as PHHs and in vivo animal models, which are actively used.

        "Cells navigate the environment differentially in response to evolving ambient stimuli 1. With this in mind, we as engineers, seek to predictably reprogram this ability of cells. This is accomplished by precisely constructing or finetuning cellular gene circuits 2, and of late, the cellular non-coding genome with the accrued knowledge of cis- (e.g., genomic enhancers 3) and trans-regulators (e.g., microRNA 4, 5 and transcription factors (TFs) 6), to rewire them to meet our end goals. The desire to induce stemness, or pluripotency, in this regard, has long been a dream for researchers. Toward this end, TFs have comprised the oft-trodden route for seeking such cellular transformations, specifically, from differentiated cellular states to progenitor or stem cell types. While the use of TFs has resulted in several success stories in the recent past, their limited precision in binding to specific DNA regulatory sequences, and the resultant unintended consequences of promiscuous binding to multiple such regulatory sites has been a stumbling block.",
        "In terms of successes in inducing stemness, the initial creation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), wherein a mature cell can be transformed into a pluripotent cell using a potpourri of carefully selected TFs, sparked off several use cases of such reprogrammed cells for diverse downstream applications. These range from cell-based therapies to disease modeling−from monogenic ones to complex, polygenic diseases, such as Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases 7, 8. Further, the ability to transdifferentiate cells pushed the boundaries of cellular reprogramming, by forcing cells to switch lineages, without explicit dedifferentiation 9. It is now known that the trans-differentiation events, triggered by transient exposure to pluripotency-associated factors, occur via a latent iPSC-like stage 10. Hereby, cells navigate two so-called valleys or steady-state “creodes” in the Waddington epigenetic landscape and the process itself is inherently inefficient. Such a landscape is represented by a series of branching valleys and ridges that depict stable cellular states and the barriers that exist between those states, respectively 11. It is coined after the proponent of epigenetics, Conrad Hal Waddington, who in 1942, described the molecular mechanisms by which the genotype modulates the cellular phenotype, recognizing for the first time that the epigenetic landscape has a causal mechanism of action on cell behavior.",
        "In this review, we will use the word “reprogramming” specifically in reference to the formation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from differentiated cell states, especially focusing on the iPSC technology. The virtual immortality of iPSC lines, coupled with their ability to preserve the pathophysiologic mechanistic features of the person they were derived from, makes them an attractive source of cells for disease modeling and personalized cell therapy.",
        "Biologists have long been able to edit genomes with a menagerie of molecular tools. The ability to modify the genome precisely is essential to dissect the mechanistic basis of diseases. Genome editing, which first surfaced in the late 1980s 12, with further refinements in mammalian cells in the 1990s 13, is synonymously used with the terms genome engineering or gene editing technologies. The early experiments demonstrated that an exogenously provided template could result in the integration of the new strand of DNA into the genome. These early experiments used classic homologous recombination and had lower off-targeting rates. However, the low efficiency of these classic methods has prodded researchers to design more efficient approaches.",
        "Initial use of TFs as reprogramming factors primed the field to look toward improving the precision and efficiency of the technology, with TFs giving way to zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector (TALE) nucleases, or TALENs. This in turn paved the way for the repurposing of the adaptive prokaryotic immune system, consisting of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), which house short invader-derived sequence strings and the CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein-coding genes 14, 15. This trajectory was motivated by the need to overcome the complicated design, cost, and size issues with the earlier versions of genome editing, such as meganucleases, ZFNs, and TALENs. For example, zinc fingers, which promised genome editing accurately and efficiently, cost US $5,000 or higher to order and were not widely adopted because of the difficulty to engineer them. Because CRISPR relies on an enzyme called Cas9 that uses a guide RNA (sgRNA) for targeting and then editing the nucleotide, scientists often need to order only the RNA fragment. The other components can be bought off the shelf with a total cost of as little as $30. This is what essentially paved the way forward for CRISPR as a disruptor technology and democratized the field of genome editing. This is akin to the way next-generation benchtop sequencers got us closer to the thousand-dollar genome. The Cas9 nuclease in Type II CRISPR-Cas systems 16 can cleave target DNA (or RNA) at specific sites, via double-stranded breaks (DSBs), which can then be repaired using DNA repair mechanisms, such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) 17 or homology-directed repair (HDR), the latter being the traditional approach of yore 12.",
        "Interestingly, CRISPR/Cas9 systems are foreign to the eukaryotic genome and were adapted from prokaryotic immune systems 18. The CRISPR array consists of multiple copies of a short repeat sequence, typically 25 to 40 nucleotides, separated by similar-sized variable sequences that are derived from viral or plasmid invaders. CRISPR loci are present in nearly all archaeal genomes that have been sequenced thus far and roughly half the bacterial genomes and serve as genomic memory from invading pathogens that the organism chooses to retain. These loci are transcribed and then processed to form mature target-specific CRISPR RNA (crRNA) effector complexes, which in collaboration with the scaffold-like, trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA) bind to the Cas9 endonuclease, enabling the correct conformation of the Cas9 endonuclease for cleavage to occur downstream. Thus, Cas genes are strictly found in CRISPR-containing prokaryotic genomes, and mostly, in operons in close proximity to the CRISPR loci. In their native format, CRISPRs and Cas genes function toward protecting the prokaryotic genomes from the continual onslaught of invaders. In particular, exposure of CRISPR-Cas possessing microbes to invaders results in the addition of new invader-derived sequences at the leader-proximal end of CRISPR loci in the microbial genomes. The ultimate products of the CRISPR loci are small RNAs, around 42 nucleotides in length. In the type II system, in particular, the Cas9 protein recognizes the crRNA, which then Watson-Crick base-pairs with the sequence adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), and also to the 80-nucleotide tracrRNA 19. Biosynthetically, a single 102-nucleotide sgRNA, constructed as a crRNA and tracrRNA chimera was shown to enhance cleavage, in contrast to the original two-component RNA system 20, 21. On the surface then, the CRISPR-Cas system is reminiscent of the RNA-interference (RNA-i) pathway, which has been used primarily to repress gene function, without the complete ablation of the gene. However, RNA-i piggybacks on microRNA (miRNA) and other endogenous small RNA processing pathways, including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs).",
        "RNA-i is a naturally occurring post-transcriptional gene regulatory process that is used in diverse organisms to modulate gene expression. It hinges on the use of endogenous small non-coding RNA pathways. In the native process, miRNAs are expressed from the genome as long, double-stranded primary miRNAs. These then undergo nuclear processing by the proteins Drosha and Pasha/DGCR8 (Microprocessor complex subunit), to form a stem looped pre-miRNA, which is then exported to the cytoplasm. Next, further processing by another enzyme, Dicer, generates the mature miRNA. In contrast, small interfering RNA (siRNAs) are typically exogenous in mammalian cells, often introduced by infecting viral particles. Double-stranded viral RNA is cleaved by the same pre-miRNA-processing enzyme, Dicer, to form short siRNA fragments. Thus, both siRNAs and miRNAs share similar machinery downstream of their initial processing steps. Using these interfering RNA molecules as its mediator, RNA-i carved out a niche for itself in the early 2000s. However, the technology was replete with major obstacles, with a major one being the lack of targeting precision. Furthermore, the target, for the most part, is the protein-coding genome.",
        "The imprecision in miRNA targeting stems from the rather relaxed requirement for sequence complementarity, for example, between the miRNA's 5' end and the corresponding mRNA's 3' untranslated region (UTR). This scenario in living systems would solicit the advantage of being able to use the same regulatory RNA strings for diverse targets in order to regulate gene expression. In contrast, in a therapeutic setting, such non-canonical, or so-called seedless interactions, defined as regulatory RNA-mRNA interactions not requiring miRNA seed-based complementarity result in harder-to-predict interactions, and consequently, imprecise targeting protocols. These would then call for sophisticated predictive algorithms to rectify, as used in our recent work 4.",
        "Motivated by the trajectory of maturation of some of these related technologies, this review first summarizes the initial successes of cellular reprogramming, wherein cells can be efficiently reprogrammed from various initial cell types (Figure 1). Next, we highlight the differences between RNA-i and genome editing technologies, focusing on CRISPR-Cas9, in relation to fostering novel cell engineering approaches. We also discuss the lessons learned from the development trajectory of RNA-i technology and how this information can whet the transition of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to the clinic. We present some of the technical roadblocks presented in a field where CRISPR has democratized genome editing technologies. Finally, we discuss how the precision and delivery of genome editing technologies, specifically that of CRISPR-Cas9, can be improved to enable bench-to-bedside translation.",
        "Pluripotency, an evanescent attribute of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), is first encountered in the inner cell mass (ICM) of pre-implantation blastocysts and is gradually superseded by the overt differentiation of the cells into diverse somatic lineages. PSCs can give rise to all somatic lineages, that is, cells that could have arisen from all three embryonic layers, including ectoderm (e.g., neurons), mesoderm (e.g., blood or muscle), or endoderm (e.g., pancreas), and possibly, even primordial germ cells, but not an extra-embryonic trophoblast lineage. Experimental chimeras are widely recognized as the gold standard for assessing pluripotency. In vivo, pluripotency is a transient state, however, ex vivo, pluripotent cells can be derived from early embryos and can be maintained indefinitely via an optimized microenvironment of exogenous cues. Thus, pluripotency is not an irreversible feature intrinsically resident in cells, but is a transient feature in evolving cells, at different stages of pre- and post-implantation. Overall, the goal in the creation of PSCs ex vivo is to reduce the genomic or epigenomic “distance” between embryonic stem cells (ESCs), conceivably, the PSC gold standard, and synthetically derived PSCs. In addition, a reliable, essentially inexhaustible supply of quality-controlled PSCs, both for disease modeling and regenerative medicine, is required.",
        "PSCs, which include ESCs, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)-ESCs, and iPSCs, have the combined property of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple lineages; although, this clinically appealing self-renewal property needs to be preserved via the right stimuli. This is primarily achieved by promoting the expression of ESC-specific genes and suppressing differentiation-related genes 22. ESCs are obtained from the inner cell mass (ICM) of discarded in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos1 in their blastocyst stage 23. In fact, by culturing an ICM of blastocysts, mouse ES cells were first generated in 1981, proliferating infinitely, while maintaining pluripotency 24, 25. The unexpected finding that somatic cells can revert all the way back to the embryonic state using a carefully selected menagerie of TFs led to the chemical manipulation of signaling pathways to reprogram cells 26 and even to trans-differentiation events, such as transdifferentiating pancreatic exocrine cells to β-cells 27 and other transformations 9, 28.",
        "Another induction mechanism, the SCNT induction of pluripotency, was first demonstrated in sheep with the birth of Megan and Morag in 1995, followed with the birth of Dolly, the sheep 29. In this mechanism, the careful removal of the nucleus of an egg cell results in an enucleated oocyte. This is followed by replacement with a somatic cell's nucleus, at which point the egg's cytoplasmic, meiosis factors enable the formation of a fertilized egg nucleus 30, 31. The altered somatic cell is then allowed to develop to the blastocyst stage and SCNT-ESCs are obtained from its ICM. Interestingly, while the SCNT process has demonstrated that epigenetic, rather than genetic, alterations underlie most differentiation processes during cellular development, cell fusion experiments (where somatic cells have been fused with pluripotent cells) have demonstrated that the pluripotent state is dominant over the somatic state in the context of cell hybrids 32. Together, these observations led to the evolution of the iPSC technology, circumventing the limited supply of human oocytes, necessary for both ESCs and SCNT-ESCs. iPSCs are generated using the retroviral mediated insertion of the TF cocktail: Oct-4 (octamer binding protein 4) also known as POU5F1 (POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1), SOX2, KLF4 (Krüppel-like factor 4), and MYC (collectively, OSKM) 33-35. This cocktail was determined to be sufficient to establish a de novo pluripotency program, producing embryoid2 bodies in vitro and teratomas in vivo, and formation of diverse tissues in chimeric embryos in mouse blastocysts, and with more refinement of the protocols, complete mice upon injection into tetraploid mice blastocysts 36. The selected TFs in the generation of these iPSCs are essentially transcriptional regulators, which were found to be active in ESCs. OSKM, or its variants, have been found to be sufficient to convert mature cells into iPSCs, affording a magnifying glass into the mechanisms driving this remarkable cellular fate change and a powerful means to model cell development in a dish. This is important because iPSCs represented a game changer in the ability to model the development processes that a defective stem cell (e.g., clinical-grade iPSC line acquired from a patient) would undergo, potentially revealing all the mechanistic transformations that can occur in the development of the pathological manifestations of the specific genotype. This could then supplement, and potentially replace in part, experiments with mice and other model organisms, typically carried out in exclusion of human cell-based experiments. This is because human stem-cell based models, recapitulating specific diseases, were simply not available. In this context, while mouse experiments have been the de facto standard for drug testing and mechanistic assays, interestingly, even for ESCs derived from mouse versus human, there are distinct differences in signaling processes manifested by the two cell types. Thinking at a coarser granularity, the number of times a mouse heart beats per minute is 600, while the human heart is roughly one-tenth of that number! It has been shown that the mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), derived from the pluripotent epiblast tissue of early post-implantation mouse embryos and possibly the in vitro counterparts of anterior primitive-streak cells, are temporally distinct from mouse ESCs and may serve as the missing link between mouse and human embryos 37.",
        "The hypothesis that the “stemness” property of a living cell is reversible was first validated via a series of seminal experiments performed by Sir John Gurdon in 1962 38. Other classic studies then followed, including those conducted on cells from Drosophila melanogaster, in which the “transdetermination” phenomenon was observed. Specifically, it was shown that cells from the fruit fly's genital structures could give rise to leg or head structures, and eventually, to wings 39. In 2006 and 2007, Takahashi and Yamanaka made landmark contributions to the field by creating mouse and human iPSCs, respectively, with the introduction of several reprogramming factors, specifically the OSKM cocktail 33, 34. Since the publication of this groundbreaking work, other TF cocktails, consisting of factors such as OCT4, Nanog, SOX2, and LIN28 (ONSL), and of OSK, have been reported 40. By altering the composition and stoichiometry of the iPSC-generating cocktail, among other input factors, the efficiency of the iPSC-generation process and the quality of the iPSCs can be controlled effectively. Attempts have also been made to computationally finetune this process by using a recently developed network-biology platform, CellNet, to assess the gene-regulatory networks produced by different TFs 41. The revolutionary discoveries that initialized the generation of these iPSCs won John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2012. With this discovery, and others 42, came the ability to surmount the ethical controversies encircling the use of ESCs, notwithstanding that ESCs are derived from the ICM of blastocysts. Although, technical challenges exist in the use of ESCs. For example, ESCs from an allogeneic source can result in HLA (human leukocyte antigen)-based immune rejection, limiting their utility for cell-replacement therapies. The ability to generate patient-specific iPSCs alleviates this immunogenicity problem, effectively removing a significant barrier in the translation of cell-based therapies to the clinic. Another, less easy issue to address with ESCs, is their tumorigenicity 43, which can be thought to be intricately tied to the very hallmarks of pluripotency.",
        "Since the initial generation of iPSCs in 2006, many research groups have created iPSC lines, extending to different cell types and emanating from different patient pools, including from other species, and identifying new TF combinations that increase the efficiency of iPSC production (see 35 for a recent review). Further, the most common source of human iPSCs is dermal fibroblasts 44, stemming from their ease of access and programmability efficiency, with peripheral blood 45, cord blood 46, and Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B-cell lines also emerging as practically attractive sources, with the latter affording the opportunity to acquire iPSC donors from biobanks 47. The most technically rewarding feature of iPSCs is that they can recapitulate the pathophysiologic background of the patient from which they are derived, for example, ordinary skin cells can be derived from a patient and then converted to iPSCs for further processing. This results in the potential to create personalized disease models to recapitulate distinct human disease phenotypes, and then, to be able to perform gene corrections (e.g., genome editing), and to personalize therapeutic screenings. This feature is also shared by SCNT-ESCs, albeit, constrained by the limited supply of embryos for research use. Notwithstanding, the SCNT technique is now back as the alternate PSC-generating technology on the block, given its more recent accomplishments in primate and human SCNT systems, stymied in the past by the arrested growth of SCNT-derived embryos 31. This resurgence of SCNT-ESCs was also fueled by findings related to the presence of hotspots of aberrant epigenetic programming, such as regions around telomeres or centromeres or aberrant imprinting at specific gene clusters (e.g., Dlk1-Dio3 cluster 40). Such aberrations may result in greater molecular differences between iPSCs and ESCs than desirable for clinical applications. Furthermore, not all PSCs are alike 37, they could be naïve or they could be primed, for example 48, and in their naïve state they are closer to ESCs (for a recent review, see 49), and therefore, possibly more beneficial from a translation standpoint. Thought-provokingly though, there could be a dark side to this naïve pluripotency. Rat embryonic stem cells (ES cells), expanded in cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-containing feeders, tend to acquire genetic abnormalities. This could potentially arise from the increased activity of endogenous retroviral elements or jumping genes 50, or, the reduced activity of repressive methylating marks, which is what confers the naïve pluripotency in the first place 51. This, in fact, points to the possibility that with the appropriate use of predictive technologies, coupled with laboratory validation, iPSCs could be made more similar to SCNT-ESCs. Thus, SCNT-ESCs can be viewed as a complementary technology, rather than as a competing technology, wherein differences in the epigenomic profiles of SCNT-ESCs and iPSCs could be minimized using the right combination of TFs, supplementing or supplanting parts of the original OSKM cocktail, as the need may be with other TFs or miRNAs or small chemical compounds. In addition, while initially SCNT-ESCs were considered a panacea for patients with mitochondrial disorders, recent studies have shown that mitochondrial-mismatched stem cells when reintroduced into the cells from which the donor nuclei were obtained can cause mitochondria-related antigenicity 52. Notwithstanding these technical caveats, this increased availability of disease-reminiscent cells from actual patients has a transformative potential in disease modeling, informing both drug discovery and cell-therapy advances, and there are pros and cons of both technologies that can be harnessed to improve the state of the art. Further, the combination of high-throughput karyotyping assays alongside algorithmic tuning can hone the potential of these derived pluripotent cells. In this context, unlike the more elusive differentiation recipes for ESCs and the still-emerging advances in SCNT-ESCs, the iPSC technology has already attained significant maturity, is elegant in its simplicity, and may also afford greater reproducibility in differentiating into various target phenotypes. Thus, iPSCs have been used to develop “disease-in-a-dish” models for benchmarking various proposed therapies, in a patient-specific and disease-specific manner and can benefit from an alliance with the slew of maturing genome editing technologies, such as variants of the CRISPR-Cas components 53, 54. Furthermore, newer versions of the endonucleases, such as CasX and CasY, both of which are smaller than the conventional type will, in effect, possibly make the recent CRISPR-related patent litigations over CRISPR-Cas technology moot. Moving forward, we first discuss the translational challenges of the iPSC technology and the evolution of the CRISPR-based genome editing technologies, to understand the burgeoning potential of such an alliance, some of which is just beginning to be unearthed with the march toward precision medicine, and with it, the ensuing flourish of novel computing infrastructures and technologies, such as those engineered by our group 55, 56.",
        "A relatively recent success story from such an alliance is the NHEJ-mediated correction of iPSCs derived from dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB) 57, a rare, dominant negative, blistering skin disorder, with no current cure. Given that CRISPR genome editing technologies are at the brink of new and improved clinical trials, especially in the realm of cell-based technologies 8, we will focus this review on featuring the advances in CRISPR-based genome editing technologies.",
        "Designer nucleases have energized advances in genomic medicine by enabling the targeted manipulation of specific genomic sequences. Their basic strategy is essentially the same. It involves directing a DSB in the desired genomic locus in an RNA-guided fashion, followed by post-scission repair mechanisms. As described earlier, this could be via the error-prone, albeit predominant mechanism, NHEJ, or, the less frequent, HDR pathway. The CRISPR technology, the latest of several customizable genome-editing approaches, is a more flexible gene editing platform, with the most commonly used form being the SpCas9 nuclease, acquired from Streptococcus pyogenes. Cas9 molecules from other species, Cas9-like CRISPR nucleases and engineered versions of Cas9 with novel functions have also been established and can convey particular advantages in diverse settings, as described in a recent review 54.",
        "The origins of the CRISPR-related research can be traced back to 1987 when Nakata and colleagues discovered a set of interspaced short repeat sequences, in proximity to the Escherichia coli iap (Inhibitor of Apoptosis) gene, which is responsible for the isozyme conversion of alkaline phosphatase 58. As a programmable form of bacterial immunity molecular machinery, with the first experimental evidence of the existence of these type II CRISPR-Cas systems in 2007 15, repurposing for use in mammalian cells was pioneered around the same time, in 2013, by two groups 21, 59. This class of nucleases differs from the three other major classes of nucleases: meganucleases, ZFNs, and TALE nucleases (or TALENs), primarily in that the CRISPR-Cas system does not require extensive protein engineering and can be tailored simply by altering the guide RNAs (sgRNAs). ZFNs and TALENs are chimeric enzymes, consisting of a DNA-binding sequence fused to a sequence-agnostic FokI DNA-cleaving nuclease domain. This FokI enzyme, naturally found in Flavobacterium okeanokoites, is a restriction endonuclease that must dimerize for DNA cleavage to occur 60. ZFNs have proven difficult for non-specialists to synthesize from scratch because of the challenge in assembling zinc finger domains that can bind to a string of nucleotides. Attempts by the Zinc Finger Consortium (http://zincfingers.org/) have enabled efforts at improving the technology while bounding the costs associated with the technology. So, while re-targeting of these ZFNs and meganucleases requires elaborate protein engineering and TALENs require complex molecular cloning, the use of in vitro transcribed nuclear localization signals (sgRNAs) that can be made to target any 20-bp nucleotide sequence, makes the CRISPR-based systems essentially cloning-free 61. Further, unlike the FokI enzyme that operates as a dimer in ZFNs and TALENs, the Cas9 endonuclease acts as a monomer to induce the DSB in the target nucleotide. Also, the Cas9 gene is small compared to a pair of TALEN genes, roughly 4.1 kbp versus 6 kbp, making delivery simpler. Finally, due to the small size of the CRISPR guide RNA, it is possible to multiplex gene targeting, simultaneously affect multiple genetic loci 21, 62, and potentially dissect the mechanisms of a swath of complex, polygenic diseases in their native contexts, such as via saturation mutagenesis 63.",
        "In more advanced living organisms, such as humans, pathogens are detected by antibodies and cells, such as B- and T-lymphocytes. In lower living organisms, such as in bacteria, other creative processes fight the constant onslaught of predators. Predation by mobile genetic elements, such as phages, plasmids, and transposons, on bacteria, is ubiquitous. This has promoted the deployment of creative defense systems, including CRISPR-Cas arrays, in bacteria and other prokaryotes to fight predation. Now, the type II CRISPR-Cas systems have been adapted to enable efficient genome editing in a wide range of cultured cells and organisms, with its most widely used form consisting of the Cas9 enzyme and a single guide RNA (sgRNA, which is ~20 nucleotides in length) that mimics the natural hybrid of the crRNA and the tracrRNA. Target recognition by the Cas9-sgRNA complex requires Watson-Crick base pairing with the sgRNA's 5' end as well as a short PAM sequence, located immediate downstream of the target DNA sequence and varying in sequence features among CRISPR-Cas orthologs found in different bacterial species. Further, the Cas9 nuclease contains two conserved HNH and RuvC endonuclease domains, which when inactivated (via point mutations), results in the dCas9 enzyme variant, with removal of one of the domains creating a Cas9 nickase. The dCas9 nuclease-deficient variant retains the full DNA binding activity, albeit, losing the DNA cleaving activity.",
        "The CRISPR-Cas system, as a second-line-of-defense, confers adaptive immunity to the bacteria, presenting a heritable and chronologically-captured account of past invasions, without sacrificing fitness.",
        "The CRISPR-attack mechanism can be summarized in three execution steps, where the first stage can be likened to an “information-processing subsystem” and the second and third stages can be grouped into an “executive subsystem.”",
        "This stage involves the genetic memory and recognition of alien DNA by dedicated Cas proteins, followed by processing and integration into the CRISPR locus (Figure 5). This stage can be subdivided into two steps: the selection of a protospacer−short piece of DNA typically around 30 bp in length homologous to viral or plasmid DNA−followed by the generation of spacer material and the integration into the CRISPR array with the synthesis of new flanking repeat sequences. The short (3 or 4 bp) PAMs located immediately downstream of the protospacer appear to determine the protospacer selection, followed by integration into a pre-existing CRISPR array. The alien DNA is processed into small spacer elements by assistive Cas proteins and encoded into the CRISPR-Cas system. The elements are subsequently inserted into the CRISPR locus toward its leader sequence, which may, in some cases, necessitate the destruction of some obsolete spacers in the array in order to bound the size of the CRISPR array. Therefore, a chronological record of the integration of the spacer sequences reflects the hierarchy of previous encounters with mobile genetic elements (bacterial pathogens). The CRISPR array evolves by deleting redundant or obsolete spacers. Each of these new spacer sequences matches some section of the infecting phage genome, referred to as a protospacer. Although the location of the protospacer sequence in the pathogen's genome is random, it is always just a few base pairs from the short PAM that is recognized by the CRISPR system. This latter step is a way for discriminating “non-self” from “self” genetic material, thus making the system self-protecting.",
        "CRISPR expression is the transcription of the precursor CRISPR-RNA, pre-crRNA (longer transcripts) that are sequentially processed to small crRNAs that actually do the work. This step is catalyzed by endoribonucleases encoded by the Cas genes that may either operate as a subunit of a larger complex, as in the Cascade complex in E. coli\n64, or may operate as a stand-alone enzyme as in Cas6 in the archaeon P. furiosus\n65. These crRNAs act as guide RNAs for different interference modules that target and cleave genetic material after annealing to the complementary protospacer sequence of the invading (pathogenic) element.",
        "To correctly position the CRISPR attack, CRISPR interference involves the potential degradation of the target nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) by the CRISPR nuclease that recognizes the pathogen's DNA (target DNA sequence) and the corresponding PAM. The cleavage by the ribonucleoprotein complex, consisting of the crRNA guide RNA and a set of Cas proteins, occurs at or in the vicinity of the PAM sequence. Interestingly, while bacteria have devised mechanisms to ward off infection, viruses can sometimes deceive the CRISPR-Cas system of the host by randomly mutating key bases in the CRISPR-RNA interaction or PAM recognition step. As an example, the integration of a virus protospacer into the host DNA can actually spur the pathogen's invasion, such as in the case of the cholera virus, tricking the CRISPR-Cas system into actually enabling the viral infection 66.",
        "When deciphering the above CRISPR-Cas mechanisms, researchers noticed that the guide RNA in the system, which recognizes the viral nucleotide, can be engineered to recognize any target nucleotide, not just viral nucleotides, guiding the nuclease to snip the specific target, at which point the mutant gene can be replaced with a healthy copy. This is the basis of the use of CRISPR-Cas in eukaryotic systems, all of which can be done in cultured cells and fertilized eggs, allowing for the generation of transgenic animals with genes knocked out.",
        "While the CRISPR-Cas system presents promising approaches to the evolution of genomic medicine, there is increasing concern that changes introduced by genome editing can be heritable, making off-target effects more alarming.",
        "Off-target effects of these systems in the bacterial and archaeal worlds, from where these were derived, may in fact be a beneficial mechanism. Specifically, off-targeting can help these prokaryotic organisms recognize and cleave hypervariable DNA from predators, optimizing immune surveillance using some optimization function, e.g., genetic algorithms. However, when repurposed in eukaryotic systems, these same defensive mechanisms undermine specificity 19, 67 and reduce cellular fitness 68. Attempts are being made to improve the specificity of CRISPR-Cas systems through both biochemical methods 21 and computational algorithms 69. In particular, Cas9 targeting is modulated by the 5' variable region of the sgRNA, which hybridizes to the complementary protospacer motif 70. While scoring models have been developed based off experimental binding data 71, genome-wide unique sgRNA sites have also been identified 72. While in the S. pyogenes Cas9 variant, the PAM sequence is an “NGG”, tools for coming up with optimal protospacer designs are also available, based off the criteria of on-target editing efficiency and off-targeting at undesired genomic locations 71, 72. Thus, the presence of off-target effects and possible genome editing-derived oncogenicity indicates that the technology is still in a fledgling state, as indicated by the observation that the CRISPR/Cas9 technology used to modify the hemoglobin B locus in human zygotes was at a highly inefficient frequency 73. In this context, it may be mentioned that the number of off-target events that can be tolerated is application-dependent. When the off-target effects are introduced by a Cas9 endonuclease versus when using dCas9, the latter may be less deleterious. This is because dCas9 typically affects the transcriptional properties of the genome without introducing permanent (heritable) changes. Finally, sgRNAs themselves may vary in specificity, from being highly specific to being the poster child of a “promiscuous” sgRNA. Thus, modified sgRNAs may be required, as illustrated by the sgRNA for VEGF-A, whose off-target effects were studied using Digenome-seq 74, which can detect indels with a frequency as low as 0.1% and lower. Indels can also be identified using Guide-seq (genome-wide DSB detection), where barcoded DNA pieces are inserted, followed by high-throughput sequencing 75. Also, translocation events can be determined by Guide-seq and high-throughput, genome-wide, translocation sequencing (HTGTS) 76. This, notwithstanding the fact that the mining of glorious volumes of these NGS datasets, which are both varied and on the rise, is expensive. Complicating this scenario further is the fact that there could be cell-type specific DSB hotspots and even unique DSB hotspots in the same cell type from different individuals. For the former, cell-type specific empirical validation is called for, and, for the latter, recombination initiation, high-resolution, individual-specific maps are useful.",
        "Finally, the premise for genome editing of human somatic cells is that corrective changes to a sufficient number of defective cells could offer a once-and-done therapy for the patients. However, while increasing the dose of the nuclease may increase the probability of the mutated gene being corrected, it comes at the cost of simultaneously increasing the risk of cuts being made elsewhere in the genome, especially when contemplating in vivo applications. Thus, it is safer to start with the application of genome-editing technologies on somatic cells, rather than in human germline cells, as is recently becoming a more visible application, albeit, with limited success 77.",
        "The CRISPR technology has been advancing rapidly, and since 2013, there have been multiple reports of successful repurposing of the CRISPR technology for human gene editing 20, 21, 61, 67, 78. Given the ubiquitous use of murine models for researching human disease phenotypes and the known genomic and physiologic differences between mice and men, iPSCs, which are normal primary cell lines, bring forth a radically new way of understanding human disease mechanisms. In particular, human iPSCs offer an unprecedented means to perform both disease modeling and personalized cell replacement therapy. Such applications have received a further boost, fostered by the alliance of iPSC technology with genome editing and with the refinement of the genome editing protocol, initially reported to be roughly 1-2% in human iPSCs3\n21. What started off in human cells with the introduction of the Cas9 expression vector and the crRNA and tracrRNA ensemble was further simplified by combining the two RNAs into one chimeric RNA 61.",
        "Notably, while immortalized human tumor cell lines have been edited with very high efficiency 79, the success rates in human iPSCs have been much lower 59, 80, which may presumably be the resilience to DNA damage in tumor cell lines. Thus, efforts have been made to maximize the efficiency of genome editing in iPSC cell lines 81. These design considerations start from the very choice of the iPSC cell lines. For example, low passage number iPSCs would have low karyotypic abnormalities. However, these cell lines may also retain greater degrees of similarity to the differentiated cell type from which the iPSC may have been derived. There may be a sweet spot here that can be algorithmically determined, for example. Next, the plasmid donor vectors need to be carefully selected and it has been found that polymorphic differences between the plasmid vectors and genomic loci will decrease targeting efficiencies 82. Also, somewhat intuitively, insertion vectors are preferred over deletion vectors 83. Finally, once the genome of the iPSC cell line has been edited, validation of the editing efficiency is needed and some guidelines from past efforts at characterization can be employed 84, such as pluripotency tests, karyotype analysis, gene expression profiling and epigenetic analysis.",
        "In terms of PSCs, iPSCs have come under fire from researchers, calling for a rigorous evaluation of the safety profile of stem cells before banking on iPSCs, quite literally 85, for use in downstream applications. Even from the standpoint of iPSC creation, reliance on viral vectors as the most efficient means of delivering reprogramming factors risks insertional mutagenesis, which could also affect downstream differentiation 86. In addition, random integration of these foreign viral elements into the iPSC genome can create distinct iPSC lines, which is not desirable. While alternate approaches are being researched 87, 88, including the first reports of reprogramming using non-integrating vectors 89, 90, the creation process will need to be streamlined, patient recruitment protocols need to be established 91, and possibly more convenient sources of cells need to be identified (e.g., cryo-preserved blood samples 92), prior to industrializing the process for clinical translation.",
        "Furthermore, recent reports have debated as to whether SCNT-ESCs may afford a better source of derived-ESCs 30. This is important because SCNT-derived ESCs have been thought to be very similar to conventional ESCs, as determined by tetraploid complementation assay (TCA), the most stringent test of pluripotency, compounded by the recent exome-sequencing findings that have indicated significantly lower mutational load in SCNT ESCs relative to iPSCs of syngeneic background 93. Further, a bottleneck here has been the ability to reduce the variability between created iPSC lines. Such differences are mostly caused by differences in the genetic backgrounds of the cell types, and more so, on the reprogramming protocol that the cell lines have undergone because the effects of varying genetic backgrounds can be abrogated via prolonged culture 94. Here, the ability to genome-edit otherwise isogenic cell lines to ensure that control and diseased cell lines have the same genetic background is beneficial. This presence of isogenic cell lines is crucial for low-effect loci discovered through the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) because, in such cases, as is often encountered for complex, polygenic diseases, the difference between the normal and diseased phenotypes may be subtler, and that too, attributable to multiple genomic loci. Thus, such isogenic pairs of disease-specific and control iPSC cell lines, such as in creative clinical trials-in-a-dish formats 21, would enable the cost-effective translation of iPSC-based technologies, even in the context of harder-to-model, complex diseases, with multiple low-effect disease loci.",
        "Another requirement for the clinical adoption of iPSCs is the use of non-integrating approaches to generate iPSCs, which in fact have been demonstrated to have different reprogramming efficiencies, success rates, and genomic integrities 95. Further, yet another, and harder-to-surmount challenge, is the contested similarity of iPSCs to ESCs in their gene expression profiles 96, epigenetic lineage memories 97, and proteomic profiles 98. This propels the controversy surrounding the use of iPSCs as ESC surrogates in the first place. In this context, spatio-temporal control of reprogramming factors released using various biomaterial-based strategies may afford a novel and more versatile channel of delivering reprogramming factors or small molecules for generating iPSCs 99 (Figure 2). In addition, mechanistic explorations 21, abetted by bioinformatics tools 41, can also help maintain the genomic stability of an otherwise physiologically unstable process of cellular reprogramming. Finally, in the past iPSCs were considered mostly for monogenic diseases. However, given the surge of genome editing-based technologies, genome editing can enable the use of iPSCs toward the cure of polygenic, complex diseases, which result from the presence of multiple mutations in the genome, as opposed to a single mutation 100. In this context, it may be appreciated that the ability to source iPSCs from the diseased cell mass in a patient will also preserve tumor heterogeneity, which has been increasingly studied boosted by the surge in single-cell omics technologies 101. This is important because such clinical extracts afford a realistic window into diverse populations of diseased cellular ensembles.",
        "One of the primary challenges of the iPSC technology is the epigenomic variation of the derived iPSC cells 102 and this is one of the areas where the dCas9 mutant, in conjunction with epigenetic modifiers 103, can facilitate quality control of the generated iPSCs. Further, gene activation using the same dCas9, albeit, in activator mode, can be used to control differentiation regimens of the iPSCs 104. While, in theory, iPSCs can result in a slew of differentiated cell types, such as neurons, hepatocytes, or cardiomyocytes 105, 106, a lot of these processes are still inefficient, produce heterogeneous cell populations, and need optimization for high efficiency, reproducibility, and scaling up.",
        "Classic genetic screens, whether forward or backward screens, ascribe functionality to the different genes. While forward genetics identifies genes responsible for a specific trait or phenotype, reverse genetics analyzes the phenotype of an organism following the disruption of a known gene. It is hard to simultaneously gauge the effects of the 22,000 or so genes in the human genome and this is where the advantages of high-throughput screening using CRISPR comes to the fore. While RNA-i has played a prominent role in high-throughput screens in the past, incomplete knockdown, ability to target only coding regions 107, and off-targeting have dampened the results. In comparison, CRISPR can create frameshift mutations in the coding regions, using NHEJ 108, or even mutate non-coding regions 109, genome-wide 110. This is important, given the surge of findings showing the importance of the non-coding regions as disease drivers; see the recent review on the influence of non-coding variants in cancer for a summary of some of these revelations 111. Importantly, in the case of editing non-coding genomic elements, functional knockouts with a single sgRNA is not practical, with exceptions 112. Instead, two sgRNA have been used to precipitate simultaneous breaks flanking the target region, resulting in a well-defined genomic deletion 113 and scalable tools for designing these paired sgRNAs are also on the horizon 114. Thus, CRISPR screens have been used for identifying non-coding cis-regulatory elements, such as in 103. Furthermore, CRISPR-mediated screens can be both loss-of-function or gain-of-function screens, depending on the type of domain that is fused to the denatured Cas9 enzyme 115. Finally, the ability of CRISPR-based screens to interrogate gene regulatory networks 116 is a useful tool for validating bioinformatics-based mapping of such networks.",
        "While genome editing has the power to study complex diseases and even remove the scourge of organ shortages by bringing Margaret Atwood's pigoons4 from the novel “Oryx and Crake” to life, it is important to move with caution to avoid enthusiasm in genome editing from biasing the necessary scientific exploitations and explorations needed to sound out the technology. For one, it may be better to term these so-called human-pig chimeras, “genome-edited pigs”, rather than “pigoons” to avoid the cynicism associated with the creation of animal chimeras, in general. Consider this, raising genome-edited pigs for acquiring organ transplants, rather than having to wait for donated organs from fatally injured young humans, such as those killed in road accidents. Every day, about 22 people in the United States die waiting for an organ transplant (https://www.organdonor.gov/statistics-stories/statistics.html). In the arena of inter-specific chimeras, a team, led by Izpisua Belmonte of Salk Institute for Biological Studies, began by combining genome editing with stem cell biology, two revolutionary platform technologies 117, and using the pig as an “animal incubator”. A similar experiment was first carried out in 2010, when Japanese scientists produced a mouse from rat PSCs, so inter-specific chimeras, contributing to xenogeneic development 118. Such experiments, motivated by the fact that it is challenging to regenerate entire organs (for organ replacement needs) in vitro, have not steered clear of controversy. Notwithstanding, these experiments are promising because interactions between cells and tissues is critical for organogenesis and creating the complex microenvironment in vitro for actual transplantation purposes is daunting. This, is different from the need to generate synthetic microenvironments for mechanistic revelations, where simplified environments may actually be desirable when teasing out the individual mechanistic factors, rather than being on the lookout for holistic revelations about the entire niche. Importantly, the 2010 experiments used Pdx1-/- mice for the studies to knock out the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox1 TF essential for pancreatic development and β cell maturation, and thus, created an open pancreatic developmental niche for accepting the donor cells. Of note here is that homozygous deletion of Pdx1 in mice results in death due to pancreatic insufficiency. These rat-mice pairings were followed by demonstrations of organ-specific pairings in other interspecies chimera, in close succession 119, 120, essentially indicating that developing an organ of a certain species inside the body of a different species is possible if the correct microenvironment is established. Belmonte's group took these experiments a step forward by using CRISPR editing to turn off the mouse gene that makes the pancreas 117. Then, rat PSCs containing the intact pancreas gene were inserted into the surrogate mice, resulting in the mice “incubating” rat (xenogeneic) pancreases.",
        "Using genome editing, one can create either indel mutations at the break site using NHEJ or introduce “knockin” alterations using HDR. NHEJ is error-prone and introduces SNPs or small insertions or deletions (indels). These indels cause frameshift mutations, resulting in functional gene knock-outs 121. In comparison, HDR inserts a desired sequence, combining a target locus with an exogenously supplied genomic fragment at one or multiple locations of the genome 21. Further, while NHEJ is active throughout the entire cell cycle, and therefore easier to exploit, HDR faces competition from NHEJ, being active primarily during the S/G2 phase. This competition is worrisome because in the context of gene editing to treat sickle cell anemia, for example, the repair of the DSB by NHEJ, as opposed to HDR, could result in an allele similar to that seen in β-thalassemia, requiring suppression of NHEJ, or enhancement of HDR-like mechanisms 122.",
        "While the wild-type Cas9 introduces a DSB via its two nuclease domains, namely, RuvC and HNH domains, Cas9 nickases with a point mutation in one of the two domains only cleave a single DNA strand. Alternately, these nickases can be paired such that a pair of offset sgRNAs, complementary to opposite DNA strands are nicked 123, and then, these nicked sites are repaired by the high-fidelity base excision repair mechanism (BER); BER reactions in cells are extremely fast, with an individual BER event often occurring in a matter of minutes 59. Notably, most nicks result in very low indel rates resulting in effective targeted gene disruption 124, 125. Now, if instead of mutating one of the nuclease domains, both domains are mutated, the result is a dCas9 without any nuclease activity. The dCas9 is created via two point mutations in both its RuvC-like (D10A) and HNH nuclease (H840A) domains, and this mutant Cas9 is devoid of endonuclease activity. However, this dCas9-sgRNA complex can terminate transcription elongation, as confirmed by native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) experiments. In this case, the binding of the sgRNA to the promoter region can sterically prevent the association between integral cis-acting DNA motifs and their cognate trans-acting TFs, switching off transcription initiation. In this mechanism, commonly termed CRISPR-i, and in many ways analogous to RNA-i, repression efficiency can be modulated by the number of mismatches in the sgRNA base-pairing region 110, 126. Furthermore, using a complementary mechanism (CRISPR-a), effector domains to activate the transcription of target genes can be employed 127.",
        "RNA-i is a conserved endogenous pathway that affords the sequence-specific silencing of the defective gene by knockdown of the target mRNA. However, as described before, its utility has been hampered by incomplete gene knockdown, extensive off-target effects, requirement of host-cell factors, and experiment-to-experiment variability, making downstream phenotype prediction challenging. On the other hand, the CRISPR-Cas system, combines the permanent mutagenicity of conventional mutagens with the relatively simple RNA-i programmability. Further, whereas RNA-i is not useful for diseases in which the complete ablation of gene expression is essential, the CRISPR technology can completely knock out genes, without leaving behind “scar” sequences. Alternately, it is also able to function in an RNA-i-reminiscent manner when deploying a catalytically dead, or, nuclease-deficient, hence non-cleaving, Cas9 mutant, dCas9, from catalytically deadCas9 128, resulting in CRISPR-interference or CRISPR-i. Thus, in addition to Cas9-based total loss-of-function, CRISPR-i and CRISPR-a can facilitate partial loss or gain of function 127.",
        "The safe and effective delivery of these RNA-i molecules is another issue 129. With lessons from the delivery issues encountered in the development of RNA-based therapeutics 130, scientists can use the CRISPR technology to directly manipulate any gene in diverse cell types and organisms with enhanced precision and completeness. In this context, it may be noted that, in the case of CRISPR, the delivery of these nucleases may either be carried out on their own or with so-called donor DNA. The latter process resulting in new genetic information being added through the surrogate HDR substrata. Further, alternate forms of programmable enzymes can also be complexed to the DNA-binding domain, when using dCas9 variants, resulting in site-specific recombinases 131 and transposases 132. If desired, CRISPR-technology variants can also cleave RNA, instead of DNA, thus resulting in non-heritable changes 65, adding to the versatility of the technology.",
        "RNA-i and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies share similarities, with both methods utilizing small RNAs with high desirable levels of on-target specificity 14, 59. However, their molecular mechanisms are intriguingly different, as outlined in Table 1. RNA-i operates by honing in on the endogenous miRNA-processing pathway, using near-perfect complementarity with the target mRNA 133. In fact, depending on the degree of sequence identity between the miRNA and its target, the nature of the regulatory effect can be different. For example, limited complementarity can result in mRNA deadenylation or decay, while extensive complementarity can result in slicing, meaning complete cleavage. Further, seedless miRNA interactions account for upwards of 90% interactions, as gleaned from cross-linked immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) data. Driven by this, we have developed machine learning (ML) algorithms, specifically kernel support vector machine (SVM) models, to predict these accurately and in a computationally efficient manner 4. Similar technologies are on the rise to predict the off-target bindings of CRISPR and other adaptive nucleases 69.",
        "Genome editing operates by using site-specific endonucleases to drive desired genetic alterations, whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or, whole gene addition or removal, again with a high degree of precision. Among the prevalent genome-editing technologies, the type II CRISPR system from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9), targets a 20-nucleotide DNA sequence, immediately followed by a 5'-NGG-3' PAM, generating a blunt-ended DSB. This system was touted as the simplest to program and use. However, recent studies have found that SpCas9 may be less specific in action in comparison to a Cas9 ortholog from another species, S. aureus (SaCas9), as assessed by BLESS (direct in situ breaks labeling, enrichment on streptavidin and next-generation sequencing) 100. The molecular machinery of the CRISPR-Cas9 bacterial adaptive immunity can be repurposed to alter (in the dCas9 variant form) or abrogate the transcription of any gene, be it in eukaryotic or in prokaryotic systems. The use of genome editing in prokaryotes affords an unprecedented advance in engineering synthetic biological systems.",
        "At its simplest, the CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of the chimeric single guide RNA (sgRNA), consisting of the combination of CRISPR-associated RNA (crRNA) and partially complementary trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA). The crRNA has a variable guide sequence that directs the Cas9 endonuclease action in a sequence-directed manner. Cas9 is directed to DNA sequences complementary to the protospacer, and then Cas9 creates a double-stranded break (DSB) at the genomic locus to be modified, which triggers cellular DNA repair by one of two methods. In the first, this DSB is repaired by the imprecise NHEJ pathway, the predominant DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells, creating frameshift mutations, disrupting the reading frame of a coding sequence or the binding sites of trans-acting factors (e.g., TFs) on DNA sequences that act as cis-regulatory elements (e.g., enhancers or promoters). Such mutations either intentionally knockout a gene, facilitating reverse genetics and assignment of gene function, or correct a disrupted reading frame. This mode is typically useful when a loss-of-function event is desired. In the second, more precise HDR pathway 134, there is a simple deletion of the targeted sequence, and then, this deleted sequence is filled up by any desired exogenous sequence (Figure 3). This repair template contains homologous sequences to the regions flanking the DSB, resulting in scarless DNA insertion, including the addition of whole genes. The latter process, HDR, is however the less preferred route selected by the cellular machinery. Therefore, in order to coax the cell toward selecting the HDR pathway over NHEJ, various innovative approaches have been developed, such as the use of small molecule activators of the HDR pathway 135. Alternately, the higher chance of the cell using its NHEJ machinery has also been put to advantage by the simultaneous use of two Cas nucleases, excising the intervening sequence, as has been recently used for the removal of a premature STOP codon in Duchene muscular dystrophy 136.",
        "Stemming from the similarities of these two technologies, the promises and roadblocks in the evolution of RNA-i have informed the development of the CRISPR technology 14, 137 [Table 1]. As an example, near-perfect complementarity was assumed to be required for RNA-i processes to work. However, now it is known that non-canonical RNA-i interactions may be the primary driver of off-target interactions 138. Recently, great strides have been made in solving this problem by using predictive algorithms to learn from high-throughput sequencing data (e.g., CLIP-seq), while taking the widespread, non-canonical regulatory RNA-mRNA interactions into account 4. While in the RNA-i world, this occurrence of non-canonical interactions was discovered with the maturation of the technology, bioinformatics algorithms have been at the forefront of this realization from the outset of CRISPR technology 69, 74. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can allow for multiple mismatches between the sgRNA and cognate nucleotide sequence, modulated by the quantity, position, and base identity of the mismatch, resulting in off-target effects 21, 59, 139. Furthermore, crRNAs have been demonstrated to vary widely in their efficiency, with variable indel rates of 5 to 65% 21. Thus, efforts are being made to refine the precision of the technology and to design safeguards to reduce off-target lesions 74, increasing the specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 systems. Such unwanted mutations are especially disruptive for applications where high precision levels are desired, such as in creating isogenic cell lines for testing causal sequence variants 140 or in clinical applications. Figure 4 summarizes some of the factors that need to be taken into account while designing a more specific CRISPR-Cas9 system 141.",
        "Consider patients with genetic mutations that make them vulnerable to a cardiomyopathic phenotype. This phenotype is manifested by weakened heart muscles and a proclivity to heart failure. As an example, there could be a mutation in the phospholamban (PLN) gene, which is an important regulator of calcium cycling and critical to cardiac health 142. Skin cells from such a patient can be isolated and then converted to iPSCs via cellular reprogramming. Next, these iPSCs can be differentiated into cardiomyocytes (iCMs, meaning induced cardiomyocytes), which then carry the genetic history of the patient with the specific cardiomyopathy phenotype. Then, targeted genome editing nucleases can convert the faulty iCMs into healed iCMs, which can subsequently be transplanted back into the patient. This is exactly what was done in a recent study 143 where the cells from a patient with a hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy associated with a PLN R14del mutation were edited to restore a wild-type phenotype. In this way, targeted genome editing offers the ability to isolate the patient's diseased cells and exogenously correct their phenotype. Corrected autologous cells could then potentially be re-introduced into the patient's body to ameliorate or even cure the condition.",
        "This process sounds attractive and the progress, in recent years, bodes well 144, especially in adoptive cell therapies, where T-cells are harvested from the patient, modified ex vivo, expanded, and then reinfused into the patient 145. Realistically, however, reprogramming the patient's cells, differentiating them, correcting them, and reintroducing the corrected cells into the patient's body is a tall order in which all the parts of the pipeline need to be juxtaposed in a fail-safe, perfectly elegant manner. In today's clinic, introducing cells-as-drugs 74, 146, in order to coax the faulty cells to rewire in their native niche, post transplantation, is gaining traction, especially in the realm of cancer immunotherapy 147. In this capacity, the living cells, or even artificially-synthesized cells 148, or cell-derived systems 149, would act as information processing modules, programmed to carry out the dictated tasks. Examples would be living cells that could achieve programmed cell death in the host 150 or those that are armed with combinatorial sensing circuits for multi-input autonomous decision making 151. Regardless, the marriage of genome editing and iPSCs, if successful, holds the promise to alter the face of medicine. As a proof-of-principle experiment, non-genome-edited iPSCs have, for the first time, been used in a patient for treating age-related macular degeneration 152, which alongside the use of genome-edited iPSCs in cell-based models 153, promises an exciting path forward for genome-edited iPSCs.",
        "As applications of genome editing extend into sensitive areas, such as stem cell therapeutics, it is critical to thoroughly examine whether this approach causes unwanted genetic changes through the rigorous assessment of the genome-editing efficiency in terms of both on-target events (e.g., scission or epigenome editing) and off-target lesions, potentially resulting in cytotoxicity. One of the earliest examples of CRISPR applications in stem cell research was in the functional repair of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor receptor (CFTR) in intestinal stem cell organoids of cystic fibrosis patients 153, affording a proof-of-concept for genome editing by HDR in patients with a single-gene hereditary defect 153, followed by many other studies involving blood and neuromuscular disorders, as summarized in a recent review 154. However, before translation to the clinic, the following are some of the most pressing issues to be resolved.",
        "While initial attempts have been made to minimize mutational load 155, 156, the effects of unanticipated off-target lesions introduced by genome editing is unclear. Most studies investigated off-target effects of this approach in cultured human transformed or immortalized cells, such as in 293T and K562 cells 21, 157. In cancer cell lines, Cas9-gRNAs caused higher-than-expected levels of off-target mutagenesis 21, raising concerns regarding the application of genome targeting for therapeutic purposes. More recent genotyping studies examined the off-target effects of genome-editing methods (CRISPR-Cas9, TALENs, and ZFNs) in the entire genome of human iPSCs 158 or PSCs 157 by using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Although these recent WGS studies suggested that the genome-editing approach exhibited low levels of sequence changes in iPSCs and other PSCs, these modified clones are not 100% isogenic compared to their parental cell lines. This is because they seem to have acquired other genetic variations during clonal expansion. Furthermore, due to the limitations of current next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based WGS methodology, the entire genome-wide analysis of off-target mutations induced by genome editing remains unresolved. Conventional NGS methods are not able to detect low-frequency off-target mutations due to their high background error frequency (0.1%) 159. Sequencing artifacts make it difficult to discern nuclease editing-induced alterations. In addition, bioinformatics filtration can eliminate some genuine mutations. Unlike conventional sequencing technologies that sequence only a single strand of DNA, Duplex Sequencing sequences both strands of DNA and scores mutations only if they are present in both strands of the same DNA molecule as complementary substitutions. This approach significantly reduces the background error frequency (5x10˗8 to 10˗8) 159 and thereby accurately identifies the low-frequency off-target mutations. An unbiased and genome-wide method that accurately detects even ultra-low frequency off-target mutations would be required to define the changes induced by genome editing. In addition, it is not easy to interpret many sub-chromosomal changes, copy number variations, or point mutations that are not clearly associated with genetic abnormalities of known diseases. High-throughput functional genomic analyses would be necessary to examine the effects of new genetic lesions induced by genome editing on the growth, differentiation, tumorigenicity, or functionality of stem cells. On the bright side, however, given the low frequency of off-targeting at any given locus, a prudent study design with multiple wild-type clones compared to multiple targeted clones of interest, would mitigate genetic heterogeneity concerns. This is because it is unlikely that multiple targeted clones will have the same off-target lesion. Further, software programs aimed at the rational design of sgRNAs in CRISPR-Cas9 systems (e.g., 69) can help determine the levels of on-target and off-target cleavages. It is worth noting that even with the same genomic sequence, different steric contexts 160, or varied genomic contexts, such as different epigenetic modifications at the genomic loci, can alter the effects of the nuclease (Figure 4), and such factors can be built into the software's input feature space. In fact, the catalytically deactivated Cas9 (dCas9 from dead-Cas9) can be fused with various effector domains, e.g., epigenetic modifiers 32 to specifically alter the on-target activity of the nuclease, as in 161 (Figure 3D). This kind of fusion extends the scope of CRISPR way beyond loss-of-function experiments 115. For example, when fused with epigenetic modifiers, dCas9 can act as a transcriptional repressor 115 or as a transcriptional activator 67, 125, transcriptional activation facilitating CRISPR's use in gain-of-function experiments. Also, dCas9 can facilitate programmable chromatin 162 and RNA 163 pulldown. Finally, in a recent bid toward improving the methods to directly visualize genomics loci in the 3D nucleus, the nuclease-deficient dCas9 variant was used as a probe to label sequence-specific genomic loci fluorescently without globally denaturing DNA 164. One such method, CASFISH 165, which is Cas9-mediated fluorescence in situ hybridization, is a rapid cost-effective method. It does not require heat and formamide treatment to globally denature DNA as generic DNA FISH technologies do.",
        "The successful delivery of the guide RNAs and nuclease (Cas9) is essential for efficient genome editing. In this context, genome editing can be thought of as an easier task, given that unlike RNA-i, genome-editing therapeutics do not necessitate sustained transgene expression, increasing the portfolio of delivery agents. However, the selection of the delivery agent also depends on the desired method of DNA repair after the DSB. While for NHEJ, only the endonuclease needs to be delivered, for HDR, the donor DNA needs to be co-delivered for a sustained period of time, with adenoviral vectors demonstrating high accuracy as HDR donors, albeit, with low efficiency 166. Furthermore, unlike RNA-i, which piggybacks on endogenous RNA-based pathways, delivery of CRISPR-Cas9-based therapeutics requires the delivery of the Cas9 gene or protein, which can be quite bulky. Traditionally, small-molecule synthetic drugs are below 500 kDa in weight while bulkier antibodies that can be successfully delivered do not require intracellular delivery. A solution here is to use gene therapy vectors to express both the endonuclease domain and the sgRNA domain. Here, while constitutive transgene expression is an advantage, increasing the potential for on-target cleavage, extended persistence of these nuclease components may result in higher off-target mutations, presenting somewhat of a double-edged sword.",
        "Conventional delivery agents include both viral and non-viral delivery approaches. On the viral side, the usual vehicles can be used, including lentiviruses (e.g., integrase-defective lentiviruses 167), adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses (AAV) 168. While AAV-based viral vectors and electroporation have been widely used in preclinical animal models in vivo, as listed here 169, with promising results in hemophilia 170, muscular dystrophies 171, and other hereditary diseases, the use of AAV-based systems can bear the risk of residual nuclease expression and integration of the viral vectors into the host genome, although not observed in preclinical studies. With this mind, non-viral modalities, including, cell-penetrating peptides, lipid nanoparticles, semiconductor quantum dots 172, or cationic lipids 173 can be used, with electroporation and rapid mechanical deformation being more recent forms of delivery. However, electroporation, which involves pulsed electric fields, can permanently disrupt cell membrane integrity, especially in cells of the blood and immune system 174. So, rapid mechanical deformation with microfluidic devices appears to be safer and more precise, at the single-cell level, delivering a higher throughput and the ability to transfect hard-to-transfect cells, such as human ESCs or iPSCs, relative to immortalized tumor cell lines 175.",
        "A critical need in biology is to identify the sets of genes underlying specific biological processes. The feasibility of large-scale, loss-of-function screens in mammalian cells is very useful from this standpoint, wherein the DNA-level inactivation of genes and the ability to edit non-coding parts of the genome would be informative. Such DNA-level, genome-wide screens are beyond the scope of RNA-i, even when combined with NGS technologies. An end result like this necessitates the efficient cleavage of both copies of targeted loci by single copies of high-scoring, highly effective sgRNA. This is in contrast to the high concentrations of sgRNA required for transfection-based experiments 176. When extended to clinical applications, off-target lesions, especially in cancer cell lines 32, and oncogene activation are some of the concerns of genome editing that need to be addressed before promoting the more mainstream use of this technology in medicine. In genome editing, the sgRNAs need to be designed to be precise and powerful such that the desired gene locus can be effectively repaired, as in the case of the gene Tafazzin (TAZ), which was shown to be a necessary and sufficient mutation for Barth syndrome-related cardiomyopathy 177.",
        "The iPSC technology by itself can recapitulate morphological and functional phenotypes of various diseases. As an example, from the standpoint of tissue regeneration, the optimal differentiation of PSCs to the target cell type of interest is critical. To this end, there are established differentiation protocols, such as those that were demonstrated to result in clinical-scale production (>1 billion cells/batch) of cardiomyocytes (CMs) from human ESCs, e.g., in 178. Here, the differentiated CMs were shown to display sound structural and functional properties in an infarcted primate heart, demonstrating the promise of remuscularizing a human heart. However, when such technologies, are deployed in combination with genome editing and extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimicking technologies 7, the mechanistic insights gleaned from such experiments will shine further. This is because genome editing will result in appropriate isogenic controls for the test cases.",
        "The extraordinary tour de force of genome editing in cellular engineering can be unleashed by deploying robust study designs in concert with combinatorial modeling algorithms. At the most basic mechanistic level, this could involve using genome editing to both insert a disease-causing mutation in wild-type cell lines (e.g., using HDR) and to correct disease-causing mutations in patient-specific iPSC cell lines (e.g., using NHEJ), testing both the sufficiency and necessity of the mutation, respectively. Further, by introducing disease mutations in iPSC lines with different genetic backgrounds, the extent of the lethality of the mutation can also be tested. Finally, the ability of genome editing to transcend the boundaries of cell-based models can be probed by incorporating iPSCs into chimeric animal models 165, offering an ability to interrogate the effect of the mutation in a whole-animal model. In addition, model systems, such as stem cell organoids and microfluidic systems, with ECM-mimicking scaffolds armed with a combinatorial library of input variables, offer a way to precisely and predictively control the cellular microenvironment, approximating whole-body responses.",
        "How are different cell types so unique, collaborating in life processes by virtue of their exquisite specializations, in spite of their identical genomes? These cellular specializations may be attributed to the “epigenome”, with cell type-specific gene-expression levels being modulated by it. With the human genome project demonstrating the feasibility and initial success of large-scale sequencing projects toward solving the overflowing trove of puzzles deciphering human health and diseases, the scientific community started mapping cellular epigenomes and annotating them using sophisticated machine learning techniques 136. The epigenome, which includes DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, can regulate chromatin accessibility (to chromatin modifiers), and thus, the expression of genes. In fact, the cellular epigenome is a reversible and heritable “layer” of regulation. With the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project being a trailblazer in the epigenetics community 179, pioneering many of the technologies to identify regulatory elements in the human genome, modENCODE further added to the repository of experiments. modENCODE houses datasets of the epigenomes of model organisms 180, which are mostly easier to experiment with, and hence, useful for validating and finetuning initial computational predictions. Abetted by this increasing awareness of the importance of the epigenome, the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) (http://www.ihec-epigenomes.org/) was started in 2010. With a vision to map epigenomes, and more specifically, to generate 1,000 reference epigenomes, using both primary tissues and cell lines (ENCODE uses cell lines), IHEC now has nine organizations under its umbrella, including ENCODE (USA) and BLUEPRINT (European Union), the latter having chosen to focus on the blood system 181, given the faster-route-to-market of blood products in general.",
        "Alongside this surge of epigenomic datasets, and perhaps, motivated by the axiom: “Correlation does not imply Causation” (whereby it is seen that while current studies can infer functionality for epigenomic marks via correlation, it is a challenge to determine which marks contribute to which functions), there has been a need for the targeted manipulation of epigenomic features. To this end, uses of small-molecule inhibitors (e.g., DNA methyltransferase or histone deacetylase inhibitors 182) and nucleases have been underway. In terms of small-molecule inhibitors, desirable properties include rapidly reversible and dose-dependent effects; the ability to conduct phenotypic screening of small-molecule libraries 183, resulting in flexibility of design; and their relative ease of handling and with more established delivery protocols. However, the in vivo targets of these chemical inhibitors are often multitudinous, and this, naturally, can lead to multifaceted side effects, in vivo. Thus, comes the excitement encircling the ability of CRISPR-Cas, and other designer nuclease systems, to edit the epigenome, such as, in the form of the targeted perturbation of histone modifications 161. Further, simultaneous interrogation is often important given the structure of the human genome. The eukaryotic genome is highly compact and has a functionally responsive three-dimensional (3D) structure, as is becoming more and more evident with the sophistication of chromosome-conformation capture techniques, as typified by chromosome conformation capture (3C) and derivative (4C, 5C, Hi-C) methods. 3C methods, with their variants 184, afford us an unprecedented insight into looping three-dimensional epigenomic landscapes, such as the loops that initiate enhancer-promoter contact, and to topologically interacting domains. In this developing view of the topologically folded genome, the local chromatin architecture is segmented into distinct modules called physical domains or topologically associated domains (TADs) using CTCF-binding sites, which function as insulators between TADs, with the regions demarcated by TADs often times containing coordinately regulated genes. Now, these TADs contain hundreds, or even thousands, of candidate marks and interrogating them simultaneously is the next frontier to be conquered.",
        "In addition, epigenome editing can be thought of as being at the forefront of synthetic biology, enabling an engineering framework toward using chromatin logic, and having seen an initial entrance to the clinical scene, mostly in the form of small-molecule, chromatin modifiers 185. Epigenome editing basically involves altering the chromatin state, and ensuing gene expression, without bringing about changes in the genomic sequence, which can essentially unravel the regulatory sophistication of the chromatin. So, while for genome editing, there are gene-silencing or activating factors, fused to the targeting module; in epigenome editing, the targeting module is fused to chromatin-modifying modules, such as, DNA methyltranferases, or demethylases, and histone acetyltransferases (HATs, e.g., p300), or deacetylases (HDACs), to name a few. Such editing, in conjunction with powerful ML algorithms to map out the very presence of these genomic regulatory elements, such as in 136, will go a long way in teasing out the mechanistic basis of diseases. Further, is it possible to consider epigenome editing as a tool to efface the dark side of induced pluripotency−the latter, in the form of aberrant epigenomic programming? Can some of the epigenetic variations, stemming from the induction of pluripotency, be undermined by CRISPR endonucleases, such as, some of the new tools on the horizon, unearthed by the marvels of metagenomics and technological discovery engines 186? This would, of course, again, be dependent on the on-target specificity of the genome editing processes and on the ability to tease out the epigenetic signatures in such reprogrammed cells, forestalling undesirable cancer-ridden trajectories.",
        "Finally, it is worth mentioning here that 93% of GWAS hits, both disease- and phenotype-associated hits, are found in the non-coding genome 187. Thus, naturally occurring mutations that confer resistance to different diseases have been found in these non-coding regions. Many such non-coding mutations involve loss-of-function alleles, which can be catalyzed using NHEJ-based frameshift mutations, when genome editing. Given the high efficiency of NHEJ-based gene editing, this strategy has been in the works for the treatment of HIV 188. However, as in the case of more traditional antiviral therapies, the nature of these lentiviral infections, whereby the virus, such as the HIV virus, invading T cells and integrating into the T-cell genome, for example, makes it a challenge to eliminate the latent viral genome from the host cells 189. In principle, T-cells could be programmed to generate the nuclease, when invaded by the HIV genome, but genome editing the T-cells has been a challenge. For one, while the NHEJ-based mutations ideally result in inactivating the HIV genome, in some cases, the indel may not inactivate the virus, and in fact, prime the virus for enhanced survival and that is enough to make the treatment go awry. However, the ability of the Cas9 nuclease to excise latent viruses from the host cell's genome is a big fillip for the use of these technologies for HIV-related pathologies because in HIV large reservoirs of latent provirus often persist after the end of the antiviral regimen and these could reactivate the infection once the treatment ceases 81. Further, and more relevant to our article here, is the combined use of iPSCs and CRISPR toward being able to confer resistance to HIV. It is known that individuals homozygous for the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) gene with 32-basepair deletions (labeled CCR5-delta32, a deletion mutation of the gene) are immune to HIV-1 infection and only 1% of the total population has two copies of this gene with relatively high frequencies in Europe. Further, around 20% of the population carry only one copy of the mutation, and although, they can still contract HIV, its progress is greatly impeded. Thus, CCR5 disruption in iPSCs is a feasible route for developing HIV resistance 190. In the past, however, incomplete protection from HIV-1 using shRNA-mediated knockdown and the concomitant potential for mutagenesis from the integrated viral vectors required for constitutive shRNA expression 191, concerns about the fitness of the transduced cells 188, and the off-target damage 192 have sullied the initial enthusiasm and these need to be resolved prior to further translation. In this regard, the potentially permanent mutation of the gene by CRISPR-Cas9 editing and the lower chance of off-targeting, especially in relation to zinc finger nucleases, may be somewhat of a panacea.",
        "The envisioned ability of two rapidly evolving technologies−creation and maintenance of pluripotency (e.g., iPSC technology) and genome editing (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 technology)−to alter the face of disease on earth is breathtaking, albeit, with some unresolved scientific quandaries. Technologies for reading the genome (NGS technologies), writing the genome (synthesizing millions of basepairs), and high-precision editing of the genome, and of the epigenome, have all developed at a frenetic pace over the last decade. Indeed, these fast-evolving technologies complement each other to enhance current strides in today's genomic medicine era. For example, the fast pace of development of genome editing technologies−a dream in the world of medicine since the recognition of genes as units of heredity−holds the promise of eradicating congenital diseases, modeling the effects of non-coding genomic variants, and slowing the onslaught of long-standing epidemics, especially multigenic diseases and viral epidemics. With it, comes the ability to target and manipulate genomes (and epigenomes) that were largely refractory to editing in the years predating genome engineering. Combined with therapeutic progenitor cells, they can address a wide swath of pathologies and answer fundamental scientific questions. However, recent efforts at genome editing of the human embryo 77, 193 raise both technical and ethical challenges. On the technical front, it is important to investigate the ramifications of off-targeting, mosaicism (somatic and possible germline), allelic complexity, the possibility of germline perturbation via mitochondrial replacement 194, and the biology of DNA-repair mechanisms 195, among other aspects. Looking askance, with a more ethical slant, one may wonder what the more far-flung effects of editing the human germline might be. Thus, the time is ripe to accelerate the path-to-the-clinic course of genome-edited and engineered cell-based technologies in a rigorous, albeit cautious, manner. Clinical translation of genome editing, alongside cellular reprogramming can cause a paradigm shift in gene therapy, permanently eliminating disease symptoms with engineered endonucleases. Thus, one can be cautiously optimistic that via extensive design and high-throughput experimentation, comprehensive bioinformatics filtration, and the use of creative, high-efficiency biomimetic platforms, maturation of the synergistic technologies described in this review will be intensely rewarding.",

        "Overview of the CRISPR-Cas9 mechanism of action. (A) CRISPR-Cas proteins, derived from the prokaryotic adaptive immune system, can target foreign DNA for cleavage using the CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Cas9 is obtained from Type II CRISPR-Cas systems and creates breaks in an approximately 20-nt strand of DNA that is complementary to crRNA, whose maturity is dependent on the trans-activating RNA, tracrRNA. TracrRNA is the RNA that shares partial complementarity with crRNA and binds to the Cas9 endonuclease. (B) Chimeric design of single-guide RNA (sgRNA) by fusing crRNA and tracrRNA, with multiplexing capability, and possible design considerations that can increase its on-target specificity. The sgRNA targets the Cas9 endonuclease to genomic sites complementary to its 5' end. Further, the target DNA sequence needs to be followed in sequence by a protospacer adjacent sequence (PAM), typically the NGG sequence. The five nucleotides that are upstream of the PAM sequence constitute the seed region for target recognition. (C) Two main CRISPR-Cas systems: (i) the wild-type Cas9 resulting in targeted gene knockout and (ii) the catalytically-inactive (non-cleaving) mutant dCas9 gene, with two silencing mutations of the RuvC1 and HNH nuclease domains (D10A and H841A), resulting in targeted gene knockdown (can be thought of as CRIPSR-i); both of which can be used for targeted genome editing in various species, including human cells. (D) The dCas9 mutant can be tagged to various effector molecules, resulting in DNA labeling, transcriptional activation or repression, or chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).",
        "Factors affecting CRISPR-Cas9 specificity, adapted from 141. The Cas9-sgRNA targeting specificity can be broadly classified into: (i) The intrinsic targeting specificity that is encoded in the Cas9 endonuclease and (ii) The relative abundance of the Cas9-sgRNA complex relative to the target concentration, with the Cas9-induced cleavage becoming less specific at higher Cas9-sgRNA concentrations, that is, with mismatches in the target sites being better tolerated. This is akin to the RNA-i non-canonical interference mechanisms. Further, CpG methylation and chromatin accessibility, the latter evidenced by DHS peaks, were found to affect off-target binding, such that lower CpG methylation and higher chromatin accessibility promoted off-target binding. Consequently, such off-target effects were significantly enriched at the regulatory elements of active genes, for example.",
        "Primary steps of CRISPR-Cas-based immunity. The mechanism of CRISPR-mediated interference can be summarized in three execution steps consisting of an information-processing subsystem (CRISPR adaptation) and a two-part executive subsystem (CRISPR expression and CRISPR-based interference). In the first step, adaptation, new spacers are inserted into the CRISPR locus and can either be naïve or primed acquisition, the latter resulting in acquisition of spacers from the same mobile genetic element. In the latter two steps, transcription of the CRISPR locus and processing of CRISPR RNA occurs, followed by the detection and degradation of the pathogen or mobile genetic elements by CRISPR RNA.",

Unfortunately, with the exception of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) for hematological applications, the current clinical results with stem cells are somewhat disappointing. The potential clinical applications of the more primitive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have so far been discouraging, as both have exhibited several problems, including genomic instability, a risk of teratoma formation, and the possibility of rejection. Therefore, the only safe stem cells that have so far been employed in regenerative medicine are monopotent stem cells, such as the abovementioned HSPCs or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from postnatal tissues. However, their monopotency, and therefore limited differentiation potential, is a barrier to their broader application in the clinic. Interestingly, results have accumulated indicating that adult tissues contain rare, early-development stem cells known as very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs), which can differentiate into cells from more than one germ layer.

      "abstract": "Background Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are two distinct yet interconnected neurological conditions that share overlapping pathological features, including amyloid-beta plaque accumulation, neuroinflammation, and progressive neurodegeneration. Individuals with DS are at increased risk of developing AD-like dementia owing to the overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein-encoding gene on chromosome 21. Despite significant research efforts, effective disease-modifying treatments remain unavailable for both conditions, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. Methods We analyzed and synthesized the existing literature on stem cell therapy as a treatment for DS and AD. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases, focusing on recent, high-quality, and peer-reviewed studies on stem cell therapy in DS and AD. Results The findings indicate that stem cell therapy represents a promising therapeutic approach for both conditions. Preclinical trials using neural, mesenchymal, and induced pluripotent stem cells have shown their potential to mitigate disease pathology, restore neuronal function, modulate neuroinflammation, enhance neurogenesis, and improve cognitive performance in DS and AD models; these findings suggest the viability of stem cell-based interventions as a disease-modifying strategy. However, despite promising findings, the efficacy and safety of these approaches require further validation through well-designed human clinical trials before clinical translation. Furthermore, AD research in stem cell therapy is currently more advanced than DS research, with a greater number of preclinical and early clinical investigations.

Conclusions While both DS and AD share common neurodegenerative mechanisms and are potential candidates for stem cell therapeutic approaches, the therapeutic focus varies.

        "Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by trisomy 21, which is the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is associated with intellectual disability, distinct craniofacial features, and hypotonia [1, 2]. Individuals with DS have an increased risk of developing AD-like pathology owing to the overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21 [3, 4]. Stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a promising, effective, safe, innovative, and potentially disease-modifying therapeutic approach for AD and DS. Various stem cell sources, including neural stem cells (NSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have been investigated for their therapeutic potential in these conditions [5–7].",
        "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, impaired memory formation, and disruption of neurocognitive functions; its hallmark neuropathological features include neural loss, neurodegeneration, amyloid-beta plaque deposition, and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Currently, approved medications offer only symptomatic relief without modifying disease progression [7].",
        "A growing body of evidence suggests that stem cell transplantation may exert beneficial effects through hippocampal neurogenesis, paracrine factor secretion, neuroinflammation modulation, and anti-amyloidogenic activity, thereby contributing to cognitive recovery [2, 6, 7]. However, despite the promise of stem cell-based therapy, challenges such as ethical considerations, safety concerns, and clinical feasibility remain [5–7].",

Given the ability of stem cells to differentiate into various cell types, they offer a unique avenue for addressing the underlying neuropathy of both disorders. This study aims to analyze and synthesize the literature on stem cell therapy for DS and AD, comprehensively examine the pathophysiological basis of both conditions, highlight their shared neurodegenerative mechanisms, discuss and compare the biology and therapeutic potential of different stem cell types and stem cell-based therapies in modulating disease progression, and critically assess their mechanisms of action, efficacy, benefits, and limitations.

        "DS, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 21 copy. This condition manifests through a broad spectrum of physical, cognitive, and clinical features, with significant variability among affected individuals. Physical traits often include distinctive facial features, including upward-slanting palpebral fissures, a flattened nasal bridge and face, and a protruding tongue. Additional physical traits can include hypotonia, short stature, a single palmar crease, and joint hyperflexibility. Individuals with DS also have an increased predisposition to medical conditions such as congenital heart defects, sleep apnea, immune dysfunction, and thyroid abnormalities.",
        "Cognitively, individuals with DS typically experience mild to moderate symptoms that vary widely among individuals, including intellectual disability, often accompanied by delayed language and speech acquisition, difficulty with learning new information, impaired short- and long-term memory, which may persist throughout life; and difficulties in executing executive functions. Challenges with attention, spatial visualization, problem-solving, and decision-making are also common. Despite these challenges, early intervention, tailored educational support, structured social environments, and comprehensive healthcare can significantly improve quality of life and cognitive outcomes [1, 2].",
        "AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily impairs memory, cognition, and executive function [8]. It is the leading cause of dementia, accounting for approximately 60–70% of dementia cases worldwide [9]. The early stages of AD are often subtle, with symptoms such as mild memory impairment and occasional confusion, which are often initially mistaken for age-related forgetfulness [10]. However, as the disease progresses, the symptoms become more severe and disruptive. Key symptoms include difficulty in recalling recent memories of events or conversations, being lost in familiar places, misplacing items frequently, struggling with complex tasks, mood or behavioral changes, difficulty with language processing, confusion, and spatial disorientation. In the advanced stages, individuals may have difficulty in speaking, swallowing, or walking, becoming completely dependent on caregivers; they might also exhibit difficulty recognizing loved ones, disorganized speech, severe mood swings, significant personality changes, and hallucinations. The neuropathological hallmarks of AD include widespread neuronal loss, synaptic dysfunction, and brain atrophy. The exact cause of AD remains multifactorial; however, genetic predispositions, environmental factors, and lifestyle influences have been implicated. Currently, there are no curative treatments for AD; however, the available therapies aim to manage symptoms, slow cognitive decline, and improve quality of life [8]. A combination of pharmacological interventions, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, which offer symptomatic relief, lifestyle modifications, cognitive stimulation, and caregiver support, play crucial roles in patient management.",
        "Individuals with DS have a form of genetically determined DS-associated dementia owing to the APP gene dose effect. Consequently, amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles are virtually universal by age 40, and the lifetime risk of developing dementia is greater than 90%. However, while DS-associated dementia shares amyloid pathology with AD, its developmental origins require distinct diagnostic criteria [3]. Approximately 40%–80% of individuals with DS develop AD-like dementia by the fifth to sixth decade of life. The similarities between the two disorders may be due to genetic overlap, as evidenced by the triplication of the gene that codes for APP in individuals with DS. Similarly, an extra copy of the APP gene causes familial AD in individuals without DS [4]. Therefore, dementia is now known to be the primary medical problem and leading cause of death in patients with DS [3]. The discovery that adults with DS have neuropathological features identical to those of individuals with AD played a key role in identifying the APP gene on chromosome 21 and resulted in the amyloid cascade hypothesis [11]. Thus, the shared genetic basis (APP gene on chromosome 21), amyloid-beta pathology, neuroinflammation, and progressive cognitive decline make DS and AD closely related. This has led researchers to advocate the use of DS as a natural model for studying AD and testing potential therapies [11–13].",
        "Stem cells are undifferentiated cells with a remarkable ability to develop into specialized cell types within the body [14]. These cells function as an internal repair system that can divide without limits. They contribute to replenishing and maintaining cells and tissues. Stem cells exist in multicellular organisms, including humans, and have two key characteristics. First, stem cells exhibit long-term self-renewal and proliferate extensively while maintaining their undifferentiated state. Second, they can differentiate into tissue- or organ-specific cell types with specialized functions under specific physiological or experimental conditions. Consequently, stem cells offer tremendous therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine and disease treatment [15].",
        "Various types of stem cells have been explored for potential therapeutic applications, depending on factors such as the specific disease pathology, target tissue, expected therapeutic outcome, and ethical considerations [16]. ESCs are derived from the inner cell mass of pluripotent early-stage blastocysts. They are considered pluripotent because they can differentiate into cell types from all three germ layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm [17, 18]. Their ability to differentiate into virtually any cell type makes them a powerful tool for regenerative medicine [19]; however, ethical considerations often limit their widespread application [20].",
        "iPSCs are adult somatic cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to a pluripotent state, allowing them to differentiate into any cell type. iPSCs circumvent the ethical issues associated with ESCs while offering immense potential for disease modeling and personalized therapeutic applications. Adult stem cells (ASCs) exist in various tissues and retain the ability to self-renew and differentiate into specific cell types within their tissue of origin. They are widely used in regenerative medicine because of their lower risk of immune rejection and ethical concerns [21, 22].",
        "ASCs include hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which contribute to blood and immune cell formation, and mesenchymal stem cells, which have shown the ability to generate various types of tissues, including bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue. NSCs are specialized self-renewing pluripotent progenitor cells capable of differentiating into all major neural cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, presenting a unique opportunity for treating neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, where neuronal loss is a prominent feature. While they are predominantly active during early brain development, they can also be found in the adult brain in restricted neurogenic niches in the subventricular zone and the granular layer of the hippocampus’s dentate gyrus. Adult NSCs are found in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone of the ventricle’s lateral wall [23, 24]. Somatic cell nuclear transfer-derived stem cells (SCNT-DSCs) are generated through nuclear transfer, where the nucleus of a mature somatic cell is transplanted into an enucleated oocyte to produce pluripotent stem cells. Although SCNT-DSCs are directly related to neuronal cells, the extraction technique is complex and ethically debated.",

Animal studies have shown the safety and efficacy of NSC transplantation for improving cognitive impairments [25, 26]. Some researchers have generated iPSCs from individuals with DS to produce neuronal cells [18, 21, 27–33]. These patient-derived iPSCs provide a valuable tool for disease modeling and personalized regenerative therapies. Although this approach is confined to laboratory research, it represents a significant step toward developing targeted stem cell-based therapies [22].",

Studies using mouse models carrying an extra chromosome 21 copy have also tested NSC transplantation in the developing brain [34]. Table 1 provides a summary of studies discussing stem cell therapy for DS. Preclinical studies, primarily conducted in DS mouse models, have explored NSC transplantation into the brain to improve cognitive function. Some of these studies reported improvements in learning and memory [35].

        "HSCs have been used in transplants to treat hematological and immunological complications in patients with DS. Historically, HSC transplantation has been used to treat people with DS, particularly those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or congenital heart disease [27, 36, 37]. These transplants are generally performed following high-dose chemotherapy or radiation therapy to replenish the blood cell population and restore immune function [22, 34]. Researchers have also explored the possibility of silencing the extra chromosome responsible for DS as a potential therapeutic approach. In a groundbreaking series of experiments, scientists have successfully manipulated cells derived from individuals with DS to suppress additional chromosomes, representing a major step toward potential chromosome therapy [38, 39].",
        "The Nutech Mediworld Clinic in India claims to have administered stem cell therapy to approximately 14 individuals with DS. The clinic also reported improvements in understanding, muscle tone, and recognition abilities in a baby with DS following stem cell therapy. However, experts have raised concerns about the lack of rigorous clinical evidence; unverified nature of the treatments; lack of controls; lack of standardized protocols, outcome measures, or established biological rationales; and the absence of concurrent therapies, which make it challenging to draw definitive conclusions [35].",
        "Despite promising advances in stem cell research, the journey from translating these preclinical studies into clinical practice for safe and effective human therapies remains challenging. Concerns include the risk of tumorigenesis, immune response complications, ethical considerations, uncontrolled stem cell differentiation, and the genetic complexity of DS. An extra chromosome 21 copy also affects multiple biological pathways, making it difficult to correct all associated impairments through stem cell-based interventions alone. DS-specific challenges, such as trisomy-related immune dysregulation, necessitate tailored clinical trial designs.",
        "The effectiveness of stem cell therapies largely depends on the specific condition being treated and the stem cell type used. Certain conditions, particularly those affecting the blood and immune system, such as leukemia or lymphoma, have achieved significant success with stem cell therapy using HSCs. Similarly, ASCs and iPSCs have demonstrated potential in regenerative medicine, with early-phase clinical trials indicating improved heart function following myocardial infarction.",
        "In neurological disorders, where the disease pathology affects widespread brain areas, achieving therapeutic success is more complex. Preclinical studies, primarily using NSCs or iPSCs, have demonstrated promising results in improving cognitive function and reducing neurodegenerative pathology in animal models of DS. However, stem cell therapies have several limitations. One of the primary challenges is controlling differentiation, avoiding the formation of unwanted cell types, and ensuring that transplanted cells differentiate into the intended cell type. Another major concern is immune rejection, where the body’s immune system may recognize transplanted stem cells as foreign and mount an immune response against them. This challenge is mitigated in autologous transplantation, in which patient-derived stem cells are used to reduce the risk of rejection.",
        "Stem cell therapies, particularly those involving ESCs, also carry the risk of tumor formation owing to their ability to proliferate rapidly. Furthermore, the use of ESCs raises ethical concerns, as their extraction involves the destruction of human embryos. A further challenge is the limited availability of certain stem cell types. Harvesting enough ASCs can be difficult; however, generating iPSCs is complex and time-consuming. Finally, genetic instability poses a risk in long-term stem cell culture, which can result in genetic abnormalities and impact the safety and functionality of the transplanted cells.For instance, trisomy 21 complicates autologous iPSC therapies owing to inherent genomic instability (30% aneuploidy vs. 5% in controls). In addition, DS microglia show reduced Aβ phagocytosis (40%↓ vs. typical AD models). Therefore, rigorous research and strict regulatory oversight are crucial to ensure safety and efficacy before stem cell-based therapies can be widely available to patients.",
        "Stem cell therapies for AD are still being explored and are not yet established treatment options. Ongoing research in this area explores the potential and feasibility of using stem cells to modify disease progression, combat neurodegeneration, promote neurogenesis, modulate neuroinflammation, and restore cognitive function. Past and present studies have used different stem cell types, including NSCs, MSCs, iPSCs, ESCs, and HSCs, with varying outcomes (Fig. 3).",
        "Fig. 3illustrates the sources and applications of stem cell therapy for AD. NSCs from the brain and spinal cord differentiate into neural and glial progenitors, forming neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. These cells replace damaged brain cells, potentially improving cognitive function in AD. MSCs, derived from sources such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, muscle, neonatal tissues, dental pulp, and skin, exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, secrete neurotrophic factors, and support brain repair by reducing neuroinflammation. iPSCs are generated from somatic cells through reprogramming and can differentiate into neural progenitor cells for transplantation. The lower section illustrates ESC development from in vitro fertilization. The embryo develops for approximately 5–7 days to become a blastocyst. ESCs are formed from the blastocyst’s inner cell mass and differentiate into various cell types, with a potential role in neural regeneration",

        "NSCs have been investigated for their potential to replace lost neurons and other brain cells. Animal studies have shown improvements in cognitive function following NSC transplantation into the brain. Key areas of ongoing research include understanding how NSCs can be harnessed safely and effectively [40]. Advances in NSC therapy and pathology mechanism research have provided greater insights into how these cells can be used effectively in the treatment of early-stage AD [6, 7].",
        "MSCs are the most extensively studied therapeutic stem cell type in AD research because of their accessibility, therapeutic potential, ability to cross the blood‒brain barrier after intravenous administration, and minimal immune response. MSC-derived exosomes, which can be produced from any donor, have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for AD with a lower risk of tumorigenicity [6, 7, 41]. Research has focused primarily on the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of MSCs in AD. MSC therapy has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation by clearing amyloid-β plaques, reducing hyperphosphorylated tau tangles in fibers, and suppressing abnormal protein degradation [6, 7]. Furthermore, MSC therapy enhances neuroprotection while downregulating proinflammatory cytokine levels. MSCs also participate in tissue repair by secreting extracellular vesicles and microvesicles.",
        "Bone marrow-derived MSCs can release extracellular vesicles that specifically target amyloid-β deposition; this process can be enhanced through genetic modification and therapeutic agents, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and enzymes [38]. Preclinical studies in AD mouse models have shown the potential of MSC therapy to reduce amyloid plaques and improve memory and cognitive function by restoring blood‒brain barrier integrity, regulating autophagy, and modulating acetylcholine levels [42]. However, these findings remain largely experimental and require validation in human trials [38, 42].",
        "iPSCs are derived from reprogrammed somatic cells, creating a physiologically relevant model that retains the donor’s genetic identity. iPSCs possess unlimited self-renewal capacity and can differentiate into various cell types, thereby making them valuable for disease modeling and potential therapeutic applications in AD [6, 7, 43]. In AD models, iPSCs have demonstrated preliminary efficacy in regulating endogenous neurogenesis, replacing lost neurons or reversing pathological changes [38]. A recent study revealed that protein-induced iPSCs combined with ferritin from mouse ESCs significantly enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation, minimized plaque deposition, and supported bilateral brain transplantation in 5× familial AD transgenic mice with AD. This study further suggested that protein-iPSCs could improve cognition in AD by reducing amyloid plaques and promoting oligodendrocyte-derived neuronal support [44]. Improved cognitive function emphasizes the unique role of stem cells, which possess the ability to differentiate into distinct cell lines.",
        "Despite promising outcomes, autologous iPSC-derived neurons may still exhibit genetic instability and neuropathological traits, such as excessive amyloid-β accumulation, shorter axonal lengths, and increased tau phosphorylation, which could compromise their therapeutic viability [45, 46]. Genome-editing techniques, such as recombinant homologs, transcription activator-like effect nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR-Cas9), have been used to overcome these limitations. Advances in automated iPSC reprogramming have also improved efficiency, reproducibility, and cell stability and quality, thereby increasing their potential for disease modeling and therapeutic applications. Furthermore, iPSC technology has been used to generate specific neuronal subtypes, including cortical pyramidal neurons and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), both of which are significantly affected in AD [38].",
        "Studies suggest that ESC-derived neurons can enhance spatial learning and memory in AD animal models by differentiating into BFCNs and γ-aminobutyric acid neurons [38]. However, the use of ESCs to treat AD is restricted by ethical and immunogenic considerations. Nevertheless, ESCs remain a valuable tool for modeling AD pathology in preclinical research [6, 7].",
        "Some early studies have explored HSC transplantation as a potential therapy for AD treatment [47, 48]; however, the findings have not revealed significant therapeutic benefits.",
        "A study published in Cell Reports [48] demonstrated that transplanting healthy HSCs into an AD mouse model resulted in improved memory and cognition, reduced neuroinflammation, and significantly lower amyloid-β accumulation. However, despite promising preclinical evidence, stem cell therapy for AD remains in the experimental phase, with multiple challenges to address. Key challenges include ensuring stem cell survival post-transplantation, guiding differentiation, and promoting integration into existing neural networks.",
        "Stem cell therapies for AD remain largely experimental, with most evaluations based on preclinical studies. Research has shown varying degrees of success in AD models using different stem cell types. Studies suggest that transplanted NSCs can survive, proliferate, and differentiate into neurons in the AD brain, resulting in partial restoration of neural connectivity, memory, and cognitive function [49]. Table 2 provides a summary of these studies.",

        "MSCs exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties and have been proven to significantly reduce neuroinflammation and improve cognitive function in AD models [43, 44]. iPSCs have been used to model AD, allowing for disease progression studies and drug screening. Some studies indicate that iPSC-derived neuronal cells can integrate into existing neuronal circuits and enhance cognitive function [6, 7, 50]. Early attempts to use HSCs for AD therapy have not shown substantial success [47, 48].",
        "However, despite these promising findings, significant limitations must be addressed before stem cell therapy can be translated into clinical practice. For instance, transplanted NSCs often exhibit low survival rates, reducing their effectiveness in long-term therapy [42, 52]. Controlling stem cell differentiation into specific neuronal subtypes is complex yet crucial for therapeutic success [38]. Successful neural circuit integration is vital for restoring lost function; however, this remains a major challenge [47, 48].",
        "As with any transplantation, there is a risk of immune rejection of the transplanted cells, causing complications [38]. Certain stem cell types, particularly ESCs and iPSCs, carry the risk of tumorigenicity [28, 38]. Finally, the use of ESCs remains controversial owing to ethical concerns surrounding embryo-derived stem cell procurement [38]. Overall, stem cell therapies for AD hold great promise; however, they remain in the research phase, with substantial challenges to overcome before they can be translated to the clinic.",

The therapeutic focus in DS has been on prenatal/adult NSCs and iPSCs [18, 22, 23, 31, 52]. Research has focused primarily on generating new neurons from these cells and enhancing cognitive function [21, 31, 41, 53, 54]. In contrast, the therapeutic focus in AD involves NSCs, MSCs, iPSCs, and, less often, HSCs. The goal is to replace lost neurons, reduce neuroinflammation, clear amyloid plaques, and model disease progression for drug screening [1, 6, 7, 16, 38, 42–45].

Different types of stem cells are better suited for specific disease mechanisms. For instance, NSCs and iPSCs are commonly used in DS and AD [22]; however, MSCs show greater promise in AD because of their anti-inflammatory properties and ability to modulate immune responses [43]. DS and AD stem cell therapies remain in the experimental phase; however, AD research is slightly more advanced, with more preclinical studies and clinical trials underway [38, 65].
