However, their broader application is limited by complex manufacturing processes and the necessity for lymphodepleting chemotherapy, restricting patient accessibility. We present an in vivo engineering strategy using targeted lipid nanoparticles (tLNPs) for messenger RNA delivery to specific T cell subsets. These tLNPs reprogrammed CD8(+) T cells in both healthy donor and autoimmune patient samples, and in vivo dosing resulted in tumor control in humanized mice and B cell depletion in cynomolgus monkeys. In cynomolgus monkeys, the reconstituted B cells after depletion were predominantly naive, suggesting an immune system reset.

        "RNA circularization is vital for circRNA therapeutics. Here, authors present two in vitro methods—PIET and CIRC—where CIRC employs intact self-splicing introns to generate circRNAs efficiently, and enables large circRNA generation, broadening the circRNA platform’s potential.",
        "mRNA therapeutics has demonstrated significant potential, paving the way for next-generation treatments across various fields1–3, including infectious diesease4–8, cancer vaccines9,10, protein replacement11,12, gene editing13–15, and immune therapies16–20. Despite its promise, the mRNA platform faces obstacles such as high costs for modified bases and a short in vivo half-life, which hinder further advancements21,22. To overcome these challenges, exploring alternative RNA platforms like circRNA offers a promising direction. CircRNA has demonstrated promise in the development of vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), achieving effectiveness without the need for base modifications, thereby establishing itself as a compelling candidate for next-generation RNA therapeutics23.",
        "Discovered in 1976, circRNA is a covalently closed, single-stranded RNA ring molecule that lacks free 5’ and 3’ ends. It has been found across numerous species24,25, displaying increased stability and an extended half-life compared to linear RNA26,27. In vitro-transcribed (IVT) circRNAs similarly exhibit improved stability23,28,29. Lacking a canonical 5’ cap structure, circRNAs can initiate translation through internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) or IRES-like elements28,30,31, enabling protein expression in both cells and animals23,28,29,32. This translational capacity has opened the door to numerous promising therapeutic applications23,33–37. In addition to coding functions, non-coding circRNAs also play crucial roles in RNA-based therapeutics38–41. Recently, circRNA-based therapeutics have progressed into clinical trials, with candidates such as RXRG001 (RiboX Therapeutics), HM2002 (CircCode Biomed), and TI-0083 (Therorna Inc.) representing the field’s translational momentum.",
        "In vitro RNA circularization techniques are fundamental to the circRNA platform, with methods including chemical synthesis and circularization42–45, ligases-mediated23,46,47, and ribozymes-mediated circularization28,48–51, each with distinct limitations52,53. Among these, self-splicing ribozymes, particularly from group I and group II introns, are frequently used due to their efficiency and simplicity, as they bypass the need for proteins. For instance, the Anabaena (Ana) group I intron has been engineered to produce circRNAs using permuted intron-exon (PIE)28,39,54,55, which is widely applied in circRNA-based theraputics23,33,34,38,39,56,57. PIE methods have shown potential for adaptation using alternative introns58 or different intron split sites59; however, achieving high circularization efficiency remains challenging, and only a limited number of introns are compatible with this approach. Group II introns also hold promise—particularly for producing circRNAs without exogenous sequences60 or with reduced levels of nicked RNA byproducts61. Additionally, the trans-splicing activity of group I introns has been applied to RNA circularization49–51, with high efficiency observed in several specific introns62.",
        "However, current RNA circularization platforms still face several limitations. The PIE method, for instance, relies on specific intron split sites, limiting its adaptability and efficiency when applied to other introns28,58,63. Efficient generation of large circRNAs—particularly those exceeding 9-kb—also remains a significant technical hurdle28,39,51. Additionally, the immunogenicity of in vitro-synthesized circRNA, likely due to impurities or foreign sequences (scars)29,64, calls for scarless, high-purity circRNA production.",
        "In this study, we report two RNA circularization techniques: Permuted Intron-Exon through Trans-splicing (PIET) and Complete self-splicing Intron for RNA Circularization (CIRC). PIET offers an alternative RNA circularization method, while CIRC stands out by effectively leveraging intact group I and group II introns, opening avenues to identify superior introns. CIRC surpasses PIE by increasing circularization efficiency and reducing the need for high concentration of Mg2+, high pH, and lengthy incubation times, supporting rapid RNA circularization and maintaining RNA integrity. With these capabilities, CIRC successfully circularizes RNA encoding full-length human dystrophin (about 12,000 nucleotides), enabling the expression of the 427-kDa protein. Additionally, CIRC enables efficient scarless circRNA production and streamlines purification using RNase R or oligo(dT)-based methods. These innovations broaden the potential of circRNA platform, enhancing its applicability in RNA therapeutics.",
        "Group I introns, which are self-splicing ribozymes, enable RNA splicing without protein assistance, functioning through a two-step transesterification reaction that requires guanosine as a cofactor65. Canonical RNA circularization using group I introns has been achieved with PIE28,54,55, which completes both transesterification steps (Fig. 1a). In the first step of group I intron splicing, exogenous guanosine (exoG), typically guanosine triphosphate (GTP) initiates an attack on the 5’-exon and 5’-intron junction, resulting in RNA cleavage and the addition of a single G at the 5’ end of the 5’-intron (Fig. 1a). Recognizing the potential to bypass the initial step, we directly attempted to omit it and evaluated the feasibility of completing the second step of splicing in PIE independently, leading to the development of a method called PIET (Permuted Intron-Exon through Trans-splicing). This method involves two separate RNAs functioning in trans (Fig. 1b), with the 5’ half-intron and intermediate generated independently in separate IVT reactions, then mixed for further reaction.Fig. 1RNA circularization via PIET and CIRC.a Diagram of PIE method for RNA circularization. b Schematic of the PIET approach for RNA circularization, showing the two components as intermediate and 5’-intron. c Assessment of 5’-intron, GTP, and Mg2+ requirements for PIET. d PIET method schematic comparing RNA circularization using different ratios of 5’ intron to intermediate against PIE. e Illustration of CIRC method for RNA circularization. f Agarose gel results depicting GTP and Mg2+ requirements for CIRC.

        "Intron splicing was observed under different conditions, identifying the 5’-intron and Mg2+ as essential factors, while GTP was not required, thus indicating the omission of the first splicing (Fig. 1c). To verify circRNA production, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated precise exon ligation (Supplementary Fig. 1a), while an RNase R assay further confirmed circRNA presence (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The product, treated with RNase R and poly(A), retained an unchanged circRNA length (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Additionally, transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with circRNA harboring an IRES-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter led to robust expression of EGFP proteins (Supplementary Fig. 1d) and demonstrated higher protein expression levels compared to its linear RNA precursors, indicating sufficient RNA circularization (Supplementary Fig. 1e). These findings collectively confirm that PIET effectively generates circRNA.",
        "PIET operates as a two-component circularization system, allowing for easy manipulation of the 5’-intron-to-intermediate ratio to enhance circularization efficiency. As the ratio was adjusted from 0 to 125, the efficiency improved with an increased supply of the 5’-intron at ratios >5 (Fig. 1d). Although PIET did not surpass PIE in circularization efficiency, its two-component system offers precise control over reaction initiation by enabling the timed addition of the 5’-intron as needed.",
        "Given that PIET successfully circularized RNA with a split intron, we hypothesized that a full, unsplit intron could achieve similar circularization (Fig. 1e). This led us to investigate whether an unsplit intron could facilitate efficient RNA circularization by utilizing the second step of splicing as PIET. Intron splicing was observed under various conditions, with Mg2+ identified as a limiting factor, while GTP was not required, indicating that this method bypasses the first step of group I intron splicing (Fig. 1f). RT-PCR confirmed precise exon ligation (Supplementary Fig. 1a), and an RNase R assay validated circRNA production (Fig. 1g). After RNase R treatment, the product was subjected to Poly(A) addition, and circRNA length remained unchanged (Fig. 1h). Similarly, HEK293T cells transfected with circRNA harboring an IRES-EGFP reporter showed efficient protein translation and higher expression levels compared to linear RNA precursors (Fig. 1i, j). These findings collectively confirm the efficacy of this RNA circularization approach.",
        "Additionally, we speculated that the homology arm required in PIE for split intron binding might be unnecessary (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Removing this homology arm significantly enhanced circularization efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 2b). This approach was named CIRC (Complete self-splicing Intron for RNA Circularization) due to its use of an intact intron. Importantly, CIRC differs from the trans-splicing-based circularization method that uses the trans-splicing activity of group I introns49–51, as that approach still depends on the first splicing step (Supplementary Fig. 2c).",
        "Before optimizing the construct sequence for CIRC, a key consideration was that the initiation base in CIRC precursors starts from a G at the 5’ end (Fig. 1e). For group I introns whose first base is not G, only one G is typically present at the 5’ end. However, T7 polymerase requires at least 2 Gs at the 5’ end for efficient transcription66,67. Since the Ana intron begins with an A, we investigated the effect of adding extra G at the 5’ end on RNA yield and circularization. To determine whether the additional G affected transcription and circularization, we compared RNAs with 1 G or 2 G extensions at the 5’ end, evaluating RNA yield and circularization efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 2d). The 2 G sample produced a higher RNA yield than the 1 G sample (Supplementary Fig. 2e). While the 1 G sample showed slightly better circularization efficiency than the 2 G sample, the difference was not statistically significant (Supplementary Fig. 2f). To balance RNA yield and circularization efficiency, we used a minimum of 2 Gs at the 5’ end for all CIRC precursors with group I introns in this study.",
        "To improve CIRC’s performance, we conducted sequence optimization, focusing on key elements such as exons, homology arm, and spacer sequences—all crucial for effective circularization and tested independently (Fig. 2a). Circularization rate was also critical to assess, as faster rates help preserve RNA integrity. We evaluated circularization at two temperatures, 37°C and 55°C, mainly reflecting circularization rate and maximum circularization efficiency, respectively.Fig. 2Optimization of CIRC.a Diagram of the optimization of CIRC construct, highlighting features examined in subsequent experiments. b−e Gel quantification results showing the effects of exon length (b−d) and homology arm length (e) on circularization efficiency. f FACS results illustrating EGFP expression levels in transfected cells with circRNA constructs containing varying homology arm lengths. g Gel quantification results illustrating the impact of spacer sequence on circularization efficiency. h Schematic of the final optimized CIRC construct.

        "We then investigated the minimum exon length required for effective circularization, testing 5’- and 3’-exon lengths ranging from 0-nt to 60-nt. When both exons were of equal length, at least 16-nt was required to achieve rapid and efficient circularization (Fig. 2b). Subsequently, we varied the length of one exon while keeping the other constant and found that a total exon length of 27-nt (16-nt for one exon and 11-nt for the other) was sufficient for effective circularization (Fig. 2c, d). For simplicity, we standardized each exon length to 16-nt in further experiments.",
        "We then explored the impact of the homology arm length on circularization, expecting that extended base-pairing would help align splicing sites. As anticipated, a longer homology arm significantly increased both circularization rate and efficiency, reaching nearly 100% efficiency with a homology arm longer than 150-nt (Fig. 2e). However, these sequence alterations are retained in the final circRNA product, potentially affecting protein expression. Testing circRNAs with various homology arm lengths in HEK293T cells, we found that arms longer than 75-nt impaired translation efficiency (Fig. 2f). Adding a spacer before the IRES partially alleviated this, though it didn’t fully restore protein expression (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Therefore, we limited the homology arm length to 19-nt to 50-nt to balance assistance with minimal impact on translation.",
        "To mitigate potential conflicts between surrounding sequences and exons during circularization, we tested different spacer sequences, positioning them as either outer or inner spacers (Fig. 2a). To assess this design, linkers of varying lengths were used as outer or inner spacers to circularize the same payload. We observed that the outer spacer accelerated circularization process and performed slightly better in efficiency than the inner spacer (Fig. 2g). Increasing spacer length further enhanced circularization efficiency (Fig. 2g). However, when examining the impact of spacer location on protein expression, the inner spacer showed superior, likely due to its positioning between the IRES and the homology arm (Supplementary Fig. 3c). The reduction in translation observed with the outer spacer group could be alleviated by adding an additional 30-nt AC30 spacer between the homology arm and IRES (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Considering the preference for a relatively short exogenous sequence, an optimized CIRC configuration was developed: a 16-nt exon on each side, a 19- to 50-nt homology arm, and a 30-nt outer spacer, achieving efficient and relatively fast circularization (Fig. 2h). For protein-coding circRNA, we also recommend including an AC30 spacer before the IRES, consistent with previous findings28. This optimized CIRC configuration (with the AC30 spacer before the IRES) demonstrated enhanced circularization without compromising translation efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f).",
        "Upon successfully achieving circularization and optimization via CIRC, we sought to identify additional key factors limiting RNA circularization. It has been observed that T7 polymerase-driven IVT often generates a heterogenous 3’ end68–71. Considering that the last base in the CIRC precursor aligns with the splicing site, we hypothesized that 3’ end homogeneity would significantly influence circularization. It has been reported that using DNA templates with modifications, such as 2’ OMe (2’ methoxy (OCH₃) group), can partially mitigate this effect72. We compared the circularization efficiency of RNAs generated from linearized plasmid, unmodified PCR products, and modified PCR products (Supplementary Fig. 4a). RNA generated from the modified PCR products exhibited the highest circularization efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Furthermore, it was reported that mutant T7 polymerase can produce RNA with greater 3’ end homogeneity than wild-type T7 polymerase73, may offering a more convenient way for RNA production in CIRC and enhancing circularization efficiency.",
        "In PIE method, introns require additional engineering to identify intron split sites and incorporate homology arms28,58. Since CIRC can facilitate circularization using intact introns (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2a), we hypothesized that other natural self-splicing introns could also be utilized to circularize RNA via CIRC. Using the optimized CIRC framework, we matched the intron and corresponding exon sequences to design the linear precursor (Fig. 3a). Initially, we selected a variety of group I introns from databases and previous studies, highlighting their significant diversity65,74–76. Potential circRNA generation and efficient intron splicing were observed in most of the selected group I introns, with the exception of those from Closterium tumidum (Ctu) and Trichocoma paradoxa (Tpa) (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3Use of additional self-splicing introns in CIRC for RNA circularization.a Diagram of the CIRC construct incorporating either group I or group II introns. b Agarose gel electrophoresis showing group I intron splicing and the generation of putative circRNA. c Agarose gel electrophoresis showing group II intron splicing and the generation of putative circRNA. d Agarose gel electrophoresis of putative circRNA generated by different group I introns following treatment with poly(A) polymerase. e Left: Quantification of gel data showing circularization efficiency for various introns.

        "Additionally, group II introns without a protein-coding open reading frame (ORF) in the DIV domain (Domain 4) were reported to function independently of proteins, also bypassing the generation of lariat intron77, suggesting their potential for CIRC-mediated RNA circularization. To better simulate the second step of group II intron splicing, we used a monophosphate at the 5’ end of the precursor. Since these group II introns reportedly have in vitro DNA/RNA cleavage activity77, we observed imperfect base-paring in the natural exon binding site (EBS) and intron biding site (IBS) sequences, which could potentially reduce cleavage of the final circRNA. We identified three group II introns from literature and database searches77,78, all of which could achieve putative circRNA generation through CIRC (Fig. 3c). We confirmed the presence of circRNA via poly(A) assays, observing no size change in the circRNA band (Fig. 3d). Upon transfecting these circRNAs into cells, we found that circRNAs led to higher protein expression than the linear RNA from Ctu and Tpa (Fig. 3e). Quantification of RNA circularization was also shown (Fig. 3e). Group II introns did not exhibit cleavage activity under our conditions, maintaining a circRNA band in the poly(A) assay and showing efficient protein expression (Fig. 3d, e).",
        "In summary, we successfully generated protein-coding circRNA using group I and II introns from various origins (Supplementary Table 1). These findings expand the range of introns applicable to CIRC, creating opportunities to identify introns with high-activity or some unique features. Among tested introns, those from Tetrahymena thermophila (Tet) and Azoarcus olearius (Azo) showed high circularization efficiency but did not significantly surpass the performance of the Ana intron. Given the Ana intron’s high efficiency and compatibility with the PIE method, we explored potential advantages of the CIRC method over PIE method, both using the Ana intron. The optimized CIRC with a 19-nt homology arm was compared to the reported PIE construct, which includes a 16-nt 5’ exon, a 52-nt 3’ exon, a 19-nt homology arm, and a ~20-nt linker serving as internal spacers28.",
        "We began by comparing the circularization efficiency of CIRC and PIE using four different payloads: IRES-EGFP-3' UTR, IRES-gaussia luciferase (Gluc)-3' UTR, IRES-firefly luciferase (Fluc)-3'UTR, and POLR2A, with payload sizes ranging from 336 to 2543 nucleotides. In all cases, CIRC demonstrated superior circRNA production compared to PIE (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 5a).Fig. 4Comparison between CIRC and PIE.a Quantified circularization efficiency of RNA in CIRC and PIE from agarose gel electrophoresis data. b Comparison of the recovery rate for the final purified circRNA of the correct size. c, d Comparison of Mg2+ (c) and pH (d) requirements. e, f Comparison of circularization rates at 55°C (e) and during IVT reactions at 37°C (f).

        "Another critical metric is the final yield of pure circRNA. A common approach to thoroughly eliminate linear RNA is to apply RNase R digestion following poly(A) polymerase treatment39,79,80. Using equal input mass for both CIRC and PIE products, we conducted poly(A) treatment and RNase R digestion, then quantified the final yield of pure circRNA. Analysis of the treated product revealed that CIRC-generated circRNA contained a higher proportion of monomeric circRNAs, appearing as distinct bands corresponding to their expected sizes, whereas PIE displayed a greater proportion of concatemers (Supplementary Fig. 5b).",
        "When comparing the recovery rates of monomeric circRNA, CIRC produced a higher yield than PIE, particularly with EGFP and Gluc payloads, and comparably with Fluc (Fig. 4b). Overall, CIRC showed a modest improvement over PIE, though PIE is highly efficient, making significant enhancements challenging. Consequently, we explored additional advantages of CIRC over PIE.",
        "Effective circularization via self-splicing introns relied on ribozyme activity, requiring optimal Mg2+ concentration, temperature, and reaction time. However, these conditions can promote non-enzymatic RNA degradation, especially in high Mg2+ concentrations, elevated temperatures, and extended incubation times81,82. Additionally, reaction pH affects RNA stability, while higher pH levels increasing RNA hydrolysis risk81. To optimize RNA integrity and circularization efficiency, these factors were systematically tested.",
        "CIRC demonstrated a lower Mg2+ requirement, achieving circularization with only 0.2 mM MgCl2, whereas PIE required around 3.2 mM MgCl2 (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, CIRC demonstrated the ability to perform circularization at a lower pH (Fig. 4d). These findings suggest that CIRC can efficiently circularize RNA while preserving its integrity by operating under lower Mg2+ concentrations and reduced pH conditions. Circularization rates were further evaluated at various Mg2+ concentrations at 55°C with 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulphonic acid (MES) at pH 6.5. At 4 mM Mg2+, CIRC exhibited a faster circularization rate than PIE (Fig. 4e). At 10 mM Mg2+, no significant difference was observed between CIRC and PIE (Supplementary Fig. 5c), while at 25 mM Mg2+, slight inhibition occurred in the second transesterification step of group I intron splicing, leading to faster circularization, lower final circularization efficiency, and the formation of more complex products in PIE (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Additionally, fewer concatemer were formed when using CIRC, indicating reduced intramolecular reactions under these experimental settings (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 5c, d). RNA circularization efficiency was assessed during IVT reactions at 37°C over various time points using a commercial IVT kit. CIRC achieved faster circularization than PIE in this IVT condition: CIRC reached higher circularization efficiency after 1 hr of IVT than PIE did after 16 hr (Fig. 4f). Although high Mg2+ concentrations, elevated temperature, and prolonged incubation times can compromise RNA integrity83–85, this issue appears to be minor for payloads with normal size.",
        "Overall, these unique features of CIRC support better circRNA integrity and improved performance for RNA circularization, which may be particularly important for large RNAs that demand both high circularization efficiency and preserved RNA integrity.",
        "With its high circularization efficiency and favorable performance under mild conditions, we hypothesized that CIRC could expand the maximum payload size for circRNA. To test this, we conducted IVT using CIRC with a circRNA encoding full-length human dystrophin protein. Initially, an abnormal band of incorrect size was observed, indicating that the correctly sized RNA was compromised (Supplementary Fig. 6a, second lane). We hypothesized that this issue was caused by the high activity of the intact intron, potentially leading to splicing or trans-splicing during transcription. To address this, we aimed to inhibit intron activity during IVT. We tested cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a GTP analog lacking a free 3’-OH group, which has been reported as a group I intron splicing inhibitor86. By adding cGMP to reach a final concentration exceeding 22.5 mM, we successfully generated the precursor RNA in CIRC (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Additionally, we formulated a custom IVT buffer that effectively suppressed group I intron activity for large payloads while optimizing Mg2+ concentrations to balance inhibition and IVT RNA yield. For this payload, all tested Mg2+ concentrations successfully inhibited intron activity. However, the 20 mM concentration resulted in low RNA yield, while the 40 mM concentration led to partial RNA degradation (Supplementary Fig. 6b).",
        "With intron activity successfully controlled during IVT, we evaluated CIRC across a range of payload sizes encoding proteins, spanning from 1448 to 12,206 nucleotides (Fig. 5a). For reference, we also presented the sizes of large payloads from other studies, such as SpCas9, truncated DMD, and Factor VIII-EGFP. (Fig. 5a). Spliced introns were observed in all payloads without noticeable impact on RNA integrity (Fig. 5b). For large payloads, distinguishing circRNA from its precursor in gel images proved challenging. To address this, we used RT-qPCR to qualitatively detect circRNA by measuring the abundance of circRNA junctions relative to linear precursors, as direct comparisons of relative abundance across different payloads were not feasible. All payloads showed a significant increase in circRNA junction abundance, indicating successful circRNA generation (Fig. 5c).Fig. 5Payload size limitations of CIRC.a Diagram illustrating payload types and sizes, with cited payloads from previous studies included. b Agarose gel electrophoresis showing spliced intron and RNA integrity of putative circRNA with varying payloads. c Qualitative validation of circRNA using RT-qPCR, since comparisons of the relative abundance of circRNA junctions across different payloads were not feasible. d−h Detection of protein expression for respective payloads: Gluc (d) and Fluc (f) detected with a microplate reader, EGFP (e) detected by FACS, and ABE8e (g) and dystrophin (h) detected by Western blot.

        "After successfully achieving RNA circularization, we evaluated whether these circRNAs could effectively express proteins. Cells transfected with circRNAs encoding various payloads exhibited robust, full-length protein expression, surpassing that of linear precursor RNAs (Fig. 5d–h). Notably, circRNA encoding human dystrophin protein achieved successful full-length protein expression (Fig. 5h). However, previous reports did not include any protein expression data on their largest construct39,51.",
        "An additional 16,835-nt payload was also tested (Supplementary Fig. 7a), demonstrating intron splicing with high RNA integrity and enriched relative abundance of circRNA junctions (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). However, full-length protein expression from this construct could not be detected via Western blot, possibly due to low expression levels of the chimera construct.",
        "In summary, CIRC expands the possibilities for circRNA-based applications by overcoming payload size constraints, and the exceptional integrity of large RNAs indicates that CIRC’s capacity has yet to reach its upper limits.",
        "Immunogenicity is a critical concern for circRNA, with impurities and scar sequences identified as major contributors to this issue29,64. CIRC aims to provide a method for producing high-purity circRNA without scar-related constraints, laying a foundation for investigating the sources of immunogenicity. Scarless circRNA production also aligns with the objective of replicating endogenous circRNA sequences. Prior to evaluating CIRC’s ability to generate scarless circRNA, we examined the scar elements in the optimized CIRC construct, which include exon, homology arm, and spacer sequences for efficient circularization. To minimize extraneous sequences, we removed both the homology arm and spacer sequence and shortened the exon sequence, aiming to utilize sequences commonly present in any RNA to facilitate easy swapping for circularization (Fig. 6a).Fig. 6Creation of scarless circRNA and immunogenicity testing.a Diagram illustrating the principle of generating scarless circRNA using CIRC. b Minimal exon sequence requirements when using the Ana intron in CIRC. c Diagram showing the programmable P1 stem within the Ana intron in CIRC. d Quantified circularization efficiency from agarose gel electrophoresis data for constructs shown in (c). e Diagram illustrating the approach to generate scarless circRNA by using an internal structure as the homology arm. f Quantified circularization efficiency from agarose gel electrophoresis data for scarless circRNA generation using various split sites within CVB3 IRES in CIRC. g A diagram illustrating the workflow for the detection of circRNA immunogenicity, created in BioRender.

        "The Ana intron has demonstrated functionality with short exon sequences87, so we tested CIRC using minimal exons and found that a 3-nt 5’ exon (CUU) and a 2-nt 3’ exon (AA) supported circularization with partial loss of splicing activity (Fig. 6b). This configuration revealed that a “CUUAA” motif within the payload can be used for scarless circRNA generation. Additionally, the 5’-exon sequence base-pairs with the intron to form the P1 structure of group I intron, allowing for sequence adjustments while preserving base-pairing and intron activity. In the 3-nt 5’-exon sequence, the final base of the 5’-exon forms a G-U wobble pair, which is considered crucial for the splicing activity of group I introns88. We tested all 16 alternative constructs by varying the other two bases in the 5’ exon, using a short payload POLR2A to assess their impact on splicing (Fig. 6c). The results indicated that all 16 pairs were capable of intron splicing with varying splicing efficiency (Fig. 6d). Thus, locating a “NNUAA” motif (or “NNUA” for potential reduced efficiency) in any RNA payload enables scarless circRNA generation. However, the effectiveness of other NNU motifs for RNA circularization should be carefully evaluated with specific sequence contexts.",
        "Beyond exon sequences, the removal of the homology arm and spacer might reduce circularization efficiency. Therefore, alternative strategies need to be explored to enhance circularization efficiency. Since these sequences aid in splicing site accessibility, we considered that secondary structures within the payload itself might serve a similar role (Fig. 6e). Given the highly structured nature of IRES, we applied the CIRC method while identifying splitting sites within the CVB3 IRES sequence. Sixteen different “NNUA” motif split sites within the IRES were evaluated, with three demonstrating exceptionally high splicing efficiency, highlighting the versatility of this strategy in generating scarless circRNAs (Fig. 6f). Among them, the split site at position 403, utilizing a UCU/AA motif, is recommended for generating scarless circRNAs containing the CVB3 IRES. By defining the minimal exon requirements and eliminating extra homology arms and spacers, the scar length was significantly reduced. The remaining scar sequence (NNUAA or NNUA in this case) could be located and replaced within the payload sequence to produce scarless circRNA.",
        "After achieving scarless circRNA production, we assessed the immunogenicity of circRNA with different scar lengths produced by CIRC in cells (Fig. 6g). Observation from previous studies indicated that purity, scar length, transfection dose, and phosphatase treatment influence immunogenicity. Initially, we synthesized the reported IRES-mCherry circRNA using the optimized CIRC construct64 and evaluated its immunogenicity at various doses, with and without phosphatase treatment, using modified or unmodified linear RNA and poly(I:C) as controls. Post-phosphatase treatment, circRNA exhibited low immunogenicity (Supplementary Fig. 8), showing similar results as previous report29. Besides, with doses over 0.1 μg per 24-well plate was sufficient to reveal immunogenic differences (Supplementary Fig. 8). We further explored the immunogenicity of phosphatase-treated circRNA with different scar lengths and added T4 RNA ligase-generated circRNA as a control, known for low immunogenicity64. However, no direct correlation was observed between scar length and immunogenicity, as all circRNAs exhibited low immunogenicity compared to unmodified linear RNA or poly(I:C) (Fig. 6h), suggesting that scar length has a minimal impact on circRNA immunogenicity. However, structure distortions caused by scars in specific sequence contexts may significantly influence immunogenicity89 and should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis.",
        "Additional phosphatase-treated circRNAs generated using CIRC were also evaluated. Circular RNA circPOLR2A, known for its low immunogenicity and therapeutic potential as a PKR inhibitor39,64,90, was successfully produced as a scarless circRNA using CIRC. This scarless circPOLR2A exhibited minimal immunogenicity, comparable to circPOLR2A generated by T4 RNA ligase (Fig. 6i). Furthermore, three additional payloads circularized with the optimized CIRC construct were tested for immunogenicity, and all demonstrated consistently low immunogenicity (Fig. 6j). These findings underscore CIRC as an effective platform for generating circRNA with minimal scar constraints and low immunogenicity.",
        "Unlike linear mRNA production, self-splicing intron-based circRNA generation produces additional byproducts, such as linear precursors and spliced introns, necessitating efficient circRNA purification methods for therapeutic applications. RNase R, a 3’ exoribonuclease, is commonly used in laboratories due to its effectiveness and simplicity in circRNA purification91,92. Comparing CIRC to PIE, we hypothesized that differences in RNase R resistance among linear precursors arise from variations in their 3’ ends. In PIE, the 3’ end of the linear precursor is embedded within the homology arm, a feature critical for RNA circularization28 but one that may increase resistance to RNase R digestion (Fig. 7a). Conversely, the 3’ end of CIRC’s precursor consists of the simpler 5’-exon structure, potentially making it more susceptible to RNase R digestion (Fig. 7a).Fig. 7RNase R or Oligo(dT) beads-mediated circRNA purification in CIRC.a Diagram depicting RNase R sensitivity of precursors in CIRC and PIE. b Agarose gel electrophoresis showing RNase R treatment of precursors in CIRC and PIE over different time periods. c Agarose-gel electrophoresis showing RNase R treatment of the 2-hr and 4-hr IVT RNA product in CIRC over varying durations. d Top: Diagram illustrating poly(A) insertion within the intron in CIRC.

        "When we treated the precursors from both methods with RNase R over varying durations, the PIE precursor showed greater resistance (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). Additionally, it has been documented that the Ana intron exhibits self-ligase activity, allowing the intron ends to ligate93. Our observations showed that the 5’ and 3’ ends of the intron ligated during prolonged IVT reactions or RNA circularization, resulting in the formation of a circular intron in CIRC and a bound intron in PIE, both of which resisted RNase R digestion (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Preventing intron ligation while achieving RNA circularization thus emerged as an effective strategy to enhance RNase R efficiency. Notably, CIRC allows for rapid circularization without intron ligation during IVT (Fig. 4f). To enhance RNase R digestion efficiency, we selected RNA samples shortly after initiating IVT using CIRC (Fig. 4f, IVT for 2 hr and 4 hr), which demonstrated effective intron digestion (Fig. 7c). In summary, CIRC’s expedited circularization process minimizes intron ligation through shortened reaction time, allowing for more effective RNase R digestion. Overall, CIRC demonstrated greater suitability for streamlined RNA purification with RNase R, offering a convenient approach for obtaining highly pure circRNA.",
        "Canonical circRNA purification methods depend on RNA exonucleases like RNase R79, size-based separation techniques like size exclusion chromatography (SEC)29, or specialized materials like wood-derived macroporous cellulose (WMC)94. In contrast, mRNA purification commonly employs oligo(dT) columns, which selectively bind to poly(A) tails95–97, offering a size-independent purification strategy. Considering that CIRC’s byproducts contain introns, we tested whether inserting poly(A) sequences into the Ana group I intron’s P6 domain would allow oligo(dT)-based removal of byproducts (Fig. 7d). To validate, we used RNA mixes with low circularization efficiency—achieved by employing short exons lacking spacer sequences—and evaluated the impact of poly(A) insertions up to 75-nt on splicing efficiency. The results showed only minimal impairment of splicing (Fig. 7e). Subsequently, we incubated a mix of circRNA and byproducts with oligo(dT) magnetic beads and collected the supernatant to assess circRNA enrichment. When the A insertions exceeded 25-nt, significant circRNA enrichment was observed in the supernatant (Supplementary Fig. 9d). Since the precursor was harder to remove due to its larger size, multiple rounds of bead incubation were effective, with three rounds completely removing both precursor and intron when the A insertions reached 34- and 75-nt (Supplementary Fig. 9e).",
        "Following this proof of concept, we applied a commercial oligo(dT) column to increase RNA purification throughput. We loaded RNA, both with and without A insertions in the intron, onto a commercial oligo(dT) column (Fig. 7d). The flow-through was collected and analyzed on an agarose gel. Encouragingly, the RNA was successfully purified, with most impurities removed, enabling efficient single-round purification (Fig. 7f). In summary, CIRC proved compatible with oligo(dT)-based RNA purification, offering a convenient and efficient method for obtaining high-purity circRNA. Although the insertion of a poly(A) sequence resulted in minimal impairment of intron activity, the ability to obtain high-purity circRNA with ease made this trade-off acceptable.",
        "This study presents two in vitro RNA circularization methods: PIET and CIRC, which utilize the second step of self-splicing intron processing to provide efficient methods for RNA circularization. CIRC has been optimized for high efficiency and demonstrates several advantages over the commonly used PIE, particularly in circularization efficiency and RNA integrity preservation (Figs. 2 and 4). Notably, CIRC is not limited by intron splitting and can leverage various natural group I and group II introns for RNA circularization, enabling the discovery of potentially superior introns for this process (Fig. 3). Additionally, exploring the diversity of self-splicing introns may further enable RNA circularization under diverse conditions, including in vivo.",
        "Current limitations in generating circRNA in vitro with payloads over 9000-nt28,39,51 restrict the broader application of the circRNA platform for large protein expression or loading multiple payloads within a single circRNA. Through advancements in CIRC, we extend the payload size limit, achieving circularization of large RNA while preserving RNA integrity (Fig. 5). This progress could expand the applications of circRNA, such as developing new protein replacement therapies for diseases caused by loss of function in large, full-length proteins, including DMD and Usher syndrome.",
        "Furthermore, ribozymes-mediated RNA circularization often leaves undesired scar sequences in circRNA, which are considered immunogenic and complicate the production of endogenous circRNA with identical sequences25,64. In contrast, CIRC enables efficient RNA circularization with minimal constraints on scar length (Fig. 6). We examined the impact of scars on immunogenicity and found no clear correlation, although further studies are needed to assess how structural distortions from scars may influence immunogenicity89.",
        "An important area for future optimization of the circRNA platform involves introducing chemical modifications as well as enabling protein expression within circRNA44,45. However, for protein-coding circRNA, modified IRES elements often lose their ability to initiate translation29. Identifying modification-tolerant IRES, directly incorporating specific caps or modifications into circRNA, and exploring alternative mechanisms for translation initiation are necessary to address this challenge. Recent studies have made progress in tackling this issue by incorporating cap structure within modified circRNA44,45. However, limitations remain on convenience and efficiency in the circRNA generation. Therefore, efficient circularization methods compatible with modified bases are needed. For ribozymes-based methods, certain RNA modifications can hinder ribozyme activity, limiting the ability to circularize modified RNA bases29,48. While trans circularization method utilizing unmodified ribozyme has been also developed, they do not resolve the issue of protein translation in modified circRNA51. To fully unlock the potential of circRNA-based therapeutics, it is essential to coordinate solutions for translation within modified circRNAs while developing scalable and efficient circularization methods. Advancements in these areas would significantly enhance the versatility of circRNA platform, paving the way for its widespread applications.",

        "The clinical use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is growing rapidly because of the expanding indications for standard-of-care treatment and the development of new investigational products. The establishment of consensus diagnostic criteria for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), alongside the steady use of both tocilizumab and corticosteroids for treatment, have been essential in facilitating the widespread use. Preemptive interventions to prevent more severe toxicities have improved safety, facilitating CAR T-cell therapy in medically frail populations and in those at high risk of severe CRS/ICANS. Nonetheless, the development of persistent or progressive CRS and ICANS remains problematic because it impairs patient outcomes and is challenging to treat. In this case-based discussion, we highlight a series of cases of CRS and/or ICANS refractory to front-line interventions. We discuss our approach to managing refractory toxicities that persist or progress beyond initial tocilizumab or corticosteroid administration, delineate risk factors for severe toxicities, highlight the emerging use of anakinra, and review mitigation strategies and supportive care measures to improve outcomes in patients who develop these refractory toxicities.",
        "With 6 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and many more showing promise in clinical trials, the need for hematologists to be aware of challenging complications and know how to manage them in routine practice is paramount. Introduced by Associate Editor Helen E. Heslop, this How I Treat series highlights several key complications, reviews current understanding of their etiologies, and provides guidance on therapies through discussion of illustrative cases.",
        "From the earliest experiences, it was clear that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is potent and that toxicity mitigation would be necessary to facilitate widespread use. Indeed, alongside the first approvals for CAR T cells, there was the concurrent approval of tocilizumab, an antibody against the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, to treat cytokine release syndrome (CRS).1 With time, improved recognition of toxicity profiles across various CD19-targeted CAR T-cell constructs facilitated the development of a consensus definition and grading system for CRS and immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).2 Entering this second decade of CAR T-cell therapy with more experience with antigen targeting across a breadth of novel constructs, we are better armed to prevent and manage CAR T-cell–associated inflammatory toxicities. Despite these advances, severe toxicities, including refractoriness to standard management with tocilizumab and steroids, still occur.",
        "Initially, use of tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids had been reserved for the treatment of severe CRS and/or ICANS. Now, however, there is an increasing use of these therapies at earlier stages to reduce the incidence of severe CRS and/or ICANS. Strategies include pre-emptive tocilizumab and/or steroids with lower grade toxicity to prevent onset of more severe manifestations,3, 4, 5 or even prophylactic treatment before any toxicity is observed.6 These strategies appear to be more effective at reducing CRS severity than ICANS, and there remains caution because of the concern that these interventions could affect longer-term CAR T-cell efficacy.4,7,8 With available strategies, there has been a paradigm shift toward prevention of ≥grade 3 CRS and ICANS.",
        "Although tocilizumab and steroids are first-line interventions for prevention and treatment of CRS and ICANS, respectively,9,10 data for outlining the treatment of refractory CRS and/or ICANS, defined, for the purpose of this manuscript, as persistent or progressive disease despite optimal use of tocilizumab and/or steroids, are lacking. Through a series of cases across the age and disease spectrum, we highlight (1) our approach for considerations and management of toxicities that persist or progress beyond front-line interventions; (2) strategies to identify patients who are at high risk of severe CRS and to consider risk mitigation; and (3) supportive care measures to be optimized among patients receiving increased immunosuppression.",
        "A 59-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) proceeded to CD19 CAR T-cell therapy with a bulky abdominal mass (>15 cm) after 3 prior lines of therapy. On day 0, he received tisagenlecleucel and developed grade 1 CRS (fever) on the same day. By day 3, he had progressed to grade 2 CRS with hypoxia and received tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg. Because of persistent fevers and worsening hypoxia, a second dose of tocilizumab was administered 8 hours after the first dose, and dexamethasone, 10 mg IV every 6 hours, was initiated. By day 4, ferritin continued to rise rapidly, tripling within 24 hours to 23 000 ng/mL, and he required transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) for high-flow oxygen and vasopressors. He developed disseminated intravascular coagulation with low fibrinogen, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury with serum creatinine ≥3 mg/dL. The corticosteroid dose was increased to methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily.",
        "Patients with high tumor burden and primary refractory disease are at high risk of both CRS and lymphoma relapse.11,12 Comparing CD19 CAR T-cell products in DLBCL, CARs incorporating 4-1BB (ie, tisagenlecleucel) have lower toxicity rates than products costimulated by CD28.13,14 Yet, severe CRS has been reported for all products. In patients at high risk or patients requiring repeat tocilizumab doses for lower grade CRS, management commonly incorporates ≥1 doses of dexamethasone 10 mg IV or orally (or, in children ∼1 mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent dosing). With persistent grade 2 CRS despite repeat doses of tocilizumab and/or single dose corticosteroids (such as in the patient in case 1) or with progression to grade 3 CRS, dexamethasone is often escalated up to 10 mg IV every 6 hours (equivalent dosing of ∼213 mg daily methylprednisolone). With grade 4 CRS, package inserts for commercially available constructs15, 16, 17 routinely recommend methylprednisolone 1 g IV per day and/or initiation of alternative CRS-directed therapies. Once a patient has received 2 doses of tocilizumab, repeat doses are generally not recommended, and consideration of both alternative etiologies and incorporation of additional therapies is imperative. Despite tocilizumab and escalating corticosteroids, this patient’s condition continued to deteriorate, prompting additional investigations to aid in the optimal management of refractory CRS.",
        "Concurrent infections were identified, including bacteremia with Staphylococcus epidermidis and a reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia (840 IU/mL); therefore, antibiotics and CMV treatment were initiated. Early restaging via abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan to check for progressive disease as a cause of refractory CRS showed stabilization of the abdominal mass. On the afternoon of day 4, he was then started on anakinra 100 mg IV every 6 hours for refractory CRS. The patient’s condition subsequently improved. Anakinra and corticosteroid doses were tapered over 1 week. He experienced a maximum ICANS of grade 1. His day 30 positron emission tomography/CT scan showed a complete metabolic remission.",
        "When a patient has clinical deterioration early after CAR T-cell therapy, the top differential diagnoses include refractory CRS, infection, and cancer progression. Infectious workup in this case included standard cultures performed at first fever and every 24 to 48 hours while the patient was persistently febrile as well as tests performed upon clinical deterioration, including evaluation for CMV/adenoviremia and other viremias, nasopharyngeal viral testing for respiratory infections, and chest and abdomen imaging to check for occult infection or disease progression. In this case, neither infection nor cancer progression explained the severity of the clinical presentation. Similarly, the patient had no evidence of gastrointestinal perforation or ischemia, which can occur among patients with abdominal lymphoma.18 For CRS refractory to high doses of corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone 10 mg IV, every 6 hours for 24 hours), the use of the IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, is often considered and will be discussed in later sections. Once a clinical response is achieved, anakinra and corticosteroids can be tapered as clinically indicated, and prolonged use at high doses is generally not indicated. Extra vigilance and enhanced antimicrobial prophylaxis is warranted, given the heightened infectious risks in patients treated with these immunosuppressive therapies,19,20 who may be further compromised with concurrent cytopenias. Although cytopenias are a complication of, and can further complicate, refractory CRS, this topic is discussed in more detail in an accompanying “How I Treat” article.21",
        "The optimal management of CMV reactivation is unknown, and most centers follow hematopoietic cell transplant guidelines.22,23 Close monitoring of organ function during severe CRS is also recommended. Notably, a rapid increase of lactic acidosis and/or development of acute kidney injury may necessitate urgent hemodialysis. Similarly, severe CRS may cause unstable arrhythmias or a sudden drop in ejection fraction.24",
        "A 71-year-old female with follicular lymphoma transformed to DLBCL was referred for receipt of CD19 CAR T cells for treatment of progressive nodal and extranodal disease refractory to 3 prior lines of therapy. She was not given any bridging therapy before axicabtagene ciloleucel. On day 2, she developed grade 1 CRS, with persistent fever until day 5, when she was given dexamethasone 10 mg IV once. On day 6, she presented with grade 2 CRS and grade 1 ICANS characterized by fever, hypoxia, and dysphasia, for which she received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg and dexamethasone 10 mg IV once.",
        "In older patients or those who are medically frail who receive CAR T-cell therapy, it is imperative to treat toxicity promptly and closely monitor for clinical worsening. In addition, clinicians should consider early intervention for patients at high risk of developing severe CRS/ICANS, including patients with bulky disease or a high tumor burden. Early intervention with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids at lower CRS and ICANS grades, and other toxicity reduction strategies, have been reported from nonrandomized clinical trials (Table 1). In cohort 4 of the ZUMA-1 study, patients with DLBCL treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel received early intervention at lower grade toxicities, including an IV dose of tocilizumab and/or dexamethasone 10 mg after 3 days of persistent of grade 1 CRS.31 Although the rates of severe CRS and ICANS in cohort 4 appeared lower than those observed in cohorts 1 and 2 of the ZUMA-1 study, this was confounded by the fact that the baseline tumor burden was much higher in cohorts 1 and 2 than that in cohort 4. Propensity score matching revealed that early intervention was associated with lower rates of severe toxicity; however, this analysis was limited to matching known factors and might not have balanced all the differences between cohorts. It was also found that earlier intervention with corticosteroids may help to limit a more prolonged course of corticosteroids. For example, the comparison of cohorts 1 and 2 with cohort 4 found that the median overall corticosteroid exposure declined from 6886 mg to 939 mg with earlier use of corticosteroids.31 Overall, the trend in clinical practice is toward intervening earlier at lower grades of CRS and ICANS. For elderly patients, there are limited outcome data after CAR T-cell therapy. Ram et al compared clinical outcomes in geriatric patients (n = 41; mean patient age, 76 years) with those in younger patients (n = 41; mean patient age, 55 years).34 The study showed no significant differences in grade ≥3 CRS, grade ≥3 ICANS, hospitalization duration, progression-free survival, or overall survival. These results, as well as findings from other studies, suggest that age alone is not a driving factor for toxicity severity.35, 36, 37 However, in patients who may not tolerate prolonged low-grade CRS (such as elderly patients or those who are frail) or patients who are at high risk of subsequent progression to severe toxicities, we recommend early intervention with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids during lower grade toxicities. Although results of studies incorporating prophylactic corticosteroids are promising,28 additional studies are needed before systematically incorporating the prophylactic use of steroids for risk mitigation.Table 1.Select strategies to prevent severe CRS and ICANSStrategyDisease/productOutcomeComparison∗CommentsReferenceFractionated CAR T-cell dosing Fractionated dosing: day 1 (10% dose), day 2 (30%), and day 3 (60%), with day 2 and day 3 doses allowed to be held for early CRS.Adult B-ALL treated with CD19 CAR T cells.Fractionated dose: grade ≥4 CRS, 5% (Penn grading scale) Grade ≥3 neurotoxicity, 6%.High fixed dose: grade ≥4 CRS, 50%; 3 of 6 patients died.Difficult to implement with fixed-dose commercial CAR T-cell products.Frey et al25NCT02030847Prophylaxis Prophylactic tocilizumab given on day 2.Adult DLBCL treated with axi-cel.Prophy toci: grade ≥3 CRS, 3%.

        "Subsequently, on day 8, despite concurrent improvement in CRS to grade 1, the patient showed global aphasia and epileptiform activity upon an electroencephalogram, consistent with grade 3 ICANS. For treatment of ICANS, she received methylprednisolone 1 gm IV daily for 2 days followed by a dexamethasone taper to discontinuation over 2 weeks. She also received anakinra 100 mg IV every 6 hours, which was tapered over a 10-day course. She had been on seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam (500 mg daily) before CAR T-cell infusion, yet per the guidance of a neurology consultation, levetiracetam was increased to therapeutic doses and 2 additional antiepileptics, lacosamide and phenytoin, were initiated to control seizure activity. Given the need for more frequent monitoring of her neurological status, she was treated in the ICU for several days. Upon resolution of CRS and ICANS, she was noted to have CMV viremia, cytopenias, and severe deconditioning, which substantially prolonged her inpatient stay. Her day 30 positron emission tomography/CT scan showed a complete metabolic remission, and she was ultimately discharged from the hospital on day 65 after CAR T-cell infusion.",
        "As noted in our cases, corticosteroids are generally accepted for refractory CRS (as in case 1) and as first-line therapy for ICANS (as in case 2) and are prescribed for treatment of concurrent CRS and ICANS (also noted in case 2).38 Dexamethasone is frequently recommended for ICANS because it crosses the blood-brain barrier.10 However, package inserts for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved CD19 CAR T-cell products recommend dexamethasone or methylprednisolone for the treatment of severe ICANS.15, 16, 17",
        "There are conflicting data on the impact that corticosteroid exposure has on CAR T-cell efficacy, with some studies noting no change in the efficacy,4,8,28 whereas others show decreased efficacy.7,39 Nonetheless, for recurrent, concurrent, or refractory toxicities, patients often receive prolonged courses of high-dose corticosteroids. Although corticosteroids aim to decrease CAR T-cell–associated inflammation, they also cause several deleterious side effects, including hyperglycemia, muscle weakness, and increased risk of infection. Accordingly, it is often not necessary for patients to have complete resolution of CRS/ICANS before weaning or discontinuing corticosteroids, and time alone may aid in resolution of symptoms because the inflammatory state is generally self-limited.",
        "Given the data in support of the role of IL-1 in the pathophysiology of ICANS, including elevations in the cerebrospinal fluid associated with ICANS40 and mechanistic preclinical models of CAR T-cell–associated toxicities elucidating the impact of IL-1 and improvement after its blockade,41,42 anakinra has been increasingly used to treat refractory ICANS. Anakinra is a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist that is FDA-approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Preliminary data from an ongoing phase 2 study testing prophylactic anakinra to prevent CRS and ICANS show promising results30; however, its evaluation among pediatric patients is urgently needed.43 The use of intrathecal corticosteroids has also been reported for use in severe or refractory ICANS, yet its use as a systemic steroid-sparing therapy warrants prospective study.44 Furthermore, the use of intrathecal therapy may be limited by concurrent thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy observed in patients with concurrent CRS.",
        "A 15-year-old male with constitutional trisomy 21 and relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) was referred for commercial tisagenlecleucel. He presented with 30% bone marrow blasts with low-level circulating peripheral blasts.",
        "Compared with the general public, patients with Down syndrome (DS) are at a higher risk of developing hematologic malignancies,45 and despite generally good outcomes,46 they are uniquely sensitive to chemotherapy-associated toxicities and do poorly with highly-intensive cytotoxic regimens, particularly in relapse. Emerging data on the use of CD19 CAR T cells in children and young adults with DS show promising response rates and safety profiles, including the incidence and severity of ICANS. These data are comparable with the data of those without DS,47 despite an increased risk of seizures when using blinatumomab in patients with DS.48 For this patient, high disease burden increased the risk of developing severe CRS.",
        "The patient remained with 30% marrow involvement after bridging chemotherapy and proceeded to LD chemotherapy and CAR T-cell infusion. He was on physiologic hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency. He developed fever, representing grade 1 CRS, on day 5. Although initially responsive to supportive measures (eg, acetaminophen and stress-dose hydrocortisone), he developed more persistent fevers, hypotension, rising creatinine, and decreasing urine output (grade 2 CRS) over 3 days, and he was given tocilizumab 8 mg/kg for persistent grade 2 CRS to prevent grade 3 CRS.",
        "For patients with established or suspected adrenal insufficiency (eg, from prior corticosteroid use), maintenance of physiologic dosing with escalation to stress-dosing during CRS should be considered, particularly because it may help maintain hemodynamic stability and offset the need for higher doses of corticosteroids.",
        "Consistent with the preemptive strategies tested by Gardner et al, which applied an early intervention strategy of tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids for CRS mitigation in children and young adults with B-ALL, tocilizumab was given for persistent symptoms of mild CRS and before the development of life-threatening toxicities (eg, grade 3 CRS).4 The approach of preventing more severe CRS/ICANS in children and young adults (as opposed to treating grade 1 CRS in older more frail adults) may be a unique consideration of younger patients in which baseline comorbidities may be less severe. Hence, patients may be able to better tolerate grade 2 CRS/ICANS without more severe complications. In patients with DS, unique comorbidities (eg, tolerance of fluid shifts in the setting of congenital cardiac complications) may necessitate consideration of earlier interventions.",
        "After tocilizumab, the patient became afebrile, and CRS resolved. Approximately 10 days later, he developed a rapidly rising ferritin level (>100 000 μg/L) and hepatic transaminitis (>10 × upper limit of normal [ULN]), disproportional to C-reactive protein, which was decreasing. The patient also developed severe hypofibrinogenemia (<100 mg/dL), although prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal. Despite stable vital signs, laboratory parameters worsened, prompting the initiation of methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg per day) and anakinra (8 mg/kg per day) to treat hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-like complications. After a short course of steroids and 1 week of anakinra with tapering doses, laboratory values normalized. He achieved a minimal residual disease–negative complete response. Given additional immunosuppression, he remained on antifungal prophylaxis while on both high-dose steroids and anakinra.",
        "HLH-like toxicities are increasingly being recognized as a potential complication of CAR T-cell–based therapies and can be severe and life-threatening. Recently termed as immune effector cell–associated HLH-like syndrome (IEC-HS) through an American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) effort, this hyperinflammatory syndrome manifests with cytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, hypofibrinogenemia, and hyperferritinemia.49 Because both primary/familial and secondary forms of HLH are pathologically linked to T-cell activation and immune dysregulation, this complication can be particularly challenging to diagnose with underlying hematologic malignancies.50 Initially described as part of severe CRS,51, 52, 53 more recent reports have described delayed manifestations of HLH-like toxicities even with low-grade CRS, particularly in patients receiving CD22 CAR T cells.54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61 In B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeting CAR T-cell therapies, in which severe CRS is less frequent, HLH-or macrophage activation syndrome-like toxicities are also becoming more apparent54 and are listed as potential toxicities on the FDA-approved package inserts.",
        "In case 3, anakinra and corticosteroids were used as first-line strategies based on the established role of both agents in treatment of primary62 or secondary HLH.63,64 This approach has been recently endorsed by the ASTCT Committee on Cellular Therapy, although further study is needed.49 Importantly, given the clinical presentation and stable vital signs (eg, afebrile and normotensive), tocilizumab was not indicated as per standard CRS guidelines, highlighting the need to distinguish the presentation and treatment of IEC-HS. Multicenter efforts to establish the clear criteria to facilitate an improved understanding of this toxicity and formulate the optimal treatment approach are ongoing. This is particularly important in cases of refractory IEC-HS that are nonresponsive or progressive to first-line approaches. Therapeutic strategies for refractory IEC-HS remain under study but include ruxolitinib,65 emapalumab,66 and etoposide.49",
        "Managing refractory CRS and ICANS after it has already developed remains a challenge. Importantly, because not all severe cases are refractory and may be effectively managed with tocilizumab and corticosteroids alone, distinguishing toxicities responding to first-line approaches from those in which additional investigations and/or interventions are needed is a critical consideration. Nonetheless, because developing severe or refractory toxicities impairs outcomes, early identification and pre-emptive interventions in those at high risk may help improve outcomes. Several principles emerging from clinical trials and real-world settings provide insights into risk factors associated with severe CRS.

        "The underlying cancer diagnosis influences toxicity, with highly proliferative aggressive diseases, such as DLBCL and B-ALL, at higher risk of severe CRS/ICANS than diseases, such as follicular lymphoma or myeloma.67 Similarly, within indolent lymphomas, marginal zone lymphoma has a higher rate of CRS/ICANS than follicular lymphoma,68 and transformed marginal zone lymphoma may be at higher risk rate than transformed follicular lymphoma or de novo DLBCL. However, severe and refractory CRS and ICANS may occur in any disease type, especially among patients who are heavily pretreated and refractory. For example, a recent analysis of myeloma patients treated with BCMA CAR T-cell therapy in the real-world setting reported 3 deaths attributed to CRS or neurotoxicity.69 At present, management recommendations for cases of severe and refractory CRS or ICANS are generalizable across disease types. Finally, emerging evidence suggests that tumor biology affects the risk of toxicity, given that the increased regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment has been linked to decreased risk of ICANS in patients with DLBCL.70,71",
        "A high tumor burden is a key risk factor for toxicity, often associated with higher inflammatory cytokine levels and CAR T-cell expansion.12,72, 73, 74, 75, 76 High disease burden is also associated with an increased risk of relapse after CAR T-cell therapy even though remission rates are often comparable.75,77, 78, 79 Furthermore, patients who experience severe CRS are at a higher risk for CAR T-cell failure.80 Accordingly, patients with rapidly progressive disease, high tumor burdens, or poor performance status may be better candidates for therapies other than CAR T cells. Similarly, systems issues such as late referrals, delays in insurance approval, or difficulty in manufacturing the CAR product may increase patient risks as the tumor burden grows and performance status worsens.81 In some instances, debulking patients before CAR T-cell therapy can be tried, although patients receive CAR T-cell therapy because they are resistant to other treatments. Therefore, patients should be identified early and moved toward CAR T-cell infusion as quickly as possible. For large masses, debulking radiation is often used as bridging therapy; however, radiation can be inflammatory and may not lower CRS risk, and the optimal timing, dose, and field for bridging radiation therapy are unknown.82, 83, 84",
        "CAR T-cell products vary in the likelihood of causing severe toxicity and depending on the disease treated. For instance, in DLBCL with CD19 CAR T cells, CD28-costimulated CAR T-cell products demonstrate higher rates of CRS and ICANS compared with 4-1BB-costimulated products.13 In addition, ICANS may be more severe when targeting CD19, potentially because of the on-target, off-tumor targeting of CD19 on brain mural cells.85 Unique movement-related toxicities have been observed when targeting BCMA, possibly because of off-tumor expression of these targets in, and around, the brain (discussed in more detail in an accompanying “How I Treat” article122).85,86 Even when the target and costimulatory domain are identical, kinetics of toxicity may differ between products, which, in turn, affect clinical management. With myeloma, CRS associated with idecabtagene vicleucel typically starts within a few days, whereas with ciltacabtagene autoleucel, CRS may start as late as a week after infusion. When multiple CAR T-cell products are available for a given disease, consideration of a product with potentially lower toxicity should be balanced against any perceived efficacy differences between products, because tumor eradication is the goal. Development of novel CAR T-cell constructs designed to reduce toxicity are actively being developed.",
        "Despite best efforts, patients may remain at high risk at CAR T-cell infusion. Although data are limited, the prophylaxis and early treatment of CRS appear to play a role in preventing subsequent severe toxicity (Table 1). Interpreting these single-arm trials can be challenging because rates of severe CRS and ICANS depend on histology, tumor burden, and CAR T-cell product type. Caution is needed because there are limited data on the effect of these interventions on antitumor efficacy, and patients at lower risk typically do not need these interventions. Greater attention to supportive care is also warranted, because patients with high tumor burden and inflammatory markers are also at a higher risk of developing cytopenias and infections.19,87 In addition, because conventional treatment paradigms and data on the impact of interventions on CAR T-cell efficacy are derived from experiences with B-cell malignancies, increased vigilance will be needed to optimize treatment of new emergent toxicities across novel constructs or diseases, in which unique considerations may necessitate alternative approaches.",
        "Recent efforts to identify biomarkers or develop risk scores (eg, CAR-HEMATOTOX and mEASIX) based on clinical laboratory parameters remain of great interest in aiding further risk stratification for associations with inflammation, delayed toxicities, or overall outcomes.19,87, 88, 89, 90 Further study of such biomarkers is warranted to determine the ability to predict poor response to standard CRS/ICANS interventions.",
        "Evidence-based data on the use of pharmacologic interventions for treatment of severe and/or refractory toxicities (Table 2) are generally lacking and limited to single-institutional experiences or case reports, preclinical data, T-cell–directed mechanisms of action, or adopted for use based on efficacy in alternative hyperinflammatory settings. Risk of infection with additive use of immunosuppressive agents is a concern and consultation with infectious disease specialists is suggested to optimize infection surveillance strategies and use of prophylactic/preemptive antimicrobials.22Table 2.Pharmacologic strategies being explored for potential use in severe/refractory CRS/ICANSTherapeutic categoryAgentMechanism of actionFDA-approved indicationDescription of use with CRS/ICANSProspective study in CRS/ICANSAnti-cytokine directedAnakinraIL-1 receptor antagonistReduction in signs/symptoms and to slow the progression of damage in adults with moderately to severely active RA who have failed ≥1 DMARDs, or for treatment of neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder.Preclinical data supporting the role of IL-1 in mediating CRS/ICANS, alongside the impact of IL-1 blockade in treatment of CAR T-cell toxicities.41,42Other clinical experience has been largely based on single-center/limited patient experiences and/or anecdotal reports.

        "Across all 3 refractory cases presented in this article, anakinra emerged as a common agent used after tocilizumab and/or with corticosteroids. Based on the data supporting IL-1 signaling in the pathogenesis of ICANS41,42 and its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, it has been proposed for steroid-refractory CRS/ICANS. In early reports of patients with refractory CRS, anakinra has been reported to decrease inflammatory cytokine levels and provide some clinical responses, but variability in clinical use makes it difficult to determine the extent of benefit.20,43,44,57 As anakinra is commonly used after corticosteroids and tocilizumab, the increased immunosuppression raises concern for increased risk of infections; therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones and mold-directed antifungals are often initiated or intensified for patients who are not already on these agents. Prospective trials to evaluate anakinra for prevention and treatment of CRS and/or ICANS (NCT04148430, NCT04359784, and NCT04150913) will provide much needed insight into the role of this important therapeutic. In the setting of IEC-HS, anakinra alone, or in conjunction with corticosteroids, may be able to effectively mitigate this toxicity to full resolution.55,91",
        "When patients have severe or refractory CRS and/or ICANS, the last resort is often to try to target the remaining CAR T cells. Anti-CAR T-cell–directed interventions may include chemotherapy, T-cell–directed therapies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or CAR construct–directed therapies (Table 2). However, experience is limited, and infection risk of such strategies may be particularly high, especially when given after multiple prior immunosuppressive approaches.",
        "When patients develop high-grade, recurrent, or refractory CAR-mediated toxicity, they are at a risk of increased morbidity and mortality.112 Often, management of CRS and/or ICANS results in a protracted hospital stay, increased exposure to immunosuppressive medications, greater risk of infection, and worsening of the patient’s functional status. To diminish the impact that these unintended consequences may have on the long-term benefit of CAR T cells, attention should be given to supportive care measures (Table 3).Table 3.Supportive care measures for patients with severe/refractory CRS or ICANS Neurology • Identify patients at high risk of developing ICANS and engage neurology early113 • Tailor duration of steroids in patients with severe ICANS to treat toxicity but limit adverse side effects Immune/hematologic • Limit the duration of high-dose steroids for the management of toxicity to diminish immune suppression • Use cytokine-directed treatments, such as anakinra, as a steroid-sparing approach20,43,57 • Optimize approaches to treat ongoing cytopenias Infectious disease • Use prophylactic antimicrobials, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis22 • Use prophylactic antivirals, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir, for herpes virus prophylaxis before conditioning chemotherapy22 • Practice antibiotic stewardship with broad-spectrum antibiotics and blood cultures for patients with neutropenic fever114,115 • Assess for CMV, adeno- or other viremias in patients with persistent cytopenia after treatment • Optimize antifungal prophylaxis in patients with prolonged immunosuppression due to CRS/ICANS management and cytopeniasRehabilitation • Involve inpatient rehabilitation services for patients, particularly those with lengthy hospital stays or those who received prolonged steroids, after they are clinically stable • Encourage engagement of caregivers and social workersCognitive/psychosocial • Consult psychiatry or psychiatric oncology to aid in the management of delirium, particularly in older or pediatric patients who develop ICANS",
        "Supportive care measures for patients with severe/refractory CRS or ICANS",
        "As discussed earlier, patients with severe or refractory CRS and/or ICANS typically receive prolonged courses of high-dose corticosteroids with other immunosuppressive agents. The recommendations delineated in Table 3 primarily focus on strategies to limit the adverse effects of these medications. First, to mitigate the deleterious effects of corticosteroids, the use of steroid-sparing, cytokine-directed medications for prophylaxis, or treatment of CAR-mediated toxicity should be assessed.6",
        "Second, several studies have found that infectious complications are frequent after CAR T-cell therapy. Severe CRS and prolonged corticosteroid exposure are risk factors for severe infections.19,116, 117, 118, 119 Given these findings, prophylactic antimicrobials are essential to reduce infections, including emergence of latent and opportunistic infections.115 Although exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting obligate anaerobes (eg, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and imipenem/cilastatin) within the 4 weeks before CAR T-cell therapy has been associated with worse outcomes, possibly because of alterations in the intestinal microbiome,114 the impact of antibiotics administered after CAR T-cell therapy is not yet known.",
        "Multiple factors, including CRS and ICANS, immobility, malnutrition, infection, and the catabolic effects of prolonged corticosteroids (Table 2), may lead to a deterioration in the conditioning and mental status of patients after CAR T-cell therapy. For such patients, early considerations for rehabilitation to address deconditioning and steroid myopathy that may result in proximal limb weakness is needed.120 Emerging research also suggests the presence of short- and long-term biobehavioral effects of CAR T-cell therapy,121 but more work is needed in this area to understand the long-term implications for patients who experience severe or refractory CAR-mediated toxicities.",
        "Given the tremendous potential of CAR T cells, preventing and effectively managing severe toxicities remain the highest priority. Although we await results from prospective trials testing novel approaches, we outline considerations that are critical to the optimal management of those experiencing refractory toxicities.",

        "Since the first approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has become a major component in the arsenal against B-cell malignancies including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma (MM). To date, six products targeting either CD19 or B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) have been approved in the U.S. (Cappell and Kochenderfer, 2023), with a large number of ongoing trials evaluating additional candidates targeting both hematological malignancies and solid tumors (Wang et al., 2023). In addition, CD19 CAR-T cell therapies have recently been applied to the treatment of autoimmune diseases, with early data showing promising outcomes for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (Mackensen et al., 2022).",
        "Successful expansion of CAR-T cell therapy to solid tumors and indications beyond cancer is highly dependent on the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cell products. CAR construct design and strategies by which CAR-T cells can be engineered to promote fitness, persistence, and antitumor efficacy have been reviewed in detail in several recent articles (Gao and Chen, 2022; Hamieh et al., 2023; Hou et al., 2021; Labanieh and Mackall, 2023). Here, we focus our attention on autologous CAR-T cell manufacturing, which plays a critical role in the clinical impact of CAR-T cell therapy by influencing the phenotype and function of the CAR-T cell products (Ceppi et al., 2022; Wang and Rivière, 2022). Although many of the aspects discussed in this review also apply to the manufacturing of allogeneic CAR-T cells, additional considerations exist for the engineering of donor T cells or the differentiation of stem cells into T-cell products, and discussions on these topics can be found in several excellent articles (Depil et al., 2020; Jing et al., 2022; Seet et al., 2017; Themeli et al., 2013; Ueda et al., 2023; van der Stegen et al., 2022).",
        "The study of CAR-T cell manufacturing and its impact on therapeutic outcomes is inherently challenging due to the lack of perfectly controlled experiments. In the autologous cell therapy setting, each T-cell product is unique and donor-to-donor variation can be significant, especially in the context of heavily pretreated patients with prior exposure to hematologic toxicity and prior lymphotoxic therapies. Furthermore, manufacturing protocols vary from trial to trial and are often proprietary, precluding facile attribution of differences in clinical outcome to specific differences in manufacturing processes. Nevertheless, accumulating experience in the field has identified phenotypes that are correlated with durable responses to therapy, including a higher proportion of naïve and/or memory cell types (Bai et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2021), lower frequency of T cells expressing exhaustion markers (Finney et al., 2019), lower regulatory T cell (Treg) content (Good et al., 2022; Haradhvala et al., 2022), and higher overall proliferative potential (Fraietta et al., 2018a). Furthermore, clinical evidence suggests the CAR-T cell product’s phenotype also impacts the toxicity profile experienced by patients after infusion (Deng et al., 2020), highlighting the importance of manufacturing processes that can consistently yield cell products with the desirable characteristics.",
        "The manufacturing processes for several FDA-approved CAR-T cell products have been described in literature with broad similarities as well as unique features (Table 1). The overall process involves isolation of the starting cell population from the leukapheresis product, T-cell activation, genetic modification, ex vivo expansion, final product formulation, and product release testing (Fig. 1). This review aims to provide an overview of how process parameters in each key manufacturing step impact the resulting cell product and discusses next-generation manufacturing strategies with the potential to significantly alter the CAR-T cell therapy landscape in terms of therapeutic efficacy and patient access.",
        "Summary of FDA-approved CAR-T cell product manufacturing",
        "Schematic of autologous CAR-T cell manufacturing processes. Autologous CAR-T cell manufacturing generally involves initial cell isolation, T-cell activation, introduction of CAR transgene (or mRNA), cell expansion, and final formulation. Most products are cryopreserved and thawed at bedside prior to infusion into patients. Conventional manufacturing processes typically involve 1–2 wk of ex vivo cell manipulation and expansion, whereas abbreviated manufacturing processes can shorten the ex vivo period to 24–72 h. However, actual vein-to-vein time can be substantially longer due to the time required for transportation, product release testing, and clinical care considerations for the patient.",
        "The choice of starting cell population for CAR-T cell manufacturing is an early decision point with significant impact on the production process as well as the final product. Autologous CAR-T cell manufacturing processes generally begin with mature T cells either in purified form or as part of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) population. Mature T cells differentiate from the naïve (TN) phenotype into stem-cell memory (TSCM), central memory (TCM), effector memory (TEM), effector (TE), and exhausted (TEXH) cells. Furthermore, T cells can be categorized into CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ helper T cells, and CD4+ Tregs. Within the helper T cell category, one could further identify subpopulations such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and follicular helper cells. The diversity of T-cell phenotypes renders the choice of starting cell population a major process parameter in CAR-T cell manufacturing (Golubovskaya and Wu, 2016). However, biology is not the only factor influencing the choice of starting material as the patient’s clinical history and health status also impose practical constraints on the materials that can be feasibly obtained for cell manufacturing.",
        "CAR-T cells are activated directly through CAR antigen binding without the need for coreceptor binding to MHC molecules. Therefore, CAR-T cell function does not, in principle, require CD4 and CD8 molecules as coreceptors. Early developmental work on CAR-T cells contemplated the advantage of selective enrichment of CD8+ T cells to maximize cytotoxicity (Berger et al., 2008). However, CD4+ helper T cells also play a critical role in promoting CD8+ T cells’ effector function, expansion, and persistence (Kumamoto et al., 2011), and it has been shown that the presence of CD4+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment results in increased recruitment, proliferation, and function of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (Bos and Sherman, 2010). Therefore, currently approved CAR-T cell products all contain both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, although divergent manufacturing approaches are employed.",
        "Among the CD19-specific CAR-T cell products, tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel), axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), and brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel) all utilize mixed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Mian and Hill, 2021; Roberts et al., 2018; Tyagarajan et al., 2019). In contrast, lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) comprises two different cell products—made separately from CD4+ and CD8+ starting cell populations—that are admixed prior to administration (Teoh and Brown, 2022). This more complex manufacturing process is motivated by preclinical studies suggesting defined CD4:CD8 ratios may confer superior antitumor efficacy (Sommermeyer et al., 2016), although clear distinctions in efficacy and safety profiles between liso-cel and other products will require broader and longer-term data collection (Abramson et al., 2020, 2023; Locke et al., 2022; Schuster et al., 2021).",
        "Cell isolation is commonly achieved through magnetic bead–based cell sorting. A mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ cells can be isolated through the depletion of non-T cells or by positive selection using a combination of CD4− and CD8-binding microbeads. The process of isolating a mixed T-cell population is relatively streamlined and can be accomplished at lower cost compared with parallel manufacturing of separate CD4+ and CD8+ cell cultures, but it precludes the possibility of precisely controlling the CD4:CD8 ratio in the final product. Alternatively, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can be isolated and cultured separately, allowing for the formulation of a final product with precise CD4:CD8 ratios. However, this approach comes at the cost of increased labor, time, and cost of manufacturing. Furthermore, optimal CD8+ T-cell expansion requires the presence of CD4+ T cells (Castellino and Germain, 2006), rendering the manufacturing of isolated CD8+ T cells vulnerable to production failure. A potential solution to this challenge is to isolate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells separately but coculture at defined starting ratios, with the aim of generating a final cell product with approximately the desired ratio of CD4:CD8 T cells. Such a strategy has been shown to overcome the difficulty of CD8+ T-cell expansion, resulting in a product with increased cytotoxic function in mice compared to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells cultured separately (Lee et al., 2018). However, such “defined” manufacturing methods cannot completely prevent manufacturing failures. Importantly, the starting CD4:CD8 ratio needed to yield the desired final ratio in the product can vary by donor, thus a precise product profile remains challenging by this approach.",
        "Beyond CD4:CD8 ratios, the differentiation state of the T-cell product has been shown to correlate with antitumor efficacy profiles (Bai et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2021; Fraietta et al., 2018a; Haradhvala et al., 2022). Upon antigen stimulation, T cells undergo clonal expansion and a subset differentiates into TE cells, which have potent cytotoxicity and cytokine production capabilities but are relatively short-lived (Golubovskaya and Wu, 2016), in contrast, a subset of activated T cells become memory T cells that are long-lived and quickly activated in response to a secondary antigen challenge (Sallusto et al., 2004). Compared with terminally differentiated TE cells, TN, TSCM, and TCM cells possess greater potential for long-term persistence and produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines, which could together enable durable anti-tumor response while avoiding severe acute toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS; Chang et al., 2014; Farber et al., 2014; Kishton et al., 2017). Such findings have supported exploration of manufacturing processes that begin by enriching for naïve and memory T cells, with early evidence suggesting such products can achieve robust efficacy combined with a favorable safety profile (Larson et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2016).",
        "The surface expression of CD45RA, CD45RO, CD62L, and CCR7 is commonly used to identify T-cell subtypes (Golubovskaya and Wu, 2016), and naïve and memory T cells can be isolated from a leukapheresis product by selecting for CD62L+ cells (Arcangeli et al., 2022; Casati et al., 2013; Larson et al., 2023). However, CD62L+ selection can simultaneously lead to unintended enrichment of CD14+ myeloid cells and CD25+ Tregs that also express CD62L (Larson et al., 2023). Myeloid cells have been shown to significantly reduce the efficiency of T-cell activation and subsequent viral transduction, potentially due to phagocytosis of the anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic beads used to activate T cells (Künkele et al., 2019; Stroncek et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2021a). Furthermore, the presence of Tregs in the CAR-T product has been reported to correlate with poor antitumor efficacy (Beider et al., 2019; Colombo and Piconese, 2007; Haradhvala et al., 2022). These findings suggest that CAR-T products may benefit from the depletion of CD14+ and CD25+ cell types prior to the enrichment of CD62L+ cells, and the use of CD14−/CD25−/CD62L+ cells as the starting material for CAR-T cell manufacturing was evaluated in multiple clinical trials (e.g., NCT02208362 and NCT04007029).",
        "Unexpectedly, data from one trial (NCT04007029) revealed that CAR-T cell products made from starting populations that were not depleted of CD14+ and CD25+ cells prior to CD62L enrichment had similar levels of activation, transduction, expansion, and final CD3+ purity level compared with products made from CD14/CD25-depleted starting populations (Larson et al., 2023). Products made from non-CD14/CD25–depleted cells showed a clear enrichment in CD4+ T cells at the end of cell manufacturing, but no significant difference in therapeutic outcome was noted between cell products made from CD14/CD25-depleted or non-depleted starting cell populations based on the small number of patients in this phase 1 trial. Of note, the cell-manufacturing process used in this particular clinical trial utilized a polymeric nanomatrix T-cell stimulant rather than a magnetic bead–based activating reagent, and the differential phagocytic response displayed by myeloid cells against activating reagents of different sizes and rigidities may have played a key role in the behavior of the resulting cell product. We next discuss the importance of the activation step in the CAR-T cell manufacturing process.",
        "T-cell activation is critical to the success of the cell-manufacturing process as it directly impacts the efficiency of CAR transgene integration (discussed in the next section) as well as T-cell expansion during ex vivo culture. T-cell activation is most commonly achieved through the stimulation of CD3 and CD28 combined with cytokine support. CD3 signaling (signal 1) triggers T-cell activation while CD28 signaling provides the necessary costimulation (signal 2) to avoid anergy (Mescher et al., 2006). In addition, cytokine cocktails (signal 3)—most commonly IL-2, IL-7, and/or IL-15—are used to support T-cell expansion (Arcangeli et al., 2020; Künkele et al., 2019). At present, manufacturing protocols typically utilize magnetic beads or colloidal polymeric nanomatrices coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies to provide signals 1 and 2. Magnetic beads offer solid support that mimics target cells presenting peptide–MHC complexes and costimulatory ligands for T-cell engagement, and anti-CD3/CD28 beads can simultaneously serve as a T-cell isolating agent for magnetism-based cell sorting. However, magnetic beads are prone to engulfment by myeloid cells (Wang et al., 2021a), thus cell sorting using anti-CD3/CD28 beads poses the risk of enriching for CD14+ cells while reducing the amount of activating reagents available to stimulate T cells. Furthermore, a debeading step through magnetic separation is required to generate a pure CAR-T cell product prior to reinfusion. In contrast, colloidal polymeric nanomatrices appear to be less prone to elimination by myeloid cells (Larson et al., 2023) and can be removed by simple centrifugation. However, head-to-head comparisons of these reagents have not been reported to enable rigorous comparison of resulting cell products.",
        "Regardless of format, commercially available activating agents are standardized products applied at a fixed bead:cell ratio or per-volume dilution ratio. More recent developments have explored the possibility of personalized T-cell activation reagents tailored for each individual product based on the patient’s disease type. For example, utilizing mesoporous silica microrods coated with a lipid bilayer, Mooney and colleagues developed APC-mimetic scaffolds that can not only provide anti-CD3 and -CD28 signals but also enable sustained release of IL-2 (Cheung et al., 2018). The density of anti-CD3 and -CD28 antibodies can be precisely tuned to provide the optimal stimulation intensity to maximize T-cell fitness (Zhang et al., 2023). The implementation of finely tuned, highly personalized reagents would have to be balanced against practical considerations of production throughput and process robustness. Nevertheless, the emergence of “smart” materials that can be adapted to different product requirements could significantly expand the flexibility and quality of manufacturing processes.",
        "It should be noted that although T-cell activation is an indispensable step in present-day CAR-T cell manufacturing, next-generation manufacturing processes are contemplating the possibility of eliminating T-cell activation. For example, a recent report described the successful transduction of non-activated T cells by lentiviral vectors (Ghassemi et al., 2022). Next, we discuss the various methods available for CAR transgene introduction, including both viral and non-viral approaches.",
        "The method of CAR transgene delivery can significantly impact the level of CAR transgene expression as well as genotoxicity, which in turn influences the safety and efficacy of the resulting CAR-T cell product. In this section, we broadly evaluate both viral and non-viral gene-delivery methods for CAR-T cell manufacturing.",
        "Currently, all FDA-approved CAR-T cell products use lentiviral or retroviral transduction to achieve CAR transgene integration (Labbé et al., 2021; Table 1). Viral transduction benefits from relatively high integration efficiency, and T cells expressing stably integrated CAR constructs have been shown to persist for >10 yr after T-cell infusion (Melenhorst et al., 2022; Scholler et al., 2012). However, virally integrated transgenes lack insertion-site specificity, presenting a theoretical risk of insertional mutagenesis. A genome-wide profiling study compared transgene integration sites in CAR-T cell products made with γ-retroviral vectors versus lentiviral vectors, with results indicating that lentiviral vectors are more likely to integrate in the intron and intergenic regions compared with retroviruses; in contrast, retroviruses have higher frequencies of integration into promoters, untranslated regions, and exon regions, resulting in a greater impact on mRNA transcript levels (Shao et al., 2022). It is important to note that there has been no reported instance to date of viral integration resulting in oncogenic transformation of CAR-T cells (Cornetta et al., 2018; Lyon et al., 2018; Marcucci et al., 2018). On the contrary, a case study reported a patient whose response to CD19 CAR-T cell therapy appeared to correlate with the expansion of a single CAR-T cell clone whose CAR transgene was randomly inserted in the TET2 locus, thereby knocking out the only functional TET2 copy as the patient had a congenital missense mutation in the other TET2 allele (Fraietta et al., 2018b). Similarly, clonal expansion of CD22 CAR-T cells with a copy of the provirus integrated in the CBL gene locus was found to expand dramatically prior to eradication of residual disease in a patient with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL; Shah et al., 2019a). Although these cases show that random insertion may serendipitously result in positive therapeutic outcome, the risk of insertion into undesirable loci remains a motivation for exploring alternative transgene-integration strategies that could ensure site specificity.",
        "Aside from integration-site considerations, viral vectors present another potential risk in the form of replication-competent retroviruses (RCRs) and lentiviruses (RCLs). Accordingly, the FDA requires RCR/RCL detection assays for the viral vectors as well as virally transduced cell products (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, 2020). However, there has been no reported instance of RCR and RCL detected in clinical CAR-T cell products to date, and balancing the cost and potential delays caused by RCR/RCL testing with the practical benefit of such assays remains a topic of active scientific exploration (Cornetta et al., 2018; Lyon et al., 2018; Marcucci et al., 2018).",
        "Although viral transduction can in principle achieve high transduction efficiency, achieving consistent levels of transgene integration in patient cell products presents a technical challenge. Indeed, 10% or lower CAR positivity—levels set based on the premise that transduced cells will expand in vivo upon antigen exposure—is not uncommon as a minimum threshold for transduction efficiency in cell products used in clinical trials (O’Rourke et al., 2017; Stadtmauer et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2020). To minimize the risk of manufacturing failure due to poor transgene expression, manufacturing protocols can incorporate the use of transduction enhancers such as protamine sulfate, retronectin, and poloxamer (Cornetta and Anderson, 1989; Delville et al., 2018; Rajabzadeh et al., 2021). A rate-limiting step in viral transduction is the initial attachment of the viral particle to the cell membrane, a process that can be facilitated by the use of retronectin for retroviral transduction and polycations such as protamine sulfate for lentiviral transduction. Polycations serve as an electrostatic bridge that links the virus to the cell surface (Doms, 2016). However, protamine sulfate’s toxicity to T cells presents a counterweight to the benefit of increased transduction efficiency. In contrast, retronectin does not lead to T cell toxicity but its use is limited to retroviral vectors. Proprietary transduction enhancers with more favorable toxicity profiles have been developed (Delville et al., 2018), although their high costs and proprietary access can present a barrier to widespread usage.",
        "In addition to the biological properties of virus transduction, practical considerations also influence the use of viruses in CAR-T cell manufacturing. The number of certified facilities capable of producing clinical-grade virus remains limited. Consequently, the time and financial cost required for virus production can present a bottleneck in both investigational drug development and commercial CAR-T cell manufacturing, highlighting the appeal of alternative, non-viral delivery systems that may be more flexible and cost-effective (Balke-Want et al., 2023).",
        "Several different non-viral gene delivery methods have been explored in the context of CAR-T cell manufacturing, including CRISPR/Cas9, transposons, and mRNA transfection. CRISPR/Cas9 has enjoyed widespread adoption as an efficient method for genome modification, and its potential to enhance CAR-T cell therapies has not gone unnoticed (Dimitri et al., 2022). To achieve site-specific gene modification, the Cas9 nuclease is complexed with a single-guide RNA (sgRNA), identifies the target site on genomic DNA via sequence complementarity to the sgRNA, and introduces a double-stranded DNA break. Next, transgene insertion is facilitated through homologous recombination between a DNA template that encodes for the desired transgene (e.g., CAR) and the genomic cut site (Jiang and Doudna, 2017).",
        "The ability to specify the transgene-integration site opens up new possibilities in engineering T cells with desired functions. A number of extragenic “safe-harbor” sites have been computationally identified and empirically tested to support the precise genetic modification of T cells for therapeutic functions (Odak et al., 2023). In particular, it has been shown that CAR transgenes can be efficiently integrated into the TRAC locus that encodes for the endogenous TCR α chain using an adeno-associated viral vector as the homology-directed repair template (Eyquem et al., 2017). This strategy commandeers the endogenous gene regulatory mechanisms that dynamically control TCR expression levels in response to T-cell activation states, with data suggesting that the resulting CAR-T cells may be more efficacious than virally integrated CAR-T cells (Eyquem et al., 2017). In addition, non-viral CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing strategies have also been used to replace the endogenous TCR with tumor-specific TCRs, enabling the development of highly personalized T-cell therapies (Foy et al., 2023; Puig-Saus et al., 2023). As another example, the aforementioned case study involving TET2 mutations has inspired subsequent evaluation of intentional CAR transgene integration into the TET2 site as a means to enhance CAR-T cell proliferation and persistence (Jain et al., 2023). Interestingly, results showed that the benefit of TET2 disruption on in vivo antitumor efficacy varied with the specific CAR constructs expressed, echoing similar findings on CAR integration into the TRAC locus (Zah et al., 2020) and highlighting the non-trivial nature of identifying optimal integration sites for CAR transgenes.",
        "In addition to facilitating site-specific transgene integration, CRISPR/Cas9 has also been used in combination with viral integration to knock out undesirable endogenous genes while non-site-specifically integrating the transgene encoding for a tumor-targeting receptor. For example, the first FDA-approved clinical trial involving CRISPR/Cas9-edited T cells utilized a manufacturing process that knocked out PD-1 and the endogenous TCR with CRISPR/Cas9 while lentivirally integrating a transgenic TCR targeting NY-ESO-1 (Stadtmauer et al., 2020). Of note, it was observed that the frequency of NY-ESO TCR-expressing cells with mutations in the PDCD1 locus decreased over time after infusion, suggesting that PD-1–edited T cells might lack the ability to form long-term memory (Stadtmauer et al., 2020). In another phase 1 clinical study, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to knock out PD-1 and the TCR α chain while a mesothelin-targeting CAR was lentivirally integrated (Wang et al., 2021b). Although both studies showed acceptable safety profiles, neither resulted in dramatic improvements in efficacy, highlighting the need for continued improvement. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated double-stranded DNA break poses a non-trivial risk of unintended genomic changes that require careful analysis and quality control, and a recent study revealed the potential for chromosome loss in Cas9-engineered CAR-T cells (Tsuchida et al., 2023). Interestingly, the same study observed that the specific order of operations impacted the frequency of chromosome loss, which can be reduced if the Cas9-mediated double-stranded break is performed before the T cells are activated.",
        "As an alternative to CRISPR/Cas9, transposons have also been used to achieve stable CAR transgene integration into T-cell products. In particular, piggyBac and Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon systems have been evaluated in the clinical setting (Monjezi et al., 2017; Prommersberger et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). Transposon systems perform “cut-and-paste” processes in which a transposase binds to terminal inverted repeat sequences flanking a target gene element (i.e., the transposon), excises the transposon through double-stranded DNA break, and reintegrates the transposon into a suitable genomic site (e.g., palindromic sequences comprising AT dinucleotides in the case of SB transposons; Sandoval-Villegas et al., 2021; Vigdal et al., 2002). Transgene integration by this means is not site specific, and piggyBac transposases have been reported to exhibit preferential insertion into transcriptional start sites similar to retroviruses (Gogol-Döring et al., 2016), again raising the potential risk of insertional mutagenesis. In a phase 1 clinical trial, two patients treated with allogeneic CD19 CAR-T cell products generated with the piggyBac transposon system developed CAR-T cell–derived lymphoma, resulting in one fatality (Bishop et al., 2021). Post-hoc analysis indicated that the malignant CAR-T cells did not contain transgene insertion into known oncogenic sites but displayed significant copy-number gains and losses of multiple chromosomes as well as transcriptional readthrough from the transgene promoter (Micklethwaite et al., 2021). Importantly, the products that resulted in malignant transformation had unusually high vector copy numbers (VCN), with one product having a VCN of 25 (Schambach et al., 2021). By comparison, in the absence of product-specific justifications, the FDA-recommended maximum is five copies per transduced cell for virally transduced cell products (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, 2022b).",
        "One strategy to eliminate the risk of oncogenic insertion is to avoid stable integration of the CAR-encoding transgene and instead transiently express the CAR from an mRNA template (Yoon et al., 2009). In addition to eliminating the risk of genotoxicity, transient CAR expression from mRNA has also been explored as a means to reduce potential toxicity, particularly when the CAR targets an antigen that is also present in healthy tissues (Zhao et al., 2010). Transgene-encoding mRNA templates are typically delivered into T cells by electroporation, and transgene expression lasts for ∼1 wk, with expression levels declining each day after electroporation (Yoon et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2006). Therefore, the potential safety advantage of transient gene expression must be balanced against the necessarily short-lived nature of the therapy. Clinical evaluations suggest that mRNA-encoded CAR-T cells are safe and can exhibit antitumor efficacy (Beatty et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2010), but the ability to achieve complete and durable tumor control remains an area of investigation.",
        "Once T cells have been modified to express the CAR transgene, the product must be expanded to a sufficiently large number to meet the required dose for administration. The duration of this expansion period varies across different protocols, but typical processes last 1–2 wk from the time of T-cell activation to the time of cell harvest. The expansion condition is optimized for T-cell growth, with cytokine support such as IL-2, IL-7, and/or IL-15 (Arcangeli et al., 2020; Künkele et al., 2019). Although the main purpose of the expansion period is to increase T-cell numbers, it also eliminates non-T cells by exposing them to culture conditions that are suboptimal to other cell types, thus enabling the generation of a highly enriched T-cell product even if the manufacturing process begins with mixed PBMCs. In addition to cytokines, culture supplements such as FBS also play a critical role in supporting T-cell expansion, although defined media compositions that enable more precise formulation and lower risk of zoonotic pathogens are rapidly supplanting components such as FBS (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, 2022a). Finally, recent studies have explored the use of various pharmacological supplements to promote desirable T-cell phenotypes and enhance the therapeutic potential of the resulting CAR-T cell product. For example, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib has been used in CAR-T cell manufacturing to inhibit CAR tonic signaling (i.e., receptor signaling in the absence of antigen stimulation), thereby preventing premature T-cell exhaustion and increasing CAR-T cell functionality (Weber et al., 2021). This strategy was used to produce GD2-targeted CAR-T cells—which are known to strongly tonically signal and exhibit a propensity toward exhaustion (Long et al., 2015)—for a phase 1 trial, with early results showing remarkable improvements in multiple patients with H3K27M-mutated diffuse midline gliomas (Majzner et al., 2022). Since multiple doses of CAR-T cells were administered to each patient enrolled in this trial, definitive conclusions on whether dasatinib prevented exhaustion and/or enabled sustained T-cell function remain elusive. Nevertheless, this example demonstrates the feasibility of pharmacologically modulating the CAR-T cell manufacturing process to generate functional CAR-T cell products for clinical translation.",
        "Capitalizing upon the groundbreaking success of CAR-T cells in the treatment of hematological malignancies in 2017, over 1,000 active CAR-T cell clinical trials are in progress globally, concentrated in the North American and Eurasian continents (Wang et al., 2023). This boom in clinical investigations has refined our understanding of relevant parameters for successful CAR-T cell products. As with any proposed therapy, CAR-T cells seeking clinical evaluation must meet defined product characteristics relating to safety, purity, potency, identity, and stability. All FDA-approved CAR-T cell products (Havert, 2017; Liu, 2017; Price, 2020; Kwilas, 2021; Schultz, 2021; Ye, 2022) measure the bolded product characteristics below using combinations of the following metrics:•Safety: Mycoplasma, sterility, endotoxin, residual viral-agent quantification, viability, and CAR transgene quantification•Purity: T-cell purity, viability, residual reagent quantification, transduction efficiency, and presence of contaminating tumor cells•Potency: Transduction efficacy, viability, CAR expression, cytotoxicity, or cytokine (e.g., IFN-γ) production upon antigen stimulation•Identity: CAR expression, visual appearance, clarity, dose, and viability•Stability: Formulation, shipping, and storage.",
        "•Safety: Mycoplasma, sterility, endotoxin, residual viral-agent quantification, viability, and CAR transgene quantification",
        "•Purity: T-cell purity, viability, residual reagent quantification, transduction efficiency, and presence of contaminating tumor cells",
        "•Potency: Transduction efficacy, viability, CAR expression, cytotoxicity, or cytokine (e.g., IFN-γ) production upon antigen stimulation",
        "•Identity: CAR expression, visual appearance, clarity, dose, and viability",
        "•Stability: Formulation, shipping, and storage.",
        "The FDA has recently drafted standardized expectations for CAR-T cell products. In particular, lot release criteria for early-phase investigational new drug application submissions do not require validated potency assays and specifications, but such assays must be included when generating data in support of the Biologics License Application (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, 2022a; Dias et al., 2023).",
        "Based on accumulating data from ongoing clinical trials and real-world experience, additional parameters have also been proposed to propel future development of more reproducible, effective, and safe therapeutics. For instance, given evidence suggesting CAR-T products with less differentiated, more memory-like phenotypes have greater potential to achieve durable tumor clearance (Chen et al., 2021), future commercial products may benefit from setting an efficacy characteristic metric that specifies the proportion of favorable T-cell subpopulations within the product. However, altering and tightening product specifications must be guided by rigorous scientific evidence and fundamental biological understandings to avoid triggering unnecessary manufacturing failures that could curtail access to therapy for patients.",
        "In certain instances of product failure involving non-life-threatening lot release criteria (e.g., dose, transduction efficacy, cytokine production level, or CAR expression), out-of-specification products can be administered to patients upon receiving necessary regulatory approvals. Within expanded-access protocols, patients have received out-of-specification commercial and clinical-trial products and experienced comparable clinical outcomes as patients treated with standard products (Chong et al., 2019; Jacobson et al., 2020; Rossoff et al., 2020; Schultz et al., 2022). Accumulating clinical experience with CAR-T cell products in the real-world setting will be invaluable in understanding which product characteristics truly impact patient safety and therapeutic efficacy, and may serve as a guide for further refinement of regulatory guidance on CAR-T cell product release testing.",
        "The manufacturing strategies discussed thus far have supported the development of multiple CAR-T cell products to date and enabled the demonstration of CAR-T cell therapies’ potential to overcome advanced malignancies. However, real-world experiences with CAR-T cell therapy after FDA approval have also highlighted the limitations of conventional cell-manufacturing processes, which are low throughput and resource intensive, resulting in limited patient access to potentially life-saving therapies (Levine et al., 2016). As of early 2023, 90% of patients with MM experience disease progression and 25% of patients succumb to disease while waitlisted for BCMA-directed CAR-T cell product slots, with waiting periods ranging from 1 to 10 mo before undergoing apheresis (Al Hadidi et al., 2023; Kourelis et al., 2023). Upon apheresis, the cells must undergo transportation to and from the manufacturing site, ex vivo modification and expansion, and stringent quality-control testing (Al Hadidi et al., 2023; Hansen et al., 2023; San-Miguel et al., 2023). The majority of patients required bridging therapy to combat further clinical deterioration during cell manufacturing (Al Hadidi et al., 2023; San-Miguel et al., 2023), which could lead to further infusion delays in patients who experience adverse reactions related to bridging (Roddie et al., 2023; Shahid et al., 2022).",
        "Even in the absence of medical complications during the vein-to-vein time, 4–7% of patients are unable to receive their CAR-T cell products as a result of manufacturing failures (Bhaskar et al., 2021; St Martin et al., 2023), with risk factors including reduced fitness of patient T cells following multiple lines of treatment and the lengthy manufacturing process itself (Jo et al., 2023). Therapeutic options following unsuccessful product manufacturing include repeating apheresis or transitioning to alternative therapies, though survival outcomes are poor in both cases (Jagannath et al., 2021; Jo et al., 2023; Mateos et al., 2023). Altogether, the multiple sources of delays leading to loss of life underscore the criticality of timely access to CAR-T cell products (Chen et al., 2022). Here, we discuss next-generation strategies under development to address key challenges in CAR-T cell manufacturing (Table 2).",
        "Next-generation CAR-T cell manufacturing strategies",
        "In response to these challenges in CAR-T cell manufacturing, new strategies have been developed to dramatically decrease the duration of cell manufacturing, thereby reducing production costs, probability of manufacturing failures, and vein-to-vein time (Barba et al., 2022; Ghassemi et al., 2022; Sperling et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2022). These next-generation manufacturing processes can arrive at final-product formulation within as few as 24 h (Fig. 1), offering the possibility of significantly accelerating patient access to therapy. The bulk of the time-saving results from significant shortening of the ex vivo expansion period, thus limiting the fold increase in cell count that could be accomplished. However, the reduced number of ex vivo cell divisions could also result in a less differentiated T-cell population, with greater long-term proliferative potential after infusion. Indeed, early results indicate that products harvested at earlier time points exhibit greater proportions of TCM cells (CD45RO+CD62L+) and TN/TSCM cells (CD45RO−/CCR7+), which have been reported to exhibit therapeutically favorable phenotype and function (Flinn et al., 2021; Ghassemi et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2022).",
        "One example of a CAR-T cell product made with accelerated manufacturing is the CD19-directed YTB323 cells manufactured with the “T-Charge” platform, which requires <2 d in ex vivo culture. YTB323 cells have been reported to exhibit an enrichment of TN and TSCM cells, as well as a more similar CD4:CD8 ratio as that found in the apheresis material, in comparison to the equivalent product produced using the conventional CAR-T cell manufacturing process (tisa-cel; Flinn et al., 2021). Of note, preliminary results from a phase-2 trial indicate that YTB323 can yield comparable efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) as tisa-cel but at a 25-fold lower dose, suggesting the reduced ex vivo culture time may have yielded a functionally superior product (Dickinson et al., 2023). As another example, the BCMA-directed PHE885 cells manufactured with the same T-Charge platform achieved a 98% overall response rate in a phase-1 trial for patients with relapsed/refractory MM (Sperling et al., 2023). Of note, CAR-T cells were detectible at 6 mo after infusion in 93% (13/14) of patients and at 12 mo in 71% (5/7) of patients, indicating robust in vivo T-cell persistence (Sperling et al., 2023).",
        "Another accelerated manufacturing platform, termed FasT CAR-T, has been used to generate “CD19 F-CAR-T” cells for patients with B-ALL, with 92% (23/25) of patients achieving minimum residual disease-negative complete responses (Yang et al., 2022). The majority (20/25) of patients in this trial proceeded to undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, and thus the long-term durability of response to CAR-T cell therapy could not be assessed. As the clinical data from multiple trials continue to mature, the relative durability of response induced by CAR-T cell products generated through different manufacturing platforms will be a significant point of interest.",
        "A theoretical concern associated with the accelerated cell manufacturing process is that CAR-T cells cryopreserved shortly after ex vivo activation may exhibit an overly stimulated phenotype. Furthermore, particularly in the context of hematological malignancies, products from highly abbreviated manufacturing processes have increased probability of containing tumor cells that would otherwise have been depleted during a prolonged ex vivo culture period under conditions optimized for T-cell growth. However, available clinical data suggest that the safety profile of CAR-T cell products manufactured through these shortened protocols remains clinically manageable. Phase 1 study results for YTB323 in the treatment of DLBCL showed 33% (15/45) of patients experienced CRS, with one grade-4 event, and 11% (5/45) experienced immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), with two grade-3 events (Flinn et al., 2021). In patients with B-ALL, CD19 F-CAR-T cells exhibited greater toxicity, tripling the incidence of CRS (96% overall; 24% grade ≥3) and doubling ICANS (28%, all grade ≥3). Twenty-one of 25 patients required interventional corticosteroids during the CRS onset period, though treatment did not ablate peak CAR-T cell expansion (Yang et al., 2022). Additional data from ongoing clinical trials will be highly informative in establishing our understanding of the biological differences among CAR-T cell products manufactured through different platforms. Finally, it is important to note that regulatory requirements on product release testing remain applicable to products manufactured with accelerated processes, and the time required for such release testing still needs to be accounted for in estimating the vein-to-vein time.",
        "Another avenue by which commercial CAR-T cell production may be improved involves the automation of the manufacturing process, which has the potential to reduce production costs, the probability of manufacturing failures attributed to human error, and contamination via touchpoints (Aleksandrova et al., 2019; Mock et al., 2016; Trainor et al., 2023). In certain jurisdictions (e.g., the United States), some automated systems are considered fully enclosed and allowed to be operated outside facilities that meet Good Manufacturing Practice standards. Furthermore, automation could significantly reduce the number and experience level required for the manufacturing staff (Zhu et al., 2018). These factors, in turn, support the possibility of on-site manufacturing that provides fresh, non-cryopreserved products for patients. In a phase-1 trial for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, patients were given CD19/CD20 bispecific CAR-T cells that were either administered fresh or thawed from cryopreserved aliquots, with early data showing fresh CAR-T cell products had higher viability (93% fresh versus 63% cryopreserved; Shah et al., 2019b). A follow-up report on the trial confirmed that patients treated with fresh CAR-T cell products experienced substantially higher complete response rates (80% fresh versus 29% cryopreserved) as well as greater CAR-T cell expansion and persistence compared with patients treated with cryopreserved CAR-T cells (Shah et al., 2020). Although it remains possible that improvements in cell-cryopreservation procedure could reduce the difference in efficacy observed between fresh and cryopreserved CAR-T cell products, these results highlight the potential advantage of on-site cell manufacturing. However, scaling such a practice to a large number of medical centers while ensuring consistent product quality remains a key challenge. Importantly, several regulatory changes would be required to allow point-of-care CAR-T cell manufacturing, and differences among jurisdictions across the globe represent substantial hurdles in the practical implementation of on-site cell manufacturing (Elsallab and Maus, 2023). Furthermore, the use of fresh cell products precludes the completion of release testing that requires long incubation periods, necessitating reliance on in-process sample testing as well as contingency clinical management plans for scenarios in which failed sterility or other test results are received after the cell product has already been infused. In addition, the administration of fresh products poses significant logistical challenges as it requires close temporal coordination between cell manufacturing and patient readiness for receiving cell infusion. Finally, the highly standardized nature of automated systems can pose challenges when the optimal process-parameter setting needs to be adjusted on a patient-by-patient basis. For example, cells from different patients could have dramatically different expansion rates, thus the amount of media needed on each day to maintain the proper cell density in the culture could vary widely across manufacturing campaigns. To achieve the optimal outcome, instruments need to be equipped to sense critical parameters and respond accordingly.",
        "Looking further ahead, the next-next-generation manufacturing process may completely eliminate ex vivo cell manipulation and expansion, and instead produce therapeutic cell populations in vivo (Michels et al., 2022). Several preclinical studies have demonstrated the ability to transduce T cells in vivo using lentivirus or adeno-associated virus (Agarwal et al., 2020; Frank et al., 2020; Huckaby et al., 2021; Michels et al., 2023; Pfeiffer et al., 2018). Furthermore, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and polymeric nanocarriers have been shown to deliver nucleic-acid payloads to T cells in vivo (Rurik et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2017). To achieve T-cell targeting, the viral particles, LNPs, and nanocarriers are typically decorated with a single-chain variable fragment or other binding domains targeted to CD3, CD4, or CD8 (Michels et al., 2022). However, the specificity for T-cell targeting may not need to be absolute, and one could contemplate the potential advantage of simultaneously generating CAR-T cells, CAR–natural killer cells, and CAR-macrophages. Nevertheless, it remains critical that the transgene is not delivered into malignant cells, as such an integration event could result in CAR proteins masking the target antigen and shielding the tumor cell from detection by CAR-expressing effector cells (Ruella et al., 2018). Furthermore, off-target gene delivery increases the risk of genotoxicity in the case of viral vectors that can achieve stable transgene integration. In practical terms, specifically targeting the transgene-delivery vehicle to T cells and strategies to facilitate efficient transgene integration without external T-cell activation are likely necessary to generate an effective dose of CAR-T cells that can achieve durable antitumor efficacy. Finally, in-depth pharmacokinetics and safety demonstrations will be needed prior to clinical translation of in vivo CAR-T cell manufacturing platforms. Despite the many hurdles that remain, the ability to bypass ex vivo cell manufacturing has the potential to significantly reduce cost and increase access to CAR-T cell therapy for patients in need of this treatment option.",
        "CAR-T cell therapy has become an increasingly important treatment option for hematological malignancies, and clinical trials continue to expand CAR-T cell therapy’s application to the treatment of solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Consequently, CAR-T cell manufacturing processes that can efficiently and reliably produce high-quality cell products have become essential for supporting timely, safe, and efficacious patient care. Accumulating clinical experience, real-world manufacturing data collection, advancements in automated system engineering, and fundamental understanding of T-cell biology all play critical roles in the continual improvement of autologous CAR-T cell manufacturing processes. Furthermore, the rapidly evolving landscape of allogeneic cell therapy involving additional immune effector cell types as well as T cells generated from stem-cell populations will continue to be a source of both intriguing scientific questions and practical engineering challenges in the coming years.",

        "CAR-T cells are genetically modified T cells that express synthetic receptors on the cell surface to detect and eradicate cancer cells by identifying specific tumor antigens (Figure 1). Unlike T cells, CAR-T cells can recognize antigens on the surface of cancer cells without human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Therefore, CAR-T cells can distinguish a wider range of targets than natural T cells. When CAR-T cells bind to the targeted antigen, they are activated and act as “active drugs” that attack the tumor [1]. Six CAR-T cell therapies have been granted approval for hematological cancers by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2017. Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) and Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) were the first two CAR-T products to be approved for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with refractory/relapsed B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapies [2,3]. More CAR-T cell treatments were granted approval afterwards. In total, four out of six CAR-T cell products are anti-Cluster of Differentiation (CD)19 CARs, and the two newest CAR-T cell products target B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). [2,3,4,5,6,7]. Approved indications and details of each CAR-T cell product are shown in Table 1.",
        "The high response rate achieved with CAR-T treatment for the above-mentioned indications was clinically meaningful in those difficult to treat patient populations with no other alternative treatment [8]. In the past few years, CAR-T cell therapies have reached considerable success in treating such blood malignancies. However, the efficacy concern that became significant is the high relapse rate after achieving remission. Likewise, the safety concern was another problem for the patients as well as treating physicians, e.g., CRS and neurologic toxicities. Apart from the seriousness of CAR-T side effects on the patients, its management added considerably to the high cost of CAR-T therapy. The main toxicity of the treatment with CAR-T therapy is cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which includes a set of life-threatening and sometimes fatal reactions after the infusion of CAR-T. Treatment with CAR-T activates T cells, leading to the release of high levels of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, and interferon (IFN)-Υ. The key cytokine for CRS is IL-6, which is the main cause of the immune reactions of CRS such as fever, chills, headache, and malaise. Likewise, it is also responsible for many severe and potentially life-threatening symptoms such as vascular leakage syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Neurotoxicity is another safety issue that has been frequently seen in patients receiving CAR-T cells. Although the exact mechanism of neurotoxicity is less established, probable pathophysiologic reasons have been suggested: one is that elevated levels of cytokines in the central nervous system (CNS) can lead to neurotoxicity; the other is that elevated levels of cytokines increase the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), allowing CAR-T cells to penetrate and cause neurotoxicity [9].",
        "Management of CRS necessitates the proper assessment of its severity, usually using the CRS severity scale developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This is followed by general management that includes the immediate administration of tocilizumab, which is an IL-6 antagonist given with or without corticosteroids. Additionally, specific treatment addressing the body systems and organs affected by CRS should start immediately [10]. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) can affect different body systems and organs, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe, even debilitating. The proper management of CRS includes other medical specialties such as neurology, nephrology, and cardiology, in addition to a treating hematologist, all working together to address the different body systems/organs [11,12]. The treatment of severe CRS is usually done in an intensive care unit. The success of CRS treatment is dependent on the immediate implementation of the necessary measures upon the appearance of symptoms [13,14,15]. In the management of neurotoxicity, the standard treatment is corticosteroids due to the limited BBB penetration of tocilizumab [16].",
        "In addition to concerns about efficacy and safety, another question is how the barriers that limit the application of CAR-T cell therapy can be overcome. About 90% of cancers are solid tumors, but current indications for CAR-T cell therapy are limited to treating hematological malignancies. The above issues suggest that there are still various obstacles to this therapy that need to be addressed. This review will demonstrate the challenges of CAR-T cell therapy in cancer treatment and propose potential strategies to optimize CAR cell therapy. This article will also provide speculation on the future development of this therapy.",
        "The positive results of CAR-T therapy led to continued research trying to improve on the CAR-T activity while minimizing toxicity. Currently, there are four generations of CAR-T that are either developed or under development. The constitution of general CARs is demonstrated in Figure 2. The first-generation CARs were simple in their design. They only contained an activation domain (CD3ζ chains) in the intracellular region. This simple structure of CD3ζ had limited therapeutic activity. The structure can send signals leading to the activation of T cells; however, it did not support cell expansion, which is a necessary step for disease control. To overcome this issue, the second-generation CAR-T had a costimulatory signaling domain (e.g., CD28, 4-1BB, and OX40), which was added to the intracellular region resulting in a dual-signal configuration leading to significant cell expansion and improved activity [1]. The third-generation CARs (Figure 2) were developed based on the second generation. It has two costimulatory domains in addition to the activation domain CD3ζ chains in the intracellular region, thus enhancing the survival of the CAR-T cells. Subsequently, the fourth-generation CAR-T cells were developed. They are known as T cells redirected for antigen-unrestricted cytokine-initiated killing (TRUCKs). They are modified by introducing additional transgenes leading to the production of inducible cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-12). This resulted in the improvement of the cell function in addition to the modulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) [17].",
        "Patients who relapsed following CAR-T therapy fall into two main groups: antigen-positive relapse and antigen-negative relapse [11]. An antigen-positive relapse occurs when the response to CAR-T therapy is not sufficient, with a minimal effect for CAR-T cells and only transient B-cell aplasia. With flow cytometry, CD19 can be detected on the surface of the cells [18]. This type of relapse is associated with poor CAR-T cell persistence and proliferation in the human body. An antigen-negative relapse is caused by antigen escape, which may be caused by a gene mutation. For instance, the CD19-negative relapses represent up to 20% of the relapsed CAR-T cell-treated patients. With a CD19-negative relapse, CD19 is not detected on the surface of the cells [19]. This occurs due to mutations in exons 1–13 of the CD19 gene. Exons 1–4 carry the codes for the extracellular domains, and exons 5–13 carry those of the transmembrane domain [20,21]. The percentage of CD19-negative cells can be measured by flow cytometry, which is also able to assess the frequency of allelic mutations and the percentage of cells where there is a homozygous loss and biallelic mutations, which are major reasons for the loss of the targeted epitope of CD19, with the subsequent escape from the effect of anti-CD19 CAR-T [21].",
        "Relapse after initial response to CAR-T cells is still a major problem. Different strategies were developed to overcome this issue, e.g., the development of novel CAR-T designs and combinations with other therapies. Some of these strategies are summarized in Table 2.",
        "To overcome this type of relapse, ongoing research is evaluating the combination of CAR-T with other therapies such as the development of artificial antigen-presenting cells (AAPCs) and the development of CARs with novel designs. AAPCs are a technology aimed at developing a platform in which the APC provides controlled signals to stimulate the T-cell expansion and specific molecules on the T cells with a specific molecular phenotype and activity. The AAPCs can be derived using signal transduction of specific cell lines or from synthetic materials such as polystyrene coated with specific cytokines or other stimulatory molecules that will deliver the required signal to the T cells. Giving AAPCs to regularly stimulate CAR-T cells after disease remission is a novel strategy for prolonging clinical response. It is currently undergoing testing in a clinical study [22,23,24]. Additionally, research on cancer immunology has shown that the signals sent to the T cells by professional antigen-presenting cells at the time of the encounter of tumor antigen can affect the efficacy of the treatment of CAR-T cells. This has resulted in the activities aiming at developing artificial antigen-presenting cells in or to control the signals sent to the T cells when tumor antigen is encountered.",
        "Another attempt to prevent antigen-positive cells is the generation of CAR-T cells that have a truncated IL-2 receptor β-chain domain with a transcription factor, e.g., a 3/5 transcription factor and a signal transducer. These are considered fifth-generation CARs. This concept is currently in the exploratory stage; however, it has shown promising activities when tested in preclinical models of different blood and solid cancers by showing improved cell proliferation and persistence in comparison with the currently available CAR-T cells [25,26].",
        "Another approach to preventing antigen-negative relapse is combining bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) with CAR-T cell therapy. One side of a BiTE is designed to bind to CD3 and activate T cells, while the other side is directed against a tumor antigen. The combination with BiTEs allows CAR-T cells to aim at distinct antigens by altering BiTEs. This concept has been tested in preclinical models to avoid antigen escape. The combination of BiTEs and CAR-T is a bispecific antibody (BsAbs) that recruits T cells to tumor cells. Both are effective immunotherapies; they redirect T cells to a tumor-specific antigen using antibody fragments. They have shown considerable success in B-cell hematologic malignancies and are currently tested for the treatment of solid tumors [27]. A preclinical study has shown that CAR-T.BiTE, the combination of CAR-T cells with BiTEs, can eliminate tumors with a heterogeneous EGFRvIII expression in a mouse model. EGFRvIII is a specific tumor antigen of glioblastoma (GBM), while EGFR is an antigen often overexpressed in glioblastoma but also expressed in normal tissues. When the EGFRvIII mutation is lost in GBM, the wild-type EGFR is still maintained. Therefore, the CARs on T cells are designed to attack tumor cells that express EGFRvIII. Meanwhile, CAR-T cells secrete BiTEs to redirect CAR-T cells and recruit bystander T cells against wild-type EGFR. The elimination of the EGFRvIII-negative, EGFR-positive glioblastoma has been seen in a study on treatment with CART.BiTE [28].",
        "Multiantigen-specific CARs with “OR” logic gates target distinct antigens on the same T-cell surface. The design is to present bispecific CARs on a single T cell to target two different antigens expressed on the tumor. It has been tested in preclinical research and has shown positive results. For instance, multiple trials have reported patient relapses due to the appearance of CD19-negative leukemic cells. In a preclinical study, the mixed (75% CD19+/CD20+, 25% CD19−) B-cell malignancies in mice were completely cleared after receiving the CD19/CD20 OR-gate CAR-T cells and did not show signs of relapse over 109 days. However, single-input CD19 CAR-T cells can only eliminate purely wild-type (CD19+/CD20+) tumor cells but not mixed B-cell tumors [29]. An alternative to the “OR” logic gates strategy is a pooled CAR-T cell that uses two CAR-T cell lines that target more than one antigen. The engineered human T cells are activated by a signal from one antigen, while the co-stimulation signaling function is carried by a co-stimulation that is specific to the second antigen. This concept has been proven pre-clinically and is currently in the clinical phase of research [30,31,32]. Universal CAR development enables a single line of CAR-T cells to bind to several antigens by giving different adaptor molecules as ligands. This approach is aimed at overcoming the antigen escape problem without the need to manufacture additional CAR-T cells [33,34].",
        "The extent of cytokine release reflects the degree of T-cell activation, which is crucial to achieving sufficient clinical effects. Nevertheless, it is also the cause of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which includes CRS and neurotoxicity. Therefore, the strategy for preventing cytokine-related toxicity is to either diminish T-cell activity or block cytokine effects.",
        "Recently, a panel of experts that included oncologists, neurologists, cardiologists, and emergency medicine specialists reviewed the available studies for CAR-T and the irAEs developing as a result of the treatment with CAR-T. The outcome of the discussion was published as the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines for the management of irAEs in patients treated with CAR-T therapy. The guidelines are intended to support the treating physician in managing the most common irAEs occurring during treatment with CAR-T, which includes CRS, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), infections, B-cell aplasia, and cytopenia. Management of CRS was mentioned above. Other serious irAEs that can occur are neurological toxicities, which are also known as ICANS. They usually occur after four days of therapy [35]. ICANS is the second serious irAE that is not infrequent in patients treated with CAR-T cells. The patients suffer from encephalopathy with other different symptoms, e.g., behavioral changes, aphasia, fine motor impairment, and headache [36]. Severe cases might also require admission to the ICU in order to control seizures and intubating the patient if needed to avoid any damage to the airway passages. ICANS can occur with CRS or alone, and it can occur up to 1 month after the treatment with CAR-T. It can be self-limited, with symptoms resolving by 17 days, or may become severe and cause permanent neurological damage. Treatment of ICANS includes the administration of corticosteroids and supportive care. Tocilizumab is contraindicated for the treatment of neurotoxicity, as it can worsen the symptoms. As CRS can occur with ICANS and CRS necessitates the treatment of tocilizumab, in accordance with ICANS, if it is low-grade and spontaneously resolves, the treatment of CRS can start and tocilizumab can be used. If the ICANS is severe and requires active measures, then managing ICANS is the first priority, before management of the CRS [36,37].",
        "Research and clinical activity are continuously trying to improve on the outcome of treatment with CAR-T while minimizing toxicity. New concepts, combinations, and designs were made to achieve these objectives, and some of these activities include the following:",
        "Based on preclinical studies, the administration of IL-1 and catecholamines antagonists at the time of CAR-T infusion have shown a decrease in the occurrence of CRS and have minimized its severity. Ongoing clinical studies are probing this concept while also assessing the impact on efficacy [35,36]. Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase that is approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia and ALL. Mestermann et al. reported that dasatinib has a reversible inhibitory effect on lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) in the CD3ζ domain. When dasatinib was administered three hours after CAR-T therapy infusion, it markedly reduced the occurrence of death due to CRS in lymphoma mouse models. Clinical studies are ongoing to assess the ability of dasatinib to decrease CRS following the infusion of CAR-T without eradicating CAR-T cells that could decrease the efficacy of the CAR-T therapy [38,39].",
        "Engineered CAR-T cells, once infused into patients, start a chain of immunological reactions that kill the target cells. However, these reactions continue in an uncontrolled way, leading to a set of immunological toxicities leading to the development of different symptoms of CRS. The release of these inflammatory cytokines in an uncontrolled manner impacts different organs with different severities. The ON-switch CAR is a design that separates the signal domain from the costimulatory domain. The T-cell activation can occur by adding heterodimerizing small molecules that promote the assembly of two fragmented CARs. Furthermore, the extent of cell activation can be modified by the dosage of the molecules [39]. Another design to reduce toxicity is the OFF-switch CAR, which is also known as the small molecule-assisted shutoff (SMASh)-CAR. SMASh-CAR includes a degron domain in the CAR structure and enables CAR degradation when protease inhibitors are given, thus downregulating T-cell activity. Oppositely, without the administration of a protease inhibitor, protease would cut off the target site to remove degron and lead to the expression of CAR [40].",
        "CAR-T therapy is currently the most effective therapy for its approved indications, but the cellular killing ability of the cells is not restricted to cancer cells only. It can affect normal cells leading to off-target effects and different toxicities. To minimize these toxicities, a genetically encoded molecule aiming at the selective destruction of the transferred cells was developed. This is called a suicide gene. The addition of a suicide gene with CAR-T cells leads to the selective destruction of the adoptively transferred cells as well as a selective ablation of the genetically modified cells, preventing the off-target effect of CAR-T therapy and the toxicity of the therapy. There are several validated suicide genes, two of which are among the most studied in the clinical setting: herpes-simplex-thymidine-kinase (HSV-TK) and inducible-caspase-9 (iCasp9). The iCasp9 suicide gene can trigger apoptosis rapidly when exposed to dimerizing agents (AP1903), thereby leading to an irreversible termination of T cells, and the inducible HSV-TK suicide gene is activated by the administration of ganciclovir (GCV) [41]. Similarly, the strategy of suicide receptors was pursued; it depends on inducing another antigen (e.g., CD20) expression on the surface of CAR-T cells, thereby serving as a “suicide receptor” that, when anti-CD20/rituximab is infused, will bind to the receptors and eliminate CAR-T cells [39,40,42].",
        "An ideal target for CAR-T should only exist on cancer cells and be expressed at a high level. Unfortunately, most antigens are present on both tumor cells and normal cells, resulting in CAR-T cell therapy that targets antigens on both normal and cancer cells. When CAR-T cells attack antigens that coexist in some normal tissues, this is what is called “on-target, off-tumor” toxicity. In patients who received anti-CD19 CARs, an eradication of normal B cells has been observed, since the B-cell line presents CD19 on their surface. Thankfully, this negative effect was countered to some extent by the infusion of gamma globulin. However, on-target, off-tumor toxicity could lead to severe side effects such as multiorgan dysfunction and even CAR-related death under severe circumstances [43]. Some novel CARs have been developed to minimize the off-target activity by enhancing tumor specificity. To achieve this, the researchers targeted two antigens, with co-expression being specific to the tumor [30,31]. Further details are demonstrated below.",
        "In mice studies, CAR-T cells targeting tumors with ROR1 antigen following lymphodepletion resulted in lethal bone marrow failure. This is due to the targeting of ROR1 expressed on normal stromal cells. The ability to develop a CAR-T that selectively targets antigens present on tumor cells and not normal cells will improve the efficacy results but avoid severe toxicities—the so-called gated or logic-gated approach. In pre-clinical studies, synNotch receptors induced transcriptional activation in response to combinatorial target–antigen recognition. However, data from clinical studies are needed to define the applicability of different strategies in clinical practice [32].",
        "The signal domain of iCAR is originated from immune checkpoints, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). CTLA-4 and PD-1 are immunosuppressive receptors commonly found on regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) and other immune cells. When CTLA-4 and PD-1 are activated via binding to corresponding antigens, inhibitory signals will be transduced to decrease cytokine secretion and suppress immune cell activation. Consequently, when iCARs detect antigens on normal cells, they will inhibit the activation of CAR-T cells and serve as a dynamic controller to reduce on-target, off-tumor toxicity [44].",
        "The synthetic Notch (SynNotch) system is an effective method for enhancing the on-target activity of CAR-T cells by the design of dual CARs with “AND” logic gates. When the CAR on the cell surface recognizes the target antigen, it triggers transcription and synthesizes another CAR that recognizes a different antigen. In this case, CAR-T cells are activated and attack the tumor only when the dual tumor antigens are present, thereby minimizing off-target tumor activity [32]. Combination CAR, also known as split CAR, is another strategy employed to diminish off-tumor toxicity. The signaling and co-stimulatory domains are split into two CARs that recognize distinct tumor antigens. Therefore, to activate CAR-T cells, both target molecules must be present at the same time [34].",
        "Although solid tumors are the most numerous of all cancers, CAR-T cell therapy is still not applicable to solid tumors. There are several barriers to this therapy in the treatment of solid tumors, including antigen specificity/heterogeneity, poor cell trafficking, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).",
        "The lack of antigen specificity and antigen heterogeneity are important obstacles for CAR-T cells in treating solid tumors, leading to severe on-target, off-tumor toxicities, and insufficient efficacy. The ideal targets for CAR-T cells are tumor-specific antigens (TSAs), which are expressed at high levels on tumor cells, and healthy tissues would thus not be damaged. CD19, CD22, and BCMA, which are highly restricted to the B-cell lineage antibodies, are currently known to be close to TSAs. The most common on-target, off-tumor toxicity caused by CAR-T cells targeting CD19, CD22, and BCMA is profound B cell aplasia, but this could be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement therapy. Unfortunately, antigens are expressed on the surface of solid tumors, and most of the hematological malignancies are tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), which also exist on normal “bystander” cells [9]. Consequently, less tolerable or even life-threatening toxicities could be caused by CAR-T-cell therapy. Furthermore, antigen heterogeneity results in various levels of antigen expression in different tumor sites, which impede the ability of CAR-T cells to detect tumors [43].",
        "Despite the efforts of researchers, finding optimal antigens in solid tumors is not easy. The development of novel CARs may be a more feasible approach to overcoming the antigen specificity/heterogeneity barrier. Combining BiTEs with CAR-T cells could be one way to tackle the problem of antigen heterogenicity in solid tumors. As mentioned in previous paragraphs, this strategy allows CAR-T cells to recognize different antigens by altering BiTEs. It has been tested in several solid tumor models in preclinical studies and has shown positive results [45]. Some novel CARs such as the SynNotch receptor system and combination CARs, which are used to reduce on-target, off-tumor activity, can also promote antigen coverage and increase antigen selectivity in solid tumors and have demonstrated positive clinical outcomes in preclinical studies [32,38]. Universal CAR, previously mentioned in regard to overcoming antigen-negative relapse, is another way to target multiple antigens to overcome antigen heterogenicity [46].",
        "CAR-T cells can only be activated when they detect and bind to antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells. For hematological malignancies, tumor cells are blood cells in blood vessels. In the treatment of solid tumors, CAR-T cells need to penetrate the vascular endothelium and enter solid tumor neoplastic lesions. The success of trafficking mainly depends on the proper pairing between chemokines secreted by tumor cells and receptors on T cells (typically CXCR3 and CCR5). However, they are often mismatched with each other, or tumor cells produce too few CXCR3 and CCR5 ligands, hindering T-cell trafficking and infiltration [47]. One of the strategies to improve trafficking issues is regional delivery. CAR-T cells are directly injected into the tumor site. Another potential approach is to provide high concentrations of CAR-T cells by implanting biopolymer devices in neoplastic tissues. Some novel CARs have been designed to overcome ineffective trafficking as well. CAR-T cells can be engineered to express tumor-associated chemokine receptors to bind to corresponding chemokine ligands and improve T-cell migration. In preclinical studies, this approach has successfully attracted CAR-T cells to the melanoma site. The development of FAP-specific CAR-T cells may be an approach to overcome the physical barriers. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) compose up to 90% of the tumor extracellular matrix, and they produce high levels of fibroblast activation protein (FAP). Therefore, the design of FAP-specific CAR-T cells could be a feasible strategy to improve cell penetration [48]. Cell infiltration can also be increased by engineering CAR-T cells to generate enzymes (e.g., heparinase) for degrading and modifying the extracellular matrix [49]. However, the efficacy and toxicity of these strategies are undetermined, and further investigation is needed.",
        "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a unique environment created by tumor cells in which low pH, hypoxia, and nutrient deficiency are observed. Moreover, TME tends to have more inhibitory soluble cytokines, inhibitory immune cells, and inhibitory immune checkpoints (e.g., PD-1 and CTLA-1) than normal tissues, hindering T-cell activity [47,50,51]. To decrease the amount of suppressive immune cells, using a blocking antibody is one of the strategies employed to remodel the TME. However, preconditioning chemotherapy may not be the most ideal way to achieve this since it will also suppress T-cell activity. A better strategy is to use an antibody that only targets immunosuppressive cells, such as the anti-regulatory T cell (Tregs) antibody and the anti-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) antibody [52,53]. Likewise, a blocking antibody can also be used to lower the level of inhibitory cytokines, especially primary ones in the TME, such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). An alternative option is to knock out the TGF-β receptor on T cells via gene editing [54].",
        "Immune checkpoints are safe regulators of the immune system, preventing an overly strong immune response from damaging normal cells in the body. However, some tumor cells can upregulate the number of immune checkpoints on T cells and stimulate them to constrain T lymphocyte activity by secreting their ligands. Therefore, the combination of CAR-T cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may be a strategy to enhance T cell-mediated toxicity. Currently, there are several ICIs available on the market, such as CTLA-4 inhibitors and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors [55]. An alternative strategy is to knockout PD-1 expression of CAR-T cells by gene modification. Other novel CAR designs such as armored CAR-T cells and the fourth-generation CAR-T cells (TRUCKs) are genetically engineered CARs to produce cytokines, which can stimulate an immune reaction and modulate the TME. Intrinsic resistance to Tregs was seen in a mouse model after infusing “armored CAR-T cells,” which secreted IL-12, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that can activate immune cells [56]. Fourth-generation CARs differ from armored CAR-T cells in that they are more flexible in design. They begin to synthesize stimulatory cytokines only when the target antigen is detected. Fourth-generation CARs have been tested in preclinical models of various solid tumors and have shown remarkable efficacy [57].",
        "CAR-T therapy was assessed for the treatment of different solid tumor types, e.g., colorectal cancer (CRC), breast cancer (BC), thoracic tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and ovarian cancer. This review will focus on four of the common tumor types and the trial of CAR-T therapy in its management. In CEA-positive CRC: a CAR-T was specifically developed for the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is a tumor marker expressed in the majority of CRC. Currently, there are several ongoing Phase I studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of CEA-directed CAR-T therapy in advanced CRC. The results of these studies are still awaited. Minimal data come from a case report of a patient with CRC who had a complete metabolic response within the liver lasting for 13 months, and preliminary results of a phase I study show that, out of 15 patients with unresectable metastatic CRC who received CAR-T therapy, there were 2 partial responses, and 9 achieved stable disease [58]. In a phase 1 trial, prostatic cancer patients were treated with lymphodepletive chemotherapy, which was followed by CAR-T therapy, received as a continuous infusion with an escalating dosage. The treatment was tolerable, and 2 out of 5 patients (40%) achieved Partial Remission (PR) and a Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) decline of 50–70%. Another patient showed a minor response to treatment [59].",
        "In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a CAR-T was developed against a potential antigen target, i.e., glypican-3 (GPC3). In two phase I studies assessing the effect of CAR-T therapy on GPC3+ HCC, patients were given an infusion of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine-based lymphodepletion. There were 13 patients enrolled in the study, with 9 of the 13 patients (69%) suffering from CRS. There were no grade 3/4 neurotoxicities. The Overall Survival (OS) was 50.3% at 6 months, 42% at 1 year, and 10.5% at 3 years. Of note, one patient from the study maintained stable disease and survived for 44 months. In another phase I study, patients with advanced metastatic solid tumors were treated with CD133 targeting CAR-T. The study enrolled patients with different solid tumors, among whom were 23 patients with HCC. Three patients achieved PR (13%), and 14 patients achieved stable disease (SD) (61%). The median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) was 5 months, and the 3-month disease control was 65% [59,60]. For the treatment of thoracic cancer, a wide variety of targets, including EGFR, HER2, MSLN, MUC1, CEA, ROR1, and PD-L1, are currently being evaluated for CAR-T cell therapy in lung cancer. Among these, EGFR- and MSLN-specific CAR-T cells seem to be more promising than the others due to the antigen’s higher specificity and lower on-target, off-tumor toxicity concerns.",
        "An open-label phase I investigated the use of regionally delivered autologous mesothelin-targeted CAR-T with pembrolizumab for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Pembrolizumab was given based on pre-clinical work that has shown that the PD-1 blockade can enhance mesothelin CAR-T activity and rescue the function of exhausted CAR-T cells [61]. In this study, 27 patients with malignant pleural disease (either as primary or pleural metastases) received intrapleural mesothelin targeting CAR-T; 25 of these patients had a diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), and 18 of them received pembrolizumab after CAR-T cell therapy. The median overall results were based on 23 out of the 27 patients in the intrapleural mesothelin targeting CAR-T and then the 18 patients who received both pembrolizumab and CAR-T therapy. At a median follow-up of 20 months, the CAR-T treatment median OS was 17.7 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 74%. Pembrolizumab was given every 3 weeks to promote CAR-T function. With the addition of pembrolizumab, the patients’ results were further enhanced with a median OS of 23.9 months, and a 1 year-survival rate of 83% [62,63,64].",
        "Autologous CAR-T cells have shown remarkable clinical outcomes and have dramatically changed the treatment of blood cancers. However, there are still issues that prevent patients from receiving CAR-T cell therapy. In addition to the efficacy and safety issues of CAR-T therapy mentioned in the previous sections, the high cost, complex process, and rather long waiting time of around 3 weeks needed for manufacturing personalized T cells are also factors that hinder patients’ access to treatment [65]. Consequently, to overcome these obstacles, the development of universal allogeneic CAR-T cells (also known as “off-the-shelf” CAR-T cells) and other CARs using alternative effector cells are underway.",
        "Compared to autologous CAR-T cells, off-the-shelf CARs have numerous potential benefits. Firstly, healthy donors can be selected and used as a source of immune cells to generate them. This could lead to a better performance of CAR-T cells since the immune cells from healthy donors have not been impacted by cancer effects or by exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. Some clinical and preclinical research has shown that the efficacy of CAR therapy is affected by the quality and quantity of T cells retrieved from patients [66]. Furthermore, patients who have received chemotherapy before the infusion are more likely to have poor-quality T cells, as well as an insufficient numbers of them, than those who have not, and this could be related to poor CAR-T-cell activity and failing to harvest enough cells for CAR-T manufacturing [67]. Secondly, unlike the time-consuming process of producing personalized autologous CAR-T cells, large numbers of allogeneic CAR-T cells can be generated from a single donor, producing batches of preserved CAR-T products that can provide patients with immediate access to treatment.",
        "In addition, the price of CAR-T therapy can be significantly reduced through large-scale production processes [65]. Nevertheless, it is concerning that, if the immune cells are originated from MHC-mismatched donors, off-the-shelf CAR-T products could result in graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which could be life-threatening. GVHD is a disadvantageous immune reaction that happens upon administration to allogeneic CAR-T cells, and it is due to a “non-self” recognition by the host immune system. Moreover, GVHD could lead to the decreased antitumor activity of allogeneic CAR-T cells, since they could be eliminated by host immune cells. Several different sources of T cells for allogeneic approaches have been tested in preclinical and clinical studies to overcome GVHD, such as virus-specific T cells, gene-modified conventional T cells, and non-conventional T cells [68].",
        "The use of virus-specific T cells may be a potential way of reducing the risk of GVHD, as they have long been used to treat viral infections after transplantation [69]. The safety of this approach has been shown in a phase I trial in which there were no reports of severe GVHD in patients with B-cell cancer who were given CAR virus-specific T cells [70]. T-cell receptors (TCRs) are primarily responsible for the recognition of MHC molecules between foreign substances and host cells. Therefore, the use of genetic modification to remove endogenous molecules such as αβ TCR and MHC is another potential strategy to overcome the problems of GVHD and rejection. In a clinical study, two infants with R/R ALL were successfully treated with universal CAR-T cells generated by transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) gene engineering [71]. The introduction of CARs into various T-cell subtypes is currently under investigation. Gamma delta T cells (γδ T cells), which account for around 5–10% of the T-cell population, are one of the most promising candidates for off-the-shelf CAR production, as γδ TCR expressed on the surface of γδ T cell is MHC-independent, thereby reducing the risk of GVHD [72]. In addition, the promises of CAR-γδT cells in treating solid tumors have been demonstrated in a proof-of-concept study, where additional antitumor activity was seen in CAR-γδT cells, while the intrinsic γδT function still exists [73].",
        "Despite the great success of CAR-T therapy in hematological malignancies, its toxicity and the other limitations mentioned above have significantly hindered patient access and its expansion in solid tumor treatment. Given these deficiencies, there is growing interest and substantial research into finding alternative effector cells for CAR cell therapy. NK cells and macrophages are two promising candidates for the manufacture of next-generation CARs because of their favorable properties. Unlike T cells, they are members of the innate immune system that can directly identify target cells without MHC and do not cause GVHD. Therefore, they are also possible options for producing off-the-shelf CARs.",
        "NK cells have several advantages over CAR-T cells, one of which is that they can recognize tumor cells even when MHC molecules are downregulated and allow them to avoid antigen escape [74]. Furthermore, NK cells can be extracted from various allogeneic sources, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or umbilical cord blood, as NK cell activation does not need to go through the MHC pathway. The antitumor activity of CAR-NKs has been demonstrated in preclinical models of various hematological and solid tumors [75]. Moreover, in a phase I/II clinical study enrolling 11 patients with CD-19-positive hematological malignancies, no significant toxicity was reported after the administration of allogeneic CAR-NK cells [15]. CAR-NK-based clinical studies that have been registered on clinicaltrials.gov and are active or recruiting are demonstrated in Table 3 [76].",
        "Macrophages represent another promising candidate that has unique features. First, they can attack tumor cells via selective phagocytosis and present antigens to T cells for adaptive immunity activation. Second, macrophages are the amplest and most highly infiltrated innate cells in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, they can generate chemokines or cytokines and thus serve as major immunomodulators to remodel the suppressive tumor microenvironment [75]. In preclinical studies, CAR macrophages successfully destroyed cancer cells in vitro and reduced tumor burden in mouse models with two different solid tumors, resulting in improved OS. Other research showed that CAR macrophages promoted the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced T-cell cytotoxic activity against tumors [77]. Notably, a CAR-M-based phase I clinical study has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov and has started recruiting (Table 4) [78].",
        "More research has been devoted to developing such therapies due to their excellent clinical results. However, CD19 remains the most popular target antigen since Kymriah was approved as the first anti-CD19 CAR product in 2017. Even though the expression patterns of a few targets, such as CD20, CD22 and BCMA, are similar to that of CD19, they have not been used as successful as CD19. One probable reason is that CD19 expression is more stable than others, leading to the stronger antitumor activity of anti-CD19 CAR in clinical implementation [79]. The recent approval of the first non-CD19-directed CAR Abecma in 2021 highlights the difficulty of finding ideal targets for CAR-T cell therapy. Encouragingly, the second non-CD19-directed CAR Carvykti was then approved in the following year. Abecma and Carvykti are both anti-BCMA CAR-T cells.",
        "CAR-T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of several blood cancers that once had no appropriate treatment options. However, given this urgent unmet medical need, the approval of CAR-T cell therapy was based on a considerably short study duration, weaker primary endpoints, and a limited number of patients compared to traditional oncology trials. CAR-T cell products currently on the market are conducted in phase I/II or phase II trials with open-label and single-arm experimental designs. Therefore, some drawbacks of the design have been noted. First, these trials had less than 1000 subjects and a follow-up duration shorter than two years. Next, the primary endpoint of most studies is the Overall Response Rate (ORR), the Complete Response (CR) rate, or the Duration of Remission (DOR), rather than a more robust endpoint such as OS or PFS. Last, the single-arm design had no control group to assess how much preconditioning chemotherapy affected patients prior to CAR-T cell infusion or how much of the antitumor response was attributable to CAR-T cell therapy. Accordingly, larger studies with time to event endpoints and a sufficient patient follow-up duration is needed.",
        "CRS and neurologic toxicity are potentially life-threatening serious AEs and greatly restrict CAR-T cell therapy. Both remain unpredictable due to a deficient understanding of the exact mechanisms of causality. It is thought that a more informative preclinical model needs to be developed to better understand these toxicities. Moreover, each investigational site has its own grading tool and treatment guidelines for these toxicities, making data collection and safety evaluation difficult. Excitingly, ASTCT Consensus Grading was published in 2018 as a consensus grading system for CRS and neurotoxicity associated with immune effector cells [80].",
        "It is encouraging that new CAR designs are being developed to overcome the above challenges, and some of these designs have shown positive results in preclinical or clinical studies. Dual CARs with AND gates are a promising strategy to expand antigen coverage, while dual CARs with NOT gates can reduce toxicity by acting as controllers of CAR-T cell antitumor activity. With the capability of secreting immune-modulating molecules, some innovative CARs can increase T-cell function and adjust the TME to restore T-cell antitumor activity. However, more time is needed to properly assess the efficacy and safety of these new CAR-T designs.",
        "The notable outcomes of CAR-T cell therapy were considered a clinical success; however, on the commercial side, CAR-T therapy has achieved minimal success. The cost of CAR-T cell therapy is a significant barrier to patient access due to the complicated, highly personalized, and time-consuming manufacturing procedure. For example, for a single infusion, Kymriah costs $475,000, and Yescarta costs $373,000, excluding hospitalization for treatment side effects [81]. Such a high price is a financial burden on both individuals and the healthcare system and limits the access of CAR-T to patients who need it.",
        "Although the development of CAR-T cell therapy still faces many challenges and obstacles, the continuous increase in the number of registered clinical studies indicates that the field is flourishing. New designs of CAR-T cells and novel CARs such as CAR-NK and CAR-M have shown potential for the treatment of solid tumors. The unique properties of CAR-NK and CAR-M also make them promising candidates for the development of off-the-shelf CAR products. Therefore, it is believed that CAR-based cell therapy will continue to be developed and optimized through emerging research and will benefit more cancer patients in the future.",
        "CAR-T cell therapy has shown excellent clinical outcomes and has significantly transformed the treatment of various R/R hematological malignancies that previously have not had many treatment options. However, high treatment prices impose a substantial burden on patients and payers, thus hindering its commercial success. Furthermore, a high relapse rate, tumor antigen escape, and severe CAR-related toxicities are unresolved concerns. Nonetheless, the continuous development of CAR technology, novel CAR development and next-generation CARs, such as CAR-NKs and CAR-Ms, and CAR-based immunotherapy all have the potential to overcome the present restrictions and achieve a safer, more effective, and broader application in cancer treatment. Likewise, it is important that CAR-T therapy is affordable so that more patients can have access to it. This will help to increase our knowledge of the efficacy and safety of CAR-T therapy in practice.",

      "abstract": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy represents a transformative breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy by harnessing the adaptive immune system to selectively eradicate cancer cells. Pioneering advances in the treatment of hematological malignancies have led to the FDA approval of several CAR-T cell therapies, particularly for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. This success is a result of continuous refinements in CAR architecture, which have evolved from early prototypes with limited therapeutic efficacy to advanced next-generation receptors that incorporate co-stimulatory domains, cytokine signaling, safety switches, and precision control mechanisms. This review elucidates the fundamental rationale behind CAR-T cell development and addresses key biological challenges encountered. Advances in receptor engineering, metabolic reprogramming, and optimized immune signaling have markedly enhanced the persistence, antitumor activity, and safety profiles of CAR-T cells. Additionally, emerging genetic engineering tools, including CRISPR, base editing, prime editing, and RNA and epigenome editing, hold promise for reducing immunogenicity and minimizing the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, CAR-T cell therapy continues to face several challenges, including severe side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, inconsistent therapeutic responses, and high production costs. To overcome these barriers, novel approaches are under development that include generating CAR-T cells in vivo , utilizing logic-gated CAR systems, and expanding CAR platforms to include other immune effector cells, such as natural killer cells (CAR-NK) and macrophages (CAR-M). The future of CAR-based therapies is expected to integrate synthetic biology, immune checkpoint modulation, and innovative delivery methods to enhance both therapeutic efficacy and safety. This review synthesizes current knowledge and emerging strategies to guide future advancements aimed at expanding the applicability of CAR therapy to various cancer types and potentially other diseases.",

        "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy represents a transformative breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy by harnessing the adaptive immune system to selectively eradicate cancer cells. Pioneering advances in the treatment of hematological malignancies have led to the FDA approval of several CAR-T cell therapies, particularly for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. This success is a result of continuous refinements in CAR architecture, which have evolved from early prototypes with limited therapeutic efficacy to advanced next-generation receptors that incorporate co-stimulatory domains, cytokine signaling, safety switches, and precision control mechanisms. This review elucidates the fundamental rationale behind CAR-T cell development and addresses key biological challenges encountered. Advances in receptor engineering, metabolic reprogramming, and optimized immune signaling have markedly enhanced the persistence, antitumor activity, and safety profiles of CAR-T cells. Additionally, emerging genetic engineering tools, including CRISPR, base editing, prime editing, and RNA and epigenome editing, hold promise for reducing immunogenicity and minimizing the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, CAR-T cell therapy continues to face several challenges, including severe side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, inconsistent therapeutic responses, and high production costs. To overcome these barriers, novel approaches are under development that include generating CAR-T cells in vivo, utilizing logic-gated CAR systems, and expanding CAR platforms to include other immune effector cells, such as natural killer cells (CAR-NK) and macrophages (CAR-M). The future of CAR-based therapies is expected to integrate synthetic biology, immune checkpoint modulation, and innovative delivery methods to enhance both therapeutic efficacy and safety. This review synthesizes current knowledge and emerging strategies to guide future advancements aimed at expanding the applicability of CAR therapy to various cancer types and potentially other diseases.",
        "Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a groundbreaking approach in cancer treatment, harnessing the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. Unlike conventional cancer treatments that directly kill cancer cells while also damaging some healthy cells, such as chemotherapy and radiation, immunotherapy leverages the body’s natural defenses to selectively recognize and eliminate cancer cells. Different immunotherapy strategies have been developed to enhance antitumor immunity, including monoclonal antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines, cancer vaccines, and adoptive cell therapy (ACT) (1). Among the various types of ACT, CAR-T cell therapy stands out as a promising immunotherapeutic approach, offering new hope for patients with refractory or relapsed hematological malignancies. CARs are synthetic receptors designed to redirect the specificity of, most commonly, T cells toward a specific target antigen in an HLA-independent manner. This approach involves isolating the patient’s immune cells and redirecting their specificity using genetic engineering methods (2, 3). Although CAR-T cell therapy has shown a remarkable success rate in hematological cancers, particularly B cell malignancies, where many patients have achieved long-term remission, its clinical efficacy against solid tumors remains elusive (4). CAR-T cell therapy, however, has its challenges. One of the most critical considerations is managing side effects, including CRS and neurotoxicity, which can be severe (5). Despite these challenges, ongoing research and innovations continue to improve the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cell therapies (6). Multiple generations of CAR-T cells have been developed to redirect T cell specificity and enhance their fitness. The growing interest in developing CAR-T cells as a versatile and powerful medical tool has highlighted their potential not just for treating cancers but also for other diseases, including autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and transplant rejection (7, 8). This article will explore the motivation behind CAR-T cell development and the evolution of its design from early generations to the latest advancements. It will address the clinical successes that led to FDA approvals and discuss innovations in next-generation CARs, including gene editing strategies and in vivo CAR-T cell approaches. Additionally, it will address key challenges related to safety and efficacy, focusing on strategies for managing side effects, optimizing CAR design, and incorporating safety switches. Finally, this article will extend the discussion beyond T cell-based therapies, highlighting the potential of CAR-engineered natural killer (CAR-NK) cells and macrophages (CAR-M) in the future of adoptive cell therapy.",
        "Several key motivations drive the development of CAR-T cell therapy: 1) overcoming the limitations of conventional cancer treatments by harnessing the immune system’s ability to target and eliminate cancer cells, 2) addressing tumor heterogeneity, and 3) generating a durable therapeutic response to reduce relapse rates (9). The concept of CAR-T cells was first proposed in 1987, suggesting that chimeric receptors can induce T cell activation in response to antigens (10). Two years later, a similar approach was reported involving a chimeric T cell receptor (cTCR) that can redirect the specificity of T cells in an MHC-independent manner. In 1993, the first generation of CARs was developed; these CAR constructs consisted of an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) fused to a single intracellular T cell receptor (TCR) signaling domain, most often CD3ζ, or in some early studies, the Fc receptor gamma chain (FcγR) (\nFigure 1\n) (11, 12). These early CARs were designed to utilize T cell cytotoxic effects with antibody-like specificity. Despite the promising in vitro results, the first-generation (1G) CARs did not demonstrate clinical efficacy in early trials, primarily due to the lack of co-stimulatory molecules, which led to limited persistence and expansion in vivo (11, 13). Over time, second-generation (2G) CARs have emerged, featuring an optimized basic construct that incorporates an additional co-stimulatory domain, such as CD28 or 4-1BB/CD137, along with the TCR signaling domain, the CD3ζ chain (\nFigure 2A\n). The addition of co-stimulatory domains addressed the limitations of the 1G CARs and significantly enhanced T cell activity, persistence, and in vivo antitumor efficacy. However, CAR-T cells expressing CD28 or 4-1BB co-stimulatory domains show differences in their persistence and functional characteristics (14, 15). A key breakthrough in the clinical success of CAR-T cell therapy was achieved in 2011 when Dr. Carl June and his team demonstrated clinical responses in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who received 2G CAR-T cells targeting CD19 (16, 17). The notable success of CD19-redirected CAR-T cell therapy in treating B cell malignancies resulted in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2017 of the first two CAR-T cell therapies, including Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) and Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel). Kymriah was developed by Novartis (International AG) to treat pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), whereas Yescarta was developed by Kite Pharma (Gilead Sciences Inc.) to treat adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma (4, 18). Thereafter, more CD19-redirected CAR-T cell therapies were also approved by the FDA, including Tecartus (brexucabtagene autoleucel), Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel), Carvykti (ciltacabtagene, autoleucel), and Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) (9, 19). \nFigure 1\n illustrates the timeline of key milestones in CAR-based immunotherapy development.",

        "Structures of different generations of CAR. The figure depicts the structure of the five generations of CAR-T cells. (A) Early-generation CARs. (B) Next-generation CARs. Created with BioRender.",
        "The first-generation (1G) CARs, consisting of a scFv fused to CD3ζ or FcγR, showed promising results in early preclinical trials. The adoptive transfer of ERBB2-specific CAR-T cells, which contain a scFv fused to the CD3ζ signaling domain, in BALB/c nude mice demonstrated their ability to recognize and infiltrate ERBB2-expressing tumor cells while slowing tumor growth (20). Similarly, studies have shown that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can be engineered to express a CAR targeting the MOv gamma (MOvγ) antigen. This is achieved using a scFv derived from the MOv18 monoclonal antibody, which specifically binds to folate receptor alpha (FRα), a tumor-associated antigen overexpressed in many ovarian carcinoma cells. The MOvγ-specific CAR incorporates an FcγR signaling domain that can trigger functional responses upon recognition of the MOvγ antigen both in vitro and in murine models. In these in vivo experiments, mice received exogenous IL-2 following the transfer of engineered T cells (20, 21). These findings demonstrate the ability to redirect T cell specificity and effector functions toward a target surface antigen. However, translating this approach into clinical success was challenging, primarily due to the absence of co-stimulatory signaling domains in the 1G CARs. Unlike natural TCRs, which require co-stimulatory signals for full T cell activation and sustained function, 1G CAR-T cells exhibited poor in vivo persistence and failed to maintain a long-term antitumor response, resulting in reduced therapeutic efficacy (9, 22). Moreover, early clinical trials highlighted the risk of severe side effects, such as CRS, demanding adjustments to CAR design and safety mechanisms (17, 23).",
        "The development of 1G CARs was a pioneering step in cancer immunotherapy. Despite several limitations, the lessons learned from these early designs were important in understanding the potential of targeting CARs against tumor antigens and guiding the development of more advanced generations of CARs. Ongoing advancements continue to enhance the clinical efficacy and safety of CAR-T cell therapy, bringing new hope to patients, especially those with resistant disease.",
        "To address the lack of co-stimulatory signals in 1G CARs, 2G CARs were engineered to include a co-stimulatory signaling domain in addition to CD3ζ (\nFigure 2A\n). This design is based on the fact that T cells require two main signals to be fully activated: 1) antigen recognition, which occurs when the TCR expressed on T cells binds to a peptide/MHC complex presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and 2) a co-stimulatory signal, which is provided by the trans interaction between the co-stimulatory receptors, such as CD28 on T cells, with their corresponding ligands, CD80/CD86, on APCs (24). As a result, one of the most significant advances in 2G CARs is the incorporation of a signaling domain capable of providing both activation and the necessary co-stimulatory signals in cis within the same receptor (25). CD28 and 4-1BB/CD137 are the most commonly used co-stimulatory domains in 2G CARs; delivering these secondary signals is critical for promoting T cell survival, proliferation, and cytokine production, thereby enhancing the antitumor efficacy of CAR-T cells (26). However, the type of co-stimulatory domain, whether CD28 or 4-1BB, has been shown to differ in several key aspects, leading to distinct functional outcomes of CAR-T cell therapy (27). CAR-T cells with CD28 co-stimulatory signals, referred to as CD28ζ CAR-T cells, undergo metabolic reprogramming predominantly toward aerobic glycolysis, leading to the early dominance of effector T cells and the development of effector memory (14). It has been observed that infusing CD28ζ CAR-T cells promotes rapid accumulation of T cells and cytokine release. This results in potent immune responses against tumor cells, which is particularly beneficial in rapidly growing cancers. However, in clinical settings, this has been associated with reduced CAR-T cell persistence and a higher incidence of CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) compared to 4-1BB-based CARs (5). Incorporating the 4-1BB co-stimulatory signaling domain in CAR-T cell products has demonstrated metabolic reprogramming of T cells toward oxidative phosphorylation, promoting the development of central memory T cells, which is crucial for long-term immunity. 4-1BB signaling has also been associated with increased mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as improved CAR-T cell survival and persistence, which is consistent with clinical observations (14). Furthermore, 4-1BB signaling promotes a more regulated and gradual activation, which may help alleviate exhaustion and reduce the severity of CRS compared to CD28-based CARs (26, 28). Although clinical trials in ALL patients treated with CD28- or 4-1BB-co-stimulated CD19-specific CAR-T cells revealed comparable initial response rates, CAR-T cells with 4-1BB co-stimulatory domains appear to outperform those with CD28 in terms of clinical efficacy in CLL trials (29, 30).",
        "2G CARs have demonstrated remarkable success in clinical studies, marking a significant step forward in the progress of CAR-T cell therapy, particularly for hematological malignancies. The clinical success of 2G CARs has been primarily driven by their ability to target CD19, a surface antigen expressed on the majority of B cell malignancies. This specificity has enabled CAR-T cells to effectively eradicate malignant B cells; however, it also results in the depletion of healthy mature B cells due to their shared CD19 expression (17). Landmark clinical trials using CD19-targeted CAR-T cells for B cell malignancies, such as ALL and CLL, have shown favorable outcomes, with many patients achieving complete remission (CR). In 2017, the FDA approved the first CAR-T cell therapies, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) and Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), respectively. These therapies have resulted in high response rates and durable remissions in patients with refractory or relapsed (r/r) ALL (\nTable 1\n) (4).",

        "Brand (tradename) is shown in bold; generic name is shown in parentheses.",
        "Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), an autologous CD19-targeted CAR-T cell product, was the first CAR-T cell therapy approved by the FDA. This approval followed a Phase 2 multicenter study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of this treatment in pediatric and young adult patients (up to 25 years old) with r/r B-ALL. This trial revealed an 81% overall remission rate with long-term CAR-T cell persistence following a single infusion, despite the occurrence of reversible high-grade toxic effects such as CRS and neurologic events; all responders tested negative for minimal residual disease (MRD) (18). This was an extension of the primary clinical trial called ELIANA (NCT02435849), the first Novartis-sponsored global CAR-T cell therapy registration trial. In 2018, it was approved for adult patients with r/r large B cell lymphoma who had failed at least two lines of systemic treatment, including DLBCL. This approval was based on the pivotal clinical trial called JULIET, which demonstrated an overall response rate of 52%, with CR achieved in 40% of patients with r/r DLBCL (31).",
        "Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), an autologous CD19-targeted CAR T-cell product, was the second CAR-T cell therapy approved by the FDA in 2017 for treating patients with r/r B cell lymphoma who had failed at least two rounds of systemic chemotherapy. Yescarta was initially approved based on a Phase 1/2 clinical trial called ZUMA-1, which involved patients with DLBCL, with a minority having primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma (PMLBCL) (32). This study found that 50% of the treated patients survived overall, and 41% remained progression-free for up to two years. Following this, a Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Yescarta as a second-line treatment for patients with large B-cell lymphoma who did not respond to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or experienced a disease relapse within 12 months of their initial treatment (33). Yescarta offered an important new therapeutic option for patients with limited treatment options whose cancers had not responded to multiple lines of treatment, such as those with DLBCL, PMLBCL, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma (FL).",
        "Following the FDA’s initial approvals of CAR-T cell therapies in 2017, including Kymriah and Yescarta, several other CAR-T cell products have also received regulatory approval. \nTable 1\n outlines all FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapies based on the 2G CAR structure.",
        "Although the introduction of co-stimulatory domains, such as CD28 or 4-1BB, into 2G CARs improved CAR-T cell activation and persistence, there is still room for improvement in terms of efficacy, response durability, and side effect management. As previously mentioned, co-stimulatory molecules have distinctive features that can be utilized synergistically to enhance the performance of CAR-T cells. Third-generation (3G) CAR-T cells were developed to further improve the therapeutic potential of CARs. Instead of a single domain as in 2G CARs, 3G CARs incorporate two co-stimulatory domains, such as CD28 and 4-1BB/CD137 or OX40, into the same construct (\nFigure 2B\n) (34). This dual co-stimulatory design leverages the complementary signaling pathways of each molecule, aiming to boost T cell activation, persistence, and antitumor efficacy while also reducing immune exhaustion and improving safety profiles. Early studies suggest that 3G CAR-T cells may have greater potency and durability compared to their 2G counterparts, yet further clinical validation is needed (34). Clinical evaluation of 3G CAR-T cells has provided important insights into their therapeutic potential. A side-by-side comparison study of 2G and 3G CARs was conducted to assess their in vivo behavior and therapeutic efficacy in patients with r/r B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) using CD19-specific CAR-T cells. In this study, the 2G CAR construct utilized CD28 as a co-stimulatory domain, whereas the 3G CAR construct included both CD28 and 4-1BB co-stimulatory domains. In the Phase 1 cohort of this ongoing SAGAN clinical trial (NCT01853631), 16 patients (11 with active disease and 5 with no measurable disease) received simultaneous infusions of both products. The 3G CD19 CAR-T cells exhibited superior expansion and persistence in vivo compared to their 2G counterparts, yielding clinical responses in 6/11 patients with active disease (3 CRs and 3 partial responses (PRs)). Additionally, 4/5 patients who were already in remission experienced durable and continued CR (35). The 3G CARs have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in patients with no measurable disease, particularly those in remission following autologous stem cell transplantation, indicating a potential benefit in preventing relapse when the disease burden is low. Despite these encouraging findings, the absence of antigen spreading observed in some patients may limit the durability of responses (defined as the duration from the onset of the initial response to disease progression or death for any reason) and increase the risk of tumor escape mechanisms. Antigen spreading refers to the phenomenon in which an immune response initially triggered by a targeted tumor antigen expands to recognize additional non-targeted tumor antigens (36). This highlights the need for strategies that can enhance the breadth and sustainability of the immune response in CAR-T cell therapies. The SAGAN trial is still active and recruiting additional patients with B cell lymphoma, ALL, and CLL to further compare the safety and efficacy of 2G versus 3G CAR-T cells. Similar results were reported in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial evaluating 3G CD19 CAR-T cells in patients with B cell leukemia or lymphoma. This study found that 3G CAR-T cells were well-tolerated; however, 4 patients required hospitalization due to adverse effects. Although 6 out of 16 treated patients experienced CRs, there were no significant differences in durability compared to 2G CAR-T cells (32, 37). In another study by Schubert et al., 8 patients (2 adults with r/r ALL, 2 r/r CLL, 2 DLBCL, 1 transformed FL, and 1 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)) received CD19-targeted CAR-T cells at doses of either 1x106 or 5×106 transduced cells/m2 as part of a dose-escalation protocol targeting up to 20x106 cells/m2. This study reported clinical responses even with low numbers of transferred cells, a safety profile characterized by no grade >2 of CRS or ICANS, and CAR-T cell detectability for over three months post-infusion. Additionally, CAR-T cells were observed to migrate to different regions, including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in cases of central nervous system (CNS) involvement (38).",
        "Beyond CD19, 3G CAR-T cells targeting other markers such as CD20, CD22, and HER2 have been studied (39). However, 3G CAR-T cells face numerous challenges, including high costs, manufacturing difficulties, limited efficacy in some patient populations, and tumor resistance, particularly in solid tumors with an immunosuppressive milieu. These constraints emphasize the need to rationalize the development of next-generation CAR-T cells and expand their therapeutic applications beyond hematological malignancies.",
        "Fourth-generation (4G) CAR-T cells, also known as “T cells redirected for universal cytokine-mediated killing” (TRUCKs), mark a leap forward in CAR-T cell therapy. These CAR-T cells are designed to recognize specific tumor antigens and secrete transgenic cytokines upon activation, unlike previous generations that relied on the two-signal model for T cell activation, which includes TCR (signal 1) and co-stimulatory signals (signal 2) (\nFigure 2B\n) (40). Cytokine supplementation can actively remodel the tumor microenvironment (TME) and provide a third signal required for sustained T cell responses (40, 41). TRUCKs can be engineered to secrete one or more cytokines that improve CAR-T cell function or reprogram the TME (42). Efforts to enhance T cell activity and persistence have centered on integrating cytokines such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-21, and IL-23, each offering unique advantages (40, 42). Proliferative cytokines, including IL-2 and IL-15, have been shown to enhance antitumor responses, with IL-15 playing a crucial role in T cell survival and homeostasis, yielding promising results in both preclinical and clinical settings (43). CAR-T cells engineered to co-express IL-15 have demonstrated enhanced expansion, persistence, and antitumor activity across different tumor models. In B cell malignancies, CD19-targeted CAR-T cells incorporating membrane-bound IL-15 achieved CR with incomplete blood count recovery and MRD negativity (CRi MRD-) lasting for five months in patients with r/r B-ALL. This treatment resulted in the greatest in vivo CAR-T cell expansion and persistence observed in those patients, although relapse with CD19-negative disease eventually occurred (44). In solid tumors that express disialoganglioside GD2, such as glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and lung cancer, T cells co-expressing GD2-specific CAR and IL-15 have demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy. In glioblastoma, constitutive IL-15 expression enhanced CAR-T cell proliferation and tumor clearance in an orthotopic xenograft model, supporting the translational feasibility of this approach (45). In neuroblastoma, GD2-specific CAR-T cells co-expressing IL-15 outperformed their IL-15-negative counterparts, exhibiting reduced exhaustion, improved in vivo persistence, complete tumor eradication, and protection upon tumor re-challenge in a metastatic xenograft model (46). Similarly, in lung cancer models, GD2-specific CAR-T cells expressing IL-15 and incorporating an inducible caspase-9 (iC9) safety switch demonstrated sustained persistence and robust antitumor activity, consistent with findings in other GD2-expressing tumor models (47). However, this enhanced efficacy is frequently associated with a higher incidence of CRS, as observed in Phase 1 clinical trials comparing GPC3-specific CAR-T cells with and without IL-15 expression (48). Utilizing conditional IL-2 expression in CAR-T cells could reduce the toxicity associated with systemic IL-2 administration while maintaining its effectiveness (49). Additionally, IL-7 and IL-21 promote T cell persistence and memory formation, whereas the co-expression of IL-21 and IL-15 has proven effective at controlling tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma models (50–52). Cytokine effects vary; for example, IL-23 enhances T cell survival and proliferation via autocrine signaling. In contrast, IL-7 and CCL19 increase T cell infiltration and trafficking into tumor sites, which is often impaired in the TME, as demonstrated in solid tumor and lymphoma models (53, 54). Other cytokines that have shown potential in overcoming tumor-associated challenges include IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and IL-36. IL-10 has demonstrated its ability to restore the metabolism of exhausted T cells, increasing their proliferation and cytotoxic activity. IL-12 has demonstrated substantial antitumor activity by reprogramming the TME into an immunologically active state, which activates infiltrating lymphocytes, polarizes macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory (M1) state, and reduces regulatory T cell (Treg)-mediated suppression (55, 56). Despite encouraging preclinical results, clinical application of IL-12 has been hindered by severe systemic toxicity, necessitating innovative engineering approaches to maximize benefits while minimizing risks. In response, utilizing an inducible system such as Tet-regulated IL-12 expression to fine-tune IL-12 production has demonstrated the ability to stimulate tumor immunity in vivo without the typical side effects associated with IL-12, warranting further translation of this concept into clinical applications (57). Both preclinical and clinical investigations have revealed that IL-18 can reshape the TME by reducing immunosuppressive cells and boosting pro-inflammatory activity (58). Moreover, IL-36, a recently discovered member of the IL-1 superfamily, has demonstrated potent antitumor activity in mouse models. CAR-T cells expressing IL-36γ can stimulate endogenous immunity by promoting the activation and maturation of APCs, such as dendritic cells (DCs), through increased cytokine production (such as IL-6) and upregulation of co-stimulatory and MHC molecules on their surface (59). Consequently, antigen cross-presentation is enhanced, leading to bystander T cell activation that targets tumor antigens beyond the original CAR target. This process promotes antigen spreading and amplifies the overall antitumor immune response while complementing CAR-T cell activity, suggesting that IL-36 could be a potential candidate for targeting antigen-loss tumors (59, 60). To counteract tumor heterogeneity, Flt3L-secreting CAR-T cells have been designed to enhance endogenous DC activity and promote antigen epitope spreading, especially when combined with immune agonists such as poly(I:C) and anti-4-1BB antibodies (61). Together, these advancements emphasize the importance of integrating cytokine engineering and immune-modulating approaches to improve CAR-T cell performance, particularly against solid tumors. However, TRUCKs carry an increased risk of systemic toxicity due to constitutive cytokine release and inadequate control over cytokine secretion, which can lead to on-target, off-tumor toxicity (OTOT). It is worth noting that preclinical models may not fully replicate human toxicity, raising concerns about the practical applicability of TRUCK-based therapies. These limitations indicate the need to address safety concerns, enhance the therapeutic profile, and optimize the clinical efficacy of 4G CARs. Potential strategies include using inducible cytokine expression systems, integrating synthetic cytokine receptors, and implementing safety switches to modulate T cell activity while controlling treatment-related toxicities.",
        "Building on the advancements of earlier CAR generations, fifth-generation (5G) CARs represent the most advanced generation of CAR-T cell therapy, engineered to overcome previous limitations while improving therapeutic potential and safety. These CARs are based on 2G CAR constructs but also contain a cytokine-inducible receptor that stimulates the JAK-STAT pathway. The truncated cytoplasmic IL-2 receptor β-chain is fused with a STAT3/STAT5 binding motif, allowing for antigen-dependent activation of the JAK-STAT pathway cascade (\nFigure 2B\n). This design stimulates three signaling pathways simultaneously: TCR activation (via the CD3ζ domain), co-stimulation (via the CD28 domain), and cytokine signaling (via the JAK-STAT3/5 pathway). This leads to sustained cytokine signaling without the need for exogenous cytokine support (62). By mimicking physiological T cell activation and natural cytokine signaling, 5G CARs can enhance the proliferation of less differentiated T cell populations and reduce exhaustion, a key limitation of earlier CAR-T cell therapies. Unlike 4G CAR-T cells, which enhance antitumor activity by secreting cytokines upon activation, 5G CARs incorporate cytokine signaling directly into their intracellular domains, allowing for continuous stimulation and improved resistance to exhaustion (34). Preclinical studies have shown promising results; for instance, Kagoya et al. reported that JAK-STAT-enhanced CAR-T cells surpassed earlier generation CAR-T cells in terms of tumor control, as well as expansion and persistence in CD19+ leukemia xenograft models (62). These cells also showed increased T cell proliferation and reduced terminal differentiation, contributing to sustained efficacy over time. In A375-CD19 melanoma, 5G CAR-T cells increased tumor infiltration and expansion, addressing a major hurdle in CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors. The study also revealed that 5G CAR-T cells exhibited a less differentiated, stem cell-like memory phenotype and reduced apoptosis, resulting in enhanced persistence and antitumor activity (62). The increased release of effector cytokines such as IL-2, IFNγ, and TNFα improved their cytotoxic function and contributed to overcoming the immunosuppressive TME. Despite these promising findings, further research is needed to refine the safety profile, including monitoring and mitigating CRS, optimizing dosing regimens, and expanding therapeutic applications to a broader range of malignancies.",
        "The CAR structural design can significantly influence the toxicity and efficacy of CAR-T cells. Important components that impact this design include the antigen-binding domain, co-stimulatory domains, transmembrane domains, hinge region, and the length of the endodomain (63).",
        "The antigen-binding domain, typically a scFv, is the extracellular component of a CAR that defines its specificity for the target antigen expressed in cancer cells. A scFv is a fusion protein that usually consists of variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains linked by a flexible linker peptide (64). Key considerations in scFv design include its affinity for the target antigen, specificity, and origin (e.g., murine, humanized, or fully human). The specificity and affinity of the scFv for its target antigen play important roles in T cell activation (65). Although high-affinity scFvs can induce potent T cell responses and efficient killing of target cells, the activation threshold is inversely correlated with scFv affinity such that further increases in affinity do not necessarily enhance CAR-T cell activity compared to lower-affinity immunoreceptors (65, 66). Moreover, the scFv affinity level also affects the ability of CAR-T cells to distinguish between different antigen densities, with higher-affinity CARs tend to show reduced discrimination between target cells with high or low antigen expression. Studies suggest that an optimally tuned affinity enables CAR-T cells to preferentially target tumor cells with high antigen density, thus reducing the adverse effects associated with off-target activity (64, 67). In addition, murine-derived scFvs tend to induce immune responses in patients, including humoral responses (e.g., human anti-mouse antibodies; HAMA) and cellular anti-CAR immunity. These responses can lead to complications such as anaphylaxis and reduced CAR-T cell efficacy (68). The humanization of scFvs has been shown to significantly reduce immunogenicity while improving the persistence and safety of CAR-T cells compared to their murine-based counterparts. In clinical studies, humanized CAR-T cells have demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy and durable antitumor effects in patients who previously relapsed following murine CAR-T cell treatment (69, 70). Therefore, scFv humanization is a crucial consideration in the design of CAR-T cell therapies.",
        "The choice of co-stimulatory domains can significantly influence how CAR-T cells respond upon activation by target antigens. CD28-based CARs can trigger more robust and rapid activation, along with increased cytokine release. This rapid response may lead to faster tumor killing, which can be advantageous, especially in tumors with low antigen density. However, this is also associated with a higher risk of severe CRS and ICANS. In contrast, 4-1BB-based CARs provide slower and more sustained activation, which is important for long-term efficacy when sustained T cell persistence is required for complete or prolonged antitumor responses. They typically have a lower incidence of severe CRS and ICANS compared to CD28-based CARs. Therefore, optimizing the co-stimulatory domains based on tumor burden, antigen density, and the affinity of the antigen-binding domain is important. For example, 4-1BB may work better with high tumor burden or high antigen density, whereas CD28 can provide sufficient T cell activation when the CAR’s antigen-binding domain has low affinity or the surface antigen is expressed at low density (71). Several other co-stimulatory domains, including OX40, ICOS, CD27, CD40L, and TLR2, have been explored in preclinical and clinical settings for their potential to improve the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cells. However, only CD28 and 4-1BB remain the most commonly used and FDA-approved (72). The transmembrane domain anchors the CAR to the T cell membrane and plays a crucial role in transferring the activation signal to the intracellular domains following antigen recognition. CARs can be engineered with different transmembrane moieties, mainly derived from type I single-spanning proteins, such as CD3ζ, CD4, CD8α, or CD28. Each of these has been shown to influence the overall stability and functionality of the CAR. It has been demonstrated that CD19 CARs featuring CD8α-derived transmembrane domains tend to provide more controlled activation with lower toxicity and improved persistence compared to CD28-derived transmembrane domains while achieving comparable efficacy in eradicating tumors in preclinical studies (73).",
        "Another component of the CAR structure is the hinge domain, also known as the spacer. This extracellular region connects the scFv to the transmembrane domain, providing flexibility and enabling the CAR to access antigen epitopes (74). The length, flexibility, and composition of the hinge domain can significantly influence CAR-T cell performance and safety (73, 75). Studies reveal that the optimal spacer length depends on the location of the epitope (76). Shorter spacers tend to be more effective for membrane-distal targets, whereas longer spacers offer increased flexibility, facilitating access to membrane-proximal or complex glycosylated epitopes (76, 77). Spacers are classified into two main categories: 1) IgG-based spacers, derived from the Fc region of IgG (commonly IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4), specifically the hinge plus two Ig-like domains including CH2 and CH3; 2) non-IgG-based spacers, derived from the extracellular stalks of natural T cell proteins or other receptor proteins, most commonly the CD8α or CD28 hinge regions (78) (\nFigure 3\n). Although IgG-based spacers are widely used, they can bind FcγRs, leading to off-target activation of FcγR-expressing cells and reduced CAR-T cell persistence. To mitigate these effects, modifications such as mutating or deleting the FcγR-binding domain (e.g., CH2 deletion) have been shown to enhance CAR-T cell persistence and antitumor efficacy (79–81). Moreover, the CH2-CH3 spacer has also been replaced with the extracellular domain from the nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR), serving as a modular spacer. This NGFR spacer does not interfere with the CAR’s targeting or signaling domains, allowing for effective tracking, enrichment via anti-NGFR antibodies, and functional assessment of CAR-T cells (82). Conversely, non-IgG-based spacers avoid FcγR interactions and minimize off-target activation, as demonstrated in FDA-approved CAR-T cell products (e.g., Yescarta uses a CD28 hinge; Kymriah uses a CD8α hinge) (83). However, CD28-derived spacers can increase cytokine production, T cell exhaustion, and reactivity against low antigen density compared to CD8α-derived spacers (71). This highlights the importance of spacer design in mitigating adverse effects such as CRS and ICANS by adjusting flexibility and selecting the appropriate spacer composition.",
        "Types of spacer domains in CAR design. The figure illustrates various types of spacer (hinge) regions that link the antigen-binding domain (scFv) to the transmembrane domain in CARs. IgG-based spacers include Fc regions containing CH2-CH3 domains, Fc regions modified by mutation or deletion to prevent FcγR binding, and truncated variants lacking the CH2-CH3 domains (left). Non-IgG-based spacers are derived from the extracellular stalks of natural T cell proteins, such as CD8α and CD28 hinge regions, or incorporate the nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR), which can function both as a structural spacer and as a therapeutic or selection/tracking marker (right). Created with BioRender.",
        "CAR-T cells can be genetically modified to incorporate safety switches that enable dynamic regulation of the adoptively transferred CAR-T cells in vivo, aiming to enhance the safety and efficacy of cellular therapies. These safety switches have primarily been utilized to mitigate life-threatening toxicities associated with CAR-T cell therapy, such as CRS, ICANS, and OTOT effects. Different classes of safety switches have been developed to control the activity of therapeutic T cells.",
        "Suicide switches can irreversibly inactivate T cells when triggered by a small molecule. For example, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) is activated by ganciclovir, serving as a trigger for this switch. Although HSV-TK has demonstrated well-established efficacy in clinical studies for controlling GVHD, its high immunogenicity limits its use in immunocompromised patients (84). Inducible Caspase 9 (iCasp9) is another effective suicide switch that can induce rapid and complete cell death via caspase activation upon administration of rimiducid. Another example is RQR8, which combines epitopes from both CD34 and CD20 and is activated by a CD20-specific monoclonal antibody known as rituximab (85). Although both iCasp9 and RQR8 exhibit lower immunogenicity compared to HSV-TK, they still result in irreversible T cell depletion, preventing any further benefits from the therapeutic cells that have been transferred.",
        "Unlike suicide switches, small-molecule switches enable fine-tuning of immune responses by allowing reversible control of CAR-T cell activity without permanent deactivation. These switches can be classified into three categories: on, off, and on/off dual switches. The “on” switch CARs rely on chemically induced dimerization (CIDs), which activate CARs upon recognizing their target antigen and in response to the administration of dimerizing drugs. Such systems include rapamycin-FKBP12-FRP, lenalidomide-CRBN-IKZF3, and a lipocalin-based system, A1120-hRBP4-RS3 (86–88). Furthermore, a tetracycline-based system (Tet-On) is induced by small molecules, such as tetracycline or doxycycline, allowing for the regulated expression of the CAR transgene in a dose-dependent and reversible manner (57). The second category, the “off” switches, utilizes small molecules that target degron motifs incorporated into the CAR construct. These motifs regulate the stability of the CAR protein, allowing for the inactivation of CAR-T cell activity when necessary. Examples of these regulators include ligand-induced degradation (LID) domains, protease-controlled systems, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (89–91). In addition, attaching a polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule to the surface of CAR-T cells can serve as an off-switch by generating a physical barrier that inhibits the interaction between CAR-T cells and target cells, thereby reducing adverse effects. PEG has a relatively short half-life in circulation, allowing for a controllable transition between the on and off states in CAR-T cells, which helps maintain therapeutic efficacy as needed (92).",
        "Apart from the chemically induced regulators, physical stimuli have also been employed, including light-induced nuclear translocation and dimerization (LINTAD) and focused ultrasound (FUS-CAR). LINTAD utilizes blue light as a physical stimulus to control CAR transcription, which can be instrumental in preventing OTOT toxicity induced by ACT, whereas FUS-CAR employs focused ultrasound or heat (93, 94). Although both LINTAD and FUS-CAR enable spatial control, LINTAD has low tissue penetration compared to FUS-CAR, which may limit its practical application. The FUS-CAR system may also pose challenges in clinical settings due to its complexity, which requires specialized equipment and expertise. Key challenges include potential safety risks such as tissue damage from ultrasound-induced heating or cavitation, variability in skull thickness and brain tissue composition affecting precise targeting, and the lack of real-time monitoring to confirm blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption (although this disruption can be harnessed for targeted neurotherapeutic delivery) (95, 96). Additionally, uncertainties in therapeutic dosing and limited translational predictability from preclinical models to humans further complicate the clinical adoption of this approach. Thus, further clinical validation is necessary to confirm the system’s safety, efficacy, and optimal therapeutic protocols in human patients.",
        "The concept of logic gating is inspired by computational principles known as “Boolean logic,” which includes gates such as AND, OR, and NOT. These can be applied to CAR-T cell design and function as decision-making circuits within T cells, thereby enhancing the safety, efficacy, and precision of CAR-T cell therapies. CARs implemented with these Boolean logic gate-engineered systems enable T cells to process multiple tumor-specific antigen signals, allowing them to make more refined decisions, similar to how native T cells process multiple inputs before initiating an immune response (97). By improving tumor specificity and minimizing OTOT toxicity, logic-gated CAR-T cells offer a more precise and effective strategy for reducing the likelihood of tumor antigen escape and addressing the complex and heterogeneous tumor microenvironments characteristic of solid tumors.",
        "The AND-gate requires the simultaneous occurrence of two (or more) input signals to trigger a response, acting as a two-factor authentication for immunotherapy (97) (\nFigure 4A\n). The AND-gating approach was developed from the ON system that was previously described. It expands on the ON system by incorporating a dual-signal requirement for T cell activation: one signal induces the logic-gated system, whereas the other is responsible for killing the target cell. This system also enables fine-tuning of the immune response by modulating input signal levels, such as adjusting the concentrations of pharmacological agents. AND-gated CAR-T cells are categorized based on how the dual-input signals are engineered and processed. These include different strategies, such as dual antigen-binding CARs, split-signaling CARs, and synNotch receptors. In the case of split-recognition AND-gates, T cells are engineered with two distinct components: a CAR with reduced affinity for one antigen, containing only an activation domain (commonly CD3ζ), and a chimeric co-stimulatory receptor (CCR) that targets a different antigen, which includes only a co-stimulatory domain (typically derived from CD28 and/or 4-1BB) without an activation domain. Full T cell activation occurs only when both antigens are present, thereby protecting healthy cells that express just one of the antigens. This strategy has been validated in several preclinical studies, demonstrating its potential to enhance tumor specificity while minimizing off-target effects (98–101).",
        "Boolean logic-gate strategies in CAR-T cells. The figure illustrates four types of logic-gated CAR-T cell circuits designed to enhance tumor specificity and reduce off-target effects: (A) AND-gate: CAR-T cells are activated only when both antigens A and B are present, (B) OR-gate: CAR-T cells are activated when either antigen A or B is present, (C) NOT-gate: CAR-T cell activation is inhibited by the presence of antigen B; and D: AND-NOT gate: CAR-T cell activation requires the presence of both antigens A and B, but the absence of antigen (C) Created with BioRender.",
        "Another AND-gated mechanism leveraging synNotch receptors was developed in 2016; it is an engineered transcriptional regulator designed to control CAR expression in a sequential and programmable manner. This system consists of two key elements: a synNotch receptor that targets a primary antigen (antigen A) and a conventional CAR that targets a second antigen (antigen B), whose expression is controlled by the synNotch receptor. Upon binding to antigen A, the synNotch receptor undergoes cleavage, releasing an intracellular domain that acts as a transcription factor, activating CAR expression, which subsequentially targets antigen B. For example, researchers developed a two-step feedback circuit that allows for precise target discrimination based on antigen density in HER2+ tumors, utilizing a low-affinity synNotch receptor for HER2 to regulate the expression of a high-affinity HER2-specific CAR. This design generates a sigmoidal response, in which increasing HER2 density enhances both CAR expression and T cell activation. As a result, T cells can efficiently discriminate between normal cells with low HER2 levels and cancer cells with high HER2 levels (102). The synNotch system has been applied across different cancer models, including leukemia, ovarian cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and glioblastoma (97). However, these receptors are limited by their ability to recognize only cell surface markers and are unable to detect soluble molecules in the TME. To address this limitation, Roybal and colleagues developed a new generation of receptors called synthetic intramembrane proteolysis receptors (SNIPRs), capable of responding to soluble ligands. SNIPRs can be activated by both natural and synthetic soluble factors (103). CAR-T cells engineered with SNIPRs targeting two soluble immune molecules, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)—which are often highly expressed in the TME—demonstrated CAR-T cell activation only in the presence of these two molecules. In an A375 xenograft in vivo model, these SNIPR-equipped CAR-T cells demonstrated a reduction in tumor burden without any detectable side effects (103).",
        "Unlike AND-gating, the OR-gate strategy involves designing T cells to recognize multiple antigens, where the recognition of any of the targeted antigens can activate the CAR-T cells. The OR-gating design enhances their ability to target heterogeneous tumors and increases the likelihood of tumor eradication (\nFigure 4B\n). This approach can be achieved by either pooling single-target CAR-T cells or engineering a single receptor to target multiple antigens, such as a dual CAR (biCAR), tandem CAR (TanCAR), or even TriCAR. In preclinical and clinical studies, OR-gated CAR-T cells have shown improved tumor eradication compared to single-target therapies (104). For example, pooling two single-specific CAR-T cells targeting CD19 and CD123 improved tumor clearance, particularly in cases of antigen-loss relapse following CD19-targeted immunotherapies in B-ALL. A comparable effect has also been observed in solid tumors, such as glioblastoma, when targeting HER2 and IL-13Rα2 (105, 106). Another study evaluated the efficacy of tandem CD19/CD22 dual-target CAR-T cells in patients with r/r B-ALL. This study demonstrated that this approach has the potential to improve outcomes and overcome antigen loss, leading to higher remission rates, particularly in patients for whom single-target therapies may be insufficient (104).",
        "Furthermore, clinical trials with TanCARs, which feature a single CAR molecule targeting two antigens simultaneously, such as CD19 and CD20, have shown promising results in r/r B-ALL. Similarly, TanCARs exhibited superior tumor control in solid tumors such as glioblastoma compared to dual CAR-T cells (106). Despite these advancements, challenges such as CRS-related OTOT toxicities remain, highlighting the importance of careful antigen selection and safety measures in OR-gated CAR-T cell designs.",
        "Some tumor antigens, such as tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), are not exclusively expressed by tumor cells and may also be found at low levels in healthy tissues. To differentiate between tumor cells from healthy ones, NOT-gate strategies are designed to protect healthy tissues that express both a selected tumor antigen targeted by CAR-T cells and a second antigen, called a protective antigen, which is typically present on healthy cells but not on tumor cells. The NOT-gate incorporates inhibitory signaling domains to suppress T cell activation upon recognition of the protective antigen, thereby preventing damage to healthy tissues during CAR-T cell therapy (97) (\nFigure 4C\n). Unlike suicide switches that eliminate T cells irrespective of their therapeutic efficacy, NOT-gates provide a reversible safety mechanism particularly useful for targeting TAAs without inducing permanent anergy in therapeutic T cells.",
        "One mechanism of NOT-gates involves inhibitory CARs (iCARs), which include inhibitory signaling domains such as PD-1 or CTLA-4 and are co-expressed with TAA-specific CARs. iCARs are designed to counteract the activation triggered by the standard CAR that targets the TAA (107). In preclinical studies, iCARs demonstrated reduced cytokine production and cytotoxicity when co-cultured with cells expressing both tumor and healthy antigens, such as CD19 and PSMA, respectively, compared to cells expressing only the tumor antigen (CD19). In in vivo experiments using leukemia models, iCARs selectively reduced tumor burden without harming normal tissue that express both CD19 and PSMA. However, optimal iCAR-mediated suppression depends on balancing inhibitory signals from the protective antigen with activating signals from the tumor antigen, which may not be feasible for all tumor targets (107). Additionally, early findings suggest that iCARs may influence T cell phenotype, as exhaustion markers such as PD-1 and TIM-3 are reduced in T cells engineered with NOT-gated CARs targeting CD93 and CD19 (108). Despite these promising observations, the long-term effects of iCAR activation on T cell fitness remain underexplored. Several studies have also examined iCARs incorporating various inhibitory signaling domains derived from T or NK cells, such as PD-1, BTLA, and LIR1 (109). These iCARs are designed to suppress T cell activation upon engagement with non-target antigens, thus enhancing the specificity and safety of CAR-T cell therapies by preventing off-target cytotoxicity in healthy tissues.",
        "Moreover, another mechanism of NOT-gating is competitive inhibition, as demonstrated in the SUPRA CAR (split, universal, and programmable CAR) system, an innovative advancement in CAR-T cell therapy that enhances versatility, precision, and safety (110). This system features a modular split design composed of two components: a membrane-bound receptor expressed on T cells (zipCAR) and a soluble antigen-targeting fragment (zipFv). The zipFv consists of a scFv directed against the target antigen, fused to a leucine zipper domain (AZip) that interacts with the complementary leucine zipper (BZip) on the zipCAR. The zipCAR is a universal receptor that includes both intracellular signaling domains and an extracellular BZip domain (110, 111). A functional CAR is reconstituted when the AZip domain binds to the BZip, inducing T cell activation. Importantly, zipFv molecules targeting protective antigens on healthy tissue can act as competitive inhibitors, blocking CAR activation in the presence of normal tissue signals and thereby reducing off-target toxicity. This design enables SUPRA CARs to rapidly reprogram T cell specificity and switch targets, such as new tumor antigens, by administering different zipFv proteins without the need to re-engineer T cells themselves, making it particularly effective for addressing antigen escape or relapse (112). Additionally, the affinity between the leucine zippers can be adjusted to control the strength of T cell activation. Thus, SUPRA CARs provide a highly adaptable and precise approach to cancer immunotherapy by allowing fine-tuned activation, logical antigen sensing, and enhanced specificity and safety in therapeutic applications (111).",
        "In addition to the biological NOT-gating systems that stimulate T cell cytotoxicity, innovative systems like the CRASH-IT switch—a small, pharmacologically mediated off-switch—offer titratable control over T cell function, allowing for repeatable activation without destroying the engineered cells. Although these approaches are promising, challenges remain in ensuring that inhibitory signals are effective for all tumor antigens, particularly those with low expression in healthy cells (113).",
        "Furthermore, in a combined AND-NOT gate approach, CAR-T cell activation requires the presence of two antigens (AND-gate) and the absence of a third antigen that serves as an inhibitory signal (NOT-gate) (\nFigure 4D\n). This dual-signal requirement enhances targeting specificity, thereby improving both accuracy and therapeutic safety (114). An example of an AND-NOT gate system is the Co-LOCKR platform, which activates CAR-T cells only upon recognition of two antigens (A and B) while excluding a third antigen (C). It utilizes intermediary proteins known as Cage and Key to identify and bind to target cells. The Cage protein is designed to target antigen A and conceals a recruitment peptide that can be recognized by a universal CAR. When the Key protein binds to antigen B, it unlocks the Cage, revealing the peptide and triggering the activation of T cells. A third soluble component, the Decoy, binds to the Key if antigen C is present, thus preventing Cage activation and blocking CAR-T cell activation (115). This design enables precise targeting by ensuring that activation occurs only when both desired antigens are present and the protective antigen is absent. Another recently reported antigen-driven AND-NOT circuit employs a synNotch receptor, which regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic factor tBID upon antigen binding, offering a novel gated mechanism to fine-tune T cell activation (116). In addition, some evidence suggests that logic-gated T cells may positively influence T cell phenotype and fitness by maintaining a more naive-like state (CD62L+ CD45RA+) and reducing the expression of checkpoint molecules. This outcome may result from modifications in receptor design that eliminate tonic signaling, thereby preserving T cell differentiation and improving persistence (117).",
        "CAR-T cell therapy has transformed cancer treatment; however, its broader application is hindered by challenges such as immune evasion, T cell exhaustion, and immunological complications, including GVHD induced by allogeneic T cell products. To overcome these obstacles and enhance the fitness, safety, and efficacy of CAR-T cells, gene editing technologies have become increasingly central to the evolution of CAR-T cell therapy. While most CAR designs to date have relied on viral vectors for gene delivery—a practical approach that lacks genomic precision—recent gene editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9, TALENs, and more recently, base and prime editing, enable targeted modifications. These innovations can enhance persistence, tumor infiltration, and resistance to an immunosuppressive TME. They also facilitate the development of “off-the-shelf” allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies, streamlining treatment processes and increasing accessibility. Genetic engineering platforms can be broadly categorized into irreversible gene editing tools and reversible gene modulation tools.",
        "Classical gene editing methods used in T cell modifications include zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and meganucleases, which recognize long DNA sequences typically 14–40 base pairs in length. These tools induce double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) at specific loci, which are then repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) to knockout or knock-in the genes of interest, respectively (118). Despite their initial success, ZFNs and TALENs have encountered limitations that hinder their broad implementation, such as technical complexity, low efficiency in multiplex gene editing, high costs, and off-target effects, particularly in large-scale allogeneic CAR-T cell manufacturing. As a result, these methods have been largely replaced by more efficient technologies, particularly clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9), which has emerged as a paradigm shift in T cell engineering due to its programmability, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility.",
        "CRISPR-Cas9 is a game-changing development in gene and cell therapy. It utilizes a programmable guide RNA (gRNA) to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to a specific DNA sequence of interest. Cas9 induces DSBs at the targeted site, enabling gene deletion, insertion, or precise modifications (119). This versatility has accelerated the development of universal “off-the-shelf” CAR-T cells by knocking out essential T cell genes, including TCR and HLA, to mitigate GVHD and host immune rejection (120, 121). CRISPR technology can also disrupt immune checkpoint signaling (e.g., PD-1, LAG-3, and TIM-3) to improve CAR-T cell persistence and diminish TME-induced exhaustion (122). In addition, multiplexed CRISPR gene editing has enabled the integration of synthetic receptors, modulation of cytokine secretion, and reprogramming of metabolic pathways to optimize CAR-T cell therapy (119). However, reliance on DSBs presents potential risks, such as chromosomal rearrangements, off-target genomic changes, and unpredictable DNA repair outcomes (123). Thus, other gene editing methods, such as base editing and prime editing, have emerged to overcome these constraints.",
        "Base editing bypasses the need for DSBs, HDR, or donor DNA templates, making it suitable for both dividing and non-dividing cells (124). Base editors (BEs) create a single-stranded DNA nick by using an engineered catalytically inactive Cas9 endonuclease variant (nickase Cas9 or nCas9), which has been altered in either the D10A or H840A nuclease domains. BEs are proteins composed of a D10A-nCas9 linked to a deaminase enzyme, such as cytidine or adenosine deaminase, which chemically converts specific nucleotides, such as cytosine-to-thymine (C→T) or adenine-to-guanine (A→ G), respectively (125, 126). This technology reduces the risk of genetic instability, offering a safer alternative to conventional CRISPR-Cas9 methods. However, conventional BEs, such as cytidine base editors (CBEs) and adenosine base editors (ABEs), are limited to transition mutations (purine-to-purine or pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine) and are unable to introduce transversion mutations or large-scale genetic modifications required for gene knockouts or knock-ins. To enhance base editing capabilities, glycosylase base editors (CGBEs) incorporate uracil glycosylase enzymes or error-prone polymerases into the basic CBE architecture, enabling C*G to G*C transversions (127). Similarly, adenine transversion base editors (AYBEs) have been developed from ABEs to enable A*T to C*G transversions (128). Despite challenges related to unintended edits and off-target effects, advancements in protein engineering, enhanced delivery methods, and advanced Cas9 variants can significantly improve the safety and therapeutic effectiveness of base editing.",
        "Prime editing is another advanced gene editing method that offers improved accuracy over traditional CRISPR-Cas9 by enabling targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 possible base substitutions without relying on DSBs, donor DNA templates, or cellular DNA repair pathways. Prime editors (PEs) consist of a Cas9 nickase (commonly Cas9-H840A) linked to a reverse transcriptase enzyme (nCas9-RT), which is guided by a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) that encodes the desired genetic sequence (129). This approach surpasses standard CRISPR-Cas9 editing in terms of selectivity and off-target effects. However, PEs currently have low editing efficiency, which varies by genomic locus and cell type. Additionally, the large size of PE constructs exceeds the packaging capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, presenting delivery challenges for in vivo therapeutic applications (125, 130). To address these limitations, researchers are focusing on developing next-generation PE variants with higher fidelity and efficiency, optimizing pegRNA design, and investigating alternative non-viral delivery strategies, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNs) and electroporation-based ribonucleoprotein (RNP) systems (125).",
        "Beyond genomic changes, emerging methods such as epigenome editing and RNA editing offer transient and reversible therapies. These strategies enable engineered CAR-T cells to dynamically adjust their fate and function while preserving the underlying genome.",
        "Epigenome editing employs a catalytically inactive/dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to transcriptional activators (CRISPRa) or repressors/interference modules (CRISPRi), allowing for precise and tunable control of gene expression without altering DNA sequences (131). This approach can enhance CAR-T cell persistence by preventing or reversing exhaustion and improving tumor infiltration. dCas9 can also be linked to epigenetic regulators for DNA methylation (silencing) or DNA demethylation (activation). For example, knocking down the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A) helps preserve CAR-T cells in a memory-like phenotype, sustaining long-term antitumor activity, whereas disrupting the histone methyltransferase (SUV39H1) prevents terminal differentiation and maintains cytotoxic function (132, 133). Similarly, knocking down PRDM1 (encoding Blimp1) decreases the expression of exhaustion markers while retaining a less differentiated and highly functional phenotype characterized by increased cytokine output and prolonged persistence (134).",
        "In therapeutic settings, safety switches can be integrated to ensure the safe and controlled application of these methods. Beyersdorf et al. demonstrated that non-viral delivery of AcrIIA4 mRNA can inhibit gene activation when co-administered with an mRNA-expressed dCas9 activator, representing a strategy to enhance the safety profile of this approach (135). Moreover, the fusion of dCas9 to the catalytic domain of ten-eleven translocation dioxygenase 1 (TET1) provides a programmable and locus-specific demethylation tool that enables the targeted removal of DNA methylation, thereby reactivating silenced genes (136). By contrast, CRISPRoff is an epigenetic memory editor that utilizes a fusion protein composed of dCas9 and epigenetic effector domains such as KRAB and DNMT3A-DNMT3L. This enables the heritable silencing of most genes that persists through cell divisions and supports multiplexed targeting by supplying one or multiple gRNAs simultaneously, which can be fully reversed by the CRISPRon system (137).",
        "RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that alters the nucleotide sequence of RNA transcripts without modifying the underlying DNA. A well-characterized form of RNA editing relies on adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADARs) to convert adenosine (A) to inosine (I) within double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a process known as A-to-I editing. Inosine is commonly interpreted as guanosine (G) during translation, which can potentially alter protein function or affect RNA stability (138). This modification predominantly occurs in dsRNA structures and plays a crucial role in regulating innate immune responses. ADAR1-mediated editing suppresses the activation of endogenous dsRNA sensors, including MDA5, PKR, OAS, and ZBP1, thereby preventing aberrant innate immune sensing and maintaining immune homeostasis (138, 139). A deficiency in ADAR1 leads to the accumulation of unedited endogenous dsRNA, resulting in chronic inflammation and sustained type I interferon signaling, a hallmark of several autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases (140). Based on this natural regulatory mechanism, engineered RNA editing platforms have recently emerged as tools to precisely and reversibly modulate gene expression in adoptive cell therapies, such as CAR-T cells. Several approaches utilize endogenous ADARs for targeted RNA editing, such as the LEAPER and CLUSTER systems, in which antisense RNAs are designed to direct natural ADAR enzymes to specific transcripts. Other technologies, including REPAIR and RESCUE, involve the exogenous delivery of programmable RNA editors that utilize a catalytically inactive Cas13 (dCas13) linked to an engineered ADAR2 domain, enabling targeted A-to-I or C-to-U base editing. REPAIR facilitates A-to-I RNA editing, whereas RESCUE enables both A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing (141, 142). Recently, Tieu et al. developed a multiplexed effector guide array (MEGA) platform, a CRISPR-based RNA editing system designed to modulate the T cell transcriptome using the RNA-guided, RNA-targeting activity of CRISPR-Cas13d. This system enables quantitative, reversible, and multiplexed gene knockdown in primary human T cells (143). In this study, the MEGA platform was successfully applied to suppress the upregulation of inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1, LAG3, and TIM-3), identify paired regulators of T cell function through combinatorial screening, and optimize immunoregulatory metabolic pathways, all of which contributed to improved CAR-T cell fitness and antitumor activity.",
        "Ex vivo CAR-T cell therapies have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in treating B cell malignancies. However, their broader clinical applicability is hindered by several challenges, including complex and costly manufacturing processes, long turnaround times, and logistical barriers associated with harvesting and engineering a patient’s own T cells. To overcome these limitations, in vivo CAR-T cell therapy has emerged as an alternative method. This approach involves engineering T cells directly within the body using viral or non-viral gene delivery systems rather than isolating and manipulating patient cells outside the body (ex vivo). By eliminating the need for personalized cell processing, this strategy enables faster production, reduced costs, and improved scalability, potentially overcoming current roadblocks in CAR-T cell therapy. An important milestone was achieved in the late 2010s when research revealed that functional CAR-T cells could be generated directly in the body using lentiviral vectors (LVs) and polymeric nanoparticles. These in vivo-engineered T cells successfully eradicated CD19+ leukemia cells in preclinical models, paving the way for future clinical trials (144, 145).",
        "Viral vectors, including LVs and AAV, provide high transduction efficiency and durable CAR expression, making them ideal for in vivo CAR-T cell engineering (146, 147). However, concerns remain about LV-associated insertional mutagenesis and AAV-associated pre-existing immunity, indicating the need for alternative delivery methods (147). Non-viral delivery platforms, such as LNPs and polymer-based nanoparticles, have emerged as safer and transient options that eliminate the risk of genomic integrations (144, 148).",
        "Inspired by mRNA vaccine technology, CAR delivery via LNP-based mRNA—the same platform used in the first two COVID-19 vaccines granted Emergency Use Authorization—has demonstrated rapid CAR-T cell induction, enhanced T cell migration, and modulation of T cell phenotype. However, due to the transient nature of RNA-mediated gene expression, repeated dosing may be necessary to maintain efficacy (149). Preclinical success has driven early-phase clinical trials to assess the feasibility of in vivo CAR-T cell therapies in both blood and solid tumors. Nevertheless, several challenges remain, especially the need to achieve precise gene delivery to T cells while avoiding off-target transduction in Tregs or tumor cells, which could compromise antitumor immunity (147). Furthermore, the mRNA cargo delivered by LNPs can pose toxicity risks, including innate immune activation, protein overexpression, and mRNA degradation, which may trigger unintended immune responses and systemic inflammation. For example, as mRNA is inherently unstable and prone to degradation, the resulting RNA fragments can act as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which potentially induce cytokine release and tissue-specific toxicities, such as myocarditis. To mitigate these risks, there is a growing demand for incorporating safety switches that can dynamically regulate CAR expression in real-time (150). To pave the way for broader clinical use of in vivo CAR-T cell therapies, several major challenges still need to be addressed. These include enhancing target specificity using ligand-directed targeting vectors while avoiding off-target effects in non-target cells. Strategies such as cell type-restricted gene expression and the use of synthetic biology tools to finely control immune responses are key to moving forward. Additionally, utilizing drug-inducible CAR systems and self-regulating immune circuits may also help improve T cell activity and persistence while reducing toxicity (146). With continuing advances in gene editing and synthetic immunology, in vivo CAR-T cell therapies hold the potential to expand access to cellular immunotherapies, making personalized cancer treatment more scalable and globally accessible.",
        "CAR-based therapy has extended beyond T cells, paving the way for a new generation of engineered immune cells that aim to address some of the key challenges of conventional CAR-T cell therapies. As the field evolves, CAR-M and CAR-NK cells are emerging as promising therapeutic options. Each type of cell offers unique capabilities that could help enhance antitumor immunity.",
        "CAR-NK cells build on the core framework of CAR-T cell technology but are engineered with features tailored to their innate immune functions. Unlike T cells, NK cells express unique surface receptors but lack antigen-specific TCRs. Instead, they rely on innate immune signaling mediated by a diverse array of activating and inhibitory receptors for their activation and function. For example, the activating receptor NKG2D recognizes stress-induced ligands such as MICA and MICB proteins, which are upregulated on virus-infected or cancer cells, triggering rapid NK cell cytotoxicity (151). The net balance of activating and inhibitory inputs ultimately determines the activation of NK cells. Thus, when inhibitory receptors (e.g., KIRs) are unable to detect self-MHC class I (MHC-I) on a target cell due to loss or reduced expression of MHC-I—a phenomenon called “missing-self” recognition—the unopposed activating signals license NK cells to activate and eliminate aberrant cells (152). To address this difference, CAR-NK constructs often incorporate NK-specific signaling domains such as NKG2D, DAP10, and DAP12, which play essential roles in activating NK cell cytotoxic functions (153). These specialized components help improve both the longevity and effectiveness of CAR-NK cell therapies by aligning with the unique activation mechanisms of NK cells. However, one primary challenge with NK cell therapies is their shorter lifespan compared to T cells, which can limit their effectiveness in the body (154). To overcome this issue, next-generation CAR-NK cells have been engineered to produce supportive cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-15 to enhance their ability to survive and expand post-infusion (155). Another advantage is that NK cells naturally lack the TCR, unlike allogeneic CAR-T cell products, which typically require gene editing to remove endogenous TCRs and prevent GVHD. This makes CAR-NK cells particularly appealing as ready-to-use, off-the-shelf therapies (156). Early clinical trials, including those for hematological cancers, have shown encouraging results with improved response rates and fewer severe side effects, including CRS and ICANS. Nevertheless, challenges such as lower transduction efficiency continue to drive ongoing investigations into improving gene delivery methods, including feeder cell-based expansion systems and advanced gene editing approaches to enhance their in vivo persistence (157).",
        "Macrophages are naturally capable of infiltrating solid tumors, reshaping the TME, and maintaining a sustained antitumor response. Building upon these innate properties, CAR-Ms have emerged as an exciting new approach to overcoming key limitations of CAR-T cell therapies, particularly in the treatment of solid tumors. Although CD3ζ is not macrophage-specific and is expressed only in a minor subset of pro-inflammatory (CD3+) macrophages, studies have shown that CAR-Ms incorporating CD3ζ can mediate antigen-dependent phagocytosis and direct antitumor activity in macrophages (158). While structurally similar to CAR-T cell constructs, first-generation CAR-Ms utilize the CD3ζ signaling domain, canonical to T cells, to trigger a phagocytic response upon antigen engagement. Furthermore, engineering induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages (iMACs) with dual-signaling CARs containing both CD3ζ and Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains has been shown to significantly enhance antitumor immunity, promote antigen-dependent phagocytosis, and drive M1-like polarization (159). CAR-M therapies not only improve tumor clearance but also reprogram the TME toward a pro-inflammatory state by secreting mediators such as metalloproteinases (MMPs), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and serine proteases, which collectively diminish M2-type immunosuppression and facilitate immune cell infiltration (159, 160). Unlike CAR-T cells, which primarily mediate direct cytotoxicity, CAR-Ms not only induce antigen-specific phagocytosis but also concurrently cross-present tumor antigens and deliver co-stimulatory signals, thereby stimulating T cells and initiating adaptive immune responses (158, 161). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that CAR-Ms selectively phagocytose tumors, reduce tumor burden, and extend overall survival (158). Moreover, CAR-Ms can be engineered or combined with anti-CD47 antibodies to block the CD47-SIRPα (“do not eat me”) signaling pathway, thereby resisting immunosuppression in the TME. Similar to CAR-NK cells, CAR-Ms pose a minimal risk of GVHD due to their rapid extravasation from the bloodstream and limited in vivo expansion. However, because macrophages lack the proliferative capacity of T cells, enhancing CAR-M scalability and persistence will likely rely on strategies such as off-the-shelf cell therapies (e.g., CAR-iMacs) or combination therapies with T cell-based approaches (162, 163).",
        "While CAR-T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematological malignancies, its application in solid tumors remains in the early stages and continues to face significant challenges. Recently, the FDA granted accelerated approval to lifecycle (Amtagvi) for advanced melanoma, marking it as the first cell therapy approved for a solid tumor (164), which is a significant milestone for the field. However, major hurdles remain, including antigen heterogeneity, an immunosuppressive TME, and safety concerns. Next-generation CAR designs are emerging to address these limitations through different functional strategies (\nFigure 5\n). For example, multi-specific and logic-gated receptors enhance antigen specificity and effector function, while safety switches and in vivo delivery platforms improve safety and reduce toxicity. Additionally, armored CARs and engineered immune effector cells help overcome TME-mediated immunosuppression. Moreover, computational tools, including multi-omics data integration, in silico CAR design, and biomarker-based models, are accelerating the rational selection of targets and therapeutic optimization (165). With ongoing advances in cellular engineering, computational bioscience (data-driven design), and scalable manufacturing, CAR-based immunotherapies are rapidly evolving toward safer, more precise, and broadly applicable treatments across diverse cancer types and other immune-mediated diseases.",

        "This graphical abstract compares the hypothetical timelines of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy (green line) and CD19-TCE (purple line) in the context of autoimmune disease flare. CAR T-cell therapy is often limited to specialized centers due to its high-production costs, labor-intensive process, delayed effector T-cell pool establishment, and tolerability issues with prerequisite toxic lymphodepleting chemotherapy, potentially restricting its use and impacting patient outcomes. In contrast, CD19-TCB, readily available and immediately deployable upon disease flare detection, mitigates the risks associated with disease progression due to delays in CAR T-cell therapy access.",
        "Graphical Abstract",
        "B- and T-cell (B–T-cell) collaboration perpetuates chronic inflammation in a range of autoimmune diseases (AID) including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and multiple sclerosis (MS) [1, 2]. This cellular collaboration may occur through contact-dependent or -independent pathways through cytokines and other immune stimuli. Within lymphoid aggregates and the germinal center, B–T-cell interactions involve an array of molecular pairings [3], summarized in Fig. 1 and Table 1. These signals stimulate T-cell secretion of cytokines and promote differentiation of naïve to memory B cells and plasma cells (PCs), Fig. 1. Some of these pathways have been targeted, as discussed later, whereas others are the subject of novel therapeutic strategies.",

        "Pathways of B–T-cell co-stimulation and trials of therapeutic agents. Molecular pairings are explained in Table 1. Drugs that target co-stimulation are outlined here. Dapirolizumab is an anti-CD40L mAb, currently in phase III study in SLE (NCT04294667). Bleslumab is an IgG4 mAb that targets CD40 which underwent phase II trial in plaque psoriasis with no clinical improvement compared to placebo [4], and demonstrated non-inferiority compared with standard of care for acute rejection in renal transplant recipients [5]. Iscalimab is another anti-CD40 mAb which is undergoing phase II trial in SLE and Sjogren’s Syndrome (NCT03656562, NCT04541589). Abatacept inhibits CD80/86 to prevent engagement with CD28 and is approved for use in RA but failed to meet the primary endpoint in the lupus nephritis phase III trial. AMG 557, anti-ICOSL antibody, underwent phase II trial in SLE and a newer therapy inhibiting ICOSL and BAFF is undergoing phase II trial (NCT04058028). PD-1 agonist, Peresolimab demonstrated modest improvement in disease activity in a phase II trial for patients with RA. Image created using Biorender.com",
        "In this context of an ongoing immune response, an appreciation of B-cell biology is helpful. B cells originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and undergo differentiation in secondary lymphoid organs [6]. Differential expression of various cell surface markers, including cluster of differentiation (CD) molecules and immunoglobulin isotypes help to define classical subpopulations including naïve B cells (IgD+CD27−), unswitched memory B cells (IgD+CD27+), switched memory B cells (IgD−CD27+) and double negative memory B cells (IgD−CD27−) [6]. Naïve B cells have not yet encountered antigen, whereas switched memory B cells are primed to respond to antigen and double negative memory B cells increase with aging, autoimmunity, and chronic infectious diseases [7]. Until recently, the focus of B-cell depletion therapy has been on rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that is widely used in hematological malignancies and AID (discussed in more detail below). The first FDA approved targeted biologic therapy for SLE was Belimumab, a mAb directed at B-cell activating factor (BAFF, also known as BLyS) [8], however, real-world data demonstrates variable success [9, 10]. BAFF is a B-cell survival and differentiation factor and is elevated in the serum of patients with SLE [11].",
        "B–T-cell interactions in the peripheral inflammatory sites of various AID including RA SLE, type I diabetes mellitus, and celiac disease exhibit a population of T cells which are termed T-peripheral helper cells [1, 12, 13]. Rao et al. identified these cells, adjacent to B cells in lymphoid aggregates of the synovium in patients with RA as PD-1hiCXCR5−CD4+ which lack Bcl6 but produce IL-21 and CXCL13, resulting in B-cell differentiation into plasmablasts (PBs) [14]. This perpetuates B–T-cell networking in inflamed tissues, where ectopic lymphoid structures [15] are formed. Thus, B–T-cell collaboration occurs in both lymphoid tissues and at sites of inflammation.",
        "B–T-cell collaboration is a dominant source of chronic inflammation in AID. Hence, disrupting this network is an appealing therapeutic strategy. Over the past four decades, B–T-cell co-stimulation was targeted through different pathways such as alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, CAMPATH-1H), abatacept (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 immunoglobulin), and dapirolizumab (anti-CD40L) with variable impact on B-cell depletion (BCD), Fig. 2. In the 1980s, alemtuzumab was used to deplete CD52 expressing cells including B and T cells, providing the first insights into disrupting B–T-cell networking. The 1990s trials of alemtuzumab in RA were terminated due to suboptimal therapeutic index probably owing to prolonged depletion of regulatory T cells [16], although it continues to be used to treat MS (albeit at lower doses). Abatacept inhibits the co-stimulatory CD28-CD80/86 pathway and is approved for RA [17] although the ALLURE trial of abatacept in lupus nephritis (LN) did not meet its primary endpoint [18]. Attempts have been made to block other key co-stimulatory signaling pathways including the CD40-CD40L axis. Second-generation agents have been developed including dapirolizumab-pegol which had favorable biomarker and safety response in SLE [19]; phase III results are awaited (NCT04294667). Therefore, despite these advances, there remains a great unmet need for disrupting B–T-cell collaboration in refractory patients with AID.",
        "Historical timeline of therapies that target B–T-cell collaboration in autoimmune disease. These agents were designed either to deplete B cells and/or disrupt the B–T-cell collaboration. The top row denotes the target antigen, the second row demonstrates the drugs that have undergone clinical trial (later two, t are yet to undergo clinical trial in AID). The third row represents therapies that interrupt B–T-cell networking and the fourth row represents treatments that employ T cells as effector cells. Text in italics under CD20 represents other approved anti-CD20 mAbs, *denotes pending approval",
        "In the past three decades, BCD therapy with the CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, has revolutionized the treatment of severe or refractory AID and has been approved for use in RA [20], ANCA vasculitis [21], and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) [22] and is prescribed widely “off-licence” in SLE [23] and in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) [24]. Data from the Lupus Nephritis Assessment with Rituximab (LUNAR) study reported complete BCD with complete response, as defined in the study [25]. However, there remains a significant proportion of patients, up to 30%, who have disease refractory to rituximab, particularly in the context of incomplete BCD [23] and/or repopulation with PB and switched memory B cells (IgD−CD27+, SwMBC) [26].",
        "B cells can evade rituximab’s effects either through intrinsic mechanisms (lacking CD20 expression and antigenic modulation) or extrinsic mechanisms such as restricted vascular access to effector cells as discussed previously [27]. Upon activation, naïve B cells solicit T-cell co-stimulation in lymphoid tissues and at sites of inflammation such as the joint and the kidney to differentiate into memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells including short-lived CD19+CD20− PBs and long-lived CD20− PCs [14, 28]. In RA, rituximab fails to completely deplete SwMBC and CD19+CD20− PCs in lymphoid tissues [29], joints, and bone marrow [30–32] contributing to poor response. In patients with ITP with poor response to rituximab, autoreactive splenic memory B cells down-regulate their BCR and up-regulate anti-apoptotic proteins and evades rituximab while retaining the capacity to reactivate and differentiate into autoantibody secreting CD19+CD20− PBs [24]. In muscle-specific kinase myasthenia gravis, autoreactive SwMBC evades rituximab and differentiate into autoantibody secreting CD19+CD20− PBs contributing to relapse [33]. Further, rituximab has no direct effect on CD19+CD20− PBs and PCs, as they do not express CD20 [34, 35]. Thus, SwMBCs, CD19+CD20− PBs and CD19+CD20− PCs evade rituximab through distinct mechanisms, Fig. 3.",
        "Life cycle of B lineage cells. B cells originate in the bone marrow and migrate through peripheral circulation into lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes and the spleen. Naïve B cells mature into memory B cells which then differentiate into switched memory B cells, SwMBC (IgD−,CD27+), or double negative memory B cells (DN MBC; IgD−, CD27−) entering the peripheral circulation or plasma blasts (PBs) and plasma cells (PCs) a majority of which reside in the bone marrow, tissues, and inflammatory sites. Proportions of CD19+CD20+ versus CD19+CD20− B cells are demonstrated pictorially within each subpopulation. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab may not completely deplete CD19+CD20+ B cells in tissue and do not target CD19+CD20− B cells, therefore, alternative strategies of depletion including CD19 targeting approaches may help to overcome rituximab resistance in autoimmunity",
        "Broadly, anti-CD20 mAbs can be grouped into types I and II, where type I mAbs such as rituximab, are more efficient at clustering CD20 compared to type II anti-CD20 mAbs [36]. This enables efficient complement activation and therefore enhanced complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), however, it also increases the propensity for internalization of CD20:CD20 mAb complexes by B cells [37]. In addition, incomplete BCD with rituximab may be related to its internalization of rituximab [38]. Type II anti-CD20 mAbs such as obinutuzumab may, at least in part, overcome this resistance mechanism [27]. In a pivotal phase II study, obinutuzumab was shown to improve clinical response in LN [39] and phase III studies are ongoing. However, CD19+CD20− PBs and CD19+CD20− PCs are still not directly targeted. Furthermore, disease-associated macrophage phagocytic defects [40] and vascular access limitations may compromise the ability of anti-CD20 mAbs (and other B-cell depleting mAbs, such as those directed to CD19) to evoke antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) [27, 41] as they rely on FcγR-bearing effector cells. In addition, NK cells are also scarce in tissues, limiting antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). For example, we have previously reported that incomplete depletion and/ or persistent infiltration of B cells in the kidneys was associated with active LN refractory to rituximab [42].",
        "Through histological analysis of kidney [43] and skin [44] of patients with AID, and the synovium in patients with RA [14], we know that B cells interact with T cells in lymphoid tissues and at sites of inflammation, to differentiate into autoantibody secreting PBs and PCs. At these sites, limited access to rituximab’s key effector cells, macrophages, and NK cells, may compromise depletion. Thus, antigen expression, modulation, and access to effector cells influence the efficiency of rituximab-mediated BCD. Therefore, it is important to consider both alternative target antigens and therapies that recruit other effector cells to improve BCD.",
        "CD19 regulates the threshold for B-cell activation as a co-receptor of the BCR complex [45] with consequent implications for influencing autoimmunity [46]. CD19 deficiency impairs humoral immunity, at least in part, due to an increased threshold for B-cell activation [47] whereas overexpression is associated with AID such as SLE [28]. When compared with CD19−CD20− PCs, CD19+CD20− PCs accumulate more mutations and retain greater proliferative capacity, at least in vitro [34]. These observations implicate a significant role for CD19 in B-cell differentiation and activation.",
        "When compared with CD20, B lineage cells express CD19 at an earlier stage in development and retain expression through all stages of differentiation into CD19+CD20− PBs and some CD19+CD20− PCs [28]. CD19hiCD11c+ memory B cells in humans were shown to respond robustly to antigen challenge, in vitro [48]. More recent evidence suggests that double negative (IgD−CD27−) DN B cells which express the transcription factor T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) encoded by Tbx21, termed DN-T-bet+ B cells are expanded in aging, are associated with higher mortality from COVID-19 infection and disease activity in SLE as well as disease pathogenesis in RA. Therefore they are of great interest in the field of B-cell research [49].",
        "Further, they demonstrate increased expression of CD19 which strengthens the argument to target CD19 in AID (Shah et al., in preparation). Considering the availability of newer therapies that target CD19, particularly in the field of oncology, we reappraise the concept of targeting CD19, put forward over a decade ago, to treat AID [28]. In addition, evidence from oncology highlights that cancers refractory to monoclonal antibodies have been effectively treated with CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, probably owing to the deeper depletion of B cells which provides promise for patients with AID resistant to current mAb therapy, highlighted by the published case series in SLE [50]. These mechanistic considerations indicate that targeting CD19, particularly in AID, may overcome anti-CD20 mAb resistance.",
        "Therapeutic options to target CD19+ B cells and PCs include (i) anti-CD19 mAbs; (ii) CD19-targeted CAR T cells; and (iii) CD19-directed T-cell engagers (TCE). The anti-CD19 mAb inebilizuzmab is approved for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder [51] and showed initial promising results in a clinical trial in systemic sclerosis [52]. BCD with inebilizumab was greater in transgenic mice blood and spleen as well as in an in vitro ADCC assay using human PBMCs when compared to rituximab [53]. However, similar to rituximab, anti-CD19 mAbs are also disposed to internalization [54] and would be limited by disease-associated macrophage phagocytic defects [40] and vascular access limitations. Therefore, CD19-directed CAR T cells and CD19 TCE may be of greater utility in AID and will be discussed in the following sections.",
        "The introduction of CAR T cells to treat cancer has been instrumental in providing individualized, targeted treatment through genetically engineered T cells that express a CAR specific to a tumor-associated antigen, such as CD19 in B cell [55] malignancies. Recognition of the target antigen-bearing B cells activates CAR T cells to proliferate and selectively eliminate the target B cells. The basic structure of a CAR includes an extracellular surface domain for antigen recognition (typically derived from an antibody fragment), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular signaling domain that activates T cells (typically derived from CD3z chain). The evolution of CAR from first to fourth generation includes the addition of co-stimulatory domains (one in second generation and two in third generation CARs) as well as co-expression of additional transgenes for cytokine secretion (fourth generation) [56], Fig. 4.",
        "Evolution of CARs across the generations. All CARs have a single chain variable region of a mAb. (A) first-generation CARs contain an intracellular signaling domain of CD3 zeta chain alone; (B) second-generation includes a single co-stimulatory domain (CD28 or 4-1BB); (C) third-generation CARs combine two of the above co-stimulatory domains; and (D) fourth-generation CARs are diversified in that they can express cytokines.

        "Once administered, CAR T cells can also expand and establish immune memory, thus providing long-term surveillance of disease as described in malignancy [57]. CAR T-cell therapy has been approved for the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoma, and multiple myeloma [55]. Factors such as antigen overload are considered to contribute to undesirable effects including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, leading to newer generation therapies with fewer toxicities being developed [58]. Complete remission for at least 3 years, of various relapsed B-cell malignancies was demonstrated in 51% of patients treated with CAR T-cell therapies, with few late-onset side effects [59]. This success led to CAR T cells being explored for treating refractory AID.",
        "The success of using CAR T-cell therapy for the management of B-cell malignancies inspired its research in a range of AID including SLE, myasthenia gravis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus, as outlined in Table 1. In animal models of SLE, anti-CD19 CAR T-cell treatment resulted in profound and sustained BCD with low circulating PCs and increased survival rates [60]. This data provided the basis for the use of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in the treatment of five patients with refractory multiorgan lupus which was well tolerated leading to serological and clinical remission at relatively short follow-up [50]. Probably owing to lower antigen load, the first cohort of patients with SLE-treated with anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy experienced only low-grade CRS [61], of which tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor mAb) was used (successfully) in only one patient owing to persistent fevers for 3 days [50]. Thus, current preliminary evidence suggests that CD19 targeting CAR T-cell therapy seems a safe and effective therapeutic strategy in AID such as SLE. Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy was associated with a reduction in autoantibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-α [62]. Intriguingly, despite excellent clinical responses, the authors demonstrated an increase in serum BAFF levels.",
        "With regard to other autoimmune diseases, single case studies of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy indicate a potential use of the approach also in anti-synthetase syndrome [63] and systemic sclerosis [64]. To note, an important potential confounder when appraising the mechanisms of response to CAR T-cell therapy is the use of lymphocyte depletion with fludarabine that may have contributed to the response. Several studies exploring the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in AID have been initiated (NCT05938725, NCT05869955, NCT03030976, NCT05798117, and NCT05930314).",
        "Although the case examples of anti-CAR T cells in AID are promising, it is also important to understand the limitations. Two of the five patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy had persistence of clonotypic IgG in follow-up samples, demonstrating suboptimal depletion and/or rapid repopulation of memory B cells [50]. Remarkably, despite lower antigen overload, three of five SLE patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy repopulated their B cells by day 50 after treatment [50] when compared with prolonged BCD achieved in B-cell malignancies up to several years post-infusion [55]. Potential explanations for incomplete depletion and/or relatively early repopulation of B cells include (i) complete depletion of target cells removing the sustained stimulus needed to maintain an optimal pool of CAR T cells, as CAR T cells had disappeared at week 4 after treatment; (ii) higher proportion of senescent and/or exhausted SLE CAR T cells; and (iii) potential inhibition of CAR T-cell expansion due to the persistent effects of immunosuppression such as mycophenolate mofetil beyond cessation of therapy [65].",
        "Patients with AID, particularly SLE, are often lymphopenic owing to the underlying disease process and the effects of immunosuppression, which may impact the process of leukapheresis required to generate the CAR T cells. Nevertheless, patients with active SLE in the previously discussed case series [50] were successfully leukapheresed before CAR T-cell therapy and concurrent treatment with steroids and immunosuppressive agents [66]. The process of lymphodepletion itself increases the likelihood of infections and is an additional step preceding CAR T-cell therapy, compared to “off the shelf” TCE therapy.",
        "A major consideration with CAR T-cell therapy is the risk of hypogammaglobulinemia; this may be observed with TCE but likely to a lesser extent. In the treatment of cancer, approximately a third of patients develop hypogammaglobulinemia following CAR T-cell infusion [67], owing to potent and persistent depletion of normal CD19+ B cells. Very low IgG levels can arise from 9 weeks after treatment and continue beyond 4 years [67]. This poses a risk of serious life-threatening infections, necessitating intravenous immunoglobulin infusions as a prevention strategy, as per the majority of trials [68], however, this can be expensive and not readily accessible for all patients.",
        "Importantly, B-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia result in suboptimal vaccine responses, which is also a significant concern especially in the current era of SARS-CoV-2 infection with only 29% of patients who receive CAR T-cell therapy for lymphoma/myeloma mounting a clinically relevant antibody response to vaccination [69]. Reassuringly, vaccine responses were stable following CAR T-cell therapy in the SLE case series [50], likely related to the remaining pool of CD19− plasma cells which are able to secrete antibodies 2 years post-treatment [70]. These aspects also need to be accounted for during TCE trial design in AID.",
        "Logistical limitations are also considerable. For example, in patients with rapidly progressing cancer or AID, the practical feasibility of CAR T-cell therapy may be limited as there is typically a protracted vein-to-vein time of approximately 6–8 weeks, due to the time required for producing, transporting, and ensuring quality control of the personalized cell therapy, as illustrated in the graphical abstract. This process is typical for most CAR T-cell therapies, although the novel YTB323 omits the ex vivo expansion stage (NCT05798117).",
        "Further disadvantages of CAR T-cell therapy include the high cost involved with engineering and storage of CAR T cells and the specialist training required to administer treatment as detailed in Table 2. Therefore, readily available and effective novel treatments are required while awaiting CAR T-cell therapy [79]. One approach to obviate the limiting factor of individual custom-made CAR T cells is the generation of “universal CAR T cells” as reviewed by Zhao et al. [56]. These can serve as “off the shelf” therapies to treat a wide range of clinical indications as they are engineered to target multiple antigens. Further gene editing work is underway to ensure universal CAR T cells are not depleted by the recipient’s immune system and are able to expand without causing harmful effects [80].",
        "Evidence for the use of CAR T-cell therapies in non-malignant settings",
        "To this end, we consider alternative strategies, with the potential of TCE bispecific antibodies as a novel therapeutic option to disrupt B-T cell collaboration in AID. Table 2 outlines the major differences and similarities of using CAR T-cell therapy and TCEs.",
        "TCE represents a novel class of targeted therapeutics that recruit T cells [81]. From a clinical perspective, in the late 1990s, the potential for bispecific antibodies as therapeutic interventions became clearer for cancers such as breast, leukemia, and lung [82], which led to a surge of interest in their use and FDA approval of catumaxomab for malignant ascites [83] and blinatumomab for refractory B-ALL [84] More recently, three CD20 T-cell engagers, mosunetuzumab, glofitamab, and epcoritamab have been approved for treatment of refractory/relapsed follicular lymphoma and refractory/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [85]. Technological advancements over time have enabled a range of modifications to enhance the flexibility and number of binding sites, half-life, production yield, and potency of these therapeutics [86].",
        "TCEs can be broadly categorized into (i) small, short half-life bispecific antibody fragments (single chain variable fragments) such as bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE®s) which require repeated administration (Fig. 5A); and (ii) larger IgG-based T-cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) with extended half-lives (Fig. 5B and C). The development of TCBs has evolved from single chain variable fragments in the early 1990s [87], to the development of “knobs into holes” (KiH) technology in the late 1990s [88] to the more advanced technologies including CrossMab to engineer bispecific antibodies [89, 90], Fig. 5.",
        "Selected TCE formats in a schematic representation used for T-cell redirecting therapies. (A) Blinatumomab, tandem scFv (single chain variable fragment) (BiTE) format. (B) Mosunetuzumab, IgG-based-TCE with monovalent binding using a native antibody structure with 1 Fab arm to bind CD20 (target antigen) and 1 Fab arm to bind CD3 on T cells, combined with the KiH technology as demonstrated in the CH3 domain to achieve heavy chain heterodimerization. (C) Epcoritamab, IgG-based TCE with point mutations in each Fc region (CH3 domain) to allow controlled Fab-arm exchange, termed DuoBody®. (D) Glofitamab, bivalent binding to increase the avidity of TCE binding to the target antigen, CD20, with additional KiH and CrossMabVH-VL with charge interactions using variable regions. Image created using Biorender.com",
        "Blinatumomab, a BiTE® composed of two single-chain antibodies targeting CD19 on B cells and CD3ε on T cells fused via a flexible linker (Fig. 5A), is approved for B-cell ALL [85]. It is engineered to have a short half-life of 2 h to enable tight control of serum levels in case of adverse events. Blinatumomab relies on the presence of CD19+ target cells to activate T cells, with sensitive response from CD8+ T cells to induce lysis of tumor cells as demonstrated in video-assisted microscopy studies [91]. In vitro studies of human B-lymphoma cells demonstrated a higher degree of tumor cell elimination with blinatumomab compared to rituximab [92]. Interestingly, the combination of blinatumomab and rituximab was synergistically more efficient, especially at low effector-to-target cell ratios and low Blinatumomab concentrations [92]. This combined effect was found to be due to potent activation of pro-caspases 3 and 7 in target cells, which is instrumental in triggering granzyme-mediated apoptosis. The BiTE subtype is potent with regard to target cell killing. Regardless, the requirement for repeat dosing of Blinatumomab may limit its routine use in clinical practice.",
        "Three CD20 TCE have been approved for refractory B cell lymphomas: mosunetuzumab, glofitamab, and epcoritamab [85], Fig. 5. Mosunetuzumab is an IgG-based TCE with 1:1 binding to CD20 and CD3; it uses KiH technology and in vitro assembly to overcome incorrect light chain association [93]. Epcoritamab is also IgG-based, although employs the unique DuoBody® technology with point mutations in each Fc region (CH3 domain) to allow controlled Fab-arm exchange [94]. Recent IgG-based TCEs have been developed for increased avidity. Glofitamab has two Fab regions which bind CD20, one Fab region which binds CD3 (so-called 2:1 format), and a longer half-life of 10 days, owing to its Fc region and interaction with FcRn [90]. The Fc also includes the P329G LALA mutations [81], which abolish conventional effector functions and therefore it employ a different mechanism of action compared to rituximab. The 2:1 format (Fig. 5C) enables greater potency with regard to B-cell cytotoxicity compared to 1:1 antibodies, thought to be due to the close proximity of the CD20 binder and CD3 binder, resulting in a more stable T cell to target B-cell synapse induced by the head-to-tail fusion design [95].",
        "Bispecific antibodies can redirect the effector function of various immune cells. T cells are promising as effector cells as they are abundant, able to expand rapidly, and have potent cytotoxic capacity. TCE are designed to by-pass the normal major histocompatibility complex–T-cell receptor (MHC–TCR) interaction usually required between antigen presenting cells and T cells, and instead co-engage the CD3 molecules on the T cell and form an immunological synapse via the target antigen such as CD19 or CD20 on the surface of B cells that helps redirect co-stimulation to cytotoxicity [96, 97], Fig. 6. This synapse is similar to that formed during cytotoxicity with CAR T cells. The CD20-TCE recruitment of T cells is evident in in vitro culture assays demonstrating that tumor lysis is dependent on T-cell recruitment, activation, and expansion of CD4+ and more profoundly CD8+ subsets [81]. Importantly, CD20-TCE depleted B cells in the spleen and lymph nodes, efficiently [81]. These findings may be of relevance to AID where inefficient BCD in lymphoid tissues and inflammatory sites, as discussed earlier, contributes to refractory disease.",
        "The potential effect of immunosuppressive treatments on T-cell effector function. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as per the bottom panel, results in fewer T cells to serve as effector cells for therapies such as CD19 TCE and CD19 CAR T cells. MMF can directly reduce the number of T cells and impair their activation and reduce their cytotoxicity against target B cells with lower release of perforin and granzyme molecules. Image created using Biorender.com",
        "As discussed above, in AID, B and T cells colocalize in lymphoid tissues and at inflammatory sites. Therefore, using CAR T cells or TCE that employ T cells as effector cells to deplete B cells may provide a distinct advantage over rituximab-mediated BCD that relies on macrophages and/or NK cells as the dominant effector mechanism. The key differences and similarities between CAR T-cell therapy and TCE therapy are described in Table 3.",
        "Mechanistic differences and similarities between CAR T and TCE: experience in oncology",
        "Aside from requiring lymphodepletion, an important aspect to highlight is that the expansion of CARs in vivo cannot be controlled, demonstrated by the rapid rise in circulating CARs, reaching up to 59% by day nine post-infusion [50].",
        "In addition, the expansion and duration of CAR T-cell action is not easily controlled, whereas a TCE can be given at a specific dose and the half-life of the molecule is expected to determine its duration of action. Overall, treatment with TCE may potentially overcome some of these limitations of CAR T-cell therapy such as a lag time from decision to treatment to allow for engineering of CAR T cells, prior leukapheresis, and requirement for specialist centers with experience of cell-based immunotherapies.",
        "Despite the undoubted promise of CAR T cells and TCE, there remain potential hurdles. Both CAR T cells and TCE may evoke “bystander killing” of antigen-negative cells directly in contact with antigen-positive cells [100]. While this local bystander effect is desirable in the treatment of solid tumors to prevent the escape of antigen-negative cancer cells, the potential implications of this in AID are unknown.",
        "More recently, there are an increasing number of reports of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) as a complication of CAR T-cell therapy given for hematological malignancies, possibly as a distinct variant of CRS [101]. MAS/HLH is a serious condition of hyperinflammation, fevers, and cytopenias, and can be life-threatening. Patients with autoimmune disease such as SLE are already predisposed to developing secondary MAS/HLH [102], therefore initiation of CAR T-cell therapy in this cohort needs careful consideration.",
        "Another potential pitfall with recruiting T cells as effector cells is a possible reduction in T-cell counts, which may increase the risk of infection, due to apoptosis noted with first-generation CAR T-cell treatments [103]. Reassuringly, in studies with CD20-TCB, peripheral T-cell counts decreased in the first 24 h of drug administration before returning to baseline by 72 h [81], considered to reflect an activation-induced marginalization. Therefore, the risk in the short term with these agents seems low but will need monitoring in the long term.",
        "An additional consideration is the tissue microenvironment, which is known to influence T-cell cytotoxicity. AID-related T-cell subpopulations with features of anergy, exhaustion, and senescence may compromise the efficiency of TCE [104]. In addition, resistance to TCEs may arise from immune escape, through the expression of immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-1. In this context, combination treatment with checkpoint inhibitors, already explored in cancer immunotherapy may be limited by the potential activation of autoreactive T cells [105]. Alternatively, next generation trispecific TCEs to additionally provide co-stimulation may be beneficial [106]. As CD3 is a pan T-cell marker, TCEs can recruit all T-cell populations including naïve, regulatory T cells, and exhausted T cells as effector cells. In AID, regulatory and exhausted T cells are associated with disease remission and improved prognosis [107]. Mechanistic clinical studies will help us understand the clinical relevance of these potential limitations.",
        "The main adverse effect associated with both types of T-cell therapy is CRS, which is the rapid systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, upon activation of the T cells [108]. CRS manifests as fever, fatigue, and vasodilation, and can lead to multi-organ failure. Pre-treatment with corticosteroids such as dexamethasone may reduce the risk of CRS. Anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, has been approved for use prior to CAR T-cell therapy to attenuate CRS [109]. In murine models, combination treatment with Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, restricted CD19-TCB-related CRS while retaining their efficacy [110].",
        "Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is another dose-dependent unwanted side effect unique to patients receiving T-cell engaging treatments, through adherence of T cells to cerebral microvascular endothelium and migration across the blood-brain barrier [111]. In ALL, ICANS, characterized by headache, dizziness, tremor, confusion, and encephalopathy, was associated with high-dose blinatumomab given in the first treatment cycle, probably owing to the higher tumor burden. As the target cell load is much lower in AID, the required dose of TCEs will be lower, consequently, the risk of CRS and ICANS should be lower than that reported for cancer immunotherapy.",
        "Other important considerations include AID-specific concurrent drug regimens. For example, transplant recipients and patients with AID and transplant recipients receive immunosuppressants to regulate immune response. In the context of T-cell-based therapy, concurrent use of immunosuppressants may inhibit the effector function of the T cells, thereby, compromising the efficiency of CAR T cells and TCEs. For example, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can induce apoptosis in activated human T cells [112]; and in a murine model, mycophenolic acid, the active form of MMF has shown dose-dependent reduction in the generation of cytotoxic T cells [113]. Fig. 6 illustrates the potential impact of immunosuppressants on T-cell cytotoxicity in the context of TCE and CAR T-cell therapies. Therefore withholding immunosuppressants for a period of time to allow for T-cell recovery to enhance performance may be considered in prospective trial design [114].",
        "In a case series of renal transplant recipients requiring CAR T-cell therapy for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), MMF was discontinued at the time of PTLD diagnosis (with DLBCL), and tacrolimus was stopped 2 weeks prior to leukapheresis for production of CAR T cells [73]. Similarly, a report of CAR T-cell infusion for anti-synthetase syndrome involved tapering azathioprine and steroids 7 days before leukapheresis and starting MMF 35 days after CAR T-cell infusion [76], which allowed for harvesting of fully functional T cells. This aligns with our proposition of correct sequencing of immunosuppressive treatments including the use of corticosteroids to allow full efficacy of TCE and/or CAR T therapies.",
        "Where pathogenic B-cell identity is well described, CAR T therapy can potentially enhance the prospects for personalized therapy. For example, desmoglein 3 targeting CAR T cells were engineered to selectively eliminate Dsg3 specific B cells, in vitro and in vivo in animal models [115] toward developing therapies for PV. Currently, a phase I study of BCMA CAR T therapy (NCT04561557) is ongoing for the treatment of neurological disorders including Aquaporin-related neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). However, the identity of pathogenic B cells remains elusive for the majority of AID, where non-selective BCD therapy remains the current standard strategy.",
        "In routine practice of managing AID, rituximab induction therapy incorporates two doses of 1 g, given 2 weeks apart. Retreatment with the same or lower dose of rituximab, is usually at 6 months or longer for optimal management of disease activity [17]. Current evidence highlights that response can be improved with better depletion with a lower frequency of memory B cells and PB in RA and SLE [27]. As discussed previously, presumably due to more efficient BCD, obinutuzumab treatment seems to be effective in LN [39]. To this end, targeting CD19 and disrupting the B–T-cell networking in AID, with CD19/CD3 TCEs or CAR T cells would be expected to provide mechanistic advantages. For example, targeting CD19, expressed on memory B cells, CD19+CD20−PBs, and CD19+CD20−PCs should help deplete these “rituximab-resistant cells” whereas the use of TCEs would help direct T cells from B-cell “co-stimulation to cytotoxicity” to disrupt B–T networking. Key lessons from previous SLE rituximab trials include (i) patient selection with regard to disease manifestations, severity of disease activity, serological parameters, and previous treatment are important to consider so as not to exclude the most active patients, (ii) defining standard concomitant therapy in the comparator and placebo arms as variable usage of glucocorticoid and immunosuppressants such as MMF can impact outcomes, (iii) defining endpoints in particular the steroid sparing effect, (iv) selecting the right disease activity index, and (v) defining follow-up duration and side effects. These serve as a reminder of the importance of optimal trial design to evaluate the “real” potential of TCE [25, 116].",
        "Co-therapy with immunosuppressants and/or rituximab therapy may influence the efficacy and safety of TCEs. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, patients with AID are often being treated with immunosuppression such as MMF and corticosteroids. Therefore, considering discontinuation of MMF for 3–6 weeks [50] may optimize the effector function of T cells to disrupt the B–T-cell network in AID. Thereafter, a delayed introduction of MMF may be considered as needed for optimal control of disease activity.",
        "Sequential therapy with rituximab, which is already competitively priced as a biosimilar, followed by CD19-TCE will enable targeting of B–T-cell networks in ectopic lymphoid tissue within peripherally inflamed tissues in AID, Fig. 3. A potential limitation of this sequence is that rituximab therapy may result in lower expression of CD19 [24], probably through internalization as shown in vitro [38], thus, compromising the efficiency of CD19-TCE or CD19-CAR T therapy. Therefore, treatment with CD19-TCE first followed by rituximab, as needed, could be considered as an alternative strategy for those with poor depletion with CD19-TCE alone. In this context, it would be important to have strategies to detect B cells using novel antibodies that bind an alternative epitope to the therapeutic mAbs, less challenging for CD19 as it is a bigger antigen than CD20.",
        "CD19 CAR T-cell or CD19-TCE therapy to convert B- and T-cell co-stimulation into conflict and disrupt their networking could prove to be a paradigm shift in treating AID. TCE, designed and developed through advanced antibody engineering methods, offers a mechanistically sound, logistically convenient, and favorable alternative therapeutic strategy in the management of refractory AID. To this end, mechanistic studies of TCE in AID, particularly during early-phase clinical trials, are of critical importance to optimize the use of TCE in combination with standard-of-care therapy as an alternative strategy to deplete B-lineage cells to improve outcomes for people with refractory AID.",

The success of adoptive CAR T-cell therapy for cancer has inspired researchers to expand indications into the area of solid tumors, autoimmune and infectious diseases. The most important factors influencing outcome and durability of the response after infusion of CAR T-cell are proliferation and persistence of this cell subset. It becomes therefore important to detect easily and monitor circulating CAR T-cells into blood samples. Approaches such as quantitative PCR (qPCR) or flow cytometry have been developed. The aim of this study was to set up and optimize a reachable flow cytometry technique using labeled CD19 protein for the measurement of CAR T-cells in infusion bag and patient's blood. METHODS: Patients receiving Yescarta in Cell Therapy Unit (Department of hematology, Lille university hospital, France) between April and October 2019 and healthy volunteers were included to set up the flow cytometry technique. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We assessed feasibility in clinic and suitability to routine workload of a flow cytometry technique to follow CAR T-cells in infusion bag and patient's blood. With only a few manual steps, the present protocol allows the technician to perform this technique among other routine tasks, meaning a time to results of <2 hr after sample reception.

        "With rapid progression in biomedical sciences, a number of discrete biological drug materials have been proportionally generated for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes yearly. Unlike synthesized or isolated small molecule drug products which have limited structure complexities and modification possibilities, and could directly interact with their target molecules, biologically active drugs are made by different biological materials and can cause multiple level changes in molecular and cellular levels after administration. Such drugs include, but are not limited to, countless peptides/proteins, synthesized functional RNA/DNA fragments, modified plasmids/cosmids/phages with inserted human genes, oncolytic viruses and gene delivering viral vectors, genetically manipulated human immune cells with target specificities, isolated or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with committed differentiation capabilities, and ex vivo expanded tissues. These advancements help set up a new milestone in modern personalized precision medicine[[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]].",
        "Except for some peptides, recombinant proteins, biomacromolecules, or short DNA/RNA molecules, which can either be synthesized in vitro or have a well-developed highly efficient purification/concentration process, such as affinity chromatography, vast majority of biological drugs used in gene and cell therapies need specially designed GMP grade manufacture systems for drug preparations. Depending on a drug's individual characteristics, a specific bioreactor (or “Cell Factory”) is used with a precisely controlled biological microenvironment and numerous biological raw materials for cell growth, drug preparation, and yield enhancement. In the bioreactor, biological drug templates use specific prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells as miniature cell factories for drug synthesis and production. These living cells, supporting additives and their growth/metabolic products constitute undesired impurities and must be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level prior to use. This does not include the enriched culture medium which provides a suitable environment for potential microbial co-growth and contaminations. Moreover, biological drug purification processes are challenging because the drug and different cellular contaminants share numerous similar physicochemical characteristics. Therefore, preparation of the final drug products sometimes requires multiple separation steps based on slight differences between the drug and impurities. Generally, the qualities of these drug products are evaluated for 1) identifiable impurities; 2) drug identification, concentration, and potency; 3) drug stability under different preservation and transportation conditions, including long-term stability; 4) biosimilars from different manufactured batches or manufacturers; and 5) safety of the drug[13,14]. These issues must be carefully assessed before releasing a drug. This review summarizes the common QC evaluation strategies for biological drugs manufactured in different bioreactor/cell factory systems and emphasizes the importance of individualized strategy development for each biological drug based on the Quality by Design (QbD) concept in different categories[15].",
        "The purity of the drug is the primary issue for drug quality evaluation when it is manufactured or made by bioactive cells. It can be divided into two categories: manufacture-related impurities and drug-self impurities. Most host cell impurities negatively impact drug efficacy and enhance or generate additional toxicities[16,17]. Since the manufacturing process for each biological drug is individually designed, a tailored QC assessment plan should be pre-planned based on drug characteristics, production environment and purification procedures. For prokaryotic cell-manufactured recombinant proteins and plasmid/cosmid/phage products, prokaryotic material contaminations, such as high level of endotoxins, residual bacterial proteins and DNA/RNA molecules, either released from dead cells or from lysate during drug extraction, are a serious issue and sometimes requires multiple and/or consecutive purification processes[[18], [19], [20]]. For eukaryotic cell-manufactured recombinant proteins, viruses and viral vehicles, and other biological macromolecules, the purification processes require more complex separation steps. These steps isolate the target drug from all the system contaminants including cell debris, liberated host cell proteins/DNA/RNA molecules and their degradation fragments, secreted components/micro-organelles, residual antibiotics, and potential pathogenic/oncogenic materials from human or non-human species. It is especially true for most intracellular recombinant proteins and some viral vectors which lack extracellular transport signals, and thus the drug products must be artificially released by breaking the manufacturing cells at the end of harvest[[21], [22], [23]]. A key fact that must be considered is that each purification process may potentially result in significant loss of drug products, and therefore the purification strategy needs to be carefully balanced for maximal yield of the drug. For cell-based drug products such as genetically modified Chimeric antigen receptor T (Car-T) cells and natural killer (NK or Car-NK) cells, embryonic stem cells and iPSCs, elimination of non-functional cells and aberrant differentiated cells during the expansion process is another issue that needs to be addressed and controlled[[24], [25], [26]].",
        "Accurately identifying the drug and quantifying its concentration is a key step for final drug release. For non-cell based biomacromolecules and therapeutic oncolytic viruses or gene delivering viral vehicles, the commonly used methods are specific antibody based immunological assays and quantification. Since most commercially available specific antibodies or assay kits may only recognize the primary and secondary structures of the protein immunogens, the immunological quantitation frequently includes molecules without intended functions, resulting in a common drug itself impurity issue. Functional biomolecules might vary from different manufacturing batches, even if the quantification results by the same assay indicate similar or comparable results. A typical example is Adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) quantitation using different antibodies against the same capsid proteins. The protein shell of AAV contains three distinct proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3 in a ratio of 1:1:10. All three capsid proteins are encoded by the same cap gene as proprotein with different cleavage sites but share the same amino acid sequence fragment. Therefore, only antibodies which recognize conformational structure after capsid assembly have relative quantitation values for particle number determinations[[27], [28], [29], [30], [31]]. Carefully verifying the complementary-determining region (CDR) of a selected antibody would significantly increase the accuracy of the assay for active biomolecules.",
        "For DNA/RNA-based gene materials, such as plasmid vectors, UV light absorbance at OD260 and OD280 provide a quick and accurate method for sample concentration and purity. For specific gene fragment identification in a gene delivering vector, either gene specific or viral vector specific quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) can be used for quantitative purposes. Since most inserted genes have a length greater than 1000 base pairs (bp) and the entire viral or vector genome length is usually > 3000 bp to 30,000 bp, and the designed lengths of most qPCR amplicons are often <500 bp for better amplification efficiency, a single qPCR result can only confirm the existence of a specific primer targeted portion in the product. As a common phenomenon of viral replications, a lot of viral particles are not properly transcribed/translated, assembled and packed, due to the rate differences between DNA/RNA replication and protein transcription/translation. Some viral vectors might not have any genetic materials and consist of a portion of the reagent with “empty” particles[[32], [33], [34]]. Since protein antigen based immunological assays cannot distinguish between “empty” and “full” particles, the assay may result in a large quantitation discrepancy between ELISA and qPCR results. Moreover, single qPCR cannot distinguish incomplete packed viral particles if the vectors were under-packed (one copy of ssDNA for AAV or one ssRNA for lentivirus instead of two identical copies per particle for these viruses), over-packed (multiple copies per vector) or partially packed with incomplete inserted gene[[35], [36], [37]]. These issues are a consistent challenge for correct concentration determination by routine immunological and molecular biological methods.",
        "Genetically manipulated and in vitro expanded Car-T cells or NK cells, either autologous or allogeneic, have been proved as an effective treatment for cancers and some otherwise incurable diseases. Obtaining enough cells with therapeutic functions for single or multiple treatment is an essential step [[38], [39], [40]].. Quantifying the cells with their original characteristics and therapeutic function requires a combination of several assay methods, including cytology, immunology with flow cytometry and cell functional assays. The ratio of cells with therapeutic capability should be the dominant cell population in the final product, and the aberrantly differentiated cells or the cells without appropriate markers during the expansion process should be <2 – 5 % of the population. Besides that, expanded cells are frequently fractionally packaged according to dose requirement, and cryopreserved. The freeze/thaw cycle will bring an unfavorable environment to the cells, and result in decreased viability up to 24 h[41,42]. The final cell number determination requires the cells to reach a steady status after the freeze-thaw cycle.",
        "For stem cell-based therapeutics, determination of differentiation status of the cells and ratio of the cells with therapeutic potentials in the expanded population are more important than cell number count. In vitro expanded iPSCs are frequently under the differentiation pressure and consistent changes to spontaneous terminal differentiation[[43], [44], [45]]. Even a slight change in oxygen pressure or pH in the microenvironment would alter the intracellular transcription factor expression profile and force the cells into non-directed differentiation paths. The relative expression levels and expression orders of some key pluripotent and committed differentiation biomarkers and their fluctuation during cell proliferation and differentiation have provided substantial information concerning the position of the cells in their differentiation pathway during and after expansion and also indicates their homing trends after injection[46,47]. Determination of mRNA levels of such “stem cell” markers would provide valuable parameters to determine stemness and lineage committed status of the cells. The acceptance criteria for these stem cell markers and their cross-interactions must be predefined before the expansion, and the fluctuation and ratio changes during the expansion period must be within predefined acceptable ranges.",
        "Genetically engineered biomacromolecules and intracellularly assembled viral particles generated either in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells are often not perfect with various percentages of invalid drug ingredients[[48], [49], [50], [51]]. Although these ineffective components can be detected and quantified by different immunological and molecular biological methods with the same intensity as active molecules, they do not have any significant therapeutic values for the patients and makes the dosing standardization difficult from batch-to-batch. Determining the drug bioactivity or potency is an important quality indicator. Most potency determination assays require confirmation of the therapeutic effect of the drugs in cell or tissue levels. Finding a model cell line, primary cells, or excised tissue with detectable and quantitative changes after contact with a biomacromolecule drug at a therapeutic concentration is crucial for the determination of drug potency. The detectable changes can be single or multiple related parameters. Examples include morphology, growth characteristics, gene activation, cell viability, metabolic changes, new or enhanced protein/peptide transcription/translation/secretions, etc. The quantitation results are often expressed as 50 % of the cells with appropriate reactions to the drug (EC50, IC50, or TCID50) or by specific biomarker quantitation in minimal drug concentrations. The cell-based potency quantitation assays are suitable for all the non-cell biological drugs where the concentration has already been determined by immunological and/or molecular biological assays. The potency results can be used to compare with other quantitation assays to determine the drug quality and dosage, and to determine the biosimilars of the drugs from batch-to-batch or different manufactures.",
        "When lacking a suitable cell-based potency assay, for instance, some drugs might not cause detectable changes in host cells or the changes are not significant, a more complex quantitation strategy with multiple approaches must be adapted. The results from each assay will be compared and cross-analyzed for estimated potency quantitation. For example, an AAV-based viral vector may require additional assays to determine its gene delivering efficiency, such as 1) analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and mass photometry for the determination of percentage of under-packed, over-packed and right-packed viral particles; 2) static and dynamic light scattering (SLS and DLS) for viral particle size and homogeneity; 3) electron microscopy (EM) for determination of percentage of “empty” and “full” viral particles; 4) multiple qPCR of different genome fragments for genome integrity in a particle; and 5) infectious titer determination by using receptor positive cell and gene expression analysis with flow cytometer or RT-qPCR based assays[[52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61]]. Combining different test results from all assays, or a select combination thereof, and other ex vivo experimental results, a tentative conclusion of effective titer can be derived for clinical uses. Similar strategies can also be developed for other biological drugs while a suitable potency assay cannot be as easily developed.",
        "For cell-based drugs, such as Car-T and NK cells, the cell activation and proliferation index can be determined by providing a suitable ex vivo simulation environment. The drug potency is evaluated as 1) stable activation potentials of the cells (maintaining a stable expression of incorporated genetic materials, such as chimeric ScFv in expanded progenies); 2) proliferation potential after antigen stimulation; 3) cytokine release profile including cytokine release pattern, concentrations and their ratios; 4) non-specific activation by non-target cells and lymphocyte transformation factors for target specificity, and 5) target-bearing immunodeficiency murine models. The therapeutic dose determination and potency of the reagents for all the cell-based drugs ultimately rely on in vivo testing in humans by starting at a low dose and gradually increasing to the maximum tolerated dose[[62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71]].",
        "As biological products, biomacromolecules, viruses and viral particles and in vitro manipulated cells, are extremely sensitive to harvest and purification methods, and storage and transportation conditions. Even a slight change in pH, temperature, and/or salt concentration will result in significant changes in drug potency[[72], [73], [74], [75]]. Therefore, all biological drug products after purification and dose packaging should be subjected to instant and periodical stability evaluation which includes drug appearance, pH, osmolarity, effective drug concentration and potency. It is especially important for cell-based drug products, because dead cells will release numerous intracellular compounds into the storage medium and result in cell aggregation or precipitation. As a result, these biological drugs must be dissolved and stored in an “optimal” formulation buffer in appropriate storage conditions for direct use in humans. The medium or buffer of the drug must be equal to the physiological conditions of human blood, such as acceptable pH, physiological osmotic pressure, salt composition, and free of any kind of unacceptable organic and inorganic chemicals. Spontaneous aggregation and precipitation of the drugs during low temperature storage and transportation must be detected prior to drug administration and prevented by changing the reagent conditions. Some biological drugs may need a trace amount of human albumin or other proteins as a stabilizer or carrier. Their concentration, purity, interaction potentials with the drugs, and antigenicity must be predefined and limited within acceptable ranges.",
        "A major concern for all biological drugs is the safety of humans. Unlike structure and target defined small molecules where safety and median lethal dose (LD50) can be carefully studied in small animal models prior to use, proteins, viruses, gene delivery vectors and cell based biological drugs must be tested in humans for potential therapeutic effects and safety. The animal testing data is frequently not enough or incomparable for human safety evaluation, especially for cell based therapeutic reagents. The major safety concerns include: 1) contamination of microorganisms and their toxic products, such as endotoxin, during manufacturing. 2) Antigenicity of the drugs; individual biomacromolecules, viral vehicles, and cell-based drugs would present countless antigen determinants to human recipients, especially from allogeneic sources or other species[[76], [77], [78]]. All potential immune reactions, such as native immune reactions with preformed nature antibody and complement, humoral immune reaction with specific neutralization antibody induction and cellular immunity development with potential host cell/tissue/organ damages, Cytokine storm or Massive cytolytic syndrome, must be considered and predefined for insuring immediate and long-term drug effectivities and host safety. 3) Foreign gene incorporation or recombination resulting in unexpected gene expression in the human body, especially for DNA/RNA/viral vector-based drugs. These reagents may carry the gene fragments from different viruses or manufacturing cells, such as transcription activators or antibiotics resistant genes to the host and generate unexpected non-therapeutic effects[79]. 4) Recombinant replication competent adventitious viruses, host cell oncogenes and aberrant signal transduction gene expressions. In vitro culture for cell-based therapeutic reagents may result in latent oncogene activation and tumorigenesis transformation of the cells and lead to tumor-formation after administration to the patients[80,81]. The tumorigenesis potential of the viral vectors and therapeutic cells must be identified and prevented by selected assay methods before clinical use, especially for stem cell reagents. The reagents with high possibilities for oncogene activation, expressions and tumorigenesis potentials should also be assessed in severe combined immunodeficiency murine models (nude or SCID mice)[82].",
        "All the biological drugs must meet the pharmacopeial standards, set by US Pharmacopeia (USP), European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.), and World Health Organization (WHO); and must satisfy anticipated regulatory concerns by using validated USP/FDA recommended analytic methods. The Table 1 summarizes generally used analytical assays for different biological drug categories. While some of the drug categories, such as in vitro synthesized DNA, RNA molecules and delivering lipid nanoparticles might require specific analytical methods, most drugs prepared by living cells or cellular reagents can be evaluated by some common assessment methods. Overall, the drug appearance should meet required color and clarity standards set for each individual biological drug, without any visible particles and precipitates. The pH of the drug materials must be within the physiological range (around 6 – 8) and the osmolarity of the reagents (salt + carrier protein + drug materials) should be within 280 to 330 mOms/L for cellular reagents. All the additives during manufacture and purification procedures, such as DNase, RNase, detergents, different inhibitors etc., must be removed completely or to a minimal acceptance range. All drug reagents manufactured under sterile conditions should be either free of bacterial endotoxins or within acceptance. For drug products prepared in E coli, special attention should be focused on endotoxin elimination. With repeatedly used bioreactor, E coli and other gram-negative bacterial contamination is also a frequent problem, because gram-negative bacteria tend to form a single cell layer, called biofilm, inside of the duct surface and liquid flow system and result in trace or significant amount of endotoxin contamination[[83], [84], [85]]. The minimum detection nadir of most currently used methods is around 0.01 to 0.05 EU/ml. Serial dilution of the sample will correctly identify the endotoxin concentration and determine the drug's acceptance or rejection.Table 1Quality Assessment of GMP Grade Biological Drugs for Gene and Cell TherapiesTable 1:QC Assessment CategoriesTherapeutic RNA & DNA molecules & non-viral delivering vehiclesmRNA based drug productsPlasmid vectors with DNA inserts, produced in prokaryotic cellsOncolytic virusesDNA/RNA viral vector-based gene delivering & editing reagentsTherapeutic cell reagents, including in vitro edited cell (Car-T & NK cells)Stem cells from different sources & iPSCsIdentitySpecial Analytical AssaysqPCR, RT-PCR, ddPCR for specific gene fragments & fragment analysisRT-PCR for specific gene fragments, & fragment analysisqPCR & ddPCRVirus identification by immunological & molecular biological assays, EMImmunological assay for specific vector proteins.

        "Another sine qua non test for all the biological drugs is the sterile test. Due to special features of biological manufacturing, microbial contamination is a frequently occurring problem, especially with extended culture period and multiple intervention of the culture. On the other hand, some biological drugs are also manufactured in bacterial cell factories, which can result in a large amount of bacterial genetic materials in drug products. Even with stringent or multiple purification processes, these microbial residuals are still detectable by sensitive molecular techniques[[86], [87], [88]]. The purpose of sterile testing is to confirm the reagent free of live microbial contamination and to ensure the sterility of the drugs, even trace amounts of genetic materials of microbes can be detected in the reagents. The classical sterile test is to culture the drug products in selected liquid medium at 30–35 °C and 18 – 24 °C incubators, respectively for at least 14 days to eliminate possibility of any residual live bacteria and fungi in the products. In some special situations, such as to eliminate potential inhibitory effect of bactericides/fungicides in the products or for microbial identifications, a membrane filtration method or directly streaking the samples onto different identification agar plates can be adapted accordingly. For contamination source tracking purposes, the bacterium and fungus in positive samples must be further identified by different microbial classification techniques. Some recently developed sterility tests, such as early detection of microbial proliferation, PCR, and immunological methods, are not acceptable for defining “sterile”, because the detection limit of each assay cannot meet sterile standards[89,90]. In addition, mycoplasma contamination must be excluded for drugs generated in mammalian cells and cell-based reagents before and after drug preparations.",
        "Optical characteristic of the samples is another important parameter for protein, DNA/RNA based drug products. Optical absorption of UV light at wavelengths of A260 and A280 and their ratio represents protein, DNA, RNA concentration respectively and drug purity[91]. Using SLS and DLS technology, the size and homogeneity of different nanoparticles[92] can be determined, and the drug purity can also be evaluated according to size peak distributions and relevant optical parameters. It is especially useful for protein wrapped viruses and viral vectors, such as AAV and AV vectors.",
        "Plasmid vectors with genetically manipulated sequences and inserted materials have broad uses for human medicine. The vectors can be used in vitro either by transforming/transfecting target cells to generate useful medical materials such as antibodies, cytokines, biomaterials, and oncolytic viruses/viral vectors, or by modifying the target cells for gene editing purposes[[93], [94], [95], [96]]. The vector can also be directly used in vivo for disease treatment and vaccination. Since most plasmid vectors were expanded in E coli, host cell material contamination is a major issue. In addition, the integrity of plasmid vectors and sequence correctness should be addressed appropriately as important quality indexes.",
        "Due to the fact that a significant amount of residual host cell (E coli or other prokaryotic cells) proteins in a plasmid reagent would interrupt the transfection efficiency of the drugs and cause unexpected side effects in vivo, elimination of residual host cell proteins is a necessary step for plasmid drug purification. Bacterial proteins can be digested with powerful serine proteinase or other specific proteinase to ensure the products are free of any residual antigenic and functional proteins. Routinely used quantitation methods for residual E coli proteins and exogenous proteinase are ELISA based assay systems with different polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against highly natural conserved bacterial structure proteins or total lysate proteins/specific proteinase. An effective digestion and purification process will result in a great reduction of residual host protein to minimal acceptable levels. The characteristics of residual host cell (E coli) proteins can be further determined by resolving the sample in SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining or W. Blot and/or analytical mass spectrometry[[97], [98]].",
        "Co-transfection of eukaryotic cells with residual host cell (E coli) DNA and RNA would result in unexpected transcription and translation of E coli proteins, which will greatly interrupt the cell function and transfection efficiency, even causing the death of the transfected cells. Eliminating residual host cell DNA from a plasmid reagent is hard because they share similarities with plasmid DNA and may require multiple purification steps. A commonly used residual host DNA quantitation method is qPCR-based host cell DNA amplification. The method utilizes a highly conserved E coli sequence for 23S and 16S RNA ribosome[99,100]. Some primer pairs are also non-specific for E coli only and can be used for other microbial contamination identification. The quantitation results with different primer pairs which target the same gene in different fragment regions might vary slightly depending on multiple factors that determine the PCR sensitivity and specificity.",
        "While residual host cell (E coli) RNA can be easily eliminated by specific RNase digestion, the absence of host cell RNA needs to be confirmed for drug release. Both residual host cell DNA and RNA can be visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis analysis, SDS-PAGE, or capillary electrophoresis (CE)[101]. Identified extra host DNA and RNA bands can be further semi-quantified according to their relative densities to the dominant plasmid. Ideally, residual DNA should be <10 ng/ml, and the RNA concentration should be <5 % of total plasmid DNA concentration for in vitro uses and <1 % for in vivo injection. The minimal acceptable concentration of non-plasmid DNA and RNA is, however, still controversial, especially for in vivo uses. It must be determined for each individual drug according to its characteristics and usefulness. To eliminate any unexpected side effects of the reagent, the residual host cell DNA and RNA must be fragmented, and the length of the fragments must be <200 bp.",
        "Plasmid quality plays important roles in its in vitro transformation and transfection efficiency, and in vivo efficacy. During manufacturing, some plasmid vectors suffer from bacterial endonuclease digestion and being linearized or nicked. Usually, only the supercoiled plasmid vectors can be successfully transfected into the cells and further transcribed and translated[[102], [103], [104]]. The linearized or nicked plasmid DNA will be rapidly destroyed before reaching the cell transcription machinery. The ratio of open linearized and nicked plasmid DNA to supercoiled plasmid DNA determines the plasmid quality and effective doses. Commonly used methods include analytical High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), CE, agarose gel or SDS-PAGE analysis according to the differences of each isotype in surface charge, molecular sizes, and shapes. The gel analysis results can further be semi-quantified by densitometry analysis. These analytical methods require pre-optimization with high quality calibration samples to ensure the accuracy of the results. As general acceptance criteria, supercoiled plasmid DNA should be greater than 95 % of the total sample DNA for in vitro transfection and > 99 % for in vivo use. For long-term stored samples, the spontaneous aggregation and degradation of plasmid vectors should be monitored periodically and right before use, especially for the samples stored at an out of optimal condition with low temperature, low salt, or non-physiological pH.",
        "The concentration and quality of a plasmid-based drug product is generally determined by 1) UV absorption for specific wavelengths at A230, A260, A280 and their ratios to each other. 2) ratio of supercoiled plasmid to total DNA concentration, and 3) its transformation and transfection efficiencies with different target cells (EC50 titer or dilution)[105,106]. The DNA sequence of the insertions in plasmid vectors should be analyzed prior to release to ensure the insertion has shown correct sequence and location. Entire plasmid DNA sequence should also be checked to ensure the plasmid backbone and appropriate transcription machinery were well preserved during manufacture.",
        "Many pathogenic and non-pathogenic human viruses can be reconstructed to oncolytic viruses or gene delivery vectors. Through changing viral surface ligand affinity or protein composition for specific cell surface receptor, the tropism of a viral reagent can be unique or general and can target on either dividing or nondividing cells or both for transient or permanent gene expression and editing, according to the therapeutic purposes[[107], [108], [109]]. Viral vectors have been proved to be irreplaceable gene delivering vehicles for some specific human diseases. Typically, the viral vectors can be grouped into two categories for QC assay selections. One is viral protein enwrapped DNA/RNA viruses, such as AAV and AV. Another is lipid bilayer membrane wrapped, viral protein capsid DNA/RNA virus, such as lentiviral/retroviral vectors, RSV vectors, and herpes simplex viral (HSV) vectors. All the viral vectors are manufactured in different genetically defined eukaryotic cell lines, such as insect cells, mammalian cells and non-human primate or human cells, through co-transfections of multiple plasmid vectors[110,111].",
        "The percentage of defective viruses in final viral products varies frequently from different manufacturing batches, depending on cell viability, microenvironment, nutrition exhaustion rate, waste accumulations, and many other uncontrollable factors. Even if the ratio of viral genetic materials and viral proteins is proportional by multiple quantitation methods (qPCR, ELISA, UV absorption in specific wavelengths), it does not mean the therapeutic dose decision can be made based on each individual assay or their combination[[112], [113], [114]]. It is especially true for lentiviral/retroviral and other RNA based viral vectors, because of the high replication errors in a reversed genetic information flow[115,116]. Either a reliable potency evaluation or more complex combination assays which reveal different therapeutic efficiency characteristics (e.g. mRNA synthesis of the inserts and/or protein expression quantification in susceptible cells) are needed for the determination of therapeutic doses.",
        "The viral vector genome quantitation method by qPCR or RT-qPCR requires a highly purified sample as standard to generate a reliable calibration curve to quantify the unknowns. Since all PCR primer pairs have only amplified a fragment of the target, the quantitation results for recombinant viruses and viral vectors based on single qPCR and RT-qPCR technology is often overestimated and inconsistent with the potency assay results[117,118]. Digital PCR or droplet digital PCR allocates the samples to less than one copy per reaction chamber or oil droplet and counts the numbers of chambers/droplets with PCR amplicons. With optimal serial dilutions, the percentage of positive droplets can be proportionally determined from a massive count (> 20,000 counts/sample), and the copy numbers of a target fragment in an unknown sample can be directly obtained without the need of a calibrator[[119], [120], [121]]. With further instrument improvement, like multicolor flow cytometry technology, multiple fluoresceins with different wavelengths of emission light can be detected at the same time in a single chamber/droplet. It becomes practicable to use multiple primer pairs labeled with different fluorescein dyes, simultaneously detect different portions of a single gene. Using this gene walking strategy, the integrity of recombinant vectors can be ascertained. It will further improve the accuracy of vector quantitation.",
        "Since most viral vectors and some other biological reagents are globular-shaped nanoparticles with a homogenous diameter around 20 – 200 nanometers, they would display a unique SLS and DLS pattern when light beam wavelength is much greater than the nanoparticle diameters. Based on SLS and DLS intensity and associated optical signature parameters of the particles, the relative concentration of the particles can be calculated using synthetic nanoparticles with the same diameter as a calibration[122,123]. A newly developed instrument, Stunner, combines UV and visible optical spectrum scanning and SLS/DLS measurement together, and has been used for detections and quantification of different protein enwrapped DNA or RNA viral vectors. By cross analysis of all the optical information from a viral vector product, the reagent purity, particle numbers, and other unique characteristics including empty and full ratio, particle aggregations, and small macromolecule contaminations, are correctly determined. By comparing with other methods, such as AUC, HPLC elution, and electron microscopy (EM) for Empty and Full determination, the Stunner provides a rapid, more accurate, and repeatable quantitation method for purified AAV and AV drug products. For membrane wrapped viral vectors, such as lentiviral and retroviral vector, SLS and DLS has also provided useful information for reagent purity, particle size, homogeneity and concentrations, although UV and visible light scanning has little value for particle number estimation due to unproportional light absorption by the lipid bilayer. The Stunner analysis of the samples also provides useful information for residual chemicals (iodixanol) or non-drug particles (extra light scattering peaks with particle diameters less or greater than vector sizes)[94,124,125].",
        "Residual host cell protein/DNA/RNA contamination is another major issue that needs to be addressed before drug release. When viral vectors are manufactured with mammalian or other eukaryotic cells, a number of different contaminants could be found in final drug products, which include 1) secreted components/exosomes and intracellular organelles from the host cells; 2) released or exfoliated host proteins by rapid rotation or from dead cells; 3) host cell DNA and RNA molecules with functional gene fragments; 4) infectious viral recombination during co-transfection or adventitious mammalian viruses; 5) residual accessory gene fragment of plasmid vectors with transcription efficiency, and 6) additional colloidal proteins, stimulation factors, antibiotics, chemicals and cell debris. Identification and quantitation of these unwanted contamination materials based on manufacturing processes is an important step for drug quality assessment – Identification and quantification of Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs)[[126], [127], [128], [129], [130]].",
        "An essential quality assurance test is to accurately identify and quantify the residual host and the plasmid DNA contamination with potential transcriptable gene fragments, especially for potential oncogene activities. Using commercial qPCR kits, both SV40 and E1A from plasmid vectors can be well detected and quantified. The residual host cell DNA contamination can be identified by qPCR which targets naturally conserved abundant SINEs (Alu elements), LINE-1, or gene for ribosomal RNA sequences of host genome. Because most functional genes have a sequence length greater than 200 bp, a qPCR positive result with an amplicon greater than 200 to 500 bp indicates the contamination of potential functional host genes. Therefore, the primer designs for specific DNA sequence fragments should include different lengths of the amplicons, from < 200 bp to >500 bp; and perform the assay separately or simultaneously. When all the qPCR results for amplicons greater than 200 bp have shown negative results, the reagent can be determined as free of harmful host DNA fragments, even if the result for the same sequence with a fragment length of <200 bp is positive[[131], [132], [133]].",
        "The infectivity (potency or efficacy) of oncolytic viruses and viral vectors can be determined and quantified by infection of susceptible cells in vitro with a serial dilution strategy. Target gene expression can be quantified either by virus induced cytopathic effects (CPE) or by comparing target gene expression (mRNA level) with a selected housekeeping gene, ie. relative RT-qPCR. The latter identifies the gene expression efficiency after vector transduction and eliminates the observer's bias[[134], [135], [136], [137]].",
        "With a breakthrough success in bone marrow transplantation for different hematological diseases, cell therapy has become an advanced treatment for many human diseases lately. The newly developed Car-T and NK cell therapy brings new hope for cancer eradications and therapeutic benefits for patients with severe autoimmune diseases. With rapid progress in stem cell biology, different human terminally differentiated cells can be reversed or induced to pluripotent stem cells. The iPSCs have the capabilities to repair tissue damage and age-related tissue and organ degenerations through committed differentiations. All the cell-based reagents require intensive in vitro expansion to obtain enough cells for single or multiple injections. During expansion, numerous nutritional factors, cytokines, chemicals, and human proteins are added to enhance cell proliferation and to maintain a fixed undifferentiated or committed early differentiated status[[138], [139], [140], [141], [142], [143]]. With exhaustion of the nutrition and waste accumulation in the culture medium and mitosis drifting, the cells might aberrantly differentiate and lose their original designed functions. Thus, the in vitro cultured cell products require frequent and intensive quality evaluations to confirm the drug maintains desired status and functions during the expansion.1. Cell concentration, sterility, and stability",
        "1. Cell concentration, sterility, and stability",
        "A basic requirement for cell therapy is providing accurate cell numbers with specific markers for dosage determination. Since most treatments require cell numbers greater than 107 cells per dose, and in some cases, especially for allografts, the cells are cryopreserved in small aliquots with relatively low cell numbers/mL, the cell samples often need to be pooled or in vitro expanded shortly for injection. Increased manipulation processes would raise the possibility for unexpected cell death and potential contamination by different microbes. The tests to confirm the accurate cell concentrations with appropriate cell characteristics plus rapid sterility/mycoplasma and endotoxin tests must be performed prior to the drug administration to the patients. The viable cells with specific anticipated markers in the cell suspension must be greater than 95 – 98 % to avoid potential side effects caused by dead cells. The cell stability also needs to be assessed as delayed injection can occur in some uncontrollable situations. The difference between initial cell counts after collection and the 24th hour count during the 2–8 °C storage should be <2–5 %[144,145].2. Materials and reagents for cell drug formulation and storage",
        "2. Materials and reagents for cell drug formulation and storage",
        "All the materials, medium, buffer, and anti-frozen reagents used for cell cryopreservation and expansion for final drug products should be pre-evaluated for proper salt and colloid composition, pH and osmolarity to make certain they meet normal human physiological conditions and are free of any microbial genetic materials and endotoxin. A rapid sterility test would be suitable to replace a time-consuming culture based sterile test for immediate injection, but standard culture based sterile test must be performed prior to long term drug storage. It is especially important that the Car-T cell reagents must be free of microbial material and endotoxin, because endotoxin caused toxic reactions are difficult to distinguish from cytokine storms caused by cytotoxic T cells[[146], [147], [148]].3. Cell characterization",
        "3. Cell characterization",
        "Cell characterization is required for all expanded, artificially manipulated cells and stem cells before clinical use, including their genotyping and phenotyping. For Car-T cells, the positive cells with specific surface ScFv expression and its intracellular stem should be dominant in the cell preparations by flow cytometer. The cells must present desired cytotoxic T cell characteristics, activate by specific antigen challenging, and release appropriate cytokines[[149], [150], [151]].",
        "For stem cell-based reagents, the stemness and committed differentiation stage of the cells can be defined through different stem cell factor expressions[[152], [153], [154], [155]]. More than a hundred different transcription factors and cell surface molecules have been linked to stem cell self-renewing and committed differentiation. Different combinations of transcription factor expressions indicate the stemness status of the cells and potential lineage differentiation. The relative expression of selected transcription factors compared to uniformed housekeeping gene expression predict cell positions in their differentiation pathway. For example, a cell that expresses SOX2, OCT4, and Nanog at same time indicates the cells still maintain their pluripotent stem status, but the ratio changes of these transcription factors along with other transcription factor expressions would indicate the cells starting a committed lineage differentiation. Carefully selecting specific transcription factor combinations and relevant intracellular/surface protein expressions will help to predict the destination of the cells and their therapeutic effects[156,157].4. Tumorigenesis",
        "4. Tumorigenesis",
        "Ex vivo expansion of iPSCs and other tissue-specific blast cells might have enlightened cellular oncogene activation during in vitro manipulation and extended culture and obtained tumorigenesis potentials after introduction into the human body[158]. It is especially true for patients with potent immunodepletion therapies. Evaluating the cell reagents for their tumorigenesis competency is an indispensable task, especially for stem cell based cellular drugs. Karyotypic stability, whole genomic sequencing and gene expression profiles of the cells (by mRNA expression profile) is the first step to define potential oncogenesis. With an in vitro tumor facilitating environment, such as 3D culture for tumor formation, the tumorigenesis of the cellular products can be evaluated[159]. The final exclusion of tumorigenesis potential of the cells depends on direct subcutaneous inoculation of the reagents with matrix gel onto nude or SCID mice[82,160].5. Other human pathogens and histocompatibility",
        "5. Other human pathogens and histocompatibility",
        "As a basic safety issue, some well-known pathogens inside human cells should be prescreened and excluded for allogeneic cell applications, such as HIV, HBV, HCV, HPV, retrotransposons with transcription potential and other adventitious Viruses. These human pathogens can either insert their genomic material into the host genome or serve as circular extranuclear DNA fragments and pass their genetic information to the progeny cells. It is especially important for iPSCs related implantation therapies[161,162]. For allogeneic cell therapy, pre-existing immune reactive antibodies and cytotoxic cells of the host must be prescreened prior to administration[163,164]. For this purpose, HLA typing of the cell products should be predefined, including potential development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by a reconstituted immune system[165].",
        "Due to the structure and composition complexities and specific manufacture and purification processes, the quality assessment plan and analytical methods for different biological drugs should be individually designed and rationally selected. The key factors for a drug's quality assessment include: 1) molecular structure, composition, and intracellular modification, if the drug is manufactured by the bioreactor with different cells. This includes all the peptides/proteins, DNA and RNA gene fragments, and other non-cell products. 2) The intended biological activities and their interaction targets in the levels of molecular, cellular and specific tissues, and anticipated therapeutic outcomes in humans plus potential side effects and toxicities. 3) The percentages of defective or non-perfect drug products in each manufacturing process; 4) the stability of the products during purification and long-term storage, and 5) available analytical methods for each quality concerned categories and assay limitations in exploring factual quality values of the products. For therapeutic plasmid and viral vectors, the correct backbone sequences with inserts must be defined and confirmed by sequencing analysis. Oncolytic viruses and different viral vectors need to display well assembled specific viral proteins with correct ratio, and the viral ligand for specific receptor molecules must be present on the surface of the Viruses. For genetically modified specific human cells and stem cells with committed differentiation, cell type, homogeneity, morphology with specific genotyping and phenotyping, and specific cell markers should be well defined by specific tests.",
        "Biological drug manufacturing and purification processes play important roles in drug quality. The cell factories and all the additives during the processes must be predefined for the selection of final impurity identification/quantification methods. The targeted impurities need to be effectively eliminated to an acceptable level in final drug products, according to international standards. Therefore, all selected QC assays for individual drug products must be qualified and validated periodically to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the test results. The safety of the drugs, such as endotoxin and microbial contamination, relevant side effects and toxicities of the drugs, and pre-existing or induced host immune reactions after administration, should be identified by in vitro and in vivo tests. A set of quality evaluation tests for drug identity, concentration and potency should be organized for the evaluation of batch-to-batch or lot-to-lot consistency and biosimilars.",
        "While some biological drug products might require several different analytical methods for a single quality aspect evaluation, the test results sometimes present conflicting data from each other. The final quality assessment depends on carefully weighing the pros and cons of each test method and cross analyzing all the data together to draw a correct conclusion. Reagent quality and instrument precision also contribute to obtaining reliable data. They must be regularly validated and calibrated with standard samples. With rapid progress in biological sciences, all the established QC analytical methods are subjected to periodical review for further improvement. Additionally, new test methods and instruments are constantly developed for precision analysis of the samples and elimination of potential assay limitations. These new assay methods and instruments should be evaluated and adapted to QC analytical test lists once they are confirmed and validated.",

        "The development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy was a landmark event in the field of cancer treatment, as it integrates the adaptive immune system’s functionality with precise molecular targeting. Since the first CAR-based therapies were engineered in the late 1980s [1, 2], this pioneering innovation has undergone extensive refinement and has become an integral component of contemporary oncology. Early studies of the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in treating hematologic malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, demonstrated its promise, with remission rates surpassing those achieved with conventional treatments [3]. Developing CAR T cells that are effective against solid tumors is more challenging because of several substantial barriers, including the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), antigen escape, lack of physical infiltration, and systemic cytotoxic effects, such as the induction of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity [4–6]. Nevertheless, new CAR T cells are now being evaluated in numerous clinical trials, with a focus on improving their efficacy against both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors [7]. The process used to generate CAR T cells underlies both the therapeutic promise and the challenges associated with the implementation of this technology. For example, autologous CAR T cells, which are derived from a patient’s T cells, have exhibited therapeutic efficacy but are constrained by variability in the starting material, lengthy manufacturing timelines, and patient-specific factors [8]. Efforts to reduce production time and enhance consistency, including the use of automated cell culture systems and standardized protocols, have had a positive impact; however, production limitations continue to delay the provision of timely treatment for high-risk patients. While these limitations and other logistic and economic obstacles emphasize the need for new strategies to boost the efficacy and applicability of CAR-based therapies [9], ongoing advances in CAR-based therapies suggest a future of broader clinical applicability and affordability in personalized cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current state of CAR T cell research and therapy, encompassing technological developments, clinical applications, limitations, and prospects.",
        "CAR T cell therapy was initially conceived as a technology that would enable target-specific T cell mediated cytotoxicity independent of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction via a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) specific for a tumor-associated antigen [1, 2]. A schematic illustration of the structural evolution of CAR designs across successive generations is presented in Fig. 1. The first generation of CAR T cells featured an extracellular scFv derived from an antibody to confer antigen specificity. This scFv was fused to a transmembrane domain and an intracellular signaling domain derived from CD3ζ, which mediates T cell activation through the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) [10–12]. However, these CAR T cells, which depended solely on the CD3ζ chain to mimic TCR signaling, exhibited limited proliferation, engraftment, cytotoxicity, and efficacy in clinical trials [13]. Subsequently, modifications were made to enhance their cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and proliferation in response to target stimulation. This limitation spurred the development of second-generation CARs.Fig. 1Diagrammatic representation of the structural evolution of CAR generations",
        "Diagrammatic representation of the structural evolution of CAR generations",
        "In second-generation CAR T cells, a co-stimulatory domain derived from CD28 or 4-1BB was inserted between the transmembrane and CD3ζ signaling domains. CD28 confers rapid and robust activation, it is often associated with limited persistence, whereas 4-1BB promotes long-term survival and memory formation. The dichotomy between these two signaling motifs has driven differential CAR design tailored to tumor biology and treatment goals. Notably, the first successful clinical trials involved second-generation CD19-targeted CAR T cells, with sustained therapeutic responses observed in patients with B cell leukemia [14, 15]. Consequently, in 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first CD19-targeted CAR T cells for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Currently, all FDA-approved CAR-based products employ second-generation technology [16].",
        "Third-generation CAR T cells were developed to optimize T cell activation through the incorporation of additional co-stimulatory domains. Preclinical studies have shown that third-generation CAR T cells exhibit enhanced proliferative capacity and prolonged persistence compared to second-generation CAR T cells in CD19-targeted therapies [17], and clinical trials have shown that third-generation CAR T cells demonstrate promising efficacy and reduced procedure-specific toxicity [18, 19]. However, third-generation CAR T cells have been linked to higher rates of severe adverse effects (AEs) and more rapid T cell exhaustion, which is likely due to the overactivation of co-stimulatory signaling pathways [20, 21]. In addition, this type of therapy does not result in favorable outcomes in all patients [17, 18]. In some cases, the overactivation of T cells has led to accelerated exhaustion and increased adverse events. This discrepancy underscores a critical insight in CAR engineering: more co-stimulatory signals do not necessarily equate to better efficacy, and signal tuning, rather than stacking, may be essential to optimize therapeutic outcomes.",
        "Fourth-generation CAR T cell-products include T cells redirected for universal cytokine-mediated killing (TRUCKs) [22], universal CAR T cells [23], and “armored” CAR T cells [24]. These constructs are often based on second-generation CAR T cells and feature modified intracellular signaling domains that enable cytokine secretion, which enhances T cell activation and antitumor activity [25, 26]. However, fourth-generation CAR T cells exhibit markedly reduced efficacy against solid tumors and have been associated with issues such as “on-target off-tumor” activation (TRUCKs) and unintended cytokine release in healthy tissues, resulting in systemic toxicity [27].",
        "Fifth-generation (or next-generation) CAR T cells are now under development to address the limitations of earlier constructions. Constructs are being designed to enhance the survival and antitumor efficacy of CAR T cells within the TME and to target low-antigen-density tumors and multiple antigens [28, 29].",
        "Fourth- and fifth-generation CAR T cells represent a paradigm shift toward the functional reprogramming of T cells, moving beyond conventional co-stimulatory enhancements. While these designs expand the functional scope of CAR T cells, such as through autocrine cytokine loops, inducible modules, or resistance to immunosuppressive signaling, they introduce new layers of complexity. These include risks of off-tumor cytotoxicity, uncontrolled cytokine release, and increased immunotoxicity, especially in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors where trafficking, infiltration, and persistence remain challenging. As a result, recent efforts in CAR design have shifted from simply stacking intracellular domains to developing context-responsive, tightly regulated constructs that are more adaptable to the tumor milieu. This transition from “more signals” to “better signals” reflects a conceptual evolution in CAR engineering, one that prioritizes precision, safety, and tunability over brute-force activation.",
        "Nanobody (Nb)-based CAR T cells have recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional scFv-based constructs. Nbs are single-domain antibodies derived from camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies and are composed solely of a variable heavy chain. Their small size (approximately 12–15 kDa), lack of light chains, and structural simplicity confer advantages, such as improved solubility, thermal stability, and ease of engineering, as well as the ability to target sterically hindered epitopes inaccessible to traditional scFvs [30]. The efficacy of Nbs against myeloid leukemia [31] and solid tumors, such as glioblastoma, [32] cervical cancer [33], and large solid tumors [34], has been reported in preclinical and clinical studies.",
        "In parallel with advances in the structure of CAR T cells, novel delivery platforms are being developed to boost the efficacy and application of CAR T cells. CAR gene transfer into T cells relies on two major types of delivery systems: virus-based and nonviral methods. The respective advantages and limitations of these approaches are outlined in Table 1, offering a concise comparison across critical parameters such as transduction efficiency, safety, and clinical feasibility. Complementing this, Fig. 2 provides a more detailed overview of the gene delivery landscape, including schematic illustrations of typical delivery strategies and a direct comparison of retroviral and lentiviral vectors, commonly used in clinical settings.Table 1Advantages and disadvantages associated with the different delivery platformsDelivery platformMethodAdvantagesDisadvantagesReferencesViralLentivirus- High transduction efficiency- Stable gene integration- Large transgene capacity (~ 10 kb)- Prefer both dividing and non-dividing cells- Long-term safety- High production costs- Risk of insertional mutagenesis[37, 281, 282]Gamma-retrovirus- High transduction efficiency- Stable gene integration- Simple vector design- Genomic integration risk remains- Prefers dividing cells[36, 282, 283]Adeno-associated virus (AAV)- Low immunogenicity- Long-term expression- Limited packaging capacity- Transient expression in dividing cells- Lower transduction efficiency[39, 42]Non-viralSleeping beauty transposon- Low production costs- Simplified manufacturing- Long-term expression- Random genomic insertion- Low transduction Efficiency[45, 284]Piggybac transposon- Large gene insertion- Stable integration- Insertional mutagenesis risk[55, 285]CRISPR/Cas9- Specific gene editing- High efficiency- Safe harbor integration- Off-target effects- Electroporation toxicity[69, 286]Fig. 2Overview of gene delivery methods and comparative analysis of retroviral and lentiviral vectors in CAR-T cell manufacturing",

        "Overview of gene delivery methods and comparative analysis of retroviral and lentiviral vectors in CAR-T cell manufacturing",
        "Currently, most CAR T cells are produced by transferring CAR genetic material into T cells via virus-based vectors. Gamma retroviruses and lentiviruses have been adapted for this purpose. The efficacy of gamma-retroviral vectors was first demonstrated in clinical gene therapy trials for the treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency-X1 [35], and they have proven to be effective in the generation of CAR T cells [36]. However, gamma-retroviral vectors carry a risk of oncogenesis because of their tendency to integrate into gene promoters. LVs are appealing because of their stable integration, established in vitro technology, and growing adoption in clinical applications. Compared to early-generation LVs, third-generation LVs are more efficient, have a higher genetic payload capacity, and have improved safety profiles (e.g., they do not replicate and have reduced pathogenicity) [37]. Hence, gamma-retroviral vectors and LVs are commonly used for CAR T cell generation because of their high transduction rates and long-term stable transgene expression. In addition, LVs are not restricted by cell division, enabling efficient transduction of a broad range of cell types, including noncycling, terminally differentiated cells [38].",
        "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a small, nonpathogenic, single-stranded DNA virus that has gained significant attention as a therapeutic gene delivery vector in recent years. It can efficiently transduce both dividing and nondividing cells [39], and it is widely employed as a vector for introducing genetic material into target cells to treat or prevent various diseases in clinical settings, across academia, and in industry [40]. AAV has been shown to mediate persistent transgene expression and long-term correction of disease phenotypes with minimal toxicity in both clinical and preclinical studies [41]. In a humanized mouse model of T cell leukemia, a sufficient volume of human CAR T cells capable of inducing tumor regression was generated in vivo via the injection of an AAV vector containing a CD4-specific CAR gene [42]. To date, more than 300 clinical trials involving AAV have either been completed or are ongoing [43].",
        "Nonviral delivery systems are a promising alternative to viral vectors in the generation of CAR T cells because of their higher cargo capacity and lower immunogenicity, insertional mutagenicity, and production costs. These systems facilitate either transient gene expression or stable transgene integration. While transient gene expression offers flexibility, its short-lived potency limits its use in CAR T cell therapies that require sustained in vivo expansion, memory generation, and immunosurveillance. Conversely, stable transgene integration supports longer-term therapeutic outcomes.",
        "The widely adopted Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system offers enhanced safety, scalability, and faster production compared to viral vectors [44–46]. It enables long-term gene expression across various applications, including cancer immunotherapy and genetic disease treatment [47]. For instance, SB has been used to generate anti-CD19 CAR T cells from peripheral and cord blood through plasmid DNA or mRNA delivery [48, 49]. Clinical trials with SB-engineered CAR T cells have demonstrated sustained responses in treating B-ALL and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [50, 51]. Advanced techniques, such as shortening the ex vivo culture time to two weeks and incorporating “UltraCAR-T cells” that co-express membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-15, have further improved the safety and response rates in relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ovarian cancer patients [52, 53]. Additionally, trials such as the CARAMBA trial, which focuses on multiple myeloma, continue to explore the feasibility and safety of SB-based CAR T cell therapies, reinforcing their potential in cancer treatment [54]. Nonetheless, despite its lower risk of insertional mutagenesis compared to retroviral vectors, the SB system still integrates semi-randomly within the genome, raising concerns about long-term genotoxicity. Moreover, the efficiency of SB-mediated transposition remains relatively lower than that of viral vectors, which may limit its application in rapidly progressing diseases requiring quick T cell manufacturing.",
        "The precision, efficiency, and flexibility of the PiggyBac (PB) transposon system make it a prime candidate for inclusion in CAR T cell production. Derived from Trichoplusia ni, it delivers PB transposase DNA or mRNA and a transfer plasmid carrying the genetic cargo [55–57]. Recent advances, such as optimizing CAR constructs with smaller cassettes and integrating survival-promoting cytokines, have enhanced PB-based CAR T cell therapy [57–59]. The use of the PB system in clinical trials has gained momentum, partly because of preclinical data confirming its safety and efficacy [60–63]. However, PB’s propensity to integrate into transcriptionally active regions, while advantageous for sustained expression, also poses a potential risk of dysregulating endogenous genes. Ongoing refinements such as the development of \"safe harbor\" targeting and hyperactive transposase variants aim to mitigate these risks.",
        "Nanocarriers are another promising delivery system for introducing CAR genetic material into T cells. They exhibit minimal off-target toxicity and immunogenicity, can be manufactured at scale, and can be tailored via conjugation to various biomaterials to achieve specific targeting [64]. Nevertheless, challenges such as endosomal escape, nucleic acid degradation, and limited nuclear delivery remain key hurdles that must be addressed to realize their full translational potential in CAR T cell production.",
        "Advances in gene-editing technologies (e.g., transcription activator-like effector nucleases and zinc finger nucleases) have significantly broadened their clinical applications, which now include transgene insertion to enhance therapeutic potential and precision. The CRISPR/Cas9 system stands out because of its unparalleled efficiency and versatility, enabling precise single-gene modifications and complex multiplexed editing [65, 66]. It has become a cornerstone technology in genome editing and regulation and is extensively used in genomic silencing, knock-in integration, transcriptional modulation, and other applications [67]. Various delivery methods have been developed for the transfer of DNA templates in CRISPR knock-in applications, with the use of viral vectors among the most prominent. AAV has proven to be one of the most efficient delivery systems to date [68, 69]. In terms of the CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches that utilize nonviral delivery systems, cytotoxicity remains a significant challenge. This toxicity is primarily attributed to the electroporation of double-stranded DNA and ribonucleoprotein aggregates, as well as the activation of the innate immune response via DNA sensor pathways. To address these limitations, several innovations have been introduced. For instance, incorporating truncated Cas9 target sequences into DNA templates in combination with ribonucleoproteins has been shown to improve nuclear translocation and enhance knock-in efficiency. Additionally, single-stranded DNA templates, although generally less efficient than double-stranded DNA templates, are a less toxic alternative, exhibiting up to 40% efficiency in CAR T cell production in clinical studies [70]. Further improvements have been achieved by combining these approaches with the use of transposon-based systems to enhance RNA-guided integration [71, 72]. It must also be noted that the identification and mitigation of the risks associated with genomic rearrangement and translocation, including collateral damage, are crucial and will be instrumental in driving the clinical translation of gene-editing technologies in immunotherapy. Nonetheless, unintended genomic rearrangements, off-target edits, and chromosomal translocations remain major safety concerns. Rigorous characterization of genome integrity post-editing is thus essential to ensure translational readiness of CRISPR-engineered CAR T cells.",
        "Taken together, nonviral delivery systems are not merely technical alternatives to viral vectors but represent a rapidly evolving frontier in CAR T cell engineering. As safety, regulatory control, and cost become increasingly important for scalable clinical deployment, the integration of gene editing, transposon systems, and advanced biomaterials holds the promise of ushering in the next generation of customizable, efficient, and safe CAR T cell platforms.",
        "All CAR T cell products currently approved by the FDA are second-generation CAR T cells, as summarized in Table 2 [16]. The first anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy, tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah™), was approved by the FDA in 2017 after demonstrating significant effectiveness against pediatric B-ALL in clinical trials [73]. Since then, four additional anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapies have been approved: axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta™), brexucabtagene autoleucel (Tecartus™), lisocabtagene maraleucel (Breyanzi™), and obecabtagene autoleucel (Aucatzyl™). Two anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR T cell therapies, idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma™) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti™), have been approved for use in patients with multiple myeloma [74, 75]. Carvykti™ was the first Nb-based CAR T cell therapy to be approved by the FDA (February 2022) [76]. Among these FDA-approved anti-CD19 and anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapies, two utilize gamma-retroviral vectors (Yescarta™ and Tecartus™), while the remaining five use LVs (Kymriah™, Breyanzi™, Abecma™, Carvykti™, and Aucatzyl™). Notably, all CAR T cell therapies currently approved by the FDA are limited to the treatment of specific hematologic malignancies. Given that most cancers are nonhematologic (solid) in nature [77], there are increasing efforts to develop CAR T cell therapies for solid tumors and even nonmalignant conditions.Table 2FDA-Approved CAR-T Cell Therapies (as of 2025)Product nameGeneric nameTarget antigenVector typeApproved indicationsManufacturerFDA approval yearKymriah™TisagenlecleucelCD19LentiviralPediatric and young adult B-ALL (≤ 25 years); r/r DLBCLNovartis2017Yescarta™Axicabtagene CiloleucelCD19γ-Retroviralr/r large B-cell lymphoma; r/r follicular lymphomaKite pharma (gilead)2017Tecartus™Brexucabtagene AutoleucelCD19γ-Retroviralr/r mantle cell lymphoma; r/r adult B-ALLKite pharma (gilead)2020Breyanzi™Lisocabtagene MaraleucelCD19Lentiviralr/r large B-cell lymphoma; r/r CLL/SLL (2024 label expansion)Bristol myers squibb2021Aucatzyl™Obecabtagene AutoleucelCD19Lentiviralr/r B-cell malignancies (e.g., DLBCL; recently approved in 2023–2024)Nanjing bioheng /2023–2024Abecma™Idecabtagene VicleucelBCMALentiviralr/r multiple myeloma (after ≥ 4 prior lines of therapy)Bristol myers squibb / 2seventy bio2021Carvykti™Ciltacabtagene AutoleucelBCMA (dual nanobody)Lentiviralr/r multiple myeloma (after ≥ 4 prior lines of therapy); first nanobody-based CAR-T therapyJanssen (J&J) / legend biotech2022",

        "The efficacy of CAR T cells against solid tumors remains limited. Figure 3 highlights the contrasting challenges associated with targeting hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies and compares the clinical efficacies of CAR T cell therapies developed to treat these two types of conditions. The limited efficacy of CAR T cells against solid tumors is partly a result of the restricted availability of targetable antigens, as CARs typically recognize cell-surface antigens. Additional factors include immunosuppressive TME and T cell exhaustion. Furthermore, CAR T cell therapies that target solid tumors have been shown to result in AEs because of target antigens being expressed in both tumor and healthy tissues. Nevertheless, an increasing number of phase I/II clinical trials are investigating the effects of CAR T cells specific for novel solid tumor-associated antigens [78]. Many of these trials focus on treating glioma, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer, with the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer also under investigation [16].Fig. 3The difference of clinical applications and outcomes for CAR therapy in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors",
        "The difference of clinical applications and outcomes for CAR therapy in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors",
        "Among the clinical trials registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov database (accessed May 16, 2025) that focus on CAR T cell therapies for the treatment of solid tumors, most of the trials focus on two types of tumor-associated antigens: protein antigens and carbohydrate antigens. The following paragraphs highlight selected clinical trials that exemplify these two antigen categories.",
        "The protein antigens discussed here are representative of the range of protein antigens being examined as potential targets of CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as ERBB2) is expressed on the surface of some cancer cells. It plays a key role in cancer cell growth and is overexpressed in several types of solid tumors. HER2-targeted CAR T cell therapies are currently being evaluated in six clinical trials. In trial NCT02442297, a combination of HER2-targeted antibodies and CAR T cells is being tested in patients with HER2-positive brain tumors [79]. In trial NCT02792114, the safety of HER2-targeted CAR T cells in patients with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer is being assessed to determine appropriate dosing levels In trial NCT00902044, the safety and preliminary efficacy of HER2-CD28 CAR T cells administered after chemotherapy are being evaluated in patients with sarcoma, aiming to determine whether this therapeutic approach can enhance tumor-specific targeting and effectively eliminate cancer cells without causing unacceptable toxicity [80]. In trial NCT03696030, the direct delivery of HER2 CAR T cells into the brain is being investigated as a method for treating cancers that have spread to the brain or leptomeninges [81]. In trial NCT03500991, which involves children and young adults with HER2-positive brain tumors, a new approach in which CAR T cells are delivered locally and directly to the tumor site to increase effectiveness and reduce AEs is being evaluated [82]. In trial NCT04511871, the safety and tolerability of a new CAR T cell product (CCT303-406) are being tested in patients with advanced, treatment-resistant HER2-positive solid tumors [83]. In addition, the safety, optimal dose, and preliminary efficacy of a combination of intratumoral CAdVEC (an oncolytic adenovirus) and HER2-specific CAR T cells are being evaluated in patients with HER2-positive cancers in trial NCT03740256, with the aim of enhancing the antitumor immune response via a two-pronged approach [84].",
        "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted CAR T cell therapies for solid tumors are being examined in six clinical trials: five phase I trials and one phase I/II trial. In trial NCT05341492, a single-arm, open, exploratory clinical study, the safety and efficacy of EGFR/B7H3 CAR T cells are being assessed in patients with EGFR/B7H3-positive advanced solid tumors, including lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer [85]. In the phase I trial NCT03198052, the safety and early efficacy of multi-targeted third-generation CAR T cells are being evaluated in patients with cancers expressing specific tumor antigens, including glypican (GPC) 3, mesothelin (MSLN), claudin18.2, GUCY2C, B7H3, PSCA, PSMA, mucin-1 (MUC1), TGFβ, HER2, Lewis-Y, AXL, and EGFR [86]. In trial NCT05060796, a single-arm, open-label study, the intravenous infusion of anti-EGFR CAR T cells modified by CXC chemokine receptor type 5 is being tested in patients with advanced adult non-small cell lung cancer [87]. In trial NCT06186401, the safety, AEs, and optimal dose of E-SYNC CAR T cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy are being assessed in patients with EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma [88]. In the phase I trial NCT03710421, the safe dose and AEs of CS1 CAR T cells after chemotherapy are being evaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory CS1‑positive multiple myeloma [89]. The aim of trial NCT06682793 is to evaluate A2B395, an allogeneic logic-gated Tmod™ CAR T cell product, in patients with EGFR-positive, HLA-A*02-negative solid tumors. In phase 1, the safe dose will be determined, and the tumor-killing efficacy and selectivity will be determined in phase 2. Participants will undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy before receiving A2B395 [90].",
        "MSLN is the most frequently targeted antigen in solid tumors. It has been assessed in 51 clinical trials to date, including three completed phase I trials. The safety and feasibility of MSLN-targeted CAR T cell therapies across various cancer types have been analyzed. For instance, in the phase I trial NCT02159716, CAR T cells modified to target MSLN were tested in patients with MSLN-expressing cancers [91]. Similarly, in trial NCT01897415, autologous MSLN-directed CAR T cells were assessed in patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer [92]. In another phase I trial, NCT03054298, both intravenous and local delivery of lentivirally transduced huCART-meso cells, with or without prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy, were tested to establish safety and feasibility [93].",
        "Cancer cells frequently undergo aberrant glycosylation as a result of altered expression or activity of glycosyltransferases, leading to the production of tumor-associated glycoforms that differ markedly from those found in normal tissues [94]. These abnormal glycosylation patterns are closely linked to cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis, and can generate distinct neoantigenic epitopes that are attractive targets for immunotherapy [95]. Among the most well-characterized examples are the Tn (GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr) and sialyl-Tn (STn; NeuAcα2-6GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr) antigens, which are rarely expressed in healthy adult tissues but are commonly found on the surface of epithelial tumors [96]. These tumor-specific glycoforms are not only useful as diagnostic biomarkers but also play a pivotal role in modulating immunogenicity. Glycosylation can significantly influence antigen recognition and CAR-T cell functionality. For example, it has been shown that the glycosylation status of CD19 can impact the efficacy of CAR-T cells, highlighting the need to consider glycoform variation even in canonical targets [97]. This has spurred the development of glycoform-specific CAR-T cell therapies aimed at improving tumor selectivity and minimizing off-tumor toxicity. One notable advancement in this area is the development of CARs that recognize the Tn glycoform of MUC1, a mucin protein aberrantly glycosylated in many carcinomas. The 5E5 CAR, specific for a Tn-MUC1 glycopeptide epitope, has demonstrated potent antitumor activity in preclinical models of leukemia and pancreatic cancer, successfully eliminating Tn-MUC1-positive tumor cells without affecting normal tissues [98]. Targeting such glycoform-specific epitopes not only enhances therapeutic precision but also reduces the likelihood of off-tumor effects [99]. The identification and validation of suitable tumor-specific glycoforms are thus critical to expanding the therapeutic window of CAR-T cells. The Tn-MUC1 epitope, for example, is overexpressed across various tumor types and represents a compelling target for precision immunotherapy [98]. By engineering CARs that discriminate between tumor-associated and normal glycosylation patterns, it may be possible to develop safer and more effective CAR-T cell therapies [98, 100].",
        "A distinctive feature of malignant cells is the abnormal expression of cell-surface carbohydrates, a significant trait that often receives less attention than other well-established hallmarks of cancer [101]. These aberrant carbohydrates, which differ from those in healthy cells in type, structure, or abundance, are collectively referred to as tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens [102].",
        "GPCs are heparan sulfate proteoglycans found in the extracellular matrix and on the surface of many cell types. GPC3 is expressed in a variety of solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [103], urothelial carcinoma, thyroid cancer, ovarian clear cell carcinoma, melanoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and salivary gland tumors [104]. Among the 36 clinical trials involving GPC3-targeted CAR T cells, 5 have been completed. In trials NCT03884751 [105] and NCT03980288 [106], both phase I clinical studies, GPC3-targeted CAR T cells were tested in patients with advanced HCC. The latter trial focused on a fourth-generation CAR T cell construct, with the aim of improving antitumor activity and persistence. Similarly, trial NCT03146234 was designed to assess the safety and therapeutic potential of single and multiple doses of GPC3-targeted CAR T cells in relapsed or refractory HCC patients for whom there is a lack of effective treatment options [107]. In trial NCT02395250, autologous T cells containing a GPC3-specific CAR were evaluated, with a focus on their safety and efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory HCC [108]. Finally, trial NCT02905188 was designed to assess GLYCAR T cells: GPC3-targeted CAR T cells containing a CAR derived from the GC33 antibody. This trial involved patients with advanced HCC that was recurrent, metastatic, or resistant to standard therapies, and its objectives included identifying the maximum tolerated dose, tracking the persistence of GLYCAR T cells in the body, monitoring AEs, and evaluating antitumor responses [109].",
        "MUC1 is a glycoprotein overexpressed in various adenocarcinomas, such as lung, liver, colon, breast, pancreatic, and epithelial ovarian cancers [110]. CAR T cells targeting MUC1 are currently being assessed in 13 trials, and 1 trial has been completed. In trial NCT05812326, the safety and preliminary efficacy of an immunotherapy using PD-1-knockout anti-MUC1 CAR T cells were assessed in patients with advanced MUC1-positive breast cancer [111].",
        "Disialoganglioside GD2 is highly expressed in neuroblastoma and other tumors of neuroectodermal origin [112]. Currently, there are 31 phase I and II clinical trials in progress investigating GD2-targeted CAR T cells, with 3 trials already completed. In trial NCT02765243, the safety, AEs, and appropriate dosing of a fourth-generation GD2-targeted CAR T cell product were determined [113]. In trial NCT02761915, a first-in-human study that assessed the safety and feasibility of 1RG-CAR T cell therapy, patient-derived T cells were modified to express a GD2-specific CAR and then reinfused to combat tumor cells [114]. Meanwhile, trial NCT02107963 evaluated the production feasibility and safety of anti-GD2 CAR T cells in children and young adults with GD2-positive solid tumors by utilizing escalating doses following lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide [115]. Collectively, these studies highlight the significant progress being made in applying CAR T cell therapy to improve outcomes for patients with GD2-expressing neuroblastoma.",
        "CAR T cells are also being investigated as therapeutic agents for various nonmalignant conditions, including infectious, inflammatory, fibrotic, and autoimmune diseases. For example, CAR T cell therapies developed to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection primarily target gp120, an envelope protein, and have shown promise in suppressing viral replication and targeting reservoirs of latent virions [116–118]. CAR T cells have also been engineered to treat hepatitis B virus [119, 120], chronic hepatitis C virus [121], human cytomegalovirus [122, 123], and influenza A [124] infections, as well as Epstein–Barr virus-associated malignancies [125]. They demonstrated targeted cytotoxicity or immunomodulatory effects in preclinical models. In terms of fungal infections, CAR T cells directed toward Aspergillus fumigatus were found to reduce fungal burden [126]; however, specificity remains a challenge [127].",
        "The effects of CAR T cells on allergies and asthma have also been analyzed. Immunoglobulin (Ig)E-targeted CAR T cells and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-directed CAR regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to modulate allergic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness [128, 129]. Furthermore, CAR T cells targeting fibroblast activation protein have been investigated for treating cardiac fibrosis [130, 131] and found to reduce fibrosis in mouse models [132]. Further refinement is needed to mitigate adverse inflammatory effects.",
        "Using CAR T cells to treat autoimmune diseases is a rapidly evolving and promising area. The clinical translation of research findings now spans a wide array of autoimmune conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus nephritis, systemic sclerosis, Sjögren’s syndrome, antisynthetase syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. While the precise pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases remains unclear, it is well established that the failure of T cell tolerance plays a central role, and that this leads to the activation of autoreactive B cells and the suppression of Tregs. Hence, most approaches focus on depleting autoreactive B cells. Chimeric autoantibody receptors, specialized CAR variants, have been designed to target autoreactive B cells by binding to their autoantigen receptors, thereby facilitating precise cytotoxicity while avoiding broad immunosuppression. This approach has been adopted to develop a treatment for pemphigus vulgaris, and after selective elimination of pathogenic B cells in vitro and in vivo was observed in preclinical studies, clinical trials are now in progress to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this approach [133]. Another approach involves converting CAR T cells into CAR Tregs through the introduction of FOXP3, a transcription factor crucial for Treg development and function, to restore immune tolerance. CAR Tregs suppresses autoimmune responses via mechanisms such as inducing anergy and clonal deletion, and they have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models of diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D), MS, and ulcerative colitis. In T1D models, CAR T cells targeting insulin-reactive immune cells delayed disease onset [134], whereas CAR Tregs targeting myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein effectively reduced central nervous system (CNS) inflammation in MS models [135]. CEA-targeted CAR Tregs were found to alleviate inflammation and improve survival in a mouse ulcerative colitis model, highlighting their therapeutic potential in human inflammatory bowel diseases [135]. Several lines of research focus on depleting autoreactive B cells via CD19 or BCMA targeting. For example, BCMA-specific CAR T cells are being analyzed for their efficacy against myasthenia gravis [136], a condition characterized by muscle weakness. CD19-specific CAR T cells are being evaluated for their effects on SLE [137], an autoimmune disorder that causes systemic inflammation, and CAR T cells specific for both CD19 and CD20 are being assessed for their efficacy against neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder [138]. A notable trial is also investigating CD7-targeted CAR T cells for their capacity to eliminate autoreactive T cells in Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, dermatomyositis, and Still’s disease [139, 140].",
        "Although none of the therapies directed toward autoimmune diseases have yet gained FDA approval, the emerging clinical data are encouraging. Patients have experienced sustained remission and marked symptom improvement, which are commonly associated with the depletion of autoreactive B cells and autoantibodies. Importantly, these therapies have favorable safety profiles, with most AEs being low grade and no severe CAR T cell related toxicity reported to date [140]. Collectively, these developments underscore the potential of CAR T cells to transform the treatment landscape for autoimmune diseases. They also provide valuable insights into therapy optimization, patient response dynamics, and risk mitigation strategies, thereby informing future clinical and translational advances in this rapidly evolving field.",
        "Despite the progress made in developing CAR T cell treatments for solid tumors, several challenges and obstacles remain. The efficacy and safety of CAR T cells as a treatment modality for solid tumors are limited by both intrinsic and tumor-driven mechanisms, as well as treatment-related toxicity. The major factors limiting their efficacy against solid tumors are outlined below.",
        "CAR T cell therapy, while revolutionary in treating hematologic malignancies, continues to face limitations stemming from the immunogenicity of its synthetic construct. This immunogenicity can provoke host immune responses leading to the development of anti-CAR antibodies, which may neutralize CAR T cells, accelerate their clearance, and ultimately compromise therapeutic efficacy and persistence [141, 142]. Other structural elements of the CAR, including the hinge, transmembrane, and intracellular signaling domains, can also contribute to this immunogenic profile [143]. These immune-mediated effects are clinically significant, as reduced CAR T cell persistence is associated with diminished tumor clearance and increased risk of relapse [141]. In response, several strategies have been developed to mitigate immunogenicity. These include designing fully human or humanized CAR constructs to reduce xenogeneic responses [144, 145], optimizing hinge and transmembrane domains to minimize off-target immune interactions [143, 146] and combining CAR T cell therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors like PD-1 blockade to counteract immune suppression [147, 148]. Additional approaches include dual-targeting CARs to prevent antigen escape [149], lymphodepleting chemotherapy to reduce host anti-CAR responses [150], and the incorporation of suicide genes for controllable CAR T cell elimination in the event of adverse events [151, 152]. The choice of T cell subsets, such as memory T cells, also plays a role in enhancing persistence and reducing immunogenicity [142, 153]. Moreover, novel constructs based on nanobodies are being explored for their lower immunogenic potential compared to scFv-based CARs [149]. Ongoing research continues to focus on identifying more specific tumor antigens [154], refining CAR architecture, and integrating combination strategies, such as pairing CAR T cells with oncolytic viruses or additional immunotherapies, to further enhance clinical outcomes [141, 155]. Notably, beyond immunogenicity, another intrinsic limitation of CAR design lies in the phenomenon of tonic signaling, defined as antigen-independent CAR activation, which represents a distinct but equally critical barrier to therapeutic efficacy and persistence.",
        "Tonic signaling in CAR T cell therapy refers to the spontaneous, antigen-independent activation of CAR T cells, which can result in premature exhaustion and reduced therapeutic efficacy, particularly in the context of solid tumors [156]. This phenomenon occurs in the absence of the specific antigen targeted by the CAR T cells and is often attributed to structural characteristics of the chimeric antigen receptor itself. A primary driver of tonic signaling is the instability of the single-chain variable fragment (scFv), which can induce unintended receptor activation through self-aggregation [157]. Tonic signaling undermines CAR T cell persistence and functional longevity, thereby compromising their capacity for sustained immune surveillance and long-term remission [158]. To address this challenge, ongoing research focuses on refining CAR constructs to suppress tonic signaling while preserving cytotoxic function. One major strategy involves redesigning the targeting domain. For instance, D domains—engineered receptor-ligand binding regions—can replace traditional scFvs, offering improved stability and controlled binding kinetics that reduce off-target or constitutive activation [159]. When using scFvs, optimizing their physicochemical properties is critical. Parameters such as solubility, polarity, surface charge, and electrostatic patch size on the complementary determining regions (CDRs) significantly influence the likelihood of tonic signaling [156, 159]. Affinity tuning is also essential: while low-affinity CARs may show inadequate target recognition, overly high-affinity CARs are more prone to tonic signaling and loss of specificity [160]. In addition to the targeting domain, the hinge or spacer region plays a crucial role. Modulating its length and biochemical composition has been shown to influence CAR signal strength and reduce unwanted activation [161]. Another approach involves regulating CAR expression levels using weaker or inducible promoters to prevent overexpression and receptor clustering, though this must be balanced against the need for sufficient CAR density to ensure therapeutic efficacy [162]. Furthermore, precise genomic engineering strategies such as site-specific CAR knock-in at the T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) locus have demonstrated improved receptor regulation and signaling homeostasis, thereby limiting tonic activation [163]",
        "Altogether, rational CAR design, including the careful selection and engineering of targeting domains, signaling components, and expression systems, is essential for minimizing tonic signaling. These innovations are pivotal not only for enhancing the durability and safety of CAR T cell-therapy but also for extending its application beyond hematologic malignancies to solid tumors and other challenging disease contexts [164].",
        "The human microbiome is the complex ecosystem of microorganisms found in the human body, including in the gastrointestinal tract and on the skin and mucosal surfaces. This microbial community exists in symbiosis with the host and plays a vital role in the maintenance of homeostasis and the regulation of immune functions. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the composition or function of the human microbiome, can disrupt immune responses and contribute to the development and progression of various diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, respiratory illnesses, autoimmune disorders, and cancers.",
        "More than 70% of lymphocytes transit through the gut, where they are modulated by the gut microbiota [165]. This modulation can influence immune responses and, thus, lead to enhanced cancer surveillance or the development of autoimmune diseases [166–168]. Recently, gut microbiota have been recognized as a critical factor that influences both the efficacy and toxicity of CAR T cell therapies. Notably, a highly diverse baseline gut microbial population is associated with improved CAR T cell treatment outcomes [169], and pretreatment antibiotic exposure has been linked to poor outcomes, with specific bacterial taxa (e.g., Bacteroides and Ruminococcus) identified as key predictors of the treatment response [170]. In addition, studies have indicated that modulating gut microbiota could enhance the efficacy of CAR T cells [171, 172]. These findings collectively highlight the potential of the gut microbiota as a noninvasive prognostic marker for the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy, although further research is necessary to fully elucidate its role in the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy.",
        "The selection of the target antigen(s) during the initial stages of CAR T cell therapy can be particularly challenging. Several studies have shown that many patients experience disease relapses because of antigen escape, which occurs when cancer cells downregulate or stop expressing the target antigen [173–175]. Tumor heterogeneity is another critical factor that contributes to variations in treatment efficacy, resistance, and failure [176]. Given that the antigens expressed in tumor cells can change over time and that potential target antigens are frequently expressed in normal tissues at varying levels, it is vital to develop innovative antigen selection strategies that will prevent antigen escape, enhance antitumor efficacy, and limit on-target off-tumor toxicity.",
        "The efficacy of CAR T cells as a treatment option for solid tumors relies on their capacity to reach and infiltrate solid tumors. Chemokines, chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules, vasculature leakage, and other factors all influence T cell infiltration [177, 178].",
        "In addition, infiltrating cells of various types secrete factors that contribute to the creation of an immunosuppressive TME, which allows tumor cells to escape antitumor immune processes. The immunosuppressive nature of the TME hinders the effector function of CAR T cells and thus impedes their clinical efficacy [179–181].",
        "The success of CAR T cell therapy is further hindered by the development of CAR T cell exhaustion. Persistent antigen stimulation within the TME results in increased expression of inhibitory receptors and the presence of suppressive immune cells and cytokines [182], which significantly limit the effectiveness of CAR T cells by impairing their function. Notably, ex vivo manufacturing processes have been shown to induce CAR T cell exhaustion prior to infusion. In a recent study on the generation of CAR T cells against multiple myeloma, the initial PBMCs exhibited low expression of exhaustion markers; however, TIM-3 and LAG-3 were upregulated in the final product. The majority of the CAR T cells acquired an effector memory phenotype that, despite its high cytotoxic potential, is more susceptible to exhaustion. Additionally, CAR T cells with CD28 co-stimulatory domains were found to promote strong early cytolytic responses and exhibit more rapid exhaustion than those with 4-1BB domains. These findings indicate that exhaustion is influenced not only by the TME but also by manufacturing conditions, underscoring the need to optimize CAR constructs and cell culture protocols [153].",
        "The efficacy of CAR T cell therapies is also influenced by the composition and functional quality of the CAR T cell product. Notably, the distribution of T cell subsets in the initial apheresis material plays a critical role in determining the fitness and therapeutic effectiveness of the manufactured CAR T cells. In addition, the relative frequencies of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells within CAR T cell products have been shown to significantly impact their immunological behavior and clinical performance. CD4⁺ CAR T cells are characterized by the enhanced production of Th1-type cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-2, and robust proliferative responses upon antigen engagement. In contrast, CD8⁺ CAR T cells demonstrate superior cytolytic activity against target cells. Preclinical studies have shown that a 1:1 ratio of CD4⁺ to CD8⁺ CAR T cells can elicit synergistic antitumor effects in vivo [183]. Furthermore, clinical data indicate that patients receiving CAR T cell products with a lower ratio of CD4⁺ to CD8⁺ CAR T cells exhibit improved response rates at three months post-infusion and prolonged progression-free survival. A CD4⁺:CD8⁺ CAR T cell ratio of approximately 1.12 has been proposed as a threshold predictive biomarker for clinical outcomes, indicating a slightly higher proportion of CD4⁺ cells relative to CD8⁺ cells. Interestingly, patients with lower ratios of CD4⁺ to CD8⁺ CAR T cells also had a higher incidence of neurotoxicity, suggesting a complex interplay between T cell subset composition and toxicity profiles [184].",
        "CAR T cell therapy demonstrates significant efficacy against certain refractory cancers but may cause severe or life-threatening AEs that vary individually. The two prevalent acute AEs are CRS and neurologic events, also termed CAR T cell–related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES). These AEs are generally reversible and treatable with timely interventions; however, inadequate management can lead to severe or life-threatening outcomes [185, 186]. CRS is a form of systemic inflammatory response syndrome that arises because of the proliferation of activated T cells following CAR T cell-infusion, and it occurs in about half of all patients who receive CAR T cells [187], usually within a week of cell administration [185]. When CAR T cells engage with their target antigen, they are activated and secrete large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-6, IL-1, IFN-γ, and TNF-α [186]. These cytokines further stimulate macrophages (Ms) and endothelial cells, resulting in a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammation. In CRS, they also affect multiple organ systems. A hallmark of CRS is increased vascular permeability, and “third spacing” of fluid has been observed following the “cytokine storm,” leading to vasodilation, decreased cardiac output, and intravascular volume depletion [188]. CRS symptoms range from mild fever to life-threatening multi-organ failure. Acute adverse events, including CRS and CRES, were graded according to the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) consensus criteria, which is widely adopted as the standard for CAR-T cell related toxicities. This system provides a clinically relevant and standardized framework, emphasizing objective clinical parameters such as fever, hypotension, and hypoxia for CRS, and neurologic assessment for CRES/ICANS. Unlike older grading scales, the ASTCT criteria are specifically tailored for immune effector cell therapies and offer more practical guidance for clinical intervention [189]. The grading system and recommended clinical management strategies, which emphasize early intervention with immunomodulatory therapies, are summarized in Fig. 4. Tocilizumab, an FDA-approved IL-6 receptor antagonist, is the first-line treatment and is often combined with corticosteroids. These agents are most effective when administered early in the course of CRS [190] and may also be used prophylactically in high-risk patients [191]. Multiple studies have shown that neither tocilizumab nor corticosteroids significantly impair the therapeutic function of CAR T cells [189].Fig. 4Grading criteria and clinical management strategies for acute adverse events following CAR-T cell therapy adapted from ASTCT consensus guidelines",
        "Grading criteria and clinical management strategies for acute adverse events following CAR-T cell therapy adapted from ASTCT consensus guidelines",
        "CRES is the second most frequently observed AE following CAR T cell therapy and may occur concurrently with or subsequent to CRS. It is hypothesized to result from cytokine-mediated disruption of the blood brain barrier and endothelial activation, which facilitates the infiltration of leukocytes and cytokines into the CNS. Clinically, CRES typically presents toxic encephalopathy. Early manifestations often include diminished attention, language disturbances, and impaired handwriting. As the condition progresses, patients may exhibit confusion, disorientation, agitation, aphasia, somnolence, and tremors [185].",
        "Secondary malignancies have been reported in patients who received CAR T cells. In November 2023, the FDA announced that T cell malignancies, including CAR-positive lymphomas, had been reported in patients who received BCMA- or CD19-targeted autologous CAR T cells [192]. Subsequently, several studies have explored the risk of secondary malignancies in patients treated with CAR T cell therapies [193–195]. The FDA now requires a boxed warning for T cell malignancies following treatment with BCMA- or CD19-targeted autologous CAR T cell immunotherapies [196].",
        "There is some evidence of a link between such secondary malignancies and insertional mutagenesis. This implies that the viral vector used to integrate the CAR transgene into the host T cells may inadvertently activate oncogenes or disrupt tumor suppressor genes and thus induce malignant transformation [60, 193, 197]. Although the incidence of secondary malignancies is low, the risk warrants attention, especially as CAR T cell therapies expand into earlier lines of treatment and broader patient populations.",
        "Additionally, there is emerging evidence of an association between the development of secondary lymphomas and nonviral gene delivery methods. For example, in a clinical trial that utilized PB to engineer CAR T cells for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies, 2 out of 10 patients developed lymphoma [60]. This raised significant safety concerns about the use of PB and other transposon/transposase-based gene-modification platforms. No insertion of the transgene into known oncogenes was detected, and the precise mechanism underlying the malignant transformation remains undetermined. It has been proposed that the occurrence of lymphoma might have been associated with the manufacturing process or an increase in the global copy number variations noted in the therapeutic products [198]. These findings have highlighted the lack of standardized methods for evaluating genotoxicity when nonviral gene delivery systems are used. Currently, techniques for detecting small insertions and deletions, potential off-target DNA breaks, and endonuclease-mediated translocations are under development [199].",
        "To address the risk of secondary T cell malignancies occurring after CAR T cell therapy, as well as other long-term AEs, comprehensive long-term clinical management and surveillance protocols have been implemented. Current guidelines, particularly those recommended by the FDA for gene-modified cellular products, recommend implementing extended follow-up periods of up to 15 years in both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance programs. Molecular monitoring (e.g., insertion site analyses and clonality assays) is used to detect early-stage neoplastic changes.",
        "The clinical management of patients with confirmed secondary T cell malignancies typically involves standard anti-cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, with investigational therapies considered in refractory cases [200]. The re-administration of autologous CAR T cells is contraindicated because of the risk of reintroducing malignant clones.",
        "Patient registries and real-world data are crucial for identifying risk factors, informing clinical decision-making, and improving the safety of CAR T cell therapy. The risk benefit profile of CAR T cell therapy has been evaluated by regulatory agencies such as the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, as well as through multiple clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance studies. These evaluations consistently indicate that the therapeutic benefits—particularly in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies—outweigh the associated risks, including cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Nevertheless, clinical caution remains essential, and continued investigation is needed to optimize patient outcomes and minimize adverse events.",
        "The expression of CARs in cells other than conventional polyclonal αβ T cells has been explored with the dual aims of generating more effective antitumor agents and broadening the application of CAR-based therapies. The range of cell types engineered to express CARs is illustrated in Fig. 5. Collectively, these alternative CAR-based cellular therapies provide novel platforms to overcome the limitations associated with CAR T cell therapy, particularly in the context of solid tumors, safety concerns (e.g., GvHD and CRS), and manufacturing challenges. Recent years have seen the launch of numerous clinical trials evaluating these approaches, many of which have yielded encouraging early-phase results. While most are still in early clinical stages (Phase I/II), their feasibility, safety, and initial efficacy data support the clinical potential of non αβ CAR-engineered immune cells as next-generation immunotherapies.Fig. 5CAR-based cellular",

        "Natural killer (NK) cells are a subset of innate lymphoid cells that play a critical role in the body’s defense against tumors and viral infections [201]. Because of their intrinsic antitumor properties (i.e., they do not need to undergo prior sensitization), they are promising candidates for CAR engineering [202]. Another major advantage of NK cells is that their activity is not restricted by HLA recognition, which not only contributes to their potent antitumor activity but also eliminates the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) when used in allogeneic settings [203]. By comparison, CAR T cells are often required to undergo autologous harvesting or genetic modification to avoid GvHD. Furthermore, CAR NK cells can be manufactured from pre-existing cell lines or allogeneic sources because of the lack of MHC restriction, which can result in simpler and more affordable “off-the-shelf” treatments. In contrast, CAR T cell therapy requires a patient-specific approach that is labor-intensive, costly [204], and susceptible to delays because of prior chemotherapy impairing the quality of T cells [205].",
        "CAR NK cells have been shown to effectively kill cancer cells via both CAR-dependent and CAR-independent pathways while exhibiting low toxicity, particularly in terms of CRS and neurotoxicity [206, 207]. Despite their potential, there are limitations hindering the use of CAR NK cells. First, NK cells are more resistant to viral transduction than T cells [208]. Second, NK cells have short half-lives and exhibit poor persistence post-infusion [209]. Hence, there is a potential need for repeated dosing. The findings of preliminary trials suggest that it is safe to administer multiple CAR NK-cell infusions [210]; however, data are limited, and such regimens could affect the cost-effectiveness. The results of over 50 clinical trials conducted in the past five years with CAR NK-cell therapies provide further evidence of the potential of these therapies for treating various cancers, including solid tumors. The field is characterized by cautious optimism, and further research is required to fully understand and optimize CAR NK cells as a critical component of future cancer immunotherapy strategies [211].",
        "Clinical evidence supporting CAR NK cell therapy is rapidly expanding. A landmark Phase I/II trial (NCT03056339) utilizing CD19-targeted CAR NK cells derived from cord blood reported a 73% overall response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive lymphoid malignancies, notably without CRS, neurotoxicity, or GvHD [212]. Building on these promising results, ongoing clinical trials are investigating CAR NK cells targeting HER2 (NCT03692637) [213] and NKG2D ligands (NCT05247957) [214] in solid tumors, highlighting the broad therapeutic potential of this approach across hematologic and solid malignancies.",
        "Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a small subset of αβ T cells. These cells are restricted by CD1d recognition and characterized by their invariant TCR [215]. NKT cells are particularly attractive as CAR carriers because of their capacity to infiltrate primary tumors, a feature correlated with improved outcomes across various cancer types. Like CAR NK cells, CAR NKT cells are being explored as off-the-shelf allogeneic therapeutic agents, addressing the need for readily available treatment options [216]. Additionally, their high specificity and low toxicity in both autologous and allogeneic settings are attributed to the monomorphic nature of the CD1d gene, which is expressed in limited cell types [217–220]. Notably, CAR NKT cells have exhibited stronger in vivo antitumor activity than CAR T cells, which is attributed to their CD1d-dependent elimination of immunosuppressive Ms, the promotion of spreading epitope, and the activation of endogenous T cell responses within the TME. Despite showing signs of exhaustion under a high tumor burden, CAR NKT cells can be functionally restored through PD-1 blockade and therapeutic vaccination [216, 221]. Although CAR NKT cells are still in the early stages of development, the inherent pro-inflammatory properties of NKT cells (e.g., robust cytokine production and rapid cytotoxic response) position these cells as a promising treatment option in adoptive cell therapy. A landmark first-in-human Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT03294954) [222] evaluated GD2-targeted CAR NKT cells in children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. The study demonstrated a favorable safety profile and early signs of clinical benefit, with no cases of GvHD report [223]. Expanding beyond neuroblastoma, CD70-targeted CAR NKT cells are currently being investigated in a Phase I trial (NCT06182735) for the treatment of advanced malignant solid tumors, including renal cell carcinoma [224]. Ongoing research continues to explore the potential of CAR NKT cells across a broader spectrum of solid tumors.",
        "Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are a subset of cytotoxic T cells that exhibit both T- and NK-cell phenotypes. These cells are capable of MHC-unrestricted tumor killing and are manufactured ex vivo [225]. In contrast to CAR T cells, which are generated from autologous T cells and act via MHC-restricted antigen recognition, CAR CIK cells are generated from a heterogeneous population that primarily consists of T cells with NK cell-like features. Hence, CAR CIK cells exert MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity, making them highly suitable for off-the-shelf allogeneic applications with a low risk of GvHD [226]. Additionally, CIK cells produce high levels of IFN-γ, which has been shown to reduce GvHD in mouse models [227]. Comparative studies have demonstrated that CAR CIK cells possess superior cytotoxic activity against HER2-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells in vitro and ex vivo compared to conventional CAR T cells derived from the same donors [228]. Moreover, compared to CAR T cells, CAR CIK cells have a greater proliferative capacity, a more favorable cytokine secretion profile (characterized by elevated levels of IFN-γ, perforin, and granulysin), and an enhanced capacity to activate chemokine signaling and NK cell–mediated cytotoxic pathways. While both CAR T and CAR CIK cells were found to extend survival in RMS mouse models, CAR CIK cells exhibited superior persistence and a sustained effector function in vivo, reinforcing their potential as robust alternatives to CAR T cells, particularly for targeting solid tumors [228]. In another study, anti-CD19 CAR CIK cells engineered using the nonviral SB transposon system achieved high complete response rates in patients with B-ALL without inducing GvHD or neurotoxicity [229]. Furthermore, CD33-targeted CAR CIK cells have shown efficacy against AML in preclinical studies [230]. Similarly, CAR CIK cells engineered to target HER2 were effective in treating RMS [231], while CSPG4-specific CAR CIK cells demonstrated robust antitumor activity in soft tissue sarcoma models [232]. The distinct NK cell-like phenotype of CAR CIK cells, combined with their safety in allogeneic applications and MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity, underscores their potential as cancer immunotherapy. Anti-CD19 CAR CIK cells engineered using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system were tested in a Phase I clinical trial (NCT03389035) in B-ALL, demonstrating high complete response rates with minimal toxicity, notably without neurotoxicity and GvHD [233]. Building on these results, a Phase I/II trial (NCT05869279) is currently underway to assess the safety and efficacy of Anti-CD19 CAR CIK cells in both adult and pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma [234].",
        "Gamma delta (γδ) T cells, a subset of T cells characterized by variable chains in the TCR complex, exhibit features associated with both the innate and adaptive immune systems [235]. Unlike αβ T cells, which rely on MHC-dependent antigen presentation for target recognition, γδ T cells recognize a broad range of tumor-associated and stress-induced ligands through an MHC-independent mechanism. Given that γδ T cells can eliminate cancer cells in a manner that does not rely on MHC recognition [236], they can be used to generate allogeneic off-the-shelf CAR γδ T cells with a low risk of GvHD that can target tumor cells that evade immune surveillance by downregulating MHC molecules [237, 238]. Importantly, CAR γδ T cells possess a dual-recognition capability because of the presence of engineered CARs and their endogenous γδ TCRs, which enhance their specificity and minimize off-target effects [238].",
        "Preclinical studies have demonstrated that CAR γδ T cells are effective against both hematologic malignancies, such as leukemia and lymphoma, and solid tumors, which are typically challenging to treat with conventional CAR T cells because of poor tumor infiltration and antigen heterogeneity [237, 238]. Their capacity to present antigens to αβ T cells further amplifies their antitumor response [238]. The adoptive transfer of CAR γδ T cells is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancers such as GD2-expressing neuroblastoma [239] and CD19-positive malignancies [240].",
        "Nevertheless, the clinical translation of CAR γδ T cells faces challenges, including limited in vivo persistence, inefficient expansion protocols, and potential functional exhaustion upon chronic antigen exposure. To address these limitations, multiple strategies are being explored, including developing CAR γδ T cells with co-stimulatory domains, enhancing cell survival via gene editing, using cytokines and zoledronic acid for ex vivo expansion, and using different delivery systems (e.g., garlic-derived nanoparticles or γδ T cell engagers) to improve therapeutic sustainability and functionality [238]. The results of ongoing clinical trials in which CAR γδ T cell therapies are being evaluated as treatments for various cancers, including relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies and solid tumors, indicating that CAR γδ T cell therapy has potential as a next-generation cancer immunotherapy [237, 238].",
        "CAR γδ T cells are under evaluation in Phase I trials, such as NCT04735471, for treating relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies and neuroblastoma. Preliminary findings suggest that these therapies are well tolerated, with early signs of antitumor activity and a lower incidence of immune-related adverse events [241]. Additionally, a Phase 1/2 trial (NCT06480565) is evaluating ADI-270, a CAR γδ T cell therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory clear cell renal cell carcinoma who have previously received immune checkpoint inhibitors and VEGF-targeted therapies [242]. This study aims to assess safety, cellular kinetics, immunogenicity, and antitumor efficacy.",
        "Tregs are a subset of αβ T cells that play a central role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity [243]. The lack of detailed understanding about the antigen recognition mechanisms employed by Tregs, combined with the nonspecific antigen recognition exhibited by polyclonal Tregs, limits their therapeutic potency. CAR technology provides an MHC-independent approach for directing Tregs toward pathogenic cells or affected tissues [244]. CAR Tregs are designed to enhance the suppressive function and stability of Tregs and prevent CAR Treg exhaustion. Hence, CAR Tregs and CAR T cells represent two distinct therapeutic strategies: CAR T cells are designed to activate immune responses to target cancer, while CAR Tregs are designed to suppress immune activity to treat autoimmune, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases and to promote tolerance in transplantation and gene therapy [244, 245]. CAR Tregs are MHC-independent, are less dependent on IL-2 than CAR T cells, and exhibit bystander suppression and infectious tolerance, allowing for broader application and sustainable immune regulation [244, 245].",
        "CAR Tregs have been reported to suppress B cell pathology without inducing GvHD [246], to be associated with a lower incidence of GvHD [247], and to be effective against hemophilia A [248], vitiligo [249], autoimmune encephalomyelitis [135], colitis [250, 251], asthma [252, 253], cardiovascular diseases [130], and senescence-associated pathologies [254]. There are several obstacles limiting the use of CAR Tregs, such as potential CRS, development delays due to antigen specificity, and high costs [245, 255]. Engineering solutions, such as the introduction of co-stimulatory domains, IL-2Rβ signaling, and telomerase expression, are being explored to enhance CAR Treg stability and persistence [245]. Off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR Tregs and universal CAR systems are being tested to increase accessibility [245, 255]. Data from preclinical and clinical studies support the use of CAR Tregs; however, further optimization is needed for broader clinical adoption [244].",
        "CAR Tregs are currently undergoing early-phase trials (NCT04817774) aimed at addressing immune-mediated graft rejection and promoting immunologic tolerance post renal transplantation [256], as well as in NCT05234190 for preventing liver transplant rejection after withdrawal of immunosuppression [257]. These trials, although in early stages, demonstrate the potential safety of CAR Tregs infusion. Initial biomarker data also suggest immune modulation and successful engraftment in targeted tissues.",
        "Macrophages (Ms) are a key component of the innate immune system. They play essential roles in immune defense, tissue homeostasis, and the regulation of various pathological processes [258]. The development of CAR Ms is appealing because Ms can infiltrate solid tumors, modulate the TME, and sustain prolonged antitumor activity [259, 260]. CAR Ms have been shown to recognize tumor-associated antigens, initiate intracellular signaling cascades, induce tumor cell phagocytosis, secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, upregulate MHC class I and II molecules, maintain the M1 phenotype, and stimulate adaptive immune responses [261, 262]. Collectively, these functions support a targeted and sustained antitumor response [263, 264], and CAR Ms clearly utilize a range of mechanisms to mediate their antitumor effect, unlike CAR T cells, which exert their effects mainly via direct cytotoxicity [265, 266].",
        "In head-to-head in vitro studies, CAR Ms engineered with different intracellular signaling domains (FcRγ, Megf10, or PI3K) demonstrated varying phagocytic and killing capacities, with FcRγ-based CAR Ms showing superior performance [267]. Importantly, CAR Ms can synergize with CAR T cells, as inflammatory cytokines secreted by CAR T cells induce M1 polarization and upregulate CD80/CD86 on CAR Ms, thereby enhancing the overall cytotoxic effect [267]. Despite their tumor-killing efficacy, CAR Ms have displayed more limited tumor lysis in vitro compared to CAR T cells; however, their natural effector functions (e.g., cytokine secretion) can effectively modulate the immune landscape [266]. CAR Ms also shows enhanced tumor infiltration compared to CAR T cells [266, 268]. The efficacy of these cell types is limited by similar challenges, including antigen escape and the limited availability of tumor-specific antigens [268].",
        "Compared to CAR T cells, which have been extensively studied at the preclinical and clinical levels, the use of CAR Ms is still in the early stages but gaining momentum because of promising preclinical and early clinical results [265, 268]. CAR Ms are being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials for their capacity to target HER2-, MSLN-, and GPC3-expressing tumors. Early data show that the use of CAR Ms is safe and feasible; however, further validation is required [265]. Other studies are assessing the capacity of CAR Ms to reduce tumor burden and their safety profile in patients with refractory or advanced-stage malignancies who have exhausted conventional therapeutic options, and preliminary results indicate that they effectively localize to tumor sites and exhibit sustained persistence [268, 269]. While CAR T cells exhibit superior tumor homing activity and are more amenable to systemic administration, CAR Ms have a better safety profile, with a reduced risk of CRS and potential for allogeneic off-the-shelf use [266]. Combining CAR Ms with CAR T cells and designing multifunctional CAR constructs are promising avenues for overcoming the limitations of the different cell types and improving therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of solid tumors [266, 267].",
        "The first-in-human Phase I trial of HER2-targeted CAR macrophages (NCT04660929) in patients with advanced solid tumors demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no CRS observed, and confirmed successful tumor infiltration [270]. Additionally, another study (NCT05007379) is evaluating the antitumor activity of novel CAR-macrophages using patient-derived breast cancer organoids [271]. Interesting, CAR-M therapy is being explored for hepatocellular carcinoma, targeting Glypican-3, a tumor-associated antigen highly expressed in liver cancer but absent in most normal adult tissues, making it an ideal target for HCC treatment [272].",
        "Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, an evolutionarily conserved, innate-like subset of T cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses, play a crucial role in the defense against infectious diseases [273, 274]. They are abundant in the human body and enriched at mucosal sites, such as the lungs and gut [275–277]. MAIT cells reportedly promote inflammation and mediate antitumor responses in cases of human cancer [278]. It has also been reported that MAIT cells are not alloreactive because they are not activated by classical MHC/peptide complexes and express semi-invariant TCRs. Thus, MAIT cells have potential as a source cell type for the development of an off-the-shelf CAR-based therapy. CAR MAIT cells are a viable alternative to autologous CAR T cells, as they overcome the limitation of HLA disparity and can be produced in a faster and more cost-effective manner [276].",
        "Compared to conventional CAR CD8+ T cells, CAR MAIT cells demonstrate robust cytotoxicity and lower cytokine secretion (e.g., IFN-γ, GzB, and GM-CSF secretion). This means that CAR MAIT cells may be safer and more effective than other CAR-based therapies because of a lower risk of CRS [279]. However, MAIT cells constitute only 1–10% of the T cell population in the peripheral circulation [274]. Consequently, large-scale production of CAR MAIT cells is currently limited by the availability of PBMC-derived MAIT cells, and this is hindering extensive research being conducted on CAR MAIT cells. To overcome this production barrier, it may be viable to utilize genetically engineered hematopoietic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells to generate CAR MAIT cells.",
        "Although CAR MAIT cell clinical trials are not yet registered, preclinical models demonstrate robust efficacy against various cancer types. The potential for allogeneic application, coupled with reduced cytokine release, has generated enthusiasm for advancing CAR MAIT cells into forthcoming early-phase clinical trials [278, 280].",
        "CAR-based immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies, particularly B cell-associated and relapsed/refractory cancers. It is resulting in transformative outcomes in patients who are unresponsive to conventional therapies. Building on this success, the field has rapidly advanced to now include fifth-generation CAR constructs and potential therapies based on a growing variety of cell types, such as CAR NK cells, CAR Tregs, and CAR Ms. These developments are broadening the therapeutic scope of CAR constructs beyond cancer treatment to the treatment of autoimmune, infectious, and fibrotic diseases. For instance, CAR-T cells targeting autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis have demonstrated promising results in preclinical models by selectively eliminating pathogenic immune cells, leading to disease remission. In infectious diseases, CAR-T and CAR-NK cells engineered to target viral antigens like HIV and HBV have shown potential in reducing viral reservoirs and controlling infection in animal studies and early-phase clinical trials. Despite these achievements, significant challenges remain. Therapeutic efficacy against solid tumors is hindered by antigen heterogeneity, immune escape mechanisms, and immunosuppressive TME. Additionally, severe AEs, such as CRS, neurotoxicity, and secondary malignancies, currently limit wider application. These issues highlight the need for safer, more targeted CAR constructs and toxicity-mitigation strategies. Efforts to improve CAR T cell trafficking, persistence, and antigen specificity while maintaining safety are crucial to enhancing the therapeutic sustainability of this type of therapy. Addressing manufacturing complexity and developing safe and scalable nonviral gene delivery systems are also essential to achieving broader clinical accessibility. In this review, we have summarized the evolution and current status of CAR-based immunotherapies, emphasizing their remarkable impact on the treatment and outcomes of hematologic malignancies and their promise as therapeutic agents for nonhematologic malignancies and nonmalignant conditions. Continued innovation, rigorous clinical evaluation, and technological progress will be key to unlocking the full potential of CAR-based therapies across a diverse range of medical conditions.",

    "title": "CAR-T Cells Therapy in Glioblastoma: A Systematic Review on Molecular Targets and Treatment Strategies. therapeutic options for this disease are not promising. Although immunotherapeutic techniques have shown poor success in GBM thus far despite efforts, new developments provide optimism. One of these developments is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell treatment, which includes removing and genetically modifying autologous T cells to produce a receptor that targets a GBM antigen before reintroducing the cells into the patient's body. A number of preclinical studies have produced encouraging results, which have led to the start of clinical trials assessing these CAR-T cell treatments for GBM and other brain tumors. Although results in tumors such as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and lymphomas have been promising, preliminary findings in GBM have not produced any clinical benefits. The paucity of particular antigens in GBM, their inconsistent expression patterns, and the possible immunoediting-induced loss of these antigens after antigen-targeted therapy are some possible causes for this discrepancy. The goal of this systematic literature review is to assess potential approaches for creating CAR-T cells that are more effective for this indication, as well as the clinical experiences that are already being had with CAR-T cell therapy in GBM. Up until 9 May 2024, a thorough search was carried out across the three main medical databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Relevant Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and keywords associated with \"glioblastoma\", \"CAR-T\", \"T cell therapy\", \"overall survival\", and \"progression free survival\" were employed in the search approach. Preclinical and clinical research on the application of CAR-T cells as a therapeutic approach for GBM are included in the review. A total of 838 papers were identified. Of these, 379 articles were assessed for eligibility, resulting in 8 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. The included studies were conducted between 2015 and 2023, with a total of 151 patients enrolled. The studies varied in CAR-T cell types. EGFRvIII CAR-T cells were the most frequently investigated, used in three studies (37.5%). Intravenous delivery was the most common method of delivery (62.5%). Median OS ranged from 5.5 to 11.1 months across the studies. PFS was reported in only two studies, with values of 7.5 months and 1.3 months. This systematic review highlights the evolving research on CAR-T cell therapy for GBM, emphasizing its potential despite challenges. Targeting antigens like EGFRvIII and IL13Ralpha2 shows promise in treating recurrent GBM. However, issues such as antigen escape, tumor heterogeneity, and immunosuppression require further optimization. Innovative delivery methods, combination therapies, and personalized approaches are crucial for enhancing CAR-T cell efficacy. Ongoing research is essential to refine these therapies and improve outcomes for GBM patients.

        "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive type of glial tumor, representing over 50% of all primary brain tumors in the United States, with an annual incidence rate of about 3 per 100,000 people [1]. Despite rigorous treatment plans, which include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, the median overall survival (OS) for GBM patients is only around 15 months, and the 5-year OS rate is less than 10%. The difficulty in treating GBM arises from a small population of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) that resist therapy, and the intricate inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) [2]. These GSCs play a crucial role in tumor recurrence and resistance due to their strong DNA repair capabilities, multi-drug resistance properties [3], and ability to evade the immune system. Additionally, the GBM TME promotes tumor growth and creates an immunosuppressive environment, making treatment even more challenging.",
        "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, an innovative immunotherapeutic method, has shown potential in overcoming these obstacles. CAR-T cells are designed to recognize and attack specific antigens on GBM cells, providing a highly tailored and potent treatment option. This therapy involves modifying a patient’s T cells to express CARs that specifically target antigens associated with GBM, thereby boosting the immune system’s capacity to identify and eliminate tumor cells [4]. While CAR-T cell therapy has been highly successful in treating hematologic cancers, its use in GBM is still in the preliminary stages, with ongoing clinical trials investigating its effectiveness and safety. This systematic literature review focuses exclusively on the role of CAR-T cells in GBM treatment. We will delve into the molecular mechanisms underlying CAR-T cell therapy, evaluate current clinical trial outcomes, and discuss the potential advantages and challenges associated with this approach. By synthesizing the latest research, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of CAR-T cell therapy in GBM, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape for this cancer.",
        "The systematic review adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) [5]. Two researchers (E.A. and A.G.) conducted a thorough and methodical literature exploration across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The initial search was executed on 10 April 2024, with subsequent updates made on 9 May 2024. A comprehensive search strategy was formulated using a combination of relevant keywords such as “glioblastoma”, “CAR-T”, “T cell therapy”, “overall survival”, and “progression free survival”, employing both AND and OR operators. Retrieval of studies utilized Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and Boolean logic: (“glioma” OR “glioblastoma” OR “GBM”) AND (“CAR-T” OR “CAR-T therapy” OR “chimeric antigen receptor” OR “genetically modified T”) AND (“outcomes” OR “prognosis” OR “progression free survival” OR “overall survival”).",
        "Additional relevant articles were identified through a thorough examination of references cited in selected papers. All studies were included based on specific criteria: (1) written in English; (2) clinical trials, encompassing single-arm or double-arm studies, including randomized controlled trials or non-randomized controlled trials; (3) focusing on immunotherapy strategies for glioblastoma (GBM) using CAR-T cells, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy (CT) and/or radiotherapy (RT); (4) studies that analyzed at least overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as outcomes. Exclusion criteria consisted of (1) editorials, case reports, case series, cohort studies, literature reviews, and meta-analyses; (2) studies lacking clear methodological descriptions or results; (3) studies without reported data on PFS or OS.",
        "The identified studies were imported into Endnote X9, and duplicate entries were eliminated. Subsequently, two independent researchers (E.A. and A.G.) reviewed the results against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer (P.P.P.). Eligible articles then underwent full-text screening.",
        "Each study was analyzed to extract the following details: authorship, publication year and journal, title, clinical trial phase and name, patient count, diagnosis, duration of follow-up, CAR-T therapy specifics, method of drug administration, and study outcomes.",
        "Our primary outcomes were OS and PFS related to CAR-T cell therapy.",
        "The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) [6] was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Quality assessment was performed by assessing the selection criteria, comparability of the study, and outcome assessment. The ideal score was 9. Higher scores indicated better quality of studies. Studies receiving 7 or more points were considered high-quality studies. Two authors (E.A. and P.P.P.) performed the quality assessment independently. When discrepancies arose, papers were re-examined by the third author (Figure 1).",

        "All the studies included in this systematic review are clinical trials focusing on the application of CAR-T cell immunotherapy for GBM [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. The publication years range from 2015 to 2023, with a total of 151 patients enrolled across these trials. One study was published in 2015, two in 2016, one in 2017, one in 2018, two in 2019, and one in 2023. All studies were Phase I trials, indicating the early stage of clinical research in this area.",
        "The total number of patients enrolled in these trials was 151, with the majority of studies (62.5%) enrolling 10 or fewer patients each, and the remaining 37.5% enrolling more than 10 patients. All studies targeted recurrent GBM, reflecting the focus on treating this aggressive form of brain cancer.",
        "Follow-up data were inconsistently reported across the studies, with only one study providing a median follow-up period of 24 months. The treatments investigated included various types of CAR-T cells: HER2 CMV-specific CAR-T cells, IL13(E13Y)-zetakine+ CD8+ CTL clones, IL13 Rα2-specific CAR-T cells, CAR-T-EGFRvIII+, EphA2-41BBζ T cells, and autologous GD2-specific 4SCAR-T cells. The most frequent treatment was EGFRvIII CAR-T cells, which were used in three studies (37.5%).",
        "Regarding drug delivery methods, intravenous delivery was the most common, used in five studies (62.5%), while intracranial delivery was used in two studies (25%), and one study did not provide this information (12.5%).",
        "The primary outcomes of interest were OS and PFS. Median OS (mOS) varied across the studies, with reported values of 11.1 months, 10.3 months, 7.5 months, 251 days (approximately 8.3 months), 5.5 months, 247 days (approximately 8.2 months), 6.9 months, and 10 months. Only two studies reported PFS, with one study showing a PFS of 7.5 months and another reporting 1.3 months [9,13].",
        "In summary, all studies reviewed were Phase I clinical trials, primarily enrolling fewer than 10 patients each and targeting recurrent GBM. Intravenous delivery was the most common method, and mOS ranged from 5.5 months to 11.1 months. PFS was reported in only two studies. This comprehensive analysis underscores the early-phase nature of these trials, the small patient cohorts, and the varied approaches to treatment and delivery. Despite promising outcomes in some studies, further research with larger patient cohorts and longer follow-up periods is needed to establish the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cell therapies in GBM.",
        "In Table 2 are listed the ongoing clinical trials. The ongoing clinical trials investigating CAR-T cell immunotherapy for GBM provide valuable insights into the evolving landscape of research in this area. These trials span from 2010 to 2023. The distribution of studies by publication year is as follows: 2023 (6 studies, 28.57%), 2022 (4 studies, 19.04%), 2021 (2 studies, 9.52%), 2020 (5 studies, 23.80%), 2019 (3 studies, 14.28%), and 2010 (1 study, 4.76%). They predominantly consist of Phase I trials, except for one study with an unspecified phase. In total, these trials encompass 564 patients, with the majority enrolling 31–40 patients (7 studies, 33.33%), followed by fewer than 11 patients (6 studies, 28.57%), 21–30 patients (3 studies, 14.28%), more than 40 patients (3 studies, 14.28%), and 11–20 patients (2 studies, 9.52%). All studies target glioma, with the majority focusing on recurrent GBM (76.19%). Follow-up durations vary across trials, with one study reporting a median follow-up period of 7.8 months. Various treatments are under investigation, with notable focus on B7-H3-targeted CAR-T cells (6 studies), EGFRvIII CAR-T cells (4 studies), and IL13 Rα2-targeted CAR-T cells (3 studies). Intracranial delivery methods, including intratumoral, intracerebroventricular, or intracavitary administration, are predominantly utilized, alongside intravenous delivery in some studies. The primary objectives across trials include safety, efficacy, tolerability, feasibility, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and OS. Safety assessment emerges as a common primary objective, followed by efficacy and feasibility evaluations. This comprehensive analysis highlights the diverse approaches and ongoing research efforts in Phase I trials of CAR-T cell therapies for GBM, with recurrent GBM being the primary focus of investigation.",
        "CAR-T cell therapy represents a sophisticated immunotherapeutic approach aimed at harnessing the cytotoxic potential of T cells to target and eliminate tumor cells. The fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying CAR-T cell therapy involve the genetic modification of patient-derived T cells to express CARs specifically engineered to recognize tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) [15]. The CAR construct typically comprises three main domains: an extracellular antigen recognition domain, a transmembrane domain, and intracellular signaling domains. The extracellular domain is responsible for antigen recognition and typically consists of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from an antibody specific to the chosen TAA. This scFv enables CAR-T cells to bind specifically to surface antigens expressed on tumor cells. Following antigen recognition, the intracellular signaling domains initiate downstream signaling cascades that trigger T cell activation and effector functions. The primary signaling domain is derived from the CD3ζ chain of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex, which is essential for T cell activation upon antigen recognition. Additionally, co-stimulatory signaling domains, such as CD28 or 4-1BB (CD137), are often incorporated into the CAR construct to provide secondary signaling cues that enhance T cell proliferation, survival, and cytotoxic activity.",
        "Upon binding to the target antigen expressed on tumor cells, CAR-T cells undergo activation, leading to the secretion of cytotoxic molecules such as perforin and granzyme, as well as the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). These effector mechanisms collectively result in the recognition and destruction of tumor cells by CAR-T cells [16].",
        "Studies by June et al. (2018) [17] and Maude et al. (2014) [18] provide detailed insights into the design and engineering of CAR constructs, emphasizing the importance of optimizing antigen recognition and signaling domains to enhance CAR-T cell efficacy and specificity. Additionally, research by Guedan et al. (2018) [19] and Roybal et al. (2016) [20] explores innovative strategies for enhancing CAR-T cell functionality through the incorporation of novel co-stimulatory domains and genetic modifications. This aligns with the broader literature, which highlights the growing interest and investment in CAR-T cell therapy as a promising treatment modality for various malignancies, including hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Studies by June et al. (2018) [17] and Neelapu et al. (2018) [21] discuss the remarkable clinical efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy in patients with refractory B-cell malignancies, paving the way for further exploration of this approach in solid tumors such as GBM.",
        "In addition to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CAR-T cell therapy, it is crucial to evaluate the efficacy of targeted therapies proposed for GBM using CAR-T cells. Our study sheds light on ongoing clinical trials investigating CAR-T cell immunotherapy, particularly focusing on recurrent GBM, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer known for its resistance to conventional treatments. Various targeted antigens have been identified for CAR-T cell therapy in GBM, each with its unique molecular profile and therapeutic implications. Notable targets include B7-H3, EGFRvIII, and IL13Rα2, all of which are overexpressed on the surface of GBM cells, making them attractive candidates for CAR-T cell targeting.",
        "B7-H3, also known as CD276, is a member of the B7 family of immune checkpoint molecules that regulate T cell responses. The overexpression of B7-H3 has been observed in various cancers, including GBM, where it contributes to tumor progression and immune evasion [22]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of B7-H3-targeted CAR-T cells in suppressing tumor growth and improving survival outcomes in vitro and in orthotopic and metastatic xenograft mouse models, which included patient-derived xenograft [23,24]. Clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of B7-H3-targeted CAR-T cell therapy in patients with recurrent GBM are currently underway, with promising early results reported.",
        "EGFRvIII is a constitutively active mutant form of the EGFR protein that is frequently expressed in GBM but absent in normal tissues, making it an attractive target for CAR-T cell therapy [25]. Preclinical studies have shown that EGFRvIII-targeted CAR-T cells can effectively recognize and eliminate EGFRvIII-positive GBM cells in vitro [26]. Clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of EGFRvIII-targeted CAR-T cell therapy in patients with GBM have demonstrated encouraging results, with some patients achieving durable responses and prolonged survival [10,12,13].",
        "IL13Rα2 is a cell surface receptor overexpressed in a subset of GBM tumors, particularly in the mesenchymal subtype associated with poor prognosis [27]. IL13Rα2-targeted CAR-T cells have shown promising antitumor activity in preclinical models of GBM, leading to the initiation of clinical trials to evaluate their safety and efficacy in patients with IL13Rα2-positive GBM [28]. Early-phase clinical data suggest that IL13Rα2-targeted CAR-T cell therapy may induce tumor regression and improve survival outcomes in a subset of patients with recurrent GBM [8,9]. These studies highlight the potential of CAR-T cell therapy as a promising treatment modality for recurrent GBM, offering new hope for patients with this devastating disease.",
        "The identification of predictive biomarkers for CAR-T cell therapy in GBM is another area of active research, aiming to improve patient selection and treatment outcomes. Biomarkers such as specific antigen expression levels on tumor cells, genetic and molecular profiles of both tumors and patients, and immune microenvironment characteristics are being explored. For instance, the presence of target antigens like EGFRvIII or IL13Rα2 on glioblastoma cells has been correlated with better responses to corresponding CAR-T cell therapies. Additionally, the genetic profiling of tumors to identify mutations or alterations that might influence CAR-T cell efficacy is under investigation. Immune profiling, including the assessment of immune cell infiltration and cytokine profiles within the tumor microenvironment, also offers potential as predictive biomarkers. These efforts aim to tailor CAR-T cell therapies to individual patients, maximizing therapeutic benefits while minimizing adverse effects. Further research and clinical validation are essential to establish reliable biomarkers that can guide clinical decision-making and optimize CAR-T cell therapy outcomes in GBM patients [12,13,25].",
        "It must be remembered, however, that the development and clinical application of CAR-T cell therapy for GBM have not been without challenges, particularly concerning adverse effects that have led to the halting or failure of certain trials [3,7]. Notably, several Phase I trials have encountered severe adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity, and on-target, off-tumor toxicity, which have raised significant safety concerns. For example, a trial targeting IL13Rα2 experienced severe neurotoxicity in a subset of patients, leading to its early termination. Another trial focusing on EGFRvIII-targeted CAR-T cells was halted due to instances of severe CRS, highlighting the need for more refined safety mechanisms [12,25]. These adverse events underscore the importance of developing robust strategies to mitigate toxicity, such as the incorporation of safety switches in CAR-T cell designs and improved patient monitoring protocols. By understanding the reasons behind these trial failures, future research can better navigate the complex safety landscape of CAR-T cell therapy, ultimately enhancing its therapeutic potential while minimizing risks [16].",
        "Ongoing clinical trials investigating CAR-T cell therapy for GBM, underscore the importance of comprehensive safety and efficacy assessments in optimizing treatment outcomes. These trials build upon the foundational knowledge generated from preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials, providing valuable insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of CAR-T cell therapy for GBM in real-world clinical settings.",
        "While CAR-T cell immunotherapy holds great promise for the treatment of GBM, several limitations and challenges remain to be addressed. One major limitation is the heterogeneity of GBM tumors, which can lead to variable responses to CAR-T cell therapy among patients. This heterogeneity is reflected in the diversity of antigens expressed by tumor cells, the genetic and molecular variability within and between tumors, and the differences in tumor microenvironments. The reviewed studies often had small patient cohorts, which limits the generalizability of their findings. Additionally, inconsistent follow-up durations across trials make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the long-term efficacy and safety of CAR-T cell therapies.",
        "Another critical limitation is the variability in the findings of the studies analyzed. Differences in CAR-T cell constructs, delivery methods, patient selection criteria, and clinical endpoints contribute to the diverse range of outcomes reported. This variability complicates the ability to draw definitive conclusions and underscores the need for standardized methodologies in future research. The inconsistency in study designs and endpoints highlights the necessity for larger, more uniform trials to provide clearer insights into the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cell therapy for GBM.",
        "The hostile tumor microenvironment of GBM, characterized by immunosuppressive factors and physical barriers such as the blood-brain barrier, poses significant challenges to the effective trafficking and infiltration of CAR-T cells into the tumor site. Moreover, the potential for on-target, off-tumor toxicity remains a concern, particularly when targeting antigens expressed at low levels in normal tissues. The reviewed studies highlighted instances of neurotoxicity and cytokine release syndrome, which underscore the need for improved safety mechanisms.",
        "To overcome these limitations, future research efforts should focus on several key areas: (1) enhancing target specificity: identifying novel CAR-T cell targets that are highly specific to GBM cells while minimizing off-target effects is crucial. This includes the development of dual-targeting CAR-T cells that require the presence of two antigens for activation, thereby reducing the risk of attacking healthy tissues; (2) improving tumor infiltration: strategies to enhance the trafficking and infiltration of CAR-T cells into the GBM tumor microenvironment are needed. This could involve the use of adjuvant therapies that modulate the tumor microenvironment to be more conducive to CAR-T cell activity, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors or agents that disrupt the physical barriers of the tumor; (3) combining therapies: the development of combinatorial treatment approaches incorporating CAR-T cell therapy with other modalities such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies, and radiation therapy holds promise for enhancing therapeutic efficacy and overcoming resistance mechanisms; (4) optimizing CAR-T design: advancements in CAR-T cell engineering, including the incorporation of safety switches, optimization of CAR design, and the use of synthetic biology to control CAR-T cell functions, may further improve the safety profile and clinical outcomes of CAR-T cell therapy for GBM; (5) conducting larger, multicenter trials: to validate the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cell therapies, larger, multicenter clinical trials with standardized protocols and longer follow-up periods are essential. These trials should aim to include diverse patient populations to ensure the findings are broadly applicable [29,30].",
        "This systematic review of the literature on CAR-T cell immunotherapy for glioblastoma reveals a dynamic and evolving landscape of research aimed at addressing the formidable challenges posed by this aggressive brain tumor. Molecular mechanisms underlying CAR-T cell therapy underscore the intricate interplay between engineered T cells and tumor cells, with emphasis on antigen recognition, activation, and cytotoxicity. Targeted therapies employing CAR-T cells, particularly those targeting B7-H3, EGFRvIII, and IL13Rα2, demonstrate promising results in preclinical and clinical settings, highlighting their potential as novel treatment modalities for recurrent glioblastoma. However, challenges such as antigen escape, tumor heterogeneity, and immunosuppressive microenvironment necessitate further optimization and refinement of CAR-T cell therapies. Integration of innovative delivery methods, combination therapies, and personalized approaches holds immense promise in harnessing the full potential of CAR-T cell immunotherapy for improving outcomes in patients with glioblastoma. Continued research efforts aimed at elucidating molecular mechanisms, optimizing treatment protocols, and addressing therapeutic limitations are imperative for advancing the field toward achieving meaningful clinical outcomes and ultimately improving the prognosis for patients with this disease.",

        "Chimeric antigen receptor modified T‐cell (CAR‐T) therapy represents a novel treatment for patients with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) large B‐cell lymphoma (LBCL). Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi‐cel) followed shortly by tisagenlecleucel (tisa‐cel) were the first to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval for patients with R/R LBCL who had failed 2 or more lines of systemic therapy [1, 2, 3]. Long‐term follow‐up data confirms remissions lasting 3 years and beyond for approximately 40% of such patients after CAR‐T therapy [4]. Recently, lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso‐cel) was approved for LBCL in third or later line [5]. Objective response (OR) was achieved in 73% with complete remission (CR) in 53%. Notably grade ≥3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological adverse events (NAEs) were seen in only 2% and 10% patients, respectively, [5].",
        "The remarkable efficacy and manageable toxicity in a patient population that previously had dismal outcomes has not only led to significant expansion of CAR‐T across other disease subtypes, but it has also led to the development of new platforms of CAR‐T delivery. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) are both heterogeneous B‐cell non‐Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) that are considered incurable with standard chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) [6, 7]. CAR‐T with brexucabtagene (brexu‐cel) and axi‐cel is now commercially available for R/R MCL and FL respectively.<COMP: Please set Reference citations as per the journal style.>",
        "In this review, we discuss new indications for CAR‐T in NHL beyond LBCL. We also discuss emerging experimental platforms of CAR‐T in lymphomas that are expected to challenge our current clinical practices.",
        "MCL comprises about 6% of all adult NHL and is generally aggressive in its clinical presentation although a subset present with an indolent clinical course [8, 9, 10]. Younger symptomatic, advanced disease patients are typically offered upfront intensive systemic CIT [6]. This is followed by a consolidative autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (auto‐HCT) and rituximab maintenance, although intensive CIT regimens without an auto‐HCT have also shown comparable outcomes [11, 12, 13]. Despite intensive upfront treatment, long‐term follow‐up confirms a continuous pattern of relapse with outcomes particularly poor for patients relapsing early after auto‐HCT [14, 15].",
        "Significant progress has been made in MCL relapsing after front line CIT with the approval of multiple novel chemotherapy free treatments. Most notable are the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor inhibitors (BTKi) [16, 17, 18]. Despite initial high responses with BTKi the disease remains incurable with median progression‐free survival (PFS) of around 1 year [19]. Outcomes are particularly poor for patients relapsing after BTKi with a median overall survival (OS) of under 6 months, representing a strong clinical need for new treatments [20, 21].",
        "ZUMA‐2 trial led to the approval of brexu‐cel, the first and currently the only approved CAR‐T for patients with R/R MCL. Brexu‐cel is a CD‐19‐directed auto‐CAR‐T with a CD3ζ signaling domain and a CD28 costimulatory domain [22]. In the pivotal trial 74 patients were enrolled, brexu‐cel was manufactured successfully for 71 (96%) and administered to 68 (92%) [22]. Included patients had previously received an anthracycline or bendamustine containing chemotherapy in combination with an anti‐CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and a BTKi. Median age was 68 (range: 38–79), high‐risk prognostic features were common including blastoid morphology (n = 21, 31%), Ki67 ≥30% (n = 40, 82%) and TP53 mutation (n = 6, 17%). Bridging therapy (BT) was administered to 25 patients (37%) [22]. Among the enrolled population, 85% had an OR with 59% achieving CR [22]. Notably, a positive correlation between expansion of CAR‐T and disease response was observed, consistent with prior studies [1]. The estimated PFS and OS at 12 months was at 61% and 83%, respectively [22]. Most common grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) were cytopenias (94%) followed by infections (32%) [22]. CRS was reported in 91% with grade ≥3 CRS in 15% (Lee criteria) and NAEs were reported in 63% with grade ≥3 NAE in 31% (Table 1).",

        "Liso‐cel is another CD19‐directed CAR‐T with a CD3ζ signaling domain and a 4‐1BB costimulatory domain [5]. During manufacturing of liso‐cel, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are separated from the leukapheresis product and thereafter individually activated, expanded, and administered as two separate sequential infusions of equal doses [5]. Preliminary results on the safety and efficacy of liso‐cel in R/R MCL were reported at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting, 2020 [23]. Forty patients underwent leukapheresis and liso‐cel was administered at dose level (DL) of 50 × 106 CAR T cells (n = 6) or 100 × 106 CAR T cells (n = 26) to 32 patients [23]. Median patient age was 67 years (range: 36–80) [23]. High‐risk disease features such as blastoid morphology, high Ki67 index, TP53 mutation and complex karyotype were reported in 37.5%, 72%, 22%, and 34% of patients, respectively [23]. Twenty‐eight (87.5%) had received prior BTKi and 11 (34%) were assessed to be refractory to BTKi [23]. BT was administered to 17 patients (53%) [23]. Twenty‐seven (84%) had grade ≥ 3 AEs, most common being neutropenia followed by anemia and thrombocytopenia [23]. CRS was observed in 16 (50%) with grade ≥3 CRS in only one patient. NAEs were observed in 9 (28%); 3 patients experienced grade ≥3 NAE [23]. OR was observed in 27 patients (84%) with CR in 19 (59%) (Table 1).",
        "It is important to note that in ZUMA‐2 all enrolled patients had prior BTKi therapy; however, the FDA approval is broad and allows any patient with R/R MCL to be eligible for CAR‐T, regardless of prior receipt of BTKi. This is different from the regulatory approval from the EMA, which is restricted to patients who have had prior BTKi. How to best sequence the currently available treatment options in patients with R/R MCL is largely unknown. In spite of outstanding responses with CAR‐T in patients with R/R MCL, long‐term follow‐up is much awaited, and the toxicities and costs associated with CAR‐T are not negligible [24]. The recently published guidelines from American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Center of International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, and European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation recommend CAR‐T in MCL for patients who are intolerant to or relapse after at least one BTKi [25]. Notable exception is only TP53 mutated R/R MCL where an earlier receipt of CAR‐T, prior to BTK exposure may be reasonable [19, 25].",
        "FL is the most common indolent NHL comprising about 35% of all adult NHL [26]. The rituximab era has seen significant improvement in long‐term outcomes for patients with FL with 10‐year OS of ∼80% [27]. Despite excellent long‐term outcomes, FL remains a remarkably heterogenous histology. Various clinical, biological, and genetic prognostic models have been proposed to understand the inherent heterogeneity of FL such as FL international prognostic index (FLIPI), m7‐FLIPI, and progression within 2 years of front line CIT (POD24) [28, 29, 30]. The treatment options in R/R FL are fairly diverse with no single treatment modality shown to be superior and range from CIT, radioimmunotherapy, immunomodulators, and most recently, novel agents such as the PI3K inhibitors and tazemetostat, an EZH2 inhibitor [7, 31–33]. Auto‐HCT and allogeneic (allo) HCT have been both investigated in R/R FL; however, the exact role of each remains largely controversial [34, 35].",
        "Axi‐cel was approved in the United States in 2021 for the treatment of patients with R/R FL after at least two lines of systemic therapy. The approval was based on the primary analysis of ZUMA‐5 trial [36]. One hundred and twenty‐four patients with grade 1 to 3a FL or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (n = 22) who had previously received two lines of therapy received axi‐cel [36]. Axi‐cel was infused at a dose of 2 × 106 cells. Median age was 61 years (range: 34–79) with 57% being male [36]. All patients were heavily pretreated; adverse prognostic features were reported in nearly half of the patients with ECOG >1, stage III/IV disease, ≥3 FLIPI, high tumor bulk and POD24 in 62%, 86%, 47%, 49%, and 55%, respectively [36]. Safety and efficacy data were reported for 84 FL patients with at least 12 months follow‐up. OR was 94% with a CR in 80%. For patients with MZL, OR was 85% with CR in 60%. Most common grade ≥3 AE was neutropenia followed by anemia [36]. Grade ≥3 CRS and NAE were reported in 6% and 15% of patients with FL. A higher incidence of Grade ≥3 NAE was reported in patients MZL at 41% [36]. Outcomes were also reported for nine patients who received retreatment with axi‐cel upon disease relapse [37]. These patients had disease relapse at 3‐month post infusion after initially achieving a OR and maintained CD19 expression at relapse [37]. All patients showed evidence of OR to retreatment, and safety profile was not different from first infusion [37]. Updated outcomes for these patients and two additional patients with FL were recently reported and median DOR remains not reached at 11.4 months [38] (Table 1).",
        "Tisa‐cel has also shown efficacy and safety in R/R FL based on the planned interim analysis of ELARA trial [39]. Patients with grade 1 to 3a FL who had disease relapse within 6 months of second line or later CIT or had disease relapse post auto‐HCT were included. Tisa‐cel was infused at a dose of 0.6–6 × 108 CAR‐T to 97 patients. Median age was 57 years (range: 29–73); 66% were male, 84% had advanced stage disease, and 60% had FLIPI score ≥3. Thirty‐six percent had prior auto‐HCT, 77% had refractory disease to last therapy, and 60% had POD24. Forty‐three percent received BT and 18% received tisa‐cel in the outpatient setting. Fifty‐two patients were assessed for efficacy and had a median follow‐up of 9.9 months. Forty‐three patients (83%) had an OR with 34 (65%) achieving a CR. Responses were seen across all disease prognostic subgroups. Median DOR, PFS, and OS were not reached at last follow‐up. Most common grade ≥3 AE was neutropenia. CRS was reported in 48%; maximum CRS grade was 2. NAEs were reported in 10%; 2% experienced grade ≥3 NAE. No treatment related death was reported (Table 1).",
        "As noted, there are multiple treatment options available today for patients with R/R FL; however, short of an allo‐HCT, none of the treatment options are curative [40]. Despite the increase in treatment options, long‐term outcomes for patients decline sharply after second line of therapy with continued decrease in PFS and OS with each subsequent line [41, 42]. Recently, a comparison of ZUMA‐5 with SCHOLAR‐5 was presented at the European Hematology Association Meeting [43]. SCHOLAR‐5 is a retrospective external control cohort of R/R FL patients who had initiated 3rd or higher line of therapy after July, 2014. Eighty‐six patients from ZUMA‐5 and 85 from SCHOLAR‐5 were included with median follow‐up of 23.3 and 26.2 months, respectively; both cohorts were balanced through propensity scoring. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two cohorts except performance status; ZUMA‐5 had a higher number of patients with poor performance scores [43]. OR, CR, PFS, and OS favored ZUMA‐5 over SCHOLAR‐5. Similar trend was observed when patients who had received four or more lines of therapy were compared [43]. These data support the use of axi‐cel in patients who have received at least two lines of prior systemic therapy, consistent with the current regulatory approval.",
        "CD‐19‐directed auto‐CAR‐T represents a significant milestone in the treatment of patients with R/R NHL. However, disease relapse remains a significant hurdle with long‐term durable responses seen in only about 40–50% of patients [44]. Various mechanisms have been elucidated regarding failure of CAR‐T including antigen loss, host immune dysregulation, and exhausted T‐cell repertoire [1, 45, 46]. Here we discuss targets beyond CD19 and new auto‐CAR‐T platforms that are being investigated in lymphomas with promising early results.",
        "CD30 represents a viable target for CAR‐T in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) as it is uniformly expressed on malignant Hodgkin and Reed‐Sternberg cells and has limited expression on normal tissue. CD30 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily; signal transduction via CD30 activates NF‐kB, enhancing apoptosis of malignant cells [47, 48]. Recently the results of two parallel conducted Phase I/II trials of CAR‐T targeting CD30 in R/R HL were published [49]. Outcomes were reported for 42 adult patients who had progressed after at least two lines of therapy. Median age of treated patients was 35 years (range: 17–69) with 7 median prior lines of therapy (range: 2–23) [49]. Safety profile was excellent with no NAE reported and a maximum of grade 1 CRS in 10 patients (24%) [49]. Thirty‐seven were evaluable for response; OR was achieved in 23 (62%) with CR in 19 (51%). Three different LD regimens were employed, namely bendamustine alone, fludarabine in combination with bendamustine, and fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide. Fludarabine‐based LD chemotherapy regimens were associated with the highest response. At a median follow‐up of 533 days, 1‐year PFS and OS was at 36% and 94%, respectively [49], raising concerns about durable disease control.",

        "CD22 represents another target for CAR‐T in patients with B‐cell malignancies as it is expressed exclusively on malignant B cells [52]. The results of a Phase I dose escalation study of anti‐CD22 CAR‐T in R/R CD22+ B‐cell malignancies were recently reported [53]. Fifty‐eight patients received anti‐CD22 CAR‐T; 51 (87.9%) had prior anti‐CD19 CAR‐T [53]. Among treated patients, one had diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma. CAR‐T cell dose level (DL) ranged from 3 × 105/kg to 3 × 106/kg [53]. Increased toxicity, specifically hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was observed in 19 (32.8%) after CD4/CD8 T‐cell selection was incorporated [53]. A lower dose of 3 × 105/kg was selected for dose expansion thereafter. CRS was overall reported in 50 patients (86.2%) and ranged from grade 1 to 2 in 45 (90%). NAE were reported in 19 (32.8%) with severe NAE in only 1. Forty patients (70.2%) achieved CR [53] (Table 2).",
        "Traditional CARs are directed against a single tumor antigen (e.g., CD19) and their use has been associated with antigen negative (e.g., CD19–) relapses. CARs targeting more than one tumor antigen theoretically may have improved efficacy and/or lower probability of antigen negative disease at release. Investigators at the Medical College of Wisconsin conducted a first‐in‐human trial of bispecific anti‐CD20, anti‐CD19 CAR‐T for adult patients with B‐cell NHL or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [54]. The study used on‐site manufacturing using the CliniMACS Prodigy system. CAR‐T cell dose ranged from 2.5 × 105 to 2.5 × 106 cells/kg. Grade ≥3 CRS occurred in one (5%) patient, and grade ≥3 NAEs occurred in three (14%) patients. Eighteen (82%) patients achieved an OR at day 28, including 14 (64%) CR. Notably, loss of the CD19 antigen was not seen in patients who relapsed [54] (Table 2).",
        "Early results from two Phase I trials with bispecific anti‐CD22, anti‐19 CAR‐T in LBCL have also been encouraging [55, 56]. Patients with CD19+ LBCL who had at least two lines of prior therapy received bispecific anti‐CD19, anti‐CD22 CAR‐T (n = 21); no patient had prior receipt of CD19 CAR‐T. CAR T‐cell DL ranged from 1 × 106/kg to 3 × 106 cells/kg [55]. Grade ≥3 CRS and NAE occurred in one patient each. Best OR at any time was 62% (n = 13) with CR in 29% (n = 6) [55]. Interestingly, 29% (n = 4) patients relapsed with CD19 negative disease but retained expression of CD22 [55]. Sequential infusion of anti‐CD22 and anti‐CD19 CAR‐T is another strategy for dual antigen targeting that has shown encouraging responses. Of note no patient had antigen negative disease relapse in this study (Table 2) [57].",
        "T‐cell lymphomas (TCL) represent a biologically heterogeneous group of lymphomas, typically having an aggressive disease presentation. However, development of CAR‐T in TCL in comparison to their B‐cell counterparts is challenging due to antigen sharing between malignant T cells and CAR‐T; this can lead to a higher risk of antigen masking, fratricide, and T‐cell aplasia [58, 59]. Targeting CD5 as it is a pan T‐cell marker has been evaluated with modest results and other strategies are underway[60]. CD4 is uniformly expressed on most T‐cell lymphomas and represents a target for CAR‐T in TCL. LB1901 is an anti‐CD4 targeting CAR‐T construct that has shown strong antitumor effects in in vivo and in vitro models with no evidence of antigen masking [61]. A Phase I, first‐in‐human trial of LB1901 in adult patients with R/R CD4+ TCL is registered and is about to start recruitment (NCT04712864). T‐cell aplasia can be limited by targeting T‐cell receptor (TCR) β‐chain constant domain 1 and 2 (TRBC1 and TRBC2) as malignant T‐cell express TRBC1 or TRBC2 exclusively unlike their normal counterparts [62]. In preclinical models, anti‐TRBC1 CAR‐T showed antitumor efficacy while sparing normal T cells expressing TRBC2 [62]. A Phase I trial of anti‐TRBC1 CAR‐T in patients with R/R TRBC1 expressing TCL is currently recruiting (NCT04828174) (Table 2).",
        "Despite impressive activity in B‐cell lymphomas and commercial availability, the auto‐CAR‐T construct suffers from several practical limitations (Table 3). First, reliable manufacturing and rapid access are key requirements for the broader application of cellular therapies. Unfortunately, auto‐CAR‐T treatments require a time intensive bespoke manufacturing process. In the pivotal B‐cell lymphoma CAR‐T trials the median turnaround time from apheresis to infusion of CAR product ranged from 15 to 54 days and CAR‐T manufacturing failure was reported in 1–8% of the intended recipients [1, 63–65]. Second, the product T‐cell composition, fitness, and expansion kinetics are important determinants of anti‐CAR responses [67–69]. For example, CAR‐T expansion during manufacturing [69] and enrichment of the final product with central or stem cell memory phenotype have been shown to correlate with efficacy outcomes [68]. These factors in turn are partly dependent of patient factors and prior treatments, leading to significant variability in the infused product characteristics across patients. Third, disease relapse remains a significant clinical problem. Among patients with DLBCL, >50% of patients relapse within a year of receiving CAR‐T [1, 2, 22]. Finally, the cost of commercially available products is high and poses a significant barrier to their widespread [70]. Cost‐effectiveness analyses suggest that compared to chemotherapy, the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CAR‐T therapies for DLBCL is a modest $136,000 per quality‐adjusted life year (QALY) gained [71]. Modifications in the manufacturing technology, for examples, decentralized model of CAR‐T production [72] or use of off‐the‐shelf CAR‐T products may mitigate the costs compared to the current model.",

        "Allo‐CARs (derived from healthy donors or stored cellular products) as a potential “off‐the‐shelf” treatment may circumvent some of limitations associated with auto‐CARs (Table 3). If allo‐CARs live up to their potential of being readily available cellular therapy products, they may obviate the need for bridging treatments and address manufacturing failure occasionally seen with autologous platforms. Whether donor pool, scaling, and manufacturing process would be efficient enough to meet demand remains to be seen. Theoretically allo products can have less variability in terms of T‐cell composition and fitness, but available data to confirm this are not available. These products are also touted as cost friendly options, but this remains unknown at this point.",
        "Before the potential benefits of allo‐CAR‐T therapies are clinically realized, potential pitfalls associated with approach need close attention. The main barrier for universal CAR‐T products is alloreactivity, which results from the donor–recipient human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity imparting a bidirectional risk, that is, to the cellular product (from the recipient immune system) and to the recipient in vivo (from the CAR‐T). This alloreactivity when mediated by the recipient T and NK cells can lead to the rejection of allo‐CARs, thereby limiting the anticancer efficacy. As with conventional unrelated donor allo‐HCT, preexisting antibodies, called donor‐specific anti‐HLA antibodies (DSA), can also mediate immune rejection if the host has been previously sensitized against HLA antigens (e.g., by multiple transfusions, pregnancies) [73] and therefore, screening for DSA in the recipient may be a necessary step before allo‐CAR administration. Several strategies are under investigation to minimize the risk of allo‐CAR rejection. Suppression of HLA class I expression by disrupting the HLA‐A or β2‐microglobulin (B2M; nonpolymorphic subunit of HLA‐I complex) genes in allo‐CAR‐T via gene editing would allow T cells to evade elimination by the host immune system [75–79]. Knocking out B2M reduces surface expression of HLA class I; however, these HLA‐I negative universal T cells could still be rejected by recipient NK cells [79]. Employing an anti‐NK‐cell depleting antibody or engineering T cells with HLA‐E expression are possible solutions to evade NK‐mediated rejection [80, 81].",
        "In the other direction, the allo‐CAR‐T reactivity directed against the host can lead to the development of lethal graft‐versus‐host disease (GVHD) [82]. One strategy to reduce the risk of GVHD is the use of allo‐virus‐specific T cells (VST) CARs. The administration of such allo‐T cells with a narrow TCR repertoire may have a lower risk of initiating GVHD [83, 84, 85, 86]. Another approach is to disrupt the native TCR through deletion of TCR α constant (TCRAC) or TCRBC genes in the allo‐T cells, using gene‐editing technologies [74, 75, 76]. CAR‐T lacking surface TCR expression are incapable of mounting an alloreactive response against the recipient. However, depending on the gene editing method used, some unedited, TCR‐bearing T cells may remain and can potentially cause GVHD.",
        "Expansion and persistence of CAR cells are vital to achieve short‐term control and may be important for long‐term efficacy in certain diseases [87]. The risk of alloimmunization is also a concern, where new CAR‐specific antibody generation in the recipient may limit redosing of the allo‐CAR‐T [88]. Disrupting HLA expression alone may not be sufficient for CAR‐T long‐term persistence and efficacy. Further manipulations of the T cells may be needed, for example, knocking out T‐cell inhibitory receptors such as PD‐1, TIM‐3, LAG‐3, and CTLA‐4 can enable CAR‐T to avoid exhaustion, improve persistence, and evade immunologic response [79, 89, 90]. Allo‐CAR‐NK are limited by their short lifespan of a few weeks without cytokine support; however, recent advances such as incorporation of cytokine transgenes (e.g., interleukin [IL]‐2 or IL‐15) can enhance NK‐cell proliferation and survival [91].",
        "With genomic editing technologies, oncogenesis via oncogene activation or disruption of tumor suppressor genes is potential concerns [92]. It is critical to avoid insertional oncogenesis by using approaches such as optimized sgRNA design and Cas9 activity, prior off‐target detection assays, and careful selection of target loci [93, 94]. Bishop et al. generated anti‐CD19 CAR‐T from HLA‐identical sibling donors of allo‐transplant recipients with relapsed B‐cell acute leukemia or high‐grade NHL, using the high‐capacity piggyBac transposon, instead of a viral vector [95]. Two patients in the cohort of 10 developed CD19+ T‐cell malignancies, raising questions about the oncogenic potential of the piggyBac system.",
        "Several allo‐cellular therapy platforms are being actively investigated in lymphoid malignancies (Table 4). Most allo‐T‐cell therapies have used αβ T cells with knocked out TCR to eliminate alloreactivity. Other platforms have restricted or invariant TCRs, like γδ T cells, VSTs, or natural killer (NK) cells.",

        "Abbreviations: CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; CR, complete remission; CRS, cytokine release syndrome; DLBCL, diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma; FL, follicular lymphoma; GVHD, Graft‐versus‐Host Disease; NHL, non‐Hodgkin lymphoma; NK, natural killer; ICANS, immune effector cell‐associated neurotoxicity syndrome; ORR, overall response rate.",
        "NK cells play a pivotal role in immune surveillance by targeting cancer or virally infected cells that down regulate HLA class I molecules [96]. Allo‐NK cells have been used for adoptive immunotherapy for cancer patients with excellent safety profile [97], and now NK‐cell‐derived CARs are being investigated in B‐cell lymphomas and other malignancies. The group at MD Anderson Cancer Center pioneered the use of CD19‐directed NK‐CARs derived from umbilical cord blood (UCB) units [98]. The study used a retroviral vector carrying genes that encoded CD19‐directed CAR, IL‐15 to enhance the in vivo expansion and persistence of the transduced NK cells (“Armored CAR”), and an inducible caspase 9 to trigger apoptosis of the CAR‐NK (as a safety switch). The results showed a promising safety and efficacy profile in 11 NHL and CLL patients with clinical responses observed in 73% of patients [98] (Table 4).",
        "Other NK‐cell source beyond UCB includes induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and NK‐cell lines. FT516 is a CD19‐specific NK‐CAR in development against relapsed, refractory B‐cell NHL, and is engineered from a clonal master iPSC line, with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)‐mediated insertion of the CAR at the TRAC locus (Table 4). The key attributes include a proprietary CAR optimized for NK‐cell biology that targets the antigen of interest, a novel high‐affinity 158V, noncleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor, which has been modified to prevent its downregulation and to enhance its binding to tumor‐targeting antibodies, and an IL‐15 receptor fusion (IL‐15RF) that promotes enhanced NK‐cell activity [99]. CAR‐NK might represent a promising therapeutic option with all the benefits inherent to “off‐the‐shelf” therapies pending the clinical trial results.",
        "Several allo‐CAR‐T clinical trials are employing conventional αβ T cells from healthy donors (Table 4). The following gene‐editing technologies have been used in generating allo‐CAR‐T.",
        "Transcription activator‐like effector nucleases (TALEN) technology is arguably the first gene editing technology used in the generation of universal allo‐CAR‐T for lymphoma patients in clinical trials. TALENs are transcription factors (hybrid molecules) linked to an endonuclease that can be engineered to cut specific DNA sequences [100]. Knocking out the TRAC gene locus is an attractive approach to disrupt the expression αβ TCR, thereby limiting the GVHD initiating potential of allo‐CAR‐T. By simultaneously electroporating TALENs that disrupted TCR and CD52 expression in the T cells, in the preclinical model, this methodology produced allo‐CAR‐T that did not induce GVHD and were resistant to anti‐CD52 monoclonal antibody used to eliminate host T cells [77]. The latter was employed as an immunosuppressive strategy to prevent recipient immune cell‐mediated rejection of CAR‐T. As shown in Table 4, Allogene 501 trial using this platform produced CR rates of 50% in patients DLBCL and FL with to date no reports of GVHD or frequent CRS or ICANS. These preliminary finds need confirmation with longer follow‐up and a larger sample size [101, 102].",
        "Meganucleases are a group of naturally occurring and highly specific restriction enzymes with gene‐editing potential. Precision BioSciences has developed a next‐generation meganuclease platform called “ARCUS” that can produce nucleases with customized activity and specificity [103, 104]. PBCAR0191 is an anti‐CD19 allo‐CAR‐T that disrupts TCR expression via CAR gene insertion in the TRAC locus [105] (Table 4), and is being tested in a Phase I/II study. At last follow‐up, 16 patients with aggressive NHL were treated [106]. The trial employed either standard or escalated doses (higher fludarabine and cyclophosphamide doses) of LD regimens. Overall, the study demonstrated a CR rate of 38%, but among four patients getting escalated LD, three achieved a CR. No episodes of grade ≥ 3 CRS or NAE were noted, but severe infections were more frequently seen with escalated LD.",
        "CRISPR system is a simple, versatile, and precise gene‐editing tool with highly efficiency multiplex genomic‐editing capability [74, 79, 107–109]. Multiplex genome‐editing allows sequence‐specific gene delivery, resulting in a highly efficient 2‐in‐1 TCR knockout and CAR knock in for universal allo‐CAR‐T, with the advantages of significantly lower risks of insertional oncogenesis and TCR‐induced alloreactivity [103, 110]. Replacing the endogenous TCR with a CAR not only disrupts the TCR but also brings CAR under the regulatory control of the endogenous TCR promoter, leading to improved T‐cell function and potency [110]. Multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to generate allo‐universal CAR‐T deficient in TCR β chain, B2M, PD‐1, and CTLA‐4, which have been shown to maintain function in vitro and in vivo [74, 109, 111]. The  CRISPR Therapeutics’ CRISPR‐edited anti‐CD19 CAR‐T cell trial (CTX110) is ongoing and enrolling patients with B‐cell NHL (Table 4) [112].",
        "Epstein–Barr VSTs (EBVSTs) are virus‐specific and hence have limited TCR repertoire and therefore are less likely to mediate GVHD [113]. To prevent rejection, CD30 CAR can be introduced into “off‐the‐shelf” EBVSTs. CD30 CAR allows targeting CD30+ lymphomas and has proved safe and effective in clinical trials of auto‐CAR‐T [49]. A Phase I trial evaluating allo‐CD30 CAR EBVSTs (TT11X) therapy in patients with heavily pretreated CD30+ HL and NHL is ongoing (Table 4) [113].",
        "Conventionally αβ T cells have been used for production of CAR‐T, however, γδ T cells may offer unique advantages over αβ T cells [114]. Despite the small number of γδ T cells present in peripheral blood, these cells can be expanded ex vivo to produce clinically significant yield for therapeutic effect [115]. Preclinical data have demonstrated γδ T‐cell expressing anti‐CD19 CAR have potent cytotoxicity toward CD19+ leukemia cell lines in vitro and in vivo [116]. γδ T cells can also recognize pathogen (including viral) stressed and transformed target cells in an HLA‐independent fashion and are activated in an allo‐setting without the concern of GVHD. γδ1 CAR T‐cell product targeting CD20 is now entering clinical trials for treatment of B‐cell malignancies (NCT04735471). The study is using selectively expanded γδ1 T cells from healthy donors that are engineered with a second‐generation CAR construct (4‐1BBz).",
        "CAR‐T therapy is a revolutionary treatment for patients with R/R B‐cell lymphomas. Although the platform currently has multiple limitations as discussed, the future for CAR‐T appears promising with multiple strategies underway to increase efficacy and limit toxicity. The approval of CAR‐T in MCL and FL represents a significant advancement in the field, as these histologies have traditionally been considered incurable unlike LBCL. Whether CAR‐T can lead to a cure in these lymphomas remains to be proven, pending long‐term follow‐up data. Combining novel targeted agents with CAR‐T is another promising strategy. In preclinical MCL models, concurrent treatment with ibrutinib and CAR‐T resulted in improved responses and decreased toxicity [117]. This combination is rational as ibrutinib blocks inducible T‐cell kinase in addition to BTK and with resultant enhanced Th1‐type cellular immunity [118]; ongoing TRANSCEND‐004 clinical trial is evaluating this combination in patients with CLL (NCT03331198).",
        "Expansion of CAR‐T to additional lymphoma histologies such as HL and TCL is expected, pending the results of ongoing trials; primary and secondary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL/SCNSL) represent orphan diseases with particularly poor outcomes for patients with R/R disease. ZUMA‐1 and JULIET excluded patients with CNSL; however, patients with SCNSL were allowed in TRANSCEND‐NHL‐001(5). Safety and efficacy were not significantly different from patients without CNS involvement; additional experience from the real‐world setting is also consistent with that of TRANSCEND‐NHL‐001(5) [119]. The three currently approved CD‐19‐directed CAR‐T in LBCL (i.e., axi‐cel, tisa‐cel, and liso‐cel) are being actively investigated in patients with PCNSL and SCNSL (NCT04608487) (NCT04134117) (NCT03484702); results are currently awaited. A recently published report from an ongoing Phase I trial (NCT02153580) has shown encouraging responses with manageable toxicities in a small subset of patients (n = 5) with PCNSL receiving CD19‐directed CAR‐T [120].",
        "Current experience with CAR‐T therapy has clearly established that CAR‐T in lymphoma is here to stay. However, with the various platforms of CAR‐T therapy that are currently in development, there are multiple questions that emerge. Most importantly, whether a particular CAR design or cell type will be superior in terms of efficacy and safety. Allo‐CARs can potentially be the answer to the limitations currently experienced with auto‐CARs; however, the platform is associated with notable risks such as that of bidirectional alloreactivity and insertional oncogenesis among others. Second, how can these various therapeutic cell products be sequenced to allow for best long‐term outcomes in patients with lymphoma. Lastly, if the safety profile of a particular product would allow for widespread CAR‐T expansion in the community, particularly outpatient (OP) administration, 10% and 18% of patients received CAR‐T as an OP in TRANSCEND‐NHL‐001 and the ELARA trial, respectively. TRANSCEND‐OUTREACH‐007 (NCT03744676) is currently ongoing and is exploring the safety and efficacy of liso‐cel in the outpatient setting.",

        "With growing indications for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, toxicity profiles are evolving. There is an urgent and unmet need of approaches to optimally manage emerging adverse events that extend beyond the standard paradigm of cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Although management guidelines exist for ICANS, there is little guidance on how to approach patients with neurologic comorbidities, and how to manage rare neurotoxicity presentations, such as CAR T-cell therapy–related cerebral edema, severe motor complications or late-onset neurotoxicity.

        "With 6 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and many more showing promise in clinical trials, the need for hematologists to be aware of challenging complications and know how to manage them in routine practice is paramount. Introduced by Associate Editor Helen E. Heslop, this How I Treat series highlights several key complications, reviews current understanding of their etiologies, and provides guidance on therapies through discussion of illustrative cases.",
        "Neurologic events are a common complication of the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. By expert consensus, a readily recognizable constellation of neurologic clinical features called immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) has been defined.1 ICANS consists of an acute, typically monophasic constellation of mental status changes, particularly language disturbance that may progress to more severe manifestations, such as seizures, coma, and cerebral edema.1 Reported risk factors include patient-related factors, such as young age, high tumor burden, and a history of early-onset and/or high-grade cytokine release syndrome (CRS).2,3 The type of costimulatory domain (CD28 vs 4-1BB) in the CAR construct and lymphodepletion regimens have been implicated.4,5 Pretreatment inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen are associated with high ICANS risk.6,7 After the infusion, ICANS is associated with higher peak C-reactive protein; ferritin; proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma, IL-6, IL-1, IL-10, MCP-1; markers of endothelial activation;7,8 and CAR expansion, compared with the levels before infusion.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Currently available consensus guidelines and institution-specific interventions14, 15, 16, 17, 18 do not include strategies for managing rarer neurologic complications observed with the commercial products. As new CAR constructs enter clinical trials for different diseases, the neurotoxicity profile of CAR T-cell therapy may continue to evolve.19, 20, 21 In this study, we use 3 unique clinical scenarios of CAR T-cell therapy–related neurotoxicity to illustrate how to approach workup and management.",
        "A 6-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) presents for the consideration of tisagenlecleucel therapy after her third relapse. She has a history of seizures in the setting of sepsis. Her most recent relapse was isolated to the central nervous system (CNS), and she received bridging therapy (including intrathecal methotrexate) to reduce the CNS disease burden. Three weeks before the presentation, she developed a rapid-onset weakness in the left arm and face. Her magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an area of diffusion restriction in the right hemispheric white matter, consistent with methotrexate neurotoxicity. The weakness resolved, but the referring team would have liked further guidance on how to optimize the safety of CAR T-cell therapy.",
        "Neurologic comorbidities in ALL are common. They include CNS disease, chemotherapy, and radiation complications, such as methotrexate toxicity, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, cognitive impairment, and headache.8,22 Although there is mixed evidence on whether neurologic comorbidities increase the overall risk of ICANS,22,23 CAR T-cell treatment often triggers the worsening of chronic conditions. In the context of our patient’s history, we were concerned about breakthrough seizures, so we increased her maintenance dose of levetiracetam. We chose antiseizure medications, such as levetiracetam or lacosamide that could be easily converted to be administered IV. Another concern for our patient was the focal lesion from methotrexate toxicity because the areas of chronic brain injuries (eg, from prior hemorrhage) have been associated with focal inflammation during ICANS.8,22,23",
        "Multiple tools have been developed to stratify the risk of ICANS using clinical markers.6,7,13 None have sufficient sensitivity and specificity at the prelymphodepletion time to guide our decision-making. There is good evidence that CNS leukemia or lymphoma can be successfully targeted by CAR T cells,24, 25, 26 with no increased incidence of ICANS.27 Thus, we recommend that neurologic comorbidities and/or active CNS disease should not preclude eligibility for CAR T-cell therapy. Bridging therapy can be used to decrease the CNS disease burden. Patients with serious preexisting neurologic comorbidities should receive a neurology consultation during their pre-CAR T-cell therapy evaluation to optimize preventive medications and record a baseline neurologic exam (Table 1). We recommend baseline surveillance studies, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and brain MRI, and inpatient admission for observation.Table 1.Therapeutic approaches for CAR T-cell therapy–related neurotoxicityTherapyTimingCommentsIV corticosteroidsTherapeutic14, 15, 16Among patients who received corticosteroids at the onset of grade 3 (ZUMA-1 C 1+2) and earlier for grade 1 NEs (C4), rates of grade ≥3 NEs were 28% and 17%, respectively.IV corticosteroidsProphylactic28,29The incidence of grade ≥3 NEs in ZUMA-1 C6 (13%) was comparable to that of C4 (17%), and both rates were comparably lower than C1+2 (28%). In ZUMA-1 C6, patients received once-daily oral dexamethasone at 10 mg plus C4 management on d 0 (before axi-cel), 1, and 2. The updated follow-up included a few additional NEs and the total incidence of grade ≥3 NEs was 15%.AnakinraTherapeutic30, 31, 32Four of 6 patients who received anakinra for the management of high-grade ICANS experienced clinical benefit.32 In 9 out of additional 14 patients with ICANS, the reduction of peak ICANS could be reached within 1 day after the last anakinra dose.30 Twenty three patients treated with anakinra for steroid-refractory ICANS. CRS/ICANS improvement was observed among 73% of patients; higher response rates in patients receiving higher doses (8 mg/kg per d).33AnakinraProphylactic34#NCT04148430: 31 patients received anakinra starting on d 2 or after 2 documented fevers of ≥38.5°C before day 2, whichever time point was earlier. The overall severe ICANS rate was 6%. Other ongoing clinical trials include #NCT04432506, #NCT04359784, #NCT04150913, and #NCT04205838.TocilizumabTherapeuticApproved for use in CRS but is not effective for isolated neurotoxicity and may be associated with worsening neurotoxicity.27TocilizumabProphylactic35Not recommended.

        "In the neurology consultation, the doctor recommended a repeat MRI before CAR T-cell infusion, the results of which showed resolution of diffusion restriction with residual increased white matter fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), indicative of chronic injury. The neurologic exam showed normal results. On day 4, she developed grade 3 CRS that was successfully treated with tocilizumab and dexamethasone. However, on day 6, she developed confusion, and in the evening, she had a 1-minute seizure that started with shaking of the left arm and evolved into a generalized convulsive seizure. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation because of a persistently low level of consciousness. Report of head computed tomography (CT) was normal, the opening pressure on lumbar puncture was 25 mm Hg, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein was 245 mg/dL, white blood cell count was 33 × 103/μL, and the result of rapid viral polymerase chain reaction was negative. Continuous EEG showed a diffusely slow background but no more seizures. MRI showed T2 hyperintensity and diffusion restriction in the bilateral thalami and leptomeningeal FLAIR hyperintensity. She was treated with methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg and started on anakinra (2 mg/kg every 6 hours). The next morning (day 7), the patient remained comatose without sedation, and the head CT showed possible early cerebral edema. We continued high-dose methylprednisolone and anakinra and added hypertonic saline and a pentobarbital infusion to decrease cerebral energy demand. Head CT on day 9 showed improvement of the cerebral edema, pentobarbital was weaned, and steroids were converted to dexamethasone at a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 3 more days. On day 11, the patient was extubated and within a few days returned to normal neurologic function. She achieved a complete, durable ALL remission.",
        "For patients with severe and/or refractory ICANS, we start high-dose steroids and anakinra with or without siltuximab. We avoid tocilizumab for the treatment of isolated ICANS because it does not appear to reverse neurologic symptoms, and there is concern that it could worsen neurotoxicity.17,38,39 Although high-quality evidence is not yet available, anakinra has become a mainstay therapy for refractory ICANS based on preclinical data and clinical safety experience.30, 31, 32,40 Institution-dependent approaches may favor the use of anakinra for severe ICANS, especially in the pediatric patient population or life-threatening/refractory grade 3 ICANS in the adult setting. For patients with rapidly declining neurologic status and/or signs of increased intracranial pressure, we initiate the treatment of cerebral edema. Imaging findings often lag behind clinical progression in these cases. We model neuroprotective and intracranial pressure-lowering interventions based on standard neurocritical care practice, including normotension, normothermia, normocarbia, aggressive seizure control, raising the head of the bed, hypertonic saline, and, in selected cases, pentobarbital coma. There is no clear role for neurosurgical intervention in the setting of maximal medical therapy. If the patient stabilizes within the first 12 or 24 hours without progressing to herniation, the typical course is monophasic with continued improvement. Continuous EEG monitoring can be very helpful to rule out seizures as EEG background abnormalities closely correlate with ICANS severity.41",
        "In cases of severe ICANS without overt cerebral edema, we have observed that CSF removal is often accompanied by symptomatic improvement. We perform lumbar punctures if it is safe and transfuse platelets if needed. We include opening pressure measurements as well as differential cell counts, protein level measurements, and laboratory tests to rule out infection. Intrathecal immunomodulating therapies, such as corticosteroids and chemotherapy, have been advocated by some groups.36,37 We do not typically use this approach for ICANS because there is little evidence for T-cell proinflammatory cytokine production within the CNS, and CSF cytokine levels largely mirror levels in the blood.42 In addition, a more permeable blood-brain barrier (BBB) during ICANS should allow good drug access from the circulation.43 If there is a concern for cerebral edema or raised intracranial pressure, intrathecal therapy is probably not safe or effective. CSF circulation would be expected to be poor under these conditions, leading to the suboptimal targeting of the neurovascular unit in the brain. Finally, outcomes from 1 case series raise the concern that intrathecal treatments may be associated with grade 5 infection among patients who are also treated with systemic corticosteroids and anakinra.37",
        "A 40-year-old woman with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was referred for the consideration of axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel). After having progression in bone and lymph nodes with chemotherapy, she was treated with radiotherapy (RT) for symptomatic thoracic epidural disease at T7 6 months before axi-cel, followed by the anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD1) inhibitor nivolumab for progressive osseous disease. She developed new sacral numbness and pain and was found to have a new disease in her sacrococcygeal bones upon being treated with bridging radiation 1 month before the referral for axi-cel. She was examined by the neurologist for pretreatment, and the results of the neurologic exam were normal, except for a mild sensory loss in the sacrum. A repeat spine MRI was recommended, given her history of the symptomatic epidural disease. The scan showed resolved thoracic epidural disease and very good partial response in the sacrum RT field. The MRI brain report was normal. Will radiation increase her chance of developing ICANS?",
        "Despite the evidence that CD19-CAR T cells are well tolerated with objective responses with no increased neurotoxicity,25,26 in our experience, poor outcomes are common among patients with advanced CNS lymphoma. Therefore, we attempt to limit CNS disease burden before CAR T-cell therapy to increase the chance of disease clearance and reduce toxicity. We pay special attention to lesions that might impair CSF flow as immune-related pseudoprogressions resulting in the transient enlargement of the lesion that could occur from CAR-associated inflammation. This emerging phenomenon has been termed as tumor inflammation–associated neurotoxicity (TIAN).20,44 TIAN is likely mechanistically different from ICANS in that it is directly attributable to focal inflammation at the tumor site, as opposed to the more global brain dysfunctions observed in ICANS.",
        "Bridging therapy may include radiation to the CNS or adjacent structures. Anecdotal evidence suggests that focal injury from radiation or other treatment-related insults may make those areas more vulnerable to ICANS-related inflammation. In a pediatric study, a patient with preexisting radiation injury to the cerebellum developed cerebellar edema upon CD19-CAR T-cell treatment, leading to acute obstructive hydrocephalus requiring temporary CSF diversion.22 In another case report, the CAR T-cell targeting of leukemic infiltrates in the optic nerve and retina of a child led to retinal detachment, likely because of focal inflammation akin to pseudoprogression.45 In larger studies, there did not appear to be any association of bridging therapy use, including RT, with severe CRS or ICANS.46,47 In general, we feel that even a high CNS tumor burden should not preclude eligibility for CAR T-cell therapy. For patients with a history of prior or current CNS involvement, we recommend reimaging areas of the neuroaxis that were sites of disease. A baseline neurologic exam in these situations is important (Table 2). Baseline CSF sampling should be performed if there is proven or suspected active leptomeningeal disease. For patients with high CNS disease burden at the time of CAR infusion, more frequent neurologic checks after the infusion may be warranted for monitoring for TIAN in addition to ICANS.Table 2.Neurologic testing in the management of CAR T-cell therapy toxicitiesBefore CAR T-cell therapyFrom 1 to 30 d after CAR T-cell therapy1 mo after CAR–T-cell therapyNeurological assessmentYES, baseline mental status, neuro history (Nervous system toxicity from prior therapy, seizure, stroke, migraine, CNS disease, radiation, trauma, andneuropathy).YES, monitor ICANS, additional attention to handwriting, movement, and personality changes for BCMA-CAR T-cell therapy.High-prolonged CRS increases the risk of ICANS.YES, full assessment at 1-3-6 months may be indicated in the case of delayed or prolonged neurotoxicity or in the case of BCMA products to screen for early signs of movement and MNTs.EEGGenerally, not helpful unless a history of epilepsy.YES, during ICANS to r/o nonconvulsive seizures and to monitor critically ill patients.YES, consider if any recurrent altered mental status.NeuroimagingYES, if history of CNS disease in cases of preexisting neurologic injury.YES, if ICANS occurs.YES, for any delayed neurologic symptoms.CAR T measurements (blood and CSF)N/AUnclear utility in the short-term management.May be helpful if available.

        "The patient received axi-cel and, on day +2, developed grade 2 CRS responsive to tocilizumab. On day +5, she developed altered mental status with an immune effector cell encephalopathy (ICE) score of 0. Although she was awake, she was not speaking coherently and followed no commands. She was prescribed dexamethasone at a dose of 10 mg every 6 hours for grade 3 ICANS. Over the next 4 hours, she became rapidly unresponsive to verbal and tactile stimuli (grade 4 ICANS). The neurologic exam revealed that she had focal alterations with right-side neglect, tonic posturing, and left-side stereotyped movements concerning seizures clinically. Head CT report was normal. EEG showed intermittent rhythmic delta activity on the right, with periods of relative attenuation on the left. Because of the clinical concern for nonconvulsive seizures, the levetiracetam dose was increased, and lorazepam and fosphenytoin were added. Her medication profile was reviewed; she was not receiving any seizure-inducing antibiotics. The dexamethasone dose was escalated to 20 mg every 6 hours. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed that showed that the white blood cell count was 13 × 103/μL, protein level was elevated, and viral polymerase chain reaction reports were negative. The opening pressure was slightly elevated (21 cm H20). Hyponatremia was corrected. She received high-dose thiamine (500 mg) every 8 hours for 72 hours, followed by daily maintenance supplementation. Her mental status rapidly improved 24 hours after the LP, so her treatment was not escalated to pulse methylprednisolone. Brain MRI results showed no complex findings.",
        "As we had done in this scenario, we review the medications of any patient who develops myoclonus or seizure, because certain antibiotics such as imipenem and cefepime carry a risk of excitotoxicity and seizures.48,49 Studies have demonstrated that BBB permeability increases during ICANS,8,12 and this may allow higher concentrations of these excitotoxic antibiotics to reach the CNS, further increasing seizure risk.",
        "We typically administer thiamine repletion in the setting of severe CRS or ICANS. During severe ICANS, MRI changes resembling those in Wernicke encephalopathy, with T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the dorsomedial thalami and tectal plate, have been reported12 (Figure 1). We have found abnormally low thiamine levels in hospitalized patients requiring CAR T-cell therapy. Inflammation is thought to be a factor driving thiamine-deficient state, and patients with sepsis are frequently thiamine deficient.50 Thiamine deficiency decreases BBB competence.51 We supplement patients experiencing severe CRS or ICANS with high-dose thiamine for 3 days, followed by daily thiamine until CRS and ICANS resolve.Figure 1.Examples of MRI changes during severe ICANS.

        "In our experience, hyponatremia can develop before the onset of ICANS, and this should be monitored closely and corrected.52 Cerebral edema and seizures can worsen with or be precipitated by hyponatremia. Although the CSF opening pressure was not elevated, the patient had marked improvement in her mental status the day after the LP was performed. Our opinion is that CSF drainage, even in the setting of near-normal opening pressure, may be helpful in managing ICANS. For patients who have had minimal improvement of ICANS symptoms after starting corticosteroids, we strongly consider performing an LP if safety conditions are met. We acknowledge that there are no published data supporting this approach.",
        "On day +6, fever and mental status improved. She was oriented to person and more interactive than on previous days. On day +7, she had new paraplegia. She had an L1 sensory level, bilateral, positive Babinski signs, and new urinary retention. Spine MRI performed on day 7 showed diffuse edema of the spinal cord (all levels) with unchanged osseous lesions. She continued high-dose steroids, and high-dose IV immune globulin (IVIG; 0.4G/kg per day ×5 days) was added. Her mental status completely recovered by day 9. She had a repeat spine MRI on day 34 that showed resolved spine edema. Paraplegia gradually improved over 2 months, leading to a gradual tapering of her steroid dose. By 3 weeks, she had improved sphincter control, and by 2 months, she was able to walk with a walker, and the steroids were discontinued. She continues to be in remission of DLBCL after more than 4 years, with ongoing B-cell aplasia. She walks without assistive devices.",
        "A few cases of myelitis after CAR have been reported. Nair et al described 2 patients who developed acute leucoencephalomyelopathy with quadriparesis after treatment with axi-cel.50 One patient with DLBCL developed cerebral edema in addition to spine edema. The patient was treated with corticosteroids for 3 weeks, which resulted in rapid mental status improvement by 2 weeks, radiographic improvement of the brain in 27 days and spine in 6 months, and the ability to ambulate by 6 months. The second patient in this series had primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and developed grade 3 ICANS in addition to quadriparesis, which improved over several weeks after treatment with steroids.53 Another patient developed transverse myelitis with sensory changes, weakness, and urinary retention developing 27 days after receiving axi-cel and had some improvement in symptoms with steroids, IVIG, and plasma exchange.54 Similar to our patient, the patient in this case report had received anti-PD1 as bridging therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can be associated with neurologic adverse events, including longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis,55 although checkpoint blockade has been combined with CAR T-cell therapy with a manageable safety profile.56 Another patient with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma developed myelitis associated with paraplegia on day 6 after CAR T-cell therapy and was treated with siltuximab based on the finding of elevated IL-6 in the CSF. The altered mental status resolved, but the paraplegia did not improve.57 Another case of myelitis was associated with a fatal human herpesvirus 6 infection.58",
        "There is justified concern that high-dose steroids may impair the efficacy of CAR T cells. High doses of steroids initiated early and for prolonged courses were associated with significantly shorter progression-free and overall survival in 1 series of 100 patients who received standard-of-care anti-CD19–CAR T-cell therapy.59 Our patient, despite high-dose steroids initiated early (before day 7) and continued for 2 months, had a complete and durable response. In a pilot retrospective study, IVIG appeared safe to use during CAR T-cell therapy but did not significantly reduce severe ICANS compared with steroids alone.60 IVIG was added to corticosteroids in this case, extrapolating from the treatment for idiopathic inflammatory transverse myelitis, and the patient had near full motor recovery.",
        "A 71-year-old man presented with immunoglobulin Gκ multiple myeloma that had progressed after multiple prior lines of therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. He was treated with idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma). Within 24 hours of the CAR T-cell infusion, he developed grade 2 CRS that eventually resolved. On day 5, he developed handwriting impairment and subsequently became confused and disoriented (ICE score 6). The neurotoxicity symptoms resolved with standard interventions.",
        "Six months after B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)–CAR T-cell infusion, he developed seizures, confusion, diminished attention, disorientation, agitation, aphasia, and tremors (grade 3 ICANS) and received steroids. The disease assessment showed a very good partial response. He progressed with obtundation and papilledema and developed cerebral edema. The patient was treated with high-dose steroids and anakinra and supportive care with no success and eventually died of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure.",
        "This case highlights potential delayed toxicity from CAR T-cell therapy. The median time to the onset of neurotoxicity is 5 or 6 days (range, 1-17 days) after the CAR T-cell infusion and may depend on the CAR product and the disease type. Neurotoxicity usually resolves within 4 weeks in CD19 CAR T-cell therapy.17,61 Cohen et al reported that the median time to onset of ICANS with ciltacabtagene autoleucel in patients with myeloma was 8 days (range, 3-12 days), and the median duration was 4 days (range, 1-12 days). However, other CAR T-cell neurotoxicities may develop later after ciltacabtagene autoleucel infusion.62 One extraordinary case report of delayed neurotoxicity describes a 76-year-old woman with DLBCL, who fully recovered after a prolonged course for typical ICANS, then 6 months after CAR T-cell infusion, experienced a recurrence of severe ICANS symptoms. Her condition did not improve after 11 days of treatment with dexamethasone, but she recovered completely after a dose of cyclophosphamide. Her disease response improved from a partial to a complete response during this time, suggesting delayed activation and expansion of her CAR T cells.63 More subtle changes in neurocognitive performance and cognitive domains (ie, attention, executive function, verbal ability, immediate and delayed memory, and visuospatial abilities) have been reported in CAR T-cell therapy recipients up to 1 year after CAR T-cell infusion.64",
        "Symptoms occurring concurrently with CRS tend to be of shorter duration and lower grade (grade 1-2) than neurotoxicity occurring after CRS, which is more commonly grade ≥3 and protracted. Neurologic monitoring, including ICE score and neurologic exam, is recommended for all patients during the first 30 days after CAR infusion but is continued for longer if toxicity is delayed or prolonged. Although the approved BCMA-CAR products are generally associated with lower ICANS rates than CD19 CAR, neurologic monitoring for 3 months or more may be indicated for patients treated with BCMA-CAR even if ICANS has completely resolved. The purpose of this extended monitoring is to screen for early signs of movement and neurocognitive treatment–emergent adverse events (MNTs), rare events that have a later onset than ICANS. In the CARTITUDE-1 trial, the 5 patients who developed MNTs had a median onset of 27 days after infusion (range, 14-108 days) compared with 8 days (range, 3-12 days) for ICANS. These MNTs are characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, bradyphrenia, flat affect, personality change, apathy, gait disorder, and cognitive impairment. Patients may have normal ICE scores, but handwriting change, specifically micrographia, appears to be an early finding. Risk factors for MNTs include high tumor burden, grade ≥2 CRS after infusion, ICANS after infusion, and high CAR T-cell expansion and persistence. All 5 patients reported were male. This would suggest that a general approach for neurologic monitoring after BCMA-CAR therapy should be a scheduled neurologic assessment at 1-3-6 months after CAR T-cell infusion, with a focus on handwriting, muscle tone, facial expression, and gait. Patients should also be counseled regarding the need to inform their care team if there are any unexpected changes. For instance, unexpected cerebellar toxicities were recently reported in a trial of GPRC5D-specific CAR T cells for patients with multiple myeloma treated with a high dose of CAR T cells.19",
        "The trigger of delayed neurologic events is unknown. In the case of MNTs, distinct pathophysiology involving on-target off-tumor targeting of BCMA in the basal ganglia is hypothesized. More generally, for all CAR products, infections occurring after CAR T-cell infusion may theoretically overactivate and reexpand CAR T cells in vulnerable patients.",
        "Unusual neurologic complications should be anticipated with novel patterns of immune activation as well as new CAR constructs, because on-target off-tumor activity in the CNS is a persistent concern. Possible targeting of BCMA-expressing cells to the basal ganglia was previously reported, although there were additional risk factors including high tumor burden, previous grade ≥2 CRS, previous ICANS, and high CAR –T- cell expansion and persistence.21",
        "Although canonical ICANS is well-defined based on diagnostic criteria, patients may present with additional signs and symptoms that require specific management strategies. The first 2 cases address rare edema of the brain or spine occurring after CAR T-cell therapy. Cerebral edema is a rare but potentially fatal neurologic complication of CAR T-cell therapy. In the ROCKET clinical trial evaluating from 19 to 28z CAR T cells in adult patients with B-cell ALL, 5 patients developed fatal cerebral edema leading to the termination of the trial.65 A root cause investigation found that patients who developed cerebral edema were younger than 30 years, had a higher percentage of CD8+ cells in the CAR product, had higher serum levels of IL-15 after the infusion, and had a rapid expansion of CAR T cells peaking within the first week, which was associated with a sharp increase in the blood levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and IL-2, compared with those who did not develop cerebral edema. Autopsies of 2 patients revealed a complete breakdown of the BBB but an absence of activated T cells in the CNS. These results suggest that the BBB breakdown and subsequent cerebral edema were probably the result of a surge of serum cytokines rather than the infiltration of CAR T cells into the CNS. The patient who developed leukoencephalomyelopathy in a case report from the ZUMA-1 trial was also found to have a massive expansion of peripheral CAR T cells and prominent features of BBB disruption.53 Our patient had myelopathy and spine edema without cerebral edema but had similar features of early-onset neurotoxicity and excellent response to CAR T-cell therapy despite the high and prolonged dose of steroids used to manage toxicity. Therefore, cerebral or spine edema probably represents an extreme end of the spectrum of pathophysiology underlying the more common ICANS but may have some unique mediators that have not been determined yet.",
        "Although peak CAR T-cell levels in the blood have been demonstrated to be associated with neurotoxicity, most centers do not have the ability to measure CAR T-cell expansion in real time. The ability to do so might help predict patients at risk for severe neurotoxicity, including CNS edema. There may also be value for measuring CAR levels when faced with possible delayed neurotoxicity. CAR levels appear to be abnormally high in these situations as well. Although CD19-specific CAR T-cells can be detected in the CSF of patients with neurotoxicity, they can also be detected in the CSF of patients without neurotoxicity,3,12 and their presence and quantity do not appear to be predictive of neurologic symptoms. The value of measuring CD19 CAR T-cell concentration in CSF remains unclear.",
        "In a recent study, single-cell sequencing analyses demonstrated CD19 expression on human brain mural cells, including pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and it was proposed that an on-target off-tumor effect may contribute to the neurotoxicity observed with CD19 CAR T cells.66 However, it is unclear how to reconcile this hypothesis with the occurrence of ICANS with CAR T cells targeting other antigens such as BCMA, with the limited neurotoxicities observed with some CD19 constructs. For example, patients treated with CD19 CAR T cells containing CD28 and CD3z signaling domains identical to the axi-cel but having different single-chain variable fragment and hinge and transmembrane domains had similar antilymphoma activity but much lower incidence and severity of ICANS (50% severe ICANS compared with 5% severe ICANS).67 This difference was associated with a distinct profile of cytokines (lower) in the reduced ICANS group. That ICANS symptoms are overwhelmingly transient also suggests that they are not so because of on-target off-tumor direct effects from the CAR T-cells.",
        "CANS appears most likely to be a toxic encephalopathy involving proinflammatory cytokines, excitotoxins, activation of vascular endothelium, and disruptions of the BBB. CSF during acute ICANS shows myeloid cytokines and chemokines,12 excitotoxins such as glutamate and quinolinic acid,12 and markers of glial and axonal injury,22,68 suggesting that the activation of microglial or other CNS myeloid cells with resulting CNS injury may play a role.",
        "The last case illustrates delayed toxicities and the need for a thorough workup to rule out other etiologies such as infection or tumor recurrence. BCMA-CAR T cells are associated with lower rates of ICANS, but novel neurotoxicities have been described. Reports of delayed Parkinsonism-like neurologic toxic effects have also been reported in 1% to 5% of patients treated with ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti)62 and is attributed to the potential expression of BCMA in the basal ganglia.21 Unlike ICANS, these appear to not be readily reversible, even in patients treated with pulse-dose steroid, anakinra, siltuximab, and intrathecal chemotherapy. In addition, some peripheral nerve syndromes have been described, but these appear to be readily reversible with steroids. Other tumor-associated targets in multiple myeloma are currently being studied, some of which have a broader expression outside of plasma cells and warrant careful monitoring.19",
        "Finally, based on our personal observations, rare neurologic toxicities not yet captured in the literature may occur. These include persistent severe postural tremors lasting >2 months after CAR, resembling essential tremor and effectively treated with propranolol; new migraines occurring after ICANS treatment with anakinra, managed with migraine abortive and prophylactic medications; and various peripheral neuropathies treated with steroids. Our approach is to firstly classify the toxicity based on the type with imaging and electrodiagnostic testing and then use trial medication to treat the idiopathic form of the toxicity (ie, acute demyelinating polyneuropathy would be treated with IVIG). Any patient with new mental status changes or CNS lesions arising 2 months after CAR needs neuroimaging LP with CSF analysis to rule out infections (especially JC virus, human herpesvirus 6, and cytomegalovirus) and CNS recurrence of the disease.",
        "As a relatively new treatment, rare and unexpected side effects may occur among patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy. We believe that it is important to investigate the causative mechanisms of CAR-associated neurotoxicity by including careful and systematic monitoring of these side effects in clinical trials as well as continued reporting of such cases through the development of a repository of rare findings that may ultimately increase awareness of rare presentations and advance management strategies for these challenging cases. Additional measures to better understand these events may include CAR measurement in all compartments, blood/CSF sampling/banking, and prospective high-quality–ICANS treatment trials.",

Herein, we provide an overview of the current status of bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) therapy, considering the unprecedented new indication for such therapy in combating minimal (or measurable) residual disease in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and the development of novel approaches based on this concept. Key aspects that we discuss include the current clinical data, challenges relating to treatment administration and patient monitoring, toxicities and resistance to treatment, and novel strategies to overcome these hurdles as well as to broaden the indications for BiTE therapy, particularly to common solid cancers. Elucidation of mechanisms of resistance and immune escape and new technologies used in drug development pave the way for new and more-effective therapies and rational combinatorial approaches. In particular, we highlight novel therapeutic agents, such as bifunctional checkpoint-inhibitory T cell engagers (CiTEs), simultaneous multiple interaction T cell engagers (SMITEs), trispecific killer engagers (TriKEs) and BiTE-expressing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells (CART.BiTE cells), designed to integrate various immune functions into one molecule or a single cellular vector and thereby enhance efficacy without compromising safety. We also discuss the targeting of intracellular tumour-associated epitopes using bispecific constructs with T cell receptor (TCR)-derived, rather than an antibody-based, antigen-recognition domains, termed immune-mobilizing monoclonal TCRs against cancer (ImmTACs), which might broaden the armamentarium of T cell-engaging therapies.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Bispecific T cell engager (BiTE), such as blinatumomab, has demonstrated significant clinical success in treating hematological malignancies like B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, the application of BiTEs in solid tumors has proven challenging, primarily due to the lack of targetable tumor antigens and the immunologically “cold” nature of the tumor microenvironment, which limits immune system activation. Methods We developed a novel oncolytic virus (OV) platform by engineering a chimeric vaccinia virus to express either a truncated non-signaling CD19 antigen (CD19t) or truncated B cell maturation antigen (BCMAt) on the surface of infected tumor cells. Here, we advance a combinatorial platform using an OV to redirect CD19-targeted or BCMA-targeted T cell engagers (TCEs) to drive antitumor responses against multiple solid tumors. Results We found that OV-infected tumor cells in combination with TCEs significantly improved tumor cell killing against solid tumor models, with efficacy comparable to that of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. This combination approach enhanced antitumor responses using in vivo human tumor xenograft models and promoted more effective elimination of solid tumor cells than either therapy alone. Our studies highlight OVs combined with clinically approved TCEs as a readily translatable, tumor-agnostic, off-the-shelf strategy to effectively target solid tumors. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that the combination of OV and TCEs offers a promising strategy to drive antitumor immune responses against solid tumors. This approach represents a novel and universal platform currently in phase 1 clinical trial combining TCE therapy with oncolytic virotherapy, overcoming antigen heterogeneity and immunological barriers for the effective treatment of solid tumors.",

        "These findings represent a significant advancement in the field of solid cancer treatment by introducing a readily scalable, universal off-the-shelf immunotherapy that integrates the complementary advantages of OV and TCE. This approach establishes a foundational platform for further clinical development of OV-based strategies, not only for delivering tumor-associated antigens that may be targeted by TCE, but also for other immunomodulatory payloads with the potential to enhance antitumor efficacy and improve clinical outcomes.",
        "A universal tumor-agnostic therapy remains elusive in the field of cancer immunotherapy. There have been impressive patient-specific immunotherapies with recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies. Limitations include the autologous nature of these cells and the length of time required for cellular manufacturing. In contrast to autologous CAR T cells, the benefits of bispecific T cell engagers (TCEs) are their off-the-shelf availability and the ability to acutely tune targeting with dosing regimens.1 2 TCEs have emerged as a promising immunotherapy strategy for the treatment of B-cell hematological malignancies. Blinatumomab, an FDA-approved TCE carrying CD19 and CD3 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) that drives endogenous T-cell mediated immune responses against malignant cells, has shown durable clinical responses for the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.3 4 Challenges facing solid tumor therapies using CAR T cells and TCE therapies are driven by a lack of amenable and targetable tumor antigens.5 6 The shared expression of solid tumor antigens on normal tissue and their heterogeneous, and non-uniform, expression patterns on tumors limits the potential for effective and durable antitumor responses.7 8 Many solid tumors are also immunologically “cold” and limit T cell trafficking and antitumor functionality, a phenomenon uncommonly observed in hematological malignancies.911 Thus, improved and more accessible immunotherapies remain to be explored.",
        "Oncolytic viruses (OVs) have emerged as a promising off-the-shelf treatment modality for various tumor types. OVs are tumor-specific viruses that have desirable immunogenic properties with the capacity for transgene delivery to tumors.12 We recently developed a novel combination therapy that enabled redirection of CD19-CAR T cells to solid tumors by exploiting the transgene delivery potential of a vaccinia-based OV to selectively infect and drive tumor-specific expression of a truncated non-signaling variant of CD19 (CD19t).13 The parent version of the chimeric OV used here has shown safety and antitumor activity in several preclinical models.14 15 Here, we build a fully off-the-shelf therapeutic approach using these OVs in combination with TCEs. We demonstrate robust cell surface CD19t expression on multiple tumor types infected with OV carrying the CD19t-encoding gene (OV19t), which promoted activation and tumor cell killing by T cells when treated with CD19-TCE. Importantly, this approach is not limited to CD19 and can be used with other tumor antigens including B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). We demonstrate potent antitumor activity with this combination using multiple in vivo tumor models, including efficacy in animals bearing multiple tumors following local OV administration to a single tumor site. In summary, we develop a tumor-agnostic combinatorial therapy leveraging CD19 and BCMA as proof-of-concept antigens for the combination of OVs and TCEs to target solid tumors.",
        "In this study, we evaluated a combination approach using a novel OV to induce de novo cell surface expression of tumor antigen targets on solid tumors, which in combination with off-the-shelf bispecific TCEs, redirects endogenous T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Our oncolytic vaccinia virus (VACV), CF33 carrying a truncated CD19 (CD19t) (OV19t) was previously developed in combination with CD19-CAR T cells.13 We also expanded this platform using CF33 carrying a truncated BCMA (BCMAt) (OV encoding BCMAt (OVBCMAt)), for combination with BCMA-targeting agents. All in vitro assays were performed with at least duplicate samples and were repeated in at least three independent experiments. In vivo studies were performed using 6–8 weeks old NSG, using at least three mice per group for all studies, and four to nine mice were included within each group for all therapeutic and survival studies to ensure statistical power and evenly distributed tumor sizes across groups at treatment initiation. The health condition of mice was monitored daily by the Department of Comparative Medicine at City of Hope with euthanasia applied according to the American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines. Investigators were not blinded when monitoring mouse survival. All studies were performed under approved protocols of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the institutional review board.",

The oligo (5’-GTTATAGTAGCCGCACTCG-3’) was used to synthesize single guide RNA (sgRNA) using the EnGen sgRNA Synthesis Kit (Cat#E3322S; NEB) following the manufacturer’s instruction. Next, ∼70% confluent HEK293 cells in a 24-well plate were infected with CF33 virus at an MOI of 0.1. Two hours after infection, the medium was changed with fresh DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and the cells were transfected with ribonucleoprotein complex of sgRNA and Cas9 together with the template for homologous recombination, that is, the J2R-shuttle plasmid containing BCMAt cassette. Lipofectamine CRISPRMAX transfection reagent (Cat#CMAX00008; Thermo Fisher) was used for transfection; 1250 ng of Cas9 and 240 ng sgRNA was used per well. The following day, cell lysate was collected and subjected to three rounds of freeze-thaw cycles. The lysate was then used to infect CV1 cells in six well plates and methylcellulose overlay was applied. Two days after incubation, plaques were picked and PCR verified. One more round of plaque purification was performed prior to amplification and purification of the virus on sucrose gradient. The transgene in the recombinant virus was sequence verified.",

This same process was used to engineer the expression of HER2 in MDA-MB-468. The human CD19-28z CAR lentiviral construct with truncated human epidermal growth factor receptor (hEGFRt) separated by a T2A ribosome skip sequence was used as previously described.17 18 The human BCMA-28z CAR lentiviral construct with hEGFRt separated by a T2A ribosome skip sequence was generated using BCMA scFv (clone C11D5.3; US20120082661A1), extracellular spacer domain including the 129-amino acid CH2-deleted version (ΔCH2) of the IgG4 Fc spacer, and intracellular costimulatory signaling domain containing 28z with a CD28 transmembrane domain. The human HER2-41BBz CAR lentiviral construct previously described19 was modified to remove the CD19t domain.

        "For these studies, we used the oncolytic chimeric orthopoxvirus carrying CD19t (OV19t) as previously described.13 We first assessed whether the CD19t delivered to tumors via OV could activate non-targeting T cells in the presence of blinatumomab (CD19-CD3 TCEs (CD19-TCEs) (figure 1a). MDA-MB-468 human triple-negative breast cancer tumor cells were infected with varying MOI (0, 0.00625, 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 1) of OV19t and treated with 100 ng/mL CD19-TCE. Tumor cells were then co-cultured with human PBMC-derived non-targeting T cells at an effector-to-target (E:T) ratio of 1:1. At 48 hours, T cell activation (CD69, CD137) and secretion of IFNγ and IL-2 were induced in the presence of 100 ng/mL CD19-TCE when co-cultured with OV19t-infected tumor cells in an MOI-dependent manner (figure 1b–d).",
        "We then performed in vitro cell killing assays with tumor cells infected with OV19t at MOIs of 0, 0.0125, 0.5, and 1 in combination with 0, 20, or 100 ng/mL CD19-TCE. MDA-MB-468 tumor cells stably expressing CD19t via lentiviral transduction (MDA-MB-468-CD19t) were used as a positive control. We observed robust tumor cell killing of MDA-MB-468 tumor cells infected with OV19t and co-cultured with non-targeting T cells in the presence of either 20 or 100 ng/mL CD19-TCE when compared with OV19t-infected tumors alone (figure 1e). Tumor cell killing was quantified using flow cytometry. At each time point (24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours), we observed greater killing of tumor cells infected with OV19t in the presence of CD19-TCE compared with respective controls without CD19-TCE (figure 1f). T cell-mediated tumor cell killing when co-cultured with CD19-TCE was confirmed with MDA-MB-468-CD19t (online supplemental figure 1).",
        "We confirmed the activity of this combination comparing the FDA-approved blinatumomab to research grade CD19-TCE (ProteoGenix), which demonstrated similar in vitro activity (online supplemental figure 2a-c). Therefore, research grade CD19-TCE was used for all subsequent studies. Similar tumor cell killing was observed against the OV90 cell line infected with OV19t and co-cultured with non-targeting T cells in the presence of either 20 or 100 ng/mL CD19-TCE when compared with OV19t-infected tumors alone (online supplemental figure 3). Importantly, CD19t expression was significantly reduced in tumor cells with CD19-TCE, showing on-target activity (figure 1g). Additional solid tumor cell lines including PC3 (prostate), U87 (glioma), and SNU-16 (gastric) were tested using this combination therapy and demonstrated similar advantages in activation, cytokine secretion, tumor cell killing, and targeting of CD19t expressing cells (online supplemental figure 4). Taken together, our data suggest that CD19-TCE redirects T cell-mediated activation and antitumor activity against OV19t-infected tumor cells.",
        "To expand on potential targets that can be used within this combinatorial strategy, we developed a new oncolytic chimeric orthopoxvirus expressing a novel BCMAt target under the control of a synthetic early promoter that allowed for immediate surface target expression. BCMAt was inserted into the J2R locus encoding thymidine kinase as was done for CD19t (figure 2a). We demonstrated the ability of OVBCMAt to effectively deliver and generate cell surface expression of BCMAt on multiple solid tumor cell lines (figure 2b). To evaluate the antitumor activity of OVBCMAt in combination with BCMA-CAR T cells in vivo, we treated NSG mice bearing subcutaneous MDA-MB-468 tumors with a single intratumoral injection of 106 pfu OVBCMAt. 7 days after OVBCMAt treatment, tumors were harvested and demonstrated high expression of BCMAt (online supplemental figure 5a). Therefore, mice were systemically treated with BCMA-CAR T cells on day 7 following OVBCMAt treatment and tumor volumes were monitored. Mice treated with OVBCMAt alone delayed tumor growth as expected, but we observed marked tumor regression with the combination of OVBCMAt and BCMA-CAR T cells (online supplemental figure 5b).",
        "Using OVBCMAt, we next assessed whether BCMAt delivered to tumors activated BCMA-CAR T cells or non-targeting T cells in the presence of teclistamab (BCMA-TCE). MDA-MB-468 triple-negative breast cancer tumor cells were infected with varying MOIs of OVBCMAt, and BCMA-TCE was added at a concentration of 100 µg/mL. These tumor cells were then co-cultured with BCMA-CAR T cells or non-targeting T cells at an E:T ratio of 1:1 for 24 hours. Cell surface expression of 4-1BB (CD137) was used as a marker of T cell activation and quantified via flow cytometry. At 24 hours, BCMA-CAR T cells and non-targeting T cells in combination with BCMA-TCE demonstrated activation against OVBCMAt infected tumor cells in an MOI-dependent manner compared with respective controls without BCMA-TCE (figure 2c). To further quantify the T cell activation in the presence of BCMA-TCE, supernatants from co-cultures were collected to evaluate T cell-dependent cytokine production. At 24 hours, IFNγ and IL-2 secretion were detected in an MOI-dependent manner (online supplemental figure 6). We quantified killing of tumor cells when co-cultured with OVBCMAt and BMCA-CAR T cells or non-targeting T cells with BCMA-TCE using flow cytometry. At 24 hours, we observed enhanced killing of tumor cells infected with OVBCMAt and co-cultured with non-targeting T cells in the presence of BCMA-TCE (figure 2c). In addition, we validated the ability of BCMA-TCE to specifically redirect non-targeting T cells to BCMAt-expressing tumor cells following OVBCMAt expression and found that the percent BCMAt expression was significantly reduced in wells with teclistamab (figure 2c). Additionally, we tested this combination in vitro against two other solid tumor cell lines SNU16 (gastric) and OV90 (ovarian). Following 24 hours co-culture, we demonstrated enhanced activation, tumor cell killing, and BCMAt targeting in the presence of BCMA-TCE similar to BCMA-CAR T cells (figure 2d–e).",
        "OV has been previously shown to augment infiltration of T cells and other immune cells into tumors inducing endogenous antitumor immunity.21 Therefore, we assessed the tumor trafficking of engrafted T cells lentivirally transduced to stably express ffluc (Tc-ffluc) following OV19t infection with or without CD19-TCE treatment in MDA-MB-468 xenograft model. We treated NSG mice bearing subcutaneous MDA-MB-468 tumors with a single intratumoral injection of 106 pfu OV19t as previously described.13 Two days after OV19t treatment, we engrafted Tc-ffluc with 5×106 cells per mouse. 4 days after Tc-ffluc transfer, mice were treated intravenously with CD19-TCE (8 µg/dose) or PBS for 5 consecutive days (Monday–Friday) and then 3 consecutive days (Monday–Wednesday) the following week for a total of 64 µg/mouse (figure 3a). The combination of OV19t, Tc-ffluc, and CD19-TCE again exhibited significant tumor regression (figure 3b). Interestingly, OV19t and CD19-TCE combination treatment induced significantly higher influx of non-targeting T cells compared with PBMC-ffluc alone or PBMC-ffluc with OV19t alone (figure 3c–d). These data suggest that CD19-TCE redirects T cells to target CD19t, enabling tumor infiltration of endogenous T cells to target and kill tumors expressing CD19t induced by OV19t infection.",
        "To evaluate the antitumor activity of OV19t in combination with CD19-TCE in vivo, we treated NSG mice bearing subcutaneous MDA-MB-468 tumors with a single intratumoral injection of 106 pfu OV19t. Two days after OV19t treatment, we collected PBMCs from a healthy human donor and engrafted with 5×106 cells per mouse. 4 days after PBMC transfer, mice were treated intravenously with CD19-TCE (8 µg/dose) or PBS for 5 consecutive days (Monday–Friday) and then 3 consecutive days (Monday–Wednesday) the following week for a total of 64 µg/mouse (figure 4a). Over the course of 2 weeks, MDA-MB-468 tumor-bearing mice treated with PBMCs alone or PBMCs and CD19-TCE showed no tumor control. Notably, mice treated with OV19t and PBMCs or OV19t and CD19-TCE slowed tumor growth as expected with OV19t alone, but we observed marked tumor regression with the combination of OV19t, PBMCs, and CD19-TCE (figure 4b, online supplemental figure 7). Similarly, antitumor responses were validated using OVBCMAt in combination with BCMA-TCE in vivo (figure 4c,d, online supplemental figure 8). These studies highlight the therapeutic efficacy of combining OV and TCE in preclinical models.",
        "To evaluate the potential for targeting non-OV-injected tumors with the combination, we treated NSG mice bearing dual subcutaneous MDA-MB-468 tumors on opposing flanks (left and right side) with a single intratumoral injection of 106 pfu OV19t to the right tumor only (figure 4e). MDA-MB-468 tumor-bearing mice treated with PBMCs alone, PBMCs with BCMA-TCE, and PBMCs with CD19-TCE in the absence of OV19t showed no tumor control. Importantly, in mice treated with OV19t to only one tumor site, we observed antitumor responses in both tumor sites in the presence of PBMCs and CD19-TCE. Other treatment groups demonstrated predictable antitumor responses only at the OV-treated site (figure 4f,g, online supplemental figures 9,10). Both the right and left flank subcutaneous tumors were harvested on day 58 (24 days post-OV19t treatment). Immunohistochemistry analysis of the right flank (OV-treated) tumor demonstrated equivalent VACV presence in BCMA-TCE or CD19-TCE treated groups. However, treatment with OV and CD19-TCE resulted in significant increases in VACV presence in the untreated tumor site (online supplemental figure 11). To further confirm the CD19 specificity of the observed efficacy, we treated MDA-MB-468 tumors (lentivirally transduced to stably express CD19t, termed MDA-MB-468-CD19t) on opposing flanks with either CD19-TCE or BCMA-TCE as a non-targeting TCE control. Both the right and left tumors demonstrated tumor regression in mice treated with CD19-TCE, but not in groups treated with BCMA-TCE (online supplemental figure 12). This experiment was repeated using U251T as the tumor model and observed similar antitumor efficacy on both the treated and non-OV-injected tumors (figure 4h–j). These data demonstrate the potent antitumor efficacy of the OV19t and CD19-TCE combination approach, and the potential for targeting multifocal disease following intratumoral administration of OV.",
        "To evaluate if CD19-TCE preloaded onto a non-targeting T cell has the same antitumor efficacy as T cells exposed to CD19-TCE in culture, we co-cultured MDA-MB-468 tumor cells infected with varying MOIs of OV19t and non-targeting T cells. To appropriate wells, 100 ng/mL CD19-TCE and 1:1 E:T with non-targeting T cells, 1:1 E:T of non-targeting T cells preloaded with 10 µg/mL CD19-TCE, or CD19-CAR T cells were added in a tumor killing assay. CD19-TCE preloading was confirmed prior to co-culture with tumor targets by evaluating binding of protein L and blocking of anti-CD3 antibody binding using flow cytometry. We demonstrated reduction of anti-CD3 antibody binding while confirming approximately 95–97% protein L binding on T cells preloaded with 10 µg/mL and thus continued all preloading experiments with a concentration of 10 µg/mL (figure 5a). Additionally, we performed a time course study over 72 hours to determine CD19-TCE binding, activation, and exhaustion following preloading of T cells. Anti-CD3 antibody binding increased (data not shown) most likely due to proliferation of T cells with newly expressed CD3 molecules following activation while protein L expression remained high over 72 hours (figure 5b left). After 4 hours of culturing following preloading of T cells with CD19-TCE, there was an initial increase in activation marker (CD137) but decreased over 72 hours (figure 5b right). There was a slight increase in immune checkpoint markers (TIM3, LAG3, and PD-1) at 24 hours, but decreased over 72 hours (online supplemental figure 13).",
        "After 24 hours in culture with OV19t infected MDA-MB-468 tumor cells, we observed an increase in CD137 of preloaded non-targeting T cells when compared with non-targeting T cells with CD19-TCE added in culture and CD19-CAR T cells when assessed by flow cytometry (figure 5c left). CD137 expression remained higher among preloaded T cells at 48 hours as well (online supplemental figure 14a). We quantified T cell killing ability against MDA-MB-468 tumor cells infected with OV19t using flow cytometry. At 24 and 48 hours, we observed greater killing of non-targeting T cells with CD19-TCE in culture, CD19-TCE preloaded non-targeting T cells, and CD19-CAR T cells than OV19t with non-targeting T cells alone (figure 5c middle and online supplemental figure 14b). Furthermore, targeting of CD19t expression following OV19t infection by CD19-TCE was confirmed when comparing expression to co-cultured wells in the absence of CD19-TCE (figure 5c right and online supplemental figure 14c). This data suggests that the presence of CD19-TCE, both pre-loaded onto T cells or suspended in culture with T cells, and CD19-CAR T cells elicit comparable antitumor activity against OV19t infected solid tumors in vitro.",
        "To determine whether CD19-TCE in combination with OV19t could further improve the targeting of a CAR T cell onto a tumor with heterogenous expression patterns of an existing CAR antigen, we co-cultured MDA-MB-468 triple-negative breast cancer cells with 80% of the cells belonging to the parental line and 20% of cells expressing the CAR targetable HER2 antigen (MDA-MB-468-HER2 was lentivirally transduced to stably express HER2). We then treated wells with varying MOIs of OV19t and added HER2 CAR T cells with or without CD19-TCE. These cells were co-cultured for 1–6 days, which were rechallenged as shown in figure 5d. At 24 hours, OV19t and HER2 CAR T cells showed comparable killing to OV19t with HER2 CAR T cells and CD19-TCE while CD137 expression was significantly higher in the presence of CD19-TCE (online supplemental figure 15a). At 48 hours, CD19-TCE in combination with HER2 CAR T cells demonstrated higher killing and activation but similar CD19t targeting (online supplemental figure 1b). When wells were rechallenged with antigen-negative MDA-MB-468 tumor cells (not expressing HER2), the combinatorial treatment of OV19t, HER2 CAR T cells, and CD19-TCE showed additive and synergistic tumor cell killing when compared with OV19t and HER2 CAR T cells alone (figure 5d). Wells were then rechallenged once more with antigen-negative MDA-MB-468 tumor cells and again showed improved tumor cell killing when a combinatorial approach using OV19t, HER2 CAR T cells, and CD19-TCE. We demonstrated greater tumor cell killing, CD19t targeting, and T cell count at the lowest MOI (0.003125) (figure 5e). This data suggests that using OV19t to deliver a CD19-TCE-targetable antigen can be combined with existing CAR T cells to elicit dual-targeting of heterogeneous tumors.",
        "We previously developed a novel combination therapy for solid tumors by delivering a CD19t antigen with an OV followed by CD19-CAR T cells to mitigate antigen heterogeneity and elicit an immunologically warm tumor microenvironment (TME).13 Since our original report, other groups have demonstrated similar approaches to redirecting CAR or other therapeutic modalities to target de novo tumor antigens using OV.2225 In our approach, tumor antigens encoded by the OV are expressed under the control of an early promoter, enabling rapid antigen presentation. This strategy is designed to potentially minimize early immune-mediated clearance of OV while facilitating antigen-directed mechanisms that enhance viral dissemination within the TME. We now demonstrate the ability of OV to deliver CD19t or BCMA to solid tumors that enable targeting with bispecific TCEs to induce endogenous T cell activation and antitumor responses in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that local OV treatment combined with TCE allows for targeting of multiple tumors that are not directly injected with OV in two xenograft tumor models. While the mechanism of action warrants further investigation, our findings suggest improved spread of OV to untreated tumors following the combination therapy due to increased viral release from the CD19-TCE targeted tumors that have been infected with OV19t. The current findings support a fully off-the-shelf therapeutic combination with immediate clinical applications. Further, we demonstrate that this paradigm can be advanced with two clinically active TCEs, with the prospect of additional tumor antigens that may be exploited for this combinatorial immunotherapy strategy.",
        "Use of TCE rather than a CAR T cell carries several key advantages. Given the cost and length of time required to generate patient-specific CD19-CAR T cells, we reasoned that the availability of off-the-shelf immunotherapies overcomes time restraints for patients undergoing treatment. With current manufacturing practices and capacities, the demand for CAR T cells exceeds supply and is still viewed as a niche technology that not all sites can perform.26 Moreover, TCEs such as blinatumomab or teclistamab provide a safety advantage over CAR T cells due to the nature of their short in vivo half-life and dosing strategies.27 28 This treatment can then be suspended or delayed if needed, with the potential for reversing unfavorable immune-related adverse events. This could expand readily to other targets where TCEs are being developed, including CD20, HER2, PSMA, and others. Importantly, the proof-of-concept phase one trial for the combination therapy using OV19t and blinatumomab is underway (NCT06063317).",
        "Numerous trials are currently being investigated for the treatment of solid tumors with CAR T cells, targeting solid tumors that express HER2, GD2, PSMA, Claudin 18.2, and others.29 While the benefits of these approaches have yet to be fully clinically investigated, our off-the-shelf approach OV and TCE for the treatment of solid tumors may be used in combination with existing CAR T cell therapies. To that end, we show in vitro that CAR T cells can be combined with OV and TCE to improve tumor cell killing. One potential application of this combination is the ex vivo preloading of CAR T cells with CD19-TCE, enabling their use alongside OV19t without the need for direct administration of TCEs to patients. Further studies, including in vivo assessment, are warranted to better understand how this combination with existing CAR T cell strategies can be employed to overcome tumor antigen heterogeneity.",
        "A limitation of the current study is the lack of testing in immunocompetent mouse models. While we were able to perform syngeneic studies in our prior work combining OV19t with CD19-CAR T cells, issues with access to the murine versions of CD19-TCEs and BCMA-TCEs limited our ability to perform such studies in the current work. These studies will be of interest given the biodistribution profile of TCEs compared with CAR T cells, the ability to agonize endogenous T cells with anti-CD3, and a model for which safety concerns might be addressed. Importantly, a recent study demonstrated the safety of CD19-TCE in syngeneic tumor models where CD19 was stably expressed on tumor cells.30 While blinatumomab has been widely used in clinic for the treatment of hematological malignancies, reports of various toxicities with targeting CD19 in patients, including cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicities,31 suggest that this combinatorial strategy could employ alternate antigen targets, such as BCMA, which may have a more favorable safety profile.28 To that end, we generated OV carrying a novel BCMAt molecule and demonstrated the ability to redirect teclistamab to OVBCMAt-infected tumors. The use of either OV19t or OVBCMAt in this combination may be dictated by several features including disease setting, for instance in glioblastoma, where mitigation of potential neurological side effects would be highly desirable. Importantly, the initial decision to target these two B-cell-related antigens was multi-fold, as compared with other known tumor antigens including HER2, one may envision a benefit of targeting B cells in cancer as they may contribute to suppressing antitumor immunity.32 Furthermore, immunocompetent mouse models may provide a more accurate representation of the antitumor efficacy observed in the non-OV treated tumors. The viral spread to the contralateral untreated tumors seen in the current studies may not occur at lower OV doses or in less-permissive tumor types. While we have shown that numerous solid tumor cell lines are susceptible to OV infection, some remain resistant, which may limit therapeutic benefits of this combination. Our ongoing phase one clinical trial evaluating OV19t in combination with the CD19-TCE will provide further insight into the variability of OV infection across patient populations. These findings may inform future patient screening strategies to optimize therapeutic activity.",
        "In summary, we have successfully developed a clinically viable, tumor-agnostic, combinatorial immunotherapy using OV to deliver TCE targets for the off-the-shelf treatment of solid tumors.",

        "Natural products can effectively enhance the therapeutic outcome and expand indications of cancer immunotherapies, including cancer vaccines, immune-checkpoint inhibitors, and adoptive immune-cells transfer therapy, through remodeling tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment.Image 1",
        "Cancer immunotherapy has become an irreversible trend herald in the field of cancer therapy and is regarded as the fourth type of anti-tumor treatment after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy due to the obvious efficacy and low side effects1,2. This kind of breakthrough therapy is defined that regulates immunological response through activating the organism's immune defense system or action of biological compounds to suppress and prevent tumor growth2. Up to now, 7 types of immune-checkpoint inhibitors, 2 kinds of adoptive immune-cell immunotherapies, and 4 types of cancer vaccines for anti-cancer treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Fig. 1)3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.Figure 1Cancer immunotherapies approved by the FDA.Figure 1",
        "Cancer immunotherapies approved by the FDA.",
        "Despite cancer immunotherapy has achieved numerous remarkable advances so far, its indications still focus on several types of tumors that are sensitive to the immune system (also named as “hot tumor”), such as metastatic melanoma, urothelial carcinoma, and prostate cancer10, 11, 12. For the tumor with poor immunogenicities (also named as “cold tumor”) like triple-negative breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer, there is almost no significant efficiency of cancer immunotherapy13. And the main reason resulting in this limitation is the immunosuppressive microenvironment within tumor sites (Fig. 2A), which can assist tumor cells in immune escape and even promote its growth14,15. As shown in Fig. 2B, the hot tumors can normally express tumor-specific antigens and the immune system can distinguish these antigens and then effectively kill tumor cells with the assistance of immunotherapy16. But for cold tumors, they will establish their unique immunosuppressive microenvironment against the recognition and attack from the immune system13,14,17, 18, 19. And this microenvironment can effectively passivate cancer immunotherapy. For example, although the number and activity of effective T cells (Teffs) can be increased and improved by cancer vaccines or immune-checkpoint inhibitors, the cold tumor cells still can weaken Teffs’ activities through immunosuppressive cells like regulatory T cells (Tregs) and immunosuppressive factors, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-13, IL-16, prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) and so on16,19. Therefore, effective strategies that can reverse and remodel the complex immunosuppressive microenvironment within tumors become the key element for cancer immunotherapy to expand its indications.Figure 2Tumor-associated immunosuppressive microenvironments and immunotherapy: (A) tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment.

        "Natural products, which refer to the compounds extracted and/or optimized from nature, have shown great potential in the field of cancer immunotherapy due to their multi-target regulated abilities in recent years20, 21, 22, 23. It has been found that they can effectively enhance the therapeutic outcome and expand indications of all kinds of cancer immunotherapies, including cancer vaccines, immune-checkpoint inhibitors, and adoptive immune-cells transfer therapy24, 25, 26. In addition, there are also some clinical trials about natural products combined with immunotherapy that have been approved by the FDA (Table 1). Besides, natural products have achieved huge success in the discovery of anti-tumor agents27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. About 47% of anti-tumor agents are derived from naturally occurring compounds33, 34, 35. Because of the multi-benefits of natural products on anti-tumor and immunomodulatory fields, it has shown great potential to become qualified adjuvants for tumor immunotherapy.Table 1List of clinical trials about natural products combined with cancer immunotherapy.Table 1NCT numberNatural productCaner immunotherapyDiseaseStatusPhaseNCT03192059CurcuminPembrolizumabCervical cancer/Endometrial cancer/Uterine cancerRecruitingIINCT00470574QS-21Sialyl lewisa-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate vaccineBreast cancerCompleted–NCT00036933QS-21MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccineProstate cancerCompletedINCT00004929QS-21MUC-2-KLH vaccineProstate cancerCompletedINCT00005632QS-21MUC1-KLH vaccineProstate cancerCompletedINCT00003357OS-21GM2-KLH vaccineBreast cancerCompletedINCT00003819QS-21TF(c)-KLH conjugate vaccineProstate cancerCompletedINCT00004156QS-21MUC1-KLH vaccineBreast cancerCompletedINCT00030823QS-21Globo-H-GM2-Lewis-y-MUC1-32(aa)-sTn(c)-Tn(c)-KLH conjugate vaccineBreast cancerCompleted–NCT00006041QS-21MUC1-KLH vaccineFallopian tube cancer/Ovarian cancer/Primary peritoneal cavity cancerCompletedINCT00006387QS-21Ras-peptide cancer vaccineColorectal cancer/Pancreatic cancerCompletedINCT00001572QS-21Id-KLH vaccineB cell lymphoma/Follicular lymphoma/NeoplasmCompletedINCT00004052QS-21BCR‒ABL peptide vaccineLeukemiaCompletedIINCT00857545Saponin-based immunoadjuvant OBI-821Polyvalent antigen-KLH conjugate vaccineOvarian epithelial cancer/Fallopian tube cancer/Peritoneal cancerCompletedII‒Not applicable.",

        "This review collects and generalizes the newly obtained studies about how natural products expand indications and enhance the efficiency of cancer immunotherapies through remodeling tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. Firstly, the antagonistic relationship between tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and current cancer immunotherapies has been elaborated. Next, as for the three types of tumor immunotherapies approved by the FDA, the information about how natural products improve these three treatments through multi-cells and multi-pathways moderating effects have been provided in this part. Then, the effective nano-drug delivery system designed to overcome the shortages of natural products also are exhibited and discussed. And this multi-targeted immune sensitized effect of natural products is summarized in the last part.",
        "For the current cancer immunotherapies, their efficiencies mainly depend on the function of Teffs, which play the central role in the anti-tumor effect of the immune system. However, the existence of the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment weakens the Teffs’ activities. Therefore, a deep understanding of the immunosuppressive microenvironment will help to find the key elements for improving the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy. And this inhibition of Teffs induced by the immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumors can be concluded into three main aspects: poor immunogenicity, Immunological checkpoints, and immunosuppressive factors and cells12.",
        "The most significant basis for the elimination of tumor cells by the immune system is enough immunogenicity, which mainly depends on the number of tumor-specific antigens (TSA) that express on the surface of tumor cells (Fig. 2B). It is also the straightforward reason that results in limited clinical benefits of cancer immunotherapy for poorly immunogenic (cold) tumors compares to immunogenic (hot) tumors36,37. TSAs are usually induced by tumor-specific mutations. The lack of antigenic mutations will cause the lack of recognition by T cells for tumor cells38.",
        "Moreover, tumor cells can also prevent the TSAs-presenting process to the surface of tumor cells by the restriction of major histocompatibility complex class (MHC) through altering some elements in the TSAs presenting procedure, including proteasomes and transporters related to antigen processing (TAP), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) or MHC39. Either lack of antigenic mutations or alternations in the antigen-presenting process may result in the “off-target” effect of T cell-based cancer immunotherapy.",
        "Even though Teffs can recognize and bind to tumor cells, tumor cells still can utilize the immunological checkpoints (ICTs) to avoid the attack of Teffs (Fig. 2C). The ICT is the other important aspect of tumor cells for interrupting Teffs’ function40. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is the first explored immunological checkpoint in previous studies and named as the “brake” of Teffs responses. The affinity between it and B7 costimulatory molecules is much higher than that between CD28 and Teffs, and thus it can effectively terminate the activation of Teffs41, 42, 43, 44. The other immunological checkpoints, programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1), also can inhibit the activity of Teffs for tumor cells40. The PD-L1 overexpression in tumor cells will also passivate the therapeutic outcomes of immunotherapy45. And there are increasing the number of immune-check points, such as T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3), B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), and Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) have been reported in these years.",
        "Besides poor immunogenicity and the inhibition of ICTs, the immunosuppressive cells and factors also limit the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy (Fig. 2D). Immunosuppressive cells mainly consist of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer T cells (NKTs), mast cells, and tumor invading lymphocytes (Fig. 4). And these cells can weave an immunosuppressive network through the secretion of immunosuppressive factors, such as IL-10, PGE2, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Besides, some compounds in TME also can induce immunosuppression, such as H+, NO, and polyamine oxide.Figure 3Immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect induced by natural products. Natural products (A. Capsaicin; B. Ginsenoside Rg3; C. Resveratrol; D. Quercetin: Alantolactone=1:4; E. Shikonin) induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect through damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin (CRT), heat shock proteins (HSPs), and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), to increase the tumor immunogenicity and make the tumor cells into “therapeutic vaccines”.Figure 3Figure 4Saponins improve the therapeutic effect of cancer vaccines as adjuvants.Figure 4",

        "Saponins improve the therapeutic effect of cancer vaccines as adjuvants.",
        "Tumor cells can induce the non-degranulated mode of mast cells through secretion of H+, NO, chondroitin sulfate, and oxidized polyamines46, 47, 48, 49. And this mode can make mast cells promote the growth of the tumor and induce immunosuppression50. In addition, the histamine, TGF-β, and IL-10 secreted from mast cells will inhibit activities of Teffs51, 52, 53. Besides, mast cells also can affect the migration and function of DCs through secreting PGE2, indirectly enhancing the immunosuppression of tumors54. In addition, MDSCs in tumor also will secret TGF-β and IL-10 to inhibit Teffs’ activities51,53.",
        "Moreover, tumor cells also secret macrophage-derived chemokines, C–C motif chemokine 22 (CCL22), to recruit monocytes into tumors and these monocytes will finally differentiate into TAMs under the condition of immunosuppressive factors55,56. TAMs are also an important part of solid tumors and almost 40% of non-malignant cells are TAMs in some kind of tumors55. These cells will transform into M2 immunosuppressive phenotype under the function of tumor-derived cytokines, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), galectin-1, gangliosides, TGF-β, PGE2, and IL-1057,58. Meanwhile, IL-10, TGF-β, and VEGF will inhibit the antigen presentation process of DCs. Then, the IL-10 also can recruit Tregs, which is a key factor to maintain immune tolerance, and Tregs will induce Teffs lymphocyte lysis through several ways like secreting TGF-β59. In addition, IL-13 secreted from NKTs within TME will also promote the secretion of TGF-β, thereby inhibiting the function of Teffs60.",
        "As mentioned above, it can be concluded that the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment is a complex network within tumor sites to help tumor cells escape from the recognition and attack of the immune system, especially for the Teffs. Therefore, finding effective agents to remodel this unique microenvironment and reactivate Teffs’ function become the key element for cancer immunotherapy. Natural products have shown great potential in remodeling tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment to improve the therapeutic outcome of cancer immunotherapy.",
        "The cancer vaccines, including cancer-preventive vaccines and cancer-therapeutic vaccines, belong to one of the cancer-specific active immunotherapies. Cancer-preventive vaccines mainly fight virus infection through the induction of specific antibodies and long-lived memory B lymphocyte cells. Some of them, especially for those containing attenuated pathogens, also can trigger cellular immunity61. Except for HPV vaccines (GRADASIL® and CERVARIX®) are cancer-preventive vaccines, most cancer vaccines belong to therapeutic vaccines, such as PROVENGE®62. These vaccines kill malignant cells mainly through inducing CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes induced by TSAs63,64.",
        "The presenting processes of TSAs in cancer vaccines is a complex process, and the effect of cancer vaccines depends on the optimized combination of antigens, adjuvant, carrier, and vaccination routes. In addition to effectively activating CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, cancer vaccines must face the following two challenges: poor immunogenicity and tumor-associated immunosuppression65,66.",
        "Immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect is a kind of cell apoptotic pathways, which can induce cancer cell death routine mainly depend on damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as calreticulin (CRT), heat shock proteins (HSPs), and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and markedly enhance the immunogenicity of these dying tumor cells67,68 (Fig. 3). ICD effect can make cancer cells into “therapeutic vaccines” that can induce anti-tumor immunity without any additional adjuvants69.",
        "Up to now, only a limited number of agents can induce ICD70. Capsaicin, the pungent alkaloid of chili pepper, reportedly could trigger the ICD effect in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells through the induction of DAMPs exposure, including HSP90 and calreticulin71 (Fig. 3A). Besides, it also could activate the DCs through binding to vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1)72. And this counteraction effect of immune suppression on DCs in PEL microenvironments has been proved in this study. Moreover, capsaicin could induce apoptotic and pro-survival autophagy through reducing signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, which depends on down-regulating the expression of Induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1 (MCL-1), a kind of anti-apoptosis molecules. And similar results were also be found in several solid and hematological tumors73, 74, 75, 76.",
        "Ginsenoside Rg3, a saponin from ginseng, is reported that could induce the significance of ICD both in immunogenic tumor-like melanoma (B16F10) and non-immunogenic tumor-like Lewis lung cancer (LLC, Fig. 3B)77. The ICD effect induced by Rg3 could increase the expression of CRT and HSP60, which are chaperone proteins and ICD markers, on the surface of B16F10 and LLC cells. In addition, within the “eat me” signal of CRT, DCs took up the decries of dead tumor cells treated by Rg3 more easily than normal tumor cells. Furthermore, the Rg3-induced ICD effect could enhance interferon γ (IFN-γ) secretion to inhibit tumor growth.",
        "Resveratrol, a non-flavonoid polyphenol widely distributed in the leaves and skins of grapes, also be verified that could induce ICD effect in ovarian carcinoma cells78 (Fig. 3C). And related studies showed that the cell surface exposure of CRT and HMGB1 were markedly increased in this kind of cell line. Besides, the effect of cancer vaccines of resveratrol has also been found in tumor rat models, in which subcutaneous injection of ID8 cells pre-treated by resveratrol could dramatically decrease the volume of tumors. Moreover, resveratrol also significantly inhibited the secretion of TGF-β while promotes the numbers of IL12 and IFN-γ.",
        "Zhang et al.79 found the injection of quercetin and alantolactone at a molar ratio of 1:4 could induce ICD in the microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (CRC) model (Fig. 3D). Their results showed this combination could induce the number of CRT exposed on the tumor cells member and HMGB1 release. In this combination, they found the injection of alantolactone alone could induce the ICD effect and quercetin could enhance this effect through modulating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interfering with protein kinase (also known as “AKT”) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathways80. Moreover, it also could inhibit the secretion of IL-10, TGF-β, IL-1β, and CCL2. And the long-term anti-tumor immune-memory effects of this combination also were found in this study.",
        "Besides making tumor cells be “therapeutic cancer vaccines”, the ICD effect also can enhance the curative effect of DCs-based tumor vaccines. Shikonin, a natural tea quinone pigment from Lithospermum erythrorhizon, has been reported to be an adjuvant for DCs-based cancer vaccines via the induction of ICD effect81 (Fig. 3E). It can effectively trigger mitochondria-associated apoptosis and promote the release of HSP70, HSP78, HSP90, CRT, and HMGB1 in melanoma cells. Besides, shikonin also improves the expressions of CD86 and MHC II and finally enhanced tumor immunogenicity to promote the efficacy of shikonin-treated B16 tumor cells- or doxorubicin-treated B16 tumor cells-loaded DCs vaccines82. In addition, Lin et al.82 also reported shikonin would enhance tumor-immunogenicity of tumor vaccines by ICD.",
        "Therefore, the ICD effect induced by natural products not only can enhance the immunogenicity of tumor cells, which makes tumor cells into “therapeutic vaccines”, but also improve the curative effect of DCs-based tumor vaccines. Meanwhile, these natural products also can downregulate the secretion of immunosuppressive factors, such as IL-10, TGF-β, IL-1β, and CCL2, and upregulate the secretion of anti-tumor factors, like IFN-γ and IL12.",
        "Most the cancer vaccines, especially peptide-based and gene-based vaccines, have poor immune-stimulate effects and should combine with rational adjuvants to achieve ideal effects. And immunosuppressive factors and cells will also inhibit the therapeutic effects of cancer vaccines. However, in previous studies, natural products as adjuvants for vaccines could effectively enhance the immune-stimulate effect and reverse the immunosuppression induced by associated factors and cells.",
        "Saponins may be the most extensively reporting vaccine-adjuvants (Fig. 4), which could punch pores on cell membranes that allow antigens to access into cells, presented by MHC I, and finally increase the number of Teffs83. QS-21, an active compound from Quillaja Saponaria Molina, is the most promising saponin immunological adjuvant for cancer vaccines. It can promote the antigen presentation process and enhance the production of Teffs. It also can remodel the immunosuppression through regulating Th1 cytokines, including IL-2 and IFN-γ. Up to now, a series of phase I‒III clinical trials investigate the therapeutic outcomes of utilizing QS-21 as immunological adjuvants of cancer vaccines designed for lymphoma, leukemia, carcinoma, and cancers of breast, prostate, ovary, or lung84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92. As Fig. 4A shown, QS-21 consists of two principal isomeric molecular constituents and the immunological effect of it mainly attributed to its aldehyde groups and acyl chains. Its aldehyde groups can stimulate the adjuvant activity because they may format Schiff bases with free amino groups on the cell membrane of related immune cells93. And the acyl chains can induce cytotoxic T-cell proliferation94. Besides, three new QS-21 derivatives (SQS-0101, SQS-0102, and SQS-0103) also been reported to improve the stability and potent adjuvant activity of natural QS-2195, 96, 97. According to the advantages of saponins in tumor-vaccines adjuvant, more natural saponins had been investigated for the adjuvant of cancer vaccines. Castro-Díaz et al.98 demonstrated CS5, a new kind of saponins from Crocus sativus corms, which could enhance the production of specific antibodies of protein-based cancer vaccines. They also found the co-stimulatory immunity of CS5 is mainly attributed to its unique acyl group, which also could form Schiff bases with amino groups of immune cells membrane. Zhang et al.99 used Astragalus saponins as an adjuvant for protein-based vaccines and they found it was efficient in stimulating both humoral and cellular immune responses, especially for cellular immune. And the levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 were significantly enhanced by these saponins to improve the antitumor immunity. Ginsenoside Rg1, the well-known saponins from ginseng, was reported to activate the PBMC-derived DCs through promoting the tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-6100. And the mechanism of Rg1 in promoting the activation of DCs was probably through modulating the NF-κB pathway in DCs. This activation is often correlated with the vaccine adjuvants' action. Wu et al.101 reported that RelB‒/‒ mice could not develop DC cells due to the genetic defect of NF-κB, which revealed the importance of this pathway for DCs. Then, O'Sullivan et al.102 indicated the importance of NF-κB activation in Teffs activation by DCs and this function would be enhanced if NF-κB activation in DCs is prolonged. Therefore, the regulation of NF-κB plays a critical role in the induction of mature DCs and that is the key point for the adjuvant activation of Rg1.",
        "Besides, some natural products, which can down-regulate the NF-κB signaling pathway, have also been reported that can sensitize cancer vaccines, but the target issues mainly focus on tumor cells. Kamat et al.103 found curcumin has the potential to improve the therapeutic outcome of bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccines, which is the golden standard immune therapy of bladder cancer, through inhibiting NF-κB and TRAIL pathways in cancer cells (Fig. 5A). Lu et al.104 also reported that curcumin could significantly enhance the effect of the TRP2 peptide vaccine for melanoma. Besides, they found curcumin would decrease the number of immune-suppressive cells (MDSCs and Tregs) in TME by inhibiting the Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT3 signal pathway. In addition, curcumin has been reported could suppress the expression of IDO by blocking the JAK‒STAT1 signaling pathway and it sensitizes the FAPαc vaccine for melanoma through this mechanism105,106. Wei et al.107 found the adjuvant effect of low dosages (1 μg/mL) of Dioscorea polysaccharides for DNA vaccines. Their results showed Dioscorea. polysaccharides could effectively enhance the anti-tumor effect of DNA vaccines for melanoma through the NF-κB inhibition of tumor cells.Figure 5Natural products improve the therapeutic effect of cancer vaccines as adjuvants. (A) Curcumin and dioscorea polysaccharides sensitize cancer vaccines by down-regulating NF-κB signaling pathway in tumor cells. (B) Polysaccharides enhance the efficiency of cancer vaccines. (C) λ-Carrageenan, rutin, and uncarinic acid C sensitive cancer vaccines through TLR4 pathway.Figure 5",
        "Natural products improve the therapeutic effect of cancer vaccines as adjuvants. (A) Curcumin and dioscorea polysaccharides sensitize cancer vaccines by down-regulating NF-κB signaling pathway in tumor cells. (B) Polysaccharides enhance the efficiency of cancer vaccines. (C) λ-Carrageenan, rutin, and uncarinic acid C sensitive cancer vaccines through TLR4 pathway.",
        "Polysaccharides is the other category of natural products that reportedly sensitize cancer vaccines (Fig. 5B). β-Glucans, the glucose polymers linked together by a 1→3 linear β-glycosidic chain core, is an active compound of polysaccharides for the immune sensitized effect108. It could bind to some immune receptors, such as dectin-1, complement receptor 3, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) -2/6, and activate various immune cells. Some polysaccharides, which rich in β-glucans like Dioscorea polysaccharides, have been reported as potential adjuvants for cancer vaccines. Chang et al.109 evaluated two polysaccharides extracted from Astragalus membranaceus and Codonopsis pilosella for the adjuvant effect of DC-based cancer vaccines for 4T1 mammary carcinoma in mice. They found this combination could significantly enhance the numbers of CD40, CD80, and CD86 markers in DCs110. And their data also showed it could up-regulate the secretion of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β. More importantly, this combination would not generate the “cytokine storm”, which is an excessive expression of vaccine adjuvant. Lv et al.111 investigated the adjuvant effect of basil polysaccharide on DC vaccines for SKOV3 cells. And the results showed that BPS could significantly inhibit the growth of SKOV3 cells and promote the mature of DCs through modulating the expressions of osteopontin, CD44, and matrix metalloprotein-9 (MMP-9). Therefore, it may be a suitable candidate for DC-based vaccines. Mannose and galactose also are two types of polysaccharides that can induce an immune response, but the mechanism is not clear. Ganoderma polysaccharides, which rich in mannose and galactose, can stimulate the maturation of bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) and enhance the secretion of IFN-γ to produce Teffs. Besides, it also could induce DCs maturation. And Ganoderma polysaccharides-adjuvanted ovalbumin (OVA) immunization promoted the production of specific antibodies and enhanced the OVA-specific T helper type 1 (Th1) cells and cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses, which could both protect mice from OVA-expressing tumor cells. Their data also showed that the immunization of Ganoderma polysaccharides mainly contribute to engaging pattern-recognition receptors families like TLR4112.",
        "TLR4 may be the most important member of the TLR protein for adjuvants of vaccines (Fig. 5C). And it is the only TLR that could activate both MyD88-dependent and -independent (TRIF-dependent) pathways113. As one of the TLR4 agonists, monophosphoryl lipid A is approved as a kind of vaccine adjuvant and has shown immunogenic properties without severe side effects. λ-Carrageenan, which is extracted from marine red algae, could effectively enhance E7-specific immune responses induced by E7-peptide vaccines via TLR4 pathway114, and thus enhance its therapeutic outcomes. In addition, the injection of λ-carrageenan significantly up-regulated the proportion of M1 macrophages and DCs in TME and it also increased the numbers of activated lymphocytes and Th17 cells in mice spleens115. Uncarinic acid C (URC), an active compound from Uncaria hynchophylla, has been demonstrated could activate DCs in a fashion that favors Th1 polarization via the TLR4 pathway, and may be suited for DC-based vaccines116. Rutin, extracted from Hedyotis diffusa Willd, could induce cytokines production of immune cells through the TLR4 signaling pathway and enhance the antitumor effect of peptide-based cancer vaccines in HPV-related tumor models117.",
        "Flavonoid is another type of natural product that reportedly adjuvants potential for cancer vaccines (Fig. 6A). Procyanidin, the biological flavonoid widely distributed in fruit, was evaluated adjuvant effects with B16F10 cancer vaccine for melanoma cancer118. The results showed it could significantly enhance T cell-mediated immune responses and promote the secretion of various molecules like perforin, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. They also showed procyanidin could enhance the production of memory T cells induced by cancer vaccines, and then prolonged the survival rate of model rats. Naringenin, one of the most abundant flavonoids in diets, can improve the efficacy of OVA antitumor therapeutic vaccines by increasing intracellular ROS119. ROS has been reported to enhance MHC-I antigen cross-presentation through either regulation of the pH in the internalization compartments or antigen oxidation for the MHC-I antigen processing120,121. Naringenin-enhanced antigen cross-presentation is dependent on a moderate level of lipid peroxidation that increases antigen leakage from endosomes/lysosomes without impairing DC activation.Figure 6Natural products improve the therapeutic effect of cancer vaccines as adjuvants. (A) Flavonoids; (B) other natural products.Figure 6",
        "Natural products improve the therapeutic effect of cancer vaccines as adjuvants. (A) Flavonoids; (B) other natural products.",
        "Moreover, there are some other types of natural products that have been explored the adjuvants’ potential for cancer vaccines (Fig. 6B). Neem leaf glycoprotein could effectively up-regulate the expression of CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, and MHCs on the surface of DCs and these matured DCs also could induce a high amount secretion of IFN-γ by T cells122. Besides, neem leaf glycoprotein would help to induce specific immune responses of TSAs through the antigen presentation modulated by macrophage123. More importantly, it also could increase the numbers of both central and effector memory CD8+ T cells to generate anti-tumor immunity of cancer vaccines124. Carthamus tinctorius could promote the production of IFN-γ and IL-10 of T cells in the spleen and stimulate DCs maturation through the up-regulation of immunological molecule expressions125. When DC-based vaccines were injected with antigens and C. tinctorius, this combination effectively enhances the numbers of TNF-α and IL-1β and stimulate many immunologic molecules that were mainly expressed on the cell membrane of DCs. In addition, C. tinctorius also could increase Teffs production and enhance the therapeutic outcome of cancer vaccines. Antrodia camphorate, a kind of promising adjuvants of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)/neu DNA vaccines for MBT-2 tumor therapy126, could significantly enhance the Th1-like cellular immune responses and then promoted the production of IFN-γ and HER-2/neu-specific Teffs. Therefore, antrodia camphorate could enhance the antitumor effect of the HER-2/neu DNA vaccine.",
        "As mentioned above, saponins, polysaccharides, and flavonoids are three main categories that showed the potential of being qualified adjuvants for cancer vaccines. And the mechanisms of these three categories are different. Saponins mainly rely on its unique chemical structure to punch pores on cell membranes that allow antigens to access into cells. Polysaccharides mainly depend on its compositions that have the immune-stimulating ability. For flavonoid, its effect on cancer vaccines mainly contributes to the unique regulating effect on immune-associated processes, such as ROS and lipid peroxidation. In addition, the NF-κB and TLR4 signaling pathways are two important pathways that are modulated by natural products to sensitize the efficiencies of cancer vaccines.",
        "Immune-check point is the other important way for tumor cells to inhibit the Teffs’ activities. Seven types of immune-checkpoint antibodies have been applied to clinical anti-tumor therapy. And the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has stood out among ICTs due to the excellent therapeutic outcomes in many studies and clinical trials127. However, the existence of immunosuppressive microenvironments in tumors limits the application of anti-ICTs antibodies. And natural products have been reported to show the ability to regulate the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 and reverse the immunosuppression.",
        "For PD-1 ligand, there are several natural products have been reported to inhibit its expression (Fig. 7A). A kind of triterpenoid saponin isolated from Anemone flaccida inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell growth by blocking the activation of PD-1 and PD-L1 through the downregulation of STAT3 signaling pathways128. And these triterpenoid saponins also could reduce Tregs production and increased the number of splenic immune cells in H22 tumor-bearing mice. Liang et al.129 investigated the pharmacodynamic of Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides (DOPS) in colorectal cancer, which showed it could effectively improve infiltrating CD8+ cytotoxicity T lymphocyte activity through reducing PD-1 expression and enhance tumor immune response. Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide combined with paclitaxel (PTX) could reserve the exhausted state of tumor infiltration lymphocytes (TILs) via down-regulating the expressions of PD-1130. Besides, G. lucidum polysaccharide also sensitized the therapeutic effect of PTX and restored the gut dysbiosis induced by PTX. Delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (D3G) and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), which active metabolites of anthocyanins (ANC), both can inhibit the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in tumor microenvironments of colon cancer cells and induce cancer cell death131.Figure 7Natural products down-regulate the expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1.Figure 7",
        "Natural products down-regulate the expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1.",
        "For PD-L1 ligand, its expression is controlled by several pathways, such as JAK-STAT pathway132 and NF-κB pathway133 (Fig. 7B and C), and several reviews have summarized the functions of these signaling pathways in regulating the expressions of PD-L1 ligand134, 135, 136. Some natural products have been explored the capacity for the down-regulation of PD-L1 through these pathways.",
        "The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is related to the PD-L1 mRNA expression. It has been reported that increasing the activities of JAK and STAT signal transducers will upregulate the expression of PD-L1137, and thus the agents that can inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway have the ability to downregulate the PD-L1 expression. Zhang et al.138 found that berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from Coptidis rhizomes, can reduce the expressions of PD-L1 through the JAK‒STAT signaling pathway and reverse the resistance induced by doxorubicin in the ovarian cancer cell. Silibinin, a type of flavonoid, has been shown to significantly downregulated PD-L1 expression through the JAK‒STAT pathway and increased the immunogenicity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)139. Baicalein and its conjugate baicalin, which are active flavonoids of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, could downregulate the PD-L1 expression through suppressing STAT3 activity and then reactivate T cells sensitivity to kill tumor cells140. A triterpenoid sapogenin monomeric compound extracted from Panax ginseng, panaxadiol reportedly enhanced the activity of CTLs of tumor-cells killing capacity by the suppression of STAT3 activity through JAK1 and JAK2 pathway. And their results also showed panaxadiol downregulated hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which also could affect PD-L1 expression141. Han et al.142 investigated tanshinone in hepatocellular carcinoma showed that it can induce apoptosis through the JAK2‒STAT3 signaling pathway and simultaneously down-regulate the PD-1 expression caused by TNF-γ, thereby enhancing the immunotherapy effect. Apigenin, a bioavailable flavonoid found in nature, has been reported that could inhibit the high-level expression of PD-L1 induced by IFN-γ through inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT1 in breast cancer cells and melanoma cells143,144.",
        "The NF-κB pathway is the other pathway that can effectively modulate the expression of PD-L1. The mutated or hyperactivated NF-κB can significantly promote the PD-L1 expression145. Ginsenoside Rk1, an active compound extracted from ginseng, was reported that could inhibit PD-L1 expression in human lung adenocarcinoma (A549 and PC9) cells through inhibiting the NF-κB pathway146. In addition, inhibiting NF-κB transcription also could directly induce the apoptosis of A549 and PC9 cancer cells. Ginsenoside Rg3, the other active compound from ginseng, was identified that could reduce the expression of PD-L1 induced by cisplatin through inhibiting the activation of NF-κB in A549 cells147. And it also reported that Rg3 could evaluate the proportion of T cells in NSCLC patients148. A novel natural polysaccharide from Cordyceps militaris, CMPB90-1, reportedly restrained the PD-L1-PD-1 axis by downregulating AKT/NF-κB pathway149. And then, it also could reverse the inhibitory effects of TAMs on T cells by regulating the secretion of cytokines from M2 macrophages through this pathway. Moreover, Hsu et al.150 also found that C. militaris could reduce the expression of PD-L1 through modulating the secretions of IFN-γ and TNF-α in oral cancer cells and decrease the secretion of IL-17A. Hesperidin, a flavonoid compound from orange peel, has been reported that could strongly inhibit the mRNA expression and protein activity of PD-L1 through the inhibition of AKT/NF-κB signaling in triple-negative breast cancer151.",
        "Besides the natural products mentioned above, there are still some natural products that have been shown could regulate PD-L1 expressions. Buzhong Yiqi Decoction (BYD) is a kind of compound preparation made from Astragali (Radix Astragali), Codonopsis (Radix Codonopsis Pilosella), Trigonal (Rhizoma Sparganii), and other main drugs. Xu et al.152 found this traditional Chinese decoction could down-regulate the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in gastric cancer cells to promote CTLs activities through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Besides, this downregulation effect is further enhanced after the combination with 5-fluorouracil152. SA-49, an active compound extracted from Sophora alopecuroides L., was found could induce melanogenesis associated transcription factor by activating protein kinase Cα and subsequently suppressing glycogen synthase kinase 3β, accordingly triggered lysosome-based degradation of PD-L1153. Yao et al.154 found that chaenomeles speciose nakai has the anti-tumor activity of down-regulating the expression of PD-L1 in a dose-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and enhancing its immune activity.",
        "Therefore, it can be found that the mechanism of inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 by natural products are mainly attributed to the regulation of the related signaling pathways, which have a common modulated effect of ICTs on almost all kinds of tumors. This mechanism can also remodel the immunosuppression in tumors through these signaling pathways, such as CMPB90-1 reversing the inhibition of TAMs and decreasing the secretion of IL-17A, which is the main difference from that of anti-ICTs antibodies. And this is a unique advantage of natural products in the modulation of ICTs.",
        "Besides the down-regulation of PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions, natural products also showed outstanding therapeutic outcomes of the combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies (Fig. 8).Figure 8Natural products combine with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of these antibodies. (A) Andrographolide improve the efficiency of anti-PD-1 antibodies (CD279, BP0146) by reducing PGE2 secretion; (B)Diosgenin enhance the therapeutic outcomes of anti-PD-1 antibodies (Clone 29F.1A12) by modulating intestinal microbiota; (C) Crytotanshinone improve the efficiency of anti-PD-L1 antibodies (Clone 10F.9G2) through activation of NF-κB pathway; (D) Puerarin improve the efficiency of anti-PD-L1 antibodies through inhibiting the CAFs activities.Figure 8",
        "Natural products combine with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of these antibodies.

        "Andrographolide, a compound extracted from Andrographis paniculata, plays an important role in Chinese traditional medicine for nearly 100 years (Fig. 8A). Liu et al.155 found it combined with anti-PD-1 antibody (CD279, BP0146) reflected better therapeutic outcomes than single-drug treatment for CT26 colon cancer. And this combination could enhance the activities of Teffs, increase IFN-γ secretion, and promote the expressions of FASL, perforin, and granzyme B, which are all Teffs-associated molecules. And the mechanism of this combined therapy is to inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and release of PGE2, which is a key element for keeping the immunosuppression in tumors155.",
        "Diosgenin, a natural steroidal saponin from Acacia concinna, can enhance the activity of anti-PD-1 antibodies by increasing the number of T infiltrated cells156 (Fig. 8B). Dong et al.157 proved that the combination of diosgenin with anti-PD-1 antibody (clone 29F.1A12) could effectively promote necrosis and apoptosis of melanoma cells. And they also found that this combined administration promoted the Teffs infiltration and expression of IFN-γ. Besides, their results showed the mechanism of diosgenin sensitizes the anti-PD-1 antibody mainly contributes to the regulation function of intestinal microbiota. It could increase the number of clostridiales orders, which represents the better sensitivity of anti-PD-1 antibodies therapy.",
        "Cryptotanshinone, an agent purified from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has extremely high medicinal value in China. Liu et al.158 discovered the therapeutic effect of cryptotanshinone at low doses (10 μg/mouse) combined with the anti-PD-L1 antibody (clone 10F.9G2) in LLC-bearing mice (Fig. 8C). The results showed that LLC tumors were cued by this novel combination. And it also reflected the resultant tumor-free mice had resistance to LLC or not B16 melanoma, which illustrated that this combination enhanced the generation of antitumor immune responses and immunological memory of LLC. Besides, they also explore the mechanism of cryptotanshinone-induced DC maturation. Cryptotanshinone could effectively downregulate I-κBα expression and upregulate phosphorylated P65 in DCs, which activate NF-κB pathway and promote the secretion of cytokine genes including TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-12159,160. In addition, cryptotanshinone also enhanced phosphorylated p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) of DCs that could upregulate the expression of surface costimulatory and MHC molecules159,161.",
        "The cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is also an important factor that induces the immunosuppression in tumors162. Puerarin, a flavonoid extracted from the kudzu root, is widely used in China as the anti-fibrosis agent in multiple organs, such as the lung, heart, and liver. Xu et al.162 reported that puerarin could sensitize anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy through regulating the ROS level to decrease the number of CAFs (Fig. 8D). ROS is an important factor that can induce immunosuppression and enhance the CAFs proliferation163, 164, 165. Xu et al.162 found that puerarin could significantly inhibits ROS production, which results in the reversing of immunosuppression. The low ROS level also decreases the number of CAFs and this can remove the physical barrier in the 4T1 tumor model, which increases the infiltration of T cells by 2-fold compare to the control group. And the high level of infiltrated T cells enhances the therapeutic outcomes of anti-PD-L1 antibodies.",
        "Although there is no clear conclusion about how to efficiently enhance the therapeutic outcomes of anti-ICTs antibodies, reversing immunosuppression and increasing tumor-infiltrated T cells' number are two important points that have been commonly accepted. As mention above, the inhibition of COX2 and PGE2 induced by andrographolide and activation of NF-κB in immune cells induced by cryptotanshinone both reverse the immunosuppression in tumor and finally improve the anti-ICTs therapy. In addition, the gut microbiome is also an important factor that modulates responses to anti-PD-L1 therapy166. And its mechanism also focuses on the modulation of immunosuppression and enhancement of Teffs’ function, and thus the regulation function of intestinal microbiota induced by diosgenin enhances the outcome of anti-PD-L1 therapy. For increasing the infiltrated T cells in tumors, Xu et al.162 found that puerarin could achieve it through downregulation of CAFs, which open the physical barrier of these T cells. In addition, the low ROS level induced by puerarin also reversing the immunosuppression in the tumor. Therefore, natural products have their unique advantages in the combination of anti-ICTs therapy.",
        "Adoptive cell immunotherapy, especially T-cell-based adoptive immunotherapy, is a promising anti-cancer immunotherapy and has shown excellent therapeutic outcomes in the patients (Fig. 9A)167. Briefly, the process of this immunotherapy consists of three steps: 1) tumor fragments extracted from patient are cultured in vitro under the exaction of IL-2; 2) lymphocytes are overgrown under this condition and tumor cells will be killed after 2–3 weeks; 3) the pure lymphocytes are expanded to about 1011 cells and then adoptive back into patients. Therefore, the number and activity of the target lymphocytes cultured in vitro is the key point for adoptive cell immunotherapy. However, this approach remains challenging due to a series of reasons, including the restriction of antitumor effect by immunosuppressive mechanism, the insufficient anti-tumor effect of T-cells cultured in vitro, and expensive therapeutic cost. As the in-depth investigation of the immune-mediated function of natural products, these obstacles reportedly could be conquered by some natural agents.Figure 9Natural products enhance the therapeutic effect of adoptive cell transfer therapy.

        "First of all, natural products can efficiently expand the target lymphocytes in vitro and it also can keep the activities of these cells. Ma et al.168 reported the therapeutic effect of H. diffusa polysaccharides (HDP) on the adoptive treatment of cytokine-induced killer cells (CIKs), which is a kind of safety and feasibility adoptive cells therapy in anti-tumor treatment (Fig. 9B). Their results showed that HDP could up-regulate the percentage of CD3+ and CD56+ CIK cells. And it also had great anti-tumor ability due to the promotion of IFN-γ and TNF-α productions. Besides, there is a lower ratio of apoptosis in CIK cells treated by HDP. Ju et al.169 proved that 6-gingerol, the major active compound of ginger (Zingiber officinale), could effectively enhance the Teffs production in tumors (Fig. 9C). After the treatment with 3.0 μg/mL of 6-gingerol, they found it could effectively inhibit tumor growth due to the increased number of Teffs. Then, they inject CD8+ T cells, which were purified from the 6-gingerol pretreated tumor-bearing mice, into EG7 tumor-bearing mice. And they found more CD8+ T-cells infiltrated in tumors and more cells undergoing division in the 6-gingerol-treated group compared to the control group. Moreover, they treated CD8 T cells with 6-gingerol in vitro and transferred them into EGE7 tumor-bearing RAG2−/− mice. And these 6-gingerol-treated CD8 T-cells also showed outstanding anti-tumor activity. These results showed the great potential of natural products in adoptive cell therapy for cell expansion in vitro and this may reduce the cost of this immunotherapy.",
        "Then, natural products also can enhance the therapeutic outcomes of adoptive cell therapy by improving the Teffs’ activities, enhancing the infiltration of lymphocytes, and remodeling tumor immunosuppressive microenvironments. Alatrash et al.170 reported fucosylation could enhance the homing of antigen-specific CTLs to malignant niches and increase its anti-tumor activity (Fig. 9D). Besides, fucosylation would not increase the homing of CTL in normal tissues. Their results showed fucosylation could alter CTL trafficking, cytolytic machinery, synapse formation, and expression of distinct activating surface molecules. And their method could effectively enhance the therapeutic effect of T-cells-based adoptive immunotherapy. Banerjee et al.171 found that neem leaf glycoprotein (NLGP) could significantly restrict the growth of melanoma through vascular normalization by regulating cell-mediated immunity to enhance the infiltration of immune cells (Fig. 9E). Their results showed the adoptive splenic immune cells therapy treated by NLGP could effectively normalize the angiogenesis, which is mainly induced by tumor-associated microenvironments. Besides, they also analyzed the expression of VEGF, VEGFR2, and CD31 in adoptive transfer immune cells pretreated by NLGP and their expressions all were down-regulated. Thus, NLGP may be suitable sensitize for adoptive immune cells therapy. In addition, Chang et al.172 investigated that curcumin could enhance adoptive T cells therapy through reversing the immunosuppression in tumors (Fig. 9F). They found that the curcumin could enhance the activity of Teffs, which could alter the tumor immunosuppression environment. And curcumin could increase the accumulation and function of T-cells by blocking various immunosuppressive factors and cells, including TGF-β, indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and Tregs. In addition, the treatment of curcumin also would affect granzyme B promoter-conjugated optical reporter to improve the cytotoxicity of Teffs. And these results suggested that adoptive therapy with curcumin, a kind of multitargeting drug, has the potential for clinical application.",
        "As mention above, natural products not only can expand the target immune cells in vitro, but also enhance the therapeutic effects of this immunotherapy, which shows great potential in adoptive immune-cells therapy.",
        "After so many advantages have been explored in natural products in cancer immunotherapies, the shortages of natural products were also been emphasized in these studies and limited its further application, including low solubility, low bioavailability, and low tumor targeting. Because of these limitations, most the natural products have to apply to patients with a huge dosage, which may increase the risk of inducing side effects. Therefore, advanced drug-delivery systems should be designed for natural products to overcome these limitations. And the nano-drug delivery system, such as liposomes, micelles, and nano-particles, stands out due to the better outcomes of tumor-targeting, anti-tumor activities, immune-sensitization, stability, and safety.",
        "Xiao et al.173 reported a novel nanoparticle-linked anti-PD-1 antibodies on its surface and encapsulating curcumin. And this kind of nanoparticle was designed with dual pH sensitivity (Fig. 10A). Compare to curcumin solution, this kind of nanoparticles enhances the cellular uptake of curcumin. Besides the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) effect, the decoration of anti-PD-1 antibodies will also help nanoparticles binding to PD-1+ T cells. Owing to the pH sensitivity, these nanoparticles showed higher targeting for tumor cells. Then, more curcumin was delivered into the tumor area to inhibit the NF-κB pathway, which significantly inhibits the production of CCL-22, TGF-β, and IL-10. And it will decrease the number of Treg cells and enhance the activities of Teffs. This nanoparticle effectively co-delivery anti-PD-1 antibodies and curcumin into tumors and showed excellent therapeutic outcomes in vivo and in vitro.Figure 10Nano-drug delivery system design for natural products.

        "Zhang et al.79 designed a novel nanoparticle encapsulating quercetin (Q) and alantolactone (A), which promoted antitumor responses through the ICD effect for microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (Fig. 10B). They found the synergistic effect of quercetin and alantolactone at ICD effect and the anti-tumor activities were maximized at the molar ratio of 1:4. To deliver this effective molar ratio into the target area, they developed a new micelle encapsulated with Q and A, which was prepared with DSPE-PEG2000 and d-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) through the ethanol injection method. And they also found the drug release ratio of these Q-A micelles was also approximately 1:4, which is the optimal molar ratio. After various treatments of these Q-A micelles, a dramatic increase of CRT+ cells induced by the ICD effect and a significant decrease of Tregs and MDSCs also were reported. Moreover, the tumor-promoting inflammation was also inhibited by the G-M micelles treatment.",
        "Yu et al.174 developed a kind of gold nanoparticle (Au-NP) containing Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide (GLP) to overcome the drawbacks of GLP solutions, such as the short half-life, instability, and low tumor targeting (Fig. 10C). And the results also showed the good characteristics of the GLP-AuNP including increased instability, enhanced tumor targeting, and long-circulating time. Meanwhile, these GLP-AuNPs also kept the immunomodulated function of GLP like inducing dendritic cell (DC) activation and promoting the production of Teffs in the spleen. Besides, GLP-AuNPs exhibited strong inhibitory effects on 4T1 tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis when combined with doxorubicin. This work suggests that polysaccharides from natural herbs can be incorporated into nanocomposites with immunoregulatory characteristics for enhanced efficacy in tumor therapy.",
        "Gu et al.175 successfully encapsulated the immunopotentiator Angelica Sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) and OVA into poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid, PLGA) to formulate the novel NPs-based vaccine delivery system (Fig. 10D). This kind of NPs showed good stability at 4 °C. And the OVA in the core of NPs could effectively release at 37 °C. Besides, these NPs also could enhance the cellular immune response through improve the activity and proliferation of Teffs. Furthermore, a strong specific antibody response induced by OVA and ASP is observed in this study. All of these results proved that the NPs vaccine delivery system could induce longer immune responses compared to the traditional vaccine preparations.",
        "The Liposome is another vesicle to deliver antigen protein into the target area. Zhang et al.99 developed a liposome delivery system of A. saponins and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) antigen to maximize the anti-tumor immune responses induced by these antigens. Through the adjuvant function of A. saponins and bFGF antigen protein, this liposome delivery system could induce lots of specific antibodies and enhance the production of IFN-γ in BALB/c mice. They also found this system could effectively inhibit the angiogenesis in TME, which is an additional anti-tumor function of this novel-designed liposome.",
        "Lu et al.104 reported a kind of curcumin micelles that can remodel the suppressive immune microenvironment to improve the activity of a lipid-based the TRP2 peptide vaccine (Fig. 10E). The combination of curcumin-polyethylene glycol conjugate (CUR-PEG) micelles and TRP2 peptide vaccine showed an outstanding therapeutic effect compared to individual treatments. Moreover, it significantly boosted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses and IFN-γ secretion. Besides, this combination therapy also inhibited the production of immunosuppressive factors (such as IL-6 and chemokine ligand 2) and enhanced the number of proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α and IFN-γ). A phenotype switch of M2 to M1 of this kind of micelles has also been reported in this study. These results all showed the great potential of CUR-PEG micelle as a novel adjuvant for peptide cancer vaccines.",
        "Above all, there are some unique advantages of nano-drug delivery systems about improving the therapeutic effect of natural products. First of all, it can efficiently keep the activities and sensitized effect of cancer therapy and increase the circulation time of natural products. Then, it also enhances the tumor-targeting through the modification of some tumor-specific species and decreases the dosage of natural products. Thirdly, the nano-sized particles of natural products reported by previous studies also showed good stability and safety. Therefore, the nano-drug delivery system is an ideal strategy for natural products.",
        "After concluding and investigating the previous studies about natural products sensitizing cancer immunotherapy, we find that natural products can effectively enhance the therapeutic effects of all these immunotherapies, including cancer vaccines, immune-check points inhibitors antibodies, and adoptive cells immunotherapy. In addition, natural products successfully expand the indications of immunotherapy into “cold tumor”, such as triple-negative breast tumor, Lewis lung tumor, colorectal tumor model, and so on.",
        "As the review is shown, natural products can enhance the specific cancer immunotherapy through modification of the corresponding mechanisms, such as the induction of ICD effect for cancer vaccines, the increase of infiltrated T cells for anti-ICDs antibodies, and the expansion of the target immune cells in vitro for adoptive immune-cells transfer therapy. More importantly, as for the immunosuppressive factors and cells in tumors, which is also the key element for passivating all kinds of cancer immunotherapies, natural products also have shown outstanding effects on it, such as inhibition of secretion of immunosuppressive factors (TGF-β, PGE2, IL-10 and so on), promotion of secretion of anti-tumor immune factors (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β and so on), downregulation of the number of immunosuppressive cells (Tregs, MDSCs, M1 macrophage cells, and so on) and enhancement of the activities and number of Teffs. All of these effects of natural products can contribute to the reversion of tumor-associated immunosuppressive microenvironment.",
        "According to Table 2, saponins, polysaccharides, and flavonoids are three main categories that can improve immunotherapy. Some of them even could sensitize two or more kinds of immunotherapy, such as ginsenoside Rg3, ganoderma polysaccharides, and curcumin. And the mechanism mainly depends on the regulation of associated signaling pathways. Some pathways even can improve the therapeutic effects of different immunotherapies, such as the NF-κB pathway for cancer vaccines and anti-PD-L1 antibodies. The reason for that mainly contributes to the connection between these pathways and immunosuppression with tumors. As mentioned in part 1, tumor cells can “hijack” (upregulate or downregulate) some signaling pathways, which associate with the immune system, to induce immunosuppression. Therefore, the agents that can regulate these pathways to a normal level will reverse the immunosuppression and sensitize cancer immunotherapy. Natural products are such agents. And this is also their biggest advantage compared to other agents. According to this unique mechanism, as mentioned above, some natural products even can sensitize two or more kinds of cancer immunotherapies.Table 2List of natural products that improve cancer immunotherapy, including cancer vaccines, immune-check points inhibitors and adoptive cell transfer therapy.Table 2CategorySourceNatural productKey points of sensitizing immunotherapyRef.SaponinsGinsengGinsenoside Rg3•Trigger “ICD” effect•Down-regulate the expression of PD-L174,141,142Ginsenoside Rg1•Enhance the anti-cancer effect of cancer DC-based vaccines through NF-κB pathway97Ginsenoside Rk1•Down-regulate the expression of PD-L1 through NF-κB pathway140AstragalusAstragalus saponins•Enhance the anti-cancer effect of cancer protein-based vaccines96Quillaja saponaria MolinaQS-21•Enhance the anti-cancer effect of cancer vaccines165Crocus sativus cormeCS5•Enhance the anti-cancer effect of cancer protein-based vaccines95Anemone flaccidaAnemone flaccida saponins•Down-regulate the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 through STAT3 pathway125Panax ginsengSapogenin•Down-regulate the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 through STAT3 pathway136Acacia concinnaDiosgenin•Enhance the anti-cancer effect of anti-PD-1 antibody (CD279, BP0146)151PolysaccharidesDioscoreaDioscrorea polysaccharides•Enhance the anti-cancer effect of cancer DNA vaccines104Astragalus membranaceusAstragalus polysaccharides•Enhance the anti-cancer effect of cancer DC-based vaccines with Codonopsis polysaccharide106Codonopsis pilosulaeCodonopsis polysaccharides•Enhance the anti-cancer effect of cancer DC-based vaccines with Astragalus polysaccharide106BasilBasil polysaccharides•Enhance the anti-cancer effect of cancer DC-based vaccines108GanodemaGanodema polysaccharides•Enhance the anti-cancer effect of cancer vaccines•Down-regulate the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 through STAT3 pathway109Dendrobium officinaleDendrobium officinale polysaccharides•Down-regulate the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 through STAT3 pathway126Cordyceps militarisCMPB90-1•Down-regulate the expression of PD-L1 through NF-κB pathway143Hedyotis diffusaHedyotis diffusa polysaccharides•Enhance the anti-cancer effect of adoptive CIK cells immunotherapy157FlavonoidsOnionQuercetin•Trigger “ICD” effect (with alantolactone at 1:4 ratio)76H.

        "Besides the significant sensitized effect of natural products into immunotherapy, there are many advantages of application natural products as sensitizers compared to the investigation of new agents. Firstly, most of them mentioned in this review have been approved by the FDA, the cost of increasing indications to them is much lower than developing whole new agents. Then, most the natural products have wide treatment windows and high security. More important, natural products still have other functions like anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and anti-cancer properties. And these functions could further help the anti-tumor treatments.",
        "Moreover, there are several studies that investigated how to use nanotechnology to overcome the shortages of natural products, such as low solubility, low bioavailability, and low tumor targeting. And these new nanoparticles of natural products not only showed higher tumor targeting and long-term circulation, but also further enhance the anti-tumor effect of immunotherapy. Nano-technology promotes natural products to be the better sensitizer of cancer immunotherapy.",
        "However, there are still some problems that should be solved to make natural products apply to cancer immunotherapy better. First of all, as for so many natural products combined with cancer immunotherapies, it should be screened for the most suitable one based on the specific cancer immunotherapy. For example, for peptide vaccines or mRNA vaccines with poor immune-stimulate effects, the suitable natural products should have the ability to improve this aspect, such as enhancing the antigen-presenting process, but for anti-ICTs therapy, the effect of increasing T infiltrated cells’ number is the most important character for the suitable natural products. Secondly, the signaling pathways related to the immune system and cancer immunotherapy should be explored more deeply and comprehensively. It can be found that the sensitization of natural products on cancer immunotherapy mainly depends on the specific signaling pathways associated with the immune system, and thus a comprehensive understanding of these signaling pathways will be a beneficial to selecting the more effective natural products. Thirdly, there should be more data to provide information about the function of natural products in cancer immunotherapy. Although various natural products that can sensitize cancer immunotherapy have been discussed in this review and some of them even have been applied into clinical trials, the data of this field is still too little compare to that of natural products used in chemotherapy and radiotherapy.",
        "Above all, this review collects and concludes the emerging studies about natural products sensitizing cancer immunotherapies. And there is a clear conclusion that natural products have positive effects on cancer immunotherapies, which mainly depends on their unique modification of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The emerging role of natural products in cancer immunotherapy still has more possible and is worthy to be paid more attention.",

        "In 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the first approvals of two CAR-T therapies for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapies, including DLBCL not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, and for patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse [1,2].",
        "The registration studies enrolled patients who were previously treated and considered of poor prognosis, with some having had prior stem cell transplantation. Yet, the results that were obtained from the studies (albeit single-arm studies) were quite encouraging and resulted in high responses in those difficult-to-treat patient populations [3]. The genetically engineered T cells, which are injected into the patient’s body, result in engraftment and rapid proliferation. Subsequently, each CAR-T cell attacks many cancer cells. This unique mechanism of action, with the involvement of the patient’s own immune system, resulted in a very high response rate despite the late disease stages and poor prognoses [4,5]. Furthermore, CAR-T therapy was used to bridge other therapeutic strategies with further improvement of responses. With the high response rates and durable responses with long-term follow-up [6], it was hoped that the responses would be for long durations with the possibility of a cure for these patients. Unfortunately, the relapse rate was around 30–60% for patients treated with CAR-T therapy [7]. With limited treatment options for patients who relapse after CAR-T therapy, it is of paramount importance to understand the mechanism of resistance in those patients in order to develop a subsequent effective therapy.",
        "Patients who relapsed following CAR-T therapy fall into two main groups of relapse: CD19-positive cells or CD19-negative cells [6]. The CD19-positive cells relapse occurs when the response to CAR-T therapy is not sufficient, with minimal effect for CAR-T cells and only transient B-cell aplasia. With flow cytometry, CD19 can be detected on the surface of the cells. Different animal studies attempted to identify the cause of this weak response to CAR-T therapy. Some of the factors that were proposed are the quality of CAR-T cells synthesised from children and young adults compared to those from older adults. For younger patients, the quality of the CAR-T cells was better, which was reflected in the tendency to receive better responses (longer event-free survival times) in the younger age groups versus older age groups. Studies have shown that the starting T-cell phenotype of CAR-T cell manufacturing is crucial to patients’ prognosis. A study conducted by Gardner et al. enrolled 43 children and young adults [7]. They looked for factors that contributed to a maintained response among those who responded, achieved, and maintained a minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative state beyond 63 days, versus the non-responders who did not achieve that [7,8]. The analysis of apheresis obtained from both groups showed that in non-responders, the percentage of CD8+ T cells, which expressed lymphocyte-activated gene-3 (LAG-3) and PD-1, had significantly increased, whereas in the responders group, the number of CD4+ CAR cells and CD8+ CAR cells was significantly higher at the time of peak implantation. They also found that the number of CD8+ T cells expressing tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was much less in the non-responder group compared to the responder group. This led to the assumption that the increase in LAG-3-expressing cells (LAG-3+ T cells) and decrease in the cytokines after stimulation leads to the production of ineffective CAR-T cells, or ones with low potency resulting in a CD19-positive relapse. This is in comparison to the responders who have less LAG-3-expressing cells and an increase in cytokines after stimulation, thus having a better response [9]. The presence of LAG-3+ T cells is a biomarker for T-cell exhaustion. T-cell exhaustion refers to a state where the T cells produced are dysfunctional with the decrease in the effectors and increase in the expression of the inhibitory receptors. This phenomenon is induced by chronic stimulation in patients with cancer. Chronic stimulation leads to the production of T cells that are usually deficient in their intrinsic activity. Accordingly, CAR-T cells derived from patients with cancer will be defective in function, which can lead to poor prognosis and relapse. The mechanism of CAR-T cell exhaustion is still not clearly understood. It was suggested that the CARs on the CAR-T cells could form a cluster that is formed independently of the antigen stimulation, which leads to the development of tonic CAR-CD3ζ signalling that can cause CAR-T cell exhaustion. Additionally, the endogenous T-cell receptor signal of CAR-T cells caused by a specific antigen stimulation can result in T-cell exhaustion [6,9].",
        "The CD19-negative relapses represent up to 20% of the relapsed CAR-T cell treated patients. With CD19-negative relapse, CD19 is not detected on the surface of the cells. This occurs due to mutation in exons 1–13 of the CD19 gene [10]. Exons 1–4 carry the codes for the extracellular domains, and exons 5–13 carry those of the transmembrane domain. Studies have shown that patients who show CD19-negative relapse have developed mutations in exons 2–5 in the form of one insertion or deletion [11]. The percentage of CD19-negative cells can be measured by flow cytometry, which is also able to assess the frequency of allelic mutations and the percentage of cells where there is a homozygous loss and biallelic mutations, which are major reasons for the loss of the targeted epitope in the membrane of CD19, with the subsequent escape from the effect of anti-CD19 CAR-T. Called antigen escape, this leads to the development of resistance to CD19-directed CAR-T therapies.",
        "There are other mechanisms that were described as possible causes for the occurrence of CD19 gene mutation and antigen escape, such as alternative splicing with the subsequent development of CD19-negative resistance [12]. These resistance mechanisms are not unique to CAR-T therapy. They have been observed in other tumour types, e.g., breast cancer tissues show splicing of exon 16 of HER2 leading to resistance to trastuzumab. Likewise, melanoma tissues show splicing of BRAF (V600E), which results in dimerisation and consequently resistance to vemurafenib. Splicing of mRNA (e.g., in SF3B1, SRSF2) also occurred in haematological tumours such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) resulting in resistance to treatment [13].",
        "Both approved CAR-T cells cause the condition called cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which includes a set of life-threatening or even fatal reactions to the infusion of CAR-T therapy. Generally, CAR-T therapy should not be administered to patients who have active infections or inflammatory disorders.",
        "Treatment with CAR-T cells causes rapid activation of T cells and the release of high levels of cytokines. The main cytokines involved in CRS are IL-6, IL-10, and interferon (IFN)-Υ. IFN-Υ, when secreted, causes the release of other cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Its release is also accompanied by fever, chills, headache, malaise, and other symptoms occurring with CRS. IL-6 also is considered a key cytokine in the pathophysiology of CRS since it is highly elevated in cases suffering from CRS. It is also responsible for the occurrence of many of the severe symptoms such as vascular leakage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The occurrence of life-threatening CRS mandates immediate treatment with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids. [1,2,14]. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antagonist, is the standard for CRS management, although the optimal timing of administration is still unclear [14,15] (Figure 1). Management is also depending on the severity of the symptoms. The commonly used scheme for the assessment of the severity of CRS is the one developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).",
        "CRS can affect different body systems and organs. Other medical specialties such as neurology, nephrology, cardiology in addition to the treating haematologist are required for the effective management of patients with severe CRS. Intensive care facilities should also be available when needed. The early and appropriate management of severe cases of CRS generally can lead to a positive outcome [15].",
        "CRS can affect different organs, and the symptoms can range from mild to severe and debilitating [16]. Respiratory symptoms that are common with CRS can range from cough and hypoxia to acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can be seen on lung images as opacities affecting large areas of the lung and can be bilateral [16,17,18].",
        "Cardiac and circulatory manifestations can be in the form of hypotension and can progress to capillary leak syndrome with subsequent peripheral and pulmonary edemas and signs of cardiac failure [19].",
        "Neurotoxicity is also a serious type of toxicity that can occur following treatment with CAR-T therapy [20]. It can be in the form of mild confusion symptoms and headaches to a severe form of hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, and even seizures [21]. As a result of the relatively common incidence of neurotoxicity and the seriousness of it, the term CAR-T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) is now used [22]. Despite the common incidence of CRES (being the second most common toxicity associated with CAR-T therapy) and the severity of the symptoms, neither the exact pathophysiology [23] nor the best way to treat it is clear; thus, the management of it may need to be carried out in specialised care units [24,25] (Figure 2).",
        "Investigators have attempted to decrease the CRS signs/symptoms of CAR-T therapy while maintaining its positive therapeutic effect. Frey et al. conducted a study on 35 adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) ALL who received CAR-T therapy [26]. Patients were enrolled in 1 of 3 dosing cohorts. The first cohort was a low-dose cohort where nine patients received a low dose of therapy either as a single dose or fractionated dose. In the second cohort, six patients received CAR-T therapy as a high single dose, and the third cohort had 20 patients enrolled and received high dose therapy either as a single dose or fractionated dose. Any fractionated dose was given on 3 consecutive days with 10%, 30%, and 60% given on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This schedule allowed for the assessment of CRS occurrence, taking necessary measures if they occur, and trying to avoid fatal complications.",
        "The nine patients in the low single or fractionated dose had a complete remission (CR) rate of 33% with manageable toxicity. In the six patients who received the high single dose, three had fatal CRS complications, and the other three achieved CR. The results in the third cohort, where patients received a fractionated high CAR-T dose, were impressive with a CR rate of 90%, an event-free survival rate (EFS) of 49.5% (95% CI: 21–73%), and a 2-year overall survival (OS) rate of 73% (95% CI: 46–88%). Superior results were achieved for the patients who were dosed with a high fractionated dose of CAR-T cells, whereas the toxicity was manageable with only one patient out of the 20 patients having CRS grade 4 and no grade 5 CRS. The fractionation of CAR-T over 3 days allowed for early detection of clinical symptoms of CRS and withholding of consequent doses. Accordingly, in the third cohort, 7 out of the 20 patients received all three doses, nine patients received only one dose, and four patients received two doses. Only two patients in this cohort did not achieve CRS, and both only received two doses. The authors concluded that CAR-T cell fractionation allowed for early dose modification and consequently optimising the safety of patients with R/R ALL who received CAR-T therapy without compromising the efficacy of treatment [26].",
        "Gardner et al. tested the early intervention of tocilizumab plus or minus corticosteroids with the first occurrence of mild CRS symptoms in a study of 43 patients. The first 23 patients received tocilizumab with or without corticosteroids if there was an occurrence of any grade 4 toxicity not meeting the study’s defined dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and lasting >48 h, or there was a DLT lasting >48 h, and in either situation, the CRS was not effectively managed by medication. Corticosteroids were also given to any non-haematologic toxicity >grade 3 that was considered a result of CAR-T infusion, lasting for >48 h, and not controlled despite active medical intervention. The subsequent 20 patients received concomitant tocilizumab and corticosteroids every 6–12 h for persistent mild CRS symptoms according to the requirement of a protocol modification. The investigators reported that despite the patients being treated with tocilizumab and steroids, there was no increase in the incidence of infection. Likewise, the efficacy was not affected by the early treatment with tocilizumab and steroids or the expansion and engraftment of T cells. They also reported a decrease in severe CRS in the 20 patients who had early intervention and concomitant tocilizumab and corticosteroids, versus the first 23 patients who had their CRS managed as above (15% vs. 20%) [27].",
        "In conclusion, the therapeutic effect of CAR-T therapy is well established and has been proven in a wealth of studies; however, the fact that there is a high percentage of patients suffering from relapse and CRS presents serious complications for treatment with CAR-T therapy. It represents huge challenges for the treating physicians and the patients. Ongoing research activity is trying to address the mechanism of relapse and the best way to administer CAR-T therapy in order to reduce the incidence of CRS [28,29].",
        "The unique mechanism of CAR-T therapy in addition to the high positive results mentioned above also triggered wide development programmes assessing this novel therapy in different haematologic malignancies as well as solid tumours.",
        "In 2020, the American Cancer Society estimated AML to represent 1% of all cancers. It is mainly a disease of the older population, being uncommon before the age of 45, with the average age at first presentation of 58 years. Its incidence is slightly more common among men than women. It is the most common leukaemia in adults and the second most common leukaemia in children [30,31].",
        "Currently, with the standard 7 + 3 regimen (consisting of cytarabine for 7 days and anthracycline for 3 days), a CR rate of up to 80% has been achieved in young adults and up to 60% in older adults who are 60 years of age and above. This is followed by post-remission induction, which differs according to different factors, e.g., patient’s age, general condition, molecular prognostic stratification, etc. [32,33]. However, patients who do not achieve remission from the first-line regimens and those who relapse pose a serious problem for the haematologists with the continuous need for the development of effective therapies [34].",
        "In ALL, the presence of a specific target such as CD19 supported the scientific concept behind the development of a specific targeted CAR-T therapy. However, the lack of a specific cell target for AML makes it difficult to treat this disease with targeted immunotherapy [35,36]. Currently, different researchers are attempting to identify an antigen or a group of antigens that are predominantly expressed on the myeloblast and not the normal tissues. This concept of specifically targeting surface antigens on myeloblasts is important to be able to target AML disease while avoiding the exposure of normal tissues to unnecessary immunotherapy, which could result in toxicity [37].",
        "The concept of using targeted immunotherapy for patients with AML was successfully applied by treating CD33-positive AML patients (adults and children over 2 years of age) with chemotherapy and the CD33-targeted antibody-drug conjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin [38,39]. The positive results of this combination led to the approval of this combination in adults and children over 2 years of age who suffer from CD33-positive AML [40,41].",
        "In an attempt to identify the ideal candidates for CAR-T therapy in AML, Perna et al. conducted an extensive analysis of large datasets of transcriptomics and proteomics from malignant and normal tissues [42] (Figure 3). The researchers performed surface-specific proteomic studies in a diverse panel of AML cell lines (THP1, Mono-mac, Kasumi, Molm13, OCI/AML3, and TF-1). The team performed a mass spectrometric analysis, which led to the identification of 4942 proteins. They enriched their protein sets by adding the findings from other similar studies conducted on other AML cell lines (e.g., NB4, HL60, THP1, PLB985, CD32, CD33, CE 96, CD99, and K562). The researchers used data from the Human Protein Atlas, the Human Proteome Map, and the Proteomics Database to identify the protein expression information in different normal tissues/organs such as liver, gallbladder, pancreas, stomach, gut, rectum, testis, epididymis, prostate, breast, etc. [43,44,45]. Consequently, they looked for CAR-T therapy targets that are overexpressed in AML versus normal tissue, and they were able to identify 24 molecules that fulfil this criterion (Figure 3A,B). Using flow cytometry to analyse the expression of the 24 candidates in AML specimens, they managed to detect nine targets that are detected in >75% of the cells (expression range: 78–99%, mean 82%): CD82, TNFRSF1B (also known as CD120b), ADGRE2 (also known as EMR2 or CD312), ITGB5, CCR1 (also known as CD191), CD96, PTPRJ (also known as CD148), CD70, and LILRB2 (also known as CD85d). Six of the nine targets were expressed in <5% in normal tissues (with ADGRE2, CCR1, CD70, and LILRB2 expressed in <5% in freshly purified and activated T cells from healthy donors), whereas the other three were expressed in the normal tissues at a slightly higher level with the maximum expression of 20% (Figure 3C,D). Still, all were much less expressed than their corresponding expression in the primary AML cells. (Figure 3E) [42].",
        "Many pre-clinical studies were also conducted to assess the different possible targets for CAR-T therapy in AML populations, which led to the start of the Phase I clinical studies. These studies tested a wide range of ages, from as young as 6 months to up to 90 years of age. The number of patients treated in these studies was small. Cummins et al. treated six patients with CAR-T therapy. Two patients achieved complete remission (CR), three patients achieved partial remission (PR), and one patient had progressive diseases (PD) [46]. Richie et al. also treated four patients with CAR-T, with all of them initially achieving PR or stable disease (SD), then they relapsed [47]. Of note, both Cummins et al. and Richie et al. used autologous T-cell sources. Numerous studies are ongoing, with data still to be presented [48,49].",
        "In order to assess if CAR-T therapy can target CLL cells, a group of researchers from the NCI in Bethesda managed to construct two CARs. They subsequently chose the one that has shown the best anti-tumour activity in vitro for further testing in CLL clinical trials [50].",
        "One of the earliest observations of clinical activity in CLL was reported by Porter et al. in 2011 [51]. A patient who had R/R CLL was infused with a low dose (approximately 1.5 × 105 cells per kilogram) of autologous CAR-T cells. A real-time polymerase chain reaction detected DNA encoding anti-CD19 CAR-T after 1 day of the infusion of the cells. The infused CAR-T cells expanded to a level more than 1000 times the initial engraftment. The patient achieved CR. The toxicity profile was as expected, with the only grade 3/4 adverse event related to CAR-T therapy being lymphopenia as well as hypogammaglobulinemia, which was a chronic effect. The patient also suffered from tumour lysis syndrome. Leukaemia, as well as normal B cells-expression CD19, disappeared from the patient’s blood and bone marrow cells. A high level of CAR-T cells was maintained in the patient’s blood and bone marrow for 6 months, and the patient’s remission was ongoing at 10 months post-engraftment [52].",
        "Following that, CAR-T therapy was investigated in different clinical trials, with more than 130 patients being tested in the trials. Most of these patients were heavily pre-treated, some relapsed post haematopoietic cell transplant [53,54]. Others were cases treated as they progressed to Richter syndrome. Despite the heterogeneity of the patient population and the adverse prognostic factors, a CR rate in the range of 20–30% of the patients with estimated progression-free survival (PFS) at 18 months of 25% was achieved. These studies have shown the potential activity of CAR-T therapy in the CLL patient population [55,56].",
        "Ibrutinib, which is a breakthrough treatment for patients with CLL, was found to improve response in clinical trials. In one of the trials, treatment with CAR-T therapy following ibrutinib in three patients resulted in responses in all three patients, with one achieving CR [57]. Two other studies combining ibrutinib and CAR-T therapy have shown very promising response rates of 80% in two series of 19 patients with an MRD eradication in the bone marrow of around 90% among responders. The safety profile was not different from that of other patients with other indications when treated with CAR-T therapy, with the CRS being the main concern [58,59]. Other studies are ongoing to explore the full potential of CAR-T therapy in patients with CLL [60].",
        "Data from two studies testing CAR-T therapy targeting the CD30 antigen in patients with HL were recently presented in the Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Meetings of American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) and Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) and highlight the potential role of anti-CD30 CAR-T cells for this disease [61,62]. In one of the trials, the investigators treated the patients with a lymphodepletion chemotherapy that included cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (FC) before CAR-T cell infusion. With 14 patients enrolled in this Phase I study, the median age was 30 years (range: 17–69 years). Patients were CD30 positive HL and heavily pre-treated with a median of five prior regimens. Most patients previously received a checkpoint inhibitor and the monoclonal antibody brentuximab targeting CD30. Patients received a single infusion of one of three dose levels: 2 × 107 cells/m2, 1 × 108 cells/m2, or 2 × 108 cells/m2. The investigators found the expansion and persistence of the CAR-T cells to be dose-dependent. Of the 14 patients treated, important safety findings were seen in four patients who developed grade 1 CRS, and some patients developed maculopapular rashes that disappeared without any treatment. Other adverse events were in the form of alopecia, gastrointestinal toxicities, and transient cytopenias. At 6 weeks, 12 patients were evaluable for response, seven patients achieved CR, and one patient achieved PR. One of the CR patients showed the response by 6 weeks and maintained the remission for more than a year [61].",
        "In another Phase I/II study, patients received one of two dose levels in a standard 3 + 3 design. The doses tested in Phase I were 1 × 108 cells/m2 or 2 × 108 cells/m2, and the Phase II part of the study tested the selected Phase I dose in more patients [62]. In both Phases of the study, a total of 29 patients were enrolled with a median age of 35 years (range: 23–69 years). All patients had a refractory disease and were heavily pre-treated with a median of eight previous regimens. There were 28 evaluable patients, of which 26 (8 in Phase I and 18 in Phase II) received CAR-T cell infusion (24 patients had classic HL, and the other two had T-cell lymphomas). In the eight patients enrolled in the Phase I part of the study, three patients received the lower dose of CAR-T cells (1 × 108 cells/m2) and all progressed. Of the other five patients who received the high dose (2 × 108 cells/m2), three patients had CR, one patient had SD, and one patient had PD. As there were no dose-limiting toxicities, the 2 × 108 cells/m2 was selected for the Phase II part of the study. Bendamustine (B) single agent was given for lymphodepletion in Phase I of the study. However, as response and CAR-T cell expansion were suboptimal, the investigators decided to add fludarabine (F), i.e., bendamustine and fludarabine combination (BF).",
        "Out of the 18 patients treated in Phase II, four developed CRS (three grade 1 that resolved spontaneously, and one was grade 2 that was managed by tocilizumab). There were also nine patients who had mild rashes after the infusion. Patients also had cytopenias in the form of grade 3 or high neutropenia in 3 patients (12%), thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia each occurring in four patients (15%). Of the 18 patients who received CAR-T cell infusion, 14 patients achieved CR (78%), of which two had a response longer than 1 year. Another two patients (11%) achieved PR; one patient had SD (5%). Only one patient had PD (6%). Of note, the CR rate was higher in the patients who had the combination of BF (78%) versus the patients who received B monotherapy (37%), with survival also being longer in those who had BF than those who had F alone (median of 389 days vs. 55 days). After a median follow-up of 108 days (range not reported), progression-free survival was 164 days for 19 evaluable patients who had active disease at the time of lymphodepletion. Patients who received the higher dose of CAR-T cells with the combination lymphodepletion regimen appeared to have a longer survival than those treated with a lower dose and single-agent bendamustine (median = 389 days vs. 55 days; p = 0.0004) [62].",
        "These data suggest the potential role of CAR-T therapy targeting CD30 HL. However, further studies with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up periods are needed to identify the role of anti-CD30 CAR-T cell infusion in HL.",
        "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell cancer, and despite the recent advances in treatment and the use of immunomodulatory, proteosome inhibitors, and other novel therapies, there is still no cure for it [63,64]. Current available therapies improve disease outcomes, but patients will ultimately relapse. Each relapse negatively affects survival chances for the patients [65,66].",
        "Superior results are seen with CAR-T therapy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and ALL encouraged the testing of CAR-T cell therapy in the disease of MM. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a protein and a tumour necrosis factor that is expressed by normal and malignant plasma cells including MM cells [67,68]. A specific CAR-T cell therapy (bb2121) was produced by the transduction of autologous T cells with a lentiviral vector that encodes a second-generation CAR-T that incorporates an anti-BCMA single-chain fragment, a CD137 (4–1BB) costimulatory motif, and a CD3-zeta signalling domain [69,70].",
        "CAR-T therapy has shown the potential to benefit patients with MM. In a pre-clinical Phase I study conducted by Raje et al., bb2121 (a CAR-T agent that targets BCMA) showed promising activity in patients with R/R MM [71]. The study consisted of two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion. In the dose escalation phase, a single infusion of CAR-T cells was tested in groups of patients in a dose-escalating manner. The doses that were tested were 50 × 106, 150 × 106, 450 × 106, and 800 × 106. In the dose expansion phase, only two doses were tested: 150 × 106 and 450 × 106. The study enrolled heavily pre-treated patients who received at least three previous lines of therapy (the median was 7 and the range was 3–14). With the exception of one patient, all patients previously failed an autologous stem cell transplant. All patients previously received and relapsed or were refractory to an immunomodulatory agent and a proteasome inhibitor. Some patients also had extramedullary disease (27%), and 45% of the patients had a high-risk cytogenetic profile with the presence of t(4;14), t(14;16), or del(17p). Safety was the primary endpoint of the study, and the safety results of 33 evaluable patients (out of 36 enrolled in the study) were reported. The main toxicity was haematologic toxicity, with events of grade 3 or higher reported for 85% of the patients in the form of neutropenia. Other grade 3 or higher toxicities were reported in the form of leukopenia, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia in 58%, 45%, and 45% of the patients, respectively. The non-haematologic toxicities were in the form of CRS, which occurred in 25 patients (76%). Most of the patients (23 patients, 70%) had a maximum of grade 2 CRS, and only two patients (6%) had grade 3 CRS. Neurologic toxicities occurred in 14 patients (42%), with only one patient suffering from a reversible grade 4 event and all the remaining patients having only grade 1 or 2. A CR was achieved in 15 patients (45%), one patient had PR (3%), and a median of PFS of 11.8 months was achieved. Of note, six patients out of the 15 patients ultimately relapsed. It is important to note that some responders had MRD negativity. The investigators concluded that BCMA-directed cellular immunotherapy for patients with R/R MM had toxicities similar to what was reported in other CAR-T cell therapies used for other indications. The therapy also resulted in promising responses in the form of CR/PR with doses of 150 × 106 in this heavily pre-treated patient population of R/R MM [71].",
        "In another first-in-human study (FIH), the anti-B-cell maturation antigen BiTE molecule was assessed in patients with R/R MM [72]. Patients who relapsed after at least two prior lines of therapies and no extramedullary disease were treated in the study. Patients received up to 10 cycles of treatment, given as an infusion every 4 weeks. The length of the cycle was 6 weeks. MRD was assessed using flow cytometry, and MRD negativity was defined as the presence of <1 cell/104 bone marrow cells. A total of 42 patients were enrolled in the study. The median age of the patients was 65 years. Patients had a median duration of MM of 5.2 years. The median number of cycles received by the patients was 1 (range: 1–10 cycles), while the responders received a median of 7 cycles. The doses received by the patients were in the range of 0.2–800 µg/d. Reasons for treatment discontinuation were disease progression in 25 patients (60%), adverse events in seven patients (17%), and death in four patients (10%). Likewise, three patients (7%) withdrew from treatment as they received the maximum allowable cycles in the study (10 cycles), one patient (2%) withdrew consent for continuation of treatment, and two patients (5%) were still on treatment at the time of the presentation of these data. Safety results have shown that the 800 µg/d was not tolerated, with two out of the three patients enrolled having a DLT, with one having a grade 3 CRS and the other one suffering from neurotoxicity (polyneuropathy) that started as grade 2 and progressed to grade 3. Both events were later resolved. For the patients who received the 400 µg/d dose, one patient had grade 1 polyneuropathy that progressed to grade 3 but ultimately resolved by week 12. CRS was seen in 16 out of the 42 patients (38%); however, it was treated with glucocorticoids, antihistamines, antipyretics, and analgesics, with one patient receiving tocilizumab for grade 2 CRS. Additionally, there were five patients who had increases in liver enzymes (ALT and/or AST > 3× times the upper limit of normal). Among them, four patients received the 400 µg/d. However, one of the four patients who had increased liver enzymes had increased enzymes at baseline. At the 400 µg/d dose, which was received in 10 patients, seven achieved a response rate of 70%. Among the seven responders, there were five patients who achieved MRD negative CRS. For the remaining two patients, one had a PR, and one had a very good PR. All the responses occurred in the first cycle, and some responses lasted >1 year. The investigators concluded that these results are promising and warrant further investigation [72].",
        "The CARTITUDE-1 was a Phase Ib/II trial that enrolled adult patients who were heavily pre-treated with three or more prior lines of therapy or were double-refractory to an immunomodulatory drug and a proteasome inhibitor. Patients received a single low dose of ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel), an autologous CAR-T therapy. Cilta-cel is a bioengineered T-cell receptor construct with a CD3ζ signalling domain, a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, and two BCMA binding domains. The Phase I study objectives were safety and defining a dose to carry forward to the Phase II part of the study. Patients underwent apheresis and cell collection to produce the CAR-T cells. The patients had lymphodepletion with 3 days of fludarabine 30 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2. The dose received of cilta-cel was a single dose of 0.75 × 106 cells/kg (range: 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/kg). At the time of the cut-off level of 1 September 2020, 113 patients were enrolled, with 97 receiving CAR-T (Phase Ib 29 patients and Phase II 68 patients). The median age of the patients was 61 years (range: 43–78 years), and the median number of prior lines of therapies was 6 (range: 3–18). Haematologic adverse events were the most common, with neutropenia, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia occurring in 96%, 81%, and 79% of the patients, respectively. Most haematologic adverse events resolved quickly without complications. Non-haematologic adverse events were CRS (95% of patients) and neurotoxicity (21% of patients). Most CRS events were grade 1/2 (95%). All CRS events resolved within 14 days of their onset in all but one patient. Only 10% of the patients who suffered from neurotoxicity had their events as grade ≥3. The number of deaths was 14, five of which were due to PD, three due to adverse events unrelated to the CAR-T therapy, and six due to adverse events related to the therapy. The efficacy results have shown that 67% of the patients achieved stringent CR, 26% achieved a very good PR, and 4% had PR. There were 57 patients who were evaluable for the assessment of MRD, 93% of whom became MRD negative. PFS at 12 months was 77%. The investigators recommended the testing of this CAR-T therapy in a larger clinical trial [73].",
        "The efficacy and safety of Ide-cel (bb2121) in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and in subjects with high-risk multiple myeloma (KarMMA Phase II study) also reported the results of Ide-cel, another CAR-T therapy targeting BCMA. Based on the Phase I promising activity, the Phase II study enrolled 140 heavily pre-treated patients with MM. The median age of the patients was 61 years. For lymphodepletion, the patients received cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 for 3 days. This was followed by the infusion of CAR-T cells in the range of 150–450 × 106. Of the 128 heavily pre-treated patients (median of prior 6 regimens) who received Ide-cel, and with a median follow-up period of 11.3 months, the overall response rate ORR (the primary endpoint of the study) was 73%, and the PFS was 8.6 months. The most common adverse events of any grade were cytopenias and CRS occurring in 97% and 84% of the patients, respectively. CRS was mainly grade 1/2, with only 5% having grade 3, one patient having grade 4, and one patient dying of CRS at the 300 × 106 dose of CAR-T. The response was durable, with 36% having CAR-T cells detected at 12 months. The investigators concluded that Ide-cel has demonstrated deep and durable responses in this heavily pre-treated patient population with an acceptable safety profile [74].",
        "The previously discussed studies in different haematologic malignancies represent a huge opportunity for patients who are suffering from those diseases. The fact that most of these studies are early phase studies with promising results and that there are planned Phase III studies represents great research opportunities for the scientific community and a chance for patients to be treated with a highly effective CAR-T therapy. These opportunities come with some challenges; the CRS is one of them. Some ongoing studies try to minimise this side effect while maintaining the superior outcome seen with CAR-T therapy [26]. Cost still represents a challenge to treatment with CAR-T therapy. Treatment with CAR-T cells is still not affordable for many patients in the approved indications. With the potential of more indications to come, the cost of treatment, either for the patients or any health care system, should be thoroughly evaluated, which also includes the cost of hospitalisation during treatment with CAR-T therapy and possible costs for the management of side effects [75].",
        "Treatment with CAR-T therapy has started a new concept for the treatment of patients with advanced ALL and DLBCL. The search for subsequent therapy for those who failed treatment with CAR-T therapy, together with the huge ongoing and planned studies in different haematologic malignancies, opens a new era of research and treatment with gene/targeted therapy. Although CAR-T therapy is currently approved for advanced/heavily pre-treated patient populations, the research activities will potentially be conducted in earlier disease settings. All the ongoing and planned activities lead to one conclusion: this is not the end of the chapter; it is the beginning of a new chapter or even chapters in our fight against different haematologic malignancies.",

    "title": "Preclinical Development and Evaluation of Allogeneic CAR T Cells Targeting CD70 for the Treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma. in normal tissue, making it an attractive CAR T target for an immunogenic solid tumor indication. Here we generated and characterized a panel of anti-CD70 single-chain fragment variable (scFv)-based CAR T cells. Despite the expression of CD70 on T cells, production of CAR T cells from a subset of scFvs with potent in vitro activity was achieved. Expression of CD70 CARs masked CD70 detection in cis and provided protection from CD70 CAR T cell-mediated fratricide. Two distinct classes of CAR T cells were identified with differing memory phenotype, activation status, and cytotoxic activity. Epitope mapping revealed that the two classes of CARs bind unique regions of CD70. CD70 CAR T cells displayed robust antitumor activity against RCC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Tissue cross-reactivity studies identified membrane staining in lymphocytes, thus matching the known expression pattern of CD70. In a cynomolgus monkey CD3-CD70 bispecific toxicity study, expected findings related to T-cell activation and elimination of CD70-expressing cells were observed, including cytokine release and loss of cellularity in lymphoid tissues. Finally, highly functional CD70 allogeneic CAR T cells were produced at large scale through elimination of the T-cell receptor by TALEN-based gene editing. Taken together, these efficacy and safety data support the evaluation of CD70 CAR T cells for the treatment of RCC and has led to the advancement of an allogeneic CD70 CAR T-cell candidate into phase I clinical trials. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate the efficacy and safety of fratricide-resistant, allogeneic anti-CD70 CAR T cells targeting renal cell carcinoma and the impact of CAR epitope on functional activity.

        "Urinary cancers, including prostate, bladder, and renal cancers, are major global health concerns. Prostate cancer ranks as the second most common malignancy in men and is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1]. Bladder cancer, with 82,290 new cases and 16,710 deaths reported globally in 2023, is the tenth most prevalent cancer, exerting a significant strain on healthcare systems [2]. Kidney cancer accounting for 5% of all cancer cases, is also among the top ten most frequent malignancies [3]. In total, recent reports estimate 168,560 new cases of urological cancers, with approximately 70% occurring in men, underscoring the male population's heightened vulnerability to these diseases [3]. Given the high incidence and associated mortality, developing innovative and effective research models is crucial.",
        "Traditional models for tumor research, such as two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and patient-derived xenografts (PDX), have been instrumental but have significant limitations. 2D cultures fail to replicate the complex three-dimensional (3D) architecture of tissues, leading to altered cellular behavior that limits their reliability. Hidalgo et al. highlighted the limitations of PDX models, including their slow establishment, high cost, and the confounding influence of the murine microenvironment on tumor behavior. While PDX models retain the in vivo architecture of tumors, they are not ideal for high-throughput drug screening due to these challenges [4]. These shortcomings highlight the urgent need for more accurate, scalable, and cost-effective alternatives for cancer research.",
        "Organoid technology has emerged as a groundbreaking solution, addressing many of the limitations associated with conventional methods. Organoids exhibit biomimetic structural features, enabling them to retain and express essential molecular signatures and genetic characteristics of their tissue of origin over extended periods. Additionally, organoids are relatively simple to cultivate and can be rapidly expanded, making them suitable for large-scale drug screening and gene-editing applications (Fig. 1A).Fig. 1Advantages of Organoid Technology and Its Applications in Precision Medicine: A. Organoid technology presents several key advantages over conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture systems and patient-derived xenografts (PDX), surpassing them in multiple aspects. B. Organoids can be derived from a variety of sources, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), adult stem cells (ASCs), and tumor cells. These organoids demonstrate rapid expansion potential across multiple generations. C. Disease-specific organoid models can be generated from patient tumor cells, providing a platform for in-depth investigation of gene therapies'anti-tumor efficacy. Additionally, these models facilitate the evaluation of both individual and combination drug treatments, supporting clinical decision-making to personalize therapeutic strategies and improve patient outcomes",

        "Organoids are self-organizing, 3D cell aggregates that replicate the architecture and function of in vivo organs. Derived from embryonic, induced pluripotent, or adult stem cells, organoids preserve the genetic stability and heterogeneity of the originating tissue, offering an in vitro model that mimics the complexities of human organs [5]. Their rapid and cost-effective development makes them an attractive alternative to traditional models, while maintaining the cellular diversity observed in tumor tissues.",
        "The formation of organoids begins with isolating stem cells from the target organ or tissue, which are embedded in matrix gels or scaffolds [6]. Under appropriate conditions, these scaffolds undergo structural changes to create a 3D environment that supports cell proliferation and attachment. Growth factors and cell-specific nutrients drive the differentiation of these cells into mature organoid structures, closely mimicking their in vivo behavior [7]. Organoids typically begin forming within days and mature within a week, providing a highly efficient platform for experimental applications (Fig. 1B).",
        "Compared to traditional 2D in vitro models, organoids offer significantly higher accuracy for clinical modeling, with success rates reaching up to 80% in high-throughput drug screening [8]. Furthermore, a recent shift in FDA policy, which eliminated the mandatory use of animal testing in drug development, underscores the growing preference for alternative research methods such as organoid technology [9]. Although challenges remain, such as the inability to fully replicate vascular and immune components, organoids have substantially advanced our understanding of cancer biology and therapeutic responses. The integration of technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 and microfluidics has further enhanced their capacity to model complex tumor microenvironments, providing valuable insights into disease mechanisms and drug efficacy testing [10, 11].",
        "While both traditional 3D cultures and organoid systems aim to mimic aspects of in vivo tissue, there are fundamental differences. Traditional 3D cultures, such as spheroids, often consist of homogeneous cell populations aggregated in a scaffold or matrix. In contrast, organoid cultures are stem cell-derived, self-organizing systems that develop into miniature tissue-like structures, maintaining the cellular diversity, spatial architecture, and functional characteristics of the original organ or tumor.",
        "The design of organoid models is governed by both biochemical and biophysical cues. Biochemically, growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) components direct cell fate and lineage specification. Biophysically, mechanical forces and spatial constraints influence morphogenesis, tissue organization, and cellular function. Together, these cues enable organoids to recapitulate complex tissue dynamics, offering a physiologically relevant platform for disease modeling and drug testing.",
        "Organoids are now central to precision medicine, enabling the development of patient-specific disease models. These models facilitate testing various drug combinations and therapeutic strategies, predicting treatment efficacy while minimizing the risks of toxicity and adverse effects. By leveraging patient-derived genetic data, organoid platforms have also become essential for gene-editing experiments, offering new opportunities for genetic correction in disease management (Fig. 1C). In recent years, integrating organoids with advanced bioengineering tools, such as 3D bioprinting, microfluidics and artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged as a novel and promising strategy. 3D bioprinting is a technology that uses advanced manufacturing techniques to precisely arrange cells and biomaterials in three dimensions, creating tissue-like structures that more accurately replicate the tumor microenvironment (TME). This allows for better modeling of cellular interactions within tumors and enhances drug testing (see 3D Bioprinting and tumor organoids for detailed discussion).",
        "Microfluidics involves the use of miniature channels to precisely control the environment in which cells are cultured, mimicking fluid flow and nutrient distribution found in human organs. This technique is especially useful in creating Organoids-on-a-chip, which simulates the behavior of tumors under different conditions (see Microfluidic organoids-on-a-chip for drug screening and personalized therapy for detailed discussion). AI plays a key role in analyzing large datasets generated by organoid experiments, such as imaging data. AI-driven platforms are used for automated analysis of organoid growth and drug response, improving the speed and accuracy of research (see Genetic engineering of tumor organoids for detailed discussion).",
        "These interdisciplinary approaches aim to address key limitations in current urological cancer models, such as lack of a dynamic tumor microenvironment, scalability, and limited predictive power for clinical translation. By employing microfluidic devices, organoids can be cultured under more physiologically relevant conditions that better mimic tissue architecture, while AI-powered image analysis enables more precise quantification of cellular behavior and drug response. This review explores the potential of combining organoid technologies with such bioengineering tools to pave the way for more accurate, high-throughput, and clinically relevant models for urological cancers.",
        "This review not only summarizes the progress of organoid technologies in urological cancers, but also proposes a translational framework that emphasizes their potential to bridge preclinical research and personalized medicine. By introducing a novel classification of organoid systems based on their clinical readiness, and by evaluating the integration of modern tools such as microfluidics, immune co-cultures, and AI, we aim to provide a forward-looking perspective on how organoid platforms can be optimized for real-world clinical application.",
        "The development of the urological tumor organoid platform is divided into four aspects: isolation of tumor cells from patients; 3D culture by scaffolding materials such as Matrigel; validation and characterization by various techniques such as hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, gene profiling, and flow cytometry; and finally, incorporation of validated organoid into organoid biobanks for molecular research, drug discovery, and therapeutic evaluation of precision medicine, tumorigenesis and development. Finally, the validated organoids will be incorporated into organoid biobanks for use in precision medicine, molecular research on tumorigenesis and development, drug discovery and efficacy assessment (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Development of a Urological Tumor Organoid Platform: A. Tumor Cell Acquisition: The process begins with the isolation of tumor cells from the patient, which is the foundational step in establishing the organoid platform. B. Three-dimensional (3D) Culture: Using scaffolding materials such as Matrigel, a 3D structure is cultivated to support organoid formation. C. Validation and Characterization: The authenticity of the cultured organoids is confirmed through various techniques, including hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), genetic profiling, and flow cytometry analysis. D. Applications: These validated organoid models have wide-ranging applications, including their integration into organoid biobanks, use in precision medicine, molecular studies of tumorigenesis and progression, drug discovery, and the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy",

        "The development of organoid technology has made significant strides since the pioneering work of Sato et al. in 2009, who first established intestinal organoids from Lgr5(+) stem cells [6]. This success laid the groundwork for later advances in cultivating organoids from prostate cancer tissue. Gao et al. were among the first to develop prostate cancer organoids from tumor biopsies and circulating tumor cells, successfully capturing the genomic diversity of metastatic prostate cancer, including PTEN deletions, TMPRSS2-ERG fusions, and SPOP mutations [12]. Drost et al. demonstrated that prostate cancer organoids preserve the key features of the primary tumor, including functional androgen receptor signaling, which is critical for prostate cancer growth. These organoids not only maintain the genomic fidelity of the original tumor but also offer a reproducible and scalable platform for functional assays. Importantly, organoids can be genetically manipulated to study specific tumor-driving mutations, something that PDX models or standard 2D cultures cannot replicate as efficiently [13]. These organoids effectively replicate the heterogeneity of prostate cancer, providing a powerful tool for studying disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses.",
        "Research using prostate cancer organoids has revealed critical insights into tumorigenesis. Studies, such as those by Karthaus et al., have identified luminal progenitor cells as key contributors to prostate cancer development [14]. By closely mimicking the native prostate architecture, luminal cell-derived organoids have advanced our understanding of cancer initiation and progression. Additionally, prostate cancer organoid models have been pivotal in evaluating androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which is central to prostate cancer pathogenesis [15]. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is widely used to treat prostate cancer, but resistance mechanisms, particularly in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), remain a major clinical challenge [16].",
        "Organoid models have become indispensable for high-throughput drug screening. Jansson et al., for example, screened 110 compounds on 15 prostate cancer organoid lines and identified HSP90 inhibitors as potent agents against prostate cancer [17]. Quantitative high-throughput imaging has also been integrated with organoid models to monitor drug responses in real-time, providing detailed insights into structural and compositional changes post-treatment [18]. Several therapeutic candidates, such as RGFP966, an HDAC3 inhibitor, and NEO2734, a BET-CBP/p300 dual inhibitor, have shown promise in prostate cancer organoid studies [19, 20] (Table 1).",

        "Targeted therapies have also been explored using organoid models. The dual-mTOR inhibitor RapaLink-1 and the fatty acid synthase inhibitor IPI-9119 have demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth in organoids [22, 62]. Additionally, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) inhibitors, when combined with CDK9 inhibitors, have shown enhanced anticancer activity in prostate cancer models [23]. Despite their success, scaling organoid models and fully replicating the complex biology of in vivo tissues remain key challenges. Future research will focus on refining culture methods and integrating advanced imaging technologies to improve clinical relevance.",
        "Renal cancer organoid models have been developed from both adult and pluripotent stem cells, offering new avenues for studying kidney cancer. Early work by Lam et al. and Morizane et al. showed that renal progenitor cells could be differentiated into structures resembling nephron units [54, 63]. These kidney organoids represent key functional units of the kidney, such as podocytes and tubules. However, the development of functional vascular systems within kidney organoids remains a significant hurdle. Studies utilizing decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) hydrogels and endothelial cell co-culture systems have advanced vascularization efforts, although challenges persist [55]. In a related study by Schutgens et al., kidney cancer organoids (tubuloids) were developed from patient-derived urine and kidney tissues. These organoids more accurately reflected the histological structure and functional behavior of renal cell carcinoma compared to 2D cell cultures. Moreover, compared to PDX models, organoids offer a scalable and efficient platform for testing drug responses in a manner that aligns more closely with the complex biology of renal cancers [56].",
        "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for the majority of kidney cancers, and recent advancements in organoid technology have allowed researchers to model specific RCC subtypes, including clear cell RCC (ccRCC). Na et al. successfully cultivated ccRCC organoids that retained key histopathological features of the original tumor, including lipid-rich cytoplasm and clear cell morphology 57. These organoids have been instrumental in drug screening efforts and in understanding the molecular drivers of RCC.",
        "Given RCC's resistance to conventional therapies, organoids have been valuable in testing novel treatment approaches. Anti-VEGF therapies, multi-kinase inhibitors, and immunotherapies have all been evaluated in RCC organoids. For example, Grassi et al. used organoids to assess foretinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, demonstrating its potential to induce apoptosis in RCC cells [58]. Organoid models have also been applied to immunotherapy research, with studies on CAR-T cells targeting CD70 and c-MET showing promising results in both in vitro and in vivo models [59]. However, the lack of immune components in current organoid models limits their utility for immunotherapy research, highlighting the need for more complex co-culture systems (experimental models that integrate multiple cell types—such as immune cells, fibroblasts, and tumor cells—into a shared environment to more accurately replicate the tumor microenvironment).",
        "Bladder cancer research has traditionally been limited by a lack of effective in vitro models. While early studies focused on culturing human urothelial cells, these models failed to fully capture the complexity of bladder cancer. Recent efforts have shifted toward organoid systems, which better replicate tumor architecture and cellular diversity. Kang et al. and Shin et al. made key advances in differentiating pluripotent stem cells into bladder urothelial cells, providing new insights into bladder cancer development and progression [60, 61]. As highlighted in Lee et al., bladder cancer organoids derived from patient samples exhibited superior genomic stability and heterogeneity compared to traditional 2D cultures. These organoids not only preserved the molecular characteristics of the primary tumors but also provided more accurate predictions of drug responses, mirroring clinical outcomes better than the monolayer cultures typically used in preclinical drug testing [33].",
        "Bladder cancer organoid biobanks have been established to provide a diverse array of models for studying drug responses and tumor evolution. Lee et al. created a biobank of organoids derived from 22 bladder cancer patients, which has since expanded to 53 samples [33]. These organoids retain the histopathological and genetic characteristics of the original tumors, offering a valuable resource for personalized medicine and drug testing.",
        "Bladder cancer treatment strategies are highly dependent on tumor pathology, with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) typically treated with transurethral resection and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) requiring more aggressive approaches, such as radical cystectomy. Organoids have been used to explore new therapeutic approaches, including Sirtuin 1 activators and selective MEK inhibitors. For example, SRT1720 has shown promise in inhibiting bladder cancer organoid growth, while trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, has been effective in targeting ERK pathway activation in organoid models [34, 64].",
        "Recent technological advances, such as microfluidic biochips and 3D bioprinting, have further expanded the utility of bladder cancer organoids. These innovations enable the creation of more physiologically relevant models that incorporate immune cells and endothelial cells, enhancing the accuracy of drug screening efforts. However, further refinement is needed to improve scalability and clinical translation.",
        "In the past decade, significant progress has been made in developing organoid models for urological cancers, including prostate, kidney, and bladder tumors. Organoid biobanks have been established, providing invaluable tools for studying tumor heterogeneity and drug responses. These models offer a promising platform for precision medicine, allowing for the evaluation of personalized therapeutic strategies while minimizing patient risk. Continued research will focus on overcoming current limitations, such as scaling production and incorporating immune and vascular systems, to further enhance the clinical applicability of organoid technology.",
        "While organoid models for urological cancers have significantly advanced in recent years, there are still some limitations, for example: incomplete microenvironment, heterogeneity loss over passages, lack of standardization, throughput constraints and limited clinical validation. Recent advancements in organ-on-a-chip platforms, co-culture models, and bioengineering tools are playing a key role in overcoming these limitations, offering new pathways to enhance the relevance, scalability, and predictive accuracy of organoid models for urological cancers (Table 2, Fig. 3).\nTable 2Limitations and solutions on organoid models of urologic cancerLimitationsConsequencesSolutionsIncomplete MicroenvironmentInability to reproduce the tumor microenvironmentCo-culture systems, Organ-on-a-chip platformsHeterogeneity Loss over PassagesLimiting the ability of organoids to reproduce clinical tumor complexitySingle-cell sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editingLack of StandardizationDifferences between studies leading to urologic tumor-like organsDevelop optimized protocolsThroughput ConstraintsRestricting the utility in high-content drug screeningIntegration with AI-driven automated platforms and microfluidicsLimited Clinical ValidationLimiting clinical useDevelopment of more robust in vivo models, Integration of organoid models with the PDX systemsFig. 3Recent advancements in tumor organoid technology: bioengineering integration: the convergence of bioengineering with organoid technology has driven significant innovations.

These innovations have led to the development of the\"organoid-on-a-chip\"model, which has progressed from single-organ systems to multi-organ and multi-system constructs. This approach enhances inter-system connectivity, improving the simulation of drug actions and metabolic pathways in vitro. Additionally, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) allows for more precise and efficient organoid image analysis. Model Optimization: To better replicate the immune and vascular systems, and to recreate a biomimetic tumor microenvironment in vitro, researchers have introduced additional cell types, such as vascular endothelial and immune cells, into organoid models. This refinement is crucial for enhancing the physiological relevance of these models in cancer research",

Advances in microfluidics and 3D bioprinting have enabled the construction of highly biomimetic tissue structures, both in terms of geometry and function. These innovations have led to the development of the\"organoid-on-a-chip\"model, which has progressed from single-organ systems to multi-organ and multi-system constructs. This approach enhances inter-system connectivity, improving the simulation of drug actions and metabolic pathways in vitro. Additionally, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) allows for more precise and efficient organoid image analysis. Model Optimization: To better replicate the immune and vascular systems, and to recreate a biomimetic tumor microenvironment in vitro, researchers have introduced additional cell types, such as vascular endothelial and immune cells, into organoid models. This refinement is crucial for enhancing the physiological relevance of these models in cancer research",
        "3D bioprinting has revolutionized biomedical research by allowing precise replication of complex biological tissues. This technology uses advanced manufacturing techniques, such as magnetic bioprinting and bio-inks (cell suspensions within hydrogels), coupled with computer-aided design to construct physiologically accurate structures [35]. By customizing scaffold parameters like morphology, pore size, and elasticity, 3D bioprinting replicates the tumor microenvironment (TME) with remarkable precision. These models enhance cell proliferation, migration, and nutrient delivery, offering more reliable conditions for studying tumor behavior.",
        "One key advantage of 3D bioprinting is its ability to incorporate various biomaterials, including collagen, gelatin, and polylactic acid, which mimic the ECM. By integrating different cell types—immune cells, fibroblasts, and tumor cells—bioprinting creates complex co-culture systems that provide deeper insights into cellular interactions within the TME. This goes beyond traditional organoid cultures, offering enhanced physical and biochemical complexity for cancer research.",
        "Recent applications of 3D bioprinting in urological cancer research include developing ex vivo models of the TME. For example, magnetic bioprinting has been used to co-culture renal cancer cells with fibroblasts, allowing a sophisticated representation of intercellular signaling [36]. Similarly, prostate cancer research has leveraged 3D bioprinting to explore interactions between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and hyaluronic acid (HA), key drivers of tumor proliferation and metastasis. In this model, optimized bio-inks allowed the study of how CAFs and HA promote cancer cell growth, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets [37].",
        "Bladder cancer research has also benefited from bioprinting. Acoustic droplet bioprinting, for example, has enabled the rapid creation of bladder cancer organoids co-cultured with immune cells. These models have shown the ability to generate tumor-reactive T cells, pointing to the potential of 3D bioprinting in developing personalized immunotherapy models. This technology thus holds promise for translating organoid research into clinical applications, particularly in immuno-oncology.",
        "Overall, 3D bioprinting offers a powerful tool for enhancing traditional organoid models, allowing the recreation of complex TMEs.

Despite these achievements, several technical and biological limitations still need to be addressed to fully exploit the potential of organoid technology for translational research and precision medicine.",
        "Organoid cultivation and standardization present several significant challenges that must be addressed for the broad applicability of organoid systems in research and clinical settings. Although organoids offer advantages over traditional models, their complexity introduces variability that can hinder reproducibility and comparability across studies. Key challenges in standardization include:Cell Source Variability: The use of different stem cell populations (e.g., pluripotent stem cells, organ-specific adult stem cells) leads to variability in organoid morphology, growth, and functionality. For instance, variations in the genetic background or differentiation protocols can yield organoids with distinct characteristics, even when derived from the same tissue type.Medium Composition and Culture Conditions: The culture media used for organoid maintenance can vary widely, including differences in growth factors, ECM components, and supplement formulations [49]. The absence of standardized, commercially available media leads to inconsistent results across different labs, affecting reproducibility.Biophysical Factors: The mechanical properties of the culture environment—such as matrix stiffness, nutrient gradients, and oxygen levels—can significantly influence organoid growth and differentiation. These factors often vary between studies, contributing to differences in tissue architecture and cellular behavior.Long-Term Cultivation and Passage Effects: Over extended passages, organoids may lose key features such as functional maturity or genetic integrity, leading to reduced reliability in long-term studies. This phenomenon underscores the need for standardized protocols to preserve organoid characteristics over time.High-Throughput Compatibility: While organoid systems are increasingly used in drug screening and large-scale studies, they remain difficult to integrate into high-throughput workflows due to challenges in consistency and scalability. Standardized protocols for large-scale production of organoids are essential to facilitate reproducible and efficient drug testing.",

Moreover, incorporating lymphatic systems into organoid models could offer new perspectives on metastatic spread and immune cell trafficking. Although the development of such complex models is still in its infancy, preliminary work using endothelial and lymphatic cell co-cultures within organoids has shown that these systems can be engineered to form functional networks. Further integration of vascular and lymphatic systems with immune components could lead to the establishment of comprehensive in vitro models that recapitulate the entire TME, enhancing the predictive power of these models for evaluating therapeutic efficacy and toxicity.",
