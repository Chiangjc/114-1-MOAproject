        "Neurological disorders encompass a wide range of debilitating conditions that affect the central and peripheral nervous systems, leading to progressive damage and loss of neural tissue. These conditions include neurodegenerative illnesses, which are typified by the build-up of abnormal protein aggregates and the progressive loss of particular neuronal populations. Examples of these illnesses are Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Huntington’s disease (HD) [1, 2]. Other neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury (SCI), involve damage to the myelin sheath and axons, disrupting neural transmission and causing functional impairments [3, 4]. Cerebrovascular disorders, including stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI), result in acute neural tissue damage and subsequent neuroinflammation, leading to long-term disability [5, 6]. Neurological disorders pose a significant burden on global health, affecting millions of individuals worldwide and leading to substantial healthcare costs and societal impact [7, 8].",
        "Current therapeutic approaches for neurological disorders primarily focus on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression rather than addressing the underlying pathology. This is in part because the precise etiology of many neurological conditions remains unknown, limiting our ability to develop targeted disease-modifying therapies. Pharmacological treatments, such as dopaminergic medications for PD, cholinesterase inhibitors for AD, and immunomodulatory drugs for MS, provide symptomatic relief but often have limited efficacy and side effects [9–11]. Rehabilitation strategies aim to promote functional recovery and adaptations but do not directly restore lost neural tissue [12]. Surgical interventions, such as deep brain stimulation for PD, can alleviate specific symptoms but do not halt or reverse the neurodegenerative process [13]. While progress has been made in developing neuroprotective agents and gene therapies, their clinical translation has been challenging, and their long-term efficacy remains to be established [14, 15]. Given the limitations of current therapies, there is a pressing need for novel approaches that can effectively regenerate damaged neural tissue, replace lost neurons, and promote functional recovery in neurological disorders.",
        "By utilizing stem cells' capacity for regeneration, stem cell-based therapies have become a viable option for treating the underlying pathophysiology of neurological illnesses. Because of their capacity to self-renew and differentiate into distinct cell types, stem cells are desirable in regenerative medicine [16]. Numerous stem cell types have been investigated for their potential as therapeutics for neurological illnesses, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [17, 18]. These cells offer a variety of alternatives for cell-based therapeutics since they can be produced from various sources, including adult bone marrow, adipose tissue, embryonic tissue, and reprogrammed somatic cells [19, 20]. Stem cells have a variety of therapeutic applications in neurological illnesses, including immunomodulation, cell replacement, paracrine signaling, and stimulation of endogenous repair mechanisms [21–23]. Preclinical studies in animal models have demonstrated the ability of stem cells to differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages, integrate into host neural circuits, and promote functional recovery in various neurological conditions [24, 25]. However, the clinical translation of stem cell therapies faces numerous challenges, including optimizing cell manufacturing, delivery methods, and safety assessments [26].",
        "This comprehensive review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the current state of stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders, focusing on the most recent advances and clinical applications. The review will discuss the biological properties and therapeutic mechanisms of different stem cell types, critically examine the preclinical and clinical evidence for their efficacy and safety, and highlight the challenges and future directions in the field. By synthesizing the latest research findings and expert opinions, this review seeks to inform researchers, clinicians, and stakeholders about the potential and limitations of stem cell therapies in revolutionizing the treatment of neurological disorders.",
        "Stem cells are unspecialized cells with the unique ability to self-renew and differentiate into various cell types, making them a valuable tool for regenerative medicine [27]. Understanding stem cells' fundamental properties and mechanisms is crucial for their therapeutic application in neurological disorders. This section provides an overview of the different types of stem cells, their sources, and their mechanisms of action in neurological therapies.",
        "Based on their potential for differentiation and developmental stage, stem cells can be categorized. All of the body's cell types can be produced by ESCs, pluripotent cells formed from the inner cell mass of blastocysts [28]. Nevertheless, there are hazards of tumor growth and ethical issues with using ESCs [29]. Adult stem cells are multipotent cells in bone marrow, adipose tissue, and the central nervous system. Examples of these tissues are MSCs and NSCs [30, 31]. Though less contentious and safer than ESCs, these cells have a more constrained capacity for differentiation [32]. Adult somatic cells are reprogrammed into a pluripotent state using particular transcription factors to create iPSCs [33]. iPSCs possess similar properties to ESCs but avoid the ethical issues associated with embryonic tissue use [34]. Other stem cell sources include perinatal tissues, such as umbilical cord blood and amniotic fluid, which contain a mix of multipotent stem cells [35].",
        "Stem cells exert their therapeutic effects in neurological disorders through multiple mechanisms, broadly categorized into cell replacement, paracrine signaling, immunomodulation, and stimulation of endogenous repair processes.Cell replacement: Stem cells can differentiate into specific neuronal and glial cell types, potentially replacing damaged or lost neural cells in neurological disorders [36]. For instance, dopaminergic neurons derived from stem cells can be transplanted into the striatum to replace degenerated neurons in Parkinson's disease [37]. However, the extent of cell replacement and functional integration of transplanted cells varies across different neurological conditions and requires further optimization [38].Paracrine signaling: Stem cells secrete a wide range of bioactive molecules, including growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular vesicles, which can exert neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative effects on the host neural tissue [39, 40]. These paracrine factors can promote the survival and regeneration of endogenous neural cells, modulate the immune response, and enhance angiogenesis and neuroplasticity [41, 42]. The paracrine mechanisms of stem cells are believed to play a crucial role in their therapeutic efficacy, particularly in conditions where cell replacement alone may not be sufficient [43].Immunomodulation: Neuroinflammation is a common feature of many neurological disorders, contributing to neural damage and hindering repair processes [44]. Stem cells, particularly MSCs, possess immunomodulatory properties that can regulate the immune response and create a more favorable environment for neural repair [45]. These cells can interact with various immune cells, such as T, B, and microglia, and modulate their activity through direct cell–cell contact and secretion of soluble factors [46, 47]. By attenuating neuroinflammation and promoting a pro-regenerative immune response, stem cells can indirectly support neural repair and functional recovery [48].Stimulation of endogenous repair: To encourage the proliferation, differentiation, and integration of endogenous stem and progenitor cells into the injured neural tissue, stem cells can activate and mobilize these cells in the brain [49, 50]. Growth factors and chemokines that draw endogenous stem cells to the injury site and promote their survival and differentiation can be secreted to do this [51]. Furthermore, stem cells can expand the brain's neurogenic and angiogenic niches, improving the conditions for endogenous repair mechanisms [52].",
        "Cell replacement: Stem cells can differentiate into specific neuronal and glial cell types, potentially replacing damaged or lost neural cells in neurological disorders [36].

These paracrine factors can promote the survival and regeneration of endogenous neural cells, modulate the immune response, and enhance angiogenesis and neuroplasticity [41, 42]. The paracrine mechanisms of stem cells are believed to play a crucial role in their therapeutic efficacy, particularly in conditions where cell replacement alone may not be sufficient [43].",

Furthermore, stem cells can expand the brain's neurogenic and angiogenic niches, improving the conditions for endogenous repair mechanisms [52].",
        "The therapeutic mechanisms of stem cells in neurological disorders are complex and multifaceted, often involving a combination of cell replacement, paracrine signaling, immunomodulation, and stimulation of endogenous repair. The relative contribution of each mechanism may vary depending on the specific neurological condition, the type of stem cells used, and the route and timing of administration [53]. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing stem cell-based therapies and developing targeted approaches for neurological disorders.",
        "However cell-based therapy for neurological illnesses encounters various obstacles despite its considerable potential:The potential of developing tumours, especially with pluripotent stem cells, is a concern [54]Allogeneic cell transplants can be rejected by the immune system [55]Cell survival and incorporation in the host tissue are restrictedThe possibility of unregulated differentiation or movement [56]There are ethical considerations related to the utilisation of embryonic stem cells [57]Issues related to scalability and manufacture of cell products that meet clinical-grade standards [58].",
        "The potential of developing tumours, especially with pluripotent stem cells, is a concern [54]",
        "Allogeneic cell transplants can be rejected by the immune system [55]",
        "Cell survival and incorporation in the host tissue are restricted",
        "The possibility of unregulated differentiation or movement [56]",
        "There are ethical considerations related to the utilisation of embryonic stem cells [57]",
        "Issues related to scalability and manufacture of cell products that meet clinical-grade standards [58].",
        "There are questions about the safety of anything over a long period of time, and it is necessary to do additional studies to continue monitoring it [59].",
        "These constraints highlight the significance of thorough preclinical testing and meticulous clinical trial design. Furthermore, it is imperative for regulatory frameworks to adapt in order to effectively tackle the distinctive obstacles presented by cell-based therapies [20].",
        "Each type of stem cell has unique benefits and drawbacks when it comes to its use in neurological applications. ESCs possess a significant degree of adaptability, but they can give rise to ethical dilemmas and pose the possibility of developing tumours [60]. Adult stem cells, such as MSCs and NSCs, have a narrower range of cell types they can develop into, but they may present fewer safety risks [61]. iPSCs offer a means of obtaining cells that are particular to each patient, but they must undergo thorough analysis to guarantee their safety and effectiveness [31]. When selecting a cell type, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the individual neurological disease and therapeutic objectives [35].",
        "Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles build up in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative condition that impairs memory, causes neuronal death and declines cognitive function [62]. Current pharmacological treatments, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, provide symptomatic relief but do not address the underlying pathology or halt disease progression [63]. Stem cell-based therapies have been proposed as a potential strategy to address multiple aspects of Alzheimer's disease pathology, including replacing lost neurons, providing neuroprotection, and modulating neuroinflammation [64].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of AD have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types, including MSCs, NSCs, and iPSCs, to ameliorate AD pathology and improve cognitive function. MSCs have been shown to reduce Aβ deposition, attenuate neuroinflammation, and promote neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in AD mouse models [65–67]. NSCs derived from human fetal tissue or differentiated from pluripotent stem cells have been reported to differentiate into cholinergic neurons and integrate into the host brain, improving cognitive function in AD animal models [68, 69]. However, transplanted cells' long-term survival and functional integration remain challenging [70]. iPSC-derived neural cells have also shown promise in preclinical studies, with the advantage of allowing patient-specific and genetically corrected cell therapies [71, 72].",
        "To date, only a limited number of small-scale clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in AD patients. A phase I trial using human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) demonstrated the safety and tolerability of repeated intravenous infusions in AD patients, with some evidence of stabilization of cognitive function [73]. Another phase I trial using autologous adipose-derived MSCs (ADSCs) showed safety and potential efficacy in slowing cognitive decline in mild to moderate AD patients [74]. However, these early-stage trials have limitations, such as small sample sizes, lack of placebo controls, and short follow-up periods, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of stem cell therapies in AD [75].",
        "Obstacles and prospects for the future although the preclinical results show promise, various hurdles must be overcome to successfully apply stem cell therapy in the clinical treatment of AD. These include enhancing the efficiency and quality of stem cells, enhancing the viability and effective integration of transplanted cells, and devising precise delivery techniques to specific brain regions impacted by AD [76]. Additionally, the optimal timing of intervention, the long-term safety and efficacy, and the potential need for repeated treatments need to be established through well-designed clinical trials [67].",
        "Future directions in stem cell therapy for AD may involve using genetically modified stem cells to enhance their therapeutic properties, such as increased secretion of neurotrophic factors or Aβ-degrading enzymes [77]. Combining stem cell therapy with other therapeutic approaches, such as Aβ immunization or small molecule inhibitors of Aβ and tau pathology, may provide synergistic benefits [78]. 3D organoid models derived from patient-specific iPSCs may also facilitate drug screening and personalized treatment strategies [79].",
        "Although stem cell therapy shows potential as a disease-modifying treatment for AD, additional research is required to tackle the obstacles and enhance the therapeutic strategy. Thorough preclinical investigations and well-planned clinical trials are necessary to determine stem cell treatments' safety, effectiveness, and long-term advantages in Alzheimer's disease. However, the complex and multifaceted nature of AD presents significant challenges for developing effective cell replacement therapies. AD involves widespread neuronal loss, synaptic dysfunction, protein aggregation, and vascular abnormalities across multiple brain regions. Simple cell replacement is unlikely to address all of these pathological features. Additional research is required to determine if stem cell approaches can tackle the numerous obstacles presented by AD's complexity and enhance therapeutic strategies [80].",
        "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological condition that gradually causes the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). This leads to motor symptoms, including tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement [81]. Current treatments, including dopaminergic medications and deep brain stimulation, provide symptomatic relief but do not address the underlying neuronal loss or halt disease progression [82]. Stem cell-based therapies aim to replace lost dopaminergic neurons and restore motor function in PD [83]. It is important to note that Parkinson's disease is not simply characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. The pathophysiology is complex, involving multiple neurotransmitter systems, protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and dysfunction of various neural circuits. For stem cell therapies to be truly disease-modifying or curative, they would need to address these multiple aspects of PD pathology. Recent research has highlighted additional challenges, including the potential spread of alpha-synuclein pathology to transplanted cells and the need to restore broader neural circuit function beyond dopamine replacement [84].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of PD have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types, particularly ESCs and iPSCs, to differentiate into dopaminergic neurons and improve motor function. Transplantation of human ESC-derived dopaminergic neurons into the striatum of PD animal models has shown survival, integration, and functional recovery [85, 86]. Similarly, iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons have demonstrated the ability to engraft, innervate the host striatum, and ameliorate motor deficits in PD models [87, 88]. However, challenges such as variability in differentiation efficiency, graft survival, and potential tumorigenicity need to be addressed [89]. PD models have also investigated MSCs for their neuroprotective and immunomodulatory properties [90, 91].",
        "Several clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies in PD patients. Early trials using fetal ventral mesencephalic (FVM) tissue grafts demonstrated variable outcomes, with some patients showing long-term clinical benefits and others developing graft-induced dyskinesias [92, 93]. More recently, clinical trials using human ESC-derived dopaminergic progenitors have shown promise. A phase 1/2 trial reported the safety and survival of transplanted cells in PD patients, with some evidence of motor improvement [94]. An ongoing phase 1 trial (NCT03119636) investigates the safety and efficacy of human ESC-derived dopaminergic progenitors in PD patients [95]. Clinical trials using autologous iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons are also in the planning stages [96].",
        "While stem cell therapy for PD has made significant progress, several challenges remain. These include optimizing the differentiation and purification of dopaminergic neurons, ensuring graft survival and functional integration, and minimizing the risk of graft-induced dyskinesias [97]. Strategies to enhance graft survival, such as co-transplantation with supportive cell types or neuroprotective agents, are being explored [95]. The development of standardized protocols for cell manufacturing and quality control is also essential for the reproducibility and scalability of stem cell therapies [98]. Future directions in stem cell therapy for PD may involve gene editing technologies to correct disease-causing mutations in patient-specific iPSCs [99]. Cell encapsulation or bioengineered scaffolds may improve graft survival and integration [100]. Combinatorial approaches, such as the co-administration of neurotrophic factors or the use of neuroprotective agents, may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of stem cell therapies [101].",
        "Stem cell therapy shows potential as a disease-modifying treatment for PD, aiming to replace lost dopaminergic neurons and restore motor function. Although there have been promising findings in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, additional research is required to tackle the obstacles and enhance the therapeutic approach. Continuing and upcoming clinical trials will offer valuable knowledge regarding the safety, effectiveness, and long-term advantages of stem cell therapies in PD.",
        "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-lasting inflammatory condition of the CNS that involves the immune system attacking and damaging the protective covering of nerve fibers called myelin. This damage results in neurological problems and impairment [102]. Current therapies for MS primarily focus on immunomodulation and symptom management but do not effectively promote remyelination or prevent progressive neurodegeneration [103]. Stem cell-based therapies aim to promote remyelination, provide neuroprotection, and modulate the immune response in MS. Among neurological conditions, multiple sclerosis (MS) stands out as having the most advanced clinical applications of stem cell therapy. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) is now routinely used in medical centers worldwide to treat aggressive forms of MS. This approach aims to 'reset' the immune system and halt disease progression [104].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of MS, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types to promote remyelination and ameliorate disease progression. Transplantation of NSCs or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) derived from ESCs or iPSCs has shown the ability to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, promote remyelination, and improve functional outcomes in EAE models [105, 106]. MSCs have also been extensively studied in MS models for their immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties [107]. MSCs have been shown to reduce neuroinflammation, suppress autoreactive T cells, and promote the generation of regulatory T cells, leading to improved clinical outcomes in EAE [108, 109].",
        "Several clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies in MS patients. aHSCT has been explored as a potential treatment for aggressive forms of MS to reset the immune system and halt disease progression. Comparing aHSCT to disease-modifying therapies found that aHSCT was superior in preventing disease progression and achieving sustained improvement in neurological function. Long-term follow-up studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients remain free from disease activity for 5 years or more after treatment [110]. While some studies have shown promising results, with long-term stabilization or improvement of disability in a subset of patients, the procedure is associated with significant risks. It is currently reserved for select patients with highly active disease [111, 112]. Clinical trials using MSCs have also been conducted in MS patients, primarily focusing on safety and feasibility [113]. Intravenous administration of autologous MSCs is well-tolerated, with evidence of potential efficacy in reducing inflammatory activity and promoting neuroprotection [102, 114]. However, more extensive randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the long-term safety and efficacy of MSC-based therapies in MS.",
        "While stem cell therapies hold promise for the treatment of MS, several challenges need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is ensuring the survival, differentiation, and functional integration of transplanted cells in the host CNS [115]. Strategies to enhance graft survival and promote targeted migration to sites of demyelination are being explored [110]. Another challenge is the potential for graft rejection or the development of secondary autoimmunity [116]. The use of autologous or genetically modified stem cells and the development of improved immunosuppressive regimens may help mitigate these risks [117]. Future directions in stem cell therapy for MS may involve using gene editing technologies to create \"off-the-shelf\" cell products with enhanced remyelination capacity or immunomodulatory properties [118]. Developing biomaterials and tissue engineering approaches to create scaffolds that support cell survival and guide axonal regeneration is also an active area of research [119]. Combination therapies that target multiple aspects of MS pathology, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, may enhance the therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation [120].",
        "Stem cell-based therapies for MS have shown promising results in preclinical studies and early clinical trials. While challenges remain, advances in cell manufacturing, genetic engineering, and biomaterial science are expected to improve the safety, efficacy, and accessibility of stem cell therapies for MS in the future. Further research and well-designed clinical trials are needed to establish the optimal therapeutic approach and long-term benefits of stem cell transplantation in MS. The success of aHSCT in MS has led to its inclusion in treatment guidelines for highly active relapsing–remitting MS that is refractory to conventional therapies. However, patient selection is crucial, as the procedure carries risks and is most beneficial for younger patients with active inflammatory disease. Ongoing research is focused on optimizing aHSCT protocols, reducing treatment-related risks, and exploring its potential in progressive forms of MS. Additionally, other stem cell approaches, such as mesenchymal stem cell therapies, are being investigated for their potential neuroprotective and regenerative properties in MS [121].",
        "Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, characterized by the sudden loss of blood supply to the brain, resulting in neuronal damage and functional impairments [122]. Current treatments for stroke primarily focus on restoring blood flow and providing supportive care but do not effectively address the long-term neurological deficits [123]. Stem cell-based therapies promote neuronal repair, modulate inflammation, and enhance functional recovery in stroke [124].",
        "Animal research investigating stroke has shown that different types of stem cells, such as MSCs, NSCs, and iPSCs, can enhance neuronal repair and functional outcomes. Studies have demonstrated that the transplantation of MSCs can decrease the extent of tissue damage caused by a lack of blood supply, regulate the inflammation of nerves, and improve the growth of new nerve cells and blood vessels in animal stroke models [125, 126]. NSCs, either from fetal tissue or generated from induced iPSCs, have shown the capacity to move towards the location of injury, transform into nerve cells and support cells, and enhance the restoration of function in stroke models [127, 128]. Nevertheless, the precise timing, method, and amount of stem cell administration and the sustained viability and incorporation of transplanted cells continue to be significant obstacles [129].",
        "Several clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in stroke patients. A meta-analysis of early-phase clinical trials using MSCs in ischemic stroke patients reported a favorable safety profile and potential improvements in functional outcomes [130]. However, the efficacy of MSC transplantation in stroke remains to be established in larger, randomized controlled trials. The MASTERS trial, a phase 2 study of intravenous administration of bone marrow-derived MSCs in acute ischemic stroke patients, showed no significant improvement in functional outcomes at 90 days compared to placebo [128]. More recently, the TREASURE trial, a phase 2/3 study of intravenous administration of umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs in acute ischemic stroke patients, also failed to demonstrate a significant improvement in functional outcomes at 90 days [131]. These results highlight the need for further optimization of stem cell therapies for stroke, including the selection of patients most likely to benefit, the timing and route of administration, and the potential for combination therapies [127].",
        "While stem cell therapies hold promise for the treatment of stroke, several challenges need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the limited survival and engraftment of transplanted cells in the ischemic brain [132]. Strategies to enhance cell survival, such as preconditioning or genetic modification of stem cells, are being explored [133]. Another challenge is the potential for off-target effects or the development of adverse events, such as tumorigenesis or stroke-associated infection [134]. The use of highly purified and well-characterized cell populations and rigorous safety monitoring will be essential for the clinical translation of stem cell therapies for stroke [135]. Future directions in stem cell therapy for stroke may involve using biomaterials and tissue engineering approaches to create a supportive microenvironment for transplanted cells and enhance their survival and differentiation [136]. Developing cell-free approaches, such as using extracellular vesicles or exosomes derived from stem cells, may also provide a more scalable and safe alternative to cell transplantation [137]. Combinatorial approaches, such as the co-administration of neuroprotective agents or the use of rehabilitation therapies, may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of stem cell transplantation [138].",
        "While stem cell-based therapies for stroke have shown promising results in preclinical studies, the clinical translation of these approaches has been challenging. Further research is needed to optimize the therapeutic approach, including selecting the most appropriate stem cell type, the timing and route of delivery, and the potential for combination therapies. Well-designed clinical trials with larger sample sizes and more extended follow-up periods will be essential to establish the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies for stroke.",
        "Muscle weakening, paralysis, and eventually death are the results of selective motor neuron loss in the brain and spinal cord that characterizes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative illness [139]. There are currently just a few ALS treatments available, and they mainly concentrate on supportive care and symptom control [140]. The goals of stem cell-based treatments for ALS are to reduce neuroinflammation, restore damaged motor neurons, and offer neuroprotection [141].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of ALS, such as the SOD1 transgenic mouse model, have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types to delay disease progression and extend survival. Transplantation of NSCs or motor neuron progenitors derived from ESCs or iPSCs has been shown to integrate into the spinal cord, form synaptic connections with host neurons, and improve motor function in ALS models [141, 142]. MSCs have also been extensively studied in ALS models for their immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties [143]. Intrathecal or intravenous administration of MSCs has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation, protect against motor neuron loss, and prolong survival in ALS mice [144, 145]. However, the long-term survival and efficacy of transplanted cells in the diseased microenvironment of ALS remain significant challenges [146].",
        "Several early-phase clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in ALS patients. Intraspinal transplantation of fetal spinal cord-derived NSCs in ALS patients is safe and well-tolerated, with some evidence of potential efficacy in slowing disease progression [147, 148]. However, a follow-up phase 2 trial did not significantly improve functional outcomes or survival compared to placebo [149]. Intrathecal administration of autologous MSCs has also been explored in ALS patients, focusing on safety and tolerability [137, 150]. While these early trials have provided proof-of-concept for the feasibility of stem cell transplantation in ALS, more extensive randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy of these approaches.",
        "Despite the promising preclinical results, the clinical translation of stem cell therapies for ALS faces several challenges. One of the main challenges is the complex and multifactorial nature of ALS pathogenesis, which may limit the therapeutic efficacy of cell replacement alone [151]. Strategies to enhance the survival, integration, and function of transplanted cells in the hostile microenvironment of ALS are being explored, such as the co-transplantation of supportive glial cells or the use of neuroprotective factors [152]. Another challenge is the potential for immune rejection or the development of adverse events, such as graft-induced dyskinesias or tumorigenesis [153]. The use of autologous or genetically modified stem cells and improved immunosuppressive regimens may help mitigate these risks [154].",
        "Future directions in stem cell therapy for ALS may involve gene editing technologies to correct ALS-causing mutations in patient-specific iPSCs, which could then be differentiated into healthy motor neurons for transplantation [155]. Using biomaterials and tissue engineering approaches to create scaffolds that support cell survival and guide axonal regeneration is also an active area of research [156]. Combinatorial approaches, such as the co-administration of neuroprotective agents or the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, may enhance the therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation [157]. Developing novel delivery methods, such as intramuscular or intravascular administration of stem cells, may provide a less invasive and more scalable approach for cell therapy in ALS [158].",
        "Although preclinical research on stem cell-based therapy for ALS has yielded encouraging findings, the practical application of these strategies has been complex. More studies are required on the most suitable stem cell type, administration timing and route, and the possibility of combination therapies to optimize the therapeutic strategy. More significant sample numbers and extended follow-up periods in carefully planned clinical trials will be necessary to confirm the safety and effectiveness of stem cell treatments for ALS. Additionally, the development of successful stem cell-based treatments for this debilitating illness will depend on a deeper comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of ALS pathogenesis and the interactions between transplanted cells and the host milieu.",
        "Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene, leading to the production of a mutant huntingtin protein that causes progressive neuronal loss and dysfunction, particularly in the striatum and cortex [159]. Current treatments for HD are limited and primarily focus on managing symptoms, such as chorea and psychiatric disturbances [160]. Stem cell-based therapies aim to replace lost neurons, provide neuroprotection, and modulate neuroinflammation in HD [161].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of HD, such as the R6/2 and YAC128 transgenic mouse models, have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types to improve motor function, reduce neuronal loss, and extend survival. Transplantation of fetal striatal tissue or NSCs derived from ESCs or iPSCs has been shown to integrate into the striatum, form synaptic connections with host neurons, and ameliorate motor deficits in HD mice [162, 163]. MSCs have also been explored in HD models for their immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties [164]. Intrastriatal or intravenous administration of MSCs has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation, increase neurotrophic factor levels, and improve motor function in HD mice [165, 166]. However, the long-term survival and efficacy of transplanted cells in the diseased microenvironment of HD remain significant challenges [167].",
        "To date, few clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in HD patients. A phase 1 trial of fetal striatal tissue transplantation in HD patients demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the approach, with some evidence of graft survival and clinical benefit [168]. However, a follow-up study found that the transplanted cells developed HD-like pathology over time, suggesting that cell replacement alone may not halt disease progression [169]. Recently, a phase 1/2 trial of intrastriatal transplantation of human ESC-derived neural progenitors in HD patients has been initiated (NCT03252080) [170]. This trial aims to assess the approach's safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy, with results expected in the coming years.",
        "While stem cell-based therapies for HD hold promise, several challenges must be addressed for successful clinical translation. One of the main challenges is the potential for transplanted cells to acquire HD-related pathology over time due to the presence of the mutant huntingtin protein in the host environment [171]. Strategies to mitigate this risk, such as genetically corrected autologous iPSCs or the co-transplantation of neuroprotective factors, are being explored [172]. Another challenge is the need for targeted cell delivery to the affected brain regions, as widespread neuronal loss and circuit dysfunction occur in HD [173]. Developing advanced imaging techniques and stereotactic surgery methods may help guide precise cell transplantation [154]. Future directions in stem cell therapy for HD may involve gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR–Cas9, to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific iPSCs, which could then be differentiated into healthy striatal neurons for transplantation [155]. Using biomaterials and tissue engineering approaches to create scaffolds that support cell survival and guide axonal regeneration is also an active area of research [156]. Combinatorial approaches, such as the co-administration of neuroprotective agents or the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, may enhance the therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation [174]. Developing novel delivery methods, such as intracerebroventricular or intrathecal administration of stem cells, may provide a less invasive and more widespread approach for cell therapy in HD [175].",
        "In summary, whereas preclinical research on stem cell-based treatments for Huntington's disease has yielded encouraging outcomes, the clinical application of these strategies is still in its infancy. More studies are required on the most suitable stem cell type, administration timing and route, and the possibility of combination therapies to optimize the therapeutic strategy. To prove that stem cell therapies for HD are safe and effective, well-designed clinical trials with bigger sample sizes and longer follow-up times will be necessary. Additionally, the development of successful stem cell-based treatments for this debilitating illness will depend on a deeper comprehension of the molecular mechanisms driving HD pathogenesis and the interactions between transplanted cells and the host milieu.",
        "A severe disorder known as spinal cord injury (SCI) causes the loss of motor and sensory function below the site of the damage, which frequently leads to permanent paralysis and impairment [176]. The main goals of current SCI treatments are to stabilize the spine, stop more injury, and encourage recovery [177]. The goals of stem cell-based treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI) include glia and missing neuron replacement, axonal regeneration, and inflammation response modulation [178].",
        "The potential of different types of stem cells to support functional recovery and regeneration has been proven in preclinical research utilizing animal models of spinal cord injury. It has been demonstrated that transplanting NSCs or neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from ESCs or iPSCs into the injured spinal cord can improve motor function in rodent and primate models of SCI by promoting the differentiation of neurons and glia and forming synaptic connections with host neurons. Since MSCs exhibit immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and pro-angiogenic qualities, they have also been the subject of substantial research in SCI models [179]. It has been demonstrated that administering MSCs intravenously or intraspinally to SCI mice can decrease inflammation, encourage tissue sparing, and improve functional recovery [180, 181]. Nonetheless, there are still significant obstacles to overcome, including the best time, method, and dosage for delivering stem cells and the integration and long-term survival of transplanted cells [182].",
        "Several clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in SCI patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials using MSCs in SCI patients found no serious adverse events related to cell transplantation and some evidence of functional improvement [183]. However, the included studies were small, heterogeneous, and lacked appropriate controls, highlighting the need for more extensive, well-designed trials to establish the efficacy of MSC therapy in SCI [184]. A phase 2 trial of intramedullary transplantation of human ESC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in subacute SCI patients (NCT02302157) has recently been completed, with results pending publication [185]. Other ongoing or planned trials investigate the safety and efficacy of various stem cell types in SCI patients, including NSCs, NPCs, and autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs [186].",
        "While stem cell-based therapies for SCI hold promise, several challenges must be addressed for successful clinical translation. One of the main challenges is the complex and dynamic nature of the injury microenvironment, which may limit the survival, differentiation, and integration of transplanted cells [187]. Strategies to enhance cell survival and promote targeted differentiation, such as co-delivering neuroprotective factors or biomaterials and tissue engineering approaches, are being explored [188, 189]. Another challenge is the potential for adverse events, such as neuropathic pain, autonomic dysreflexia, or tumor formation, following stem cell transplantation [190]. Careful patient selection, rigorous safety monitoring, and long-term follow-up will be essential to mitigate these risks [184].",
        "Future directions in stem cell therapy for SCI may involve gene editing technologies to engineer stem cells with enhanced regenerative properties, such as increased neurotrophic factor secretion or improved myelination capacity [191]. The development of advanced biomaterials and tissue engineering approaches to create scaffolds that mimic the natural extracellular matrix and guide axonal regeneration is also an active area of research [154]. Combinatorial approaches, such as the co-administration of rehabilitation therapy or the use of electrical stimulation, may enhance the therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation [192]. Additionally, identifying reliable biomarkers and imaging techniques to monitor the survival, differentiation, and integration of transplanted cells in vivo will be critical for optimizing and individualizing stem cell therapies for SCI [193].",
        "Stem cell-based therapies for SCI have shown promising results in preclinical studies, with growing evidence of safety and feasibility in early clinical trials. However, further research is needed to optimize the therapeutic approach, including selecting the most appropriate stem cell type, the timing and route of delivery, and the potential for combination therapies. Well-designed, randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and standardized outcome measures will be essential to establish the efficacy of stem cell therapies for SCI. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying SCI pathophysiology and the interactions between transplanted cells and the host microenvironment will be critical for developing safe and effective stem cell-based therapies for this devastating condition.",
        "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, resulting from sudden physical damage to the brain due to external forces, such as falls, vehicle accidents, or violence [194]. The primary injury initiates a cascade of secondary injury mechanisms, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and apoptosis, leading to progressive neuronal loss and dysfunction [195]. Current treatments for TBI primarily focus on minimizing secondary injury, managing intracranial pressure, and providing rehabilitation to promote functional recovery [196]. However, there are no effective therapies to reverse the damage and restore function in chronic TBI patients [197]. Stem cell-based therapies aim to replace lost neurons and glia, modulate the inflammatory response, and promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis in TBI [198].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of TBI have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types, including neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), MSCs, and HSCs, to promote functional recovery after TBI. Transplantation of NSPCs derived from ESCs or iPSCs into the injured brain has been shown to differentiate into neurons and glia, form synaptic connections with host neurons, and improve cognitive and motor function in rodent models of TBI [199, 200]. MSCs have also been extensively studied in TBI models for their immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and pro-angiogenic properties [201]. Intravenous or intracerebral administration of MSCs has been shown to reduce inflammation, promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis, and enhance functional recovery in TBI animals [202, 203]. HSCs mobilized from the bone marrow have been shown to migrate to the injured brain, differentiate into microglia and neurons, and improve cognitive function in rodent models of TBI [204]. While preclinical studies of stem cell therapies for TBI have shown promise, significant challenges remain in translating these approaches to clinical practice. Further research is needed to optimize cell types, delivery methods, and timing of intervention. Importantly, the complex and heterogeneous nature of TBI may require combinatorial approaches rather than relying solely on cell replacement strategies.",
        "Several early-phase clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in TBI patients. A phase 1/2a study of intravenous administration of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) in acute severe TBI patients demonstrated safety and a trend towards improved neurological outcomes [205]. Another phase 1 study of intracerebral transplantation of human NSCs in chronic TBI patients showed safety and feasibility, with some evidence of improved neurological function [206]. However, more extensive randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy of these approaches in improving functional outcomes and quality of life in TBI patients [207].",
        "While stem cell-based therapies for TBI hold promise, several challenges must be addressed for successful clinical translation. One of the main challenges is the heterogeneity of TBI, which can vary in terms of the mechanism, location, and severity of injury, as well as the age and comorbidities of the patient [208]. Developing personalized stem cell therapies tailored to each patient's specific needs may be necessary to maximize therapeutic efficacy [209]. Another challenge is the potential for adverse events, such as seizures, infection, or tumorigenesis, following stem cell transplantation [190]. Careful patient selection, rigorous safety monitoring, and long-term follow-up will be essential to mitigate these risks [210].",
        "Future directions in stem cell therapy for TBI may involve gene editing technologies to enhance the regenerative properties of transplanted cells, such as overexpressing neurotrophic factors or anti-inflammatory cytokines [211]. Research is also being done using biomaterials and tissue engineering techniques to make scaffolds that resemble the extracellular matrix seen in nature and offer a favorable environment for cell survival and development [212]. The therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation may be increased by combinatorial techniques, including co-administration of neuroprotective drugs, neurorestorative treatments, or rehabilitation [213]. Furthermore, developing noninvasive imaging modalities like PET and MRI to track the migration, survival, and differentiation of transplanted cells in vivo would be essential for customizing and streamlining stem cell treatments for traumatic brain injury [214].",
        "Stem cell-based therapies for TBI have shown promising results in preclinical studies, with early evidence of safety and feasibility in clinical trials.

Well-designed, randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and standardized outcome measures will be essential to establish the efficacy of stem cell therapies for TBI. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the complex pathophysiology of TBI and the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of stem cells will be critical for developing safe and effective regenerative medicine approaches for this devastating condition.",
        "Repeated, unprovoked seizures are a hallmark of epilepsy, a chronic neurological illness caused by abnormally high levels of aberrant brain neuronal activity [215]. Even though antiepileptic medications (AEDs) are the cornerstone of epilepsy treatment, over one-third of patients still do not respond to medication [216]. Intending to reestablish the proper balance between excitement and inhibition in the epileptic brain, stem cell-based therapies have become a viable adjunctive or alternative therapeutic option for drug-resistant epilepsy [217].",
        "Preclinical studies using animal models of epilepsy have demonstrated the potential of various stem cell types, particularly GABAergic interneuron progenitors and MSCs, to suppress seizures and modify the underlying disease pathology. Transplantation of GABAergic interneuron progenitors derived from ESCs or iPSCs into the hippocampus or other seizure-prone regions has been shown to engraft, differentiate into functional GABAergic interneurons, and reduce seizure frequency and severity in rodent models of epilepsy [218, 219]. These effects are mediated by the synaptic integration of the transplanted cells into the host circuitry and the enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission [220]. MSCs have also shown promise in preclinical epilepsy models, exerting anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects through the secretion of neurotrophic factors and the modulation of inflammatory responses [221, 222]. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of stem cell therapies in epilepsy remain to be established [223].",
        "To date, few clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies in epilepsy patients. A phase 1 trial of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) administered intravenously in children with refractory epilepsy demonstrated safety and feasibility, with some evidence of reduced seizure frequency [224]. Another pilot study of intracerebral transplantation of autologous BMMNCs in adult patients with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy also showed safety and potential efficacy in reducing seizure frequency [225]. However, these early-stage trials are limited by small sample sizes, lack of control groups, and short follow-up periods, highlighting the need for larger, well-designed, randomized controlled trials to establish the efficacy of stem cell therapies in epilepsy [226].",
        "While stem cell-based therapies for epilepsy hold promise, several challenges must be addressed for successful clinical translation. One of the main challenges is the complex and multifactorial nature of epilepsy, which may require tailored stem cell therapies targeting specific epileptogenic mechanisms in each patient [227]. Another challenge is the potential for adverse events, such as graft rejection, tumor formation, or worsening of seizures, following stem cell transplantation [228]. Careful patient selection, rigorous safety monitoring, and long-term follow-up will be essential to mitigate these risks [210].",
        "Future directions in stem cell therapy for epilepsy may involve gene editing technologies to create stem cell-derived GABAergic interneurons with enhanced anticonvulsant properties or reduced immunogenicity [229]. The development of advanced delivery methods, such as stereotactic surgery or convection-enhanced delivery, to achieve targeted and controlled transplantation of stem cells into the epileptic focus is also an active area of research [230]. Combinatorial approaches, such as the co-administration of neuroprotective agents or the use of gene therapy to overexpress seizure-suppressing molecules, may enhance the therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation [231]. Additionally, identifying reliable biomarkers and advanced neuroimaging techniques to guide patient selection, monitor the fate of transplanted cells, and assess the efficacy of stem cell therapies in vivo will be critical for optimizing and individualizing stem cell-based treatments for epilepsy [232].",

        "In addition to the neurological disorders discussed above, stem cell-based therapies have shown potential for the treatment of various other neurological conditions, such as cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and peripheral nerve injuries.",
        "A set of lifelong mobility abnormalities known as cerebral palsy are brought on by harm to the developing brain and first manifest in early childhood [233]. Current treatments for cerebral palsy primarily focus on managing symptoms and improving function through physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medications [234]. Stem cell-based therapies, particularly umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells and MSCs, have shown promise in preclinical and early clinical studies for cerebral palsy [235]. These cells have been shown to exert neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and pro-angiogenic effects, promoting brain repair and functional recovery [236, 237]. However, more extensive randomized controlled trials are needed to establish stem cell therapies' efficacy and long-term safety for cerebral palsy [238].",
        "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior [239]. While behavioral and educational interventions are the mainstay of treatment for ASD, there are no effective pharmacological therapies to address the core symptoms [240]. Stem cell-based therapies, particularly MSCs and NSCs, have shown potential in preclinical studies to modulate the immune system, promote synaptic plasticity, and improve behavioral outcomes in animal models of ASD [241, 242]. A few small clinical studies have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies in ASD patients, with some evidence of improved behavioral and cognitive function [243, 244]. However, these studies are limited by small sample sizes, lack of control groups, and short follow-up periods, highlighting the need for larger, well-designed clinical trials to establish the efficacy and safety of stem cell therapies for ASD [245].",
        "Peripheral nerve injuries caused by trauma, surgery, or disease can lead to sensory and motor deficits, neuropathic pain, and reduced quality of life [246]. Current treatments for peripheral nerve injuries primarily focus on surgical repair, physical therapy, and pain management [246]. Stem cell-based therapies, particularly Schwann cells, MSCs, and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), have shown promise in preclinical studies to promote nerve regeneration, remyelination, and functional recovery [247–249]. These cells can be transplanted directly into the injured nerve or delivered through nerve guidance conduits or other biomaterial scaffolds [250]. A few early-stage clinical trials have investigated the safety and feasibility of stem cell therapies for peripheral nerve injuries, with some evidence of improved sensory and motor function [176, 251]. However, further research is needed to optimize the therapeutic approach and establish stem cell therapies' long-term efficacy and safety for peripheral nerve injuries [247].",
        "While stem cell-based therapies for these neurological disorders hold promise, several challenges must be addressed for successful clinical translation. These include the heterogeneity of the patient population, the complex and multifactorial nature of the underlying pathology, and the potential for adverse events following stem cell transplantation [252]. Future directions may involve the development of personalized stem cell therapies tailored to each patient's specific needs, the use of gene editing technologies to enhance the therapeutic properties of stem cells, and the exploration of combinatorial approaches to enhance the efficacy of stem cell transplantation [253–255].",
        "Stem cell-based therapies have shown potential for treating neurological disorders beyond the well-studied conditions discussed earlier. However, further preclinical and clinical research is needed to establish these approaches' safety, efficacy, and long-term benefits. As regenerative medicine advances, it is hoped that stem cell-based therapies will become a viable treatment option for a wide range of neurological disorders, improving the quality of life for patients and their families.",
        "Stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders have made significant progress in recent years, with promising results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials. As highlighted in this comprehensive review, various stem cell types, including NSCs, MSCs, and iPSCs, have shown potential for the treatment of a wide range of neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury.",
        "The therapeutic potential of stem cells in neurological disorders is primarily attributed to their ability to replace lost or damaged neural cells, modulate the immune system, promote endogenous repair mechanisms, and provide trophic support to the injured or diseased nervous system. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of stem cells are not fully understood. They may vary depending on the specific neurological condition and the type of stem cells used.",
        "Despite the encouraging progress, several challenges need to be addressed to realize the full potential of stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders. These include optimizing stem cell sources, differentiation protocols, and delivery methods to ensure the therapeutic approach's safety, efficacy, and reproducibility. The potential for tumorigenicity, immune rejection, and other adverse events following stem cell transplantation also requires careful consideration and long-term monitoring. Furthermore, the complex and multifactorial nature of many neurological disorders may require combinatorial approaches that target multiple pathogenic mechanisms, such as gene therapy, neuroprotective agents, or rehabilitation in conjunction with stem cell transplantation.",
        "Several critical research areas must be prioritized to address these challenges and accelerate the clinical translation of stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders. These include the development of standardized protocols for the generation, characterization, and banking of clinical-grade stem cells, the establishment of robust preclinical models that more accurately recapitulate human neurological disorders, and the design of well-controlled clinical trials with appropriate patient populations, outcome measures, and follow-up periods.",
        "In addition to technological advancements, the successful clinical translation of stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders will require a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach involving basic scientists, clinicians, industry partners, regulatory agencies, and patient advocates. Ethical, legal, and social implications of stem cell research and therapy must also be carefully addressed through ongoing dialogue and public engagement.",
        "Looking to the future, the field of stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders is poised for exciting developments and breakthroughs. The convergence of stem cell biology with other cutting-edge technologies, such as gene editing, single-cell genomics, organoid models, and advanced neuroimaging, holds great promise for developing personalized and targeted therapies for neurological disorders. The increasing understanding of the complex interplay between the nervous system, immune system, and microbiome may also open up new avenues for stem cell-based therapies that harness the body's intrinsic regenerative capacity.",
        "In conclusion, while stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders are still in their early stages of development, the progress made so far is encouraging and holds great promise for the future. With continued research, collaboration, and innovation, it is hoped that stem cell-based therapies will become a safe, effective, and accessible treatment option for millions worldwide affected by neurological disorders, improving their quality of life and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. As the field continues to evolve, it will be essential to maintain a balanced and evidence-based perspective, acknowledging both the potential and the limitations of stem cell-based therapies and to ensure that the interests of patients and the public are always at the forefront of scientific endeavors.",

        "Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for treatment of solid tumors involves the direct surgical resection and prosection of a patient’s tumor tissue and ex vivo expansion of TIL, which reverses the dysfunctional state acquired in the tumor microenvironment by improving the phenotypic, functional, and tumor-reactive profile.1 2 Because TILs are obtained directly from a portion of the patient’s tumor tissue, they are differentiated from chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy by their polyclonality and ability to recognize and target a multitude of patient-specific tumor neoantigens to mediate tumor cell lysis.3",
        "The Surgery Branch at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) began the pioneering research efforts in TIL cell therapy in the 1980s. Studies in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with non-myeloablative lymphodepletion (NMA-LMD), TIL, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) confirmed clinical safety and demonstrated significant efficacy, with objective tumor regression in up to 55% of patients.4 5",
        "Since then, several studies from the NCI and other groups have aimed to optimize the regimen in patients with metastatic melanoma.6–10 Access to TIL has increased with the adoption of centralized manufacturing, increasing the number of sites available to offer this therapy. Current trials accrue multiple tumor types. Lifileucel, the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved autologous, cryopreserved TIL cell therapy product, showed clinically meaningful activity (independent review committee-assessed objective response rate (ORR) of 31.4% and median duration of response not reached at a median follow-up of 36.5 months) in a phase 2 study in 153 patients with heavily pretreated advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma after progression on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and targeted therapies (if BRAF-mutated).11 A recent phase 3 study conducted in the Netherlands and Denmark showed significant improvement in progression-free survival (7.2 vs 3.1 months; HR 0.50 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.72); p<0.001) and substantially higher ORR (49% vs 21%) with TIL cell therapy compared with ipilimumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who had received a maximum of 1 prior line of systemic therapy.12 The robust efficacy of TIL cell therapy observed in pretreated patients suggests the potential benefit of this approach soon after the failure of first-line ICI therapy. Early data are promising in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer13 14; recurrent, metastatic, or persistent cervical carcinoma15; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma16 17; and breast cancer.18",
        "As the use of TIL therapy becomes more widespread, historic best practices on management of high-dose IL-2 need to be reconsidered in the setting of the TIL cell therapy regimen, where IL-2 is used to support T-cell activity rather than used as a therapeutic agent.",
        "To this end, the TIL Working Group, composed of an internationally recognized multidisciplinary team including surgeons, hematopoietic stem cell transplant physicians, and solid tumor oncologists with expertize in TIL cell therapy, has been established in collaboration with industry experts to aid healthcare practitioners in better understanding and administering TIL cell therapy. The TIL Working Group members have treated numerous patients with TIL cell therapy in single-center and multicenter trials. Based on the evidence in the literature and members’ experience with treating patients with TIL cell therapy, the group has developed expert consensus recommendations for patient management, including pretreatment assessments, IL-2 administration, and toxicities. Additionally, key operational considerations and future directions for the success of TIL cell therapy are addressed. These are general consensus recommendations for TIL therapy, but for any patient on clinical trials, protocols should be followed strictly. Individual protocols may differ from these consensus recommendations.",
        "The overall course of TIL cell therapy and patient journey is illustrated in online supplemental figure 1. The process begins after discussion of treatment options and preliminary assessment for appropriateness of TIL by the primary oncologist. Potentially eligible patients who decide to pursue TIL cell therapy would be ideally referred to an authorized treatment center (ATC). TIL ATCs are centers that are certified to provide TIL cell therapy in the setting of a clinical trial or standard of care. To be deemed an ATC, the centers should have treatment teams that have experience treating patients with TIL cell therapy and/or care team providers who have undergone a training program in TIL treatment. Once a patient has been deemed a candidate for TIL cell therapy, the TIL Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) manufacturer (both in commercial and academic settings) is notified and the required materials for tumor tissue procurement surgery are obtained. The surgeon identifies the optimal lesion(s) and surgical approach in coordination with the treating physician. Currently, at least 1.5 cm (1.5–4 cm diameter) of tumor is required for TIL production. A tumor tissue procurement surgery is performed during which the surgical team resects and prosects (trims and fragments) the tumor tissue under sterile conditions, often in collaboration with pathology (taking utmost care that any material used for pathology review is kept separate from the tissue used for TIL manufacturing). The tumor tissue is transported for TIL manufacturing in sterile media containing hypothermosol, amphotericin B, and gentamicin, and prepared fresh on the day of tumor tissue procurement surgery and stored at 2°C–8°C until arrival of the courier for transport pick-up. In an academic/institutional setting, the TIL product is usually manufactured on site in a local certified GMP facility, whereas in a commercial setting, fresh tumor tissue is shipped to a centralized GMP facility to initiate TIL cell therapy manufacturing. Once manufactured, the cryopreserved TIL infusion product is shipped back to the ATC, where it is infused under the supervision of the treatment team.",
        "Prior to TIL infusion, patients receive a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting regimen (generally comprising fludarabine and cyclophosphamide), typically lasting 5–7 days, which may be administered in the inpatient or outpatient setting at the discretion of the treatment team. For current TIL products, cryopreserved TIL (thawed prior to infusion) or freshly manufactured TIL are infused after completing non-myeloablative lymphodepletion, followed by administration of a short course of high-dose bolus IL-2 every 8–12 hours over a period of 2–5 days to support growth and activity of the infused TIL (detailed below). In studies investigating lifileucel TIL cell therapy, up to 6 doses of IL-2 were often administered,19 20 whereas other studies investigating TIL cell therapy have used up to 15 doses of IL-2.12 Currently, hospital admission is required for supportive care and monitoring during TIL infusion and high-dose IL-2 administration. Patients are discharged when deemed appropriate by the inpatient care team, after sufficient hematological recovery and improvement from any IL-2 toxicity, approximately 14 days after TIL infusion (described in more detail below; online supplemental table 1). Some patients will require hydration and/or transfusion support of packed red blood cells and/or platelets after discharge, so close follow-up and coordination of care is needed. As with other cellular therapies, patients are encouraged to remain close to the treatment center (within 30–50 miles or <1 hour) with a designated caregiver for preplanned period (online supplemental figure 1). Thirty days after TIL infusion is a reasonable milestone, but the period of time may be shorter or longer depending on institutional guidelines and patient fitness, comorbidities, and toxicities that occur with treatment.",
        "Considering the challenges of managing advanced disease and the multiple steps involved in TIL cell therapy, timely and efficient planning and operational execution are critical. Patient selection for TIL cell therapy is a collaborative effort by a multidisciplinary team including the surgeon, medical oncologist, and often a cellular therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant physician. Case discussion should be performed in the setting of a multidisciplinary tumor board.",
        "At present, patients being considered for TIL cell therapy will have advanced disease that has progressed on prior lines of treatment including an antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1)–containing regimen, but they must be well enough to be able to wait for TIL manufacturing and scheduling of infusion, which may range from 22 to 60 days, and tolerate all components of the regimen, including the surgical procedure, non-myeloablative lymphodepletion (NMA-LD), cell infusion and IL-2. Patients must have at least one tumor lesion amenable to resection for TIL manufacturing and in clinical trials, an additional site of measurable disease has been required for response assessment. Efficacy in the setting of completely resected disease is unknown. Specific recommendations for surgical site selection have been described by Mullinax et al.21",
        "Critical parameters to consider when determining patient eligibility include performance status, renal function, cardiac function, and pulmonary reserve. Some considerations regarding these are described below.",
        "Performance status",
        "Tolerance of non-myeloablative lymphodepletion/IL-2 and organ reserve.",
        "In patients with rapidly progressive disease, the patient’s condition immediately prior to starting non-myeloablative lymphodepletion will need to be anticipated.",
        "Bridging therapy between the time of surgery and the start of NMA-LD should be considered in patients with a high disease burden and in patients with rapidly progressive disease or organ impairment that may prevent the patient from receiving TIL cell therapy. The optimal bridging therapy is one that is patient-specific and disease-specific and does not have major associated adverse events (AEs), as patients need to be eligible for TIL cell therapy after bridging, with adequate hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic recovery; however, in practice, such bridging therapy oftentimes does not exist. Careful consideration should be given to the necessary time to recover and clear the selected bridging therapy so as to avoid delaying initiation of the TIL cell therapy regimen. If bridging therapy contains cardiotoxic agents, consider repeating echocardiography, and if it contains pulmonary toxic agents, pulmonary function test (PFT) should be repeated. Regimens that require steroid administration should generally be avoided (discussed below).",
        "Brain metastasis",
        "Patients with untreated brain metastasis should generally not be considered for TIL cell therapy outside of a clinical trial due to the risk of intracranial bleeding, as data regarding safety and degree of efficacy are evolving. All lesions highly suspicious for active brain metastases should be treated and demonstrate stability without neurological symptoms post-treatment when a patient is off steroids prior to consideration of TIL cell therapy (see the section on special populations).",
        "Bowel metastases",
        "Patients with bowel metastases should be evaluated carefully for TIL therapy, as there is potentially an increased risk of bleeding and infection. However, given the lack of effective alternative therapies for these patients, risks and benefits should be weighed carefully and discussed with the patient.",
        "Renal function: Includes multiple considerations",
        "Adequate renal function (glomerular filtration rate ≥40 mL/min) is imperative for tolerating the full regimen.",
        "IL-2",
        "Renal toxicity secondary to IL-2: Includes both prerenal kidney injury related to third spacing of fluid and hypotension and intrinsic renal toxicity.",
        "Compromised renal function limits the ability to administer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which are an important premedication prior to IL-2 administration and other supportive agents with nephrotoxic risk.",
        "If there is evidence of any compromised renal function at baseline, consider avoiding/limiting NSAIDs to prevent worsening of renal function.",
        "IL-2 administration may have a cascade effect: IL-2 administration could lead to more injury leading to oliguria, which can worsen peripheral edema/effusions and other organ toxicity.",
        "It is also important to note that IL-2 is cleared renally, so decrease in renal function will impair the ability to eliminate IL-2 and increase the duration of exposure to/toxicity of IL-2.",
        "Creatinine levels should be within normal limits and creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be >60 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Although allowed in clinical trials, the TIL cell therapy regimen should be used with caution in patients with CrCl of 40–60 mL/min and may need to be modified:",
        "In patients with impaired renal function, fludarabine dose should be reduced (20 mg/m2 in patients with CrCl 50–79 mL/min and 15 mg/m2 in patients with CrCl 40–49 mL/min).",
        "The threshold to discontinue IL-2 due to toxicity should be lowered.",
        "Nephrotoxic agents (including NSAID premedication for IL-2) should be avoided.",
        "Diuretics should be avoided for at least 24 hours after the last dose of IL-2.",
        "We would not recommend this therapy in patients with CrCl<40 mL/min as it has not been studied in such patients and the risks may outweigh benefits.",
        "Cardiac function",
        "Functional cardiac reserve is necessary, as the TIL cell therapy regimen, IL-2, associated fluid shifts, hypotension, and compensatory tachycardia place stress on the myocardium.",
        "A left ventricular ejection fraction >45% on echocardiogram obtained during screening and New York Heart Association functional classification Class <1 are required.",
        "Patients who have a history of ischemic heart disease, angina, or clinically significant atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmias must undergo a cardiac stress test.",
        "A cardiologist should be consulted if there are any abnormalities and a risk/benefit discussion with the cardiologist is advised before pursuing TIL cell therapy.",
        "Pulmonary reserve",
        "This is important given the pulmonary risks of the regimen, such as pleural effusions, volume overload, and pulmonary edema. In addition, patients often require supplemental oxygen during treatment.",
        "Particular attention needs to be paid with certain malignancies, such as lung cancer, that are associated with smoking and associated comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/interstitial lung disease. Spirometry should be performed in these patients and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) should be measured; patients with moderate to severe impairment, that is, DLCO<50% or <40%, respectively, may not be candidates for TIL cell therapy.",
        "Patients should not require continuous oxygen supplementation prior to surgery.",
        "Although not required for all patients, screening PFT is recommended for patients having any of the following:",
        "History of cigarette smoking of ≥20 pack-years.",
        "Cessation of smoking within the past 2 years or still smoking.",
        "History of pneumonitis (including related to prior cancer treatment), COPD or asthma.",
        "Significant signs or symptoms of respiratory dysfunction, such as cough, wheezing, dyspnea, rales on auscultation, and abnormal chest X-ray.",
        "History of pleural drainage within the past 3 months.",
        "Postbronchodilator values: Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity>70% or FEV1>50% of predicted normal is recommended.",
        "If a patient is unable to perform reliable spirometry due to abnormal upper airway, a 6 min walk test may be used to assess pulmonary function. Patients who are unable to walk a distance of at least 80% predicted for age and sex or who demonstrate evidence of hypoxia at any point during the test (oxygen saturation<90%) should not receive TIL therapy due to the risk profile.",
        "A pulmonologist should be consulted in patients with borderline pulmonary reserve.",
        "Patients with FEV1<1.5 L may need chronic inhaled steroids and/or bronchodilators.",
        "For patients with pleural effusions, consideration of drainage or placement of temporary in-dwelling catheter is reasonable.",
        "In addition to the considerations above, patients should have adequately recovered from any prior therapy toxicity (including from prior immunotherapy) and should not require immunosuppressive dose of systemic steroids (typically no more than 10 mg of daily prednisone or equivalent steroid for physiological replacement) or biological agents; we expect this recommendation may evolve as clinical experience increases. Additionally, patients should meet institutional hematological parameters for starting non-myeloablative lymphodepletion and should not have uncontrolled active infections. In accordance with TIL study protocols, patients should not receive live or attenuated vaccines within 28 days prior to beginning the NMA-LD or within 3 months after the last dose of IL-2 and until the patient’s absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is ≥1000/mm3. In accordance with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations, patients vaccinated within a 14-day period before starting immunosuppressive therapy or while receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be considered unimmunized and should be revaccinated at least 3 months after therapy is discontinued provided that immune competence has been restored.22",
        "Online supplemental table 2 details additional considerations for TIL cell therapy eligibility as well as screening assessments that must be conducted.",
        "Tumor tissue procurement surgery should ideally be planned within 2 weeks of patient identification to minimize the risk of significant disease progression prior to TIL administration. Choosing the optimal anatomic resection site is critical to reduce patient morbidity and potential contamination of the TIL infusion product and requires close communication and collaboration between surgeons and medical oncologists. Surgical considerations and best practices for tumor tissue procurement have been previously described by Mullinax et al.21",
        "Surgical resection of a portion of the patient’s tumor provides the starting material for TIL cell therapy and is carried out at the ATC. TIL infusion products have been successfully manufactured using diverse sites for tumor tissue procurement such as skin, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissue, lung, liver, spleen, peritoneum, musculoskeletal sites, and breast.19 20 The current standards are that the operating surgeon resects approximately 1.5–4 cm diameter tumor tissue from a single lesion or an aggregate of smaller lesions, prosects (trims and fragments) the tumor tissue, taking care to remove necrotic and fatty tissue, and places it in sterile media for shipment to the manufacturing facility. Institutions should establish clear standard operating procedures for chain of custody and chain of identity from operating room to shipment and pathology review of the tumor sample if needed. The surgeon conducts postoperative follow-up, and the medical oncologist and/or cell therapy team typically coordinates the next steps in care.",
        "Possible complications resulting from surgery for tumor tissue procurement depend on the surgical site and can include wound dehiscence, infections of the resected area, and anastomotic/staple line leaks, which could affect patient fitness for non-myeloablative lymphodepletion and thus TIL infusion.23 An earlier study conducted at the Chaim Sheba Cancer Research Center in Israel reported 0% surgical mortality or major morbidity in patients receiving TIL cell therapy for metastatic melanoma; minor morbidity included only wound complications.24 Grade 3/4 tumor tissue procurement AEs related to surgery were seen in only 3% of patients in the recent C-144–01 trial and included cellulitis and post-surgical site-related AEs (n=2 each) and nausea, abdominal pain, and hypoxia (n=1 each); no patient had surgery-related AEs that prevented TIL infusion.19 25 In the Netherlands Cancer Institute and National Center for Cancer Immune Therapy (NKI/CCIT) trial, AEs related to surgery were reported in 17% of patients, 63% of which were postsurgical wound infections requiring antibiotics (J. Haanen, MD, personal communication, September 27, 2023).",
        "AEs related to the tumor tissue procurement surgery should be minimized and promptly managed by the surgical team. This starts with thoughtful selection of the tumor to be excised for TIL propagation. In general, a soft-tissue resection is favored over a visceral resection to minimize AEs. Regarding a required visceral resection, a minimally invasive approach is favored. It is preferable to avoid a bowel resection, but if required, small bowel resection is preferred over large bowel resection. In a patient with both lung and liver targets, a lung resection would generally be preferred. Prompt identification of surgical complications requires frequent communication with the patient. Early use of antibiotics in the setting of suspected postoperative infection is important. Deep abscesses should be drained percutaneously rather than via an open approach; a closed suction drain is placed when the abscess is substantial. Patients should be followed by the surgical team until resolution of significant tumor tissue procurement-related AEs. AEs should be promptly communicated to the cellular therapy team so that any required scheduling adjustments may be undertaken. The patient who has experienced a significant tumor tissue procurement-related AE should ideally be approved in advance of lymphodepletion by the surgical team.",
        "Non-myeloablative lymphodepletion prepares the tumor microenvironment by reducing the competition of the infused TIL for homeostatic cytokines (IL-7 and IL-15), and eliminating immunosuppressive cells, including regulatory T cells (Treg) cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, thus optimizing the milieu for activity of the infused TIL cells.26–29",
        "A dual or triple lumen large bore tunneled central venous catheter line 12–14.5 Fr or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line is inserted at the time of hospital admission. This provides venous access for delivery of the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen, infusion of TIL, IL-2 administration, and subsequent supportive care measures (antibiotics, transfusions, etc). The line may be kept in place until recovery.",
        "The non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen conventionally used in TIL cell therapy clinical trials includes cyclophosphamide 60–120 mg/kg and fludarabine 75–125 mg/m2. These doses are higher than those used in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (cyclophosphamide 30 mg/kg and fludarabine 75 mg/m2) and generally lower than those in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (cyclophosphamide 100–120 mg/kg and fludarabine 125–180 mg/m2).30 31 Our experience based on the C-144-01 trial for lifileucel and the NKI/CCIT trial currently supports the use of cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg intravenous daily (×2 doses), followed by fludarabine 25 mg/m2 intravenous daily (× 5 doses), although this may need to be adjusted for renal function and body mass index, as detailed in the renal toxicity section below.12 20 Exploration of lower dosing strategies is ongoing and may be integrated in the TIL regimen in the future.",
        "The checklist in online supplemental table 3 can be used for planning prior to non-myeloablative lymphodepletion.",
        "Cytopenias generally develop during and immediately after non-myeloablative lymphodepletion, with the lowest platelet counts occurring approximately 3–5 days after initiation of lymphodepletion, lowest lymphocyte counts on or around the day of TIL infusion (~7 days after initiation of lymphodepletion), and lowest neutrophil counts observed ~3–4 days after TIL infusion (~10–11 days after initiation of lymphodepletion). Platelet counts often recover by ~12–14 days, lymphocyte counts by ~4–7 days (which are mostly the infused TIL), and neutrophil counts by ~6–14 days after TIL infusion.6 32 In some patients, cytopenias can persist for weeks and repeated packed red blood cell or platelet transfusions may be required even after hospital discharge.",
        "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim) or biosimilar to treat neutropenia can be safely initiated the day after TIL infusion and is strongly recommended to reduce the incidence of myelosuppression and infections and potentially shorten the duration of hospitalization. The recommended duration of G-CSF administration varies but should be continued until the ANC is at least 500/mm3. This is distinct from CAR T-cell therapy where G-CSF warrants cautious usage because of its association with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) severity.33 TIL cell therapy is generally not associated with significant CRS. Patients typically receive filgrastim or biosimilar 5 µg/kg/day subcutaneously daily starting from the day after TIL infusion until neutropenia is resolved per standard of care at the treating institution. Using daily complete blood counts as a guide, patients should receive platelets and packed red blood cells as needed. Hemoglobin levels should be maintained at ≥7.0 g/dL and platelets >30 000/mm3 (unless patient is receiving anticoagulants) or per institutional standards for patients with comorbidities. Only irradiated blood products should be used for transfusion.",
        "Short-term and long-term antibiotic prophylaxis should be given to prevent opportunistic infections in the setting of drug-induced immunodeficiency. Antibacterial prophylaxis with levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally daily or equivalent should be started with the onset of neutropenia and continued until the ANC is >500/mm3. To prevent pneumocystis infection, prophylaxis is commenced with chemotherapy, typically trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole orally three times per week (or alternative). Antiviral prophylaxis should be commenced with chemotherapy, typically with acyclovir 400 mg or valacyclovir 500 mg orally (or alternative) two times per day .",
        "Duration of antipneumocystis and antiviral prophylaxis may vary per standard of care at the treating institution. The TIL Working Group recommends continuing these for 6 months (at least 3 months) post-TIL infusion and/or until CD4 counts >200 cells/mm3; they can be stopped earlier if the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) recovers to normal range. If ALC has not normalized by 3 months, then CD4 counts should be assessed, and prophylaxis continued if CD4 counts are <200 cells/mm3.",

        "In the setting of fever (temperatures ≥38.0°C), patients should be carefully screened for infections. It is important to note that while IL-2 often causes fever, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated for any neutropenic fever that occurs during the regimen. If fever is observed, urine and blood cultures should be performed; chest X-ray and sputum analysis are indicated in the event of pulmonary symptoms. During IL-2 administration, fever may be masked due to scheduled NSAIDs and acetaminophen. Therefore, in neutropenic patients exhibiting persistent hypotension or oliguria unresponsive to intravenous fluids, a high degree of suspicion for infection should be entertained and broad-spectrum antibiotics should also be considered. Fever during the time of bone marrow recovery is also common but should be a diagnosis of exclusion. Initiating or continuing administration of TIL or IL-2 to patients with neutropenic sepsis—or sepsis of any etiology—is not recommended.",

Vital sign monitoring is recommended every 30 min during infusion then hourly (±15 min) for 4 hours, and routinely (every 4–6 hours) thereafter, unless otherwise clinically indicated, for up to approximately 24 hours post-TIL infusion.

        "It is important to note that toxicities typically associated with other cellular therapies, such as high-grade CRS and immune-effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), are generally not observed with TIL cell therapy. The general absence of these toxicities is likely attributed to the naturally occurring, patient-specific T-cell receptors expressed in the TIL product, which have already undergone immune selection for self-tolerance. By contrast, CARs and T-cell receptor (TCR) T cells are engineered with high avidity and/or costimulation in construct, which increases rapid proliferation but also is more apt to cause pathological inflammatory cascade.",
        "Whereas CRS from CAR T-cell and TCR therapy is typically managed with tocilizumab and ICANS is typically managed with steroids, AEs with TIL cell therapy (eg, significant/recurrent fevers, hypoxia, neurological impairment) are more likely to be explained by alternative etiologies such as IL-2 or infection, and thus, are managed differently. Tocilizumab is not typically used in TIL cell therapy AE management. High-dose steroids (>10 mg prednisone equivalent) have been hypothesized to diminish TIL antitumor activity and thus are generally avoided.34 Exceptions exist in cases of life-threatening emergency or fluid-refractory hypotension for patients with known adrenal insufficiency. For further guidance, please see the section on adrenal insufficiency below. Given the significant differences in management of TIL cell therapy toxicity versus CAR T/TCR therapy, all team members should receive extensive training to ensure toxicity is recognized and managed appropriately. Toxicity management pertaining to each component of TIL cell therapy is discussed within each section. We recommend a ‘cheat sheet’ overview of toxicity management be provided to all team members, particularly staff who may be covering overnight and may be less familiar with this treatment regimen (online supplemental table 4). Uveitis after TIL infusion usually responds to topical corticosteroid treatment.",
        "The abbreviated course of high-dose IL-2 administered as part of the TIL cell therapy regimen functions as a supportive treatment to enhance T-cell activity and development after TIL infusion and differs from IL-2 monotherapy given with therapeutic intent, which is administered at high doses in repeat cycles. Patients who receive IL-2 as part of the TIL cell therapy regimen differ from patients who receive IL-2 monotherapy, as they have received non-myeloablative lymphodepletion and are, therefore, cytopenic. Although we attempt to preserve euvolemia prior to IL-2 administration, patients can also experience considerable fluid weight gain from the necessary hydration associated with the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen before receiving IL-2. We recommend diuresis in hemodynamically stable patients to try to achieve pretreatment body weight prior to beginning IL-2. Occasionally, prior to initiating IL-2, patients may experience significant toxicity from the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen that affects their ability to safely receive IL-2. In these cases, it may be necessary to forgo IL-2 treatment. In a small, as-yet-unpublished study in patients deemed ineligible for IL-2 because of age, organ function, or other comorbidities (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01468818), the ORR was 29.4% (5/17), suggesting that TIL may be effective in the absence of IL-2. Notably, we do not recommend TIL cell therapy for patients who are deemed in advance not to be candidates for IL-2, but it may need to be omitted if toxicity from the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen makes the patient unfit for IL-2.",
        "Antihypertensive medications should be discontinued 24 hours prior to IL-2 administration, and vital signs and urine output should be checked 2 hours prior to the first IL-2 dose so that abnormalities can be addressed. We recommend checking serum creatinine prior to beginning IL-2 and then two times per day during administration to monitor any changes in renal function. Avoiding intravenous contrast and other nephrotoxins is advisable to minimize renal insult.",
        "Supportive therapy prior to IL-2 administration includes acetaminophen every 4–6 hours or equivalent, indomethacin every 6 hours or other NSAID equivalent (recommended but should not be used if baseline renal function is poor and should be discontinued with any sign of decreasing urine output, rising creatinine, and when platelets are <50 000 x10ˆ9/L), pantoprazole 40 mg PO/intravenous daily or famotidine 20 mg PO/intravenous two times per day (or equivalent), meperidine 25–50 mg intravenous every 4 hours as needed and/or hydromorphone for rigors, antiemetics, and other medications as per institutional protocols. Maintenance fluids are typically not needed for IL-2 and fluids should be administered cautiously during active IL-2 treatment. Urine output should be assessed prior to each dose; the goal should be to maintain a urine output of at least 0.5 mL/kg/hour. We recommend holding IL-2 if the urine output falls below 4 mL/kg over a period of 8 hours.",
        "The first IL-2 administration in the TIL cell therapy regimen should begin approximately 3–24 hours after the completion of TIL infusion at a dose of 600 000 IU/kg intravenous every 8–12 hours typically up to a maximum of 6 doses. To facilitate optimal staffing, some centers initiate IL-2 dosing the morning after TIL infusion, rather than overnight. It may be helpful to schedule IL-2 infusions around standard vital times; however, administration should not be scheduled immediately preceding nursing shift changes.",
        "It is important to note that no clear correlation has been observed between the total number of IL-2 doses administered and efficacy of TIL cell therapy when the IL-2 was discontinued for toxicity.35 IL-2 can be held or discontinued at the discretion of the treating clinician at any time. Based on our collective clinical experience, we would be extremely cautious with rechallenging a patient with high dose IL-2 who has required a previous dose hold. If one dose is held, dosing can resume at the next scheduled dose if the patient has sufficiently recovered but should be done so with significant caution. If two consecutive doses are held, IL-2 should be permanently discontinued. As such, we strongly encourage holding or discontinuing IL-2 in the setting of toxicity that does not rapidly resolve with supportive medications. After IL-2 completion or discontinuation, IL-2-related medications including NSAIDs and meperidine should be stopped 12 hours later. Many patients will require supplemental oxygen during IL-2 administration due to capillary leak syndrome and fluid shifts resulting in pulmonary edema. The use of diuretics during the IL-2 period is a subject of debate. Some clinicians use intravenous diuresis with furosemide as needed in between IL-2 doses, with frequent electrolyte monitoring and replacement. If diuresis causes acute renal failure, IL-2 should be stopped.",
        "AEs resulting from IL-2 are typically transient due to its short half-life (distribution and elimination half-life of ~13 and ~85 min, respectively36). Renal filtration is the major route of clearance with a clearance rate of approximately 120 mL/min36 and effects peak several hours after exposure.

These symptoms can become severe and refractory and lead to other issues such respiratory deterioration if not identified quickly and managed appropriately. Prophylactic acetaminophen and NSAIDs should reduce severity and escalation of these symptoms. Management should include parenteral opioids, such as meperidine or hydromorphone per institutional standards. All fevers should trigger neutropenic fever protocols including empiric antibiotics. For guidance with respect to patients with adrenal insufficiency, please refer to appropriate section on TIL cell therapy considerations in special populations.",
        "To assess pulmonary side effects, physical examination and auscultation should be performed to check for rales in lung bases; chest X-ray should be obtained to assess for pleural effusions or pulmonary edema. Oxygen saturation should be maintained at ≥92%. We typically initiate oxygen therapy supportively if oxygen saturation is <95%. If the patient has an oxygen requirement, we recommend diuresis (if blood pressure can be maintained). Persistent oxygen requirement (<92% on room air) that has not resolved prior to the time the next dose is due is an indication to hold IL-2. After discontinuation of IL-2, it is common for fluid shifts to cause pulmonary edema and pleural effusions may cause oxygen requirement requiring intravenous diuresis for days.",
        "Hypotension is less common with the abbreviated course of high-dose IL-2 used for TIL than with therapeutic IL-2; about 8%–10% developed grade 3 or higher hypotension in clinical studies.12 19 Blood pressure target is based on baseline blood pressure and is assessed prior to each dose. For patients with blood pressure not meeting target, administer small (250–500 mL) normal saline (NS) or lactated Ringer’s (LR) bolus over 30–60 min. Repeat blood pressure 30 min after intravenous bolus, and if not meeting target, repeat another 250 mL intravenous bolus. If hypotension persists despite intravenous fluid boluses, IL-2 may be discontinued. Some centers with significant historical experience with high-dose IL-2 and/or TIL use pressors such as dopamine 2 µg/kg/min or phenylephrine 0.1 µg/kg/min (may be titrated up to obtain target blood pressure); when phenylephrine can be weaned to 0.5 µg/kg/min or less, it is safe to proceed with additional IL-2 dosing. However, use of pressors is not mandatory as it has been seen that the number of administered IL-2 doses is not associated with clinical outcomes when IL-2 is discontinued due to toxicity and abbreviated IL-2 dosing with discontinuation driven by clinical tolerance is feasible.35",
        "To assess renal toxicity, monitor serum creatinine two times per day, urine output prior to each dose; urine output should be at least 0.5 mL/kg/hour. If urinary output targets are not met, NS or LR 500 mL intravenous bolus over 30 min can be administered. Urine output should be checked 1 hour after intravenous bolus; if it is <50–80 cc/hour, then another 500 mL intravenous bolus may be repeated. Persistent low urine output despite intravenous fluid boluses, urine output <4 mL/kg over 8 hours, or serum creatinine 2.5–2.9 mg/dL are indications to hold IL-2. Creatinine level (measured every 24 hours) should also be closely monitored and taken into consideration when deciding whether to hold IL-2; IL-2 administration is held if levels increase by 100%. For example, for patients with low muscle mass and low baseline creatinine, an elevation from 0.5 mg/dL to 1 mg/dL may signal significant renal dysfunction and warrant at least holding a dose and we generally recommend discontinuation of IL-2. If CrCl is persistently low, select centers with previous IL-2 experience initiate dopamine at renal perfusion doses of 2 µg/kg/min. If dopamine is initiated, urine output of 50 cc/hour must be established while off dopamine before additional IL-2 doses may be considered. NSAIDs and nephrotoxic agents should be withheld in the setting of renal injury.",
        "Neurotoxicity due to IL-2 is not ICANS and should not be treated with steroids. ICANS has not been reported with TIL cell therapy. IL-2 therapy should be withheld until its course can be established, and we typically recommend discontinuing IL-2 permanently if there is evidence of IL-2-induced neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity is typically temporary, but in the setting of renal injury, IL-2 may take longer to clear, and neurotoxicity may persist for longer duration. Progressive development of personality changes, hostility, confusion, disorientation, and hallucinations may require treatment with antipsychotic drugs. This can be exacerbated by hospital-induced delirium and psychoactive medications, and delirium should not be mistaken for ICANS.",
        "Most AEs with TIL cell therapy are transient in nature, though events can be severe and life-threatening, especially if not managed appropriately. Much of the toxicity is observed during the first 14 days of therapy when the patient is expected to be in the hospital, and the appearance of new grade 3 or 4 toxicity after that period is unusual. In the C-144-01 trial, all patients experienced cytopenias consistent with non-myeloablative lymphodepletion, and the most common grade 3/4 non-hematological treatment-emergent AEs were chills (75.0%), fever (51.9%), and febrile neutropenia (41.7%).11 19 In the phase 3 NKI/CCIT trial that compared TIL cell therapy with ipilimumab as first-line or second-line treatment in advanced melanoma, all patients in the TIL group had grade 3/4 neutropenia; the most common grade 3/4 AEs were febrile neutropenia (74%), hypophosphatemia (60%), and fever (45%).12",

Platelet counts should be >20 000/mm3 independent of transfusion. G-CSF can be safely initiated the day after TIL infusion to reduce the incidence of myelosuppression and infections and shorten hospitalization duration. If oxygen was required during treatment, the patient should be diuresed and maintained as an inpatient until return to near baseline pulmonary status. Antibiotics are administered per institutional standards and if the patient is to maintain intravenous access, line care should be established. Patients must be able to safely perform activities of daily living and it should be feasible to manage any ongoing toxicity as an outpatient. Some patients will require hydration and/or transfusion support after discharge, so close follow-up and coordination of care are needed. It is recommended that patients remain in close proximity to the treatment center (30–50 miles or <1 hour) for 30 days after infusion, especially if they experience extensive cytopenias, as risk of post-IL-2 infection is higher compared with when high-dose IL-2 is administered in the immunocompetent population. Additionally, patients should be provided with all the necessary contact information for their care team, so they are aware of who needs to be contacted in case of any complications/emergencies.",

In some cases, patients may develop hypotension and require 2–3 times the usual maintenance fluids during lymphodepletion and/or IL-2 administration. Fluids can often be infused during lymphodepletion and tapered prior to TIL/IL-2 infusion. Endocrinology consult is recommended at admission. For patients with known adrenal insufficiency and/or prior hypophysitis, physiological replacement steroids (<10 mg prednisone equivalent) should be continued at home dosing throughout the regimen. In our collective experience, many patients with adrenal insufficiency will not require stress-dose steroids and hence, we do not recommend administering them prophylactically. However, we have a low threshold to administer stress-dose steroids if hypotension develops in patients with known adrenal insufficiency. In the setting of adrenal insufficiency and fluid-resistant hypotension, stress-dose steroids should be administered in consultation with an endocrinologist per institutional standards.",
        "Very limited data are available regarding the safety of TIL cell therapy in patients with untreated or actively growing brain metastases. The NCI group published a retrospective report on TIL cell therapy in patients with melanoma brain metastases that demonstrated preliminary efficacy of this approach,39 but with no published toxicity rates. The only significant toxicity that was reported was a subarachnoid hemorrhage in one patient who was thrombocytopenic from the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen. A clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility and safety of of TIL treatment in patients with active brain metastases is ongoing (NCT05640193).",
        "MRI of the brain should be obtained prior to starting the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen. Based on current data, we recommend that any untreated brain metastasis be treated with surgery or radiation therapy prior to beginning the TIL cell therapy process outside of a clinical trial. Patients with definitively treated brain metastases must be stable for ≥14 days prior to beginning the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen. It is recommended to exercise caution with hemorrhagic brain metastases. Patients who require steroids for symptomatic brain metastases should not be considered for TIL cell therapy. Because only patients with treated brain metastases are referred/recommended for TIL cell therapy outside of a clinical trial, antiseizure prophylaxis is not required unless the patient has had a seizure in the past. Consultation with the neurosurgery team is recommended if complications arise.",
        "The multistep TIL cell therapy process requires close coordination among multiple specialties and departments; thus, careful planning of surgery, admission, discharge, and follow-up supports a positive patient experience. Some of the aspects to consider when establishing a TIL cell therapy service line are detailed below (online supplemental figure 2).",
        "Identification of patients who may be candidates for TIL cell therapy may be a challenge, and the treatment window in which patients may be eligible could be narrow. Therefore, streamlining the referral pathway to ATCs is critical. Patient engagement materials and education through patient advocacy can help enhance awareness of this therapeutic option and improve understanding of the TIL cell therapy process and treatment expectations. Further, increased awareness among physicians will aid oncologists in considering how best to integrate this treatment modality in practice and ensure timely referral. Housing and supportive care considerations for patients and caregivers should be addressed to enable patient proximity (recommended distance is <1 hour) to the ATC for 30 days after TIL infusion. Social work evaluation is important to address social and caregiver ramifications and help to minimize financial encumbrance.",
        "One of the barriers to implementing TIL cell therapy is the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand in terms of resources. A state-of-the-art infrastructure is essential for all the steps in the treatment process, including scheduling logistics, patient referrals, surgery, TIL production, and infusion. Well-defined roles for the multidisciplinary teams, streamlined processes and optimal workflows, and clear communication among the TIL cell therapy team members are important for smooth treatment delivery. Institutions considering becoming ATCs will need to determine the number of patients who would be eligible for TIL cell therapy and their capacity based on hospital resources (eg, staffing, beds). Successful implementation will require staff training and education to provide adequate expertise; implementing infrastructure requirements, including appropriate staffing, appropriate storage and thawing conditions, inpatient beds in isolation rooms, monitored bed availability, and the availability of subspecialty consultants to manage any complications of treatment. It will also be important to consider reimbursement strategies and overall cost-effectiveness based on the expected number of treated patients.40 These challenges have been faced during implementation of CAR-T cell therapy and some critical success factors identified for successful implementation were collaboration among payers, manufacturers, and providers to streamline eligibility requirements and develop equitable reimbursement; better communication among providers and facility administrators within and across sites to evolve and optimize processes; and a commitment by manufacturers to generate robust and compelling health economic and outcomes research in support of these products.40 41 These lessons learnt from implementation of CAR-T cell therapy can be carried through to setting up processes for operationalizing TIL cell therapy.",
        "A consensus on preferred tumor resection sites and best practices to acquire the desired tumor tissue based on tumor type should be established. Different surgical specialists may be required for tumor resection according to anatomic location, so standardized workflows are critical to ensure that the process is reproducible and new team members can be easily integrated. To mitigate the risk of tumor tissue contamination, any equipment or instrument that comes into contact with the tissue during and after resection needs to be sterile, including instruments used for prosection and transfer media for transport. Once the tumor tissue is resected and prosected by the surgeon, additional logistics should be considered, as streamlining and standardizing workflow is critical to successful tissue procurement and TIL manufacturing. The portion of the tumor tissue designated for TIL manufacturing should be placed directly in the sterile medium and sent to the cell manufacturing facility via prearranged courier. Transport media must be prepared fresh on the day of tumor procurement using aseptic techniques in the operating room.",
        "Aseptic handling is required not only through tumor tissue procurement and placement into transport media, but through the packaging process as well. The two supply chains involved in TIL cell therapy, that is, transport of the tumor tissue from the ATC to the manufacturer and of the TIL infusion product from the manufacturer back to the ATC are complex and require careful handling, chain of custody, and accurate record management. Precise scheduling is crucial, as it can impact manufacturing and patient infusion. After resection, the tumor specimen container should be maintained at 2°C–8°C in a refrigerator until arrival of the prearranged courier for pick-up. Once manufactured, the final TIL infusion product requires cryopreservation during transportation from the manufacturer back to the ATC. Couriers will need to have contingency measures in place for unexpected delays such as transportation holdups and will need to ensure that cryogenic temperatures are maintained precisely during transport. The TIL infusion product should be kept frozen throughout any handling prior to preparation for thawing and infusion. A strong collaboration among manufacturers, couriers, the receiving laboratory, and clinical teams is essential to manage logistics efficiently.",
        "A nurse navigator who functions as a TIL cell therapy coordinator should be involved in the patient’s treatment journey from the initial discussion with the patient about the therapy, treatment process, and effects of the treatment. Clear guidelines are needed to determine which nursing staff will service TIL cell therapy (solid tumor staff or hematology staff who may already have experience and training for CAR T-cell therapies) and who will perform coordination of care during and after the regimen is administered. Other operational considerations include education programs and training for staff and creating educational sheets and seminars for staff in relation to dosing, safety mitigation strategies, emergencies, and care escalation.",
        "Pharmacy provides clinical pharmacist support during treatment. A clinical pharmacist’s responsibilities throughout this process may include patient evaluation; order set creation for non-myeloablative lymphodepletion; TIL product preparation and infusion; order set creation for IL-2 administration and management of expected symptoms; comprehensive patient, caregiver, and staff education; transitions of care; and pharmacovigilance and monitoring. Receipt, storage, and thawing of the TIL product can also be performed by appropriately trained pharmacies; in some facilities, this may be performed in a cell therapy laboratory.",
        "In some centers, cell therapy laboratories may be responsible for TIL manufacturing. In addition, these laboratories support the processing and storage of tumor tissue; process development; lot release testing and quality control; and preparation for infusion including thawing and delivery to the bedside. Laboratory staff have extensive GMP-compliant manufacturing, quality management, and regulatory experience to ensure compliance.",
        "The individualized nature of TIL cell therapy involving generation of autologous products is a complex process that includes tumor tissue procurement surgery, prosection, transportation to a manufacturing facility, TIL product manufacturing (expansion and reinvigoration), and transportation of the finished product back to the ATC where TIL cell therapy is administered to the patient. To overcome the traditional lengthy, cumbersome manufacturing processes that employed open-culture systems, improvements to manufacturing have focused on decreasing production time by enhancing TIL expansion capacity in vitro, minimizing the number of manufacturing steps performed in an open system, and incorporating a more closed system to minimize contamination, as well as exploring techniques to identify tumor-specific TIL in the original tumor sample to maximize expansion of this subset of lymphocytes.42 Production failures, contamination, long manufacturing turnaround times, and difficulties with transportation of the product are some of the challenges that must be considered. With manufacturing advancements, manufacturing success rates of 90%–98.8% have been reported.7 12 14 19 43 44 Automation, standardization of processes, and environmental control are required to reduce contamination and ensure optimal TIL yield in a timely manner. The potency of TIL drug product is assayed using a matrix approach that provides a comprehensive picture of the potency and identity by the selection of key complementary functional and phenotypic cell attributes. Functional attributes include the quantitation of IFN-γ secretion in response to T-cell stimulation by antibody coated beads and in coculture with a target cell line. Development of elements of the matrix was informed by the generally understood mechanism of action of TIL, extensive experience with the product and its characterization methods, evaluation of potential Critical Quality Attributes, and years of manufacturing and clinical experience for use in metastatic melanoma.",
        "The FDA currently requires manufacturers of CAR T-cell therapies to monitor patients for safety for up to 15 years.45 Unmodified TIL cell therapy does not require the same monitoring since it is not genetically engineered. In case of similar monitoring requirements for future genetically-modified TIL cell therapies, ATCs must consider data collection for long-term follow-up including defining the entities responsible for creating data platforms, ensuring accuracy of data collection, logistical challenges of long-term tracking, and funding requirements. Ordering tools and documentation for TIL cell therapy-specific assessments will need to be established. Syncing electronic medical records for patient medical history and TIL cell therapy information across multiple teams throughout the patient journey will be crucial right from patient selection to management of AEs.",
        "While the most extensive experience with TIL cell therapy is in the setting of non-uveal melanoma, this treatment modality is also being investigated in other solid tumor types such as non-small cell lung cancer,13 14 cervical cancer,15 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,16 17 breast cancer,18 uveal melanoma,46 and colon cancer.47 Distinct comorbidities and organ compromise with other tumors warrant consideration during TIL cell therapy and should include, at the very least, a consultation from a physician who has expertise with that tumor type.",
        "In the case of lung cancer, the associated distinct pulmonary and cardiac comorbidities, as well as older age and smoking, must be considered for surgery and treatment. Minimally invasive surgical techniques such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery wedge resection can be used for lung tumor tissue procurement. Holding or discontinuing IL-2 may need to be considered earlier due to low pulmonary/cardiac reserve. We continue to refine the use of TIL cell therapy in relation to melanoma and other solid tumors.",
        "TIL cell therapy manufacturing protocols have advanced in recent years to increase TIL yield and quality, making TIL cell therapy a potentially more viable treatment option for larger numbers of patients with different tumor types. Strategies to further enhance clinical and safety outcomes across various indications are being investigated, including optimizing the dosing of non-myeloablative lymphodepletion, TIL modification strategies such as neoantigen selection and gene editing, and novel IL-2 analogs. Novel areas for continued innovation in TIL cell therapy are emerging regularly.",
        "While the advancement of TIL cell therapy and related outcomes provides a promising outlook for patients in need of new options, unique challenges related to patient care and management will need to be addressed leveraging the knowledge and experience of teams such as the TIL Working Group. Educating physicians on administration of the regimen and managing toxicities is crucial to ensure that patients derive optimum benefit from the therapy. The best practices detailed here are intended to provide a framework for the complex issues involved in the management of patients receiving TIL cell therapy and may be of use to oncologists, intensivists, nurses, and other stakeholders involved in managing these patients. As with any novel therapy, these guidelines will be revisited as the field evolves.",

        "Osteoporosis is characterized as a quantitative and qualitative deterioration of bone tissues causing increased risks of fracture.\n1\n It is classified as primary (with unknown cause) and secondary (with traceable aetiology) osteoporosis. Primary osteoporosis is further classified as Type‐I post‐menopausal (between 50 and 70 years old) and Type‐II age related (more than 70 years old affecting both trabecular and cortical bone), while secondary causes of osteoporosis include hypercortisolism, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, alcohol abuse and immobilization.\n2\n Diagnosis of osteoporosis is mainly on the basis of T‐score, which reflects the bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar vertebrae and the femoral necks. Under the unified definition of WHO, patients with a T‐score < −2.5 standard deviation (SD) of the young female adult mean are diagnosed as having osteoporosis, while those with a T‐score between −1 SD and −2.5 SD of the young female adult mean are categorized as having osteopenia.\n3\n Moreover, the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) is considered to be efficient in estimating the long‐term risk of fracture.\n4\n Currently, the prevalence of osteoporosis among people over 50 years old in Europe and the United States is 4%‐6%,\n5\n, \n6\n while in Asia it is above 15%.\n7\n, \n8\n With the increasing prevalence resulting from the ageing population, osteoporosis has been recognized as a major public health concern.",
        "The mainstream treatment of osteoporosis is to stimulate osteogenesis or inhibit bone resorption through drug‐based agents.\n9\n Bisphosphonates, the predominant first‐line drugs to treat osteoporosis, decrease bone resorption by promoting osteoclast apoptosis.\n10\n Alternative anti‐resorption drugs include denosumab and calcitonin.\n11\n, \n12\n Oestrogen and raloxifene have been applied in hormone therapy to retard the process of bone breakdown and reduce fracture risk in post‐menopausal women.\n13\n Chinese medicines, such as rhizoma drynariae\n14\n and icariin,\n15\n have been shown to maintain BMD in osteoporosis. In addition, non‐pharmacological treatments such as vitamin D and calcium intake have also been used.\n16\n However, drug‐based treatments have two obvious drawbacks: First, they cannot reverse the existing bone loss, and second, they always lead to serious side effects, including osteonecrosis of the jaw, cancer, risk of thromboembolic events, and strokes.\n17\n Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative therapeutic methods for osteoporosis.",

The second step is the activation of cells by G‐protein coupled receptors, and integrin‐mediated, activation‐dependent arrest come next in the third step. The last step is the cells migrate through endothelial cells and underlying basement membrane.",
        "In the case of reduced homing ability, it is difficult to ensure that enough MSCs can reach the damaged tissue, which hinders bone repair.\n21\n Sanghani et al\n22\n showed that both ageing and osteoporosis impaired MSC migration, and this might be referable to a significant reduction in bone formation in patients with osteoporosis. More importantly, their study emphasized the positive effect of C‐X‐C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) overexpression on MSC migration. Haasters et al\n23\n found MSCs from patients with osteoporosis showed a surge in the migration upon bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP‐2) stimulation, as well as their invasion increased significantly upon BMP‐2 or BMP‐7 stimulation. Nevertheless, the invasion and migration capacity decreased significantly compared with those of the healthy controls. Therefore, increasing the total number of MSCs through cell transplantation or enhancing the homing of MSCs through gene modification or targeted peptides would be helpful to solve this problem.",
        "Common mesenchymal progenitor cells differentiate into various types of skeleton‐related cells is determined by multiple transcription factors and signalling pathways. The initial step in osteoblastic differentiation is the determination of a MSC to become an osteoprogenitor, in which mesenchymal progenitor cells are directed to preosteoblasts by runt‐related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), while chondrocyte and adipocyte differentiation are inhibited.\n24\n Next, RUNX2 and Osterix (OSX) guide preosteoblasts to immature osteoblasts expressing bone matrix protein genes, completely eliminating the potential for chondrocytic differentiation.\n25\n Furthermore, the BMP signalling pathway is generally acknowledged to play important roles in regulating the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.\n26\n BMP‐2 accelerates the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells.\n27\n However, BMP‐2 can act as a potent adipogenic agent if presented together with activators of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ (PPARγ).\n28",
        "The reduction of osteogenic differentiation is the core of osteoporosis. Rodriguez et al\n29\n detected MSCs from patients with osteoporosis that produced a type‐I collagen‐deficient extracellular matrix which favoured adipogenic differentiation in the preliminary stage. Wang et al\n30\n compared the MSCs of post‐menopausal women with osteoporosis and healthy volunteers, and confirmed that the sensitivity of MSCs to osteogenic differentiation was decreased in patients with osteoporosis. Pino et al\n31\n found that in patients with osteoporosis, the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was weakened, while adipogenic differentiation was strengthened, leading to a decline in bone formation and the accumulation of marrow adipose tissue (MAT). In order to reverse this trend, MSCs with better osteogenic differentiation ability should be transplanted. Reactivated the osteogenic differentiation ability of MSCs by gene modification and in vitro activator is also a feasible way.",
        "Osteoporosis is also associated with the senescence of MSCs. Zhou et al\n32\n discovered that the number of MSCs in elderly patients with osteoporosis was much lower than that in young people; the doubling time in MSCs from the older was 1.7‐fold longer than those from the younger subjects, and the content of β‐galactosidase related to ageing was four times that of young people. Stolzing et al\n33\n conducted in vitro passage culture of MSCs from 57 volunteers aged 5‐55 years, and the results showed that the proliferative ability and cell activity of MSCs decreased with age, accompanied by weakened osteogenic differentiation and relatively enhanced adipogenic differentiation. At present, gene modification is an effective strategy to delay the senescence of MSCs.",
        "Bone remodelling is a complex coordinated event requiring various cell types to activate synchronously in the microenvironment to ensure that both bone formation and bone resorption occurs successively to sustain bone mass.\n34\n This process starts at the initiation stage by activating osteoclasts under the regulation of osteoclastogenic factors, including receptor activator of NF‐κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (M‐CSF),\n35\n followed by osteoblast‐mediated bone formation. In this process, exosomes are regarded as paracrine regulators. The number of mature phenotypes differentiate from osteoclasts stimulated by osteoclast precursor‐derived exosomes is significantly larger than that in the absence of exosomes.\n36\n Nevertheless, osteoblast‐derived exosomes which contain RANKL can arouse osteoclast formation by activating RANK signalling in osteoclast precursors through the RANKL‐RANK interaction.\n37\n Xu et al\n38\n reported the existence of microRNAs (miRNAs) in exosomes during BMMSC osteogenic differentiation, which have been proven to repress adipogenesis and activate osteogenesis by enhancing key osteoblast signalling molecules. Moreover, this cycle is in the charge of bone lining cells and osteocytes.\n39\n Several coupling factors, including BMP, transforming growth factor β (TGF‐β), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), insulin‐like growth factor (IGF) and platelet‐derived growth factor (PDGF), are also involved in the process.\n40\n, \n41\n Dalle et al\n42\n found a lower OPG (osteoprotegerin)/RANKL ratio in the supernatants of osteoblastic culture from patients with osteoporosis than that from normal donors, which caused an alteration of osteoblastic differentiation and might contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Abnormal miRNA levels are also involved in the occurrence of primary osteoporosis through regulating osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation.\n43\n, \n44\n Therefore, disorders of important factors and signalling pathways regulating MSC differentiation in the microenvironment may cause an imbalance of bone metabolism, eventually leading to osteoporosis. Exogenous MSC transplantation is expected to redress the imbalance of microenvironment by regulating related factors and signalling pathways through paracrine.",
        "Recently, the close relationship between bones and the immune system has been recognized, particularly when both systems are activated under pathological conditions.\n45\n Immune cells can influence bone‐related cells by the secretion of various immune factors. Nearly all the subtypes of T cells can influence bone cells. Among them, the important roles of T‐helper(Th) 17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the regulation of osteoclast activity have been noted. Th17 cells have been proved to induce the expression of M‐CSF and RANKL in osteoblasts and MSCs, and increase the expression of RANK in osteoclast precursors, leading to excessive activation of osteoclasts.\n46\n, \n47\n With regards to Treg cells, their effect has been recognized to suppress osteoclast formation.\n48\n D’Amelio et al\n49\n found a significant increase in tumour necrosis factor α (TNF‐α) produced by T cells and monocytes derived from osteoporotic post‐menopausal patients, which stimulates osteoclast formation in bone loss induced by oestrogen deficiency. Dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer cells (NKs) also participate in osteoclastogenesis by regulating the subtype balance and activity of T cells through cytokine signalling.\n50\n, \n51",
        "On the other hand, MSC‐mediated osteoimmunology was also altered under osteoporotic conditions. Available evidence suggests that MSCs may stimulate the differentiation of Treg cells, and induce the apoptosis of the pro‐inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells.\n52\n, \n53\n Meanwhile, Corcione et al\n54\n found MSCs could inhibit migration of B cells to exert an immunosuppressive role in bone repair by downregulating the expression of chemokine receptors and their ligands. In addition, MSCs can also affect monocytes, DCs and NKs by secreting chemoattractant molecules.\n45\n Therefore, the interaction between immune cells and MSCs is paramount to bone metabolism, and the abnormal levels of inflammatory factors lead to the excessive activation of osteoclasts, leading to pathologic bone destruction and bone loss.",
        "MSCs can be insulated from amount of tissues (eg bone marrow, dental pulp, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, placenta and tonsil) and selective cultured prior to clinical use. According to their capacity to differentiate towards multiple mesenchymal lineages, MSCs have shown promises for wide applications in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Intra‐bone marrow and intra‐tail venous injections are common methods for MSC transplantation to treat osteoporosis (Figure 3).",
        "Preclinical studies on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in the treatment of osteoporosis",
        "Direct MSC transplantation has long been the focus of researchers, and the results based on osteoporotic animal models are relatively mature (Table 1). BMMSCs and ASCs have been widely used in ovariectomized (OVX) osteoporotic and age‐related osteoporotic models, and their effects on promoting osteogenic differentiation have been verified repeatedly. Meanwhile, dental mesenchymal stem cells improve OVX‐induced osteoporosis mainly through paracrine and immune regulation. For placenta‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (PDSCs) and umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), the mechanisms of osteoporosis treatment are mainly reflected in improved osteoblast activity and the weakening of osteoclast differentiation. Tonsil‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs) simultaneously enhance osteogenic differentiation and block MAT accumulation.",
        "Preclinical studies of direct MSC transplantation for osteoporosis",
        "Abbreviations: ASCs, adipose‐derived mesenchymal stem cells; BMD, bone mineral density; BMMSCs, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells; DPSCs, dental pulp stem cells; IBM, intra‐bone marrow; ICV, intra‐cardio ventricular; ITV, intra‐tail venous; MAT, marrow adipose tissue; OVX, ovariectomized; PDSCs, placenta‐derived mesenchymal stem cells; SHEDs, stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth; TMSCs, tonsil‐derived mesenchymal stem cells; UCMSCs, umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells.",
        "BMMSCs have been extensively investigated in bone regeneration and repair because of their osteogenic differentiation capacity.\n21\n A number of preclinical investigations implied that BMMSC transplantation in OVX model animals (eg rats,\n55\n, \n56\n, \n57\n mice,\n58\n rabbits\n59\n and goats\n60\n) could help to strengthen osteoporotic bones resulting from oestrogen deficiency: (a) Bone density increased significantly, indicating that bone destruction and loss could be reversed to some extent; (b) trabecular volume, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, percentage of trabecular area and trabecular spacing were increased, indicating that microstructural degeneration could be alleviated to some extent; and (c) the levels of osteogenic markers in serum, such as calcium, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN), increased after MSC injection. Furthermore, Uejima et al\n57\n and Wang et al\n59\n injected BMMSCs into distal femurs and evaluated their mechanical properties using biomechanical testing, illustrating that BMMSCs aided the preservation of mechanical properties. Yu et al\n58\n found after BMMSCs transplantation, the level of TNF‐α decreased, while T‐cell apoptosis, BMD, trabecular number, and bone volume fraction increased. This suggested that BMMSCs might play a critical role in treating oestrogen deficiency‐induced osteoporosis through immunoregulation of the apoptosis of T cells. Meanwhile, Kiernan et al\n61\n and Ichioka et al\n62\n observed long‐term engraftment and significant increased bone formation in age‐related osteoporosis after MSC transplantation. Therefore, BMMSC transplantation is likely to be a feasible therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat both oestrogen‐deficient and age‐related osteoporosis.",
        "ASCs have the advantages of easy accessibility, less donor site morbidity, satisfactory proliferative capacity and the ability to differentiate into multilineage cells, including osteoblasts and adipocytes.\n77\n In the cell therapy of osteoporosis, ASCs have been reported as effective autologous cells. The mechanism of improving OVX‐induced osteoporosis is similar to that of BMMSCs, which is mainly reflected in three aspects: (a) Significant increases in cortical thickness, bone volume density and bone load\n63\n, (b) improved trabecular microstructure\n64\n, and (c) increased serum calcium and OCN levels.\n65\n Ye et al\n66\n revealed that osteogenic‐induced ASCs promoted osteogenesis and inhibited adipogenesis of osteoporotic BMMSCs by activating BMP‐2 signalling pathway, which explained above as an important pathway in osteogenic differentiation. Liu et al\n67\n and Mirsaidi et al\n68\n also documented the effectiveness of ASCs transplantation in mice with age‐related osteoporosis. As mentioned earlier, an imbalanced microenvironment also plays important role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Despite the imbalanced microenvironments and related systemic inflammation of OVX donors, ASCs preserved anti‐inflammatory capacity and continued to safeguard bone formation in OVX recipients. However, BMMSCs from OVX‐induced osteoporotic mice failed to restrain bone loss after being infused back into OVX recipients for the incapacitation of anti‐inflammatory.\n69\n Meanwhile, Chen et al\n78\n proved that ageing and passaging had less effect on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of ASCs compared with that on BMMSCs. Liu et al\n67\n also verified that mice receiving young ASCs showed markedly higher osteogenesis (an average of 24.3% improved BMD) than those receiving aged ASCs. Therefore, ASCs are an encouraging therapeutic option for the osteoporosis treatment, because autologous ASCs preserve their anti‐inflammatory capacity under the general osteoporotic conditions compared with BMMSCs and are less affected by in vitro passaging.",
        "Dental mesenchymal stem cells have aroused research interests since their early discovery. Studies focusing on stem cells from the dental pulp of permanent and deciduous teeth to regenerate or repair non‐dental tissues have proved their effectiveness in bone, skin, nervous tissue, and vascular tissue regeneration.\n79\n Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) were reported to have a higher osteogenic capability compared with that of BMMSCs, and their adipogenic potential was found to be weaker than that of BMMSCs.\n80\n Kong et al\n70\n reached the following conclusions: (a) Some DPSCs could survive for more than 1 month in vivo. (b) DPSCs had higher homing efficiency when transplanted in the early period of OVX mice. (c) After administration, DPSCs were mainly distributed to the lung first and then in the liver; however, they were barely distributed to the bone. (d) Mediated by paracrine mechanisms, DPSC transplantation reduced OVX‐induced bone loss in trabecular bone of distal femur metaphysis significantly, suggesting systemic infusion of DPSCs was a potential treatment for OVX‐induced osteoporosis. Another multipotent stem‐cell population found in remnant dental pulp derived from exfoliated deciduous teeth are defined as stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs).\n81\n SHEDs are a peculiar postnatal stem cell population characterized by multipotent differentiation capacity and immunoregulation properties, thus cryopreserved dental pulp tissues of exfoliated deciduous teeth are considered as practicable stem cell resources for regenerative medicine.\n82\n They relieve osteoporosis mainly through immunoregulation. Liu et al\n71\n showed that systemic injection of SHEDs via the tail vein ameliorated OVX‐induced osteopenia by activating the Fas ligand (FasL)‐mediated Fas pathway, leading to up‐regulation of Tregs and down‐regulation of Th1 and Th17 cells. This SHED‐mediated immunoregulation increased bone mass by rescuing OVX‐induced impairment of BMMSCs and inhibiting osteoclast differentiation. However, SHEDs and DPSCs show different expression levels of the osteoblast markers for osteoblastic differentiation, suggesting that SHEDs exhibit a higher capacity for osteogenic differentiation in comparison with DPSCs and are noticeably different to DPSCs.\n83\n Furthermore, at early and late passages, SHEDs exhibit higher multiplication and osteogenic differentiation capacity compared with those of DPSCs.\n84\n Therefore, dental mesenchymal stem cells, such as DPSCs and SHEDs, could also be feasible alternatives in the treatment of osteoporosis.",
        "PDSCs are another abundant source of stem cells that have unique inherent characteristics.\n85\n Experimental evidence in OVX rats\n72\n, \n73\n indicated that human PDSCs had therapeutic effects on OVX‐induced osteoporosis. In addition to increased bone density, alleviated microstructural degeneration, and increased OCN and ALP levels in the serum, the transplantation of PDSCs also improved osteoblast activity and simultaneously weakened osteoclast differentiation, maturation, and functionality.\n72\n Further research suggested that transplantation of PDSCs might promote the expression of RUNX2 and OSX to achieve this effect.\n73\n However, the use of PDSCs always elicits political, ethical, moral and emotional debate over their application in research. Human UCMSCs do not need myeloablation for efficacy or to overcome allogeneic barriers to cellular therapies with banked cord blood.\n86\n Aggarwal et al\n74\n verified significant improvements in bone deposition, BMD and bone micro‐architecture after delivering UCMSCs systemically to the bone marrow in osteoporotic mice. The elevated levels of OCN in serum paralleled the advancements in bone micro‐architecture. Moreover, UCMSCs improved osteoblast activity and impaired osteoclast differentiation, maturation and functionality in the meantime.",
        "TMSCs, isolated from tonsils, have the potential to differentiate not only into the mesodermal lineage, but into the endodermal and ectodermal lineages, extending their potential use and identifying them as a fascinating option to consider for future investigations in cell therapy.\n87\n, \n88\n Kim's\n75\n results showed that double injection of TDSCs directly into the proximal tibia recovered serum OCN levels and triggered recovery of osteoporosis. In age‐related osteoporotic mice, Kim et al\n76\n injected TDSCs via the tail vein. The results demonstrated that TDSCs attenuated the progression of osteoporosis partially, not only by sustaining OCN production, but also by blocking MAT accumulation. Regulation of MAT together with bone could be considered to be a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of age‐related osteoporosis.",
        "To achieve improved osteogenic and angiogenic capabilities of transplanted cells, gene modification of important osteogenic and/or angiogenic genes has been taken into consideration before MSC transplantation. According to the included research, in general, five strategies have been used (Table 2): (a) Overexpression of osteogenic‐related genes, including BMP‐2, BMP‐6, RUNX2 and OSX; (b) knockdown of genes for bone destruction, such as receptor activator of nuclear factor‐κB‐Fc (Rank‐fc), to inhibit osteoclast activation; (c) overexpression of angiogenic genes, such as encoding fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and encoding platelet‐derived growth factor subunit B (PDGFB), to favour angiogenesis, thus promoting osteogenesis; (d) modification of homing‐related genes, such as activating CXCR4, to heighten homing and migration of MSCs; and (e) efforts to delay the senescence of MSCs, such as activating telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) to prolong or stabilize telomeres.",

        "The most common strategy involves overexpression of osteogenesis‐related genes. BMPs, affiliated with the TGF‐β superfamily, exhibit high osteogenic activity and can stimulate the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro and in vivo.\n102\n BMP‐2 is the most commonly studied. Both early and recent studies showed that MSCs, including BMMSCs\n103\n, \n104\n and ASCs,\n105\n showed restored osteogenic activity following BMP‐2 transduction. Further research indicated that BMP‐2 gene transduction could restore the osteogenic potential of MSCs, which might provide a useful method in the future planning of cell and/or gene therapy for primary osteoporosis\n89\n, \n106\n and osteoporotic bone defects.\n90\n, \n91\n, \n92\n, \n93\n Other BMPs have also been reported for osteogenesis. Pelled et al\n94\n and Shyen et al\n95\n showed that MSCs overexpressing BMP‐6 were capable of inducing spinal fusion in vivo, which could be used to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF). RUNX2 is a key transcriptional regulator that determines the fate of osteoblasts.\n107\n, \n108\n Expression of RUNX2 in osteochondral progenitors inhibits chondrogenic differentiation to enhance osteoblastic differentiation.\n25\n Conversely, inhibition of RUNX2 prevents MSCs from differentiating into osteoblasts.\n109\n OSX, a member of specificity protein 1 family (Sp1) of transcription factors with three zinc finger motifs, acts as a downstream factor of RUNX2.\n110\n The expression of RUNX2 plays a role at the initial differentiation stage, while OSX guarantees the complete differentiation of osteoblasts in the late stage.\n25\n Its inactivation impedes osteoblast differentiation and new bone formation.\n111\n Lee et al\n96\n found that nuclear factor I C (encoded by Nfic in mice) plays a transcriptional switch role in cell fate determination between osteoblast and adipocyte in BMMSCs by downregulating Osx expression. It is noteworthy that transplantation of Nfic‐expressing BMMSCs stimulated osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, and inhibited adipocyte differentiation in Nfic‐/‐ mice that showed an age‐related osteoporosis‐like phenotype.",
        "The second strategy is to inhibit osteoclast activation by blocking osteoclastogenic factors. RANK‐Fc, a recombinant RANKL antagonist, blocks receptor activator of nuclear factor ligand specifically.\n112\n Under normal circumstances, RANKL promotes osteoclast differentiation and maturation, while RANK‐Fc inhibits bone resorption by binding to RANKL to reduce the activation of osteoclast precursors.\n113\n Kim et al\n97\n validated whether the engraftment of Rank‐fc producing MSCs into bone produced bone‐protective effect. Their data demonstrated that MSC‐based gene therapy with Rank‐fc distinctly prevented bone resorption of OVX mice.",
        "Angiogenesis is an essential step before new bone formation; therefore, angiogenic genes could be modified to enhance the efficacy of transplanted MSCs. PDGFB is believed to mobilize and induce migration of MSCs or osteoblasts,\n114\n orchestrate cellular components for osteoblast differentiation,\n115\n and stabilize newly formed vessels.\n116\n Chen et al\n100\n proved that FGF2‐modified and PDGFB‐modified MSCs could increase trabecular bone formation and trabecular connectivity, decrease cortical porosity, and increase bone strength by 45%. There are several possible mechanisms for the effectiveness of these two growth factors, such as: (a) BMMSC proliferation, (b) HSC proliferation, and (c) angiogenesis that is essential for bone formation. Meanwhile, synergistic promotion of osteogenic differentiation and vascularization has also been reported. Kumar et al\n117\n transduced BMMSCs ex vivo with BMP‐2 and VEGF and transplanted them systemically into a mouse model of segmental bone defect. Results indicated that bone formation in the MSCs‐received group was enhanced and the therapeutic effects were along with increased vascularity, and osteoblastogenesis. Chen et al\n118\n isolated ASCs from minipigs and transfected them with recombinant human BMP‐2 and VEGF plasmids, respectively. Subsequently, the BMP‐2 + VEGF‐expressing MSCs effectively repaired bone defects of the ulna in the minipigs.",
        "The fourth strategy is to enhance the homing of MSCs. CXCR4, a specific receptor for CXCL12, is an important signalling factor in MSCs homing.\n119\n CXCL12‐CXCR4 signalling is also indispensable to maintaining the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool in adult bone marrow, which is closely related to osteogenesis and angiogenesis.\n120\n Sanghani et al\n98\n harvested MSCs from young and OVX animals. These cells were transfected with CXCR4 cDNA and administered intravenously in OVX rats. At 12 weeks after injection, the results of micro‐computed tomography (CT) and mechanical testing revealed that rats injected with young CXCR4‐overexpressed cells had a significantly higher BMD. Meanwhile, strategies to promote osteogenic differentiation and enhance homing could be used in combination to enhance efficacy. Cho et al\n99\n elucidated that intravenous transplantation of autologous Cxcr4‐overexpressing MSCs increased the homing of transplanted cells to bone in OVX mice, which could prevent bone loss and enhance the therapeutic effects of Rank‐fc.",
        "Senescence of MSCs acts as an indispensable part in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, therefore, efforts to delay senescence might be an alternative method to enhance the efficacy of transplanted cells. Telomerase can activate, prolong or stabilize telomeres, which are progressively shortened with cell division, proliferation and ageing. However, the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is very low in MSCs, which limits telomerase activity and results in the senescence of MSCs.\n121\n\nTERT gene knockout decreased the osteogenic ability of BMMSCs and osteoblasts significantly, and accelerated cell ageing, but did not affect the function of osteoclasts, resulting in loss of bone mass and osteoporosis. Saeed et al\n122\n found that the total bone mineral content and BMD decreased by 13% and 23%, respectively, after the Tert gene was knocked out in mice for 32 weeks. Li et al\n101\n proved that Tert‐transfected MSCs could help enhance proliferation and osteogenic differentiation ability in osteoporosis patients, so as to improve both bone mass and BMD, representing an effective material for further treatment of osteoporosis with autologous transplantation of MSCs.",
        "To improve the bone‐targeted efficacy of transplanted MSCs, targeted peptides that could transfer the MSCs to the bone surface, have been applied to modify MSCs. This new method of increasing the homing and retention of the MSCs to bone has been assessed in preclinical studies. Guan et al\n123\n have exploited an approach to guide MSCs to the bone surface by combining a synthetic high‐affinity and specific peptidomimetic ligand (LLP2A) against integrin α4β1 on the MSC surface to alendronate (Ale), which has a high appetence for bone. They have shown that LLP2A‐Ale directs the transplanted MSCs to the bone to augment endogenous bone formation and bone mass. LLP2A‐Ale also prevented trabecular bone loss after peak bone acquisition was achieved or as a result of oestrogen deficiency.",
        "Targeted peptide and gene modification can also be used in combination. Chen et al\n124\n put forward a strategy that utilized the high appetency of a unique DSS6 peptide (six repetitive sequences of aspartate, serine and serine) for bone surfaces and employed this peptide as a novel targeting vehicle to deliver and retain PDGFB at the site of bone loss. The result revealed that a large augment in bone formation could be achieved by engrafting an extremely low level of MSCs in the OVX mice. Compared with other groups, ALP levels increased by approximately 75% and trabecular bone density increased massively in the PDGFB‐DSS6 group.",
        "Some studies have reported that abnormal activation changes in OVX‐MSCs might decrease their effects in the treatment of osteoporosis. Thus, it would be beneficial to develop a special in vitro co‐culture system to enhance the proliferation, homing and osteogenic differentiation ability of MSCs to improve their performance. Saito et al\n125\n developed a new activator for BMMSCs called Wharton's jelly extract supernatant (WJS), using human umbilical cord extracts, which contained various physiologically active substances. The results showed the proliferation of OVX‐MSCs was increased by co‐culturing with WJS in vitro, which was identified to be profitable for cell therapy to secure a sufficient number of cells from bone marrow for transplantation in a relatively brief period. The BMMSCs homing ability to damaged tissues was also improved. This would greatly benefit therapeutic efficiency by promoting cell distribution. The fusion of osteoclasts and bone resorption was inhibited. Trabecular bone volume and thickness were improved significantly in vivo by transplanting WJS‐activated OVX‐MSCs, as observed using micro‐CT.",
        "During bone formation, angiogenesis and osteogenesis are mutually interdependent.\n126\n The application of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) has been shown to initiate and facilitate neovascularization.\n127\n He et al\n128\n demonstrated that co‐culture of BMP‐2‐modified MSCs and EPCs significantly increased the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs and endothelial differentiation of EPCs in vitro, and co‐transplantation of both cells promoted the growth of new blood vessels and osteogenesis in vivo.",
        "Increased research attention has concentrated on co‐localization of the MSCs and HSCs niches and their functional interdependence within the bone marrow. MSCs are key elements in the bone marrow niche, where HSCs regulate MSC fate through BMPs, and MSCs influence the mobilization of HSCs by secreting soluble factors.\n129\n The efficacy of co‐transplantation of MSCs and HSCs was mainly reflected in the following three aspects: (a) Co‐transplantation of human MSCs and HSCs into an in utero model of human‐sheep intensified the long‐term engraftment of human cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of the animals.\n130\n Noort et al\n131\n reported that the engrafted cells could be enhanced 3‐4 times when low numbers of HSCs were co‐infused with MSCs. (b) Hematopoiesis reconstitution was promoted significantly.\n132\n Jung et al\n129\n indicated that when HSCs and MSCs were co‐transplanted in micropores of 3D calcium phosphate scaffolds, the HSC‐MSC co‐seeded graft yielded markedly increased vascular number and diameter 4 weeks after ectopic implantation in immunodeficient mice. A significant elevation in the expression of human OCN was also confirmed in the HSC‐MSC group compared with MSCs seeded without HSCs. (c) Human HSCs were promoted to differentiate into B‐lymphocytes, granulocytes and megakaryocyte in vivo,\n132\n illustrating that co‐transplantation could reconstruct B‐cell immunity, which might be related to the recovery of immunoregulation.\n132",

        "Although both autologous and allogeneic BMMSC transplantation are theoretically feasible, based on preclinical animal experiments, immune rejection is an inevitable risk for allogeneic transplantation and should be taken consideration in clinical trials.\n133\n Therefore, all of the ongoing clinical trials have chosen autologous transplantation. The Hospital Clinico Virgen de la Arrixaca in Spain conducted an uncontrolled, open‐label clinical trial in Phase I sponsored by Red de Terapia Celular. In this clinical trial, operator collected autologous BMMSCs from patients approximately 30 days before transplantation and cultured them under controllable manufacturing conditions to expand to the dose range. The BMMSCs were subjected to a course of fucosylation and then injected intravenously into patients with osteoporosis. Four patients enrolled received a single dose of 2 × 106 cells/kg and six patients received a single dose of 5 × 106 cells/kg. After 24 months, bone resorption, formation and metabolism were measured using biochemical indexes, BMD was measured using dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry, and bone structure was evaluated using tissue morphology (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02566655).",
        "In addition to bone marrow‐derived cells, ASCs have also been studied for clinical use because of the wide distribution and availability of adipose tissues. An interventional phase II clinical trial using human ASCs to treat individuals over 50 years old with proximal humeral fractures as a model for osteoporotic fracture has been conducted by the University Hospital in Basel, Switzerland. In this study, ASCs were wrapped around hydroxyapatite microgranules embedded in a fibrin gel to allow cellularized composite graft augmentation. Clinical and/or radiological follow‐up was performed at 6, 9 and 12 months after operation. Functional assessment was performed at 6 weeks, and 6 and 12 months after operation using the Constant score and the Quick DASH score (disabilities of arm, shoulder and hand). However, the trial was terminated and no results were reported (NCT01532076).",
        "Although preclinical experiments using MSCs to treat osteoporosis have been established for years with positive effects and recognized mechanisms, there are still many challenges and hurdles to be faced in the process of clinical transformation, including safety issues, transplant efficiency and standardization of proliferation and the manufacturing processes.",
        "First, the self‐renewal ability of MSCs carries an inherent risk of tumour formation. MSCs are directly involved in tumour progression and metastasis by changing the biological characteristics of cancer cells, regulating immune status and promoting angiogenesis.\n134\n The results of a meta‐analysis of 39 relevant animal experiments by Li et al\n135\n showed that MSC transplantation increased the incidence and quantity of tumour metastasis in an experimental tumour model. To date, there have been at least four clinical trials using MSCs to treat cancer; however, no results have been reported (NCT02008539, NCT02530047, NCT02068794, NCT01983709). Therefore, the relationship between MSC transplantation and tumours remains to be further clarified. The second risk is the potential formation of thrombus after cell transplantation. In a clinical trial of intravenous administration of expanded allogeneic ASCs in refractory rheumatoid arthritis, 141 side effects were reported in 53 patients, including one fatal case of lacunar cerebral infarction.\n136\n Although the team believed that ASCs injection might have induced this infarction, the mechanism of this case remains unclear and requires confirmation. Besides, MSC transplantation might disrupt bone mineral metabolism. The volume of MSCs continues to shrink and become fragmented, accompanied by the release of exosomes, apoptotic bodies and cell fragments, which contain a large number of cytokines and disturb the local microenvironment.\n137\n Kang et al\n138\n and Beak et al\n139\n reported that cell transplantation would contribute to bone mineral metabolism disorder in the short term and then lead to bone formation disorder and increased bone resorption. Thirdly, passaged MSCs often inevitably undergo phenotypic, functional, and more importantly, genetic changes,\n140\n leading to unpredictable safety issues compared with the primary cells. In addition, their osteogenic potential is usually impaired, while their adipogenic potential may be preserved in passaged MSCs, suggesting that only MSCs at early passages would be effective for osteogenic differentiation.\n140",
        "A majority of MSCs were trapped inside the lungs following intravenous infusion, which was termed the pulmonary first‐pass effect.\n141\n After the MSCs were concentrated in the lungs after intravenous injection, 1‐2.7% of the MSCs migrated to each organ, of which less than 1/8 of the MSCs homed to the bone marrow.\n142\n Huang et al\n143\n used an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) to observe the number of MSCs homing at different time slots after transplantation. They found that after intravenous injection, MSCs were initially retained in lungs for around 8‐9 days and then gradually remigrated to the fracture site. It was also reported that intra‐bone marrow injected MSCs could rapidly home to damaged bone tissue; however, the apoptosis rate was high, and less than 3% remained at the fracture site after 5 weeks.\n143\n Fischer et al\n141\n confirmed that the ability of MSCs to pass through pulmonary microvessels was related to their adhesion and deformation ability by transplanting different sizes of MSCs intravenously. Their results proved that infusion via two boluses increased pulmonary MSC passage compared with single bolus administration. The results explained why a single infusion of MSCs benefited transiently, and subsequent infusions with the same donor‐MSCs helped to maintain the beneficial effects.\n144\n Furthermore, following transplantation of primary MSCs that had been cultured for only 24 hours, the homing capacity was reduced to 10%, while after transplantation of 48 hour‐cultured primary MSCs, no cells were detected in the target organs.\n145",
        "First, the performance and immunogenicity of MSCs from different tissue sources are different, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. There is still controversy surrounding which tissue stem cells should be extracted from. Another problem is the standardization of MSC growth and their functional amplification, which is a mandatory objective of cell therapies. However, no unified standardized process has been proposed so far.\n146\n Next, there is no unified standard for the MSC injection volume at present and 1‐5 × 106/kg is commonly used in animal experiments.\n147\n The last issue is that different administrations might lead to different therapeutic effects. Agata et al\n148\n contrasted the safety and efficacy of intra‐bone marrow and intravenous administration of MSCs to treat OVX‐induced osteoporosis. They noticed that none of the mice died after intra‐bone marrow administration, whereas 22% of the mice died after intravenous administration. With reference to efficacy, intra‐bone marrow administration improved BMD by increasing both the bone mineral content and bone thickness, whereas intravenous administration improved BMD by increasing bone mineral content without affecting bone thickness. The results indicated that intra‐bone marrow administration of pure MSCs might be a safer and more effective method to treat osteoporosis.",
        "Recently, growing attention has been focused on extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are secreted by MSCs\n149\n and play a critical role in cell‐cell communication.\n150\n Unlike MSCs, implanted EVs interact with their targets via signal transduction by docking at the plasma membrane of the target cell and/or via releasing the bioactive cargo upon fusion or endocytosis followed by fusing with the delimiting membrane of the endosomal compartment in bone‐remodelling microenvironment.\n149\n, \n151\n In addition to inhibiting the inflammatory response\n152\n and promoting vascularization,\n153\n which are similar to the effects of MSC transplantation, EVs have been found to promote bone formation by repairing the function of impaired MSCs\n150\n and improving the activity of osteoblasts,\n154\n suggesting that EV is a prospective therapeutic target for osteoporosis.\n155\n Li et al\n156\n and Chen et al\n157\n explored the effects of EVs on the osteogenic, proliferation, and migration capabilities of BMMSCs in vitro, and demonstrated that EVs derived from ASCs promoted bone regeneration. Shen et al\n158\n found that EVs fabricated from BMMSCs contained growth factors secreted by MSCs, and co‐culture with EVs in vitro increased the viability of osteoblast cells. Further in vivo experiments confirmed that injection of EVs mitigated OVX‐induced osteoporosis by reducing cell apoptosis and systemic inflammation, but increasing osteoblast numbers. Qi et al\n153\n revealed that EVs stimulated bone regeneration and angiogenesis in critical‐sized calvarial defects in OVX rats and the effect of EVs increased with increasing concentration. Liu et al,\n159\n Zhao et al\n160\n and Zuo et al\n161\n also proved that BMMSC‐derived EVs alleviated osteoporosis progression and bone loss, and elevated mineralized nodule and bone formation. Their data strongly suggested that EVs had an application prospect in the treatment of osteoporosis. Furthermore, Wang et al\n162\n proved that EVs from human exfoliated deciduous teeth could enhance osteogenic differentiation in periodontal ligament stem cells, furnishing new insights into the application of EVs in periodontitis‐induced bone defect therapy.",
        "Moreover, EVs have the following advantages compared with cell transplantation: (a) High security: With no expression of MHC proteins, EVs do not cause immune rejection, cell malignancies, and other problems.\n163\n (b) Convenience: EVs can be stored at −20°C for a long time, making then easy to store and transport.\n164\n (c) Stability: The outer lipid covers proteins, nucleic acids, and other contents to prevent them from being decomposed by body fluids.\n165\n (d) The manufacturing process of EVs is easier to standardize than that of stem cells.\n166\n, \n167\n Although EVs might circumvent many of the problems associated with MSC transplantation and represent a future trend for osteoporosis treatment, the research is still at an early stage. Mechanistic research and clinical trials of stem cell therapy based on MSCs represent important foundations for research into the mechanisms of EVs and their clinical translation.",

        "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a significant global health challenge and ranks as the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide (1). While surgical resection and local ablation continue to serve as the mainstay treatment options for early-stage HCC patients, the utilization of diverse systemic therapies has become indispensable in enhancing prognosis for individuals in intermediate to advanced stages (2, 3). But current therapeutic options are seldom curative and the prognosis of patients with HCC remains grim (2, 3). Therefore, the exploration of innovative and efficient therapeutic strategies holds the utmost importance.",
        "Recently, immunotherapy has opened up the possibility of new scenarios for treating advanced HCC (4). The immune system’s access to the liver is tightly regulated, and the liver’s immunosuppressive environment has evolved to defend against immune attacks (5, 6). As HCC typically expresses identifiable tumor-associated antigens, such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), glypican-3 (GPC3), or cellular-mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-MET) (7), there is a strategic opportunity where treatments could potentially stimulate or augment an anti-tumor immune response through vaccination or targeted therapeutic interventions (8, 9). Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been previously successfully employed in clinical settings for the management of HCC (10). On the contrary, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown significant therapeutic efficacy in patients with hematological malignancies (11, 12); nevertheless, further optimization of the technology is required for the effective and safe therapy of solid tumors including HCC (13, 14). The extensive research efforts by multiple investigators in both preclinical and clinical settings to assess CAR-T therapy against HCC underline a paradigm shift in the treatment (15). This review emphasizes the potential of applying CAR-T cells in HCC therapy, discussing aspects related to their design and delivery, recent therapeutic advancements, encountered challenges, and potential solutions.",
        "The fundamental concept behind CAR-T cell immunotherapy is to combine the strength of a T cell with the targeting accuracy of an antibody to recognize specific tumor antigens (11). CAR-T therapy aims to introduce specific CARs into T cells in a relatively short timeframe (15). Expansion of these engineered T cells leads to the generation of memory and effector lymphocytes with high affinity in vitro (14, 15). Subsequently, these T cells are reinfused into the patient to undergo robust proliferation (14). The engineered CAR provides specificity, while the intracellular signaling domains trigger T cell-mediated cytotoxicity for eliminating cancer cells regardless of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation (16, 17). CAR-T cells have been referred to as ‘living medications’ due to their ability to undergo proliferation and differentiation into durable memory cells, therefore inducing specific and enduring anti-tumor immune responses (11, 17) (\nFigure 1\n).",
        "Schematic illustration of CAR-T cell therapy in HCC. chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy involves the initial extraction of T cells from the patient’s peripheral blood, followed by the introduction of a CAR gene into the T cells using a viral vector. This process results in the production of CAR T cells. After the CAR T cells are multiplied in vitro, they undergo a thorough assessment for cellular quality and are then aseptically filled. The final step involves administering the CAR T cells to the patient, where they are able to selectively bind to molecular targets such as GPC3, AFP, NKG2D, CD133, EpCAM, MUC1, CEA and c-MET.",
        "When viewed structurally, CARs can be divided into four distinctive components (18). There exists the antigen-binding domain and a linker region in the extracellular part of CARs (18). The antigen-binding domain typically derived from a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) commonly found in antibodies, allowing the CAR to attach to the target antigen present on the tumor cells (19, 20). Following this section comes a spacer or hinge region, which is subsequently linked to a transmembrane domain (21). Finally, an intracellular domain is present to convey signals to the CAR-modified cells (22, 23).",
        "This intracellular domain can be further categorized into costimulatory domains and signaling domains (24, 25). Specific regions of CD28, 4-1BB, ICOS, or OX40 are commonly utilized as co-stimulatory domains (24–26). The CD28 co-stimulatory receptor on T cells plays a vital role in transmitting essential signals for continuous signaling, cell growth, and preventing immune exhaustion (27). Meanwhile, 4-1BB and OX40 act as co-stimulatory receptors impacting T cell activation, maturation, and apoptosis induction (28, 29). Overall, the integration of these co-stimulatory domains has proven to enhance the effectiveness of CAR-T cells in terms of cytokine secretion, T cell expansion, proliferation, and differentiation (30, 31). CAR-T cell generations are broadly classified based on the arrangement of their intracellular signaling domains (32). The first generation of CAR consists only of the CD3ζ signaling domain, with the addition of extra co-stimulatory signaling domains in the second generation (33, 34). In the third generation, two co-stimulatory domains are combined (35). Moreover, introducing a single co-stimulatory structural domain, in conjunction with another transgene, can be utilized to amplify cytokine production and thereby strengthen the functionality of CAR-T cells in fourth-generation CAR-T cell therapy (36). Contrasting with previous generations, the fifth generation of CAR-T cells includes an additional intracellular domain (37). Full activation of T cells is exclusively attained when both CARs engage simultaneously with their corresponding target antigens expressed on the cells (14, 18). CAR-T cells will not be activated by normal cells expressing only one of the two target antigens, thus evading elimination (38).",
        "Both clinical and preclinical evidence have highlighted the substantial roles each of these regions plays in the overall functionality of CAR-T cells (39). The design of CARs is instrumental in determining the attributes of the associated CAR-T cells, encompassing elements such as antigen specificity, activation capability, cytotoxicity, proliferation potential, expansion capacity, persistence, and safety profile (40, 41). Therefore, it is imperative to select the optimal CAR format tailored to the specific needs of individual applications.",
        "Compared to conventional antitumor pharmaceuticals, CAR-T cell therapy exhibits distinct characteristics (41). This novel therapeutic approach represents a precision-targeted strategy for the management of neoplastic growths (41). An ideal target antigen for CAR-T cell therapy in cancers should display elevated levels of expression on tumor cells while showing either insignificant or minimal expression on normal cells (42). Key target antigens investigated in preclinical studies and clinical trials encompass Mucin 1, GPC3, AFP, NK group 2D ligand (NKG2DL) and c-MET (\nTable 1\n).",
        "Current targets of CAR-T cell therapy in HCC.",
        "GPC3 is an embryonic glycoprotein that is tethered to the cellular membrane via a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor, which has been demonstrated upregulated expression in various malignancies, notably HCC (43, 44). Being an oncofetal antigen, GPC3 exhibits high expression in over 70% of HCC cases (43). Emerging evidence has revealed that GPC3 exerts remarkably impacts on HCC progression (43). GPC3’s core protein interacts with Frizzled, the Wnt receptor, which results in amplifying Wnt/β-catenin cascade and elevated cell growth in HCC (45, 46). Moreover, GPC3 could be oncogenic activated by zinc-fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) and C-myc, therefore promoting cell proliferation and differentiation in the setting of HCC (47, 48). Remarkably, Dargel and co-workers identified an HLA-A2-restricted peptide (GPC3-367) and employed peptide multimers to isolate GPC3-specific T cells; in this research, primary CD8+ T cells expressing the transgenic T-cell receptor recognizing GPC3 with specificity were identified. These T cells exhibited the capability to eradicate GPC3-expressing hepatoma cells in vitro and hinder the progression of HCC xenograft tumors in mice (49). Therefore, targeting GPC3 may be a promising strategy against HCC.",
        "Existing evidence has mentioned that GPC3 seems to have a stronger connection with the utilization of CAR T cell therapy (50, 51). GPC3-specific CAR-T cells have demonstrated the capability to eradicate GPC3-positive HCC cells in laboratory settings and GPC3-positive HCC tumor xenografts in murine models (52, 53). The synergistic use of sorafenib in conjunction with GPC3-targeted CAR-T cells has also shown effectiveness (54, 55).",
        "To improve therapeutic effectiveness, Sun et al. engineered GPC3-targeted CAR-T cells that overexpressed glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) or acylglycerol kinase (AGK) for the treatment of HCC (56). These engineered CAR-T cells demonstrated targeted and efficient elimination of GPC3-positive tumor cells in vitro, showcasing enhanced antitumor efficacy in comparison to the second-generation CAR-T cells (56). Additionally, the upregulation of GLUT1 or AGK conferred protection to the CAR-T cells against apoptosis following repeated encounters with tumor cells (56). In line with this, novel GPC3-CAR-T cells were engineered to express IL-7 and CCL9 for stimulating the proliferation and facilitating migration (44, 57). Significantly, in a phase I clinical trial, these modified CAR-T cells effectively eradicated the tumor upon intra-tumor administration in a patient with advanced GPC3-positive HCC (57). Zhou et al. engineered bispecific CAR-T cells targeting both fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and GPC3 simultaneously to address tumor diversity in HCC (58). The bispecific CAR-T cells displayed increased efficacy against tumor cells in vitro. Moreover, these bispecific CAR-T cells exhibited enhanced antitumor activity and significantly prolonged the survival of HCC mouse models, which represent a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate HCC recurrence (58).",
        "AFP, a fetal-specific alpha-globulin produced during fetal development and detected in fetal blood and tissues, is also observable in the HCC tumors (59). In light of the fact that CAR-T cells specifically target tumor surface antigens rather than secreted or intracellular ones, Liu et al. engineered AFP-CAR-T cells capable of selectively binding to the AFP158-166 peptide presented by HLA-A02:01 on the surface of tumor cells in vivo (60). AFP-targeted CAR-T cells have demonstrated the capability to significantly inhibit tumor growth both in vivo and vitro (60).",
        "c-MET is a pro-oncogene responsible for encoding the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (61, 62). c-MET can trigger various downstream pathways, including the RAS/MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways, promoting tumor cell proliferation, growth and metastasis in HCC (63, 64). Jiang et al. developed the bispecific CAR-T cells that target both c-Met and programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1) and showed notable cytotoxicity against c-Met+PD-L1+ HCC cells (65). Furthermore, dual-targeted T cells exhibited potent inhibitory effects on tumorigenesis, surpassing the effects observed with single-targeted CAR-T cells (65). Recently, Qin and colleagues designed two MET-specific CARs: CD28ζ and 4-1BB (66). In comparison with MET inhibitors that targeted MET activation, MET-CAR-T cells recognized and eliminated HCC cells based on overall MET expression, with their activity being unrelated to MET signaling pathway activation (66). While MET-CAR.CD28ζ is favored for future advancements, optimizing the CAR construct design and implementing strategies to counteract CAR-T cell exhaustion induced by the tumor microenvironment are essential to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of MET-CAR-T cells (66).",
        "NKG2D serves as a vital activating receptor present on NK cells and NKT cells (67). It recognizes and binds to a range of cell surface glycoproteins known as NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL), which are distantly related to MHC class I molecules (67). These ligands are upregulated in response to malignant transformation, thereby marking “stressed” or “harmful” cells for elimination by NKG2D+ lymphocytes (68, 69). The NKG2DL system offers a sophisticated immune surveillance mechanism that involves multiple layers of regulation to maintain a balance between early detection of stressed cells and prevention of autoimmunity induction (70).",
        "In HCC, NKG2DL was elevated in tumor samples and related to aggressive carcinogenesis (71). Non-viral methods were employed in the generation of NKG2D CAR-T cells, involving the use of electroporation to introduce CAR-carrying piggyBac transposon plasmids, followed by in vitro expansion with K562 artificial antigen-presenting cells (72). This strategy not only preserved the anti-tumor capabilities of NKG2D CAR-T cells in laboratory settings but also led to a decrease in the levels of exhaustion markers typically found in T cells (72). Sun et al. performed research involving the development of NKG2D-BBz CAR-T cells utilizing the CAR derived from the extracellular domain of NKG2D, combining with 4-1BB and CD3ζ (73). These modified CAR-T cells exhibited potent cytotoxicity against HCC cells in laboratory settings and demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in xenograft models (73). The findings highlight the targeted eradication of HCC cells by NKG2D-BBz CAR-T cells in an NKG2DL-dependent manner, laying the groundwork for advancing towards clinical trials involving NKG2DL-positive patients (73).",
        "Although the preliminary findings show promise, several potential drawbacks need to be taken into account. The monitoring of tumors by NKG2D can put significant pressure on their survival (74). Thus, it is not unexpected that certain human tumors release NKG2DL from their outer layer to escape immune attacks, leading to a rise in soluble NKG2DL levels (75). When the soluble NKG2D ligand binds, it can reduce the sensitivity of NKG2D in attacking cells throughout the body and weaken their ability to fight against tumors (76, 77). Moreover, evidence suggests that NKG2D plays a role in tumor formation in cases of inflammation-induced cancers including HCC (78). The impact of NKG2D CAR-T cells on either enhancing anti-tumor activity or promoting tumor-favorable inflammation in such scenarios is awaiting to be established.",
        "Elevated CD133 is a common feature in HCC and is typically associated with an unfavorable prognosis for patients (79). The findings of a phase II clinical trial offered initial evidence that CD133-CAR-T cells exhibited significant anti-tumor effects and posed no significant safety risks in advanced HCC cases (80). The study revealed a median overall survival of 12 months and a median progression-free survival of 6.8 months, showcasing promising results in this advanced-stage cohort (80). Moreover, Yang et al. opted for a non-viral approach to effectively generate CD133-specific CAR-T cells capable of producing PD-1 scFv checkpoint inhibitors using an SB system derived from minicircle vectors, which has demonstrated reduced immunogenicity, lower costs, and enhanced safety in comparison to viral vectors (81). Thereafter, these engineered cells exerted significantly anti-tumor effects on HCC cells and xenograft mouse models, implying that employing an approach incorporating CD133 CAR-T and PD-1 scFv cells may present a viable choice for individuals dealing with advanced HCC and upregulated expression of CD133 (81). CoG133-CAR-T cells demonstrated significant transfection efficiency and displayed dual antigen-binding capabilities targeting CD133 and GPC3 (82). Extended survival and eradication of tumors were noted in HCC xenograft mice treated with CoG133-CAR-T cells, underscoring the significant promise of dual-specificity CAR-T cells (82).",
        "Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM), a transmembrane protein located on the cell surface, has traditionally served as a primary indicator for carcinomas and is commonly employed in cancer diagnostics (83, 84). EpCAM expression related to poor prognosis in patients with advanced HCC (85). At present, EpCAM CAR-T cells are in the developmental stages for cancer therapy, with their potential application in HCC remaining unexplored (86). Multiple clinical trials are currently recruiting participants to assess the effectiveness and the safe profile of EpCAM CAR-T cells in individuals with advanced HCC (NCT02729493), postoperative relapse (NCT03013712), and refractory HCC (NCT05028933).",
        "Mucin 1 (MUC1) is overexpressed in various cancers and contributes to tumorigenesis in HCC (87, 88). At present, an ongoing clinical trial is investigating the use of MUC1 CAR-T cells for the treatment of HCC (NCT02587689). Additionally, increased levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in serum have been identified as prognostic biomarkers in HCC (89). In the HITM-SIR trial, six patients with CEA-positive liver metastases were treated with CEA CAR-T cells and hepatic artery infusions combined with selective internal radiation therapy (90). Notably, there were no cases of severe adverse events observed throughout the trial, additional confirmation of the safety profile of CAR-T therapy was obtained (90, 91).",
        "Typically, CAR-T cells are administered via peripheral infusion, and their ability to migrate to the tumor site is essential for achieving cytolytic effects (92). However, T cells typically do not have the necessary chemokine receptors that play a key role in guiding T cells to tumor sites by interacting with chemokines released by tumor cells (93, 94). Moreover, in HCC tissue, there is a dense fibrotic structure that reduces the expression of chemokines, resulting in a significant decline in the ability of CAR-T cells to migrate and infiltrate the tumor (95). Under conditions of low oxygen levels, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 becomes activated and subsequently upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor, which interacts with receptors on endothelial cells (96). This process triggers the remodeling of the surrounding extracellular matrix and facilitates the development of irregular blood vessels within the tumor (96). These vessels exhibit structural abnormalities, including immature basement membranes, excessive branching, and discontinuous junctions. Such aberrant morphology contributes to increased permeability and suboptimal blood flow, ultimately impairing the transport of immune cells and therapeutic agents, thereby obstructing the penetration and homing of CAR T cells (97). Strategies to improve the trafficking and infiltration capabilities include the development of CAR-T cells with chemokine receptors and CAR-T cells engineered to express heparinase (98). Additionally, local administration of CAR-T cells has shown promising enhancements in the fight against tumors (99, 100) (\nFigure 2\n).",
        "Strategies for overcoming challenges of CAR-T cell therapy.",
        "After CAR-T cells have effectively penetrated into a tumor, they encounter challenges presented by the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) including hypoxia and low levels of nutrition (101, 102). Furthermore, the compact TME encircling HCC consists of various immunosuppressive cells including Treg cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and fibroblasts, which can inhibit effective T cell responses by the secretion of immunosuppressive molecules and activating immune checkpoints (102, 103). For example, Luo et al. utilized a folate-targeted Toll-like receptor 7 agonist (FA-TLR7-1A) to specifically revitalize TAMs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), transforming them from an immunosuppressive state to a pro-inflammatory phenotype, while maintaining the characteristics of other immune cell populations (104). The combination of FA-TLR7-1A with CAR-T cell therapy not only converted TAMs and MDSCs from an M2-like anti-inflammatory phenotype to an M1-like pro-inflammatory phenotype but also enhanced the infiltration and activation of both CAR-T cells and endogenous T cells within solid tumors, which markedly improved the effectiveness of standard CAR-T cell therapy against solid tumors in immunocompetent mice. Moreover, tumor glycosylation also plays a crucial role in inhibiting antitumor immune responses. Tumor glycans can impede the recognition of peptide epitopes by antibodies through steric hindrance (105). Furthermore, they foster an immunosuppressive environment by interacting with lectins present on immune cells (such as SIGLECand MGL) and by releasing galectins that bind to inhibitory molecules (including Galectin-9 and Galectin-3) (106, 107). Additionally, branched N-glycans can support interactions between immune checkpoints (like PD-1/PD-L1), thus increasing the activation threshold for T cell receptors (108). Therefore, it is important to explore gene editing targeting immune checkpoints on CAR-T cells, along with the use of targeted drugs to counteract the immunosuppressive TME and enhance metabolism programming, which could reduce the growth of HCC by improving cytotoxic T cell responses (32, 109, 110). Moreover, numerous strategies such as combining CAR-T therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) or other immunostimulatory therapies, as well as engineering CAR-T cells to resist the immunosuppressive effects of cytokines have also been implemented to improve CAR-T therapy responses within TME (111, 112).",
        "Slight modifications in CAR design have been found to have significant impacts, not just on durability but also on safety (113). The infusion of CAR-T cells often leads to notable adverse events, such as off-target toxicity, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and neurotoxicity (114, 115). Genome editing is increasingly contributing to enhancing the safety of CAR-T cells (32). TALENs and CRISPR–Cas nucleases have been utilized to target the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene in CAR-T cells, aiming to inhibit GM-CSF secretion upon CAR-T cell activation, thereby potentially averting the activation of monocytes or macrophages, and subsequently reducing the risk of CRS (116, 117). Furthermore, structural alterations have shown promise in decreasing the toxicity of CAR-T cells while preserving their effectiveness in eradicating tumors (118).",
        "CAR-T cells have emerged as a potentially revolutionary new strategy for the cancer treatment and have the potential to become a cornerstone of clinical management of HCC in the future. Despite the substantial advancements showcased by CAR-T cell therapy, there is still a considerable path ahead in CAR-T research to develop a practical treatment for HCC. To optimize CAR-T cell therapy in the future, further advancements should focus on enhancing CAR-T cell designs specific to HCC and reducing systematic toxicity. Sustained research endeavors focused on elucidating molecular mechanisms, refining treatment protocols, and overcoming therapeutic constraints are essential for driving the field forward toward achieving significant clinical results and ultimately enhancing the prognosis for patients with HCC.",

        "Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T cell) therapy is a new cell immunotherapy technique that incorporates synthetic receptors into T cells that recognize and kill tumor cells with a cognate targeting ligand (1, 2). CAR-T cell therapy has demonstrated unprecedented response rates in patients with B cell lymphoma since the first approval of CD19-targeted CAR-T cells in the USA (1, 3–5). However, along with the remarkable achievements of CAR-T cell therapy, many systemic toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, have also been frequently reported (2, 6–8). Additionally, the complex manufacturing process of CAR-T cells limits the broader applications of this therapeutic method as a standard clinical treatment (2, 9–11). Therefore, there is an exigent need to develop a new paradigm of CAR-T cells to overcome these barriers and allow this therapeutic method to benefit more patients. To simplify the complex manufacturing process of CAR-T cells, universal allogeneic CAR-T cells from healthy persons have been tested in clinical trials (12–15). Universal CAR-T cells can be off-the-shelf and then infused into patients like usual medicines, without needing to wait for the isolation of autologous T cells from patients (12, 16); however, last year’s death case during the clinical trial of UCARTCS1A from Cellectis raised safety concerns about allogeneic CAR-T cells. The FDA also recently halted all clinical trials on universal CAR-T cells from Allogene due to safety concerns (17). Thus, we need new strategies to overcome the associated toxicity and simplify the manufacturing process of current CAR-T cell therapy. In-vivo CAR-T cells induced by nanocarriers loaded with CAR genes and gene-editing tools have shown promising effects for regressing leukemia (18–20). The in-situ programming of autologous CAR-T cells can enhance the targeted killing of tumor cells and reduce systemic toxicity such as CRS and neurotoxicity. Additionally, the nanocarriers can be easily manufactured in a standardized method (21) In-vivo induced CAR-T cells provide a potential solution to overcome the barriers of current CAR-T cell therapy. Thus, here, we review CAR structure design, gene-editing tools, and gene delivery systems and the future trend of immune cell therapy.",
        "The structure of the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) has a modular design consisting of an antigen-binding domain, a hinge, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular signaling domain (Figure 1A). The antigen-binding domain is usually a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) molecule derived from a monoclonal antibody that can bind to antigens on the surface of malignant cancer cells (4, 22–24). The transmembrane domain is responsible for anchoring the CAR onto the T cell membrane. The intracellular signaling domain generally contains a T cell activation domain derived from the CD3ζ chain of the T cell receptor as well as co-stimulatory domains often comprised of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif containing regions of CD28 or 4-1BB (also known as CD137 and TNFRSF9) (25–29). Variations in each component of the CAR structure enable fine-tuning of the functionality and antitumor activity of the resultant CAR-T cell product. Various CAR structures have been designed to improve the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy. Once the designed CAR genes are integrated into T cells, the scFv on the surface of T cells specifically recognizes tumor-associated antigens and binds CAR-T cells with tumor cells. After that, the intracellular signal domains of CAR-T cells are activated and cause CAR-T cells to proliferate and secrete cytokines that kill tumor cells (30–32).",
        "(A) The basic structure of a CAR: extracellular domain, transmembrane domain, and intracellular domain. (B) The development of the five generations of CARs. The first generation only contained the CD3ζ chain functional energy domain9; the second generation contained CD3ζ+ a costimulatory molecular domain (CD28, 4-1BB, etc.); the third generation contained CD3ζ and two costimulatory molecular domains; the fourth generation included suicide gene editing, immune factor modification, and other integrated and refined regulatory tools; the fifth generation included simultaneous activation of TCR, costimulatory domain, and cytokine triple signaling.",
        "There have been five generations of CAR structures since the first clinical application of CAR-T cells by Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania and hematologist David Porter at the Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia in 2011 (33–35). The first-generation CAR contained an intracellular stimulation region and an extracellular scFv. This generation of CAR-T cells could not continuously proliferate due to the lack of costimulatory molecules (Figure 1B) (34). The second-generation CAR added a costimulatory molecule, such as CD28, or 4-1BB (CD137) to enhance the proliferation and reduce the toxicity of CAR-T cells (36). Yescarta™ (Tisagenlecleucel) and Kymriah™ (axicabtagene ciloleucel) are second-generation CAR-T cells that contain CD28 and 4-1BB, respectively (36). The third-generation CAR includes two costimulatory molecules, such as CD27, CD28, tumor necrosis factor superfamily 4 (OX40, also known as CD134), CD137 (4-1BB), or CD244 (37, 38). The fourth-generation CAR is called TRUCKs (T cells redirected for antigen-unrestricted cytokine-initiated killing), which combines the direct antitumor capacities of CAR-T cells with the immune modulating function of the delivered cytokine (34, 39). TRUCKs have entered early-phase clinical trials using a panel of cytokines, including IL-7, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-23, and their combinations. The fifth generation integrates an additional membrane receptor that controls the activation of CAR-T cells in an antigen-dependent manner (38, 40).",
        "In addition to adding new functional molecules into the CAR structure, many studies have chosen alternative tumor-targeted sites for new CAR structures. CD30 shows very strong expression on malignant cells in Hodgkin’s lymphoma, rather than on healthy lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). CD30 CAR-T cell therapy has shown superior results in the treatment of CD30+ malignant tumors, while healthy activated lymphocytes and HSPC were unaffected (41). CD20 is a 33–37-kDa non-glycosylated transmembrane phosphoprotein that helps develop and differentiate B cells (42). CD20 is highly expressed in late pre-B cells and mature B cells, but it is not expressed on the surface of HSPCs (43). CD20 CAR T-cell therapy which has shown promise in the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma is now being considered for patients with relapsed or refractory CD20-positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Lym-1 targets the conformational epitopes of human leukocyte antigen D-associated antigens (HLA-DRs) on the surface of human B-cell lymphoma. The binding affinity of Lym-1 with malignant B cells is higher than that of normal B cells (44). Lym-1 CAR-T cells have exhibited potent antitumor effects against B-cell lymphoma. Some alternative targeting sites combine with CD19 to form dual-target CAR T cells. For example, CD37 combined with CD19 was incorporated into one CAR to generate a dual-specific CAR T cell capable of recognizing CD19 and CD37 alone or together (45). CD79b is also a complementary targeting site for CD19. CD19 and CD79 dual-specific CAR-T cells prevented the escape of B-cell lymphoma from a single CD19 CAR-T cell (46, 47). Some alternative targeting sites have co-targeting functions that act on tumor cells and tumor microenvironments. For instance, CD123 was expressed in both Hodgkin lymphoma cells and tumor-associated macrophages so that anti-CD123 CAR-T cells could co-target these two kinds of cells and kill them simultaneously (48). The CAR structure is continually evolving to improve the efficacy of current CAR-T cell therapy (32, 49).",
        "Five CAR-T cell products have been approved by the FDA from 2017 to 2021, as listed in Table 1. KYMRIAH™ (Tisagenlecleucel) is the first approved CAR-T cell therapy for adult patients with certain types of B-cell lymphoma (50). Three approved CAR-T cell products, YESCARTA™ (Axicabtagene ciloleucel), TECARTUS™ (brexucabtagene autoleucel), and BREYANZI® (lisocabtagene maraleucel), are also approved for the treatment of B cell lymphoma (51–53). The fifth CAR-T cell product, ABECMA® (idecabtagene vicleucel), is used for multiple myeloma therapy (54). Beyond the five approved CAR-T cell products, a large pipeline of CAR-T cells is being studied in clinical trials (55–57), but current CAR-T therapy has several barriers, such as associated toxicity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, and complex manufacturing processes, which hamper the more widespread implementation of CAR-T therapy (58–60).",
        "An overview of currently approved CAR-T products.",
        "The major toxicities associated with current CAR-T therapy include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and on-target/off-tumor toxicity (61–63). CRS is caused by the generation of massive inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, and TNFα, after CAR-T cell treatment. CRS often causes fever, hypotension, hypoxia, organ dysfunction, and even life-threatening adverse reactions (8, 64, 65). The occurrence of severe or life-threatening CRS can reach 25%. ICANS is another common toxicity associated with CAR-T cell therapy and is characterized by neurological abnormalities with aftereffects, usually within 1 week of CAT-cell treatment. The frequent adverse effects caused by ICANS include toxic encephalopathy with aphasia, confusion, and word-finding difficulty (66–68). On-target/off-tumor toxicity is due to the non-special expression of targeting proteins on both normal and malignant cells (69, 70). For instance, when administrating CD19 CAR-T cell in patients with malignant B cells, the on-target/off-tumor effect will lead to B cell aplasia and result in hypogammaglobulinemia due to the eradication of CD19+ B cell progenitors by CD19 CAR T cells (71, 72).",
        "The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (MVT) inhibits the activation of CAR-T cells and accelerates the exhaustion of T cells (70, 73). Unfavorable factors in immunosuppressive MVT include hypoxia, various immunosuppressive cells, and the sustained expression of co-inhibitory receptors (74, 75). Hypoxia is defined as a shortage of oxygen in the tumor MVT. Immunosuppressive cells in the tumor MVT contain regulatory T cells (Tregs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (74, 76).",
        "The current manufacturing process of CAR-T cells is a highly complex endeavor, including T cell collection, genetic modification and expansion, and infusion back into patients (77, 78). These multistep technologies and logistics are rife with risks (10). Additionally, the long-term and individualized manufacturing processes pose great challenges for building up standard operating procedures (79). The costly and technology-intensive manufacturing processes of current CAR-T cells make them out of reach for many cancer patients in need of this novel therapy.",
        "The gene-editing tools frequently applied to CAR-T cell therapy include zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) technology (80–82). ZFN is the first broadly applied gene-editing tool that includes zinc fingers, a large multimeric protein, wherein each individual finger targets three to four base-pair sequences within genomic DNA (83, 84). Multimeric zinc finger proteins are able to link with the FokI endonuclease to create a ZFN that can cleave site-specific double-stranded DNA and lead to homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (85). ZFN can achieve effective and specific gene-editing, but it is time-consuming to optimize the targeting protein molecules. TALEN are composed of several TAL units that can recognize base pairs of DNA and link to an endonuclease to generate the site-specific cleavage of DNAs (86, 87). TALEN are more economical than ZFN but still require a long time to optimize the system. CRISPR-Cas9 technology is the most popular gene-editing tool due to its simplicity and efficiency. The CRISPR-Cas9 complex was initially identified as an immune system for cleaving foreign viral DNA in Streptococcus pyogenes (88). These CRISPR complexes are first transcribed into RNAs (crRNAs), including bacterial CRISPR sequences, viral sequences (protospacers), and intervening sequences (PAMs) (89). These crRNAs are then complexed with the Cas endonuclease. Once the Cas–crRNA complex recognizes a homologous protospacer and PAM sequence, the Cas endonuclease cleaves the double-stranded DNA, followed by an automatic DNA repair process (88). A short-guide RNA (sgRNA) was introduced into the CRISPR-Cas9 system as the crRNA, making CRISPR-Cas9 an efficient, specific, and simple gene-editing tool (90). The development of gene-editing technology has allowed the precise surgical gene-editing of CAR-T cells to generate exhaustion-resistant T cells via removing the PD1 of T cells (91). CRISPR-Cas9 was also used to deplete endogenous antigens, such as CD33 and CD7, in normal cells to reduce the on-target off/tumor toxicity of redirected T cells (92, 93). The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been used in many CAR-T clinical trials involving more than twenty-one target antigens (Figure 2) (94–97). CD19 and BCMA account for nearly one-half of the CAR-T clinical trials on these target antigens. To use the CRISPR-Cas9 system more widely to edit CAR-T cells, efficient delivery methods must be developed.",
        "Target antigens of CAR-T cell therapy using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology registered in ClinicalTrials.gov until June 2021. The data only include clinical trials that are registered in USA.",
        "Plenty of delivery systems have been used to deliver gene therapy products including the gene-editing tools and CAR genes (Figure 3). Viral vectors have the highest transfection efficiency and have been widely used to deliver genes in various applications (96), but they suffer from the immunogenicity and cellular toxicity. Adenovirus-associated viruses (AVV) have a lower risk of toxicity than other viral vectors such as lentivirus, and adenovirus due to insertional mutagenesis (98). However, the AAV vector has a smaller packaging size (~5.0 kb) than other viral vectors (99). Non-viral delivery systems for gene delivery can be classified into either physical or chemical techniques. Physical techniques include electroporation, needle injection, laser irradiation, and gene guns. Electroporation is one of the most widespread application methods, which induces pore formation on cell membranes and the transient permeability of genes using electric pulses (100–102). Physical techniques have attractive effects on gene delivery due to their low immunogenicity, but they cannot target internal organs. Chemical techniques that mainly use nano-delivery systems include cationic lipids or polymer-based nanoparticles, golden nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles and quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, exosomes, ferritin, and cell membranes. Lipid-based nanoparticles are one of the most attractive non-viral vectors for gene delivery as several formulations of these carriers have been approved to use in the clinic (103–105). Especially, lipid-based nanoparticles have recently been successfully used to deliver SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines (106). Lipid nanoparticles have also been used to deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 system to achieve in-vivo genome editing at clinically relevant levels (107, 108). Polymer-based nanoparticles are another system suitable for gene delivery applications. Positively charged polymers can form stable polyplexes with genes that disrupt cell membranes and enable endosomal escape (109, 110). The limitation of polymer-based nanoparticles is their toxicity and immunogenicity caused by the interaction of their positively charged surfaces with negatively charged cell membranes and proteins in blood circulation (111, 112). Exosomes are naturally secreted extracellular vesicles with nanometer sizes that are being extensively investigated as gene delivery vectors due to their natural biocompatibility and minimal immune clearance (113, 114); however, more efforts are required to overcome the difficulties in production, isolation, and purification (115). Cell membranes derived from platelets and red blood cells are biomimetic vectors used for gene delivery that have natural biocompatibility and targeting, but their transfection efficiencies need to be improved (116–118). Each of the other chemical nano-vectors has unique characteristics that determine their effects on gene delivery. Some have shown potential efficiency for the treatment of many diseases, but optimal delivery systems are still unrealized for clinical use.",

The total number of papers is 18,968 obtained from PubMed, and Microsoft Excel was used to obtain the pie graph. The keywords are the name of vectors and gene delivery or CAR gene.",
        "The current manufacturing process of CAR-T cells requires dedicated equipment and significant technical expertise and is also labor-intensive and time-consuming. (10, 119, 120). It limits the broader worldwide applications of this technology and drives up the price of CAR-therapy, making it out of reach of many patients (121). To simplify the production process, universal CAR-T cells from allogeneic healthy persons were tested in clinical trials, but, the FDA recently halted all clinical trials on the universal CAR-T cells from Allogene due to safety concerns of allogeneic CAR-T cells. There is an urgent need to develop a safe and simple production process for CAR-T cells. In-vivo programming of CAR-T cells by nanoparticles is an elegant and novel approach to simplify and standardize the complex manufacturing process of ex-vivo CAR-T cells (122). Additionally, the in-situ induction of CAR-T cells effectively reduces the systemic toxicity of CRS and ICANS. Recently, in-vivo induced CAR-T cells were accomplished through the nano-delivery of CAR structures or gene-editing tools by the team of Matthias Stephan from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, USA) (18, 20). They accomplished the stable and transient expression of targeting CAR protein in T cells via the infusion of nanoparticles loaded with CAR-DNA and CAR-mRNA, respectively. In these two works, the core of the nano-delivery systems was composed of a cationic polymer, poly(β-amino ester), assembled with a second-generation CAR structure targeted to CD19. The exterior of the nano-delivery system was composed of polyglutamic acid (PGA) conjugated with an anti-CD3 antibody. The polymer nanoparticles carrying CD19-specific CAR genes quickly and specifically edited T-cells in vivo and brought about comparable antitumor efficacies to conventional laboratory-manufactured CAR T-cells without inducing systemic toxicity. In addition to the polymer nanoparticles, viral vectors such as lentiviruses and AAV have also been tested for the in-vivo generation of CAR-T cells. Christian J. Buchholz and his colleagues first reported that lentiviruses encapsulated with a second-generation anti-CD19 CAR gene induced in-situ CAR T cells in immunodeficient NOD-scid-IL2Rcnull (NSG) mice and showed antitumor activity (123, 124). They also exhibited cytokine release syndrome that is notorious in clinical practice. In their study, CAR-positive NK and NKT cells were unexpectedly detected, which were likely caused by the non-specificity of the lentiviral vector. To overcome the non-specificity of the viral vector, Samuel K Lai et al. developed a bispecific binder to redirect the lentiviral vector to T cells for the in-vivo specific engineering of CAR-T cells (125). They observed the antitumor activity from the in-vivo CAR-T cells engineered by lentivirus, but a relatively low number of CAR-expressing T cells. They considered this to be proof of a valuable and unverified theory of the superior performance and self-renewal capacity of in-vivo CAR-T cells compared with that of ex-vivo CAR-T cells. However, the toxicity of the in-vivo CAR-T cells engineered by the bispecific binder-redirected lentivirus was not included in this work. Among the viral vectors, AVV has a lower risk of toxicity. Xilin Wu et al. recently reported that AAV encoding a third-generation CAR gene could sufficiently reprogram immune effector cells to generate in-vivo CAR T cells (126). In this work, they showed a strong proof of concept of AAV-induced in-vivo CAR-T cells, but the authors were concerned about the non-specificity of the AAV carrying the CAR gene. Except for the non-specificity of the viral vector, a universal safety concern of viral vectors is the random insertion of genes in the chromosol. Precise and rapid gene editor tools such as CRISPR have been widely used to generate ex-vivo CAR-T cells. There are many studies on in-vivo gene-editing using CRISPR, but there are still no reports on the application of CRISPR to generate in-vivo CAR-T cells. The future applications of combing gene-editing tools and CAR genes will accelerate the clinical adoption of in-vivo CAR-T cells.",
        "The nano-delivery of designed CAR-structures and gene-editing tools can induce the in-vivo formation of CAR-T cells with multiple functions to overcome the barriers of current CAR-T cells, such as associated CRS and ICANS toxicities, immunosuppressive microenvironment, and complex manufacturing processes (Figure 4). Systemic toxicities can be reduced through tumor in-situ editing and the expansion of T cells (18, 62). The incorporation of special cytokine genes into a CAR structure enables CAR-T cells to secrete cytokines, flushing the immunosuppressive microenvironment and making it suitable for the survival and proliferation of T cells (127–129). Loading gene-editing tools with CAR structures into nanoparticles can knock out the genes of immune checkpoint blockades to reverse T-cell exhaustion (130–132). More importantly, this approach resolves the difficulty of process standardization and scale-up of the manufacture of ex-vivo CAR-T cells (133). The final gene-editor nanoparticles can be conveniently produced, stored, and delivered as usual medicines (Figure 5). These studies are just the beginning of the period of in-vivo induced CAR-T cells. Their clinical applications still require more efforts to monitor the in-vivo editing and expansion status of T-cells.",

In-vivo induced CAR T cells use nanotechnology to encapsulate CAR-expressing plasmids into nano-delivery systems including polymer nanoparticles and viral vectors such as lentivirus and AAV, which are then targeted to tumor regions in-vivo to edit T cells in-situ at tumor sites to kill tumors.",

However, current CAR-T cell therapy also has some barriers that need to be overcome such as CRS and ICANS toxicity and expensive and complex manufacturing procedures. The in-vivo induced CAR-T cells by nanoparticles loaded with CAR genes and gene-editing tools have shown potential breakthroughs to overcome the abovementioned barriers of current CAR-T cell therapy. Although very few studies have reported nanoparticle-induced in-vivo CAR-T cells, robust preclinical data have predicted the future of cellular therapy through nano-delivery approaches. The field of in-vivo induced CAR-T cell therapy is still in its infancy with many challenges for the translation of this approach into clinical practice. A systematic summary of the nano-delivery systems for inducing in-vivo CAR-T cells can guide the design of the nanoparticles and their cargo to optimize their efficacy (134–136). In summary, in-vivo induced CAR-T cells are expected to replace current CAR-T cell therapy and become the standard immune-cell therapy for cancers.",

        "Stem cell therapy is considered as a powerful tool for various clinical applications. Human stem cells can be obtained from different tissues in adults during their lifetime, including bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) [1], umbilical cord stem cells (UCSCs), adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), skeletal stem cells, and other types, such as dental pulp, skin, and placenta [2,3,4,5,6,7]. Some studies have defined the stem cells from bone marrow as standard mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) defines the minimal criteria of mesenchymal stem cells [8]. MSCs have been demonstrated to differentiate into different cell lineages which regulate the immune system and induce anti-inflammation [9]. During treatment, the infused MSCs can bring effects on injured or inflammation sites. MSCs expressed far-distance effects by secreted bioactive factors. Stem cell therapy works as a medicine. MSCs are also accepted the name of mesenchymal stromal cells since the effects of MSCs are not multipotency. Compared to embryonic stem cells, MSCs can be obtained with invasive or minimally invasive procedures. The source of stem cells is abundance in adipose tissues, but limited in bone marrow (approximately 0.42%). However, the finding of adult stem cells might solve the ethical issues that are caused by using embryonic stem cell. Thus, MSCs are attractive cell types in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine [10]. Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) is another important stem cell type, which has been investigated in 2018 by Charles K.F Chan et al. SSCs isolated from fetal and adult bone can exhibit self-renewing and multipotent differentiation ability as other types of stem cell [2]. Comparative studies in BMSCs, UCSCs, and ADSCs suggested that they share common phenotype among 22 cell surface markers and differentiation potential; however, they noticeably differ in global gene expression patterns, proliferation rate, and clinical outcome [11,12]. Based on reported publications, Loubna Mazini et al. pointed that ADSCs are safer and more efficient in auto-immune diseases, UCSCs are mostly used in hematopoietic diseases, whereas BMSCs can be applied in immunosuppressive activity, hematopoietic self-renewal, and cancers [10]. The authors also reported that ADSCs were safe and efficient for systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, scleroderma, and Crohn’s diseases with no serious adverse effects being reported for short or long-time follow-up. BMSCs and UCSCs were limited for the small sample size and short-term follow-up of autoimmune disease’s treatment. Besides, the infusion of BMSCs was successful in improving the overall survival in most hematopoietic engraftment patients without any side-effects. Similar results were also reported with UCSCs after HSCs transplantation. BMSCs have been most commonly used among other stem cells; however, BMSCs characteristics, such as their differentiation potential, quantity, and lifespan, reduced with the age of the donors [10].",
        "BMSCs are widely used in clinical applications. Friedenstein et al. first isolated adult non-hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow and transplant into patients [13]. Over a decade, BMSCs applications have been rapidly increasing. There are 5185 studies on “stem cells”, 1102 studies on “bone marrow stem cells”, and 759 studies on “mesenchymal stem cells” were registered in U.S National Library of Medicine database, according to clinicaltrials.gov (June 2019). Among “bone marrow stem cells” studies, most research has been completed phase I (safety) and phase II (efficacy) by using both allogeneic and autologous BMSCs. Interestingly, there are 95 studies on phase III and 20 studies on phase IV, which indicates the high potency of BMSCs in clinical uses compare to other stem cell types. Table 1 summarizes the number of trials. There are numerous completed trials conducted worldwide, however, mostly in North America with 630 studies (57.2%), followed by Europe 187 studies (16.9%) and the Middle East and East Asian countries (Figure 1). BMSCs are potential in the treatment of various diseases, consisting of muscle, bone and cartilage diseases, blood-related diseases, behavioral, and mental disorders, immune system diseases, nervous system diseases, viral/infective diseases, cancers, wounds, and injuries (available online in https://clinicals.gov). The phase III/IV trials were completed in the cardiovascular diseases, acute leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus.",
        "Studies on BMSCs application provided promising results in many diseases. However, some studies showed varying outcomes, which might be caused by donor variability, cell preparation processes, and lack of standardization prior to transplantation [15]. The number of stem cells is limited in bone marrow (0.42%) when compared to adipose tissue and umbilical cord, thus the expansion and cultivation of BMSCs are required to obtain an efficient number of cells for treatment [16]. However, the expansion process highly contributes to genetic instability, senescence, and transformation issues [9]. In general, in-vitro expansion cells reduce the genetic stability of native BMSCs [9,17]. In vitro expansion reduces DNA polymerase and repair capacity, thus resulting in DNA damage accumulation [9]. Yi et al. developed and optimized GMP compatible culture protocol, which is suitable for producing BMSCs for clinical uses. Clinical-grade BMSCs are stable in terms of genomic integrity [18]. Even that, manufacturing systems hardly meet a standard requirement because of the differences between donors, harvesting methods, devices, and cultivation conditions [19].",
        "The processes of harvesting BMSCs are invasive when compared to adipose stem cells. The donors often receive anesthesia during the procedure, resulting in serious risks (stiff or sore and tired) [20,21]. The recover capacity varies from several days to weeks. After transplantation, medications stimulate the mobilization of stem cells into the bloodstream [22]. However, medication can cause bone and muscle aches, headaches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and sleepless in patients. In fact, the massive number of donor cells die within hours or days after transplantation [23]. Steroids, interferon γ and in-vivo depletion of NK cells weaken the immune system, thus reducing the rejection of the donor cells and interaction donor’s immune cells with the recipient’s healthy cells. Besides, gene editing was also been exploited to avoid the unwanted responses of the immune system [24,25]. Autologous BMSCs transplantation causes no risk that is related to the immune system, graft failure, and treatment-related mortality, where all stem cells will be transplanted back to each patient, whereas allogeneic BMSCs transplantation is involved in the development of skin rash, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hepatitis. However, autologous transplants could result in increased of risk for tumor formation. Autologous BMSCs transplantation is usually preferred for young patients with normal conditions in an effort to reduce the risk for toxicity and graft-versus-host disease that is associated with allogeneic therapy. The allogenic BMSCs therapy is more effectively and commonly treatment in elderly patients, ≥65 years of age who have decrease in response of immune system [26].",
        "In conclusion, the current literature provides separately and inadequacy on BMSCs processing, transplantation methods, and clinical applications. Therefore, this manuscript has summarized the understanding of the research and clinical uses of BMSCs for five years (2014–2019) by searching related keywords in PubMed, google scholar, Elsevier, MDPI database, except for some major references. This manuscript showed the updated information of BMSCs on characteristics, isolation, expansion culture, differentiation potential, and application.",
        "Bone marrow stem cells are known as non-hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that are located in the medullary stroma of bone marrow. BMSCs firstly discovered by Friedenstein et al. in 1976 and named as clonogenic fibroblast precursor cells (CFU-F) [28]. BMSCs have been used for tissue engineering and regenerative medicines [29]. However, BMSCs represent very low in bone marrow tissue, which ranges from 1/10,000 to 1/100,000. During standard culture, BMSCs can amplify 500-fold higher in 50 passages [30]. BMSCs population are heterogeneous [31]. The BMSCs’s characteristics are highly associated with the ages and/or pathological conditions of the donors [32]. The number of BMSCs and their differentiation ability decrease by aging, which is the result of DNA modification and transcriptional changes. Adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic differentiation capacity of murine BMSCs were decreased by the age of donor animals. Supported to the impact of aging, Olivia et al. showed old BMSCs suffered from reduced chondrogenic, adipogenic potential and impaired expansion properties [33]. Those findings indicated the donor’s age factor in cell-based therapies for older patients. Remarkably, BMSCs from old mice were much higher in terms of the presence of certain cellular senescence markers, such as DNA double-strand break marker γ-H2AX and DNA damage checkpoint response mediator 53BP1 than from young mice. Additionally, young BMSCs can increase the osteogenic activities and migration in mice. Transplantation young BMSCs can also extend life span when compared to non-transplantation and old BMSCs transplantation group [34]. Similarly, Stolzing et al. had shown age-related changes in BMSCs, consisting of stem cell number, marker phenotype, proliferation, differentiation potential, senescence and apoptosis induction, and stress level markers [35]. The authors reported the lower number of adherent cells being isolated from bone marrow, increase senescence and apoptosis marked by β-galactosidase positive cells, p53 and p21 expression during cultivation, higher ROS level in “aged” BMSCs when compared to “young” MSCs. Stem cells that were isolated from elders had a low rate of proliferation and differentiation ability into osteoblasts, whereas they increase the expression of apoptosis markers and SA-β-gal positive cells (an indicator of the senescence cells) [31]. The potential of transmitting diseases from the donor to recipient should be carefully considered, such as pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites), congenital disorders, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies [36,37]. Interestingly, these transmittable diseases tend to increase in prevalence with increasing donor age. Viruses like HIV type I and II, hepatitis B, C, CMV, leukemia-associated human T-lymphotropic virus I and II are most frequent in blood and stem cell products [37]. However, the risk of transmission of these viruses is quite low by current screening methods. Vaccination with live vaccines should be limited during the last two weeks of donation. Theoretically, all of the congenital diseases originating from bone marrow cells could be transmittable and should be considered as contraindications for stem cell donation. A patient died after receiving bone marrow transplantation from a donor with Gaucher’s disease [38]. While considering the immunodeficiency of recipient after conditioning, the malignant cells might engraft or metastasize leading to disease in recipient. Thus, clearly, the systematic evaluation of donor status becomes a necessity and mandatory, especially in elder donors.",
        "BMSCs secrete a variety of endocrine factors, which related to fibrosis, proliferation, apoptosis, chemotaxis, immunomodulatory, and angiogenesis processes in damaged tissues. By those effects, BMSCs can stimulate the recovery of the damaged area, the response of the immune system and protect other cells from apoptosis [31]. Table 2 summarizes the list of endocrine factors.",
        "Literature data on the effects of cell culture procedures, individual donors, and clinical conditions are still scarce. Recently, a study has shown significant increase the expression of proteins that are associated with angiogenic signaling pathways under ischemic conditions [39]. Similarly, Salwa et al. have just reported the impact of isolation and culture conditions on the stemness and differentiation potential of BMSCs [40]. The authors investigated cells that were expanded in human serum and FGF2 condition expressed higher osteogenic markers; cell expanded in lysate plasma showed significant upregulation of IL-1α and IL-1β expression. Lysate plasma condition enhanced more stem-like phenotype, delayed differentiation, and changed the inflammatory gene expressions. Moreover, allogeneic HSCs located in bone marrow often cause graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) when the donor’s immune cells attack the healthy cell in patients [41]. The secreted factors and functional of BMSCs are altered, due to the donor’s health, age, and exposure to environmental stresses [42].",
        "An important characteristic of MSCs is the immunoregulatory capacity and elicit immunosuppressive effects. DeMiguel et al. showed these effects in a number of situations, including decreased expression of class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC-II) and costimulatory molecules via direct cell-to-cell interaction and soluble factor secretion. MSCs are capable of inhibiting the cell proliferation of T cells, B-cells, natural killer cells (NK), and dendritic cells. Besides, MSCs can block cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity of T can NK cells, B cell maturation, dendritic cells maturation, and activation, as well as antigen production. Thus, it is clear that MSCs exhibit their immunomodulation activities [43].",
        "In general, MSCs can be obtained by a different method of isolation, cultivation, and characterization, thus BMSCs may vary the expression of cell surface markers. ISCT released the gold standards of BMSCs to classify them among other bone marrow cells [8]. Undifferentiated BMSCs, as well as other MSCs, which are plastic adherent cells, show positive expression of CD105, CD73, CD90, and lack the expression of CD45, CD34, CD14 and CD11b, CD79α, and CD19 at least in the standard culture. Currently, the STRO-1 marker, which is not involved in ISCT criteria, is a defined marker for mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow. STRO-1 highly expresses in fresh and young BMSCs and reduces during expansion culture, thus positive STRO-1 BMSCs are thought to be suitable for clinical application [29]. The higher expression of CD271 and PDGFRα is associated with the skeletal differentiation capacity of BMSCs.",
        "Besides the expression of surface markers, BMSCs can be characterized by self-renewability and multi-lineage differentiation capacity. In vitro, BMSCs can differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondroblasts, neural, myocyte, and epithelial cells by the supplementation of stimulating factors to the cultures. However, the potential for adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondroblasts differentiation of BMSCs subpopulations should be fully characterized [29,44]. The culture process of BMSCs causes heterogeneity in differentiation potential. Additionally, antibiotics and serum that are added in the culture medium can affect the phenotype and differentiation potential of BMSCs [29].",
        "It is clear that both unfractionated bone marrow or specific subpopulation of mesenchymal stem cells can be applied in stem cell therapy [65,66,67,68]. The isolation of BMSCs has been developed and used to characterize mesenchymal stem cells in mouse, rabbit, dog, pig, rat, and human [69,70,71,72,73,74]. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells, which localized together in the bone marrow, are most commonly used in clinical application. The isolation and enrichment strategies and characterization of BMSCs are based on their biological characteristics, which consist of plastic-adhesion, surface markers expression, and multiple lineage differentiation capacities [72,75,76]. Traditionally, BMSCs will be collected by specific bone marrow aspiration and selected as plastic adhesion cells in vitro. This method is simple and convenient when compared to other stem cells; for instance, adipose stem cell isolation requires enzymes to digest adipose tissues. However, it is not enough to distinguish between BMSCs and other bone marrow subpopulations, such as endothelial cells, pericyte, leukocyte, and hematopoietic stem cells [16]. Thus, other isolation methods have been accessed including a density gradient centrifugation method, named as Ficoll method [77], as well as advanced cell sorting methods, such as the flow cytometry-based sorting method [72,78]. Additionally, MACS technology is also fast and efficient for stem cell separation. The flow cytometry and MACS technologies are both based on the expression of cell surface markers. For MACS, magnetic labeling using CD271 used a marker for isolation of MSCs from bone marrow and lipoaspirate. MACS microbeads, columns, and automated separators are available to apply in stem cell separation. ISCT published the guideline to the cell surface markers isolation BMSCs, which is suitable for clinical application [8]. Human BMSCs will be sorted with positive markers CD105, CD73, CD90 and negative markers CD45 (hematopoietic cell marker), CD34 (endothelial cell marker), and HLA-DR (leukocyte marker). Besides, other strategies that are based on the enrichment of SRO-1, CD146, SSEA-4, CD271, and MSC antigen-1 to purify BMSCs [29,79,80]. Samsonraj R.M et al. listed the surface antigen expressed in BMSCs [29]. The combination of CD49a, PDFGRα/β, EGFR, IGFR, and STRO-3 markers was also reviewed as an isolation criterion of BMSCs. The authors demonstrated that STRO-1 and PDGFRα makers supported the selection of BMSCs, which showed higher bone regeneration potential. While Feng-Juan Lv et al. opposed the phenotype and expression of stem cell surface markers are varied by the expansion culture condition [80]. Therefore, it is a clinical, legal, ethical obligation to follow GMP guidelines in the isolation of BMSCs, where the isolation and culture of BMSCs will be done in the automated systems [81,82,83]. The GMP-compliant isolation and expansion procedure of BMSCs will be discussed in the following section.",
        "It is necessary to amplify BMSCs in vitro before clinical application to get a sufficient number of cells for the therapeutic dose due to the low number of stem cells in bone marrow (0.001–0.01% total nucleated cells and 0.42% plastic adherent cells) [16,84]. In general, the risks of use BMSCs are strongly associated with culture conditions. Therefore, large-scale BMSCs production must adhere to the requirement of GMP standardization. Ayesha Aijaz et al. generally discussed bio-manufacturing for clinical cell therapies [85]. The authors demonstrated four parameters that should be considered: quality, cost, scalability, and sustainability in the cell therapy products manufacturing.",
        "In Europe, the European Medicines Agency approved mesenchymal stem cells as advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) from 2007 [86]. In the United States, BMSCs must comply with Current Good Tissue Practice (CGTP) guidelines. Accordingly, the BMSCs must be produced in the GMP-grade control to ensure reproducibility, safety, and efficiency of stem cell therapy. During the cultivation of BMSCs, sources and harvest methods, cell seeding plate and density, proliferation rate, and culture medium should be followed and then validated in the variety of cell expansion systems [87]. Generally, BMSCs can be harvested by either invasive or non-invasive methods. The noninvasive method relies on salvaging the large bones of a freshly slaughtered animal, whereas invasive methods can be applied on a live animal, followed by density gradient centrifugation. The noninvasive method was found to be much less cumbersome, however, it cannot be used to harvest BMSCs in humans. Invasive methods consist of perfusion or aspiration method, where the aspiration method yielded significantly higher than the perfusion method. However, the perfusion method is simple and safe with minimal contamination and it reduces the risk of acute graft versus host disease in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation [88]. Time culturing decreased the proliferation rate and multipotent differentiation potential of stem cells [87]. Moreover, the age of donors also influenced the proliferation rate of cultured BMSCs [35]. In terms of culture medium, Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplied with 10% of approved fetal calf serum (FCS) was basically used in the culture of BMSCs to minimize the variety of batch to batch variations of FCS and reduce the risk of allergies related to xenogeneic proteins to patients [89,90]. Plasma temp platelet lysate and platelet-rich plasma (2–8%) or growth factors, such as TGF-β, FGF2, or PGFEP, can be supplied in the media instead of serum. Those media efficiently maintain the morphology and multi-lineage differentiation capacity of the BMSCs population [90]. Many studies pointed to FGFs as major players in seft-renewing proliferation, cellular senescence, and aging. Additionally, FGF-2 not only promotes cell growth level, but also maintains specific stem cell markers and improves chondrogenic differentiation [91]. Therefore, FGF-2 is frequently added during the pre-selection of MSCs subpopulation. However, FGFs are key challenges for the cost-effective expansion of BMSCs. Researchers had been finding other components instead of FGFs. The animal component-free and serum-free media have been developed and marketed, which is convenient for the culture of human mesenchymal stem cells, such as MesenCult™-ACF Plus Medium (STEMCELL Technologies), CTS StemPro MSC SFM, and StemPro MSC SFM XenoFree (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA 02451) or Pro293a (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). In comparison to the traditional culture medium, human MSCs that were expanded in serum-free and xeno-free media showed better expansion, multipotentiality, and serve as suitable for the production of large scale, functionally competent MSCs for clinical applications [92]. In 2012, Natalie Fekete et al. validated five different GMP-compliant protocols for the isolation and expansion of BMSCs consisted of a single-step and four two-step protocols [81]. Single-step protocol was primary culture with one circle of seeding and harvesting steps, while two-step protocol contained two circles. The authors reported that the single-step or two-step protocols can be suitable to produce at least single therapeutic dose. The single-step protocol used short-time cultivation, whereas the two-step protocol was used to obtain a much higher amount of BMSCs and to reduce the costs for expansion. However, the authors also mentioned the long-term culture of BMSCs leads to a change in the genotype as well as differentiation characteristics of BMSCs. Besides, Yi et al. developed and optimized GMP compatible culture protocol, which is suitable for producing BMSCs for clinical uses. The final products, which were produced from cells obtained at passage 12, must be satisfy all of these criteria: pathologic microbes, mycoplasma, cytopathic effect and hemadsorption, cell morphology, virus test, MSC marker analysis, and cell viability. Karen Bieback et al. also reported typical clinical protocols for the isolation and expansion of MSCs [93]. The authors described the essential processes and necessary quality assessment parameters performed, including ENTRY CONTROL (cell number, viability, sterility) -IN PROCESS CONTROL (cell number, viability, sterility, clonogenicity, immune phenotype) -RELEASE CONTROL (cell dose, viability, immune phenotype, microbial, endotoxin, mycoplasma test) -POTENCY ASSAYS (clonogenicity, trilineage differentiation, immunomodulation, hematopoiesis regulation). That method is an efficacious and economical option in clinical settings. The released parameters for MSCs manufacturing (Table 3).",
        "Tissue culture treated flasks or dishes are important for traditional monolayer culture of mesenchymal stem cells; however, the traditional culture requires a class A cabinet to avoid a high risk of contamination with bacteria or fungi. Thus, closed and semi-automated/automated systems have been developed that fulfill GMP requirements [82,83,94]. The Quantum cell expansion system (Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO, USA), a hollow fiber bioreactor system, has been commonly used in several investigations [82,83]. Those scale-up cell manufacturing systems overcame the conventional methods in terms of minimal media exposure, manufacturing time, anticontamination, and labor costs. Moreover, the Quantum cell expansion system is reliable, reproducible, and most economical to produce sufficient BMSCs for a clinical trial (single dose of 100 × 106 cells/subject × 100 subjects) [83,94]. The authors described the full end-to-end protocol of the BMSCs manufacturing process, consisting of media preparation, set up the system, coating of fiber, loading sample, feeding, and harvesting. Additionally, the authors suggested using fibronectin, platelet lysate, and human plasma to coat the hollow of the quantum system when loading raw BMSCs [82].",
        "Lastly, the culture condition induced morphological, phenotypic, and genetic alterations of BMSCs, which Yang et al. investigated [95]. Long-term culture expansion reduces cellular proliferation, differentiation potential, homing, and immunomodulatory properties, while developing senescence and tumor generation [87]. The cultivation of BMSCs was interrupted at passages 25, where the cells might stop proliferation and go into senescence state [96]. Significantly, decreases in differentiation potentials were also observed due to passage [97]. Currently, several techniques are available to detect or quantify the genomic alteration, listed of conventional karyotype, Spectral Karyotype, Array-CGH (comparative genomic hybridization), virtual karyotype, FISH fluorescent in situ hybridization, microsatellite instability analysis, single nucleotide polymorphism array, gammaH2AX, telomere length by Southern, Sanger sequencing, NGS next-generation sequencing, the droplet digital PCR, micronuclei test, and comet assay. Additionally, it was also demonstrated that long-term cultures under hypoxic conditions prevent senescence, improve DNA damage response while maintaining differentiation potential. The authors determined that DMEM-based medium facilitated cell proliferation in the early passages, but reduced cell population doubling rate in the aged passages. It also caused a decrease in the expression of CD146, especially STRO-1, which was lost during in-vitro expansion. Besides, microscopic image demonstrated aging MSCs that were cultured with either medium formation increased morphological inhomogeneity and gene expression profile. Therefore, the differentiation potential of MSCs was also affected during culture period. MSCs are able to maintain adipogenic differentiation, whereas senescence significantly impaired osteogenic potential.",
        "BMSCs are well known for their multi-lineage differentiation potential into osteocytes, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and skeletal muscle [98,99,100]. In-vitro differentiation culture conditions generally regulate the differentiation capacity of BMSCs. The alkaline culture medium can stimulate the differentiation of BMSCs into chondrocytes [101]. Dexamethasone is required for osteogenic differentiation [102]. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) can induce BMSCs into osteocytes by regulating the expression of Runt-related transcription 2 (Runx2) [103]. Additionally, three-dimensional culture and azacytidine (an anticancer drug) can enhance the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation ability of BMSCs [104]. Unbalanced bidirectional differentiation between adipocytes and osteocytes might relate to osteoporosis, which characterized by decreasing the number of osteoblast cells and increasing adipocyte cells. To date, the co-treatment of estrogen can promote osteogenic differentiation, while inhibiting the adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs in osteoporosis patients. Besides, 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 inhibits PPARγ2, thus suppressing lipogenesis and adipogenic differentiation [99]. Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand [105] signaling inhibits osteogenesis, but does not affect adipogenesis of BMSCs [106]. Jicheng Wang et al. reported the role of miRNAs in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. The authors identified 17 miRNAs that were upregulated and five miRNAs were downregulated, which target various genes during osteoblast differentiation when compared to undifferentiated BMSCs [107]. These findings were consistent with the findings of Ying Chen et al. [108]. Moreover, a balanced differentiation of BMSCs also contributes to hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow transplantation [109]. In vivo, many factors, such as aging, obesity, irradiation, and chemotherapy, cause the alteration of the microenvironment, thus modulate differentiation capacity of transplanted BMSCs [109]. These factors regulate BMSCs differentiation by a series of signaling pathways, which results in the imbalance of adipogenic-osteogenic differentiation, leading to the accumulation of adipocytes and the attenuation of osteocytes at the implantation site.",
        "Interestingly, BMSCs are able to trans-differentiate into other cell types and de-differentiate back to the undifferentiated state in response to extracellular signals [110]. BMSCs can be differentiated and dedifferentiate into neurons and cardiomyocytes, respectively [111,112]. Lui et al. succeeded in inducting of BMSCs into neurocytes and reverting neurocytes to de-differentiated BMSCs in-vitro by removing the extrinsic factors [112]. De-differentiated BMSCs showed increasing cell survival and differentiation potential, thus improving cognition function of brain damage in rats when compared to unmanipulated BMSCs. Yannarelli et al. also investigated partly cardiomyocytes differentiation potential of BMSCs. Besides, partially cardiomyocytes differentiated cells can revert to undifferentiated state of MSCs, and potential to extended differentiation via the regulation of pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 [111].",
        "The wide use of BMSCs as regenerative medicine in the clinic requires strictly controlled quality in the process and the final product. Storage and transportation significantly influence the viability and differentiation capacity of BMSCs preparation prior to transplantation. Several medium and temperature conditions, as well as the maximum time of storage, have been evaluated, which supports the safety and potency of stem cell therapy [113,114,115]. Mesenchymal stem cells should be stored in 0.9% saline for less than two hours. After four hours, the proliferation of stem cells rapidly reduces, and the cell viability decreases when compared to fresh BMSCs (>90% of the cell population). Longer storage leads to a significant reduction of self-renewal and differentiation capacity [113]. The authors report that temperature (4 °C or room temperature) did not affect the viability of stem cells. Most recently, the trehalose-based solution has been recommended for the storage of BMSCs at 4 °C for 72 h [115]. This trehalose solution enhanced the recovery rates, the self-renewable capacity of BMSCs with a consistent phenotype and genotype, as well as the differentiation properties of BMSCs when compared to Plasma-Lyte® 148, HypoThermosol® FRS, and Ringer’s solution that is commonly used in clinical research [115]. Currently, there are no specific transportation systems for stem cells in clinical applications. Tomoki Aoyama et al. evaluated both frozen and non-frozen transportation systems and then suggested the critical parameters that are essential to be considered during transportation of BMCs [116]. The authors demonstrated that the transported materials and cell products require satisfying some requirements, including leakproofness, sterility, temperature stabilization, shock resistance, gas stability, UV shielding, and monitoring. DMSO can be used as cryoprotectant, but it has some adverse effects on patients, such as nausea, headache, hypertension, and diarrhea. Therefore, the International Stem Cell Initiative recommends the use of liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) for frozen stem cell transportation. However, a significant loss of living cells and increase in the proportion of apoptotic and senescence cells regarding frozen transportation should be considered. In non-frozen cell transportation, the control of temperature (37 °C) and cell metabolism (added preservation solution) is compromised. Besides, non-frozen transportation methods are not convenient, because of the limitation of transportation package for long distance.",
        "Stem cell banking was supposed to store a maximum number of samples with effective costs [114,117]. Cryovials or cryobags can be used in various sizes. Cryovial sizes vary from 2.0 to 4.5 cc, whereas the cryobag volumes mostly are bigger, from 25 to 60 cc. In addition, cryobags can be applied in closed automated systems, allowing for culture, selection, and storage procedures. However, cryovials are commonly used in an open system that requires sterility control during processing. BMSCs can be stored in liquid nitrogen (temperature always below −196 °C) for a long time (>1 year). Stem cell banking can hold 10,000 25-cc bags or 40,000 4-cc vials. Most importantly, the stem cell banking must be under the quality control at each time point to provide a high quantity and quality of cryopreserved samples.",
        "It is important to evaluate the quality of stem cell products for clinical applications. The identification of relevant and robust potency assays is not only a regulatory requirement, but it is also the standard for producing and delivering a product that is consistent, safe, and ultimately an effective therapy. It is no doubt that the cells that were collected from different tissue sources and expansion methods showed the same morphologic, cell surface markers, and differentiation characteristics (minimal criteria for MSCs defined by ISCT), but still had major differences in their biologic and functional actions. However, despite extensive ongoing researches regarding the use of BMSCs, there is no consensus on any potency assay for MSCs, because stem cells have a complex and/or not fully characterized mechanism of action. Currently, a single bioassay approach and multiple complementary assays approach have been investigated [118,119,120,121]. For instance, Lee et al. demonstrated that the flow cytometry-based quantitative IDO assay correlates with MSC’s inhibition of T cell proliferation and results in phase I of autologous MSC- based clinical trial for the treatment of osteoarthritis [120]. Chinnadurai et al. developed MSC secretome analysis (29 cytokines) and a quantitative RNA-based array (~40 genes) for genes specific to immunomodulatory and homing properties of MSCs [121]. Even then, a single bioassay method might not provide an adequate measure of the potency for a cellular product, such as BMSCs as multiple complementary assays. To date, the issue of developing appropriate potency assay for BMSCs remains very challenging. The test must include appropriate controls and standard materials; validate to meet the requirements, including accuracy, precision, repeatability, specificity, linearity and range, system suitability, and robustness; and, be convenient to perform as a quality control test.",
        "Human bone marrow stem cells have been investigated as potential therapeutic strategies for various human diseases, especially in the field of regeneration medicine [122]. BMSCs have the ability to self-renew, multi-lineage differentiation, migration, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulation, which may, together, support therapeutic effects in clinical applications. It is clear that both autologous and allogeneic BMSCs have been used in stem cell therapy. Autologous BMSCs can bring lower risks that are related to the immune systems, but a higher risk of tumor formation. Several studies have observed potential adverse effects of MSCs, including tumor growth, metastasis, and transformation into cancer cells [123,124,125]. Specifically, human pulmonary MSCs exhibited high proliferative capacity with unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements [126]. These adverse effects may be explained by a heterogeneous MSCs population used in experiments that contaminated “abnormal cells”—the cells initially grew slowly and then transformed into cancer cells. In fact, the impact of the administration of MSC on tumor growth is controversial. In vitro and in vivo studies have reported stimulation of tumor growth by providing supportive stroma, creating a permissive environment and/or reducing immune rejection of tumor cells [127,128]. A further risk that is associated with MSC expansion in vitro is senescence, which only occurs after long-term passage in culture, and subsequent differentiation into tumor cells after in vivo transplantation, has been shown in rodents [129]. Although concerns that MSCs might transform into tumor cells still exits, there is general agreement that BMSCs can be safe with no risk of malignant transformation, and so far no cancer has been yet reported in clinical trials for autologous cell therapy, thus making MSCs suitable for use in trials [96]. Constantly, in allogeneic cells transplantation, immune rejection of allogeneic cells might prevent the development of tumors in vivo. Allogenic BMSCs transplantation usually uses in the treatment in elderly patients, who have suppression of immune responses. Cell death or apoptosis might be observed within a few days after stem cell engraftment, due to harsh environmental conditions, anoikis, and inflammation [130]. Chronic inflammation inhibits the recruitment and survival of implanted cells, promotes the generation of ROS, thereby inducing apoptosis. Therefore, methods for reducing apoptosis and enhancing cell adhesion have been approached to improve the survival of the cells at the transplanted sites. The authors demonstrated pretreatment with cytokines, growth factors, and antiapoptotic molecules, genetic modification, and preconditioning can be useful for improving the survival rate of transfected cells. Besides, hypoxia or the three-dimensional cell culture system were also approached to improve the immunomodulatory properties of human MSCs. Figure 2 describes the process of autologous BMSCs transplantation on human.",
        "BMSCs have been investigated in the treatment of immune disorder diseases, including GVHD, type I diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [131]. By secreting soluble factors, MSCs can inhibit immune cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and activation, which result in the suppression of immune responses. GVHD is a severe inflammatory condition that is caused by the attacking of donor T cells to the immune system of the recipient after allogenic HSCs transplantation. To date, corticoids are commonly used in the initial treatment of GVHD and BMSCs as an alternative option to treat in corticoids-resistant patients. FDA approved a commercialized product, named Prochymal (Osiris Therapeutics Inc., Columbia, MD, USA), which contains BMSCs to treat GVHD, specifically in pediatric patients with serious corticoids resistance [132,133,134]. Recently, a meta-analysis has shown that BMSCs can significantly reduce the incidence rate of chronic GVHD but not acute GVHD in patients. To prevent GVHD, it is important to use BMSCs after HSCs implant to minimize the side effects of stem cell therapy [135]. Besides, BMSCs also applied to treat chronic inflammatory diseases [136,137]. A comparative study showed that the systemic infusion of BMSCs significantly improved symptoms of RA in mice [138]. BMSCs reduced bone erosions, synovitis and articular destruction, levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in serum and joint, which results in an improvement of inflammation state in RA mice. BMSCs are considered to be the best stem cells for the treatment of RA when compared to UCSCs and exfoliated deciduous teeth stem cells [138]. In addition, a randomized, triple-blind trial showed the improvement of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), visual analog scale (VAS), time to jelling, pain-free walking distance, and standing time in 30 RA patients treated with BMSCs [139]. However, the trial failed to prolong the therapeutic effects of BMSCs beyond 12 months. In SLE patients, BMSCs are safe and they contribute to improving the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, blood parameters, and overall survival rate [140,141,142]. JAK/STAT, PTEN/AKT, p53/p21, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways were investigated in mediating BMSC senescence and apoptosis, which might contribute to the development of SLE [143,144,145,146]. On the other hand, the infusion of BMSCs suppressed helper T-cell development, thus attenuating immune responses and inflammatory damage [147]. Type I and type II diabetes have been the targets of BMSCs therapy [148,149,150,151]. There are several completed and in processing clinical trials registered in the database of U.S National Library of Medicine that used BMSCs in phase I to phase III clinical trials. After nine months of BMSCs intravenously transfusion, diabetic patients are free from insulin injections without any side effects [151]. In addition, a randomized trial in 21 patients who underwent BMSCs infusion of a superior pancreaticoduodenal artery or splenic artery significantly reduced the insulin requirement dose, but did not show the improvement of insulin sensitivity [150]. Intravenous BMSCs failed to show the improvement of stem cell therapy in this trial. In addition, the evidence of BMSCs that may differentiate into β-cells is unclear. However, BMSCs can enhance the vascular generation, endothelial repair, and anti-inflammation through paracrine activity [149]. MSC-derived exosomes and microvesicles are important mediators of the paracrine activity. These extracellular vesicles can regulate host cells and surrounding microenvironment and improve the disease outcomes, which consist of mRNAs, microRNAs, cytokines, and growth factors [152,153,154,155]. In addition, the extracellular vesicles have been recognized as a drug delivery platform, which brings chemicals or drugs to the target cells [156].",
        "BMSCs have been widely applied to various neurodegenerative diseases, which consist of multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Intrathecal injection of expanded BMSCs are safe and enhanced the improvement parameters in advanced multiple sclerosis in the 10 patients studied for 3–6 months treatment [157]. Another study also agreed that intravenously delivered MSCs limit neuronal damage by indirectly regulating immune systems and regenerating the neurons [158]. Research group [159] recently published the protocol for assessing the safety and efficacy of a single intravenous dose of BMSCs for multiple sclerosis, which is the guideline for studying BMSCs in humans [159]. BMSCs transplantation has shown self-renewable and neural protective properties in ALS patients. BMSCs are safe in phase I/IIa clinical trial in ALS patients [160,161,162]. Intravenous and intrathecal injection of BMSCs showed a reduction of the ALS Functional Rating Scale and Forced Vital Capacity percentage in all of the treated patients [161]. In PD, BMSCs have the ability to regenerate damaged neurons [163,164]. Moreover, BMSCs can improve the dopamine transporter binding activity, which results in the recovery and protection of dopaminergic neurons [165]. Several clinical trials are conducted while using BMSCs on PD patients (NCT02611167, NCT01446614, NCT00976430). The completed trials showed improvement in PD patients without any side effects after 36 months of BMSCs transplantation [163]. Human BMSCs reduced IL-1, IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in serum and oxidative stress, which showed the anti-inflammation potential and regulation of the expression of amyloid β1–42 genes and, thus, improved the symptoms of AD [166]. The improvement effects were seen in rat intracerebral hemorrhage after the administration of BMSCs to induce anti-inflammation and neurogenesis properties [167]. However, the therapeutic effects of BMSCs are still being investigated, and the future results may provide better evidence to widely apply BMSCs in the clinic.",
        "Lastly, BMSCs have shown potential on the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative disease of bone [168,169,170,171,172,173,174]. In a meta-analysis study, BMSCs improved knee joint cartilage degeneration, joint damage, and significantly reduced pain [168]. Six clinical trials showed an improvement of patient-reported outcomes, that support stem cell injection in knee osteoarthritis [175]. A systematic review of 659 studies showed a significant reduction of knee pain, self-reported physical function, and cartilage quality evidence to use in rehabilitation for OA patients [176]. Besides, BMSCs is also intended in the treatment of sports injuries [177,178].",
        "Overall, BMSCs are popular adult stem cells and they have long been therapeutically applied in various diseases. This review summarized the preclinical and clinical studies of BMSCs in Table 4 and Figure 3. The number and size of trials are still limited; therefore, it is necessary to conduct wide studies that will support the use of BMSCs in clinical application.",
        "Research on the BMSCs has been gradually increasing over recent years. BMSCs became the most commonly mesenchymal stem cells used in the clinic as regenerative medicine. In-vitro studies on isolation, culture and differentiation, and storage processes of BMSCs support the wider application of BMSCs in clinical practice. As the number of BMSCs is very low in bone marrow, the expansion culture is mandatory for producing clinical-grade production. Under the long-term expansion, BMSCs may undergo senescence and transformation that contribute to the development of tumors and metastases. Therefore, the processing of BMSCs must satisfy the good manufacturing practice requirement to ensure the quantity and quality of BMSCs, which are strongly associated with the safety and outcome of BMSCs therapy. Most of the preclinical and clinical trials have shown promising results of BMSCs on the treatments of various diseases with few adverse effects during follow-up periods. Currently, BMSCs therapy has been used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, immune disorder diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and sporty injuries. Autologous and allogeneic BMSCs both can be used in clinical trials and exhibit positive results. However, the number of subjects in clinical trials and conditions of treatment is limited. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct more randomized, controlled clinical trials to find the best standards for BMSC therapy to evaluate the safety and benefits of each application.",
        "It is now clear that stem cell therapy has gained interest in recent years. Preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted to provide evidence for using stem cells, especially BMSCs in the clinic. There are several issues that need to be further investigated before applying stem cells. Recent studies have shown BMSCs can stimulate lung tumor growth and metastasis [194,195,196]. Few adverse effects were also reported by the treatment of BMSCs. Moreover, the number of human trials is limited in phase I and phase II; and, lacks phase III and IV trials. Therefore, further studies may focus on the safety, molecular mechanism, and standardization of the stem cell preparation processes as well as shipping and clinical application. The safety of BMSCs therapy still needs to be carefully investigated by expanding in terms of a number of studies, and the size of subjects in phase I/II. Cells harvesting, expansion processes, and quality control must follow a standard protocol or GMP guideline. Diseases and patient conditions must optimize cell dose, route, and interval of BMSCs administration. In addition, understanding the molecular mechanism in the homeostasis, regulation tissue repair, modulation of immune responses, and differentiation of BMSCs may support new methods for improving the efficacy of trials. Finally, a combination of BMSCs therapy and other methods should be combined that may provide promising outcomes of BMSCs applications. BMSC therapy combined with drug treatment for ischemic stroke is potentially a feasible and efficient therapeutic approach. They exert synergistic effects in different ways, including enhancing stem cell migration and survival, promoting endogenous stem cell proliferation, reducing apoptosis, and angiogenesis. For instance, sodium ferulate accelerates BMSC migration toward the ischemic zone in a rat model [197]; valproate- or lithium-pretreated BMSCs stimulate cell migration and targeting ability and promote functional recovery [198]; erythropoietin acts synergistically with MSCs to potentiate neurogenesis [199]. This combination approach should be further evaluated in clinical trials.",

        "Adoptive immunotherapy with engineered T cells is a significant therapeutic tool in the field of cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and transplantation. More specifically, therapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells (CAR T) has demonstrated great potential in treating various hematological malignancies and is now commercially available for relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphomas and Multiple Myeloma (1). In addition, the use of CAR T cells or CAR-engineered regulatory T cells (CAR Treg) has shown pre-clinical and clinical utility for diseases beyond cancer such as autoimmune diseases (SLE, RA, MS etc) (2–4), graft-versus-host disease (5, 6), transplant rejection (7, 8). These results dictate for further advances allowing expanding the applicability of adoptive T cell therapy for more patients. Nevertheless, current manufacturing approaches for engineered T cells limit the feasibility of cost-effective, easier and broader application of this effective therapy. Autologous engineered-T cell manufacturing requires a time-consuming process with long vein-to-vein times, while sometimes the production can be unsuccessful (9). Patient-derived products are highly variable, depending on the type and stage of the disease, previous therapies and immune cell composition leading to variable clinical outcomes (10). Allogeneic T cells from healthy donors could provide a solution to several of the aforementioned limitations and are being currently clinically tested as an alternative source of CAR T cells (11). Obviously, substantial genomic editing of the T cell receptor (TCR) and HLA genes is essential for the use of allogeneic cells in order to avoid graft-versus-host reactions and limit graft rejection. However, genetic engineering of primary autologous or allogeneic T cells in a multiplex manner is very challenging (12), as it currently results in a) reduced production yield; b) genotoxicity due to undesired off-target effects and gene translocations; c) an exhausted T cell phenotype and product due to the requirement of extended ex vivo expansion.",
        "To overcome these limitations, the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has been proposed as an off-the-shelf source of therapeutic T cells (13). iPSCs can theoretically grow infinitely, are easy to genetically manipulate, and can differentiate into different types of immune cells, including T cells. Thus, iPSC have the potential to serve as an unlimited source of T (iT) and CAR T (iCAR T) cells. In contrast to primary T cells, genetic engineering of iPSCs results in fully modified clonal lines, which could be extensively evaluated resulting in a stable safe source.",
        "Most research-grade T cell-development protocols from iPSC have limited translational potential since they include non-compliant good manufacturing practice (GMP) components, making them incompatible for clinical use due to potential xenogeneic immune reactions. Translating a research protocol into a clinically relevant production process is a critical step in the development of new therapies and interventions. Recent efforts are focusing on the development of scalable and good manufacturing practice compliant protocols with serum-free, xeno-free, and feeder-free procedures.",
        "Here, we aim to provide an overview of the research progress of the last decade regarding the effective generation of functional iT and iCAR T cells from iPSC, while highlighting the future directions essential for translational and clinical development in this field. The production of iT cells rely on a complex, orchestrated and highly regulated differentiation process divided in three pivotal stages: the establishment of a master iPSC clone, the progression through hematopoietic differentiation and the subsequent specification of T cells. We will revisit the available research protocols, paying special attention to their alignment with GMP standards, scalability considerations, and their potential for clinical application. Additionally, the integration of safety measures and quality controls for clinical application will be explored, as these facets constitute imperative prerequisites for the eventual clinical deployment of iT and iCAR T cells.",
        "The successful translation of a research protocol into a clinically relevant production process is a critical step in the development of new therapies and interventions. Current research-grade protocols for T cell development from iPSC have demonstrated efficient iCAR T cell production; however, there are still several challenges that are being preclinical addressed, while the first clinical application of iCAR T cells is ongoing (NCT04629729) (14). These efforts to expand the clinical use of iCAR T cells are currently focused on achieving efficient GMP-compliant iPSC generation, cultivation, genetic modification and differentiation towards mature T cells. The labor-intensive nature of preparing the product for clinical use includes the development of GMP-compliant manufacturing practices, standardized procedures, scalability considerations and adherence to other directives and regulations (15).",
        "All reagents, raw materials and disposables must meet the highest available quality standards, preferably manufactured under GMP guidelines. Rigorous quality control systems and standard procedures extend not only to reagents but also to processes themselves, ensuring both the quality and the consistency of the protocols used during manufacturing. Certified and qualified materials and equipment, reliable suppliers, detailed SOPs (standard Operational Procedures) and process validation steps are incorporated in the manufacturing and every procedure is then performed in fully equipped dedicated cleanrooms (16).",
        "In the context of research-grade culture and differentiation, available protocols, that usually involve co-culture with animal-derived components, raise regulatory concerns related to variability between batches, scalability and safety due to potential xenogeneic immune reactions. Therefore, a shift towards the use of human or chemically defined components in the culture, genetic modification and preservation of cells is essential (16). This transition sets the stage for future endeavors towards up-scaling to bioreactor technology and therefore industrial scale production. We note, however, that there might be differences between regulatory regions of the world regarding the obligatory requirements of the use of xenogeneic materials (17). If no other compliant alternatives is available, and sufficient control (testing and sensitivity) can be shown, the use of a non-compliant material could be defended at the competent authority.",
        "Prioritizing a translational approach from early preclinical stages and addressing the necessary steps required for GMP compliance will enhance the prospects of successfully translating research outcomes into clinical applications, facilitating a smoother transition and precluding potential bottlenecks. Given the absence of a standardized method for generating iT cells, substantial efforts are still needed to establish robust, reliable and GMP-compliant manufacturing protocols. Moreover, these protocols should allow a more efficient, clinical-grade production, emphasizing the generation of the T cell subtype with the desired functionality (cytotoxic CD8αβ cells but also helper or regulatory CD4 cells) (18, 19). A pivotal aspect of this effort involves the establishment of relevant quality control and bioassay tests tailored to the specific medicinal product, as will be discussed further.",
        "iPSCs can theoretically support endless genome editing to accommodate desired characteristics of their lymphoid derivatives, such as tumor-specificity, enhanced function and histocompatibility. Different genetic modifications may also have an impact on the quality and yield of iT and iCAR T cell products. The accommodation of as many as possible optimized immunotherapeutic properties in the iCAR T cells, requires the facilitation and flexibility of gene editing processes. What are key aspects to consider when developing a CAR-engineered iPSC master clone? (See summary in \nFigure 1\n).",
        "Summary of general aspects for the generation of CAR-engineered iPSC clones. Initially, either CD34+ cells or T cells obtained from donors are reprogrammed into hiPSCs using a genomic integration-free method. Following thorough characterization of pluripotent cells, these hiPSCs are engineered to express a CAR for targeted tumor cell killing. Notably, the CAR construct incorporates elements to control its expression and prevent the effect of tonic signals during T cell development. To achieve a universal T cell product, the hiPSC-derived CAR T cells undergo HLA and TCR elimination with the addition of NK inhibitors to protect against host NK rejection. Additionally, an inducible suicide gene system is introduced into the CAR hiPSCs, serving as a fail-safe mechanism the event of unforeseen complications following T cell infusion. Created with BioRender.com.",
        "The first attempts to generate hiPSCs succeeded by using integrated retroviruses to express the specific genes encoding for the reprogramming transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) (20, 21). Alternative methods for generating hiPSCs without integrating foreign genetic material have been explored to address these issues including using Sendai viruses (22), episomal vectors (23, 24), synthetic modified mRNA (25), minicircle DNAs (26), microRNAs (27), and proteins (28). While integration-free reprogramming methods have different reprogramming efficiencies, they hold the most promise for developing clinical products due to the lower risk of insertional mutagenesis.",
        "Interestingly, there is much evidence that hiPSCs retain epigenetic (29, 30) and transcriptomic (31) characteristics resembling their original cell type, a phenomenon known as somatic memory. Somatic memory could influence the differentiation potential of hiPSCs, causing them to preferentially differentiate into the cell type of origin, sometimes at the expense of other lineages. Specifically, hiPSCs derived from umbilical cord blood cells exhibit enhanced efficiency in differentiating into the hematopoietic lineage compared to hiPSCs derived from fibroblast (31, 32) and keratinocyte (30), despite showing comparable pluripotent characteristics at their undifferentiated state Notably, unlike murine iPSCs, where somatic memory fades after 10 passages, the observed differences in differentiation potential among hiPSCs remained consistent even after extended culture of up to 20 passages (29, 33),. Up to date, T cells have been generated from T cell-derived iPSC (TiPSC) (34, 35) as well as from non-T cell-derived iPSC (other hematopoietic cell or fibroblast) (36–39), while no detailed studies have been performed on the impact of the cell of origin on the functional properties of the generated iT cells.",
        "In the context of universally available products, various strategies have been suggested in order to endow iT and iCAR T cells with reduced immunogenicity and alloreactivity. Mismatched MHC class I on adoptively transferred T cells triggers host-versus-graft (HvG) responses from endogenous lymphocytes, limiting the survival and persistence of therapeutic donor cells (40). The disruption of β2m, the gene encoding for β2-microglobulin, is the most common strategy for partially overcoming HLA matching barriers (41, 42). B2M monomers combine with major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules, which are present on the surface of all nucleated cells, including T cells (43). However, loss of HLA class I expression results in a “missing-self” response, in which cells lack an essential inhibitory ligand, making them susceptible to attacks by natural killer (NK) cells (44, 45). To address this issue, several additional strategies have been explored. One approach involves the combination of β2m knock-out with the introduction of HLA-E over-expression. HLA-E binds to the CD94/NKG2A receptor on NK cells (46, 47) and protects edited cells from NK-mediated killing (48). However, this approach does not address the case of NK cells lacking the NKG2A receptor. Another approach to impair the NK cell response against HLA class I-negative cellular products is the overexpression of CD47, a molecule that serves as a “don’t eat me” signal (49). To enhance immunological tolerance, a different strategy entails deleting both β2m (HLA class I) and CIITA (HLA class II) genes in iPSCs while introducing HLA-G, CD47, and PD-L1 (50). This strategy is based on the knowledge that HLA-G1 can suppress KIR2D+ NK cell populations (51–53) and the well-established immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1 inhibits T-cell activation (54, 55). Another group developed selectively deleted HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-class II but retained HLA-C, a non-canonical HLA molecule (56, 57), that is expected to inhibit the activation of NK cells (58). In addition, a recent study reported the generation of human iT cells that can evade NKG2A+ and DNAM-1+ NK cell recognition, by knocking out the NK cell activating ligand PVR as well as both β2m and CIITA, while simultaneously introducing HLA-E through transduction in hiPSCs (59).",
        "Even when using hypoimmunogenic iT cells lacking expression of HLA molecules, Graft-versis-host disease (GvHD) can still pose a significant challenge due to the presence of T cell receptors (TCRs), possibly leading to the alloreactivity of donor iT cells. Genetic disruption of the TRAC locus to eliminate αβTCR surface expression has become a widely used gene editing method to prevent GvHD in allogeneic CAR T cells (60–62). One strategy, for instance, involves integrating the CAR transgene into the TRAC locus, resulting in TCRless iPSC-derived CAR T cells with reduced risk of triggering GvHD (14, 63).",
        "Endowing human iT cells with tumor specific functions has been achieved by the expression of a CAR (34). Introduction of the CAR transgene in order to generate iCAR T cells can be performed either by genetic engineering in the iPSC level (34, 64) or at the stage of the already generated iT cells (65). Generation of CAR-engineered iPSC clones has the advantage of requiring only a single genetic engineering step and providing after differentiation to the lymphoid lineage a more uniform iCAR T cell product. However, the CAR engineering strategies employed can impact the lymphoid lineage commitment during differentiation. Premature and constitutive expression of a CAR during iPSC-to-T cell development reduces NOTCH1 (Notch receptor 1) expression and disrupts the normal regulation of downstream genes,leading to lineage skewing of iCAR T cells to innate/γδTCR-like CD8αα+ T cell features (34, 66), and expression of NK cell surface markers (34, 38, 66). To partially restore the conventional CD8αβ phenotype (63), it is crucial to regulate CAR signal strength and the timing of expression. Additionally, the choice of different CAR designs plays a significant role in influencing the iT phenotype since 1BBζ-based constructs allow the development of CD8αβ iT cells in contrast to CD28ζ-based CARs (67, 68).",
        "Besides viral delivery methods, the use of gene editing has emerged as the most efficient strategy to introduce genetic modifications into hiPSC, including the overexpression of transgenes or the silencing/knockout of specific genes. The initial nuclease families used were: meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). The emergence of the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated nucleases (Cas) system has revolutionized genome editing due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to edit β2m, CIITA, HLA and TRAC genes in iPSC (49, 59, 69–72). Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 can facilitate multiplex genome editing, allowing for the simultaneous modification of multiple genes through the use of multiple guide RNAs (56, 57). In addition, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been harnessed for precise gene insertion at specific genomic locations through homologous recombination. For example, it has been utilized to insert a CAR into the TRAC locus, enabling the creation of TCR-less CAR T cells derived from hiPSC (63) and insert NK inhibitor molecules into the safe harbor site AAVS1 locus (50). While CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing avoids random integration events, it carries the risk of adverse genomic events by introducing double-strand breaks at off-target sites (73, 74), which can lead to frameshift mutations, chromosomal translocations, and complex rearrangements within edited cells (75–77). Newer generations of high fidelity Cas9 nucleases have been developed with reduced off-target activity (Cas12a) (78). Nickases, which are modified Cas9 nucleases containing only one functional domain to generate a DNA single-strand break, can be combined with base editors (BE) to induce specific mutations. Finally, the prime editing method involves a nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase complexed with a prime editing guide RNA and can generate targeted insertions, deletions or base substitutions (79).",
        "The use of hiPSC as a cellular source for therapeutic clinical applications is accompanied by safety concerns regarding the potential tumorigenicity of their derivatives as well as contamination of the final product with residual undifferentiated iPSC that could potentially lead to the uncontrollable formation of a teratoma. Additionally, strategic engineering to confer hypoimmunogenic traits to these cells, including the absence of MHCs and the expression of CD47 and PD-1, could make them resistant to immune surveillance. To address the risks associated with tumorigenicity, inducible suicide gene systems can be used as a safeguard system. The Herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) system (80, 81), when combined with ganciclovir, effectively eliminates tumorigenic cells in murine iPSCs (82) and human iPSCs (83). However, HSV-TK is a viral protein which can trigger an immune response against the transplanted cells. Moreover the HSV-TK system entails a relatively slow process of cell killing, and is often incomplete due to its inability to target slowly growing cells effectively (84, 85). In contrast, the inducible caspase-9 (iC9) protein, a fusion protein of human caspase-9 and a modified FK506-binding protein, can operate independently of the cell cycle, enabling the rapid initiation of apoptosis of transduced cells within a few hours. The iC9 system can induce of iC9-expressing TiPSC and iCAR T cells in vitro and in vivo without alteration in pluripotency and T cell differentiation potential of TiPSC (86). Genome editing can further refine this system by targeting integration of the iCasp9 cassette to a safe-harbor locus.",
        "The efforts to make full cGMP iPSC lines (\nFigure 2\n) starts by obtaining the donor cells, while following the appropriate guidelines including giving written and legally valid informed consent. The informed consent should include terms for potential research and therapeutic uses, potential for commercial application, disclosure of incidental findings and issues specific to the intervention type (16, 17, 87). In order to overcome the concerns of insertional mutagenesis of viral vectors, several non-integrating reprogramming methods have been developed. Recombinant proteins (88), DNA plasmids (23, 89), Sendai virus (90–93) or mRNA-based methods (25, 94) are all non-integrative technologies used to transiently express transcription factors needed to induce cell reprogramming. Overall, although these methods show lower reprograming efficiency than integrating methods and inconsistency the reprograming frequencies are still sufficient to recover iPSC clones when starting from sufficient cell numbers. mRNA transfer has been the most efficient non-integrating reprogramming technology so far, but it is considered a laborious technique and the generated iPSC show extremely low rates of aneuploidy and karyotype abnormalities (95, 96). Nevertheless, comparison of the reprogramming methods within the same starting material, culture time and conditions and comparison to the parental cells is still missing to properly assess differences in efficiency and potential genomic instabilities.",
        "iPSC clone development: research vs cGMP methods. The overall goal is to ensure that the entire process, from donor acquisition to iPSC expansion and culture, adheres to strict quality and safety GMP standards essentials for clinical applications and therapies. The process initiates with the donor cell acquisition adhering to ethical guidelines and obtaining legally valid informed consent. The comprehensive informed consent covers various aspects including potential applications in research and therapy, considerations for commercial use, disclosure of incidental findings, and intervention-specific issues. Non-integrative methods are employed for clinical-grade iPSCs reprograming such as recombinant proteins, DNA plasmids, Sendai virus, and mRNA-based approaches to minimize the risk of genetic alterations as compared to integrating viral systems also used in research. A crucial distinction between research-graded iPSCs and cGMP-compatible iPSCs lies in the iPSC expansion step. Research-grade iPSCs can be cultured on MEFs or Matrigel with animal protein-containing medium, whereas cGMP iPSC culture must reach a defined animal origin-free, serum-free, xeno-free environment. This requirement extends to the components of reagents for iPSC dissociation and cryopreservation media. Furthermore, clinical-grade iPSCs undergo development in a scaled-up culture system using an automated, closed system designed for industrial use. To address these challenges, cGMP iPSCs can be cultivated in 2D factory flasks and in suspension within bioreactors, employing diverse methods such as 3D iPSC spheroids, culturing onto microcarriers, and encapsulation in hydrogels. Created with BioRender.com.",
        "Focus on optimizing ingredients, quality and consistency of matrices and media have reach considerable development towards a defined animal origin-free, serum-free, xeno-free iPSC culture environment certifiable under cGMP. To ensure suitability for clinical grade protocols several synthesized human recombinant extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or peptides have been developed for iPSC maintenance. Laminin, a major ECM protein during embryogenesis, has proven an efficient adhesion, survival and iPSC self-renewal (97–99) and has become popular as a natural scaffold to transition from research to clinical trials due to its capacity for cell expansion (100) in cost-effective and time-efficient method (101). Other ECM substrates like fibronectin or vitronectin as well as synthetic defined substrate based coatings (ex. Synthemax II-SC, CellStart) have been also used (102).",
        "The culture medium used is another critical component as it provides the necessary growth factors and optimal microenvironment for iPSC maintenance. Chemically defined, animal origin-free culture media (ex. mTeSR-AOF (103–105), StemFit AK02N (65, 106), Essential 8 (E8) (102, 107) (108), HIDEF-B8 (109) as well as cryopreservation media options are commercially available. As enzymatic passaging of iPSC is associated with increased genomic instability (110), chemically defined, enzyme-free dissociation methods (EDTA based) were developed to circumvent this problem (111). Selection of the optimal cGMP conditions should be based on keeping the balance between iPSC expansion, preservation of pluripotency and genomic stability (112).",
        "To satisfy the increasing clinical requirement of iPSCs the potential of scaling up iPSC culture several automated platforms are available to provide automated, closed system and customizable settings for coating, cell seeding, media feeding and cell harvesting of adherent cells such as the CliniMACS Prodigy Platform (Milteny) or the Quantum Cell Expansion System (100). In this later, capillary tubes are coated with matrix and then loaded with iPSCs providing a very large surface area for cells to attach to, while keeping a small physical footprint. However, in this system, cell growth is challenging to monitor (113) and the expansion of iPSC culture still remains modest for industrial use. To overcome these issues, various possibilities to scale up iPSC culture in suspension in bioreactors exist including self-assembled 3D spheroid aggregate (114–120) culture and cultivated cells in microcarriers or hydrogels. Cells can be cultured on microcarriers, increasing the cell surface while maintaining reproducible suspension cultures in closed systems (121–124). Several types of microcarriers are available with different coatings, cell attachment properties and sizes, that will provide different cell expansion and pluripotency maintenance while maintaining normal genomic stability (125–127). Microencapsulation of iPSC cells with hydrogels, like alginate, is also a potent option for successful up-scaled iPSC maintenance and expansion (128–131). However, cost effectiveness of some of these methods still needs to be considered.",
        "Finally, quality control testing and release criteria need to be established to ensure product sterility, cell identity and characterization and genetic stability of the iPSC master product (\nTable 1\n). To this end, the international stem cell banking initiative (16) and the Global Alliance for iPSC therapies (132) currently provide general guidance regarding clinical-grade iPSC standards. Since procedures to obtain master iPSC lines are not always performed under full cGMP and the cell product itself cannot be sterilized, donors and the resulting donor cells should be screened with rigorous viral (human immunodeficiency virus HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus), bacterial, fungi, mycoplasma and endotoxin sterility tests. Moreover, clinical grade iPSC cells need to be fully characterized to confirm cell identity, genomic integrity, pluripotency, purity and potency as well as to manage the risk associated with the presence of atypical or spontaneously differentiating cells. Cell reprograming efficiency and purity of the cell line is widely evaluated by flow cytometry and immunostaining, analyzing expression of commonly used pluripotency stem cell markers like Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA-3 and SSEA-4. A minimum of two positive markers from this panel is mandatory, combining at least one intracellular (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2) and one extracellular marker (TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA-3 and SSEA-4. Positive expression of these markers should be consistent and homogenous in the population analyzed with over 70% of positive cells (133, 134). Based on the description reported by Yu et al. (2007) (21), iPSC culture should maintain their typical morphology with compact rounded colonies and smooth edges, and a high nucleus-cytoplasm ratio. Genome integrity of the iPSC line is evaluated by single tandem repeat (STR) genotyping to confirm a matching identity between the source cells and the reprogramed cell line (102, 134). For gene-edited iPSC lines, assessment of the guide RNA quality, presence of the wildtype sequence, proof of any off-target effect and sequence analysis of the target pre and post editing needs to be provided. Lastly, testing for the presence of reprogramming vectors is mandatory to confirm clearance or silencing of these vectors. Clearance to an acceptable threshold of <1 plasmid copy per 100 cells must be demonstrated (134). Tests to currently show clearance of Sendai virus and mRNA methods are being developed. Potency of the generated cells is confirmed by carefully analyzing their differentiation potential into all three germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm) (100, 133, 134). The most widely accepted and available of these are Pluritest™ (135) and hPSC ScoreCard™ (136). Finally, iPSC are known to be prone to genomic instability which raises potential hazards around cell transformation and risk for causing malignancies in patients. Some consensus and guidelines are slowly emerging to assure genome integrity and stability of iPSC (137, 138). Karyotyping, using G-banding, has been considered the gold standard method to report karyological analysis of iPSC. A universal clinical standard recommended is a 20-metaphase karyotypic analysis with 95% certainty of diploidy and is widely accepted by regulators worldwide. Newer and more accessible technologies are being developed as KaryoLite BoBs® and Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays although each have significant differences in sensitivity, resolution and each has limitations for routine QC in terms of cost and time (133). SNP array offers higher resolution, enable to detect subchromosomal changes and single point mutations, deletions or duplications. SNP is recommended for information only, while karyotyping is a mandatory control. Extra whole genome analysis can also voluntarily be performed. Online tools such as the Decipher interface or the Variant Effect Predictor can help to identify genomic abnormalities and predict the possible effects (138).",
        "Quality control assessment of iPSCs clones.",
        "The combination of the different tests and criteria should provide enough information to determine the quality and safety of the iPSC line. Although specific assays and standards are not yet defined, consensus on specific parameters and guidelines on essential information needed is being build up in the area to ensure successful clinical grade iPSC application.",
        "In order to develop protocols and methods to generate cells of the hematopoietic lineage, including T lymphocytes, from iPSC one should take into account the physiologic developmental processes. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development occurs in three sequential waves of cells characterized by distinct locations, timing, and differentiation potential (139, 140). The initial wave, referred to as “primitive hematopoiesis,” occurs at the yolk sac and is responsible for generating various blood cells that together establish the embryo’s blood circulation and initial immune system (141). The second, pro-definitive hematopoiesis, originates in yolk sac and provides erythro-myeloid progenitors and lympho-myeloid progenitors that migrate across the embryo, supplying blood cells until the time of birth (142). The third wave, termed “definitive hematopoiesis” emerges within the embryo from hemogenic endothelial cells in the dorsal aorta of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. Unlike the previous waves, this wave is capable of giving rise to the first true HSPCs that exhibit robust long-term self-renewal capabilities and have the potential to differentiate into all hematopoietic lineages, including mature erythrocytes switching from fetal to adult globin, as well as all lymphoid lineages, including B cells and T cells. Definitive HSPCs produced during this stage initially localize in the fetal liver and subsequently colonize in the bone marrow, where they facilitate lifelong hematopoiesis (143, 144).",
        "The initial step to successfully generate definitive HSPCs in vitro involves inducing mesoderm lineage through primitive streak by specific signaling pathways like bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), activin/nodal and Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) pathway (145). In the early stages of mesodermal specification, the expression of Brachyury (T), followed by the expression of KDR kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), also referred to as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), is pivotal for further differentiation (146). VEGFR guides mesoderm cells with KDR to transition into the endothelial cell stage. Within this endothelial population, a distinct cell type known as hemogenic endothelium (HE) exists with potential to give rise to hematopoietic lineage cells. The HE exhibit markers typical of endothelial cells, including platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule PECAM-1 (CD31), VE-cadherin (CD144), and hematopoietic lineage progenitor marker CD34 (147, 148). In the final step, a significant morphological shift occurs as these cells detach from neighboring endothelial cells, forming round floating clusters of HSPCs for definitive hematopoiesis. This cellular transition, termed the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, occurs after hematopoietic transcription factors such as Runx1, Gata2, and Sox17 are upregulated within a specific subgroup of HE cells (149). Consequently, these newly generated HSPCs express not only CD34 but also CD43, a pan-hematopoietic marker that distinguishes them from endothelial cells (150).",
        "Various methods have been established to generate HSCs from hiPSCs and hESCs in vitro, aiming to closely replicate the key features of definitive hematopoiesis as described above. The hematopoietic differentiation in vitro can occur through three distinct approaches. Firstly, it can be conducted via co-culturing with murine stromal cells such as S17, MS5, C3H101/2 and OP9 (151–154). Notably, the OP9 stromal cell line was initially derived from a newborn mouse carrying a mutation in the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) gene (155). Due to this mutation, OP9 stromal cells are unable to produce functional M-CSF, which in turn prevents them from supporting the differentiation of macrophages. Nevertheless, the OP9 cell line has emerged as the most widely used stromal cell line to induce hematopoietic differentiation of hPSCs. The efficiency of OP9 co-culture induction can be improved by various combinations of factors such as stem cell factor (SCF), BMP4 and FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L). The studies have provided evidence of the efficiency of murine stromal cell co-cultures in generating definitive hematopoietic progenitors with lymphoid potential (153, 155) and long‐term engraftment potential (156). However, the use of mouse cells poses compatibility challenges for clinical product development due to concerns about xenogeneic antigen contamination.",
        "A second approach is the spontaneously formed 3D organoids named embryoid bodies (EBs). EBs faithfully replicate the spatial organization observed in embryo development, closely mimicking the multicellular arrangement found in actual human organs. This 3D structure promotes cell-to-cell interactions, facilitates cell communication, and allows for the exchange of substances. Consequently, EB systems have been widely utilized to generate specific cell types, including hematopoietic cell lineage, by employing combinations of inhibitors, small molecules, and other growth factors. Sturgeon et al. successfully guided hiPSC to differentiate into definitive CD34+ HSPCs by inhibiting activin-nodal signaling through SB431542 or activating the Wnt signaling using CHIR99021 during the EB formation in serum-free condition. Remarkably, the CD34+ cells produced through this method demonstrated the ability to differentiate into erythrocytes expressing adult globin and lymphoid cells (157). Furthermore, when combined with genetic modification involving the overexpression of specific transcription factors, the EB method effectively generated HSPCs with engraftment potential in a mouse model (158–160).",
        "Spherical formation of EBs presents challenges due to significant heterogeneity of differentiated cells and difficulty in monitoring hematopoietic processes within them. As a result, 2D monolayer feeder-free method for inducing hematopoietic differentiation in vitro has been developed iPSCs are seeded onto a surface coated with extracellular matrices and subsequently, different combinations of cytokines and small molecules are introduced at specific stages during the culture to lead the 3-stage differentiation process (35, 161–165). These refinements have simplified the monolayer method into a cost-effective and straightforward strategy for generating HSPCs suitable for clinical applications.",
        "Physiological T-cell development takes place within the thymus, where bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors migrate through the bloodstream, commit to the T-cell lineage and undergo further maturation to become functional T lymphocytes (166). This commitment and maturation process is largely driven by the Notch signal transduction pathway, which plays a central role in initiating a T-cell gene program in these cells upon their arrival in the thymus (167, 168). Upon their entry into the thymus, these progenitors undergo a commitment to become early thymic progenitors (ETP). Following this initial commitment, ETPs embark on a journey through a series of differentiation stages, culminating in the formation of mature T cells. These stages include the development of immature CD4/CD8 double-negative thymocytes, immature CD4 single-positive thymocytes (ISP cells), and immature CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes (DP cells). Following a series of positive and negative selection processes, DP cells undergo further maturation, giving rise to two distinct subpopulations: naïve mature CD4 single-positive (CD4SP) thymocytes and CD8 single-positive (CD8SP) thymocytes (169).",
        "The recognition of Notch signaling as a critical regulator of T cell commitment has resulted in significant advancements in methods for generating T cells in vitro. Initially, researchers employed an OP9 cell line that had been genetically modified to overexpress Notch Delta-like ligand 1 (DL-1). Similar to thymic stromal cells, this modified cell line, referred to as OP9-DL1, was employed to establish a co-culture system, which served as the starting point for initiating T cell development in vitro, including interleukin 7 (IL-7), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), and stem cell factor (SCF). The OP9-DL1 co-culture system enables the generation of functional CD3+ TCR+ iT cells in vitro (170). Interestingly, in in vivo models, the targeted knockout of Dll1 in the thymus does not affect T cell development (171). In contrast, Dll4 is an indispensable Notch1 ligand in T cell development (172). The key distinction between Dll1 and Dll4 is that Dll4 exhibits a higher binding capacity to the Notch1 receptor. Therefore, Dll4 appears to be more effective than Dll1 in activating Notch and initiating a T cell lineage at the early stages of T cell development (173). In the context of T lineage development from hiPSCs, OP9-DL1 as well as OP9-DL4 successfully supported the development of DP cells from hiPSCs with germline TCR genes (37, 174, 175). However, it’s worth noting that when TiPSC are used as a source on the OP9-DL1 system, there is no development of DP thymocytes and the regenerated iT cells do not express surface markers of cellular maturity such as CD5 and the CD8αβ dimer, while expressing CD8αα and CD56, indicative of an innate-like phenotype (34, 66, 90, 176). The pre-mature expression of the pre-rearranged TCRα genes during in vitro differentiation is responsible for this lineage skewing and use of stronger Notch activation though OP9-DL4 can restore the progress to the DP stage (63). Furthermore, this system has been used to generate functional iCAR T cells, exhibiting specific killing potential in in vitro and in vivo mouse models (34, 38, 66, 177). Similar to early TCRα expression, CAR signaling during differentiation hampers the development of DP and mature single positive CD8αβ iCAR T cells (63, 67, 68).",
        "In recent years, feeder-based systems have advanced to mimic better the thymus’s 3D structure, which plays a pivotal role in facilitating positive selection and improving human T cell development (178, 179). The artificial thymic organoid (ATO) platform closely mimics certain aspects of the 3D thymic structure. In this innovative approach, DLL1- or DLL4-expressing MS5 stromal cells are aggregated by centrifugation with mesodermal progenitors from hESC or hiPSC, creating a 3D environment conducive to T cell differentiation (36). The DLL1-expressing MS5 cells in ATO efficiently support the development of anti-CD19 CAR T cells derived from hiPSCs, preserving CAR expression and function. These hiPSC-derived CD19-CAR T cells exhibit comparable specific cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion and efficacy in controlling the progression of CD19+ leukemic cells in animal models when compared to PBMC CD19-CAR T cells (64). Interestingly, recent studies have highlighted the ATO system’s ability to induce the differentiation of CD4+ iT and iCAR T cells. Nevertheless, the functionality and potential of these CD4+ T cells remain subjects requiring further investigation (36, 68).",
        "As mentioned above to date, research grade approaches to differentiate hiPSCs toward HSPCs include either murine bone marrow-derived feeder cells in serum-containing medium (36, 37, 64, 153) or defined conditions with specific growth factors or cytokines via formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) (157, 180) or monolayer system (35, 181, 182) (see \nFigure 3\n). The first big step forward towards clinical production has been the generation of CD34+CD43− HSPC, with a serum-free and stroma cell-free protocol based on embryoid body formation and the use of specific cytokine and growth factor combinations in a stepwise manner by Kennedy et al. (2012) (180). Since then, EBs have been widely used to develop HSPC with diverse differentiation potential towards T cell (34, 63, 181, 183, 184). Although initial EB formation protocols relied on serum-containing media (185), more recent advancements have led to the development of xeno-free and serum-free media for use in these protocols (186–188). Differentiation approaches with defined conditions highly rely on the cytokine/growth factor cocktails used to prime the HSPC towards the preferred lineage, therefore important to be sure that required compounds are GMP grade available. As EBs are 3D aggregates containing a complex cellular composition, the hematopoietic progenitors need to be released from the EBs. Progenitor releasing involves enzymatic dissociation which can be harsh treatments affecting viability and further processes. After cell dissociation, CD34+ cells need to be enriched and isolated to proceed for further differentiation in an appropriate cGMP environment.",
        "Differentiation processes to generate iPSC-derived CAR T cells. The differentiation processes involved in generating iPSC-derived CAR T cells is depicted, highlighting the transition from research-level methods to those tailored for large production in clinical settings adhering to cGMP standards. At the research level, iPSCs are differentiated into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) using various methods, including embryoid bodies (EB), monolayer, and artificial thymic organoid (ATO) methods. The necessity of producing HSPCs on a defined, xeno-free, large scale clinical setting makes EB formation in bioreactor systems an attractive approach. While the monolayer differentiation protocol also follows cGMP standards, 2D large scale production might be more cumbersome. For T cell differentiation, murine feeder cells prove to be affective in research settings. Nevertheless, the development of a cGMP-compatible T cell differentiation methods demands the exclusion of xenogeneic antigens, leading to the use of a recombinant DL4 and VCAM1 protein-coated surface or human origin feeder cells. Notably, the protein-coated surface approach arises as an attractive strategy for large scale implementation culturing HSPCs together with coated microbeads in bioreactor systems to give rise to differentiated T cells. Created with BioRender.com.",
        "Possibly simpler, more efficient and cost-effective approaches to generate hematopoietic cells have been established using a feeder-free and serum-free monolayer method to derive HEPs with mature blood cell differentiation potential from iPSC (35). This monolayer method provides large numbers of high purity hematopoietic cells, removing the need of CD34 purification step for both fundamental research and most important for regenerative medicine in a cGMP manner.",
        "As mentioned earlier, conventional methods for further generating iT cells from the iPSC-derived HSPC have used various murine feeder cell lines, presenting significant challenges when designing manufacturing processes compliant with cGMP. Efforts have been made to explore the use of human feeder cells to support T cell development in vitro. The results of T cell differentiation in a co-culture of mouse primary fibroblast-DL4 and human HSCs were remarkable. In contrast, human primary fibroblasts expressing DL4 exhibited only minimal capacity to initiate early stages of T-cell development from human HSCs, even when macrophage colony-stimulating factor inhibitors were introduced (189). An alternative approach for establishing a human feeder cell system involved growing primary human fibroblasts and keratinocytes on a 3D scaffold, followed by seeding them with human CD34+ cells (190). This method holds promise for producing clinical-grade mature T cells in a laboratory setting. The outcomes of this co-culture revealed that fibroblasts and keratinocytes exhibited an increase in the expression of Dll4 and IL-7 during culture on the 3D scaffold, resulting in successful generation of single-positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing αβ TCR. However, the reproducibility of these results has not confirmed (191). Using human thymic epithelial cells (TECs) is another option for feeder cells. A previous study revealed that co-culture of cord blood CD34+ cells with a human immortalized TEC line overexpressed DL1 significantly facilitated T cell development and proliferation, progressing CD34+ cells to the DP stage. However, these differentiated cells did not proceed to the SP stage (192). A recent protocol has emerged involving the formation of thymic organoids by combining hPSC-derived thymic epithelial progenitors (TEPs), HPSCs, and mesenchymal cells. Within the 3D structure, hPSC-derived TEPs undergo further differentiation into TECs, and these cells can support T cell development in vitro, as demonstrated by the detection of αβTCR+ CD3+ cells after 4 weeks (193).",
        "Self-assembled 3D organoids have been employed in hematopoietic and T cell differentiation, aiming to closely mimic the in vivo microenvironment compared to traditional 2D cell cultures. However, 3D organoid models are inherently more complex than 2D cell cultures, posing challenges for standardization. Variability in organoid structures and compositions may impact reproducibility. Additionally, establishing and maintaining 3D organoid cultures can be technically demanding. Researchers may encounter difficulties in optimizing culture conditions, maintaining cell viability, and ensuring consistent outcomes. 3D bioprinting emerges as a promising method for modeling T cell development, offering advantages such as precise control over the spatial arrangement of cells and biomaterials and the ability to achieve a high level of complexity. However, compared to self-assembled 3D organoids, scaling up 3D bioprinting cultures for large-scale experiments can be challenging and requires specialized culture media and equipment. The resulting high costs and associated complexity may make this approach less suitable for mass production.",
        "While using human-origin feeder cells for T-cell generation from iPSCs has faced challenges due to disappointing efficiency and difficulties in scaling up the process, a feeder-free system has been developed for generating T cells from iPSCs. Recombinant DL4 alone has proven to be effective in promoting T cell differentiation from hiPSC. When recombinant DL4 is immobilized on a plate, it successfully generates functional antigen-specific CD3+ CD8+ T cells (65). Subsequent investigations have revealed that combining DL4 and VCAM1, an adhesion molecule for lymphoid cells, into a coating material enhanced the T cell potential of hematopoietic progenitors from hPSCs during the EHT stage, resulting in a substantial increase in the production of mature CD8+ T cells (184, 194). Additionally, employing a feeder-free approach, coupled with knocking down EZH1, the definitive hematopoietic fate repressor, yields a higher percentage of CD3+ iT cells and an increased number of differentiated iT cells (184). Finally, the scalable bioreactor for large-scale iT cell production method was established by using a DL4-immobilized bead (183, 195).",
        "Nevertheless, it is important to note that despite the success of feeder-free systems in generating functional SP CD8+ T cells, there successful generation of SP CD4+ T cells with helper functions is lagging. Prior studies induced positive selection in vitro using an anti-CD3 antibody to target the TCR complex in the presence of combinations of cytokines (65, 184, 194). Regrettably, these methods were unable to generate functional CD4+ T cells from hPSCs. A recent study introduced a novel method for inducing positive selection of iPSC-derived DP cells, by using low concentrations of PMA and ionomycin within the feeder-free system, resulting in the successful generation of SP CD4+ T cells. These CD4+ T cells can secrete signature cytokines of helper T cells, such as IL-2, IL-4 and TNF-α, upon activation but do not secrete IFN-γ. Furthermore, when these generated CD4+ T cells are cultured in a medium supplemented with TGF-β and IL-2, they undergo further differentiation into regulatory CD4+ T cells capable of suppressing T cell activation and proliferation in vitro (196).",
        "At research level EBs are maintained in static suspension cultures with limited potential for large scale production and control over cell aggregation and EB formation. Large scale EB formation and differentiation can be achieved in hydrodynamic conditions such as rotary orbital culture, rotating cell culture systems or bioreactor systems, which generally improves cell aggregation and a more homogenous EB formation compared to static methods (197, 198). Shaker flasks or roller bottles with constant circular motion provide a simple system for suspension based mixing environment improving the efficiency of EB formation. Although this technology lacks process control and scalability compared to other methods, it is helpful as a first attempt of scaling up while allowing comparison of different experimental parameters as various shakers and bottles can be accommodated on the rotary platform (197). A key parameter to control during dynamic cultures is the shear stress for the cells in culture as it will determine the cell clumping or dissociation of the cells. Rocking motion bioreactor and rotary cell culture systems are low-shear methods that drive continuous mixing and aeration, yielding high quality and yield EB culture. These systems are available as single use disposable bioreactors which make it advantageous to avoid issues around contaminations from reusable systems (197, 199–201). On the other side, spinner flask and vertical-wheel stirred bioreactors provide an attractive simple design, with scalable configuration, easy continuous monitoring and a flexible culture of cells as aggregated or on microcarriers/scaffolds (200, 201). The paddle impeller inside the bioreactor is responsible to continuously mix the medium having an impact on the cell viability and aggregate size of the culture. Cell aggregates like EBs or cells grown in microcarriers are more sensitive to shear stress than single cells. While low rate of stirring results in cell clumping supporting EB cultures, high rates can be harmful for the cells and dissociate (202). Studies to reach the optimal fluid velocity and promote a suitable shear stress is critical for scaling up in these systems.",
        "In contrast to EBs methods, which have a more straightforward adaptation to bioreactors, CD34 differentiation on a monolayer requires attachment of iPSC to a surface. Microcarriers are reported as a suitable biomaterial to culture cells in suspension instead of planar surface. Commercially available microcarriers differ in size, core and coating material, surface charges and porosity resulting in different cell seeding capacity and expansion. Therefore it is important to select the most efficient microcarrier for each large scale application by screening and assessing the seeding, proliferation, differentiation and harvesting efficiency of the cells of interest such as iPSC culture and CD34 differentiation in this case (203).",
        "To our knowledge, only one scalable approach for T cell differentiation using serum and feeder free protocol has been published (183) and patented (195). Streptavidin microbeads are coated with DL4 and cultured in suspension together with the developed hematopoietic progenitors and differentiating T cells. The best cells-to-beads ratio was assessed using G Rex Gas Permeable Rapid Cell Expansion Devices to successfully develop functional CD8αβ T cells. Other automated, closed, flexible integrated cell manufacturing platforms could also be considered, such as the Cocoon® (Lonza) or the CliniMACS Prodigy (Miltenyi), used already for conventional CAR T cell manufacturing, in order to increase control over the specific processes.",
        "Ensuring the quality, safety, and potency of the generated iPSC-derived T and CAR T cells is paramount for successful translational and clinical development. Robust release criteria, along with stringent safety and quality control measures, are essential to guarantee the therapeutic effectiveness and minimize potential risks (\nTable 2\n). Specific guidelines for CAR T cell therapy clinical release were added in 2021 in a revised version of the EMA Guideline on quality, nonclinical, and clinical aspects of medicinal products containing genetically modified cells and released in 2022 in the “Considerations for the Development of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-Cell Therapies” by the FDA. Release criteria for stem cell-based interventions must encompass qualified and validated assays that comprehensively assess various product attributes, including identity, purity, sterility, safety, and potency.",
        "Quality control and iT and iCAR T cell release criteria.",
        "Similarly to the abovementioned considerations for iPSCs maintenance, rigorous safety testing should be implemented for all production phases, encompassing assays to detect microbial and mycoplasma contamination, adventitious agents, replication-competent viruses, and potential genotoxicity. Sterility assessment involves the detection of microbial or fungal growth by turbidity assessment of the samples after incubation, or by newer and faster methods developed based on colorimetric, fluorescent or bioluminescence assays (e.g., BacT/Alert 3D® and BD BACTEC™ systems, Rapid Milliflex® Detection System) (204). PCR-based assays to detect mycoplasma are also being developed detecting conserved sequences like the bacterial 16S rRNA (205). In the case that integrating viral vectors are used for delivering of a transgene (CAR or other) then recommendations for Replication Competent Lentivirus (RCL) or Retrovirus (RCR) testing encompass evaluating all viral vector lots, manufactured cell products, and monitoring patients’ post-infusion (204, 206, 207). Also, the risk of insertional mutagenesis should be considered and factors influencing the risk include vector insertion profile, design with enhancer and promoter sequences, transgene product, and vector copy number (VCN) per transduced cell. Regulatory agencies mandate integration profile characterization to support marketing authorization applications. VCN per transduced cell analysis is a pivotal safety attribute, aiming to strike a balance between safety and efficacy. Typically, maintaining less than five copies per transduced cell is deemed safe, often assessed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) (208). Single-cell analysis, like droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), offers advantages in detecting cell-to-cell variability and identifying clones with higher integration counts, which may pose greater risks (209, 210). Besides, comprehensive genomic distribution and potential adverse effects of introduced genetic alterations is necessary to evaluate the long-term safety of the product. Techniques like next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be employed to analyze the integration profile of introduced transgenes and assess potential genomic alterations (209). Finally, detailed and sensitive biodistribution studies are essential for understanding how cells distribute throughout the body after administration, whether they are injected locally or systemically. Techniques such as qPCR and imaging modalities (such as bioluminescence imaging or positron emission tomography) can provide insights into the spatial distribution and persistence of administered cells over time (209).",
        "Identity testing should include assays to measure the presence of the transgens and immune-phenotyping of specific cellular populations. such as single positive CD4 or CD8 T cells, to confirm the product’s identity (204). Initiatives such as the Euroflow consortium and the Human Immuno-Phenotyping Consortium are working towards developing streamline and standardize immune-phenotyping assays, focusing on standard antibody panels, internal controls and automated analysis strategies (211, 212).",
        "Purity assessment involves quantifying the relative freedom from extraneous materials in the final product, including both process-related and product-related impurities. Quantitative limits of certain impurities coming from media, supplements, antibiotics or reagents in the final product need to be set. Regarding product-related impurities, given the potential heterogeneity of iPSC-derived products, special consideration is given to residual undifferentiated iPSC due to their potential to form teratomas. To identify residual undifferentiated iPSCs cellular marker panels targeting pluripotency-associated markers (such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG) can be utilized to detect and quantify them within the product (204). Release criteria for conventional CAR T cell products include % CD3 T cells but full characterization of the product is desirable. A minimum of 70% viability of the CAR T cell product is recommended by the FDA (205) and evaluation of bacterial endotoxin level by for example the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) method is mandatory (204). Finally, to consider the cryopreservation of the cell product where DMSO is used as excipient, however it is toxic if high volumes are infused together with the CAR T cell product. A safety limit for infusion was defined by the FDA as 1 mL/kg/day. Precise cell count and flow cytometry analysis of the CAR expression and cell populations in final product permits a precise assessment of the final dose (204).",
        "The allogeneic nature of iPSC-derived products as well as reports on aberrant protein expression by iPSC-derived products dictates for careful assessment of their potential for allo-immunization before clinical application (213). To date, there are no standardized assays for iT and iCAR T products. Tests analogous to those applied in assessing the immunogenicity of conventional CAR T cells can be extended to iCAR T cells. For example, ELISA and flow cytometry have proven effective in detecting existing antibodies specific to CAR proteins or other components from iCAR T cells (214) and standard mixed lymphocyte cultures can reveal cell-mediated reactions. The potential for de novo allo-immunization can be tested in non-human primate models (215).",
        "Preclinical studies should not only provide evidence of product safety but also establish proof-of-principle for therapeutic effects. Potency assessment is a critical component to ensure the function and consistency of cellular products, ensuring batch-to-batch uniformity. Customized assays aligned with product mechanisms and attributes are essential. Although standardized assays for CAR T-cells are yet to be widely established, in vitro cytotoxicity assays against target cells are commonly employed (204, 207, 216). In vivo assays face limitations due to variability of animal models and technical complexities. In vitro functional assays, such as cytotoxicity assays, provide insights into the product’s anti-tumor potential. Immunophenotyping, for example expression of phenotypic markers associated with T cell activation, exhaustion, and memory differentiation, could aid potency assessment by correlating phenotypes with efficacy. However, there isn’t a specific immunophenotypic profile currently identified as a direct predictor of CAR T-cell function in a validated quantitative assay. Indirect assays that measure a by-product of the effector–target interaction can also serve as an indicator of potency such as the secretion of cytokines and chemotoxins (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-a, IL-2, granzyme B) upon effector cell activation (217). Notably, FDA-approved products like Tisagenlecleucel and Axicaptagene Ciloleucel employ IFN-γ secretion as part of their potency assessment in response to CD19-expressing targets (204). However, when using IFN-γ detection via ELISA, it’s important to recognize that this reflects cytokine release from the entire incubated cell population, which could lead to an overestimation of CAR T-cell cytokine secretion (217). For a more targeted analysis, flow cytometry assays can intracellularly differentiate cytokine secretion among distinct cell types. This approach measures cytokine production rather than release. Additionally, as discussed by de Wolf et al. (2018) (217), effector-released cytokines can be measured at the single-cell level using enzyme-linked immunospot assays (ELISPot). Alternative methods, such as the FluoroSpot assay based on fluorophores, enable the precise detection of multiple cytokines per cell. Furthermore, the LysisPot platform employs target cell lines that express β-galactosidase, an enzyme released upon lysis. This technique enables the characterization of the CAR T-cell product’s direct cytotoxic activity and cytokine (IFN-γ) release at the single-cell level. Another strategy relies on correlating T-cell degranulation with killing activity. Following interaction with target cells, markers of T-cell activation and degranulation (e.g., CD107a) are expressed on the CAR T-cell surface, detectable via flow cytometry (217). Finally, CAR-T cell therapy efficacy in vivo can also be predicted by assessing the proliferation capacity of the cell upon target antigen recognition by assessing the incorporation of labelled-DNA thymidine or using fluorescent markers such as CFSE or other CellTrace kit (Thermofisher).",
        "Overall, the phenotypic and functional maturity of the generated iT and CAR iT cell effectors has to be ensured as well as an anti-tumor potential comparable with natural T cells. Moreover, as iPSC/derived CAR T cells are intended to provide an off the shelf therapy product, testing long term stability of the cryopreserved product as well as holding time after thawing is crucial to define it shelf life and ensure efficacy and safety upon infusion (218).",
        "In conclusion, the clinical production of iCAR T cells represents a remarkable leap forward in the field of cancer immunotherapy. The unique advantages offered by iPSCs, including their potential for greater compliance with good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards, scalability, and ease of genetic manipulation, underscore their importance as a source for CAR T cell generation. Moreover, the concept of universal iPSC clones, which can be standardized and quality-controlled in a manner akin to pharmaceutical production, holds tremendous promise for streamlining the manufacturing process and ensuring product consistency. However, it is clear that the journey towards clinical implementation is not without its challenges.",
        "The complexity of T cell development from iPSCs necessitates ongoing research and novel ideas to streamline and optimize the process. Notable advances have been made in the field of hematopoietic development, in establishing cGMP-compliant and scalable culturing and genetic engineering processes. This part is in many aspects common with the process of NK cell generation from iPSC (iNK), which is more straightforward thus, leading the more rapid clinical application of iNK cell products (NCT05182073, NCT05950334, NCT05336409). In contrast to the generation of NK cells from iPSC, the production of CAR iT cells has a multistep nature, involving various stages from iPSC establishment to hematopoietic and T cell differentiation and multiple potential endpoint T cell phenotypes (CD8, CD4, cytotoxic or regulatory), thus, presenting logistical challenges that demand innovative solutions. To make this therapy more clinically applicable, efforts must focus on manufacturing improvements, such as closed-system processes, enhanced scalability, and process optimization, all of which can contribute to improved affordability and accessibility for patients. A promising direction in this endeavor involves transitioning from modular production systems for each cell process (iPSC, hematopoietic progenitors and T cells) to preferentially adopting all-in-one systems, which can simplify the workflow, reduce production timelines, and enhance the overall efficiency of iPSC-derived CAR T cell manufacturing. This paradigm shift aligns with the overarching goal of expanding the reach of CAR T cell therapy to a broader patient population as an off the shelf therapy.",
        "In summary, while challenges persist, the ongoing advancements in CAR iT cell production and first-in-human clinical application (NCT04629729) offer a tantalizing glimpse into a future where innovative treatments are more accessible, affordable, and effective, paving the way for improved outcomes in cancer immunotherapy.",

    "title": "Limbal stem cell therapy. cell (LSC) therapies for the treatment of limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). RECENT FINDINGS: Direct LSC transplantation have demonstrated good long-term outcomes. Cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET) has been an alternative to treat severe to total LSCD aiming to improve the safety and efficacy of the LSC transplant. A prospective early-stage uncontrolled clinical trial shows the feasibility and safety of CLET manufactured under xenobiotic free conditions. Other cell sources for repopulating of the corneal epithelium such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells are being investigated. The first clinical trials of using MSCs showed short-term results, but long-term efficacy seems to be disappointing. A better understanding of the niche function and regulation of LSC survival and proliferation will lead to the development of medical therapies to rejuvenate the residual LSCs found in a majority of eyes with LSCD in vivo. Prior efforts have been largely focused on improving LSC transplantation. Additional effort should be placed on improving the accuracy of diagnosis and staging of LSCD, and implementing standardized outcome measures which enable comparison of efficacy of different LSCD treatments for different severity of LSCD. The choice of LSCD treatment will be customized based on the severity of LSCD in the future. SUMMARY: New approaches for managing different stages of LSCD are being developed. This concise review summarizes the progresses in LSC therapies for LSCD, underlying mechanisms, limitations, and future areas of development. Paris, France. USA. 10.1097/ICU.0000000000001061.

      "abstract": "Purpose To identify structural landmarks in the limbal stroma by anterior segment optical coherence tomography (asOCT), asOCT angiography (asOCTa) and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), and correlate findings with immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM). Methods The corneal limbus of healthy individuals was examined by IVCM, asOCT, and asOCTa. IFM was performed in cadaveric cornea samples sectioned in clinical imaging planes, with putative markers for limbal niche cells (CD90, N -cadherin, SSEA-4), blood/lymphatic vessels (CD31), nerves (acetyl-α-tubulin, β-III tubulin), limbal epithelial progenitor cells (p63), and hyaluronic acid (HA). Results On asOCT, asOCTa, and IVCM superficial and deep limbal vessels could be identified that terminated in the marginal corneal arcade (MCA). Limbal stroma appeared as hyperreflective area between superficial and deep limbal blood vessels. The same blood vessel patterns were identified by IFM. HA localization was identical to hyperreflective stromal structures. Nerves and putative niche cells localized around limbal vessels and were in close contact with the basal limbal epithelium at the level of the MCA. Limbal epithelium was hyperreflective and thinned in the elderly (>60 years, 122.6 ± 36.6 µm; <60 years, 139.9 ± 34.4 µm; P = 0.025) resulting in less visible palisades of Vogt on asOCT (>60 years, 82.6% visible; <60 years, 100% visible; P = 0.011). Conclusions Our study proves that limbal vessel plexuses can serve as landmarks to identify corresponding structures in various clinical imaging modalities. The proximity of blood vessels, niche cells, and nerves, confirmed by IFM, may suggest that limbal vascular damage occurs together with niche cell and neural loss.

        "Corneal epithelium is continuously regenerated from the limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs).1 Damage to limbal structures leads to limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), resulting in corneal neovascularization and loss of transparency that may lead to corneal blindness.2 The cornerstone of total LSCD therapy is limbal stem cell transplantation (LSCT).3,4 Recent studies have shown that combined transplantation of limbal stromal (niche) cells and limbal epithelial progenitor cells onto the damaged corneal surface has a higher success rate and results in a greater degree of clarity compared to epithelial transplantation alone.5,6 This emphasizes the importance of limbal stromal structures and the need for their examination in both healthy and pathological conditions.",
        "LESCs are located in the basal limbal epithelium and epithelial crypts of the palisades of Vogt (PoV).7–9 The PoV consist of stromal ridges and finger-like projections with interposing epithelial rete pegs that form deep epithelial crypts at specific locations.10,11 The entire structure of the limbal palisades, encompassing both epithelial and stromal parts, is referred to as the limbal epithelial stem cell niche.12,13 Mesenchymal cells supporting the limbal epithelial stem cells (niche cells) are found more superficially in the limbal stroma,14 and limbal stromal stem cells appear in deeper layers.15 It is presumed that the integrity of both the epithelial and stromal structures is equally important in maintaining the corneal epithelium.16 PoV structures can be observed with slit-lamp examination in most subjects,17,18 occupying an approximately 2-mm area in the upper and lower limbus. PoV begin just posteriorly to the limbal terminal capillary loops (marginal corneal arcade [MCA]) and extend up to the epithelial projection of the Schlemm canal/scleral spur (histological limbus) (Fig. 1).19,20 Structures surrounding the MCA and the anterior part of the PoV form the corneal limbus (CoL), whereas the part above the sclera forms the scleral limbus (ScL).11,18",

        "Although corneal surface impression cytology remains the gold standard for diagnosing LSCD, its clinical utility is limited by sampling difficulties and the need for laboratory processing.21 Slit-lamp examination can be used to assess clinical signs of LSCD, such as the extent of corneal staining and neovascularization.22 Recently, some parameters (e.g., basal epithelial cell density, features of subbasal corneal nerves, central epithelial thickness) measured on in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (asOCT) examinations were reported to enable a more accurate assessment of LSCD.23",
        "However, these examinations detect changes in the epithelial structures, and clinical examination of the limbal stroma remains less established. It has been observed that IVCM examination is a promising tool to visualize hyperreflective limbal structures containing CD90/CD105-positive mesenchymal cells.24 Advances in spectral-domain OCT technology (e.g., increased speed and resolution of asOCT imaging) have enabled precise examination of PoV structures.12,25 PoV are arranged around the limbal vessels, and asOCT angiography (asOCTa) has been used to assess limbal vasculature in normal and abnormal corneal states.26,27",

Our focus was primarily on asOCT examination, as its larger field of view and fast, non-contact mode are advantageous, especially in LSCD patients with damaged corneas. First, we compared asOCT and asOCTa images to IVCM. To better understand structural and functional relationships, we correlated the findings with correspondingly oriented corneal immunohistology sections.

This device utilizes an 840-nm laser source and is capable of capturing 70,000 A-scans per second, with an axial resolution of 5 µm and a lateral resolution of 15 µm. Each person had three, 8-mm crossline scans. Longitudinal scans were used for measurements. Limbal epithelial depth was measured at the deepest point of the epithelial rete peg, and the length of the PoV was measured between the Bowman's layer and the epithelial projection of the scleral spur. The deepest of the limbal epithelial measurements was considered for statistical analyses. Mean limbal length was calculated using three separate measurements. The Solix system with the CAM-L adaptor lens was used for structural analysis of the limbus due to its high-quality images. This device is equipped with an 840-nm laser source, captures 120,000 A-scans per second, and has an 18-µm lateral resolution and a 5-µm axial resolution. The 8-mm “cornea line” images were captured with 1700 A-scans per line at 0° and 90°. “Cornea cube” 4 × 4-mm images were taken with 256 evenly spaced (15.6 µm) horizontal B-scans per cube and 513 A-scans per line.",
        "The Avanti XR system was utilized for asOCTa. The 6 × 6-mm HR retina angiography scans were performed in each corneal quadrant. For angiography, an anterior segment lens was used, and the focal length was adjusted to ensure clear visibility of the limbal vessels on red-free images. Built-in retinal angiography software was utilized for segmentation. The segmentation depths were adjusted based on the findings in the flow signals observed on cross-sectional OCT images.",
        "IVCM was performed with a Heidelberg HRT3 device (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) on superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal limbal regions. The volume scan method was used with the scan depth adjusted to encompass the entire limbal epithelial and stromal thickness.",
        "Parameters of the PoV groups were compared with t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the post hoc Tukey test. The χ2 and Fisher exact tests were used to compare the ratios of non-visible PoV and PoV types in age groups. Statistics concerning age-related changes and female/male differences involved only inferior limbal data. Prism (GraphPad, Boston, MA, USA) was used to carry out the analyses.",
        "Cadaveric corneas unsuitable for corneal transplantation were requested from the Department of Pathology, University of Debrecen, with permission of the regional ethical committee. The human tissue experiments complied with the guidelines of the ARVO Best Practices for Using Human Eye Tissue in Research. Corneas from three cadaveric donors were utilized for immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM). Data for the corneas used are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Each cornea was cut into 1/4 segments, embedded into Cryomatrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), frozen in liquid isopentane submerged into liquid nitrogen, then stored at −80°C. Longitudinal, cross-sectional, and en face sections of the limbal PoV (10–15 µm) were placed on electrostatically charged slides (SuperFrost Ultra Plus; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sections were fixed in ice-cold acetone and dried in air. Before immunofluorescence staining, sections were rehydrated in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% nonionic detergent (Triton X-100; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Some of the sections were digested with 20 U/mL Streptomyces hyaluronidase (H1136; Sigma-Aldrich) with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini; Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Incubation time for digestion was between 20 minutes and 1 hour at 37°C, depending on the sizes of the samples. Hyaluronidase digestion was terminated by washing with PBS three times and 1% formaldehyde fixation. The samples were incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The primary and secondary antibodies used for immunohistology are described in Supplementary Table S2.",
        "The slides were washed three times in 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS and then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in 50 µL of secondary antibody cocktail. After checking with all relevant fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls that there was no interspecies cross-binding between primary and secondary antibodies, controls labeled with all relevant secondary antibodies were prepared for every staining experiment. Sections processed identically but with labels omitted were examined for tissue autofluorescence. All samples were washed three times in 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 minutes, and washed again three times, and the cell nuclei were counterstained with 70 µL of 1 µg/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 minutes in the second washing buffer. Sections were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA).",
        "Imaging of immunostained histological sections was carried out with a Pannoramic Confocal digital pathology scanner (3DHISTECH, Budapest, Hungary) with multiplexed confocal fluorescent detection, described earlier.28 The built-in autofocus algorithm was used with a 20× Plan-Apochromat objective (numerical aperture = 0.8; Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany). Thirteen confocal slices were imaged with an 800-nm step size. Average intensity projection of the stacks is shown in the overview images (Figs. 3a, 4a, 4d, 5a, 6a, 7a). The three-dimensional (3D) stacks were analyzed in detail using a SlideViewer (3DHISTECH) application, and regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen for further superresolution imaging.",
        "The ROIs selected in whole slides were imaged with a confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with an Airyscan detector (Carl Zeiss Microscopy). Depending on ROI size, the detector was used in either superresolution or multiplex mode. DAPI was excited at 405 nm and detected within the 420- to 480-nm range. Alexa Fluor 488 and fluorescein were excited with a 488-nm laser and detected between 495 and 560 nm. Alexa Fluor 546 and 555 were excited at 543 nm and detected between 555 and 630 nm. Alexa Fluor 647 was excited at 633 nm and detected through a 660-nm long-pass filter. Every ROI was imaged with optimal sampling in its full X,Y,Z dimensions. Voxel dimensions were X,Y = 41 nm and Z = 191 nm for superresolution and X,Y = 82 nm and Z = 230 nm for multiplex imaging.",
        "AsOCTa composite images revealed a dense network of blood vessels in the conjunctiva and in the ScL and fine hairpin vessel loops in the CoL (Fig. 1e). The straight vessels of PoV were seen superficially, showing interconnecting branches at the limbal margin. From these branches, numerous tiny, barely detectable loops ran toward the cornea, forming the MCA. Vessels of the MCA were rarely visualized as loops; mostly only sections of these small vessels were seen (Fig. 1i).",
        "Underneath the straight PoV vessels, Y-shaped episcleral vessels were seen. These Y-shaped vessels were found to be collected in the episcleral arcade and directed toward the sclera, forming a second, less complete vascular arcade (Fig. 1j). Flow signals on corresponding cross-sectional angiography images showed that hyporeflective lines (longitudinal) or dot-like structures (cross-sections) with shadowing effect corresponded to corneal vessels on asOCT structural scans (Figs. 1c–e, 1h).",
        "A detailed examination of the PoV was performed with the Optovue Solix asOCT and yielded high-quality longitudinal, cross-sectional, and en face (3D) images. Based on the asOCTa results, the hyporeflective features with underlying shadowing effect were considered as blood vessels. On longitudinal high-resolution asOCT images (Fig. 1k), limbal stroma appeared as a hyperreflective zone between the limbal epithelium and the episcleral vessels. In the scleral limbus, limbal stroma appeared as a continuation of the subconjunctival stroma, often accompanied by a longitudinal PoV vessel. This PoV vessel merged anteriorly with episcleral vessels. A wedge-shaped hyperreflective band was seen at the corneal part of the PoV with some small hyporeflective linear structures representing the MCA capillaries (Fig. 1k).",
        "Episcleral vessels appeared slightly larger than PoV vessels. Cross-sections of their arcades were occasionally observed approximately 3 mm away from the edge of Bowman's layer. These arcades represent the boundary of the anterior scleral attachment of Tenon's capsule, which appeared somewhat less hyperreflective (Fig. 1k).",
        "Cross-sections of PoV at the CoL revealed comb-like hyperreflective stromal projections, each with a hyporeflective dot at its base, which could be distinguished from the similar but larger episcleral vessels. (Figs. 1c, 1d, 2b) At the posterior end of the scleral limbus, the subepithelial hyperreflective stroma could easily be distinguished from the underlying less hyperreflective Tenon's capsule. In the extensions of the longitudinal rete pegs at the ScL, most subjects had epithelial islands present, which could be identified on matching longitudinal sections. These structures may represent limbal crypts (Supplementary Fig. S1).",
        "OCT, IVCM, and immunohistology sections in corresponding planes of limbal structures. (a–c) High-resolution anterior segment OCT images of a human corneal limbal area in three different directions: longitudinal (a), transversal (b), and en face (c). Drawings in the bottom show the direction of the image plane above them (in histological sections, upper and lower limbus were not distinguished). (d–j) In vivo confocal microscopy images—en face (d) and insets (g)—of a human corneal upper limbus. Corresponding immunofluorescence microscopy images are in directions identical to the asOCT and IVCM images: longitudinal (e, h), transversal (f, i), and en face (g, j). Sections were stained with labeled hyaluronic acid binding protein (HABP) to show the presence of HA (red) which localizes in the same position as the hyperreflective stroma seen in the asOCT and IVCM images (e–g). Hyaluronidase treatment depleted HABP staining (h–j), verifying the specificity of HABP binding. The green signal shows the blood vessels (positive for CD31). The vessels became more prominent after hyaluronidase treatment (h–j). The vessels formed a deep, episcleral plexus (yellow arrows) and a superficial plexus (blue arrows). These vessels can be observed in asOCT and IVCM images, as well (a–d, and insets in g, where yellow arrows indicate deep vessels and blue arrows indicate superficial vessels). HA is more abundant around superficial and deep blood vessels than in the limbal stroma located in between them. The red signal also highlights the finger-like structures of the PoV, in both cross-sectional (f) and en face (g) images. The limbal epithelium is stained with anti-pancytokeratin antibodies and appears blue. Limbal epithelial crypts can be seen on the longitudinal sections (e, h) and in the en face OCT (c) and IVCM (d) views of PoV, and are marked with white asterisk. Scale bar: 500 µm (e, h); 200 µm (f, g, i, j).",
        "En face scans reconstructed from 3D cube scans displayed the presence of PoV as alternating hyper- and hyporeflective structures at a depth of 60 to 110 µm (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. S1). Results of statistical analysis of PoV measurements are summarized in the Table. Limbal epithelial thickness was significantly higher in the superior and inferior limbus than the nasal or temporal limbus. Superior and inferior limbal epithelial thicknesses were not significantly different. PoV were significantly longer in the superior limbus. Because PoV structures were barely or not visible in the nasal and temporal limbus even in younger (<60 years) individuals (5/12 and 2/12, respectively), and upper eyelid shadowing made superior limbus examination difficult in the elderly, inferior limbus measurements were used to compare age- and sex-related changes in a larger cohort. The limbal epithelium was significantly thinner above the age of 60 years compared with younger individuals (122.6 ± 36.6 µm vs. 139.9 ± 34.4 µm, respectively; P = 0.025). Males had deeper PoV than females, but the difference was not statistically significant (135.3 ± 39,8 µm vs. 121.1 ± 34,9 µm, respectively; P = 0.1072). The proportion of individuals with no visible inferior PoV was significantly higher above the age of 60 years than in younger individuals (82.6% vs. 100% visible, respectively; P = 0.011), indicating that age-related changes occur in the palisade structures. Decreased visibility of PoV can be the consequence of flattened stromal projections (Supplementary Fig. S2j), as well as a more hyperreflective, conjunctiva-like limbal epithelium (Supplementary Fig. S2m). PoV showed individual patterns in each patient. There could be differences seen in the PoV patterns between the upper and lower limbus (6/23 eyes, 26%), as well as between the contralateral eyes of the same subjects (2/11 subjects, 18%).",
        "Statistical Analysis of the Maximum Epithelial Thickness, Length, Visibility, and Morphological Types of PoV",
        "Maximum epithelial thickness, length, and visibility of PoV were analyzed as a function of age, sex, laterality, and PoV type using measurements of the inferior PoV of 102 eyes and as a function of localization using maximum values of minimally triplicate measurements of each quadrant in 12 eyes of six healthy volunteers < 60 years of age. The distribution of PoV type was compared between young and elderly, male and female, and left and right eyes. Significant differences are highlighted in bold. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.",
        "Patterns could be categorized into three major groups—straight parallel PoV, reticular form, and finger-like projections (FLPs)—with distinguishable appearance on IVCM, en face asOCT, and asOCTa (Supplementary Fig. S2). Statistical analysis revealed that epithelial rete pegs were significantly deeper in the straight parallel PoV than in the reticular or the finger-like groups (P = 0.0095 and P = 0.0347, respectively). PoV lengths did not differ significantly among the groups (Table). The proportion of inferior PoV patterns was significantly different in age groups (P = 0.0127), with a linear pattern being most prevalent in those under age 60 years and a reticular pattern above 60 years of age. No FLP pattern was observed in men, but this may be due to the low case number.",
        "On IVCM volume scans of the CoL, sharp, hyperreflective nerve bundles and tiny looping vessels were seen, surrounded by round cells and hyperreflective stroma. Hyperreflective stromal projections with alternating epithelial rete pegs were observed in the ScL, and each stromal projection had a small, central blood vessel (Fig. 2g, insets; Supplementary Figs. S3, S4). Individual variations were observed similarly to what was seen on the en face asOCTs (Supplementary Fig. S2). In the deep layer, a hyperreflective stroma was seen that contained parallel fibers and large vessels, whereas cell nuclei or nerve bundles were barely distinguishable (Supplementary Fig. S4i). Some rete pegs penetrated deeply into the stroma where they formed crypts.",
        "The location of the hyperreflective stroma of PoV seen on IVCM and asOCT corresponded to the location of stromal hyaluronic acid (HA) in immunohistology. In transverse and longitudinal sections, HA-rich stroma appeared underneath the epithelium and episclerally. Weaker staining was observed in areas between these two layers. These weakly stained areas were identified as the anterior attachment of Tenon's capsule in asOCT images. Deep limbal vessels running on the episcleral surface and superficial vessels running in PoV stromal projections were visible as CD31+ structures in the HA-rich stroma with patterns similar to those in asOCTa and asOCT images. The absence of staining after hyaluronidase digestion confirmed the presence of HA in these structures (Fig. 2).",
        "To examine the localization of putative niche cells, immunohistological staining was performed for molecules previously described as putative niche markers. CD90-postitive cells were seen around the deeper blood vessels and in association with the subepithelial capillaries. Subepithelial CD90+ cells had an elongated appearance, and were in close contact with limbal basal epithelial cells (Fig. 3).",

        "Although their significance is well known, clinical examination of the stromal elements of the limbal niche remains an understudied and unresolved issue. The goal of this study was to compare images from currently available clinical imaging methods such as asOCTa, asOCT and IVCM with each other and with limbal immunohistology sections cut in the planes corresponding to the imaging planes of these devices (i.e., en face, longitudinal and cross sections) and visualize niche components and cells to better understand clinical images. Palisades of Vogt are the main structural elements and similarly to Miri and Lathrop we found significant individual variation in PoV patterns.11,29 We confirmed earlier OCT findings of decreased limbal epithelial thickness in the elderly30,31 and found that longitudinal palisades were significantly deeper than other patterns, which underlies that consideration of individual characteristics is necessary in limbal examinations.32 To our best knowledge, we confirmed in vivo for the first time the ex vivo observations of Notara et a.33, about changing PoV patterns in the elderly. Non-visible palisades in the elderly are due to flattened stromal projections as well as hyperreflective, conjunctiva-like limbal epithelium. Recently spatiotemporal single cell analysis34 proved age-related centripetal migration of corneal cells and limbal conjunctivalization, that are confirmed in vivo by our findings.",
        "We showed that, on both IVCM and asOCTa/asOCT, the limbal stroma appears as a hyperreflective structure. Similarly to previous studies, we found that identification of MCA was often limited on asOCTa images.35 A slower blood flow velocity in MCA than in retinal capillaries may explain this difficulty.36 Other factors, such as movement artifacts, and difficulty in adjusting segmentation planes in limbal scans in asOCTa images intended for retinal examinations may also cause problems.37 Nevertheless, in good-quality images, segmentation was possible. Upper straight and lower Y-shaped vessels, unifying at the level of PoV and giving rise to MCA running subepithelially at the corneal margin, could be identified. Flow signals in asOCTa structural images indicated that blood vessels could be identified as hyporeflective lines in longitudinal images and as dots in cross-sectional OCT images. On high-resolution asOCT structural images, a hyperreflective stromal band followed the course of both subconjunctival and episcleral vessels and merged at the anterior part of the PoV to form a wedge-shaped hyperreflective zone that surrounded the MCA vessels. These findings are in agreement with earlier works26,38,39; however, our detailed analysis of longitudinal and cross-sectional OCT images allowed a more accurate identification of limbal structures.",
        "Our analysis was further enhanced by comparison to whole-slide and superresolution immunohistological images. In immunohistology, CD31+ blood vessels were seen in exactly the same pattern as in asOCTa and the hyporeflective lines and dots with shadowing effect shown by asOCT. It appeared that blood vessels were surrounded by HA-rich stroma. HA was shown in the limbus earlier, mostly as bundles running parallel with limbal vessels.40 It has also been shown that HA is essential for maintaining the SC function in the limbus.41 A HA-containing molecular complex named HC-HA/PTX3 was observed in the amniotic membrane and was suggested to participate in the anti-inflammatory and stem cell–supporting functions of the amniotic membrane.42 Based on the high degree of morphological identity, we posit that high HA content can confer hyperreflectivity to the limbal stroma via the high water binding capacity of HA.",
        "We also found that large nerve bundles ran together with deep Y-shaped limbal vessels whereas fine fibers ran parallel with the superficial capillaries of the PoV. Deep vessels are surrounded by a network of acetyl-α-tubulin–containing nerve fibers, indicating a strong neuroregulation of these vessels. Earlier, sympathetic nerves were shown around limbal vessels, and acetyl-α-tubulin was shown in the stable microtubule structure of axons, thus we suggest that acetyl-α-tubulin highlights sympathetic nerve axons.43,44 We also examined the localization of cells positive for molecules so far associated with putative limbal niche cells (LNCs) and LESCs.",
        "CD90+ cells were observed in the proximity of both deep and superficial vessels, and at the level of MCA vessels they localized directly underneath limbal basal cells; the same localization was recently shown by Polisetti et al.14 SSEA4+ cells were rare; some were localized around deep vessels but others were subepithelial cells that had contact with SSEA+ epithelial cells. These subepithelial cells were also positive for N-cadherin and contained only patches of SSEA4, suggesting the possibility that these cells made contact with epithelial SSEA4+ processes and that the cells themselves did not contain SSEA4. On the other hand, SSEA4+ cells in the deeper stroma were close to blood vessels, were highly positive for SSEA4, and were round shaped. Earlier, Truong et al.45 showed that SSEA4+ limbal epithelial cells exhibited differentiation markers and had less colony forming potential than SSEA4– limbal epithelial cells. On the other hand, pluripotent SSEA4+ stromal cells were isolated from the limbal stroma after collagenase digestion by several groups,46–48 and we assume that SSEA+ deep stromal round cells may correspond to pluripotent limbal stromal cells and represent a population different from SSEA4+ epithelial cells.",
        "N-cadherin is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that plays a role in a multitude of cellular functions, including neural crest cell migration, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and blood vessel formation.49 It is expressed in fibroblasts, neural cells, blood vessel endothelial cells, and melanocytes.50–52 In the limbus, N-cadherin was found in putative LESCs and melanocytes53 and later shown in organoids produced from collagenase-digested limbal tissues.5 It has also been shown that N-cadherin expression on feeder 3T3 cells is required to maintain N-cadherin+ epithelial stem cells.53 Xie et al.48 isolated limbal niche cells that were positive for both SSEA4 and N-cadherin. We found N-cadherin in limbal vessel walls, as well as elongated limbal stromal cells and melanocytes of the basal limbal epithelium. N-cadherin+ stromal cells extended their processes to the basal limbal epithelial layer, where p63+/N-cadherin+ putative LESCs were present, indicating that in the limbus N-cadherin function is necessary to establish communication between LESCs and underlying fibroblastic cells.53",
        "In summary, we showed that putative niche cells positive for CD90, SSEA4, and N-cadherin are located around limbal vessels, together with nerve fibers in HA-rich stroma, which can be observed as hyperreflective subepithelial limbal stroma on IVCM and asOCT examinations. The anatomical proximity of these structural components suggests that they can be considered as functional units in both healthy and damaged limbuses. One important use of asOCT and asOCTa today is in the assessment of limbal damage after ocular burns. The severity and classification of corneal damage after burns are based mainly on the extent of visible limbal blood vessel loss.54,55 Our observations of the intimate proximity of blood vessels and nerves in the limbal niche indicate that damage to limbal blood vessels not only causes limbal ischemia but may also indicate direct damage to niche cells and nerves. In accordance with this assumption, a recent study showed that exposure to high-dose nitrogen mustard was followed by immediate inflammatory destruction of limbal structures that resulted in limbal nerve damage and LESC loss along with corneal neovascularization.56",
        "The cornea is normally avascular, and blood vessels exceeding the limbal margin are considered as neovascularization (NV). In LSCD, conjunctival vessels invade the corneal surface, due to lack of limbal barrier, whereas deep stromal NV can result from infections or inflammatory reactions after injury.57 The extent and depth of corneal neovascularization examined by asOCTa were reported to be helpful in the diagnosis and staging of LSCD.54 However, currently asOCTa has limitations57; in our experience, detection of small vessels of the PoV requires especially good cooperation from patients. The ratios of epithelial to stromal reflectivity on asOCT have been sufficient for diagnosing total LSCD, without adding information on vascular density gained from asOCTa.58 In our study, segmentation of limbal superficial, deep, and MCA vessels and then identifying them as hyporeflective shadowing lines on asOCT longitudinal and cross-sections allowed identifying the same vascular structures on immunofluorescence and IVCM images and correlating them to each other. For therapeutic decisions in LSCD, the detection of intact PoV structures in the damaged limbus before therapy59 or during follow up after regenerative interventions60,61 may be very important. This can be done by IVCM61,62; however, more recently the use of non-contact and faster asOCT was introduced.59 Emerging technologies such as full-field and line-scanning spectral-domain OCT that possess the advantages of both methods (cellular resolution and non-contact)63 are able to detect vascular flow and its direction64 and may improve diagnostic possibilities in the future. However, until these novel technologies become widely available, the use of asOCT as a faster non-contact method can be considered as the first choice for limbal diagnostics and supplemented with IVCM if high-resolution imaging is needed.",
        "To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that correlates findings of multimodal clinical examination of the limbal stroma with detailed immunohistological analysis. The insights gained from this study facilitate the identification of structural landmarks that delineate the components of the limbal stroma upon clinical examination by asOCT/asOCTa and IVCM and translate cellular-level information to clinical information. By comparing immunohistology images with those of non-invasive diagnostic techniques, a better understanding of clinical images is possible that is a prerequisite for recognizing and diagnosing pathological changes. The limitations of this study are the relatively low number of examined subjects, the involvement of only Caucasian, low-pigmented individuals, and the use of a limited number of cadaveric corneas for immunohistology.",

CD19 and B-cell maturation antigen have become an approved standard of care worldwide for relapsed and refractory B-cell malignancies. If CAR-T cell therapy for non-hematological malignancies is to achieve the same stage of clinical development, then iterative early-phase clinical testing can add value to the clinical development process for evaluating CAR-T cell products containing different CAR designs and manufactured under differing conditions. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 trial of third-generation GD2-specific CAR-T cell therapy, which has previously been tested in neuroblastoma patients. In this study, the GD2-CAR-T therapy was evaluated for the first time in metastatic melanoma patients in combination with BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy, and as a monotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer and a patient with fibromyxoid sarcoma. Feasibility and safety were determined and persistence studies, multiplex cytokine arrays on sera and detailed immune phenotyping of the original CAR-T products, the circulating CAR-T cells, and, in select patients, the tumor-infiltrating CAR-T cells were performed. RESULTS: We demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing CAR-T products at point of care for patients with solid cancer and show that a single intravenous infusion was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities or severe adverse events. In addition, we note significant improvements in CAR-T cell immune phenotype, and expansion when a modified manufacturing procedure was adopted for the latter 6 patients recruited to this 12-patient trial. We also show evidence of CAR-T cell-mediated immune activity and in some patients expanded subsets of circulating myeloid cells after CAR-T cell therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of third-generation GD2-targeting CAR-T cells in patients with metastatic melanoma and other solid cancers such as colorectal cancer, showing feasibility, safety and immune activity, but limited clinical effect.

        "This study suggests that robust CAR-T cell activity engenders protumorigenic myeloid cells, thus constraining effective CAR-T cell therapy, and further identifies the need to improve GD2-CAR-T cell therapy by both refining patient selection and CAR vector design.",
        "Clinical and preclinical research in the field of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies has exploded in the last decade. Alongside clinical development of CD19-targeted CAR-T cell therapy of renowned success was CAR-T cell therapy targeting the glycolipid antigen GD2.1 GD2 is a disialoganglioside expressed in tumors of neuroectodermal origin, and a tumor antigen of significant interest with elevated expression reported in neuroblastoma, melanoma, retinoblastoma, gliomas, small cell lung cancer, and sarcoma including Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma.2–6 The GD2-targeting monoclonal antibody dinutuximab is US Food and Drug Administration approved as part of postconsolidation therapy for neuroblastoma patients.7",
        "The first generation of GD2-CAR-T cell therapy was developed at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, Texas, USA), and the CAR incorporated the 14g2a-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) with the CD3ζ signaling domain. This CAR construct was introduced into Epstein-Barr virus-specific or activated T cells using a retroviral vector. The resulting GD2-CAR-T cells were tested in 19 neuroblastoma patients.8 Five patients with active disease showed tumor responses or necrosis, with three patients demonstrating complete responses. Of note, progression-free survival was strongly correlated with persistence of GD2-CAR T cells beyond 6 weeks, even though these cells were only present long term at low levels. Prolonged GD2-CAR T cell persistence in peripheral blood was associated with the presence of both CD4+T cells and central memory T cells in the infused product. Although the aim of employing virus-specific T cells in this study was to provide physiological T-cell stimulation, costimulation required for T-cell survival, expansion and cytotoxic activity may also be provided by adding appropriate signaling domains to the CAR construct.9 10",
        "In a comparative preclinical study of CD3zeta, CD28-CD3zeta and CD28-OX40-CD3zeta endodomains of GD2-specific CAR, the CD28-OX40-CD3zeta construct optimized the proliferation, survival and cytolytic capacity of transgenic T cells.10 The sustained cytotoxic functions of the CD28-OX40-CD3zeta containing GD2-CAR manifested as significant antitumor effects of GD2-CAR gene-modified human T cells in a murine model of GD2-expressing human melanoma metastases.9 Importantly, melanoma cell killing by these GD2-CAR gene-modified T cells occurred even when GD2 expression was relatively low.9",
        "These third-generation GD2-CAR-T cells (referred to in this study as GD2-iCAR-PBT; in recognition of the (i)nducible caspase 9 suicide gene encoded upstream of the CAR domain) have been tested in the GRAIN trial for neuroblastoma patients (NCT01822652).11 In the GRAIN trial, 11 patients were treated in three non-randomized cohorts: Cohort 1—GD2-iCAR-PBT alone, cohort 2—GD2-iCAR-PBT with prior cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (Cy/Flu) lymphodepletion chemotherapy, and cohort 3—Cy/Flu conditioning, GD2-iCAR-PBT, and the programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, pembrolizumab. GD2-iCAR-PBT persistence was limited and responses of progressive disease or disease stabilization were observed. Infusions were well tolerated and neurological adverse events (AEs) in these patients were minimal, despite the known low-level expression of GD2 by neurons and the documented peripheral neurotoxicity of the GD2-targeting monoclonal antibody.12 Other findings were that lymphodepletion chemotherapy contributed significantly to CAR-T cell expansion, but not the addition of pembrolizumab, and that a blood subpopulation of presumably immunosuppressive CD45/CD33/CD11b/CD163+myeloid cells also expanded in all patients after the CAR-T cell infusion. Recently, a trial of 13 osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma patients using an identical third-generation CAR was reported. This GD2-CAR-T cell therapy showed no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and disease stabilization in 10 of 12 patients13 and a myeloid signature associated with poor CAR-T cell expansion was also identified.",
        "GD2-specific CAR constructs derived from a humanized 3F8 scFv have since been tested in glioblastoma patients14 with partial responses reported in four of eight patients. Recently, in trials of GD2-CAR-T cell therapy also using the 14g2a scFv, an impressive 17 of 27 relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma patients showed a response15 and 4 patients with diffuse midline glioma (DMG) had evidence of a radiological response and clinical benefit in a preliminary report.16 Interestingly, also in this study,16 a myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) phenotype was more apparent in Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after intravenous rather than intracerebroventricular administration of GD2-CAR-T cells.",
        "Despite its clinical promise, open questions about the in vivo persistence and lasting effectiveness of GD2-CAR-T cell therapy remain as they do generally for CAR-T cell therapy for patients with solid cancer. Examples include questions about optimal vector design,17 17 arming with immune-active cytokines,3 18 and defences against potential immune-inhibitory effects of myeloid-derived suppressor cells.11 16 19 Interest has also arisen in combining immunotherapy with small molecule kinase inhibitors that are the mainstay of many therapeutic anti-cancer regimens.",
        "Now, in the CARPETS (Phase 1 study of GD2 Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Expressing PEripheral Blood T CellS) trial, we have tested GD2-iCAR-PBT therapy in patients with melanoma and other solid cancers. The treatment of metastatic melanoma has been transformed by immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, although at least 40% of patients will not obtain durable benefit from these approved immunotherapies.20 21 Therefore, an unmet clinical need for other immunotherapies exists. To address concerns about CAR-T cell persistence in vivo, we investigated methods for generating more long-lived CAR-T cells by changing the activation and culture parameters used for ex vivo manufacture.22 23 Predicated on clinical observations of T-cell infiltration of V600-BRAF mutant melanoma after oncogene suppression using BRAF kinase with or without MEK kinase inhibition,24 25 and potentially favorable interactions with antitumor T cells observed in preclinical studies,26 27 we also investigated combining GD2-CAR-T cell therapy with targeted therapy using BRAF and MEK kinase inhibitors, dabrafenib and trametinib, respectively.28 29 The primary objectives were to determine the safety and feasibility of treating this patient population with CAR-T cells manufactured at point of care. Secondary objectives included documentation of anticancer responses, and the evaluation of the in vivo persistence of CAR-T cells together with biomarkers of their activity.",
        "This was a phase 1 clinical study in which V600 BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma patients, who were receiving concurrent treatment using the standard BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination of dabrafenib and trametinib, received intravenous infusions of GD2-iCAR-PBT products. A later clinical protocol amendment allowed enrolment of patients with other GD2-positive solid cancers. 24 patients were prescreened, and their archival tumor biopsy samples were evaluated for GD2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). GD2 expression values ranged from 10% to 70% (figure 1). 14 of these patients were eligible based on GD2 expression and consented to participate in the main study (online supplemental figure S1). Of these 14 patients, 12 patients received the allocated intervention between December 2014 and December 2021. The patient’s age ranged from 35 to 74 years. 13 participants were white Caucasian, and 1 was Maori. 11 males and 3 females were enrolled. Six patients had an ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 at screening and eight had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 1 (table 1). Other subsequently treated patients with GD2-positive solid cancers, who included four metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients and a patient with fibromyxoid sarcoma, had a lower average performance status at the time of CAR-T cell product administration. All four mCRC patients had evidence of cancer inflammation at screening and preinfusion, which was represented by the pan-immune inflammation value30 (online supplemental figure S2A). Interestingly, three of these four patients survived fewer than 3 months from the CAR-T cell infusion.",

        "CAR expression on T cell products ranged from 21% to 69% with no difference between the two manufacturing protocols (figure 2A). CAR expression level per cell, as measured by Mean Fluorescence Intensity, was also equivalent (online supplemental figure S2B). The original manufacturing protocol produced a higher fold-expansion over 9–12 days of culture compared with the modified protocol (mean of 90-fold for original vs 45-fold for modified) likely because of differences in activation reagents (plate bound anti-CD3 and CD-28 vs TransACT nanomatrix activation reagent) and culture media (fetal-calf serum supplemented media vs TEXMACS minimal serum-free media) used between manufacturing protocols (figure 2B). CD3 purity was higher in the modified protocol (mean of 93% for original vs 98% for modified) and was expected because of preculture magnetic bead selection of CD4 and CD8 T cells, and the CD4:CD8 ratio in individual products ranged from 0.7:1 to 3.6:1 (figure 2C–E). Although the memory phenotype of the starting T-cell population did not significantly differ with either protocol, the modified manufacturing protocol resulted in decreased proportions among CD8+and CD4+ CAR T cells of an effector memory phenotype (CD45RA- CCR7-) in favor of central (CD45RA- CCR7+), naïve-like (CD45RA+CCR7+) and TEMRA (CD45RA+CCR7−) phenotypes (figure 2F–H and online supplemental figure S2C,D). We have previously reported that the modified manufacturing protocol promoted a naïve-like phenotype that included expression of T stem-central memory markers: CD45RA+CCR7+ CD95+ CD45RO±when compared with the original protocol for matched donors.23",

        "The study’s other coprimary objective was to determine the safety profile and DLTs of administration of the GD2-iCAR-PBT product. No DLTs were observed, and the maximum tolerated dose was not determined. Of the 12 patients enrolled in the trial, 10 (83%) had at least one treatment-emergent AEs. Of these AEs, none was of a severity higher than grade 2. Most common were rash (50%), fever (33%), diarrhea (33%) and anorexia (33%) (online supplemental table S2). Patient 201 experienced grade 1–2 anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea related to lymphodepletion chemotherapy. Patient 205 had grade 2 nausea related to commencement of cytotoxic chemotherapy for his metastatic colorectal cancer during the 6-week postinfusion evaluation period. In patient 305, a grade 1 fever, which occurred <48 hours post-CAR-T cell infusion, was attributed to CAR-T cell therapy as grade 1 cytokine release syndrome in the absence of alternative explanations. Five of the 12 patients, who received concurrent dabrafenib and trametinib as standard treatment for their V600 BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma, experienced 59% of the low-grade AEs. These AEs were consistent with the known mild dabrafenib-associated and trametinib-associated constitutional, skin, gastrointestinal and arthritic symptoms. There was no evidence of neurotoxicity after the GD2-iCAR-PBT infusion, even in patients who had high disease burden or Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement. In the latter case, 2 of 12 patients, patients 101 and 304, had melanoma brain metastases (M1d disease).",
        "Acknowledged longer-term risks of CAR-T cell therapy include the generation of replication competent retrovirus (RCR) with the potential to induce oncogenic transformation. Accordingly, during long-term follow-up, we tested patient blood samples by qPCR for retroviral envelope protein (GALV env) to indicate recombination event(s) that may enable RCR, and by flow cytometry for TCR diversity to detect emerging oligoclonal expansion that may indicate oncogenic transformation. RCR was never detected in the CAR-T cell product or in any peripheral blood sample of any patient collected after the GD2-iCAR-PBT infusion (online supplemental table S3). Although distinct TCR Vβ usage was observed between CAR-T cells in the infused product and endogenous circulating T cells just before the CAR-T cell infusion, no significant deviations or outgrowths in specific clones were identified postinfusion (online supplemental figure S3). This result indicated that clonal expansion of a transformed CAR-T cell had not occurred.",
        "Documenting an assessment of tumor response was a secondary trial objective and was determined by CT scans at or about day 42 using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V.1.1. Patients receiving BRAF and MEK inhibition concurrent with GD2-CAR-PBT infusion (5 of 12 patients) uniformly achieved a partial response, which may be expected from the combination BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment alone.31 Of patients receiving GD2-iCAR-PBT alone (7 of 12 patients), 2 had transient stabilization of their previously progressing disease, and 5 had progressive disease (table 1). As patient 305 had evidence of stable disease and had not experienced DLTs, she was eligible to receive a second infusion of GD2-iCAR PBT, which she received on day 49 after the first infusion.",
        "A determination of CAR-T cell engraftment, expansion and persistence was made using quantitative real-time DNA PCR (qPCR) to detect in peripheral blood samples the transgene encoding the 14g2a scFv (figure 3). By this measure, all patients had detectable CAR-T cells at one or more time points postinfusion, and for half of patients, peak expansion was observed at day 7 (6 of 12 patients) (figure 3A,B). Evidence of CAR-T cell persistence waned rapidly during the 42-day DLT evaluation window, with the CAR-T transgene detectable in 5 of 12 patients after day 42. Patients treated with CAR-T cells manufactured using the modified protocol showed altered biokinetics, with an increase in the levels of circulating CAR-T cells as shown by the significantly higher area under the curve (AUC mean 12 402 vs 54,216; p=0.0086) (figure 3C). Mean peak expansion (CMAX: 482 vs 1177 transgene copies/ug, figure 3D) and day of peak expansion (day 11 vs day 19, figure 3E) were not significantly different among the patients who received CAR-T cells made using original or modified protocols.",

        "In addition, flow cytometry was performed using the anti-idiotypic 1A7 antibody to detect circulating T cells with surface expression of the CAR. Although this assay had lower specificity and sensitivity, and thus a higher limit of detection than qPCR (figure 3F), it did allow immune phenotyping of circulating CAR-T cells, including quantification of CD4+ and CD8+ subsets (figure 3G,H). This analysis revealed that most circulating CAR+cells were CD8+. Although the kinetics of CAR-T cell expansion detected by flow cytometry was like that evident by qPCR, the day of peak expansion differed in some cases. In patient 201, for example, the CAR transgene peaked between days 7 and 14 but CAR surface expression peaked on day 28. This result may reflect the variable surface expression of the CAR molecule, which is influenced both by the location of retroviral insertion site(s) and T-cell activation status. In T cells transduced with gamma retrovirus, highly activated T cells are expected to be more transcriptionally active with subsequently higher expression of the retrovirally introduced transgene.32 Interestingly, the proportion of naïve-like CD8 T cells in the infused CAR-T cell product showed a significant positive correlation with post-infusion CAR-T cell expansion (figure 3I). Blood lymphocyte counts at the time of peak expansion showed a negative correlation with CAR-T cell expansion (figure 3J). The CAR-T cell dose level did not show an evident relationship (figure 3K, full analysis of correlations online supplemental figure S2G).",
        "To evaluate whether CAR-T cell persistence was affected by the patient mounting an anti-CAR immune response we, determined serum human-anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) levels pre-CAR-T and post-CAR-T cell infusion (online supplemental figure S4). These data revealed that only 3 of 12 patients (patients 201, 203, and 305) mounted a HAMA response above the day 0 baseline level after the CAR-T cell infusion. Of these patients, only one (patient 201) developed high level HAMA (>10 ng/mL) and this patient had elevated HAMA at baseline. Although HAMA may indicate anti-CAR immunity, it does not directly assess cellular responses to the CAR transgene, which may still contribute to the limited persistence observed. We have previously assessed ex vivo cellular immune responses of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) to irradiated CAR-T product for a subset of trial patients and did not observe significant reactivity.29",
        "We also assayed other peripheral biomarkers of response via serum cytokine analysis. In patient sera, significant increases from baseline (day 0, preinfusion) were observed for IL-6 (7 of 12 patients), IL-8 (6 of 12 patients), IP-10 (CXCL10) (8 of 12 patients), MCP-1 (CCL2) (4 of 12 patients), IFN-y (5 of 12 patients), TNFα (4 of 12 patients), and GM-CSF (4 of 12 patients). See figure 4A–I for a summary of fold-change by manufacturing protocol and online supplemental figure S4 for individual cytokine profiles and online supplemental figure S5 for raw data (pg/mL) with statistical analysis. When considered by manufacturing protocol, there was a significant increase in IL-6 at day 7 for patients treated with cells manufactured under the original protocol (figure 4J), and a significant increase in IL-8 at 24 hours for patients treated with cells manufactured under the modified protocol (figure 4K). We observed postinfusion increases or decreases in serum levels of IL-2, IL-1β, IL-10 and IL-4 for some individual patients but not in most patients. Free-active TGFβ, IL-12p70, IL-17A did not change significantly from baseline (data not shown). The proinflammatory cytokines, IL-8 and GM-CSF, showed positive correlations with CAR-T cell expansion (figure 4L,M). Furthermore, the proinflammatory chemokine, MCP-1 (CCL2), together with the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) also showed modest positive correlations with CAR-T cell expansion (online supplemental figure S2E,F).",

        "To specifically investigate effects on the myeloid compartment, which have been documented in numerous other trials, particularly those employing a GD2-specific CAR-T product,11 16 33 we employed a high-parameter flow cytometry panel designed to evaluate different circulating myeloid populations including MDSC. This revealed that most patients (six of the seven evaluated patients) had increases in either non-classical monocytes or CD14+MDSC (M-MDSC) or CD15+MDSC (PMN-MDSC) between days 7 and 14 after the CAR-T cell infusion (online supplemental figure S7). Although the correlation analysis uncovered a trend toward an inverse relationship between MDSC and CAR-T cell expansion, the low sample number limits this analysis (online supplemental figure S2G)",
        "A number of CAR-T cells circulating at the peak of expansion (days 7–28) were sufficient to perform further high-parameter flow cytometric analysis on banked PBMC, which enabled us to interrogate the GD2-iCAR-PBT phenotype compared with both circulating endogenous T cells and the GD2-iCAR-PBT product before infusion (figure 5A and online supplemental figure S8).",

        "We observed a distinct phenotype for circulating CAR+T cells including a lower proportion of CD4+ compared with to CD8+ cells as noted above (figure 3G,H and figure 5B,C). Compared with endogenous T cells, circulating CAR+T cells also had significantly elevated markers associated with antigen experience and effector differentiation: PD-1 (mean 20.73% vs 37.99%, p=0.0007), CCR5 (mean 23.42% vs 51.07%, p=0.0052), CX3CR1 (mean 19.91% vs 94.92%, p<0.0001)) although they did not have high levels of LAG-3 (figure 5D–G). Circulating CAR-T cells had a predominant TEMRA phenotype compared with circulating endogenous T cells, which have a predominantly naïve phenotype (figure 5H–K). Circulating CAR+T cells also had significantly lower expression of markers associated with naïve phenotype or early effector function: CCR7 (mean 51% of endogenous T cells vs 13% of CAR-T cells, p<0.0001, CD28 (mean 79.03% of endogenous T cells vs 13.75% of CAR-T cells, p<0.0001) (figure 5L,M). Higher expression of PD-1, CCR5 and CX3CR1 suggests circulating CAR-T cells have a highly activated effector and effector memory phenotype.34 The striking loss of CD28 on the circulating CAR-T cells compared with the preinfusion GD2-iCAR-PBT product further supports antigen engagement following infusion, rather than the activation occurring during culture and expansion.",
        "To assess CAR-T cell infiltration, an optional postinfusion tumor biopsy was done in some patients. Where sufficient and appropriate tumor material was available, fresh-frozen tissue, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and tissue dissociated to a single cell suspension were all banked for future analysis. Online supplemental table S4 summarizes the post-treatment tumor biopsy material available to this study and its processing and downstream analysis. As reported by an independent pathologist, two biopsies taken during the 6-week evaluation period (from patients 203 and 305 at days 57 and 21 postinfusion, respectively) were found to have substantial tumor deposits, whereas three biopsies were found to have minimal viable tumor with areas of necrotic and fibrotic tissue and immune infiltrates (from patients 101, 303, and 304, and taken in years 1–2 post-treatment). H&E and GD2 IHC were performed on post-treatment biopsies at SA pathology (figure 6A; left column H&E, right column GD2 staining in dark red), and an automated analysis of GD2 staining intensity and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which was performed by an independent pathologist, showed a trend toward decreased GD2 staining post-treatment (p=0.053) and no difference in the level of TIL (p=0.7) (online supplemental figure S9A,B).",
        "Evidence of tumor CAR-T cell infiltration. Biopsies were collected at various time points after each CAR-T cell infusion depending on patient consent and clinical circumstances (range day 21 to year 3; for full details see online supplemental table S3). (A) Tissue pieces from post-treatment biopsies were preserved in formalin with paraffin embedding (FFPE) and stained with H&E (left column) and using GD2 IHC (right column, dark red GD2 with hematoxylin counter stain).

(B) CAR-T cells infiltrating tumor as assessed by (i) quantitative PCR for CAR transgene with a Taqman probe designed for the 14g2a scFv DNA sequence on genomic DNA derived from tumor biopsies from five patients and from an ascites sample from one patient (306); (ii) Flow cytometry using the 1A7 anti-idiotypic antibody for three patients with sufficient fresh single cell suspensions. (C) In situ hybridisation (ISC; RNAScope) was used to detect CD3 (magenta) and retroviral mRNA (CARretro; blue/green) in FFPE tissue, with melanoma cells showing brown melanin pigment.

LOD, limit of detection; CAR, chimeric antigen receptor.",
        "From dissociated tissue, qPCR and flow cytometry were used to quantify the level of CAR-T cell infiltration (figure 6Bi,ii) and demonstrated CAR-T cell trafficking and infiltration above the limit of detection in three of six available patient biopsy samples. To assess CAR-T cell infiltration in situ, RNAScope was performed with probes designed to detect the mRNA originating from the GD2-CAR retrovector. Using this technique, we were likewise able to identify tumor-infiltrating GD2-CAR-T cells in three of six FFPE biopsies (figure 6C). Finally, to directly identify CAR-expressing T cells we performed multicolour immunofluorescence (IF) on the available fresh-frozen tissue samples, with costaining for cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) as an indicator of CAR-T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Patient 203 had the most abundant staining for both CD3+T cells and CAR+T cells with CC3 staining in tumor cells adjacent to T cells (figure 6D and online supplemental figure S10).",
        "High-parameter flow cytometry using the immune phenotyping panel described for circulating T cells was also performed for samples with sufficient material (at least 200,000 cryopreserved cells). The samples analyzed by high-parameter flow cytometry were from patient 203 and patient 305 tumor biopsies and from patient 306’s ascitic fluid (online supplemental figure S9C–L). Proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells among CAR+TIL and endogenous TIL were equivalent and were mostly TEM/TEMRA (online supplemental figure S9C–F). Expression of other phenotypic markers, PD1 and LAG-3, was likewise equivalent on CAR+ and endogenous TIL (online supplemental figure S9H,I) but elevated compared with the circulating CAR+T cells described above (figure 5D,E), suggesting a more functionally suppressed phenotype. Expression of CX3CR1 was significantly elevated among CAR+T cells versus endogenous T cells in tumor tissues (mean 83% vs 10.8%, p=0.0268, online supplemental figure S9L). Evaluation of ascitic fluid during the postinfusion period revealed predominant cell types of the monocyte-macrophage lineage and T cells of which a very small proportion, were CAR+T cells, peaking at day 7 (online supplemental figure S9M–P).",
        "GD2-specific CAR-T cells have been administered to over 57 patients with neuroblastoma8 11 13 15 and recently four patients with DMG16 and eight patients with glioblastoma14 with no evidence of on-target, off-tumor toxicity from CAR-T cells targeting GD2 on normal tissue, and with evidence of tumor responses and clinical benefit in some patients. Here, we report the safe administration of third-generation, GD2-specific autologous CAR-T cell therapy to 12 patients with metastatic GD2-positive solid cancers. Although treatment-emergent AEs were recorded in most patients, all were low grade, and no patient experienced a DLT. Our results are like those recently reported for a 13-patient trial using an identical GD2-CAR vector in patients with relapsed neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. In that study a different manufacturing protocol with cell expansion in IL-2 was used and all patients received preconditioning chemotherapy, however, similar outcomes of variable expansion, limited persistence and no long-term tumor responses13 were observed as in our study.",
        "Peripheral expansion and persistence is an important biomarker of CAR-T cell function and correlates with efficacy in CD19-CAR-T cell therapy. For example, the median value for peak expansion in the ELIANA and ENSIGN trials with Tisagenlecleucal was 44 800 copies/μg DNA for responders compared with 22,000 copies/μg DNA in non-responders.35 1000 copies/100 ng has recently been used as a benchmark for “good” expansion in a GD2-CAR-therapy trial.13 However, there have not been enough studies of effective CAR-T cell therapy in solid cancer patients to determine biological correlates of therapeutic success. Here, we report the peripheral expansion and persistence of CAR-T cells, acknowledging that this measure does not capture CAR-T cells residing in the tumor tissue and secondary lymphoid organs. Irrespective of dose level, we found limited CAR-T cell persistence beyond 6 weeks, with a maximum expansion of 3233 copies/µg DNA for patient 305 whose CAR-T cells were manufactured using the modified protocol. Only patient 305 received a second infusion and the AUC of this second CAR-T cell expansion, as detected by qPCR for the GD2-iCAR transgene, was not significantly different from the AUC after the first infusion. As expected, patient 201, the only patient who had received prior lymphodepletion, also exhibited improved expansion.",
        "Previously, we observed that the modified manufacturing protocol changed CAR-T cell phenotype to increase the proportion of central-memory-like, CCR7 and CD62L-expressing cells.21 Here, we found that the patients treated with these optimized CAR-T cell products had improved CAR-T expansion and persistence, as represented by a significantly higher AUC, despite these patients having at the time of enrolment such indications of poorer response to immunotherapy as a reduced performance status and higher PIV.30 36 CAR-T cell persistence in patients has been linked to the availability of antigen and antigen-presenting cell (APC) support in providing the third signal for costimulation.37 Although CD19-CAR-T cells have access to antigen and APCs in circulation, CAR-T cell therapies directed toward solid cancer targets do not. Therefore, our GD2-CAR-T cells may not persist because of inaccessible or unavailable GD2 target antigen or do not establish in secondary lymphoid organs where they might receive costimulatory support from APCs, or both. Activation-induced cell death is another persistence-limiting mechanism, which we identified when GD2-CAR-T cells were manufactured using the original protocol,29 and which is partially prevented using the modified manufacturing protocol.21 Finally, humoral, and cellular immune responses to the chimeric proteins induced by exposure to the CAR molecule have also been identified as a mechanism of CAR-T cell deletion.38 However, most of our patients did not display elevated HAMA, which serves as a marker of the immunogenic potential of the CAR.39",
        "Changes in serum cytokine levels may represent systemic effects of cancer-induced inflammation, which is reflected in an elevated PIV. An elevated PIV often accompanies poor prognosis malignancies36 as evident in some patients enrolled to this trial. Changes in serum cytokine levels may also provide evidence of CAR-T cell-related immune reactions, which might manifest as cytokine release syndrome within 72 hours of the infusion, or later be related to systemic immune reactions following antigen engagement by CAR-T cells. Many patients had postinfusion increases in serum concentrations of the T cell-related cytokines IFNγ and TNFα, whereas IL-6 and IL-8, as markers of more general systemic inflammation, showed peaks at earlier postinfusion time points. Interestingly, the different patterns of IL-6 and IL-8 secretion depended on the type of manufacturing protocol with the original protocol resulting in higher serum IL-6 levels and, conversely, the modified protocol resulting in higher serum IL-8 levels. The pronounced effect that the original protocol has on generating effector memory T cells may help to explain the observation of relatively increased serum levels of IL-6. Several patients had postinfusion elevations of CXCL10 (IP-10), particularly patient 205 who restarted cytotoxic chemotherapy during the 6-week evaluation period because of the patient’s concern over a rising serum CEA tumor marker. IP-10 signals T cells via CXCR3 to induce T-cell infiltration of tumors and its production has indicated, for example, an antimelanoma T-cell response after PD-1 inhibitor therapy.40",
        "We also noted changes in circulating myeloid cells as has been reported for other GD2-CAR-T cell therapy trials.11 13 15 There is an increasing evidence that subsets of suppressive myeloid cells can curtail the effectiveness of CAR-T cells, but it is less clear whether these are solely pre-existing, tumor-induced populations or are also induced in response to the CAR-T cell infusion and following target antigen engagement within the tumor.11 13 15 16 Our data support a CAR-T cell-mediated expansion of monocyte and MDSCs, which was observed on days 7–14 postinfusion in some patients. The postinfusion appearance in peripheral blood of different subsets of MDSC may serve as a biomarker for CAR-T cell engagement within the tumor and represent a tumor-driven mechanism for subverting T-cell effector responses.41 Certain cytotoxic drugs can reduce MDSC populations,42 43 and CAR-T engineering approaches that reprogram myeloid cells to an “immune-activation” phenotype or eliminate MDSC,44 45 may help to improve CAR-T cell therapy for solid cancer patients.",
        "Determining biomarkers associated with CAR-T cell persistence and function in solid cancer patients remains an important clinical research goal. In this study, we have found that correlates of expansion included a higher proportion of naïve-like T cells in the infusion product and an increase in some inflammatory cytokines (GM-CSF, in keeping with a recent report,13 CCL2 and IL-8) but notably not CAR-T cell dose level. However, the low number of patients limited our ability to identify any biomarker correlates of potentially positive clinical outcomes like disease stabilization.",
        "Of the patients with marked CAR-T cell expansion, patient 201 who had lymphodepletion, and patients 205, 305, 306, and 307, whose products were manufactured using the modified protocol, all had the highest fold increases in CCL2 and GM-CSF and, with the exception of Patient 305, also had the highest PIV. Together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis raised recently in the report of GD2-CAR-T cell therapy in patients with solid cancer,13 that robust CAR-T cell activity ultimately limits its own effectiveness via CAR-T cell-induced expansion of protumorigenic myeloid cells.",
        "In summary, the CARPETS study confirmed the safety of the GD2-iCAR-PBT but also showed a lack of persistence of the CAR-T cell product in the circulation together with the induction of potentially immune suppressive myeloid cells in some patients. Despite prior expectations that, by apparently overcoming oncogene-induced intratumoral immune suppression,24 25 concurrent BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy would augment adoptive cell therapies27 we did not discern any positive effect of BRAF/MEK inhibition (by dabrafenib and trametinib) on GD2-CAR-T cell expansion or persistence in metastatic melanoma patients. It is possible that BRAF/MEK inhibitors impairs the function of T cells as we have reported in vitro.46 Five patients initially treated with dabrafenib and trametinib responded as anticipated for patients receiving kinase inhibitor therapy only. Of patients receiving only GD2-iCAR-PBT without kinase inhibitor, five had progressive disease at follow-up, and two patients had disease stabilization. Disease progression was associated with the advanced treatment-resistant disease of these patients at the time of enrolment, as indicated by markers of cancer-induced inflammation and reduced performance status.",
        "Although there was indirect and direct evidence of intratumoral CAR-T cell engagement in most patients by the detection of tumor CAR-T cell infiltration, immune phenotypic changes in circulating CAR-T cells, and postinfusion elevations of serum cytokines, these findings did not correspond to apparent CAR-T cell-related disease control. Although we do not consider the anticancer activity of this CAR-T cell product alone sufficient to warrant a phase 2 study, we note that, after the CARPETS trial began, several improvements in GD2-CAR retroviral constructs, which aim to prolong CAR-T cell persistence and enhance antitumor responses. For example, changes to the CAR molecule structure together with coexpression of the immunostimulatory cytokine, IL-15,47 48 or the addition of a constitutively active IL-7 receptor (NCT03635632), are being tested clinically. Recently, cancers such as gliomas with high and homogeneous GD2 expression also represent promising target diseases for GD2-CAR-T cell therapy.3 16 In conclusion, GD2-targeting CAR T cells remain an active and promising CAR-T cell therapy for multiple tumor indications.",
        "This single-centre, open label, phase 1 trial was prospectively registered in the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (www.anzctr.org.au: ACTRN 12613000198729).",
        "All patients provided written informed consent. Dose escalation employed the Bayesian dose-finding modified continual reassessment method (mCRM) to determine the safety of one intravenous injection of autologous GD2-iCAR-PBT. Dose escalation proceeded through three cell dose levels: (1) 1×107/m2, (2) 2×107/m2, and (3) 1×108/m2. Patients over 18 years old were eligible for enrolment if their tumors had GD2 expression on at least 10% of tumor cells. For patients with unresectable, metastatic melanoma who had V600E/K/R/D BRAF mutant disease, oral dabrafenib (150 mg two times per day) and trametinib (2 mg once daily) kinase inhibitor therapy was commenced while their CAR-T cell product was being prepared. Administration of dabrafenib and trametinib continued as per standard of care until disease progression or intolerance of therapy. Metastatic melanoma patients whose tumors lacked a V600 BRAF mutation, and thus who were ineligible for combination kinase inhibitor therapy, could receive intravenous lymphodepletion chemotherapy comprising fludarabine 30mg/m2 on days −4 to –3 and −2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 on days −4 and −3 before the CAR-T cell infusion on day 0. In patients not receiving dabrafenib and trametinib, a repeat CAR-T cell infusion was allowed in the absence of DLTs and with at least stable disease at the first tumor assessment.",
        "All autologous cell production occurred in the Cellular Therapies Laboratory at SA Pathology, Adelaide, under GMP-like conditions with Clinical Trials Exemption/Clinical Trials Application scheme approval (#CTX-2014-001 V2) from the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia. PBMCs were collected from 280 mL peripheral venous blood of eligible patients to produce CAR-T cells. The original manufacturing protocol was adapted from the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, Texas, USA) and used for the first six treated patients.20 28 29 Aiming to improve CAR-T cell persistence in vivo, a modified manufacturing protocol using Miltenyi Biotec reagents was adopted for the final six treated patients21 with further details provided below. For the latter patients, dose escalation recommenced at the level 2 cell dose of 2×107/m2. In all cases, after cell manufacture, CAR-T cells were cryopreserved and products were not released for later intravenous infusion unless stringent batch release quality criteria were satisfied.",
        "All patients were monitored intensively for 24 hours postinfusion at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and then reviewed clinically with blood draws at the following time points: days 7, 14, 28, and 42 of the 6-week postinfusion DLT evaluation period. CT for tumor assessment was performed approximately 6 weeks postinfusion and subsequently as per standard of care to obtain tumor measurements using RECIST V.1.1.

The original manufacturing protocol was described previously.23 29 Briefly, PBMCs were activated with plate-bound CD3 and CD28-specific antibodies in T-cell media (45% advanced RPMI, 45% Click’s Media, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1% L-Glutamine, supplemented with recombinant human (rh) IL-7 (10 ng/mL) and rhIL-15 (5 ng/mL) from 48 hours) for 72 hours before retroviral transduction and further expansion in Grex flasks (Wilson Wolff). Under the modified manufacturing protocol,23 CD4-positive and CD8-positive cells were magnetically selected from peripheral blood using the Clinimacs Plus with CD4 and CD8 Reagent (Miltenyi Biotec). Then, cells were activated using GMP-grade TransACT in TEXMACS medium (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the medium was supplemented with rhIL-7 and rhIL-15 as above. Subsequently, activated T cells were retrovirally transduced and expanded as above.

        "The immense potential of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) for regenerative capacity and immunosuppression has been increasingly explored for treating a diverse group of diseases such as neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, autoimmune, bone, cartilage, kidney, liver, cancer, and other disorders (Galipeau and Sensébé, 2018; Pittenger et al., 2019; Saeedi et al., 2019; Kabat et al., 2020). It is well documented now that hMSCs, after transplantation, exert the therapeutic effects through two mechanisms: (i) differentiate into functional cells and facilitate tissue repair by homing into the injured sites (Mastrolia et al., 2019) and (ii) secrete growth factors and cytokines to stimulate immunosuppressive effects by modulating the immune cells (T-cells, dendritic cells, NK cells, and B-cells), angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling (Pittenger et al., 2019). In addition, hMSCs have low immunogenicity and thus they have the potential to be used for both autologous and allogeneic therapy (Hassouna et al., 2019).",
        "With over 900 hMSC clinical trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov, the field has expanded its understanding and application of hMSCs and seems poised for success (Levy et al., 2020). Initial successes include the 2018 European approval of TiGenix/Takeda, Alofisel®, for complex perianal fistulas in Crohn’s disease. However, only around 300 trials were completed as of 2020, and the total number of approved hMSCs therapy stands at just 10 (Levy et al., 2020). Earlier this year, one of the approved hMSC products’ remestemcel-L (RyoncilTM, Mesoblast) phase 3 clinical trial showed significant improvement in pediatric patients who failed to respond to steroid treatment for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (Kurtzberg et al., 2020).",
        "Given the backdrop of increasing interest in using hMSC therapies to fulfill unmet patient needs, there are still inherent industry challenges that would pose barriers to market access, especially within the manufacturing process. Some of the main challenges are product consistency in terms of quality and efficacy, raw material qualification to ensure that the clinical product meets regulatory compliance, cost of cell processing as manufacturing is scaled up or scaled out, and lack of advanced check-point analytical tools to carry out the process and product quality assessment. If the clinical product is not consistent, batch failures are imminent, leading to loss of productivity and compromised sustainability. Protocol amendments can impact the timely progress of all functions including R&D, process development, quality control, manufacturing, regulatory, and clinical testing. To implement a substantial clinical protocol amendment, the median costs can be $141,000 for phase II and $535,000 for phase III protocols (Getz et al., 2016). That is why choosing the right starting raw materials is very important as early as the process development stage. When moving toward clinical trials, developers need more safety and regulatory features to foresee and meet regulatory requirements. It is the responsibility of the hMSC manufacturer to qualify the performance of the raw materials, assess the lot-to-lot variability, test residuals on the final cell product, and determine the need for any additional safety testing. Furthermore, the manufacturer needs to qualify whether the intended suppliers can provide raw material traceability, characterization, and regulatory filing support documentation.",
        "Concomitantly, both autologous and allogeneic cell therapy manufacturing workflow comprises of many different unit operations and, thus, is very complex and labor-intensive due to open processing. Open manipulations are prone to errors and contamination leading to a risk of failed production runs. Besides, manual methods to synchronize different steps in scale-out or scale-up processes and proper workflow documentation to satisfy GMP compliance adds another layer of complexity. In contrast, closing the process and automating the entire manufacturing workflow through digital integration would reduce the risks of open operations and improves product consistency, which is a critical necessity for a GMP setting (Moutsatsou et al., 2019).",
        "Furthermore, identification and assessment of critical quality attributes (purity, potency, and safety) for release criteria as early as the process development stage would ensure product consistency during commercial manufacturing (National Academies of Sciences Engineering, Medicine, Health and Medicine Division, Board on Health Sciences Policy, and Forum on Regenerative Medicine, 2017). In 2006, the International Society of Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT) came up with a “minimal criteria” for defining hMSC (Dominici et al., 2006). While it is useful in defining the identity and some functionality of hMSCs, it stopped short of defining other critical attributes such as its immunomodulatory capability of cells and other novel biomarkers (Samsonraj et al., 2017). In 2019, the criteria were updated by the ISCT to include the tissue-source origin of the cells and a matrix of functional assays such as secretion of trophic factors ensuring more meaningful information is collected to properly assess the therapeutic potential of hMSCs (Viswanathan et al., 2019). Yet, there remains a lack of a minimum set of standard guide release criteria that hMSC manufacturers targeting different diseases can adopt for regulatory approvals. Additionally, if the manufacturers are targeting their hMSC products for multiple regions, it is important to align with each region’s regulatory guidance as it is imperative to note that each region has unique raw material regulatory guidance documentation.",
        "In this review, we discuss the raw materials considerations for hMSC manufacturing with a particular focus on QC/safety testing expectations from global regulatory guidelines. We propose a rationale of why closed, automated, and modular systems are integral to GMP manufacturing and discuss possible workflow solutions for both scale-out and scale-up processes. We focus on hMSC product characterization tools and provide insights to improve existing assays throughout the development and manufacturing process. We also shed light on the regulatory perspectives of current hMSC products in the market and potential future guidelines for regulatory approvals in different global regions.",
        "hMSC culture systems have evolved over the last 40 years. Table 1 summarizes common hMSC culture systems and critical raw materials used following regulatory expectations of quality and safety testing. There are many do-it-yourself and commercially available serum-free and xeno-free (XF) culture systems currently; however, there is no harmonization in the way culture systems are being classified. To avoid ambiguity, we attempt to define the classification of culture media in Table 1 (Jayme and Smith, 2000). ISO/TS 20399 also lists definitions of ancillary materials that the field could aim to adopt. Today, there are over 30 hMSC expansion media marketed as “XF” by commercial suppliers (Gottipamula et al., 2013). We will focus on discussing XF culture systems supplemented with human platelet lysate (hPL) or recombinant human proteins and growth factors as these are current trends in the field (Guiotto et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020).",
        "Classification of hMSC culture systems.",
        "Friedenstein et al. (1970) were the first to report the culture of fibroblast-like colonies from guinea pig bone marrow in media supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). Media supplemented with 10–20% FBS has since been recognized as a conventional method to expand hMSCs from various tissue sources (Haynesworth et al., 1992) and has been used as an ancillary reagent in clinical trials since the early 1990s.",
        "Safety concerns using undefined animal serum include risks of introducing pathogens, exposing patients to xenogenic infections, and unintended immunological reactions to bovine proteins (Macy et al., 1989; Heiskanen et al., 2007). Twenty to fifty percent of commercial FBS is tested positive for viruses and not all lots are suitable for MSC isolation and expansion (Wessman and Levings, 1999; Gottipamula et al., 2013). Although regulatory authorities allow the use of FBS as a raw material for clinical production, cell therapy manufacturers would have to ensure that FBS is adequately controlled and that viral testing/inactivation processes (gamma-irradiation/mycoplasma/sterility, 9CFR virus testing) (TSE/BSE sourcing) and specific risk assessments are thoroughly performed in conformity to the relevant regulatory guidance (Supplementary Table 1).",
        "Given the lot-to-lot variability of FBS, significant investment in time and costs have to be made in rigorous screening, selection, and validation of suitable lots to ensure consistency and reproducibility in culture performance expansion (van der Valk et al., 2004). The presence of FBS during the hMSC expansion could also influence cell quality attributes—hMSC cultures could undergo early senescence with progressive loss of differentiation capacity (Bieback et al., 2012). Overall, FBS is viewed as a high-risk material (USP < 1043 > ancillary material risk tier 4) and regulatory agencies have recommended manufacturers to use non-animal, non-ruminant materials if the option exists. The field has thus shifted toward adopting xeno- and serum-free culture systems for hMSC manufacturing.",
        "Today, hPL has been suggested as an XF substitute of FBS (Doucet et al., 2005), and it has been increasingly used in trials. A survey of bone marrow transplantation centers in Europe reported 77% of centers use hPL-supplemented media for trials utilizing hMSCs. Initially described by Doucet et al. (2005), hPL is derived from platelet-rich plasma of whole blood donations or apheresis collections (Schallmoser and Strunk, 2013). Platelets are subjected to lysis through repeated freeze/thaw cycles resulting in the release of bioactive molecules and growth factors involved in stimulating mitogenesis and promoting cell adherence (Guiotto et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). Research has shown that hMSCs expanded in hPL-supplemented media retain their in vitro and in vivo characteristics and generally achieve superior proliferation rates over hMSCs expanded in FBS-based systems (Schallmoser et al., 2007; Bieback et al., 2009; Ben Azouna et al., 2012; Griffiths et al., 2013). As such, hPL culture systems are viewed as a desirable option to enable large-scale commercial manufacturing of hMSCs in both 2D and 3D suspension-based platforms. There are, however, ongoing challenges with using hPL in hMSC manufacturing. hPL is undefined and its composition is inherently heterogeneous. Many factors such as donor differences (i.e., gender, age, blood group, metabolites) and production processes influence batch-to-batch variation (Lohmann et al., 2012; Pierce et al., 2017).",
        "A key gap lies in the lack of standardized methods used in sourcing, producing, and quality/safety testing of hPL. Usually, hPL is prepared from a large allogenic pool of blood donation to balance out variation in growth factor concentrations across donors and manufactured lots. However, the size of the donor pool has recently come under regulatory scrutiny due to concerns over risks of transmitting bloodborne pathogens. European Pharmacopeia general chapter 5.2.12 recommends that pooled donations must be limited otherwise pathogen reduction treatment (PRT) needs to be applied during hPL production. Pathogens can be reduced or inactivated by several methods such as gamma-irradiation and treatment with amotosalen + ultraviolet (UV)A light, riboflavin + UVB light, UVC light, or solvent/detergent (S/D). While global regulatory agencies and pharmacopeia recommend limiting the size of the donor pool, no specific guidelines have been given aside from German regulations that restrict the size to 16 donors without the need for pathogen reduction.",
        "hMSC therapy developers using hPL-based culture systems will face some limitations around batch consistency, safety, costs associated with outsourcing PRT, and additional performance testing to ensure that release criteria are met using hPL subjected to PRT. It is no surprise that the industry is in favor of using defined serum-free and XF formulations containing only human proteins and growth factors, but there are still several barriers to regulatory acceptance and commercialization to consider. Firstly, suppliers of hMSC XF systems do not often state that their formulation fully utilizes human recombinant proteins and growth factors. Such systems could still contain proteins purified directly from human plasma (i.e., human serum albumin or human transferrin). Cell therapy developers will have to ensure that the human plasma-derived proteins are sourced from low-risk origins and accredited blood banks and have the necessary adventitious agent testing and inactivation performed. Secondly, human recombinant proteins used in hMSC XF culture systems could be expressed in mammalian cell lines such as CHO or HEK. Regulatory guidance suggests following the principles of ICHQ5A (viral testing evaluation) and ICHQ5D (characterization/lineage history) in establishing master cell banks (MCB) for products derived from cell lines of human or animal origin. hMSC developers should consult with their suppliers on the quality and documentation available for proteins derived from mammalian MCBs. As a safer alternative, hMSC developers and suppliers could aim to use recombinant proteins expressed only in non-mammalian and non-animal cell lines. Thirdly, unlike serum and undefined hPL, hMSC XF culture systems containing purified and/or recombinant proteins lack extracellular matrix proteins to support cell adhesion. Pre-coating surfaces with common cell adhesion proteins such as human collagen and human fibronectin are required. To ease the expansion process, hMSC developers have been exploring coating-free methods by simply supplementing cell adhesion proteins directly to the culture media. However, obtaining a consistent and affordable supply of GMP-grade collagen or fibronectin and their respective animal-origin free recombinant alternatives remains a current industry challenge. Recent studies have reported the use of recombinant vitronectin for hMSC expansion as an alternative substrate to fibronectin and collagen. Recombinant vitronectin protein fragments are widely used in the expansion of pluripotent stem cells with GMP-grade, animal-origin free versions available by several commercial suppliers.",
        "With this background, developers need to identify and evaluate regulatory compliant hMSC raw materials and optimize expansion and characteristics in small scale during the early process development stage. This exercise would serve as a prerequisite for the next stage of large-scale GMP manufacturing in a closed and automated manner.",
        "In this section, we will discuss the benefits of closing the process, automation, and single-use technologies (SUTs) followed by a review of existing and proposed closed automation solutions for each of the hMSC manufacturing unit operations.",
        "MSC-based therapies require large-scale manufacturing, conserving both the phenotypic characteristics and functional potency of the donor-derived MSCs. Typically, both allogeneic and autologous hMSC manufacturing processes include cell isolation, followed by ex vivo cell expansion, harvesting the expanded hMSCs, wash and concentrate cells, and final fill and finish cell doses (formulation) either for direct infusion or for cryopreservation. Currently, most of these unit operations in the hMSC manufacturing are manual or semi-automated involving largely open processes (Timmins et al., 2012; Nguyen, 2016). Consequently, these are laborious, labor-intensive, prone to cross-contamination resulting in production loss, batch-to-batch inconsistency, high manufacturing costs due to the requirement of a large footprint of the facility with dedicated Class B processing areas, and increased environmental monitoring (Moutsatsou et al., 2019). This creates a major challenge for hMSC manufacturing under a stringent GMP regulatory framework, which is critical for commercial-scale GMP manufacturing. Closing and automating the entire processes produce consistent product quality and reduce the risk of contamination during each step of the workflow, enabling a significant cost reduction and ensuring regulatory compliance through standardized manufacturing and process reproducibility (James, 2017; Moutsatsou et al., 2019).",
        "Closing the process is often achieved by using SUTs, which protect against contaminants outside of a cleanroom environment or biosafety cabinet. SUTs include disposable tubings, connectors, bags for cryopreservation, bioreactors and product transfer, vials, mixers, and filters. Closed system connectivity for sterile fluid transfer is accomplished through the use of tube welding/sealing or aseptic connectors. Tubing used in cell therapy manufacturing comes in different sizes (i.e., 1/8′′ ID, 1/4′′ ID, and 3/8′′ ID) and materials (i.e., PVC and C-Flex®). Tube welding/sealing is a widely adopted method for sterile connections in biopharma industries because of its ease of use. The most commonly used tube welders are Terumo TSCD® II, Terumo SCB® IIB, and BioWelder® Total Containment from Sartorius. However, some inherent challenges remain such as particulate generation during the welding process, inability to join tubing of different sizes, different welders required for different tube sizes, and different types of thermoplastic tubings cannot be welded together (Clarke et al., 2016). To address these challenges, aseptic genderless connectors would offer the flexibility to work with any tubing size or material. Genderless connectors utilize three simple steps to enable sterile connection, “flip-click-pull” (CPC AseptiQuik®) or “click-pull-twist” (Pall Kleenpak® Presto). These aseptic connectors are however not pre-fitted with tubing. Cell therapy manufacturers would have to work with their suppliers to customize single-use bags with compatible tubing dimensions for sterile connections or welding to other SUTs.",
        "Automation is critical for large-scale commercial GMP manufacturing and most importantly enables closed system processing (James, 2017). There are two types of closed automation platforms for cell therapy manufacturing: (1) Closed automated system with integrated incubation and (2) Closed automated system with centralized incubation (James, 2017; Ball et al., 2018). In option 1, all of the unit operation processes are combined into a single automation system (e.g., Miltenyi’s Prodigy and Lonza’s Cocoon) and are specifically designed for autologous cell therapy manufacturing. These devices can do parallel processing in Class C processing area with minimal labor, “but” the processing equipment is poorly utilized due to the lengthy incubation periods, e.g., one machine processes one patient at a time and it is locked for use for 1–2 weeks depending on the number of cells that are expanded. This would result in the need for more machines and increases the cost-of-goods (COGS) for processing more patients for a given duration (James, 2017; Ball et al., 2018). Also, scalability for different MSC batch sizes due to the limited incubator space is one of the major challenges (Nguyen, 2016) since multiple dosing might be required for MSC therapy due to limited engraftment and survival rate of transplanted cells (Wysoczynski et al., 2018; Pittenger et al., 2019). In contrast, option 2 provides end-to-end manufacturing by integrating different modular automated systems and is highly suited for both autologous and allogenic manufacturing. This modular approach allows parallel processing in Class C area with high equipment and facility utilization achieved by separating incubation. It provides process flexibility for optimizing different conditions and the ability to incorporate new technologies that are critical for the early stage translational therapy developers (Ball et al., 2018). However, the modular approach requires careful selection of automation systems for physical and digital integration of different unit operations.",
        "Cell isolation is the first unit operation in hMSC manufacturing. The most common sources of hMSCs are bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AT), placenta (P), and umbilical cord (UC). In current clinical trials, bone marrow is the most widely used source of hMSCs followed by umbilical cord, adipose, and placenta (Pittenger et al., 2019). Currently, most of the cell isolation methods are manual or semi-automated followed by plating in either multiple T75/T175 cell culture flasks or cell stacks/cell factories depending on the starting cell numbers. Subsequently, the attached cells are harvested and cryopreserved as MCBs following standard critical quality attributes (CQA) testing. Furthermore, MCBs undergo a series of seed trains where post-expanded cells at the right passage are harvested and cryopreserved as working cell banks after CQA evaluation. Based on the CQAs, identifying the maximum passage limit with the same clinical efficacy as the earlier passages for each cell line is very important. This would identify the number of passage expansions and working cell banks required to achieve the maximal number of doses from a single vial of MCB. Depending on the starting hMSC source, there are potential gaps in the isolation methods that need to be addressed before adopting the entire workflow in a GMP facility.",
        "Typically for BM-MSCs isolation, manual Ficoll-based density gradient centrifugation of bone marrow aspirates is carried out to separate the mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction. Compared to manual MNC separation, automated Ficoll-based density gradient centrifugation devices such as Sepax C-Pro (Cytiva) can be used to generate clinical-grade MSCs from human bone marrow or cord blood with high recovery and less processing time (Aktas et al., 2008, 2010; Hanley et al., 2013).",
        "Conventionally, UC-MSCs are isolated from sections of perivascular tissue by two manual methods: (1) Direct explant culture technique. Although the procedure is straightforward, there are many challenging steps and contamination risks involved in handling the samples, and it is difficult to translate into an automation platform (Beeravolu et al., 2017). (2) Using a combination of mechanical dissociation with enzymatic degradation followed by filtration of undigested particles and direct culture of separated cell suspension (Smith et al., 2016). In line with the second method, a semi-automated approach of placental MSC isolation was carried out using sterile paddle blender bags containing pieces of intact placenta along with a cocktail of digestive enzymes. The semi-automated process yields were comparable while more importantly the processing time was significantly reduced to 1.5 h against 4–5 h using the manual method (Timmins et al., 2012).",
        "To isolate AD-MSCs, lipoaspirates or adipose tissue are mixed with an equal volume of saline; subsequent manual centrifugation of the lipid phase aspirates is enzymatically digested using collagenase followed by manual centrifugation to isolate stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Alternatively, without the need for enzymatic digestion, rapid isolation of AD-MSCs using the blood-saline portion of lipoaspirate was demonstrated through a simple five-step process (Francis et al., 2010). Güven et al. (2012) previously reported an automated procedure to isolate AD-MSCs from adult human lipoaspirates using Sepax C-Pro, and compared to manual separation, automation resulted in a 62% higher isolation yield and a 24% higher frequency of clonogenic progenitors. More recently, Rodriguez et al. (2017) reported that SVF isolated from adipose tissue using three semi-automated medical devices (GID SVF-1TM, PuregraftTM, and Stem.pras®) are equivalent to the reference manual method in terms of SVF yield, characteristics, and clonogenic potential.",
        "Alternatively, other automation devices such as spinning membrane-based filtration device (LOVOTM, Fresenius) (Wegener, 2014) and cell separation based on size using a counterflow centrifugation system (GibcoTM CTSTM RoteaTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) (Li et al., 2019; Dargitz et al., 2020) could be explored for non-Ficoll-based MNC isolation (BM-MSC), SVF wash and isolation (AD-MSC), and cord-tissue processing (UC-MSC) using the cited protocols. One other gap that needs to be highlighted here is the requirement and cost of different GMP-grade enzymes for digesting tissues from different sources. Interestingly, these alternatives or new-to-the-market bench-top closed automated cell processing systems could open more innovative ways to improve or simplify the existing protocols to maximize the isolation efficiency. Overall, we envision that the cell isolation process can be closed and automated as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Closed and automated cell isolation workflow. The list of cell processing devices and fill and finish instruments are shown in Tables 2, 3, respectively.",
        "Based on the ongoing clinical trial data, hMSCs are transfused intravenously at typical doses of 1–2 million cells/kg and in few cases not exceeding more than 12 million cells/kg (Galipeau and Sensébé, 2018), which is approximately 100–150 million cells/patient (Kabat et al., 2020). In addition, depending on the disease indications, the estimated hMSC dosage per patient might be from 15 million to 6 billion cells (Chen et al., 2013). Choosing a suitable scale-out or scale-up strategy for autologous and allogenic hMSC manufacturing (Figure 2) is critical to plan right at the beginning stage of small-scale process optimization. Depending on the scale needed, the manufacturer must identify a suitable closed and automated cell processing system that can connect directly to multi-layered flasks and bioreactors to perform volume reduction, wash, medium exchange, and formulation (Table 2). Most of the academic developers and advanced cell therapy companies fail to address this aspect, causing profound risks such as increased time and costs to repeat clinical trials shadowed by re-optimization of entire process workflow (Tania et al., 2016; James, 2017). Specifically, MSCs expanded under different culture conditions such as 2D monolayer or 3D microcarrier-based suspension system have an impact on their biological properties and functions, making process and technology changes difficult after clinical trials begin (Cherian et al., 2020; Levy et al., 2020).",
        "Schematic of the closed and automated hMSC manufacturing workflow. For the three methods listed below, the first step is to thaw the cryopreserved WCBs based on the required seeding density using a cell processing device to wash away cryopreserved media and exchange it with fresh expansion media. Depending on the technology chosen, it may be possible for the same cell processing device to be used for volume reduction, harvesting, passaging, and final formulation into bags for fill and finish. (A) 2D monolayer scale-out expansion using multi-layer systems. Processed cells can be transferred directly to a multi-layered flask for expansion. Next, the expanded cells after harvesting and volume reduction can be passaged directly in larger flasks until final harvest and formulation. (B) Scale-out expansion using hollow fiber membranes/multi-plate/packed-bed bioreactors. Typically, for hMSC manufacturing using the HF, MP, or PB bioreactors, two approaches can be adopted depending on the passage limit: (1) direct cell seeding into these bioreactors for cell expansion or (2) cell seeding into a 2D monolayer multi-layer device first before seeding into bioreactors. (C) Scale-up using microcarrier-based suspension culture in stirred-tank bioreactors. For this technology, two different closed and automated scale-up approaches can be used after cryopreserved WBCs are processed: (1) 2D–3D expansion: cells can be seeded and expanded first into 2D monolayer multi-layered flasks followed by seeding and expansion in 3D microcarrier-based suspension bioreactors. (2) 3D–3D expansion: cells can be seeded directly on 3D microcarriers for expansion in small-scale stirred tank bioreactor followed by seeding and expansion in large-scale stirred tank bioreactors. For in-line separation of microcarriers and cells, closed single-use systems such as the Harvestainer microcarrier separation system can be used for both smaller-scale and larger-scale applications.",

        "Currently, for large-scale manufacturing of hMSCs in 2D monolayer cultures, “scale-out” expansion is carried out using multi-layered cell stackers (Corning® CellSTACK and NuncTM Cell FactoryTM) through 1 layer to 40 layers. Mostly, these systems are equipped with dual ports closed by caps for filling and venting, respectively. Thus, for aseptic processing, these systems require a laminar hood for manual handling, which is not ideal for large-scale manufacturing. However, it can be completely closed by having a 0.2-μm pore, hydrophobic membrane filter in one of the ports to allow gas exchange without the risk of contamination, while the second port can be internally sealed using an aseptic connector that can be connected to media bags or cell processing instruments to allow direct fluid transfer via pumping or gravity. Figure 2A shows the schematic for a closed and automated 2D monolayer-based two passage, scale-out hMSC manufacturing. Although this method (Figure 2A) is the most cost-effective (Mizukami et al., 2018) and a preferred option for expanding hMSCs for clinical trials (Rowley et al., 2012), many bottlenecks still exist. It is not a scalable system as it requires a larger footprint for handling due to its restrictive surface-to-volume ratio, its non-homogenous expansion due to non-uniform surface coating resulting in batch-to-batch variability, it being laborious, and the fact that media exchange and cell harvesting can be impacted by the handling of multiple stackers at the same time (Cherian et al., 2020). Alternatively, GMP-compliant, closed automated and single-use systems may be suitable for hMSC manufacturing including hollow fiber-based (HF) continuous perfusion device, the Quantum cell expansion system from Terumo BCT (Hanley et al., 2014; Barckhausen et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2017; Frank et al., 2019; Vymetalova et al., 2020), 2D multiplate-based (MP) Xpansion® bioreactor system from Pall corporation (Rouard et al., 2020), and packed-bed (PB) iCeLLis® bioreactor from Pall corporation (Mizukami et al., 2018) (Figure 2B). Nonetheless, all of these systems (HF, MP, and PB) are better suited for autologous therapy or scale-out allogeneic therapy as they are limited by scalability, poor harvesting efficiency (especially PB), and the least cost-effective technology (Mizukami et al., 2018).",
        "3D microcarrier-based scale-up suspension system:",
        "On the contrary, microcarrier-based suspension culture using stirred tank bioreactors provides a high surface-to-volume ratio, enabling high-density cultures for large-scale allogenic hMSC manufacturing (Schnitzler et al., 2016). More importantly, microcarrier cultures are the most cost-effective in terms of COG/dose closely following 2D monolayer cultures or even surpassing if we optimize the harvesting efficiency (Mizukami et al., 2018). Many GMP-grade commercial microcarriers are available: cross-linked dextran-based Cytodex® 1 and 3 (Cytiva), SoloHill® polystyrene (Sartorius Stedim), and untreated or Synthemax II or CellBind-coated polystyrene (Corning®). On the single-use stirred-tank bioreactors, there are a variety of commercially available options (Mobius® from EMD Millipore, CelliGen® from Eppendorf, BIOSTAT® from Sartorius, HyPerformaTM from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Xcellerex® from Cytiva, and Allegro® from Pall) for different scales starting from bench-top (1–5 L) and large pilot scale (10–300 L) bioreactors (Schnitzler et al., 2016; Jossen et al., 2018). This microcarrier-based technology also has limitations, such as non-uniform binding during cell attachment, poor harvesting efficiency (∼60%) (Mizukami et al., 2018), and the need for an additional step to separate microcarriers and cells post-harvest. Thus, small-scale process optimization by pre-screening different microcarriers with different substrate coatings in the media of choice using shake flask or spinner flask is important to identify the top-performing microcarrier and further optimize attachment, expansion, and harvest parameters (aeration, impeller speed, and feeding regime) for the large-scale transition. To date, many reports have shown successful scale-up of hMSCs in small-scale and large-scale bioreactors (Timmins et al., 2012; Schirmaier et al., 2014; Cunha et al., 2017; Lawson et al., 2017; Bayne et al., 2019; Koh et al., 2020). In Figure 2C, we have shown the schematic of closed and automated hMSC manufacturing using both 2D to 3D and 3D to 3D expansion methods.",
        "As a last step in the entire manufacturing workflow, closed automated fill and finish is one of the most important cell therapy manufacturing processes primarily to ensure product safety, consistency, and integrity for longer-term storage (Brandon Fletcher et al., 2020). As such, cell therapy manufacturers need to be aware of the choice of equipment and the aseptic containers used for filling their products in a sterile and scalable manner. The most commonly used forms of containers are closed cryovials or cryobags. Some commercially available cryobags are multiple-chamber CryoStoreTM freezing bags (Origen), CryoMACS® Freezing Bags (Miltenyi Biotec), and Freeze-PakTM Bio-Containers (CharterMedical) with different fill volumes. Gao et al. (2019) reported that human AD-MSCs cryopreserved at -150°C for 24 months in cryobags post-thaw had a viability of >90% with minimal cell clumps with functionality profiles similar to fresh cells. In the case of cryovials, it has been reported that the seal integrity could be compromised for glass vials with rubber stoppers at cryogenic temperatures thus presenting problems of losing product integrity during the critical cryopreservation stage (Zuleger et al., 2012; Hunt, 2019). Alternatively, CellSeal® cryovial (Sexton Biotechnologies) made from USP Class VI material was reported to be stable and durable after 12 weeks of storing cryopreserved regulatory T cells with high cell recovery post-thaw (Fearnot et al., 2014). Aseptic technologies’ ready-to-fill AT-Closed Vial® is made up of a polymer body with a thermoplastic septum, and the filling process is simple and scalable (Hunt, 2019). Pharmaceutical-grade Daiko-Crystal Zenith plastic vial was found to be suitable for hMSC cryopreservation at either -85 or -196°C for 6 months, with post-thaw viability of >95% with comparable growth and differentiation profiles of fresh controls (Woods et al., 2010). Ideally, cryobags are used for large-volume and take a longer time for thawing, while the cryovials can be thawed rapidly because of lower fill volumes. For both cryobags and cryovials, slow freezing and rapid thawing are critical to protect the structural and functional integrity of the cells (Hunt, 2019). Overall, examples of commercially available fill and finish instruments are shown in Table 3. As listed, very few systems are available that have been designed to suit the specific needs of cell therapy. The challenge for manufacturers is to choose an optimal system, cryopreservation media, and containers that will suit their current needs but be scalable as they progress through the clinical trials and into commercial production.",
        "Closed automated fill and finish instruments.",
        "While we can physically integrate modular closed and automation systems for each of the unit operations, enabling digital integration using software platforms provides true automation across the entire autologous or allogenic hMSC end-to-end manufacturing workflow. In this complex environment, data logging the information through enterprise resource management (ERP) starting from sourcing of the raw materials, manufacturing process controls, quality management through to product storage and delivery to the patient is critical. This will ensure a proper flow of information ensuring traceability, which is a requirement for a GMP manufacturing. Building this foundation of cell therapy digital integration and data management enables the interaction of production (hardware and controllers) and control layers such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and manufacturing execution systems (MES). Moreover, the enterprise layer will facilitate interlinking the process and plant control for managing all aspects of clinical manufacturing. Data mining tools allow for the acquisition of upstream and downstream process batch record data and using this; real-time data analysis can be performed for different batches for rapid process optimization and troubleshooting. There are few automation transformation platforms that hMSC clinical manufacturers could leverage for integrating all bioprocess unit operations in a GMP biomanufacturing capacity (Supplementary Table 2).",
        "Taken together, it is extremely important to understand the existing process, COGS, and choose the best closed automation technologies suitable for unit operations that will seamlessly scale and transition to GMP manufacturing. For example, the hMSC manufacturers, depending on the scale, could choose cell stackers, or stirred tank bioreactors, etc. for incubation. Cell processing devices (Table 2), can be utilized for cell isolation, concentrating, washing cells, formulation, and then fill and finish into vials or bags using appropriate instrumentation (Table 3) that suits the preferred product format and number of doses. Note that cell processing systems will be used for multiple steps in the entire manufacturing workflow (Figures 1, 2) and the manufacturers need to evaluate each system individually to identify the best fit that works for their process. During this early stage evaluation, it is also important to qualify tubing compatibility and connector options to integrate instruments from several suppliers. Overall, hMSC manufacturers need to embrace the idea to design a GMP facility capable of flexible manufacturing using closed modular systems compatible with a digital connectivity platform to enable fully automated manufacturing.",
        "During each step of the unit operations starting from cell isolation through to final product cryopreservation and ensuing patient delivery, it is imperative that the cell product undergoes QC and monitoring, such as critical process parameters and critical material attributes, to ensure that CQAs are met for the end product, thereby maintaining product consistency in terms of quality and performance.",
        "Since the late 1960s, the US FDA has been establishing GMP guidelines for pharmaceuticals and has been periodically updating them (Immel, 2001). While those are useful for small-molecule drugs, it is almost impossible to apply those rules directly to our “living” drugs as we do not have a complete understanding of (1) the cells we work with and (2) the intricacy of the manufacturing process. Hence, regulators have developed new guidance with regular periodical updates for cell therapies.",
        "The mandatory CQAs for characterization include identity, purity, potency, and safety. Table 4 summarizes the main framework and requirements necessary for characterization testing. Of note, a review in 2017 observed that a substantial proportion of hMSCs trials did not result in publications; in particular, early stage trials were unsuccessful (Fung et al., 2017). Of those that did report their findings, a sizable number reported a lack of potency as a reason for not advancing their candidates (Fung et al., 2017). More importantly, manufacturing and non-manufacturing variables have been put forward as the possible cause for the discrepancy between previously observed efficacy in both In vivo and In vitro settings that differed from the clinical settings (Galipeau and Sensébé, 2018). An underlying reason for this is the inability to accurately predict critical hMSCs functions, such as its immunomodulatory activity properly define CQAs.",
        "Characterization/CQA for MSC therapy.",
        "Expectedly, much focus has been given to identity, purity, and potency, particularly during process development. The aspect of safety has been thought to be a step considered only at the final stage of manufacturing. However, to ensure that the final hMSC product is free of any adventitious agents, safety should be considered at each stage of the manufacturing process, starting from the selection of raw material as previously mentioned. Additionally, it is important to note that safety testing has three separate components, namely, sterility, mycoplasma, and adventitious virus testing that must be completed (Guadix et al., 2019).",
        "In this section, we describe what are the best practices as per literature in terms of hMSC characterization testing, and what should possibly be considered to overcome the current challenges in product quality assessment. Moreover, we suggest additional considerations that are being considered by the field that would improve hMSC product efficacy with regard to different clinical indications.",
        "While certain methods have been well established, it does not mean that they can be used directly across multiple utilities due to key differences between them. For example, flow cytometry assay for cellular identity is well accepted and multiple parameters still should be considered. These include but are not limited to the need for a reference control for specific cell surface markers and to overcome the subjective nature of the instrument type and operator gating strategies. Interestingly, standardized automated gating has been shown to improve the precision of the assay, which can be included as an established method (Suni et al., 2003).",
        "The immunomodulatory functions of hMSCs via the release of cytokines have been demonstrated to be a key mechanism in which they are utilized for the treatment of various clinical indications. This point has been highlighted in multiple reviews, which summarize the plethora of cytokines that have been demonstrated to be released by hMSCs, as well as their downstream regulatory functions (Kyurkchiev et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2016; Han et al., 2019). As such, it is critical to characterize the hMSC cytokine release profile and expression levels, to demonstrate potency and consistency in manufacturing.",
        "The testing of multiple cytokines individually for hMSCs would be costly, time-consuming, and ultimately impractical. However, the need for comprehensive characterization testing should not be a trade- off given its importance. As such, assays such as the multiplexed ELISA to test cytokine and growth factors residue for potency and purity are being considered (Ellington et al., 2010; Tighe et al., 2015). The attractiveness of this platform is that it allows for the concurrent quantification of multiple cytokines, at a fraction of the cost, relative to testing cytokines individually.",
        "Of note, while this platform has yet to be fully adopted in approved hMSCs therapy, its feasibility, however, has been shown in other approved therapeutics. Recent examples include the vaccine development for the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic. As part of BioNTech-Pfizer COVID-19 RNA vaccine, a Luminex assay was used (the ProcartaPlex) to test 11 different TH1 and TH2 cytokines concurrently (Sahin et al., 2020). Another example was the development of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel. This CAR T-Cell Therapy for Refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma employed a multiplex Luminex assay to measure seven different cytokines during their process development stage (Turtle et al., 2016). Hence, this is a platform that could be adopted for hMSCs as well. While some operational challenges are present, the benefits of such a platform warrant further looking into (Ellington et al., 2010; Tighe et al., 2015).",
        "A best practice is to develop a matrix of relevant assays that likely demonstrates the mechanism of action (MOA) of the hMSCs for the disease indication for which the MSCs are intended. This is appropriate, given that hMSCs could have a specific effect on certain clinical indications. For example, in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease, hMSCs’ immunomodulatory capacity via anti-inflammatory cytokines should be part of the matrix of the potency assays (Caplan, 2009). However, should the same cell product be used for neural regeneration, whereby the hMSCs can stimulate angiogenesis in nerves and motor function recovery, other potency assays would be more relevant (Masgutov et al., 2019). As such, the selection of specific clinical indication potency assays would be more relevant in not only demonstrating the MOA of the cells but also reducing the need to perform other irrelevant potency assays and thus save the effort and time driving lower COGS in product development.",
        "The necessity of performing characterization assay is not solely because it is a requirement, rather, it is to help the developer ensure that the development and manufacturing process is consistent, and the final product will function as intended. The US FDA further recommends that characterization testing be done during the early product development phase due to a large number of advantages it affords such as the ability to “Demonstrate product activity, quality and consistency throughout product development; evaluating product stability; provide a basis for assessing manufacturing changes,” etc. (FDA, 2011). Hence, characterization testing should be performed as a part of in-process testing instead of just being part of the release criteria.",
        "In addition to performing characterization assays early, it is also a good practice that such in-process testing should be done at key points of the manufacturing process, as well as critical risk areas for certain parameters. For example, when using frozen products, if it undergoes manipulation such as washing or culturing after thawing, it may be necessary to repeat the sterility test. This is more so if it is performed in open systems (FDA, 1998b). Moreover, concerning mycoplasma, two major sources in which contamination can occur are the culture facility: in particular open culture systems and the use of animal serum products (FDA, 1998a). It is recommended that mycoplasma testing be done at stages where cell pooling is involved to harvest cells or when there is an extended culture procedure (FDA, 1993).",
        "One key challenge in the development of successful therapy is due to hMSC therapy being “living” drugs. As such, they are fundamentally a heterogeneous population, whereby their gene and protein expression profiles can be entirely different from each other. Several studies have demonstrated that this heterogeneity is due to multiple parameters, such as hMSC origin source (Hass et al., 2011), the method of extraction (Juneja et al., 2016), as well as in vitro culture conditions and methods (Yin et al., 2019), just to name a few.",
        "As multiple parameters can affect hMSC functions, it stands to reason that more meaningful characterization assays should be employed (in addition to what is minimally needed) to certify that the final hMSC product has the necessary therapeutic activity (Chinnadurai et al., 2018). Indeed, more groups are looking to engineer more predictive characterization assays to ensure a greater correlation between the therapeutic activity and final product (Zhukareva et al., 2010; Chinnadurai et al., 2018; Russell et al., 2018). One such assay is the inhibition of activated CD4 + T-cells proliferation to measure hMSC immunomodulatory function. Given that this method allows for a phenotypic change to be measured, relative to surrogate measurements of cytokines such as TNF-α receptor expression, it is believed to be a more accurate representation (Bloom et al., 2015).",
        "Given the decades of hMSC research and clinical trials, we have an enormous database of gene expression data that thoroughly investigates almost every aspect of the hMSC transcriptome throughout every stage of the manufacturing process. Hence, studying this readily available treasure trove of data is extremely useful to properly elucidate the nature of hMSCs, their role in multiple diseases, and potential clinical indication via its mechanism of action (Pittenger et al., 2019).",
        "Indeed, one interesting transcription factor that was demonstrated to regulate hMSC effector function was Twist1 (Boregowda et al., 2016). Boregowda et al. (2016) observed that altering expression levels of Twist1 resulted in a corresponding change in hMSC potency in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Their team subsequently developed a CLinical Indications Prediction (CLIP) scale that could be used to prognosticate hMSC heterogeneity against hMSC effector function for multiple clinical indications. While this has the potential to be a useful tool for screening populations, more work should be done to establish it further.",
        "There is a need to accelerate the development of hMSCs therapy; hence, there is much focus on improving existing protocols of characterization of CQAs (Samsonraj et al., 2017).",
        "Concerning potency, as previously mentioned, the implementation of the multiplex ELISA to perform multiple cytokine measurements instead of single-target ELISA is being considered (Ellington et al., 2010; Tighe et al., 2015; Turtle et al., 2016; Sahin et al., 2020). For identity characterization, using gene expression assays such as TaqmanTM to replace standard Tri-lineage differentiation staining assay is another example. While the current Tri-lineage differentiation assay requires 2–3 weeks for the cells to differentiate followed by staining and imaging (Owston et al., 2019; Sanjurjo-Rodriguez et al., 2019; Rajpar and Barrett, 2020), newer methods such as the measurement of hMSC Tri-lineage gene expression following 1–2 weeks of differentiation reduces the time needed while providing quantitative information relative to the current method (Szepesi et al., 2016; Hwang et al., 2017; Ling et al., 2020).",
        "Once properly validated, these new assays would be used as an alternative to current methods. One such example is the characterization of safety, in particular, mycoplasma detection. Traditionally, the detection of mycoplasma was done via culture methods that typically require around 28 days. However, it is now accepted by regulators that mycoplasma detection can be done via PCR-based assay, which is cheaper and less time-consuming than the traditional method (FDA, 2010).",
        "While developing better potency assays would allow the detection and subsequent removal of suboptimal hMSCs, it would be far better to develop techniques that indicate hMSCs’ therapeutic potential. This concept is not lost on several companies that had improved on the current manufacturing process.",
        "One stage that was targeted was cryopreservation. A study showed that freshly thawed and washed hMSC had a large range in its viability (36–85%) (Matthay et al., 2019). This could be a result of cellular damage due to the cryopreservation stage in which a study observed that the process of cryopreservation affects the cytoskeleton (Chinnadurai et al., 2014). Of note, these detrimental changes to the hMSC physiology could lead to an increase in complement-mediated clearance (Moll et al., 2014), thereby significantly reducing its overall efficacy for the patient due to a decline in hMSC persistence in the system. In addition to viability and persistence, cryopreservation was also observed to reduce hMSC immunosuppressive function (Francois et al., 2012). Taken together, improving the cryopreservation process and characterizing the hMSC product before and after this stage is vital.",
        "While this has not been fully validated, there is some evidence that provides credence to this strategy in improving MSC quality. Take the most recent approved hMSC therapy Alofisel®. During its phase 3 clinical trial, they took into consideration the pitfalls of cryopreservation by including an additional process. Before administration, they thaw the cells and formulated 120 million cells in 24 ml of culture medium before shipping to the respective hospital as a formulated product that can be stored for 48 h (Panes et al., 2016). This allowed “recovery” of freshly thawed product and selection of viable cells to occur, addressing the issue observed above. While this is promising, more studies would have to be done to further validate this strategy.",
        "Despite decades of research showing hMSC clinical potential and a vast number of hMSC clinical trials covering an array of indications, only a handful of hMSC products (Ancans, 2012) have been approved for market authorization globally compared to the large number of ongoing clinical trials that meet the safety requirements (Jahani et al., 2020).

A host of reasons go into the factor of why we see this trend, such as regulatory burdens due to high-risk raw material selection, failure to show product consistency and efficacy, cost of manufacturing, and open system processing. To overcome this, manufacturers need to start with the end goal in mind. First, choosing high-quality, low-risk raw materials with all the necessary QC/safety testing and regulatory support documentation is an utmost priority. Qualification of whether these raw materials can be supplied in a secure and scalable manner is essential to sustainability. Second, the evaluation of scalable closed and automated solutions must be done upfront during the early process development stage. Changes in scale and automation solutions are unavoidable because novel technologies will be developed in the future to address the current challenges. This process flexibility can only be adopted if the manufacturing workflow is modular in design. Third, it is empirical to test CQAs at every step of the manufacturing unit operations starting from the isolation step of hMSC, creation of MCBs and WCBs, to final product scale-up/scale-out expansion, before fill and finish and post-thawing of the cryopreserved product. Lastly and most importantly, there is no “one size fits all” approach for hMSC therapy regulatory guidance.

Traditionally, product control strategies have focused on testing known quality attributes with limits derived from levels administered in preclinical and clinical studies with an associated statistical analysis to account for variability. However, not all quality attributes have impact to the patient and those with the potential to impact safety and efficacy may not be significant when dosed at patient-centric levels. Therefore, achieving patient-centricity is understanding patient relevance, which is defined as the level of impact that a quality attribute could have on safety and efficacy within the potential exposure range. A patient-centric quality standard (PCQS) is therefore a set of patient relevant attributes and their associated acceptance ranges to which a drug product should conform within the expected patient exposure range.

      "body": [
        "The introduction of the Quality by Design concept in 2004 has brought a paradigm shift in the pharmaceutical industry as well as a new era in pharmaceutical research and development [1]. This concept offers higher flexibility in production while reducing manufacturing costs [2] through the application of a complex risk-based approach from the beginning of the early development phase until the end of the product lifecycle.",
        "The Quality by Design concept is a highly multidisciplinary field, as the implementation of the many aspects of this complex approach requires the use of versatile methodology and a wide range of tools, from understanding the patients’ needs [3], through the proper design of experiments [4,5], to advanced process analytical technologies [6,7], multivariate data analysis, and machine learning [8]. The papers published in this Special Issue well represent the broad applicability of this concept.",
        "Sadamoto et al. focused on the fulfillment of patient needs with the development of a child-resistant but senior-friendly packaging (contribution 1). Their paper discusses the applicability of and cost-effectiveness of different materials that could be used for the manufacturing of press-through packages with the aim of creating packaging that is completely child-resistant but still applicable for older patients with rheumatoid arthritis or another strength impairment.",
        "Sun et al. provided an analytic-focused paper that discusses the applicability of Raman mapping for reverse engineering purposes in generic drug development (contribution 2), which may offer a new way to better understand the structure and release mechanism of the original formula, reduce development time, and increase the success of product development.",
        "Other papers in this Special Issue have focused on process optimization; for example, Lück et al. (contribution 3) critically evaluated the Johanson model and the derived Midoux number used for the mathematical prediction of ribbon solid fraction during roll compaction and investigated the effect of the roll speed on their prediction accuracy. They concluded that the roll speed exerts a significant influence on the obtained results and should be included in future models to increase the accuracy of predictions.",
        "In addition to the application of mechanistic mathematical models, the most commonly used method in process optimization is the application of the design of experiments and response surface methodology (RSM). Alrobain et al. used it effectively for the improvement of tablettability of a poorly compactable and high-drug loading composition by optimizing the amount and mixing time of a nanosized colloidal silica excipient (contribution 4). Nevertheless, the versatility of this methodology is well demonstrated by the fact that the same research group effectively also utilized it in the optimization of the composition of sildenafil containing orodispersible minitablets (contribution 5) and for the determination of the design space of a green fluidized bed granulation process, which aimed to decrease water and energy consumption while keeping the optimized granule properties (contribution 6). The same methodology was employed by Németh et al. for the optimization of the zeta potential of liposomes (contribution 7) and by Frankiewicz and Szintowska for the optimization of a film coating process (contribution 8). Nevertheless, this latter research well demonstrated that the RSM may require many experiments, especially if the process parameters should be tested for multiple formulations. Nevertheless, the study of Hassan et al. (contribution 9), and Žiberna and Grabnar (contribution 10), which aimed to optimize a plain buccal mucoadhesive film, which was later successfully applied for the delivery of various drugs, and the development of olanzapine containing oral lyophilizates, respectively, showed that the proper evaluation and risk assessment of the existing knowledge space can effectively help in the determination of the most important factors and decrease the required number of experiments.",
        "However, the study by Pielenhofer et al. (contribution 11) displays well that although the utilization of a proper risk assessment may effectively decrease the size of the experimental plan, the final number of experiments may still be high if the aim is not the better understanding of a certain production step but the development of an investigational product, whose production might consist of multiple consecutive manufacturing steps. The paper by Šahinović et al. (contribution 12) also faced similar problems and utilized an iterative optimization process to resolve them and decrease the final number of experiments.",
        "Finally, the paper by Romero-Obon et al. (contribution 13) describes a new methodology for using retrospective data to narrow the number and range of variables.",
        "The Guest Editors express their gratitude for the cooperation of the contributors, who are reputable researchers in this field and, with their published papers, helped to reveal the different aspects, provide a better understanding of the concept of pharmaceutical quality by design, and provide useful tools and methodology for conducting further research in this field.",

        "Regenerative medicine products are designed to replace or regenerate a specific target site to normal function, and in some conditions provide a cure. Cell-based therapies (CBT) are a subset of regenerative products composed of living cells which are transplanted into a donor or recipient to address unmet medical needs (Petricciani et al., 2017). The potential of these therapies has extended beyond scientific research to commercialization and broader market use. Hence, regulatory bodies across jurisdictions have continually established and published regulations and guidelines to evaluate CBT based on their perceived risk, and have utilized a risk-based classification style to categorize them as either medical procedures or biological drug products (FDA, 2017; A, (2008). EMA, 2008; PMDA, 2004).Taiwan’s cell therapy regulation is harmonized with that of the United States and Europe. However, in order to promote patient’s access to CBT due to demands for innovative treatments as well as the interest of cell therapy developers, the government adopted a dual track regulation for CBT products from Japan in 2018. The framework includes the “Regulation Governing the Application of Specific Medical Examination Technique and Medical Device” (RASMET) also known as the “Special Regulation for Cell Therapy” under the medical care act and “Regenerative Medicinal Product Management Act” solely under the pharmaceutical affairs act (CHEN, 2019; Tsai et al., 2020) which jointly promote the development of regenerative medicine. The “Special Regulation for Cell Therapy” was designed to govern the use of CBT as a technique for medical practice to promote clinical innovation across approved medical institutions for patients with specific medical indications. Thus, medical institutions need to fulfill these requirements:1) Certification of operating physicians who are specialists in the field of the diseases for which cell therapy is to be applied.2) The completion of training courses on regulations, ethics, cell processing unit management, and adverse event reporting by the operating physicians.3) The physician’s previous participation in human clinical trial for the specific cell therapy technique intended for application.",

        "3) The physician’s previous participation in human clinical trial for the specific cell therapy technique intended for application.",
        "Furthermore, institutions are required to hold the certification of standardized GTP (Good Tissue Practice) facility. Few medical institutions own a standardized facility while others collaborate with and obtain processed CBT products from GTP facilities owned by industries. In addition, a treatment plan is also required, all of which needs to be submitted to the regulatory authority, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MoHW). Although, industries process these products. Both medical institutions and physicians are responsible for the risk of these products, and are thus considered medical technologies under the special regulation.",
        "Within the context of this regulation, the MoHW has approved 6 types of autologous CBT (technologies) considered low risk based on their expected/predictable efficacy and accumulated safety profiles for specific indications, and do not require investigational new drug application (IND) market approval (Chen, 2016; CHEN, 2019) (Table 1; Figure 1). However, CBT products (technologies) from autologous sources not included in the approved list requires clinical evidence before being granted an approval (Figure 2). For this purpose, the MoHW established and authorized two review committees to oversee the use of these CBT technologies in medical practice. One of the committees reviews the proposals focusing on the scientific basis and the treatment plan of the specific CBT products while the other committee reviews the consumer price of the CBT treatment. Each of the committees includes experts from scientific, clinical, statistics, legal, and bioethics fields.",

        "A step-wise process of approval for medical practice and products. For medical practice, the safety of a listed cell technology is reviewed by the cell therapy committee for approval. Once its efficacy is confirmed, such cell technology can be turned into a routine practice. Otherwise, it will be annulled. For unlisted cell technology, it needs to undergo clinical testing before being approved by the committee for cell therapy as a medical practice. Regenerative products or biologics need to undergo a stepwise clinical testing from phase I-III before being granted a market authorization. However, a conditional approval of 5 years is allowed after preliminary safety and efficacy results are provided.",
        "To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the approved CBT products and in consideration of their reported varied efficacy, an annual mandatory review process to monitor adverse events or abnormal side effects has also been included in the regulation. Such review entails the submission of a report covering all treated cases and treatment effects to the MoHW for future amendments to the list of approved CBT products as well as to create public awareness of the risks-benefits for transparency purposes. Thus, the accessed risks-benefits from routine evaluations determines whether an approved CBT product can be turned into a routine medical practice or annulled.",
        "The “Regenerative Medicinal Product Act” (still in draft), on the other hand, and was designed to manage regenerative products. Hence, the act governs high risk products including cells, genes, and medical devices (combinations of cells and medical devices). The use of embryonic stem cells in research is governed by the “Code of Ethics for Embryonic Stem Cell Research” and the “Guidelines for Ethical Policy on Human Embryo and Embryonic Stem Cell Research” in Taiwan. However, because induced pluripotent stem cells are derived from somatic cells, it is thus excluded from embryonic stem cell controversies. Therefore, the clinical use or application of induced pluripotent stem cells are thus governed by the regulations on human cell products clinical trial, and Genetic Recombinant Experiment Regulation (FC, 2020).The regulatory authority, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA), oversees the manufacturing of regenerative products under the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) standards, and the conduct of clinical trials for regenerative products while the Center for Drug Evaluation provides consultation advice and assists in the review of medicinal products (Figure 3). Thus, the medicinal product act requires an application for both investigational new drugs, and market approval. Furthermore, a distinct pathway which permits conditional approval (for unmet medical needs) of cell-based products for market authorization of 5 years based on safety and preliminary efficacy data. This pathway requires robust clinical data from a phase II clinical trial provided by sponsors, and thus considered for initial approval after which sponsors must conduct confirmatory clinical trials from phase III to validate the clinical benefit otherwise the conditional approval will be withdrawn. There are currently no cell products approved under this act. However, numerous clinical trials are underway.",

        "The government has prioritized biomedicine at the forefront of its biomedical industry innovation scheme to position the country as a hub for biotechnologies (Chen, 2016). This initiative placed significant emphasis on the development of high end therapies including regenerative medicine and cell-based therapies. One such effort is the enactment of the current regulatory framework which includes a complimentary effort that allows for clinical innovation, and was expected to accelerate the development of regenerative medicinal products However, no cell therapy products have been approved for marketing thus far. According to the literature, the slow pace of CBT development may be due to scientific, and legal or regulatory challenges amongst others (Kemp, 2006; Mason, 2007). Hence, to understand this, we explored the opinions of experts collectively involved in medical practices under the purview of the “Special Regulation for Cell Therapy” to understand their perspectives and the challenges to such practices. The resulting perspectives could influence regulatory authorities’ development of strategies that could accelerate the development of cell-based therapies.",
        "We searched and reviewed information on all approved cell therapy technologies under the special regulation for cell therapy including the medical institutions on the Ministry of Health and Welfare Website. We then analyzed the number of approved institutions, the conditions for which these technologies are mostly applied, and the percentage of medical institutions approved to use each of the cell technologies (Figure 4).",

This sampling technique common in qualitative research aims to select participants who can provide rich and in-depth information rather than generate generalizable data. Forty-nine email invitations were sent, and sixteen participants agreed to be interviewed. We aimed to explore expert’s perceptions of the special regulation for cell therapy, the implementation challenges, and respondent’s recommendations. To address our research questions, the interview questions were designed, and organized around these areas. We sent the interview guide prior to our meeting with each of the respondents. All respondents consented to the study through written informed consent, after being provided with the details of the study, and measures for maintaining their confidentiality. Accordingly, 11 in-person and 5 online (telephone) interviews were conducted lasting between 30–60 min each. No incentives were offered to any of the participants. These interviews were conducted individually between February and October 2021.",
        "The interviews were conducted and audio recorded by BAA and subsequently transcribed verbatim before being imported into the data management software ATLAS.ti (Version 8; scientific software Development, Berlin, and Germany) by BAA. BAA and MKS conducted an inductive thematic analysis as described by Braun and Clarke (Braun and Clarke, 2006) to identify themes within respondent’s narratives. According to this approach, the first step entails familiarization with the interview through reading, and re-reading the interview text. During this time, BAA began developing a coding framework which was expanded as needed as the transcript were coded. Then, BAA, and MKS began the analysis, formulating codes to the textual data based on sentences that are relevant to the study. A code book was created and reviewed, as we openly coded each of the interview transcript. We further collapsed the codes into groups with related patterns, and then into larger categories after which BAA, MKS, and CHL met to discuss, agree, and reach a consensus on the categories. Finally, each theme was named and the report was drafted. We ensured the emergent themes are well grounded in the data by critically reviewing each of the themes against the transcripts to uphold credibility. Exemplar quotes were assigned for illustrative purpose.",
        "An analysis of cell therapy projects indicated that over the past 3 years, autologous cells that involve using a patient’s own cells were approved for use across medical institutions under the special regulation for cell therapy. These cells were categorized based on their level of manipulation. Therefore, the types of cells permitted were; 1) cells that have undergone simple separation and purification steps, and thus implant directly such as Hematopoietic stem cells 2) cells that have been expanded and cultured in GTP approved laboratories. These include immune cells, mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblast, and chondrocyte, etc (excluding genetically modified or combination therapy of cells and devices), which have been allowed for use in tissue regeneration and cancer treatment. (Table 1). As of October 2021, a total of seventy-nine 79) medical institutions have been granted approval to use any of the listed cell technologies most of which address cancer (Figure 3). Furthermore, cytokine induced killer cells (CIK) is the most used, and applied technique amongst all approved medical institutions.",
        "Sixteen respondents participated in the interview portion of this study; including (9 physicians who are specialist in oncology, neurology, pediatrics, orthopedics, and 2 physician’s assistant across 8 medical institutions) (4 experts across four cell processing units and industries) and a review official. Of the sixteen respondents, 13 of them (81.2%) were male and 3 of them were female (18.7%). Most respondents were highly educated with 12 of them (75%) holding PhD degree, and 2 of them (12.5%) holding an MSc degree in addition to their undergraduate degrees. Three major themes and four subthemes emerged from this qualitative analysis: 1) Respondent’s perceptions of the “Special Regulation for Cell Therapy” 2) Emerging issues and controversies on medical use of cell technologies in private clinics, and 3) Challenges impeding the clinical innovation of cell technologies which include the efficacy and cost of autologous therapies, regulatory demands, and clinical outcome evaluation and review.",
        "Most of the respondents commended the TFDA for structuring the current regulation for CBT, as this was considered “new technology” with restricted use in many countries. Respondents understood the regulation to be an indispensable strategy to ensure progressive effort on CBT development in Taiwan, hence the regulation was interpreted as being in a nascent stage. Some of the respondents reported that the initiation of this regulation was influenced by patient advocacy groups. Therefore, the clinical use of CBT was perceived as hope for patients. Hence, the limitation on the approved cells, and intended diseases was impelled by safety concerns to protect patients. Respondents were optimistic about the future of cell therapy with high expectations regarding what seems like an ideal cell therapy treatment as described:",
        "“Cell therapy is the future. It is the future and it is very important. It will be very important in medicine, but it’s just beginning now. I think the TFDA also wants to open this window for cell therapy. However, their concern is the safety, so they will open step by step.” (Physician)",
        "Some respondents felt that the preceding cell therapy regulation governing multiple phases of trials limited physician’s hands–on–experiences while others considered it as ‘unfit’ for CBT. Hence, preference was given to the “Special Regulation for Cell Therapy” by some respondents, as it provides an avenue for physicians to develop proficient skills which are essential during clinical trials, as well as those needed for the standardization of cell quality, and the development of smaller biotech companies. On the other hand, others considered the regulation unsuitable for clinical evidence and scientific rigor crucial for CBT development. One respondent expressed concerns over the difficulty that might be faced by the government in balancing the scientific and commercial aspects of CBT, emphasizing that the benefit of CBT to patients should be considered a priority, as clinical evidence is needed to reveal the best treatment for patients. Thus, respondents suggested that clinical trials should be encouraged to provide more concrete scientific evidence for long-term benefits to patients as this quotation clearly notes:",
        "“For promoting practice, for promoting, research, you can do this under this special regulation with this, you cannot really prove [that] your product [is effective]. You [are] just giving people hope I certainly do not reject this special regulation because it’s more like giving people [the] chance to try. So, you can link this to the idea of the right to try argument.” (Reviewer)",
        "Some respondents felt Taiwan lags behind other countries in CBT development due to having stricter regulations. Contrarily, others described the regulation as lax owing to the exclusion of rigorous trials. Unprompted, a respondent felt that the government’s decisions on regulatory policies were informed by scientific findings from other countries as described:",
        "“I don’t know why maybe they think it [is]… dangerous to use cells for humans. So, they [are] afraid, they are afraid to allow the company … [to] use them in human. I think the [government used] scientific findings from other countries to support their decisions.” (Physician)",
        "Respondents tended to attribute the slow pace of cell therapy development to the strictness of the regulation, as they believed the government is concerned about patient safety.",
        "Some respondents perceived the use of CBT in private clinics to be illegal according to the regulations. Contrarily, others felt the regulation permitted private clinics to use these technologies as parts of medical institutions. In an effort to improve oversight on cell therapies, the government recently proposed to allow the practice of cell therapy in private clinics. Yet, whether or not such practice should be allowed in these clinics has remained controversial. Most of the respondent’s perceptions were based on safety and risk management. For clinics to be permitted, most respondents felt the cell techniques should be lower in risk as there are lack of proper facilities or teams to care for patients in case of serious adverse events. However, others agreed with the idea due to a need for clinical evidence to promote the development of CBT. Another area of concern centered on the importance of scientific knowledge on the part of physicians who are involved in private practice, as one respondent described such knowledge as critical to ensure patient safety. Thus, inspection of activities, including the cell processing units and the expertise of physicians to ensure patient safety were suggested.",
        "Respondents identified four challenges faced in the clinical development of cell-based therapies in Taiwan.",
        "The limited types of autologous cells approved for clinical use in medical institutions was considered sufficient by some respondents, while others perceived this to be a strong barrier, and as they hoped cell therapy could be approved for diseases for which conventional treatments are ineffective. From the interviews, it is apparent that the approved autologous cells did not live up to the expectations of both the respondents and patients, and considering that an overwhelming number of respondents expressed their dissatisfaction regarding the treatment outcome having previously treated their patients with autologous cell therapies. One respondent described:",
        "“So, the autologous cells might not be so perfect but this is the only current useable … [cell source] under this regulation.” (Physician)",
        "The majority of the respondents who reported dissatisfaction were oncologist. Some of whom perceived autologous cancer immunotherapies as insufficient for late-stage patients, but they predicted a greater chance of success for those in the early stages of cancer:",
        "“I think the challenge [is], for the so called non-advanced cancer, for example, and stage 1 or early cancer. Is it possible to use adjuvant cell therapy? Is it rational? The solid cancer has no guideline [for] cell therapy use [in] HCC [hepatocellular carcinoma], breast cancer and pancreatic cancer, and there is no such suggestion. So, I think this is the challenge. If patients [those in the early stag] say, I have money, I want to do cell therapy, can you ... [Offer me]? I say no”. (Physician)",
        "Both physicians and industry experts recognized that the efficacy could be influenced by factors such as cancer types and status, the patients condition (e.g., age, compromised immune system), and chemotherapy interference, which could also influence the quality and freshness of CBT as described by a respondent.",
        "“Because the cancer patients have been treated with chemotherapy … you cannot collect enough of [their] blood … sometimes the lymphocyte quality … or NK [Natural killer cells] ratio is very low... In that case, it is very difficult for us to get [a] very good quality product.” (Industry personnel)",
        "Thus, current methods used to address the cell processing issue involves close team work with physicians for proper timing of chemotherapeutic treatments in the case of immunotherapies, and as some of these cells do not have the ability to tolerate the condition of freezing and thawing. As such, they do need to be freshly cultured to maintain their quality. Cells derived from adipose tissue, however, were stated to have standardized procedures of extraction but quality control still remains a challenge in developing all of these products. Furthermore, the uncertain efficacy led some of the experts to seek alternatives as well as influence government decisions on amending approved cells. With this, some respondents were optimistic about chimeric antigen Receptor-T cells and allogeneic cells, considering their efficacy outcome and approval for certain indications in other parts of the world. However, others cautioned about the risk of these alternatives. Finally, many of the respondents suggested that the authorities need to be open-minded by approving more cell types, and disease indications when conventional treatment is ineffective, while also being cautious.",
        "Respondents revealed that registries were created to monitor the practice of cell therapy which could benefit regulatory decisions on approved cell therapies. They indicated the necessity of monitoring adverse events and efficacy of regenerative products, as cell therapy is still immature. One of the respondents described:",
        "“I think it’s necessary [annual review mechanism] because actually [whether] it is cell therapy or product … it is not mature right now. So, even a pharmaceutical drug has what we call phase IV [clinical trial] after you sell the product, and you have to [review what was approved].” (Physician)",
        "Preference was shown for electronic collection of data with emphasis on its usefulness in building data banks, which could, in turn, promote Taiwan’s global competitiveness in terms of data storage. The electronic case form was designed for specific diseases. Hence, some respondents expressed concern over the design due to its tendency to introduce statistical bias, and particularly for stage 4 cancer patients who had received different standards of care before CBT. Simplification and specification of electronic forms were suggested to enhance statistical analysis for better efficacy evaluation. In addition, the establishment of a suitable electronic reporting systems by stem cell companies was suggested, and as the form was described as being in its infancy. A respondent stated:",
        "“It is better to ask patients or doctors to report their practice … It’s better to have a special form like the electronic forms so that we can report everything and once you get this data you can analyze every doctor’s results [and] patients’ benefits. The report form is [in the] very early stage.” (Physician)",
        "The difficulty of characterizing the effectiveness and analyzing outcomes in combination treatments of chemotherapy and autologous cell transplant were also a concerns raised by respondents. Hence, they were skeptical about the success of the review mechanisms as they believed it might not give a clearer endpoint akin to clinical trials. There were, however, contrasting opinions as to whether this challenge exists in clinical trials particularly in oncology. For some respondents, the idea of the annual review mechanism gives the impression of a clinical trial due to the detailed record-keeping and supervision involved. However, this perception was contrasted by other respondents who indicated that stringency is necessary. There were contrasting opinions as to how long review follow-ups should be done to relieve the government from frequent reviews despite the consensus on the need to review the clinical use of CBT. The lack of resources and support in data collection was considered a challenge, rendering the process onerous and potentially even detrimental to the field as this respondent described:",
        "“Because it’s a new field for [the] hospital, even though we have doctors, nurses and we have some cancer registry staff but everybody is not familiar with cell therapy and … what you have to do [is not understood by everyone]. So, everybody is new in this field … and there seems [to be] a lot of things to do and there seems to be a lot to report[s]. So, not so many people want to touch this field.” (Physician)",
        "However, another respondent indicated that study nurses responsible for data collection also act as middlemen between doctors, companies, and patients. The respondent, however, did not comment on how this arrangement may affect the nurses and their other responsibilities.",
        "Many respondents perceived the cost of autologous cell therapy as burdensome to patients. Some respondents felt the source of starting material of CBT determines the cost of cell therapy. However, others considered the high cost of autologous therapies to reflect the cost of all new drugs. Many respondents believed that high the cost of cell therapy was a result of the manufacturing standards and the patient-specific nature of autologous treatments. A respondent commented that high cost could be justified only if autologous therapies were more effective but currently, these therapies are still in the experimental phase. Currently, however, unaffordable prices may deter patients from seeking cell therapies as patients are not accustomed to paying out of pocket because Taiwan has a national health-care service that covers the majority of patients expenses. Furthermore, some respondents felt the national health care services was a poor adopter of innovation. A respondent described:",
        "“In Taiwan, I think it’s very difficult to make progress under this insurance because there’s no support for innovation because innovation needs money” (Physician).",
        "Some respondents believed the consequence of high manufacturing standards could lead to the proliferation of unregulated practices amongst companies abetted by patients who may not be able to afford these therapies. Others seemed hopeful for government strategies, industry competition, mass production of allogeneic cells and insurance coverage to address the high costs of these therapies.",
        "Medical institutions have no experience and experts to handle regulatory affairs. Moreover, a respondent mentioned that regulatory personnel in biotech companies have little knowledge about regulatory compliance. Therefore, respondents indicated that there is a need to incorporate regulatory studies for science students across institutions.",
        "“The regulatory education is not in the system basically. I don’t know if it is there outside of Taiwan but in Taiwan, we basically learn zero knowledge [about] regulatory compliance or something like that … So these people [life science and biology students] enter industry and solely become the manager or leader of the company but they don’t really have the tools or the sense for the regulation.” (Industry personnel)",
        "Regulatory demands were perceived as difficult which often lead to disputes between cell developers and the regulators. It is believed that inadequate scientific knowledge about innovative therapies due to the rapid pace of their developments, in addition to the small market size, and the lesser number of applications reviewed as compared to their international counterparts (i.e., the USFDA) could be a reason for the longer approval times for the clinical testing of products. On the other hand, under the context of the special regulation, some respondents felt that the frequent testing and validation for autologous cell processing, and the use of GMP clinical-grade reagents are expensive. They acknowledged the enormous reviewing responsibility of the review committee on applications from various medical institutions but raised a concern on the criteria used in evaluating each of the applications. However, the challenges faced by the reviewers centers on the difficulty to evaluate qualified protocols and the measure of preparedness of physicians and their cooperated companies. Thus, reviewers are skeptical about what to approve as described:",
        "“We are also not sure what will happen if it is really applied to the patients ... Could there be any harm, serious side effect or not effective at all and patients complain … So, things like that could happen, we can imagine … or the patient got this treatment then has some infection, some serious side effect, things like that.” (Reviewer)",
        "Regulatory ambiguities and the probing nature of regulatory officials was considered a negative influence on their relationship as they audit their cell processing units and procedures during site inspections. Some respondents believed the major concern is safety which compelled regulators and reviewers to protect patients from harm while focusing on benefits. However, one respondent from the industry revealed the continuous effort of regulators to raise the manufacturing standards, such as from GTP to GMP but cautioned it could stall commercial development of CBT due to the high cost of maintenance. Therefore, respondents indicated that the challenges faced by regulators and reviewers include; balancing patient safety and the commercial development of CBT which impacts the time it takes to evaluate and approve applications. A respondent described their challenge with the review committee:",
        "“[A] committee needs to check your project, it takes a long time, and sometimes the committee [challenge applications the same way when you] submit your paper [for publication]. Even, if you have nothing … [that should be challenged] they... [feel the] need to challenge something.” (physician’s assistant)",
        "Training and recruitment of regulatory staff who understands critical points about CBT was suggested by some respondents. Others emphasized the need for regulatory clarity, educational resources on regulatory standards, early communication, and shorter approval times.",
        "In the United States, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) established a three-tiered regulatory framework, which indicates an increasing level of oversight as the risk of CBT increases, falling either within the “351 or 361” category based on the Public Health Service Act, and 21 Code of Federal Regulation (Table 2) (U.s.f.a.d. Administration, 2007). The regulation exempted and designated 361 products as minimally manipulated cells, which only require listing and registration with the FDA. Similar to the United States, the EU has also adopted a risk based approach by exempting minimally manipulated cells regarded as “cells intended for human application” under the Directives 2004/23/EC (Commission Directive (EU), 2015). However, unlike the 361 products in the United States, they do not require listing and registration. The EU also have an additional exemption known as hospital exemption (HE) which permits the use of advanced medicinal therapy products across medical institutions.",
        "Regulatory model for clinical innovation across different jurisdictions.",
        "MoHW, Ministry of Health and Welfare; TFDA, Taiwan Food and Drug Administration; MLHW, Ministry of Health, Labor Welfare; MFDS, Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, USFDA, United States Food and Drug Administration; CAT, Committee for Advanced Therapies; EMA, European Medicines Agency.",
        "Contrary to the United States and EU regulatory frameworks, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea use a dual track regulatory framework to regulate CBT for medical practice and product Japan permits the use of processed cells (more than minimally manipulated cells) and does not exclude non-homologous use in medical practice under the Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine (ASRM) (Table 2). Unlike Japan, Taiwan approved only 6 categories of minimal to none manipulated autologous cells for specific indications under the special regulation for cell therapy (CHEN, 2019). However, similar to Japan’s ASRM, non-homologous use was not excluded. The use of minimal manipulated cells from both autologous and allogeneic sources was approved for medical practice in Korea. However, the health authorities deems it fit to consider minimal manipulated cells as products requiring a pre-market authorization; if the manufacture of such cells take place outside of medical institutions (Han and Shin, 2015). In China, cell therapy is regulated in the broad category of stem cell therapy regulated under the Administrative Measures of Clinical Research for Stem Cell (AMSC 2015) or somatic cell therapy regulated under the Management of Clinical Research and Transformation Applications for Somatic Cell Therapy MSCT 2019 (Wu et al., 2020). Thus, both stem cell therapy and somatic therapy independently have a dual track framework for clinical research and clinical application in medical institutions as well as market authorization for biological products, which is jointly regulated under the Guidance for Research and Evaluation of cellular therapy products (Wu et al., 2020).",
        "In general, substantially manipulated cells are considered products and are regulated differently in all of these jurisdictions, but all commonly require clinical testing. Furthermore, market authorization also varies in all of these jurisdictions. For example, a time-limited condition approval for market authorization is required in Japan (7 years) (Konomi et al., 2015), Taiwan and Korea (5 years) (Lim, 2015; CHEN, 2019).These countries also have similar pathways initiated to expedite the approval process of CBT but differ in their names and prerequisite. Regardless, designing a suitable regulation to accommodate CBT as well as the harmonization of such effort has been a global challenge (Aly, 2020). Considering the position of the United Kingdom and Japan as front runners in the development of regenerative medicine, Taiwan can improve their process in the areas of infrastructure and human capital development described as follows:",
        "Currently, there are no large-scale manufacturing plant to cater for RM. Taiwan could learn from the United Kingdom by providing more physical infrastructure which would help enhance RM. Although a plant is being built in Hsinchu (Intralink 2020), more would be essential with numerus manufacturing clean rooms to increase manufacturing capacity. This would make it easier for companies to hire these plants rather than having to build their own GMP facility. In addition, regional hubs or centers similar to the United Kingdom Advanced Therapy Treatment Centers (Umemura and Morrison, 2021) could be established to promote clinical delivery and foster a mutual collaboration between clinicians, biomedical scientists and small biotech companies.",
        "Since skill development is crucial for the development of RM, it is essential to focus on improving human capital. Similar to the United Kingdom and Japan, Taiwan can also incorporate courses and certification that includes cell culture techniques, bioethics, and safety for specialist or technologist in RM.",
        "This study explored the views and concerns of experts on the special regulation of CBT and the challenges hindering medical practices in Taiwan. Despite recent reform of the regulatory framework, respondents still perceive the development of these therapies as challenging. Having implemented the special regulation, some felt its conservative feature which permits only six (6) types of autologous cells and the limited indications have impacted the progress of such development. They also have varied opinions regarding the level of oversight needed by the health authorities which they assume contributes to the pace of these developments. Some perceived the regulation as strict having considered the development status in other countries in addition to the quality standards imposed by the authorities. Others felt it is lenient as scientific evidence is vital to these developments. But for most of the respondents, the regulation was considered experimental, and as such they emphasized the need for improvements and hoped to accumulate more experience as they continue to develop cell-based products.",
        "The previous regulatory model which considered cell therapy as product without any other expedited developmental pipeline as well as the lack of funds to complete a product life cycle was regarded as challenging by many cell therapy developers (Plagnol et al., 2009; Dodson and Levine, 2015; Chen et al., 2017). Additionally, many patients who do not fit into trials were known to seek unregulated treatments from other countries (medical tourism) which poses serious risk to patients and lack of follow–up evaluations (Matthews and Iltis, 2017). To protect the public from potential harm, the special regulation addresses: 1) the issue of stem cell tourism by promoting patient access to cell treatment for diseases for which conventional treatments are ineffective; 2) safety concerns by implementing annual adverse event reporting mechanisms to promote accountability for potential risk from cell-based treatments; and 3) boosts the experiences and proficiency of physicians on the technical know-how of transplantation procedures as well as help regulatory officials in gathering more experiences on proper risk assessment. Additionally, it lowers the cost of development for smaller companies to promote their development.",
        "The concerns raised in other jurisdictions were mostly about ambiguities and definitions around minimal manipulation and non-homologous use-particularly where some of the regulatory agencies drew distinctions around the definitions of these terms (PEW, 2019). For example, the United States FDA’s distinction between structural, and non-structural tissue led to the consideration of adipose-derived stem cells as drug products rather than in the 361 category as expected by cell therapy developers (PEW, 2019). Such differing definitions and the scope of minimal manipulation across jurisdictions amid the growing market of unproven stem cells in private clinics has been reported (Turner and Knoepfler, 2016). In order to improve the oversight on CBT in Taiwan, a key question and an emerging issue was whether private clinics should be approved to offer CBT within the context of the special regulation. This question is an ongoing debate; as recent reforms consider approving private clinics to offer CBT. Respondents opinions on risk management were based on the lack of proper teams and facilities to care for and follow up patients. Such a zero-risk stance is understandable in light of risky private practices that have caused harm to patients in the past (Lomax et al., 2020). In addition, the lack of scientific knowledge pertaining to CBT could influence their interactions with patients (Smith et al., 2021). These concerns corroborate a previous study which revealed that patients depend on the judgement of physicians and see them as reliable sources of information regarding CBT (Aiyegbusi et al., 2020). On the other hand, the lack of clinical evidence base is the reason why some respondents were in favor of cell therapy practice in clinics considering the need for supplementary clinical evidence on the approved autologous therapies. In line with this, the Taiwanese regulatory authorities require strict inspection of quality standards for cell processing and facilities, follow-up record system and co-operation with medical centers specifically for private clinics interested in using cell based technologies as cancer treatment.",
        "The concerns regarding the special regulation expressed by respondents include: 1) its inaptness for clinical evidence; 2) the limited approved cell treatments and indications; and 3) the time and criteria used by review committees to assess and approve applications. Similarly, the European Hospital exemption (HE) of all the regulatory strategies has been an area of concern among stakeholders due to its different interpretations, and implementations across European member states (Hourd, 2014). Thus, there are growing expectations for the regulation to be improved considering that the clinical data from HE could help Advanced Therapy Medical Products development. To address concerns about clinical evidence in Taiwan, health authorities recently announced their intent to use real-world evidence to bridge evidence gaps between cell therapy techniques and products. To this end, clinical data obtained from medical practices could be used as supporting evidence to develop medicinal products as incorporating real world evidence could reveal the efficacy of CBT treatment. A similar idea was recently proposed for Japan’s ASRM to transform the clinical practice of cell therapies into an evidence-based form (Takashima et al., 2021). Such a practice is also being considered in the 21st Century Cure Act of the United States FDA for new indications and post-market surveillance of regenerative medicine advanced therapy designated products. How this will be done has not been clearly stated by the regulatory authorities in United States or Taiwan. Thus far, Taiwan had successfully used real world evidence to inform regulatory decisions on the approval of pharmaceuticals, i.e., sapropterin tablet, oral ketoconazole, and alteplase (Chen et al., 2020). Therefore, such experience might prove useful in addition to experience sharing and learning from other jurisdictions who have considered or may be considering the use of real world evidence (Earl, 2019; Takashima et al., 2021). Moving forward, there is need for more clarification from the Taiwanese health authorities on what is expected of cell therapy developers regarding the use of real-world data.",
        "The challenges hindering medical practice highlighted by respondents were, first, autologous cells appear more pleasing owing to their minimal risk of rejection as compared with allogeneic cells. Yet, it is evident that physicians and industry experts were dissatisfied with their efficacy outcomes. This is in line with the literature considering efficacy is patient specific and largely influenced by a number of factors (McAllister et al., 2012; Hurley et al., 2018; Krause et al., 2019; Du et al., 2021). Furthermore, this dissatisfaction may be predictable considering that those approved cells were intended for life-threatening diseases such as end stage cancer. With this, we observed optimism on the part of physicians, as they seek alternatives to help their patients, and likewise companies have shown willingness to develop allogeneic cell therapies (Plagnol et al., 2009).",
        "Secondly, clinical outcome evaluation was regarded as problematic as the design of the electronic form was revealed as inapt for efficacy evaluation in addition to concerns about how to measure efficacy outcomes. Also, the reported fewer number of patients enrolled based on MoHW database could result in a wide evidence gap and the need for more clinical evidence. This is in line with a previous study that revealed limited evidence base and developmental pipeline in the regenerative field, especially in patients with rare diseases (Abou-El-Enein and Hey, 2019). The idea of clinical data collation in preparation for review was perceived akin to clinical trials and regarded as complicated compared with routine medical practice. This is in line with the study by Takashima et al. (Takashima et al., 2021) which indicated the challenges of data collection for clinicians (Takashima et al., 2021). Thus, the unwillingness of healthcare professionals could lead to a shortage of clinicians, and hence slow the pace of CBT innovation in Taiwan. Our findings suggest the need to fund and support clinicians who are invested in fulfilling the role of data collectors and other related duties.",
        "Thirdly, the large out-of-pocket costs were indicated as burdensome to patients as shown by the fewer number of enrolled patients. The implication is that only those who can afford the therapies will have access which could, in turn, lead to access inequality (Aiyegbusi et al., 2020). The contributing factors to the high-out of pocket costs include the patient-specific nature of autologous cell therapies and manufacturing standards which were considered problematic for hospitals and small companies (Gee, 2002). Although, mass production of allogeneic cells was considered cost effective, however, it is possible that the cost of manufacturing, and regulatory oversight by the TFDA refute such theoretical statement (McAllister et al., 2012). Accordingly, the government is trying to control and negotiate the prices of these therapies with both the companies and medical centers but how this negotiation will be done in the face of the GMP manufacturing standards is unknown.",
        "Finally, we observed tension between reviewers and these experts as they noted their inability to understand their expectations on regulatory demands and standards. Moreover, United States FDA officials were considered more experienced. This is not surprising considering the larger market size, hence, and broader familiarity with innovative therapies on the part of their regulators and reviewers. It turns out that the regulatory standards were perceived to be very demanding making it difficult for medical institutions and small companies to navigate the regulatory environment. Furthermore, lack of familiarity and understanding of regulatory compliance have complicated the situation as medical institutions do not have offices for regulatory affairs in addition to the limited knowledge about compliance in small companies. Currently, medical institutions in other countries are beginning to open up regulatory offices to cater to cell therapy developments. On the other hand, it is largely difficult for regulators across jurisdictions to keep up with these innovative therapies, given the field of cell therapy is evolving at a rapid pace. In light of this, the reviewer's probing nature to evaluate the risks and benefits is understandable, since there are no tools to measure the risk-benefit ratio (McAllister et al., 2012). Therefore, the challenge of how to properly review CBT in terms of safety, quality, and efficacy without stifling the development of CBT (Lysaght et al., 2018) is not an easy task to manage but not insurmountable either.",
        "Our study provides key insight into experts perceptions of the “Special Regulation for Cell Therapy” in Taiwan and challenges to the clinical development of CBT. The strength of the study lies in the differing backgrounds of respondents allowing for some degree of reflexivity and nuanced insight. All respondents are very knowledgeable in their area of expertise as is evident in their level of education and experience in cell therapy development. Respondents were interviewed based on their own point of view, independent of their workplace. Our study does not represent the perspectives of all stakeholders. Therefore, we suggest the need for future research into the perspectives of patients and regulators.",
        "This study aimed to understand Taiwan’s regulatory framework for cell therapy development. Thus, we focused on experts perspectives and specifically on the implementation of one of the regulatory frameworks known as the “Special Regulation for Cell Therapy”. It is well known that the potential breakthrough of cell-based therapies is fraught with numerous challenges. In spite of this, Taiwanese health authorities has been making tremendous efforts to approve its first regenerative medicine product(s). While the establishment of the new framework was designed to shorten lengthy developmental timelines for the commercialization of regenerative medicinal products, it also addresses safety concerns, patient access and stem cell tourism. Thus, these experts offer insight into some of the remaining challenges especially in relation to evidentiary standards which they believe slows down the pace of these developments. Therefore, to exploit the full potential of cell therapies, there is need for further improvement by the health authorities. It would be helpful for the authorities to adopt policy interventions such as provide funding, educational resources, training on quality control standards, and cost-saving strategies to address some of these unsolved issues as well as communicate with cell therapy developers in a timely manner.",

    "title": "Translational development of ABCB5(+) dermal mesenchymal stem cells for therapeutic induction of angiogenesis in non-healing diabetic foot ulcers. desirable to avoid infections, amputations and life-threatening complications, DFUs often respond poorly to standard treatment. GMP-manufactured skin-derived ABCB5(+) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) might provide a new adjunctive DFU treatment, based on their remarkable skin wound homing and engraftment potential, their ability to adaptively respond to inflammatory signals, and their wound healing-promoting efficacy in mouse wound models and human chronic venous ulcers. METHODS: The angiogenic potential of ABCB5(+) MSCs was characterized with respect to angiogenic factor expression at the mRNA and protein level, in vitro endothelial trans-differentiation and tube formation potential, and perfusion-restoring capacity in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model. Finally, the efficacy and safety of ABCB5(+) MSCs for topical adjunctive treatment of chronic, standard therapy-refractory, neuropathic plantar DFUs were assessed in an open-label single-arm clinical trial. RESULTS: Hypoxic incubation of ABCB5(+) MSCs led to posttranslational stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and upregulation of HIF-1alpha mRNA levels. HIF-1alpha pathway activation was accompanied by upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription and increase in VEGF protein secretion. Upon culture in growth factor-supplemented medium, ABCB5(+) MSCs expressed the endothelial-lineage marker CD31, and after seeding on gel matrix, ABCB5(+) MSCs demonstrated formation of capillary-like structures comparable with human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Intramuscularly injected ABCB5(+) MSCs to mice with surgically induced hindlimb ischemia accelerated perfusion recovery as measured by laser Doppler blood perfusion imaging and enhanced capillary proliferation and vascularization in the ischemic muscles. Adjunctive topical application of ABCB5(+) MSCs onto therapy-refractory DFUs elicited median wound surface area reductions from baseline of 59% (full analysis set, n = 23), 64% (per-protocol set, n = 20) and 67% (subgroup of responders, n = 17) at week 12, while no treatment-related adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present observations identify GMP-manufactured ABCB5(+) dermal MSCs as a potential, safe candidate for adjunctive therapy of otherwise incurable DFUs and justify the conduct of a larger, randomized controlled trial to validate the clinical efficacy.

        "Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are among the most common and potentially serious complications of diabetes mellitus, with an estimated 19% to 34% of diabetes patients developing a DFU during their lifetimes [1]. Around 40% of patients who have developed a DFU die within 5 years [2–4]. While a significant proportion of the mortality rates can be attributed to fatal cardio-vascular complications of diabetes [5–7], the ulcer contributes independently to mortality due to inflammatory sequelae [4, 8, 9]. Specifically, more than half of DFUs become infected [10], with roughly 20% to 50% of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections potentially leading to some grade of lower extremity amputation [1, 11–14]. Many patients who underwent a DFU-related amputation have a poor quality of life and a high risk of premature death [15].",
        "While rapid healing is highly desirable to avoid infections, amputations and life-threatening complications [16–18], DFUs often respond poorly to standard treatment. Reported healing failure rates range from roughly 40% to 80% at 12 weeks and still from 15 to 70% at 1 year of treatment (Additional file 1: Table S1). Current treatment guidelines advocate to consider adjunctive therapy options for DFUs that have not achieved a 50% area reduction within 4 weeks [19–21] or failed to heal after 4–6 weeks [22] of standard wound care. There are an increasing number of therapeutic efforts to speed the healing of DFUs, and the literature surrounding their use is evolving [23].",
        "From a pathophysiologic perspective, dysfunctional wound healing in diabetes is closely linked to insufficient angiogenesis [24], caused by a chronic inflammatory disposition in concert with impaired cellular responses to tissue hypoxia [25–27]. A sustained, interleukin (IL)-1β-driven prevalence of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages associated with defective transition to reparative, granulation-promoting M2 macrophages [28–33] and an impaired activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1α (HIF-1α) pathway by local fibroblasts and endothelial cells [34–36] leading to deficient HIF-1α-dependent upregulation of multiple angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [34–38] ultimately result in a decreased amount of nascent microvasculature [39, 40].",
        "In the light of a complex pathophysiology, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), derived from various sources, including adipose tissue, bone marrow, peripheral blood and umbilical cord, have been extensively investigated and considered a promising approach to adjunctive DFU treatment [41–43], owing to their remarkable ability to adaptively respond to signals associated with tissue injury and inflammation by providing paracrine signals which alter the wound environment toward a pro-healing state or even directly participate in wound regeneration [43, 44]. MSCs, among others particularly adipose tissue-derived MSCs or stromal vascular fraction cells, have been safely and successfully used alone or combined with dermal substitutes or autologous growth factors such as platelet-rich plasma to treat skin wounds and scars of various etiologies including diabetic and vascular ulcers, burn wounds, post-traumatic wounds [45, 46]. Owing to a wide range of immunomodulatory capacities involving direct interactions with immune cells as well as various paracrine pathways [47], they are considered attractive candidates for the treatment of local and systemic inflammatory conditions including even COVID-19 [48]. However, most of the investigated MSC therapies have not progressed beyond early-stage clinical trials [49], and translation of an MSC-based approach for the treatment of otherwise non-healing DFUs that is readily (off the shelf) available and does not require an elaborate surgical procedure into clinical practice has not yet been achieved.",
        "Recently, a skin-resident MSC population characterized by expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5) has been found severely reduced in the dermis of diabetic db/db mice. This might imply that the function of this cell population is impaired under diabetic conditions, which, as a consequence, might favor poor wound healing in diabetes [50]. Conversely, ABCB5+ MSCs were shown to respond to inflammatory milieus through multiple cell contact-dependent and paracrine mechanisms [51–53]. In a chronic wound model mimicking human chronic venous ulcers, ABCB5+ MSCs shifted the M1 macrophage prevalence toward an M2 phenotype via secretion of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) and rescued impaired angiogenesis in the wound bed [53]. These effects were associated with an acceleration of wound healing, which was also observed in human chronic venous ulcers treated with ABCB5+ MSCs [54, 55]. Very recently, angiogenesis- and healing-promoting efficacy of ABCB5+ MSCs was demonstrated also in a mouse diabetic wound model [50].",
        "Dermal ABCB5+ MSCs cells can be easily accessed from healthy human donors, expanded to a clinical scale and delivered as a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-conforming advanced-therapy medicinal product (ATMP) of proven purity, safety and tolerability [56, 57]. ABCB5+ MSCs display a spindle-like, fibroblastoid cell morphology and express the minimal set of mesenchymal lineage markers CD73, CD90 and CD105, in addition to CD29, CD44, CD49e and CD166, whereas no expression of the endothelial lineage marker CD31, the dendritic cell marker CD34, the pan-hematopoietic lineage marker CD45, the monocyte/macrophage marker CD14 and the B lymphocyte antigen CD20 was detectable by flow cytometry [51, 53]. A consistent and significantly increased potential for adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineage differentiation delineates human ABCB5+ MSCs from donor-matched ABCB5– dermal fibroblasts [53]. Aiming at developing ABCB5+ MSCs for the treatment of human DFUs, we here characterize their angiogenic potential with respect to angiogenic factor expression at the mRNA and protein level, in vitro endothelial trans-differentiation and tube formation potential, and in vivo perfusion-restoring capacity. Building upon these results in conjunction with the existing evidence on the cells’ anti-inflammatory potential we have established three potency assays in order to deliver human skin-derived ABCB5+ MSCs as an ATMP with standardized biological activity. Finally, this product was tested in a clinical trial in patients suffering from non-healing, standard treatment-refractory DFUs.",
        "Human ABCB5+ MSCs were derived from skin samples obtained from patients undergoing abdominoplasties or other surgical interventions that provide left-over skin tissue after informed written consent was obtained. Cell production was carried out in an EU-GMP grade A cabinet in a grade B clean room under laminar air flow following a validated GMP-conforming protocol as described previously [56]. In brief, after enzymatic digestion of the skin tissue, cells were centrifuged and expanded as unsegregated culture by serial passaging upon adherence selection in an in-house MSC-favoring medium (Ham’s F-10 supplemented with fetal calf serum, L-glutamine, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), HEPES, hydrocortisone, insulin, glucose, and phorbol myristate acetate). ABCB5+ cells were isolated by antibody-coupled magnetic bead sorting using a mouse anti-human ABCB5 monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular loop 3 of the ABCB5 molecule [58] (Maine Biotechnology Services, Portland, Maine; GMP purification: Bibitec, Bielefeld, Germany), cryo-preserved in CryoStor® CS10 freeze medium (BioLife Solution, Bothell, WA) containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen.",
        "ABCB5+ MSCs (3 × 105) were seeded in 750 µl MSC-favoring medium in a culture dish and placed in a hypoxia chamber, which was flushed for 5 min with nitrogen-enriched gas (1% O2, 4% CO2, 95% N2; Air Liquide, Düsseldorf, Germany) at a rate of 20–25 l/min. During cultivation for up to 48 h, the chamber was flushed again after 1 h and 24 h.",
        "ABCB5+ MSCs were centrifuged (Cytospin™; Thermo Fisher, Dreieich, Germany) onto coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution, permeabilized with 1% Triton™ X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained for HIF-1α (for antibodies see Additional file 1: Table S2). Nuclei were counterstained with 4’,6 diamidino-2 phenylindole (DAPI).",
        "Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy® Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the Applied Biosystems™ High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher) and the Applied Biosystems™ SYBR Green Mastermix (Thermo Fisher) in a four-step process run in a Mastercycler® Personal thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). PCR reactions were run in triplicate in an Applied Biosystems™ StepOne RealTime™ PCR System (Thermo Fisher). Primer sequences are provided in Additional file 1: Table S3. Actin served as housekeeping gene. Primer quality and integrity of the amplified product was confirmed by melting curve analysis. Identity of the PCR products was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Relative quantification of transcript levels was determined using the 2−ΔΔCt algorithm.",
        "VEGF concentration in the cell culture supernatant was measured using the Invitrogen VEGF Human ELISA Kit (Thermo Fisher), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Assays were run in triplicate.",
        "ABCB5+ MSCs (1 × 106) were seeded in 24-well culture plates and cultured for up to 96 h in culture medium supplemented with 200 ng/ml recombinant human (rh) VEGF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1000 ng/ml rhFGF-2 (CellGenix, Freiburg, Germany) and 1000 ng/ml rh platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB; R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). Trans-differentiation and proliferation activity were assessed by CD31 and Ki67 staining, respectively (for antibodies see Additional file 1: Table S2). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. All experiments were performed in triplicates. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; 5 × 105; Thermo Fisher) served as positive control.",
        "ABCB5+ MSCs (1 × 105/ml or 1.5 × 105/ml) and HUVECs (0.5 × 105/ml or 1 × 105/ml) were seeded on Geltrex™ (Thermo Fisher)-coated culture plates and incubated at 37 °C for 19–22 h (ABCB5+ MSCs) and 16–18 h (HUVECs). For examination of cell viability, cells were stained with calcein acetoxymethylester (Thermo Fisher; 1:10,000, 30 min, 37 °C). Tube formation and calcein fluorescence were evaluated microscopically (EVOS™ FLoid™ cell imaging station).",
        "Male OF1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Saint-Germain-Nuelles, France) were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen, and the inner faces of both hindlimbs were carefully shaved. After local disinfection, an about 1-cm skin incision was made on the left hindlimb from the inguinal region to the bifurcation region of the femoral artery into the saphenous and popliteal artery. The femoral artery and vein were dissected from the nerve. The femoral artery/vein block was ligated proximally by two 8–0 ties placed just distally from the superficial epigastric artery, and distally by two 8–0 ties placed just proximally from the bifurcation of the femoral artery into the saphenous and the popliteal artery. After cutting the femoral artery/vein block between the two proximal and between the two distal ties, the femoral artery/vein block was removed. When necessary, major branches such as the lateral circumflex femoral artery were ligated to avoid bleeding.",
        "Thereafter, subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with non-resorbable sutures or clamped with titanium micro clips (WDT, Garbsen, Germany). Postoperative care included pain management by injection of buprenorphine (Buprenovet, Bayer; 0.1 mg/kg) once directly after surgery or flunixin meglumine (2.5 mg/kg twice daily) during 3 days and daily local wound care with an antiseptic healing cream (Dermaflon, Pfizer).",
        "On the day after surgery, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane to receive intramuscular injections at the ischemic limb of human ABCB5+ MSCs suspended in Ringer’s lactate solution containing 2.5% human serum albumin and 0.4% glucose at concentrations between 1 × 106 and 1 × 108 cells/ml, as required. Cell doses, injection volumes and sites are given in the Results section.",
        "Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed on a warming platform in a supine position for imaging at the internal face of the thighs. Hindlimb blood flow was measured before and immediately after surgery (day 1) and on days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28 by real-time laser Doppler blood perfusion imaging (LDPI; PeriCam PSI, Perimed Instruments). The scanned area covered an ellipse framing internal face of the thigh. Blood perfusion was expressed as the ratio between LDPI values in the left (ischemic) and right (non-ischemic) limb.",
        "After sacrifice, the left, ischemic thigh and gastrocnemius muscles were preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution, embedded in paraffin wax, cut to 2–4 µm thickness, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and inspected by conventional light microscopy. Histopathological findings were quantified according to the scoring system for local cellular and tissue responses described by ISO 10993-6:2007 [59], evaluating the criteria polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, giant cells, myofiber degeneration, myofiber regeneration, necrosis, neovascularization, fibrosis, fatty infiltrates and mineralization. Neovascularization was semi-quantitatively quantified as 0 = none, 1 = minimal capillary proliferation, focal, 1–3 buds, 2 = groups of 4–7 capillaries with supporting fibroblastic structures, 3 = broad band, and 4 = extensive band of capillaries with supporting fibroblastic structures.",
        "After sacrifice, left, ischemic thigh muscles were preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution, which was replaced after 24–48 h with 70% ethanol. Immunohistochemical staining for CD31 was performed using rabbit anti-human/mouse CD31 (ab28364, Abcam; dilution 1:50) and dextran polymer-horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO EnVision® + , K4010, Agilent) for detection. CD31 expression was semi-quantitatively quantified as 0 = none, 1 = minimal, 2 = slight, and 3 = moderate by two independent investigators who were blinded to the treatment.",
        "One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test was used to compare LDPI ratios versus baseline and neovascularization and CD 31 expression in the cell-treated groups versus control.",
        "Adults (18–85 years) with diabetes mellitus type 2 (hemoglobin A1c < 11%) were eligible if they had a neuropathic diabetic plantar foot ulcer (Wagner grade 1 or 2, 1–50 cm2), confirmed by vibration sense testing (128-Hz Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork) without the presence of significant arterial disease (ankle-brachial index ≥ 0.7 or transcutaneous oxygen pressure > 40 mmHg or as per Doppler ultrasonography).",
        "Main exclusion criteria were acute Charcot foot, active osteomyelitis, treatment-requiring ulcer infection, adjacent or chronic skin disorders, skin malignancies, acute or untreated deep vein thrombosis, need for hemodialysis, surgical procedures within 2 months and use of active wound care agents within 2 weeks prior to treatment, and current use of systemic immunosuppressants, cytotoxics or glucocorticoids.",
        "The study was a national, multicenter (eight sites in Germany), open-label, single-arm, phase I/IIa trial comprising three periods: standard-of-care screening (≥ 6 weeks), treatment and efficacy follow-up (weeks 1–12), and safety follow-up period (until end of month 12). The trial was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and local regulations and approved by the ethical committees of all participating study sites. Patients gave written informed consent prior to trial participation.",
        "Treatment consisted of up to two topical applications of 2 × 106 allogeneic ABCB5+ MSCs (suspended in Ringer’s lactate solution containing 2.5% human serum albumin and 0.4% glucose [56]) per cm2 wound area on day 0 and at week 6. The cells were manufactured as a GMP-conforming standardized ATMP (for main product release data see Additional file 1: Table S4). Originally, only one cell application was planned. The second application was amended to the protocol only after data from a first-in-human trial on chronic venous ulcers [54] suggested that a second cell dose at 6 weeks after the first cell dose might provide additional benefit for chronic wound healing. Cell application could be preceded by an optional wound debridement at the investigator’s discretion followed by waiting until the bleeding had entirely stopped. For cell application, a suspension containing 1 × 107 ABCB5+ MSCs/ml was applied onto the wound surface, delivering 2 × 106 ABCB5+ MSCs/cm2 wound surface area. Thereafter, the cells were allowed to settle for 15–30 min, optionally fixed in place with fibrin gel (Tisseel®; Baxter, Unterschleißheim, Germany), and then the wound was covered with a waterproof film dressing (Tegaderm™; 3 M, Neuss, Germany). On the following day (≥ 12 h after cell application), the film dressing was replaced by a microbe-binding dressing (Cutimed® Sorbact® tamponade or compress; BSN, Hamburg, Germany), which was changed again 1–2 days later. Additionally, patients received standard care until week 12 including glycemic control, ulcer debridement, appropriate wound dressings (i.e., microbe-binding tamponade of cavities and exudate-absorbent foam dressing for coverage), and antibiotics if required. All patients had to use offloading devices including cast devices or individually fitted therapeutic footwear [19, 60, 61].",
        "Primary efficacy endpoint was percent wound surface area reduction at week 12 or last available post-baseline measurement. Secondary efficacy endpoints were percent and absolute wound surface area reduction at predefined visits, proportion of patients achieving complete and 30% wound closure, time to complete and to 30% wound closure, granulation, epithelialization, wound exudation, time to amputation at the target leg, pain and life quality. Safety outcome measures included adverse events (during the whole study period) and vital signs, changes in physical examination findings and time to amputation of the target leg (during efficacy follow-up).",
        "Wound surface area determination followed a multistep approach combining computerized evaluation (PictZar® planimetry software; BioVisual, Elmwood Park, NJ, USA; 98% accuracy, 94% inter-rater reliability, 98% intra-rater reliability according to a validation and reliability study [62]) of standardized photographs and depth measurements using a wound measuring probe, to account for the typical three-dimensional shape of DFU wounds, i.e., consisting of wound floor, side wall and, occasionally, not visible tunneling or undermining areas. For details of the measuring and calculation algorithm see Additional file 2: Methods S1. Formation of granulation and epithelial tissue was estimated by the investigator in % of wound area from standardized wound photographs. Wound exudation was rated by the investigator as low (dry), moderate (moist), and high (wet) according to the criteria defined by the World Union of Wound Healing Societies [63]. Pain was rated by the patient using a 0–10-point numerical rating scale with 0 = no and 10 = worst imaginable pain. Quality of life was assessed using the participant-reported Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaires.",
        "Enrolment followed a Simon optimal two-stage design with responders defined as patients presenting with at least 30% wound surface area reduction at week 12. The sample size required to achieve 80% power at 5% significance level was calculated using PASS 13 software (NCSS, East Kaysville, UT, USA) to be 37 patients. This enabled the option to terminate the trial if ≤ 6 or ≥ 14 of the first 18 treated patients were responders. As in an interim analysis 12 of 18 patients emerged as responders, recruitment was continued. However, by force of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, the trial was prematurely completed. At that time, 23 patients had been treated.",
        "Safety assessments were performed on the safety analysis set, which included all patients who received at least one cell dose. Efficacy assessments were performed on the full analysis set (FAS), which included all patients of the safety analysis set who underwent wound surface area assessments at baseline and at least one post-baseline visit, and on the per-protocol set (PP), which included all patients of the FAS who had no major protocol deviations.",
        "If not otherwise stated, normally (D'Agostino–Pearson normality test) distributed parameters are presented as mean ± standard deviation, and non-normally distributed parameters as median and interquartile range (IQR). Statistical significance of percent wound surface area changes from baseline was tested against the null hypothesis (median change = 0) using a two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test. Time to complete wound closure, time to 30% wound surface area reduction and time to amputation at the target leg were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method.",
        "Prior to hypoxic incubation, HIF-1α protein was mainly detectable in the cytoplasm. During hypoxic incubation, cytoplasmic HIF-1α fluorescence decreased while nuclear HIF-1α fluorescence increased. At 24 h of hypoxia, HIF-1α was mainly detectable in the nuclei, indicating that nuclear translocation has occurred (Fig. 1A). In contrast, on the transcriptional level, HIF-1α mRNA expression peaked after 1 h of hypoxic culture and decreased thereafter, dropping down to roughly 10% of the baseline value at 48 h (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1HIF-1α and VEGF expression by ABCB5+ MSCs during hypoxic culture.

        "The VEGF ELISA after hypoxic culture was used as a surrogate potency assay to predict the pro-angiogenic bioactivity of GMP-compliantly produced ABCB5+ MSCs for use in clinical trials. Since VEGF secretion was highest at 48 h of hypoxic culture (Fig. 1D), the 48-h time point was set as temporal endpoint for potency testing. In validation studies (not shown), a VEGF concentration in the supernatant of ≥ 46.9 pg/ml, corresponding to an optical density threshold < 3.0 in the serial standard dilution of the ELISA kit, was validated to reliably enable qualitative detection and, therefore, defined as acceptance criterion for cell batch release.

        "Since in the trial protocol no threshold values had been specified to exclude patients from study treatment based on their wound surface area changes during the screening period, a Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was performed to test whether there was an association between wound surface area reduction during the screening period and during the efficacy follow-up period. A Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of 0.007 (95% CI = − 0.429, 0.417; p = 0.97) indicated that there was no association between these two parameters (Fig. 8C).",

Of these, 10 findings (56%) represented improvements.",
        "Despite well-established strategies for DFU management, treatment is often challenging, and many patients respond only poorly to standard treatment. Experimental approaches that directly target defective pathways in the wound tissue, including blockade of IL-1β by a neutralizing antibody or IL-1RA [30, 64, 65], stabilization of HIF-1α using prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, iron chelator or protein–protein interaction inhibitors [35, 37, 66, 67] or topical supplementation of pro-angiogenic growth factors [39, 68], have accelerated wound healing in diabetic mice. However, the clinical translation of these approaches has been hampered by various hurdles including safety concerns, short half-lives and/or the requirement of specific delivery systems [67, 69, 70]. In contrast to single-drug approaches, therapeutically applied MSCs are considered, by sensing their environment for hypoxia or other stress signals and making use of multiple pathways, to respond more accurately according to the physiological needs [43, 44].",
        "Here, we demonstrate that skin-derived ABCB5+ MSCs adaptively activate the proangiogenic HIF-1 pathway in response to hypoxic conditions. Activation occurred through posttranslational stabilization of HIF-1α protein (which at normoxia is subject to rapid degradation), which resulted in cellular accumulation and translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 1A). HIF-1α pathway response to hypoxia became also evident at the transcriptional level, albeit with different kinetics: Whereas HIF-1α protein accumulation and nuclear translocation was most pronounced at 24 h, HIF-1α mRNA levels, after initial upregulation to peak levels already at 1 h, progressively decreased during sustained hypoxia, having returned to baseline levels at 5 h and dropping further thereafter (Fig. 1B). Similar kinetics of HIF-1α mRNA expression in response to hypoxia have been observed in various cell types including endothelial cells and have been ascribed to a negative feedback loop that counteracts excessive HIF-1α protein accumulation during prolonged hypoxic conditions [71]. Interestingly, in mice transplanted with subcutaneous gel grafts cellularized with MSCs and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of HIF-1α in the MSCs completely abrogated experimental vessel formation in the gel graft, while HIF-1α deletion in the EPCs had no effect on vasculogenesis [72]. Thus, even though HIF-1α pathway activation is basically a common mechanism by which a cell adapts to reduced oxygen tension, HIF-1α stabilization in MSCs was considered a crucial event in cell-based therapeutic vasculogenesis [72]. In ABCB5+ MSCs, HIF-1 pathway activation was accompanied by about fourfold upregulation of VEGF transcription (Fig. 1C), which eventually resulted in a substantial increase in VEGF protein secretion (Fig. 1D).",
        "In addition to paracrine VEGF secretion under hypoxic conditions, ABCB5+ MSCs proved capable of adopting phenotypic and functional characteristics of endothelial cells in vitro, as demonstrated by expression of CD31 when cultured in growth factor-supplemented medium (Fig. 2A) and formation of capillary-like structures similar to HUVECs when seeded on gel matrix (Fig. 3). This suggests that ABCB5+ MSCs can trans-differentiate into endothelial-lineage cells, and might imply that, beyond serving paracrine proangiogenic functions to promote vascular regeneration, ABCB5+ MSCs could even directly participate in neoangiogenesis in the injured tissue. Previously, ABCB5+ MSCs have shown superior homing and engraftment to mouse skin wounds as compared to bone marrow-derived MSCs [73]. Graft survival was demonstrated in the skin against a fully allogeneic barrier (BALB/c ABCB5+ MSCs administered to C57/BL6 mice) for at least 17 days [51]. Moreover, in an NSG mouse wound model, significant detection of human-specific CD31 DNA in the wound tissue at 13 days after topical application of human ABCB5+ MSCs has indicated that endothelial trans-differentiation of these cells can actually occur in vivo [54]. Still, whether therapeutically applied ABCB5+ MSCs indeed become integrated in the regenerating vasculature remains to be elucidated.",
        "To investigate the vascular regenerative potential of ABCB5+ MSCs in vivo, we studied the effects of intramuscular cell injection on perfusion restoration in a mouse HLI model. As required from a drug regulatory perspective [74, 75], we did not use mouse ABCB5+ MSCs but tested the ATMP made of human ABCB5+ MSCs. Importantly in this regard, a significant body of studies comparing regenerative and anti-inflammatory effects of rodent and human MSCs in immunocompetent rodent models have confirmed a comparable efficacy of allogeneic and xenogeneic MSCs [76–78]. This has been attributed to the low levels of HLA and co-stimulatory molecules expressed by MSCs and by the fact that both, allogeneic and xenogeneic MSCs, survive only for a limited time in the host, before species differences could manifest [76]. In the HLI model, ABCB5+ MSCs markedly accelerated perfusion recovery as measured by LDPI (Fig. 4B; Additional file 1: Table S5). At the microscopic level, ABCB5+ MSCs significantly increased the vascularization assessed by CD31 immunostaining (Fig. 4C; Additional file 1: Table S6) and enhanced the proliferation of capillaries in the ischemic muscles (Fig. 4D,F).",
        "Beside proangiogenic capacity based on paracrine activity and endothelial differentiation, a third principal mode of action by which MSCs perform their effects over injured tissue is through interaction with the immune system. While immune modulation has not been addressed in the present study, previous studies have demonstrated that ABCB5+ MSCs respond to inflammatory milieus through multiple cell contact-dependent and paracrine mechanisms [51–53], including dampening the IL-1β-driven inflammation in chronic wounds by adaptive IL-1RA release, thereby shifting the prevalence of M1 toward proangiogenic and repair-promoting M2 macrophages in the wound tissue [53].",
        "With respect to these three principal modes of actions we have developed and established three potency assays to guarantee biological functionality and predict clinical effectiveness of therapeutically applied ABCB5+ MSCs: (i) VEGF secretion under hypoxic conditions to evaluate the angiogenic potency, (ii) tube formation on extracellular matrix gel to evaluate the endothelial trans-differentiation capacity, and (iii) IL-1RA secretion after cocultivation with M1-polarized macrophages to evaluate the immunomodulatory potency (Additional file 1: Table S4).",
        "Based on the in vitro and preclinical observations, we investigated ABCB5+ MSCs as a potential option for adjunctive treatment of DFUs. In the patient population studied, the greatest treatment success achieved over the ≥ 6-week screening period (median 7 weeks) with standard care alone was approximately 50% wound surface area reduction in 3 of 23 patients (of whom 1 patient was even treated 118 days), while in about half of the patients the ulcer enlarged (up to 175%) (Fig. 5C). Thus, in line with current DFU treatment guidelines, which recommend to consider adjunctive therapy options for DFUs that did not achieve a 50% area reduction within 4 weeks [19–21] or failed to heal after 4–6 weeks [22] of standard treatment, these ulcers had appeared refractory to standard treatment, indicating an urgent need for an advanced wound closure strategy [19–22, 79].",
        "In this hard-to-heal population, adjunctive topical application of ABCB5+ MSCs elicited statistically significant median wound surface area reductions from baseline of 59% (FAS), 64% (PP) and 67% (subgroup of responders) after 12 weeks. Acceleration of wound healing started early, becoming statistically significant (p < 0.001) already at 2 weeks (median wound surface area reduction 31% for FAS and PP) (Fig. 7A, B), which indicates that as early as at 2 weeks about half of the patients (48% of FAS and 56% of PP) had passed the predefined threshold value of 30% wound surface area reduction that was considered to classify them as responders (Fig. 7D). At 4 weeks, the median wound surface area reduction was 44% (FAS) and 48% (PP), and 1 patient (4% of FAS and 5% of PP) presented already with full wound closure (Fig. 7A, B), which together revealed that the overall situation had clearly improved as compared to the standard-of-care screening period. Finally, at week 12, 6 of these urgent-need patients (26%, 30% and 35% of FAS, PP and responders, respectively) had reached full wound closure, and it seems reasonable to expect that this rate would increase further if the follow-up period was extended, as suggested by the observation that the median wound surface area reduction was still increasing (Fig. 7A, B).",
        "A variety of other cell-based treatment strategies have been tested in controlled clinical trials for adjunctive treatment of DFUs, including autologous and allogeneic MSCs derived from bone marrow and adipose tissue [80–82], autologous adipose tissue and adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction cells [83, 84], autologous platelet-rich plasma [83, 85–90], allogeneic platelets [91], autologous skin cells [92], skin allografts [93], and various cell-containing skin substitute products [94–99] (for a summary see Additional file 1: Table S15). The reported effects show great variations, ranging from wound surface area reductions and full wound closure ratios within 12–26 weeks that did not significantly differ from the control groups [82, 83, 85, 92] to impressive significant wound surface area reductions from baseline of up to 98% within 80 days [90] and wound closure ratios of up to 100% within 8 weeks [84]. However, in the trials that observed superiority of the investigational treatment over standard treatment, the reported outcomes in the standard treatment (control) groups ranged up to 88% wound surface area reduction [90] and 78% full wound closure ratio [88], indicating that considerable proportions of the treated wounds have not been refractory to standard treatment (Additional file 1: Table S15). In contrast, in the present trial we have focused on a standard treatment-refractory, extremely hard-to-heal population, which needs to be taken into account when comparing the outcomes in the present trial with those of other adjunctive treatment strategies.",
        "In view of the high personal and socioeconomic disease burden of DFUs it has become desirable to identify the patients who are likely to benefit from an adjunctive treatment strategy as early as possible. Basically, the phenomenon that a certain proportion of patients do not respond to the treatment, is widely known across the various MSC therapy approaches in a broad range of diseases, with non-responders potentially amounting up to 60% of the treated patients [100]. A major part of variability in clinical outcomes of MSC therapies has been ascribed to heterogenous products with insufficiently characterized therapeutic potency [49]. In contrast, in the present study, the strongly standardized quality and potency of the cell product (Additional file 1: Table S4) rules out potential differences in quality and bioactivity as a cause of variation in the treatment responses, which is supported by the comparably low non-responder rates of 26% (FAS) and 15% (PP). Importantly, there was no association between the treatment responses and the potency assay data of the applied cells (Additional file 1: Table S4), which indicates that the specified threshold acceptance values for product release are strong enough to guarantee proper biological activity. When comparing potential patient-related negative predictors for DFU healing such as greater wound surface area [101–106] and patient characteristics including older patient age [106–108], male gender [104, 109], very high [110] or very low [108] body mass index, lower ankle-brachial index [109] and lower hemoglobin A1c [111], there were no significant differences between the responders and the non-responders that seem to have contributed to failure of treatment response (Fig. 8A). Clearly, however, the etiology of impaired DFU healing is far more multifactorial, involving, e.g., previous diabetes control, comorbidities, and psycho-social factors [79]. On a cellular level, differential regulation or variations of genes involved in skin barrier function, inflammation or vascularization and blood flow have been associated with impaired DFU healing [112–115]. To further investigate what segregates responders to ABCB5+ MSC treatment from non-responders could aid identifying predictors of response which might help distinguishing already before treatment initiation the patients that will likely respond to ABCB5+ MSC therapy from those who will not.",
        "Naturally, the conclusions drawn from the present trial are limited by factors typically associated with early-phase trials, particularly a small patient number and an open, non-randomized design. Even though all ulcers had emerged refractory to standard treatment, we cannot rule out that part of the observed improvements has occurred through additional attention and care during the trial. Not least, as discussed above, wound healing can be influenced by various patient-specific factors that were not controlled for.",
        "Despite these limitations, we conclude that the present results support GMP-manufactured dermal ABCB5+ MSCs as a potential developable candidate for adjunctive therapy of standard treatment-refractory DFUs, even though in the present trial the majority of responders achieved only partial wound closure. Clearly, partial wound closure is a clinically less meaningful outcome than full wound closure; however, it is considered valid to “indicate relevant biological activity and help guide subsequent trials design” [75]. Importantly, the absence of any treatment-related adverse event during the trial confirmed good tolerability and overall safety of the cell product.",
        "The present studies demonstrate the in vitro and in vivo angiogenic potential of ABCB5+ MSCs based on both, paracrine pro-angiogenic factor secretion and trans-differentiation into endothelial-lineage cells. Together with the wound surface area reduction observed upon topical administration onto chronic DFUs, the results support GMP-manufactured ABCB5+ MSCs as a safe, viable candidate for adjunctive therapy of treatment-refractory DFUs and warrant further investigation in a larger randomized controlled trial with a dose-ranging design, an extended efficacy follow-up period and advanced outcome measures in order to validate the benefit and optimize the dose regime.",

A multidisciplinary team was assembled, and meetings were held to address the key tasks in the CAR-T cells’ management process and to create the guide, based on national and international recommendations and in expert’s opinions.",
        "The multidisciplinary team defined the following key tasks and issued recommendations to improve patient safety, treatment efficacy, and quality: patient selection and evaluation, CAR-T cell drug order to manufacturer, apheresis and material shipment, reception of CAR-T cell drug and storing, CAR-T cell drug prescription and pharmacy verification, CAR-T cell drug thawing and dispensing, CAR-T cell drug administration, patient education, pharmacovigilance and monitoring and outcomes’ record and evaluation. In each task the pharmacist’s role and how it can improve patient care are defined. A checklist was created to guarantee the compliance of standard operating procedures approved in the institution to manage CAR-T cell therapy and as a tool to collect required data for outcomes’ record and evaluation.",
        "This article provides a consensus set of safety recommendations regarding CAR-T therapy management in clinical practice, easily implementable by other institutions in the European setting. The guide identifies key steps where the involvement of hospital pharmacists would improve the safety and quality of the process and is a support guide to standardize hospital pharmacists’ responsibilities within the multidisciplinary team.",
        "Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies (CAR-T) are a type of advanced therapy based on the use of T lymphocytes to identify and kill tumor cells expressing a specific antigen. This new type of immunotherapy consists of T lymphocytes that are genetically manipulated ex vivo to express engineered CARs specific for particular tumor targets. These reprogrammed CAR-T cells are subsequently expanded, selected if necessary, and conditioned to produce the drug that the patient will eventually receive. Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah®, Novartis) and Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta®, Kite Pharma EU) were the first two CAR-T cell drugs authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Both therapies target the B-lymphocyte antigen CD19 and are approved: tisagenlecleucel for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtypes (DLBCL), and axicabtagene ciloleucel for DLBCL (1, 2).",
        "The manufacturing and use process for CAR-T cell drugs are complex and highly specialized. The two available CAR-T cell drugs use autologous T cells, which are collected in a leukapheresis process, sent to the manufacturer to be genetically modified to express the CAR and sent back to the treatment center to be reinfused into the patient, after they have received a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen (3).",
        "CAR-T cell therapy has been associated with a number of potentially severe complications, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), which require coordinated management by a diverse multidisciplinary team (hematologists, intensivists, neurologists and pharmacists) (4, 5). CRS is a systemic inflammatory response caused by cytokines released by infused CAR-T cells and can lead to widespread reversible organ dysfunction. Manifestations of CRS include fevers, nausea, headache, myalgia, tachycardia hypotension, hypoxia, and organ dysfunction, cytopenias, coagulopathy, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In most severe cases, hypotension requiring high-dose vasopressors and hypoxia requiring mechanical ventilation may occur as life-threating complications (6). Neurologic toxicities are diverse and include encephalopathy, cognitive defects, dysphasias, seizures, and cerebral edema (6). Oncology pharmacists are familiar with this type of toxicities as they are similar to those described with anti-checkpoint immunotherapies (7) or blinatumomab treatment (a bi-specific antibody that targets CD19 and can cause CRS and global encephalopathy) (6, 8).",
        "The implementation of a CAR-T cell therapy program in clinical practice requires an exhaustive preparation of the institution, to accomplish accreditation requirements and the participation of professionals with different backgrounds, in order to guarantee the safe and efficient use of these medications (9). This complex care process has similarities to the logistics of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (10).",
        "The roles and competencies of the clinical pharmacist involved in HSCT have been defined by several organizations. The American and European societies of Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT and EBMT) have published recommendations of HSCT clinical pharmacists’ activities and responsibilities (11–13). Both documents endorse pharmacist roles with medication management, patient care, transitions of care, education, and research. Unfortunately, there is little data about the pharmacist’s responsibilities to patients treated with CAR-T cell therapy. The EBMT consensus includes the pharmacist role with managing advanced therapy medicinal products, such as CAR-T cells, as they are licensed as medicines (12). The Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy–Joint Accreditation Committee ISCT EBMT (FACT–JACIE) standards on immune effector cells therapy recognizes the role of pharmacists in the clinical team and describes the training and knowledge required (14). Some other publications have addressed the roles and responsibilities of hospital pharmacist with CAR-T cell therapy (15, 16). However, as far as we know, there are not many published experiences of groups that have put these recommendations into practice in a CAR-T cell therapy program.",
        "Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop a structured and practical guide that supports hospital pharmacist responsibilities and defines specific activities in a CAR-T cell therapy program, based on national and international recommendations and in expert’s opinions.",
        "This guide, supporting pharmaceutical responsibilities in the management and safety of CAR-T cell therapy, was designed using the nominal group technique (with direct communications between experts and face-to-face discussion). A multidisciplinary team was assembled with hematologists (HSCT and cell therapy specialists) and clinical pharmacists from different backgrounds: clinical oncohematology, traceability and patient safety, and investigational drugs.",
        "The professionals involved are recognized experts in CAR-T cell therapy and belong to the institution’s multidisciplinary Advanced Therapies Unit, which was one of the first accredited in Spain for the treatment of patients with CAR-T cell drugs. The center is JACIE-accredited (17) (Joint Accreditation Committee—European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)) and has treated 35 patients with CAR-T cell drugs between 2019 and 2020.",
        "We performed a review of the literature in order to identify the guidelines and recommendations related to pharmacy practice in CAR-T cell therapy programs. A computerized search was carried out on MEDLINE, through PubMed, using the medical subject heading (MeSH) ‘Immunotherapy, Adoptive’ and the terms ‘Pharmacy’, ‘Pharmacist’, ‘Pharmaceutical care’, ‘Pharmacy Service, Hospital’, ‘Guidelines’, ‘Professional Role’, ‘Safety’, ‘Continuity of Patient Care’. Pharmacists conducted the literature search and extraction of relevant titles among articles published in the last 10 years in English, Spanish, or French. References of reviewed articles were also searched for relevant titles. Recommendations by international and national well-known hematology and pharmacy societies were also included: Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT) (14, 18), American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) (11), European Society of Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) (12), European Hematology Association (EHA) (10), Specialist Pharmacy Service of the United Kingdom National Health System (19), and Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy (SEFH) (20). Finally, the research was complemented with the summary of product characteristics of the CAR-T cell drugs approved: tisagenlecleucel (1) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (2).",
        "The Spanish Ministry of Health published the “Boarding plan of advanced therapies in the National Health System (NHS): CAR therapies” (21), which establishes the organizational and care model that aims to guarantee a planned, equitable, safe and efficient use of CAR-T cell drugs within the NHS. These organizational standards were also considered to develop the guide.",
        "To define the variables recorded for outcomes’ evaluation the team considered the “Pharmacoclinical protocol of tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel use in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the National Health System” (22) and the “Pharmacoclinical protocol of tisagenlecleucel use in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the National Health System” (23). Those protocols are defined by a national Experts Commission on the use of CAR-T cell drugs. This Commission reviews approved indications for CAR-T cell therapy in general and authorize each particular case to be treated.",
        "With the information gathered, the pharmacists elaborated the guide considering the key tasks in the CAR-T cells management process. In subsequent meetings, the pharmacists presented the guide and a debate allowed the experts to contrast opinions and reach a consensus on the responsibilities and tasks, considering complexity and challenges of safe CAR-T cells use process. Knowledge in clinical practice of health professionals were taken into consideration. After a review process at the institution, this final guidance on hospital pharmacy tasks and responsibilities within the CAR-T cell therapy program was adopted.",
        "The multidisciplinary team defined the following key tasks during CAR-T cell drugs use process: patient selection and evaluation, CAR-T order to manufacturer, collection and shipment of leukapheresis product, reception of CAR-T and storing, CAR-T prescription and pharmacy verification of orders, CAR-T thawing and dispensing, CAR-T administration, patient information and education, pharmacovigilance and monitoring, and outcomes record and evaluation (Figure 1). Therefore, the guide was structured according to the previously mentioned items. Along with the guide, the team created a checklist that helped with compliance along the processes and as a tool to collect required data to ensure traceability, efficacy and safety (Table 1).",
        "Key tasks during CAR-T cell therapy use process defined by the multidisciplinary team. Numbers represent the guide key points defined in subheading 3 in the text: 1-Patient evaluation and selection and CAR-T cell drug order; 2-Apheresis and material shipment; 3-Reception of CAR-T cell drug and storing; 4-CAR-T cell drug prescription and pharmacy verification of orders; 5-CAR-T cell drug thawing and dispensing; 6-CAR-T cell drug administration; 7-Patient information and education; 8-Pharmacovigilance and monitoring; 9-Outcomes’ record and evaluation.",
        "Guide supporting pharmaceutical responsibilities in the management and safety of CAR-T cell drugs.",
        "SEC, Single European Code, DIN, Donation Identification Number, eMAR, electronic medication administration record.",
        "From the literature search, the multidisciplinary team selected the most pertinent data to improve patient safety, and treatment efficacy and quality. The team issued the following final recommendations regarding the key tasks:",
        "The hospital CAR-T Multidisciplinary Committee, integrated by hematologists, oncologists, critical care specialists, immunologists, neurologists, radiologists, hospital pharmacists and nursing staff (21), evaluates candidate patients for CAR-T cell therapy. After patient acceptance, this board coordinates their clinical management in a comprehensive way, before, during and after CAR-T cell therapy (5). As part of this committee, hospital pharmacists check that CAR-T cell drugs are going to be used for an approved indication (10) and according to the therapeutic protocol that defines its use in the NHS (22, 23). They also verify that approval from the Expert Commission on the use of CAR-T cell therapy is in place (15). Moreover, pharmacists may perform medication reconciliation before CAR-T treatment checking patient’s medication list for drug–drug interactions (e.g. corticosteroids).",
        "In the European setting, pharmacists have extensive experience in drug acquisition and managing and monitoring the drugs budget. The pharmacy department is in charge of formalizing the purchase order of the advanced therapy medicinal products, as well as billing supervising of these therapies. This responsibility is stated in European legislation (Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on advanced therapy medicinal products) (24), that subjects these products to the same principles as other medicines. Pharmaceutical industries have developed platforms for the ordering and management of CAR-T cell therapies. These platforms have been adapted to meet with these criteria, requiring the approval of a hospital pharmacist before the purchasing actually takes place.",
        "Patient identification numbers from hospital and manufacturer are important to be recorded and tracked over the therapy process, and they should be linked to the corresponding product identifiers: manufacturer and pharmacy order numbers. These identifiers are basic to establish a “chain of custody” or “chain of identity” to ensure that every patient receives the correct medicine and that it has been handled properly (25, 26).",
        "An apheresis order set was included in the computerized prescription order entry (CPOE) system with two purposes. First, it allows documenting the date of cells’ collection, the manufacturer’s identifiers as well as the Donation Identification Number (DIN), which is an international and unique identifier for a certain collection process. Second, it enables clinical pharmacists to verify that washout periods are fulfilled, as is the case for granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), cytotoxics, and steroids (27). From our perspective, the inclusion of the apheresis order in the same system where the CAR-T cell drug prescription and administration are recorded enhances the safety and traceability of the process.",
        "Moreover, during the leukapheresis process, a pharmacist and a hematologist double check the information on the apheresis bag: patient name, medical record number, date of birth, DIN number, and manufacturer’s identifier.",
        "Pharmacists take care of the reception and storage of CAR-T cell drugs, as well as other hospital medications (10, 16). Given that in our institution, the storage is carried out in the Cell Therapy Unit of the Hematology Department, an agreement between the pharmacy and this unit is established to coordinate the reception of the CAR-T cell drug. Manufacturer’s platforms send emails to the reception team, so date and time are arranged in advance.",
        "Pharmacists and hematologists will double check at this step (19): packaging integrity, temperature compliance during transit, integrity of the infusion bag(s), identification and labeling (patient name, medical record number, date of birth, DIN number, manufacturer’s identifier and lot number), number of bags received and expiration date. It is critical that the chain of identity is verified once again at this point (5), so we performed a double-check between the data in the label on the bag and the identifiers we previously recorded.",
        "After reception, pharmacists confirm that the storing conditions are adequate. A continuous temperature monitoring system with 24-h working alarm is in place. Finally, pharmacists document the reception on manufacturer’s platform and file the documentation received, certificate of analysis and delivery note on the Pharmacy Department.",
        "As part of FACT accreditation, preprinted or electronic orders must be developed for preparative chemotherapy regimens and cell therapy infusion, and must be recorded in chemotherapy administration records (28).",
        "Different lymphodepleting therapy order sets were included in the CPOE system. These order sets are specific for each CAR-T cell drug and diagnostic, and simplify prescription for hematologists. Once the lymphodepleting therapy is prescribed, clinical pharmacists verify the order, focusing on: patient’s identity, expected date of the CAR-T infusion, drug regimen and doses according to the CAR-T cell drug and diagnosis, and supportive drugs (pre-medication, anti-infective prophylaxis). It is our policy not to initiate the lymphodepleting therapy until the CAR-T cell drug of the patient has been received in the hospital and its integrity has been confirmed. Ready to use drugs are compounded in the Pharmacy aseptic service and dispensed to the ward correctly identified to be administered to the patient.",
        "Regarding CAR-T prescription, order sets are developed that include pre-medications like acetaminophen and diphenhydramine to avoid infusion reactions. Before CAR-T preparation and dispensing, pharmacists verify patient identity, lymphodepleting therapy interval and supportive medication. They also verify medication restrictions and washout drug periods prior to CAR-T cell drug infusion (29). Pharmacists record manufacturer’s identifier and DIN number on prescription, in order to guarantee correct traceability.",
        "Pharmacy Service guarantees that a minimum of two doses of tocilizumab are available for each patient receiving CAR-T cell therapy 24/7 (see Pharmacovigilance and monitoring for details).",
        "As mentioned, additional order sets were developed for support medications including IV fluids, anti-infective prophylaxis, seizure prophylaxis and anti-emetics. Also, specific order sets were developed for the management of the adverse events such as ICANS and CRS [tocilizumab, siltuximab-unlicensed-, anakinra-unlicensed (30)]. The electronic prescription of every drug needed for the patient allows treatment follow-up by any member of the team in charge of the patient.",
        "Thawing and final packing before administration are under the responsibility of a pharmacist (10). In our case, the Hematology and Pharmacy Departments are coordinated for CAR-T cells’ retrieval from the liquid nitrogen tank, transportation on vapor phase dewar to clinical area and defrost procedures (10).",
        "Dispensing procedure requires a double check of the correct drug by a pharmacist and a hematologist when the CAR-T cell drug is retrieved from the storage. The following items must be verified: temperature conditions during storage, patient identity (patient name, medical record number, date of birth), manufacturer’s identifier, lot number, and expiration date. This step is critical to maintain the chain of custody and identity of the CAR-T cell drug. Pharmacists check and record times of each step (removal from storage, reception on ward, start and end of thaw process) to ensure CAR-T cells’ stability from storage to administration to the patient.",
        "Due to the limited stability of CAR-T cells once thawed, in our institution this process is performed in a dedicated area within the HSCT unit. Thawing is done by trained stem cell lab staff, while a pharmacist supervises the procedure checking water bath preparation, temperature, and sterile conditions to prevent medication contamination. This step ends with the attachment of a label to the bag which contains patient’s identification, the DIN code, the manufacturer’s identifier, and a barcode which will be used at bedside by the administering nurse.",
        "The dispensing process is registered by pharmacists in the patient’s electronic medical record to facilitate communication among providers. This documentation is made according to a structured model previously established and includes: drug’s name, DIN number, manufacturer’s identifier, expiration date, infusion date, and number of bags administered.",
        "As part of FACT accreditation, CAR-T cells’ infusion must be recorded in chemotherapy administration records (28). Administration procedure of the CAR-T cell drug is defined by the multidisciplinary team, and instructions are implemented in the drug label by pharmacists: administration equipment needed, intravenous infusion, infusion rate and perfusion duration, purge and wash technique. Drug labels have a unique barcode which identifies the “five rights” of medication use: the patient, the drug, the time, the dose, and the route (31). Nurses verify the administration in the electronic medication administration record (eMAR) system. In this software, a double check is carried out by reading the barcode of the patient’s identification bracelet and the medication’s label barcode, which includes the administration number. The eMAR allows nurses to record the start and end time of the infusion and any incident that occurs during it.",
        "Once the administration of the CAR-T cell drug has taken place, the pharmacist will tag the patient with “CAR-T CELL THERAPY” in the medical record software. This will allow locating hospitalized patients or admitted to the emergency department who have been treated with CAR-T cells, which will facilitate transitions of care along the hospital and later pharmacovigilance.",
        "Patients and their families should be given, before being discharged from hospital, appropriate education about early signs and symptoms of CRS and ICANS and their severity to avoid a delay in seeking medical attention (5). Most importantly, patients treated with CAR-T cells should be instructed to immediately alert all providers that they have received this therapy, especially if presenting to a facility outside of their original treatment center (32).",
        "Patients are given an information card for the specific CAR-T cell drug administered, to carry with themselves and present to all healthcare professionals if needed (emergency department, medical visits, pharmacy, etc). This card includes:",
        "- Information for the patient: signs and symptoms to go to the emergency department or visit the doctor within the first 8 weeks. For example, temperature monitoring education. Contraindication to driving in the first 8 weeks after CAR-T cell drug administration.",
        "- Information for healthcare professionals: CAR-T cell drug administration date. Contact details of the responsible hematologist, telephone number in case of emergency and contact details of the hospital pharmacist.",
        "- Notice about the precaution of prescribing corticosteroids and contraindication of live vaccines.",
        "The pharmacist is in charge of medication reconciliation at patient discharge. It includes providing medication education to the patient to ensure proper understanding of administration instructions, potential interactions, and adverse effects, as well as we confirmed that patients have been able to get the medicines from their community pharmacy.",
        "Health professionals involved in the management of patients treated with CAR-T cells have been trained in the management of the main adverse reactions, in compliance with the FDA-mandated training as part of a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) (33, 34). Clinical pharmacists are responsible to ensure that appropriate treatment modalities (e.g. tocilizumab) are promptly available for the management of adverse events (10, 19).",
        "As indicated by the FDA (33, 34), the inpatient pharmacy will need to stock at least two doses of tocilizumab for each patient before CAR-T cell administration and ordering protocols and order sets will need to be developed to assure timely administration of both anti-IL-6 therapy as well as corticosteroids and supportive medications as needed for CRS (28). Siltuximab and anakinra are two drugs considered for CRS treatment as second-line, when tocilizumab is not sufficiently effective (30). Both medicines are unlicensed for this indication, so their use has been protocolized in the CRS treatment protocol in our institution.",
        "All the drugs needed for patients treated with CAR-T cells are prescribed in CPOE system by the attending physician and verified by the pharmacist, including medicines for chronic conditions, supportive therapies and drugs for complications or adverse events. Pharmacists create standardized protocols in CPOE for the prescription of tocilizumab, siltuximab, or anakinra with the recommended doses and administration instructions, which will prevent delays in treating adverse events.",
        "The Pharmacy Department compounds tocilizumab and siltuximab for intravenous administration 24 h/7 days a week. To ensure maintenance of adequate stock, tocilizumab, siltuximab, and anakinra vials for CAR-T program are separated from the general store in the pharmacy. Tocilizumab kits have been developed and include four tocilizumab vials of 200 mg, instructions for nurses for its preparation and administration and a withdrawal record sheet. A tocilizumab kit is dispensed to the Marrow Transplant Unit when CAR-T cells’ administration is confirmed, as required by the summary of product characteristics (1, 2). This kit is returned to the pharmacy when the patient is discharged. Clear workflows are developed and coordinated with hematologists and nursing staff for ordering tocilizumab, siltuximab, and anakinra, either during pharmacy working hours or overnight.",
        "Long-term clinical monitoring is important for detection of some complications, such as hypogammaglobulinemia or prolonged cytopenias. Furthermore, the use of a replication­competent viral vector during CAR-T cell manufacturing could pose a theoretical risk to patients of the appearance of secondary malignancies or genotoxicity (35). However, there are currently no studies with a follow-up period long enough to fully characterize this kind of risks. For this reason, a 15 years follow-up period is mandated by the FDA for all such gene therapies (36). In our institution, pharmacists are responsible in the multidisciplinary team to define and coordinate a comprehensive pharmacovigilance CAR-T cell therapy program centralizing the evaluation and reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions to the Spanish Pharmacovigilance System. Long-term toxicity, as well as the risk of genotoxicity or the development of immunogenicity will be evaluated in subsequent Hematology visits and identified by pharmacists by consulting the electronic medical record.",
        "Incorporation of clinical decision support rules might be also beneficial in advancing patient safety and outcomes (37). Due to the known lympholytic effect of corticosteroids, they must be avoided until 3 months after administration, unless no reasonable alternatives exist (29, 38). Exceptions are the use of corticosteroids for the management of CAR-T adverse reactions or life-threatening emergencies (1, 2). Myeloid growth factors, particularly granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), have the potential to worsen CRS symptoms and are not recommended during the first 3 weeks after tisagenlecleucel infusion or until CRS has resolved (1, 29). Safety alerts have been included in the clinical decision support system integrated into the CPOE system, such as warnings when corticosteroids or granulocyte colony stimulating factors prescription. The tag “PHARMACY –Chimeric antigen receptor” in the patient’s medical record generates an alert, visible to all health professionals, when the patient arrives at the emergency department or is admitted to hospital. It can avoid prescribing corticosteroids in the emergency department if the patient has been admitted for another reason, or recommend a double verification prior to its use.",
        "The registration and analysis of data regarding CAR-T cell therapy, like clinical outcomes, acute complications and long-term toxicities will allow definition of the patients who will benefit the most from these therapies and improve future care. FACT recommends collecting internal data regarding CAR-T cell therapy and submitting them to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database for collective analyses (14). In Europe, the EMA requires that all consecutive cases of CAR-T cell therapy be reported to the EBMT registry. Safety and efficacy data should be reported to perform post-authorization studies. In Spain, the “Boarding plan of advanced therapies in the National Health System: CAR therapies” (21) also establishes another information system to report CAR-T cell outcomes in clinical practice (VALTERMED) (39), with the aim of determining the added therapeutic value of CAR-T cell therapies.",
        "Although this task is not a pharmacists’ exclusive responsibility, they can collaborate given their extensive experience in clinical informatics and data analysis (40). The CPOE system serves in our model as a repository of therapeutic and traceability data (previous and future therapeutic lines, medicines for chronic conditions, supportive therapies and drugs for complications or adverse events) that can be exploited to describe efficacy and safety of the treatment. The Pharmacy Department designed a checklist to systematically summarize the main outcomes, so it serves as a guide when completing the required databases (Figure 2).",
        "Recorded variables for outcomes’ evaluation.",
        "CAR-T cells are a new treatment paradigm for malignancies with unmet clinical needs, like B-cell ALL and DLBCL, as they offer a potentially curative option. However, CAR-T cell therapy also requires a complex patient-specific manufacturing and use process and is associated with unique toxicities which need to be recognized and managed. Considered as advanced therapy medicinal products by drug regulatory agencies, hospital pharmacists must be involved in their management to assure an effective and safe use of these medicines.",
        "This article provides a management and safety practice guide for CAR-T cell drug use process and defines the legal responsibilities and the specific activities of pharmacists throughout the process. Since many of these responsibilities are shared with hematologists, the guide was created from a multidisciplinary perspective, in the context of an institutional CAR-T cell therapy program.",
        "Despite the consensus and recommendations issued by professional associations which recognize the role of hospital pharmacists in CAR-T cell therapy programs (12, 16, 20), there is a lack of specific information about how this can be effectively implemented in a daily basis. In a survey that detailed the administrative, logistic, and toxicity management practices on CAR-T cell therapy in the United States, pharmacists were involved in multidisciplinary committees (72% of the respondents), reimbursement process, patient education, and tocilizumab stock management, but only 20% of the respondents have a dedicated CAR-T cell pharmacist (41). This work summarizes the attempt at our institution to identify key steps where the involvement of hospital pharmacists would improve the overall safety of the process. The guide was created by summarizing the most important available evidence found in the literature and has been added to the clinical pharmacist daily practice within the CAR-T cell therapy program.",
        "In particular, this guide is a tool to guarantee the compliance of standard operating procedures approved in the institution to manage CAR-T cell therapy. The guide facilitates the maintenance of the chain of custody and identity of the CAR-T cell drugs and simplifies the checking of all the aspects that guarantee the safety and secure handling of the medicine. Although platforms developed by the pharmaceutical industries are useful tools for tracking the process of shipping and delivery, we strongly recommend that hospitals develop their own records to guarantee traceability throughout the process. The forthcoming approvals of different CAR-T cell drugs from different manufacturers, each one with its own platform, will make difficult to keep traceability in daily practice.",
        "From our point of view, in order to achieve effective implementation of the guide, the coordination of health professionals involved in the CAR-T cell therapy program (hematologists, pharmacists, nurses, and other professionals) is essential, from patient selection to outcome record and evaluation.",
        "As far as we know, there are few published experiences of groups that have implemented pharmacists’ responsibilities in a CAR-T cell therapy program. The Specialist Pharmacy Service of the United Kingdom National Health Service has published a guideline to outline the key areas where chief pharmacists should focus prior to implement CAR-T cell therapy (19). It includes checklists to document key steps, but they comprise a lot of local details and are very extensive, which may be difficult to adopt by other institutions. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has published its process for implementing a commercial CAR-T cell therapy program (28). The authors identified eight essential tasks that define the CAR-T cell workflow and describe clinical, administrative, and regulatory challenges for successful implementation of this program. In this experience, pharmacists are required during infusion and early post-infusion care, to develop order sets for collection and thaw/infusion products, to track and register cell products and to guarantee the availability of tocilizumab. Our guide incorporates all those activities but also includes practical details which may serve as guidance to other institutions to implement pharmacists’ roles and responsibilities.",
        "Pharmacists have a key role as an interdisciplinary team member in CAR-T cell therapy program and their involvement can improve patients’ outcomes, given previous experiences with cancer patients (42–44). Pharmacists are in charge of chemotherapy regimen verification (bridge, lymphodepleting therapy), dose adjustments based on renal and/or hepatic function and review all medications for drug–drug and drug–food interactions. Moreover, they provide comprehensive patient and caregiver education and assess for medication adherence and reconciliation. Pharmacist may find difficulties given some gaps in pharmacy didactic curriculum and experiential education in advanced therapy medicinal products, so this guide may help to implement specific activities throughout the process.",
        "Finally, given the differences in pharmacists’ roles worldwide, this guide is more applicable to the European setting. In Europe, Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 subjects Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) to the same principles as other medicines. As these therapies are used in the hospital setting, the hospital pharmacist has the responsibility of contributing to the rational use of CAR-T cell drugs, guaranteeing and assuming the technical responsibility of their selection, ordering, product receipt, storage and preparation, and dispensing (15, 45). Otherwise, some of the processes will not be applicable to centers in United States.",
        "In this scenario, this guide is a practical and comprehensive version of the international recommendations that considers pharmacists’ responsibilities regarding the management and safety of CAR-T cell drugs. Systematic processes with a multidisciplinary approach are useful in health systems. The tool is easy to use and its implementation requires little time from health professionals and minimal technological investment.",
        "This article provides a consensus set of safety recommendations regarding CAR-T cell therapy management in clinical practice and a practical support guide to standardize hospital pharmacists’ responsibilities within the multidisciplinary team, mainly in the European setting. The proposed guide may help with the compliance of standard operating procedures and to keep traceability throughout the CAR-T cell drug use process in order to guarantee the safe and efficient use of these medications.",

Following gene introduction into T cells and stringent selection, we retrieved a highly specific TCR directed against the epitope FLYTYIAKV that did not recognize noncognate epitopes from alternative source proteins. Notably, this TCR-mediated killing of three-dimensional (3D) tumoroids in vitro and tumor cells in vivo and outperformed standard-of-care drugs. Finally, the T-cell product expressing this TCR and manufactured using a clinical protocol fulfilled standard safety and efficacy assays. Collectively, we have identified and preclinically validated ROPN1 as a target and anti-ROPN1 TCR T cells as a treatment for the vast majority of patients with TNBC. Significance: Metastatic TNBC has a dismal prognosis. This study discovers Ropporin-1 as a target for T-cell therapy for most patients. The selected TCR is highly specific and sensitive in advanced models, and preclinical testing shows that the T-cell product expressing this TCR, manufactured according to good manufacturing practice, has favorable safety and potency.

        "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer (BC) that affects relatively young women at an age of 40 to 50 years at diagnosis and accounts for 15% to 20% of all breast cancer cases. The 5-year overall survival rate for metastatic TNBC is only 12% (American Cancer Society: http://www.cancer.org/), which reflects the lack of effective treatment options. Indeed, TNBC lacks targets for hormonal therapy and HER2 amplification, and patients with TNBC are therefore not eligible for standard therapies for breast cancer (1). The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors olaparib and talazoparib have shown effectiveness in treating advanced TNBC with germline BRCA mutations [overall response rate (ORR) 55%–62%; refs. 2, 3], yet only 10% to 20% of patients with TNBC carry these mutations (4–6), and the relatively high ORR does not translate into overall survival benefit (7). The programmed cell death 1 (PD1) inhibitor pembrolizumab, when combined with chemotherapy, improves responses for a subgroup of patients with metastatic TNBC, whose tumors are positive for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), resulting in an ORR of 53% compared with 41% for chemotherapy only, but this subgroup only accounts for 30% to 40% of all patients with TNBC (8). A more recently approved standard-of-care option for patients with patients with TNBC is the trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-targeting antibody–drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan, which has resulted in an ORR of 35% and showed a gain in ORR of 30% when compared with chemotherapy in a cohort of relapsed patients with TNBC. Treatment with sacituzumab govitecan, however, is accompanied with serious side effects, with more than 50% of patients experiencing adverse events of grade 3 or higher, such as neutropenia and leukopenia (9, 10). Despite new drugs having become available, there is still an unmet demand for effective and safe therapies for patients with TNBC.",
        "A promising new treatment option for TNBC is adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT). ACT is a form of immune therapy that relies on the transfer of tumor-specific T cells that are generally generated by inserting a gene to express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or T-cell receptor (TCR) into the patients’ T cells ex vivo. CAR T cells constitute major breakthroughs for the treatment for different B-cell malignancies (11–15) as well as multiple myeloma (16–18) with six of these CAR T-cell products now implemented as standard-of-care (19). Unfortunately, the efficacy of CAR T cells to treat solid tumors lags behind significantly to that of hematologic tumors (20–25). Explanations may include that, in general, solid tumors lack tumor-specific targets available on the surface of solid tumors and harbor an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (26).",
        "TCRs recognize targets through presentation via MHC molecules, not being restricted to cell surface antigens and broadening the spectrum of potential tumor target antigens. Notably, TCR-engineered T cells targeting intracellularly the cancer germline antigens New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO1) or MAGE family member A4 (MAGE-A4) in the context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA-)A2 have shown clear clinical responses with ORRs up to 61% in patient with melanoma and synovial sarcoma. These two TCR T-cell products have a good safety profile, in which the latter has recently been granted accelerated FDA approval (27–29). However, high expression of NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A4 is limited to the abovementioned solid tumor types, and expressions are often heterogeneous and variable among patients (30).",
        "In the current study, we have identified and tested new target antigens and corresponding TCRs in a stepwise manner and according to stringent selection criteria for safety and efficacy to enable the development of ACT for TNBC. In our search, only targets were included that were absent in healthy tissues to reduce the risk of on-target toxicity. At the same time, target selection included high and homogenous expression in TNBC to facilitate effective antitumor T-cell responsiveness (31). TCRs were retrieved from naïve repertoires and selected when harboring a stringent epitope recognition motif to reduce the risk of off-target toxicity (32–34) and driving eradication of TNBC in advanced tumor models. Overall, our work reports the discovery of a novel target, the cancer germline antigen (CGA) Ropporin-1 (ROPN1), as well as the retrieval and extensive preclinical validation of an anti-ROPN1 TCR for the treatment of the majority of patients with TNBC.",
        "To discover a target suitable for ACT for TNBC, we have applied a stepwise and stringent selection process in which large gene expression datasets of normal healthy and tumor tissues were screened for intracellular antigens (Fig. 1A).",
        "ROPN1/B is absent in healthy tissues and highly and homogenously present in primary and metastatic TNBC independent of pretreatment. A, Flowchart of the discovery of ROPN1/B as a target for T-cell treatment of TNBC and validation of its tumor-restricted expression using healthy tissues, as well as primary and metastatic TNBC tissues. Intracellular targets (CGAs: n = 276) were screened for absent expression in healthy tissues (n = 1,479 tissues) and expression in TNBC (n = 191 tissues). ROPN1/B mRNA and protein expression was further validated in multiple sets of healthy tissues (two additional cohorts) and four different cohorts of patient tumor tissues (see “Methods” for details). B, Dot plot shows gene expressions as fold changes relative to GAPDH (2−dCt) according to RT-qPCR using a cDNA library of 48 healthy tissue samples. NY-ESO1 was used as a reference. Green, ROPN1; purple, ROPN1B; gray, NY-ESO1 (CTAG1B), n = 2 to 3 per target antigen. C, Representative immune stainings of ROPN1/B using an array of 14 healthy tissues (2–6 donors per tissue, total n = 66). D, Violin plots show the distribution of gene expression of NY-ESO1 (CTAG1B, gray) and ROPN1 (green) in TNBC cohort 1 (n = 66, geTMM normalized) and cohort 2 (n = 183, fRMA-normalized; see “Methods” for details on cohorts). Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test: cohort 1: P < 2.2E16; cohort 2: P < 2.2E16. E, Representative immune stainings of TNBC categorized according to staining intensity with different intensities for NY-ESO1 (top) and ROPN1/B (bottom). Stacked bar graphs (middle) show the fraction of TNBC tumors with weak, moderate, and strong immune staining of NY-ESO1 or ROPN1/B [tissue microarrays (TMA), n = 311]. Stacked bar graphs (right) show fractions of TNBC tumors with either 1% to 9%, 10% to 25%, 26% to 50%, or 51% to 100% of tumors cells positive for NY-ESO1 or ROPN1/B protein; the latter category of 51% to 100% ROPN1-stained cells is further subdivided into the fractions: 51% to 75%, 76% to 90%, and 91% to 100% (in zoomed-in stacked bar). F, Violin plot shows the distribution of gene expressions of ROPN1/B in primary and metastatic TNBC from TNBC cohort 1 (n = 66, geTMM normalized) and cohort 3 (n = 22) following batch correction. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test: P = 0.61. G, Stacked bar graphs (left) show the fraction of primary and metastatic TNBC with weak, moderate, and strong immune staining of ROPN1/B (whole tissue sections, n = 15 paired samples). Stacked bar graphs (right) show the fraction of primary and metastatic TNBC with either 1% to 9%, 10% to 25%, 26% to 50%, or 51% to 100% of tumor cells positive for ROPN1/B. H, Violin plots show the distribution of gene expression of ROPN1/B in pre- and post-induction treatment biopsies of metastatic TNBC retrieved from cohort 4 (n = 53 of which n = 44 are paired samples, geTMM normalized). Data of paired pre/postsamples was analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test: cisplatin: n = 8, P = 0.4; cyclophosphamide: n = 10, P = 1; doxorubicin: n = 9, P = 0.4; irradiation: n = 7, P = 0.7; no induction: n = 10, P = 0.73. ACT: L. intestine, Large intestine; S. intestine, small intestine.",
        "In a first step, we observed that ROPN1 as well as its paralog ROPN1B (>95% amino acid sequence homology) was one of 78 intracellular proteins that was absent in large series of healthy organs according to multiple gene expression databases (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Gene and protein expression of ROPN1 in healthy tissues was confirmed to be limited to the testis and, to a lesser extent, the epididymis (Fig. 1B and C). It is noteworthy that both these tissues are immune privileged (35, 36), meaning these tissues lack MHC molecules and are generally ignored by T cells.",
        "In a second step, the screening of tumor samples revealed that ROPN1 was expressed in more than 90% of patients with TNBC. In comparison, targets for ACT with clinical precedent, such as NY-ESO1 and MAGE-A4, were only expressed in 16% and 25% of patients with TNBC, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Furthermore, the levels of gene and protein expression were significantly higher for ROPN1 (Fig. 1D and E; Supplementary Fig. S1B) when compared with abovementioned reference targets. ROPN1 protein was detected in more than 50% of tumor cells in approximately 75% of primary TNBC (Fig. 1E). In fact, when zooming into ROPN1 expression in more than 90% of tumor cells, we observed this to be the case for approximately 60% of primary TNBC (Fig. 1E; right). These levels of abundance, extent of expression, and homogeneity are, to our knowledge, unique when compared with other targets of ACT. To assess the robustness of ROPN1 as a target for ACT, we also investigated gene and protein expressions in metastatic TNBC lesions (Fig. 1F and G) and observed that the majority of studied lymph node lesions expressed ROPN1 in more than 50% of tumor cells, highly concordant with the extent of expression observed in primary tumors. In addition, ROPN1 expression in distant TNBC lesions was not affected by preoperative treatments, such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, or radiation (Fig. 1H). Notably, ROPN1 was also expressed in 90% of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM; Supplementary Fig. S1C), implying that these patient cohorts could also benefit from ACT targeting ROPN1.",
        "TCRs recognize small peptide fragments of the target antigen in the context of HLA molecules on the surface of cells. We set out to investigate which peptides originating from the ROPN1/B protein were recognized by TCRs, not shared with other source proteins, and restricted to the HLA-A2 subtype, the latter covering 30% to 50% of the EU and US population (37). For details on peptide selection, see Supplementary Table S1 and “Methods”. ROPN1/B proteins contain 212 amino acids and cover more than 200 theoretical HLA-A2-restricted peptides according to the prediction algorithm NetMHCpan 4.1. All these peptides were then filtered for in silico qualities that are considered relevant to antigen processing and presentation, such as location of protease cleavage sites and affinities for the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and binding to HLA-A2, which shortlisted the number of peptides to 20 (Fig. 2A). This list of potential epitopes was supplemented with 17 peptides identified following mass spectrometry of HLA-bound peptides from ROPN1+ HLA-A2+ TNBC (2 out of 17), from ROPN1+ HLA-A2+ K562ABC cells (1 out of 17), and from datasets of primary tumor samples (14 out of 17; Supplementary Table S2; “Methods”; Supplementary Methods; refs. 38, 39). Notably, one peptide (FLYTIAKV) that was identified in primary tumor samples was also shortlisted based on in silico predictions, yielding a total set of 36 peptides. This set of peptides was then screened for lack of similarity with other source antigens using Expitope software (40). The peptides that were only present in ROPN1/B needed to fulfill minimal binding to HLA-A2 in vitro, after which 21 peptides survived that were further assessed for two parameters: the amplitude (maximal HLA-A2 binding at saturating peptide concentration) and the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50; Methods). Eleven peptides showed binding to HLA-A2 in a dose-dependent manner and were ranked based on amplitude (Fig. 2B).",
        "Retrieval and selection of ROPN1/B peptides according to uniqueness and HLA-A2 avidity, as well as natural TCRs against endogenously processed epitopes. A, Flowchart of retrieval and selection of ROPN1/B peptides according to in silico predictions (n = 20) and peptide elution (n = 17), resulting in n = 37 identified peptides, as well as non-cross-reactivity (n = 21, avidity for HLA-A2 (n = 11) and immunogenicity (n = 9; Methods for details on each tool/assay and Supplementary Table S1 for an overview of the results per tool). B, The table presents the overview of HLA-A2 binding characteristics for the 11 shortlisted peptides that went into T-cell enrichments. The gp100 epitope YLEPGPVTA (YLE) served as a reference epitope. Amplitudes are expressed as FC of median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of anti-HLA-A2-PE relative to YLE at highest peptide concentrations, and EC50 values (mean, calculated via GraphPad Prism 5.0) are listed in molarity (mol/L). C, Dots represent enriched T-cell populations (with peptides from B and each dot representing a single enrichment) according to FC of IFN-γ production compared with irrelevant epitope (RP; left). Epitope stimulated T cells which produced minimally 200 pg/mL, and 2× more IFN-γ than RP stimulated T cells were stained for pMHC binding, which is shown as percentage of CD3+ T cells (right). D, Clonality of TCRα and TCRβ sequences from epitope-specific T-cell populations (from C) are shown as percentage of total number of sequences. E, TCRαβ combinations derived from clonal populations (from D) were introduced into T cells and tested for pMHC binding, again shown as percentage of CD3+ T cells. Each epitope in C–E is shown with a unique color, and when dots are presented in gray, these epitopes did not meet the selection criteria for further characterization (Methods; Supplementary Fig. S8). F, Bar plots represent gene expression of ROPN1/B using MM231 transfectants depicted as FC relative to GAPDH (2−∆Ct) according to RT-qPCR. ROPN1-expressing MM231 cells are visualized in green (n = 3), ROPN1B-expressing MM231 cells in purple (n = 5), and parental MM231 cells (not expressing ROPN1/B) in gray (n = 5). Mean and SD are shown. G, Representative histograms show MFI of GFP expression of ROPN1-expressing MM231 (green), ROPN1B-expressing MM231 (purple), and parental MM231 (not expressing GFP, gray). H, Bar plots display the ability of TCR T cells (from E) to recognize endogenously processed and presented cognate epitope. IFN-γ levels (in pg/mL) were measured upon stimulation of TCR T cells with ROPN1/B-expressing or parental MM231 (F and G). Positive controls are BSM cells loaded with cognate epitope. Mean and SD are shown.",
        "To retrieve ROPN1-specific T cells, these 11 peptides were individually fed to CD11c+ dendritic cells that were cocultured with autologous naïve CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from a set of 13 healthy donors. With our technique (41), which we improved for sensitive detection of epitope-specific T cells, we are able to isolate TCRs from precursor T cells present at low frequencies in healthy individuals, such as those reported for the CGAs MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO (42, 43). Nine out of 11 peptides yielded T cells that demonstrated significant epitope-specific IFN-γ secretion and peptide–MHC binding (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S2A). These epitope-specific T-cell populations were FACS sorted according to peptide–MHC binding or peptide-induced CD137 expression and subjected to bulk TCR sequencing, which revealed oligo or monoclonality for 13 TCRs (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Five sets of genes encoding TCRαβs directed against the epitopes FLYTYIAKV (FLY-1A), FLYTYIAEV (FLY-1B), EVIGPDGLITV (EVI), MLNYIEQEV (MLN), and AQMWKVVNL (AQM) showed surface expression by primary T cells upon retroviral transduction (Fig. 2E; Supplementary Fig. S2C). To test whether these TCRs recognize their cognate epitope following endogenous processing and HLA-A2 presentation, a critical go/no-go parameter for the respective epitope–TCR pair, we cocultured TCR T cells with the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 (MM231) that overexpresses either ROPN1 or ROPN1B (Fig. 2F and G). Transfectants provided robust models to test and select ROPN1 TCRs, which was necessitated by a lack of HLA-A2+ cancer cell lines that naturally express ROPN1. Patient-derived tumor models with endogenous levels of ROPN1 expression have been subsequently applied to validate these TCRs (see below). FLY-1A and 1B TCRs specifically recognized ROPN1+ or ROPN1B+ MM231 cells, respectively (Fig. 2H). In contrast, MLN- and AQM-specific TCRs did not recognize cancer cells expressing ROPN1/B, potentially indicating that these two epitopes are not naturally presented or these TCRs were of a too low affinity for their cognate epitopes (Fig. 2H). The EVI-specific TCR recognized the parental cancer cells that do not express ROPN1/B (Fig. 2H), potentially indicating cross-reactivity to other targets. TCRs specific for the EVI, MLN, and AQM epitopes were therefore excluded from further characterization.",
        "Cross-reactivity of TCR T cells toward other antigens is a potential safety concern, which when overlooked can result in severe side effects. For example, MAGE-A3 TCR T cells being cross-reactive to either Titin, a protein highly expressed in cardiomyocytes, or a protein expressed in brain cells, led to patient deaths when tested in clinical trials (32, 33). To assess the extent of cross-reactivity of the FLY-1A and FLY-1B TCRs (Fig. 3A), we positionally scanned amino acids of the cognate epitopes, replacing each amino acid by any other amino acid to determine which amino acids and which positions are critical for recognition by the corresponding TCR (see “Methods” for details). For both epitopes, we found that most amino acid replacements at positions 3 to 7 resulted in substantial reduction of IFN-γ production by FLY-1A (Fig. 3B) and FLY-1B (Fig. 3C) TCR T cells. With the resulting recognition motif of each TCR (Fig. 3D and E), an in silico search was performed against the complete human proteome to find non-ROPN1 peptides that could theoretically be recognized by either of these two TCRs. Potential peptides coming from this search were shortlisted according to binding to HLA-A2 and recognition by TCR T cells of peptide-pulsed target cells. These analyses revealed that the FLY-1A TCR recognized three non-ROPN1 peptides, namely, CLYVFPAKV (CLY), SIWKFPAKL (SIW), and VLFTYVGKA (VLF), coming from the source antigens (E3-independent) E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBE2O), neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1), and fatty-acid amide hydrolase 1 (FAAH1), respectively (Fig. 3F). Dose titrations demonstrated that half-maximal responses (i.e., sensitivities) of FLY-1A TCR T cells for the CLY and SIW peptides are comparable to the cognate FLY-1A epitope, in which the half-maximal response of this TCR for the VLF peptide is significantly lower compared with the FLY-1A epitope (Fig. 3G). The amplitudes (i.e., absolute quantities of IFN-γ) for all three non-ROPN1 peptides were significantly lower compared with the FLY-1A epitope (Fig. 3G). We subsequently assessed whether these alternative peptides can be processed and presented by TNBC cells transfected with either one of the three source antigens (Fig. 3H and I). Notably, the FLY-1A TCR was unable to recognize TNBC cells overexpressing such source antigens, suggesting that the CLY, SIW, and VLF peptides are not a product of the natural antigen processing and presentation machinery and therefore pose minimal risk to elicit FLY-1A-mediated off-target toxicity (Fig. 3H and I). The FLY-1B TCR could recognize two non-ROPN1B peptides, namely, GMFLYISLA (GMF) and NLYGIVLA (NLY), coming from the source antigens metal cation symporter ZIP8 (SLC39A8) and sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-3 (ATP1A3), respectively (Fig. 3J). Dose titrations demonstrated that half-maximal responses as well as amplitudes of FLY-1B TCR T cells for the GMF and NLY peptides were significantly lower or nonexisting compared with the FLY-1B epitope (Fig. 3K). No further investigation of the natural processing and presentation of these peptides was needed.",
        "TCRs directed against FLY-1A and FLY-1B have a strict recognition motif and specifically recognize cognate but not alternative epitopes. A, Schematic overview of experiments performed to determine TCR specificity (see “Methods” for details). Heatmap shows the relative IFN-γ production by (B) FLY-1A TCR T cells or (C) FLY-1B TCR T cells upon positional amino acid scanning of the cognate epitope. TCR T cells were cocultured with BSM cells loaded with single amino acid variants that cover all amino acids at every position of the cognate epitope (n = 171).

The height of each letter is scaled in bits using the R package ggseqlogo and represents the probability of that amino acid at that position. The colors of the amino acids represent the chemical properties explained below the logo. Motifs were queried against a human protein database using ScanProsite, which yielded 44 non-ROPN1 for FLY-1A TCR T cells and 17 non-ROPN1B peptides for FLY-1B TCR T cells, respectively, that harbored the recognition motif and were predicted to bind to HLA-A2 according to NetMHCpan 4.1.

H, Dot plots display the lack of ability of FLY-1A TCR T cells to recognize endogenously expressed non-ROPN1 source antigens.

        "Following our studies into safety, we set out to investigate the killing capacity of ROPN1-specific TCR T cells using different TNBC models. In a first model, we used tumoroids that were derived from the ROPN1 or ROPN1B-overexpressing MM231 cell line (see “Methods” for details). We noted that FLY-1A and FLY-1B TCR T cells, when loaded on top of these collagen gels, migrated toward and mediated killing of tumoroids expressing ROPN1 and ROPN1B, respectively, over a period of 48 hours. Notably, FLY-1A TCR T cells caused 100% tumoroid killing and outperformed cisplatin (20 μmol/L), which was used as a comparator. FLY-1B TCR T cells could not completely eradicate the tumoroids within the same time frame and performed similarly to cisplatin (Fig. 4A and B).",

        "In a second series of experiments, we used 3D tumor organoids from patient with TNBC-derived xenograft (PDX) tissues that endogenously express ROPN1 and ROPN1B and are positive for HLA-A2. These organoids are also positive for TROP2, which is the target for the drug sacituzumab govitecan, a standard-of-care treatment for metastatic TNBC (Fig. 4C). Again, FLY-1A TCR T cells were highly efficient in killing the patient-derived organoids that endogenously expressed ROPN1 in a dose-dependent manner and more effectively when compared with the killing of organoids by FLY-1B TCR T cells after 48 hours (Fig. 4D and E). Importantly, FLY-1A TCR T cells significantly outperformed cisplatin as well as sacituzumab govitecan (0.1-10 nmol/L). Furthermore, ROPN1-expressing melanoma organoids were also efficiently killed by FLY-1A TCR T cells to a similar extent as the killing of NY-ESO1-expressing melanoids by NY-ESO1 TCR T cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C).",
        "In line with the superiority of FLY-1A versus FLY-1B TCR T cells in both organoid models, there is at least a fivefold difference in effective concentration of cognate epitope that yields half-maximal production of IFN-γ (Fig. 3G and K), pointing to a significantly higher avidity of the FLY-1A TCR T cells. The TCR specific for FLY-1B was therefore excluded from further characterizations.",
        "We extended the in vitro testing of FLY-1A TCR T cells, particularly about their specificity, and assessed T-cell recognition toward cancer cell lines (n = 10) or cell line-derived 3D tumoroids (n = 3) that lack ROPN1 and/or HLA-A2. FLY-1A TCR T cells did not recognize cell lines lacking expression of either ROPN1, HLA-A2, or both (Supplementary Fig. S4A) nor did they recognize tumoroids that lack either ROPN1, HLA-A2, or both (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C). Another line of evidence for lack of cross-reactivity comes from the testing of FLY-1A TCR T cells for their ability to recognize noncognate peptides eluted from HLA-A2. Coculturing of TCR T cells with target cells pulsed with a library of 114 such peptides confirmed the inability of the FLY-1A TCR to recognize noncognate epitopes (Supplementary Fig. S4D). In short, FLY-1A TCR T cells are highly specific for ROPN1+ HLA-A2+ tumor cells and are nonreactive toward tumor cells lacking expression of ROPN1 and/or HLA-A2 as well as noncognate epitopes.",
        "Next, we assessed tumor cell killing as well as pharmacokinetics of FLY-1A TCR T cells in mice engrafted human TNBC (see “Methods”; Fig. 5A). In these experiments, and in line with clinical trials, we preceded the transfer of TCR T cells with lymphodepleting chemotherapy and supported transferred TCR T cells with low-dose IL-2 (see “Methods” for details). In line with the organoid experiments, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with FLY-1A TCR T cells induced a clear and dose-dependent tumor regression, and a single infusion of TCR T cells significantly outperformed repetitive treatment with sacituzumab govitecan (2x/week 0.4 mg/kg) (Fig. 5B–D). In addition, FLY-1A TCR T cells were detected in dose-dependent quantities in tumors as well as in blood samples (Fig. 5E). Notably, mice treated with FLY-1A TCR T cells showed specific enrichment of pMHC+ CD8+ as well as pMHC+ CD4+ T cells within the regressing tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B).",

        "In a final step, moving toward clinical development of the FLY-1A TCR, we questioned whether surface expression of this TCR could be enhanced as a function of preferential pairing between TCRα and TCRβ chains. Upon introduction of exogenous TCRα and TCRβ chains, there is a possibility of mispairing between transgenic chains and endogenous TCR chains. TCR mispairing could generate new TCR combinations with potentially self-reactive specificities (44, 45), but more importantly (as we have already ruled out the recognition of alternative peptides by TCR T cells, Fig. 3), it also dilutes the surface expression of transgenic TCRαβ and consequently limits anti-ROPN1 effectivity. To assess the proneness of the FLY-1A TCR to mispairing, we stained FLY-1A TCR T cells with an antibody specific for its TCR-Vβ13.1 chain as well as with its FLY-1A:HLA-A2 pMHC multimer. We observed equal fractions of TCR T cells being positive for either TCR-Vβ or pMHC [TCR-Vβ: 31% ± 19% (mean ± SD), pMHC: 31% ± 18% of five different donors, Fig. 6A and B], suggesting that all surface-expressed FLY-1A TCRβ chains are complexed with all surface-expressed FLY-1A TCRα chains, thereby enabling maximal binding of the cognate epitope coupled to HLA-A2. In fact, the introduction of a cysteine bridge (Cys) or substitutions of three amino acid residues (LRY), which are reported to reduce mispairing for some TCRs (46, 47), did not result in further improvement of either TCR-Vb expression or binding to pMHC (Fig. 6C).",

        "After having determined that the FLY-1A TCR can be considered a so-called dominant TCR, not needing additional modifications to promote preferential pairing, we manufactured a small-scale FLY-1A TCR T-cell product up to 5 × 108 cells according to an optimized good manufacturing practice (GMP) process yielding highly effective and juvenile TCR T cells (48), currently used in a clinical trial conducted at Erasmus MC (clinicaltrial.gov NCT04729543). These TCR T cells expanded between 25- and 70-fold in 11 days and contained between 51% and 82% pMHC+ cells within the CD3+ T-cell population (Fig. 6D and E). Importantly, we subjected this clinical-like T-cell product to safety and potency assays that comply with current regulations for first inhuman ACT. First, we performed coculture experiments with the FLY-1A TCR T-cell product and HLA-A2+ primary cell lines that were derived from 11 different healthy organs and tissues (Supplementary Table S3). These experiments demonstrated no elevated IFN-γ levels of the TCR T-cell product when compared with the mock T-cell product (Fig. 6F), pointing to no or limited off-target toxicity toward healthy tissues. Note that exogenous loading of these primary cell lines with cognate epitope did evoke a TCR-mediated IFN-γ response (Fig. 6F, purple bars). Second, we performed coculture experiments of the FLY-1A TCR T-cell product with PDX tissues from patients with TNBC and SKCM with endogenous ROPN1 expression. This FLY-1A TCR T-cell product secreted significantly higher levels of IFN-γ upon coculture with ROPN1+ HLA-A2+ TNBC PDX (n = 26 of 8 different ROPN1+ HLA-A2+ PDX’s, Fig. 6G) or SKCM PDX single-cell suspensions (n = 2 of 1 ROPN1+ HLA-A2+ PDX’s, Supplementary Fig. S6A) compared with the mock T-cell product. In line with experiments with cell lines and tumoroids, the FLY-1A TCR T-cell product was nonreactive toward patient tumor samples lacking ROPN1 and/or HLA-A2 (n = 5, Fig. 6G), demonstrating that this TCR T-cell product is tumor reactive and specific in an ex vivo setting. Besides the abovementioned assays, we assessed whether the FLY-1A TCR is functionally expressed by CD4+ T cells, and we separated FLY-1A TCR CD4+ and CD8+ T cells following gene transduction and assessed cytokine production upon coculture with ROPN1+ TNBC cells. We observed that pMHC+ CD4+ T cells as well as their pMHC+ CD8+ counterpart specifically produced IFN-γ and IL-2, suggesting that for its performance the FLY-1A TCR does not require the CD8 coreceptor (Fig. 6H). Finally, we tested the sensitivity of the FLY-1A TCR T-cell product and demonstrated that these T cells recognize the cognate epitope with a functional avidity of 0.1 μmol/L. This avidity measure is comparable to the 0.7 μmol/L avidity of the NY-ESO1 TCR, the latter already being tested in clinical trials in which it induced regression in synovial sarcoma (Fig. 6I; ref. 28). In addition, we observed a positive correlation between ROPN1 mRNA expression in target cells and T-cell IFN-γ production (Spearman’s R = 0.74, n = 78 covering cell lines, PDXs and patient-derived organoids; Supplementary Fig. S7A). Notably, from this correlation, we extracted that the minimal ROPN1 expression required for T-cell recognition equals the lower limit of endogenous expression levels of patient-derived tumor samples. To exemplify the ability of TCR T cells to recognize tumor samples, we demonstrated that FLY-1A TCR T cells effectively kill patient-derived organoids with endogenous ROPN1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S7B).",
        "We have identified ROPN1, a novel target antigen for ACT with no detectable expression in healthy tissue and high and homogenous expression in more than 90% of TNBC, as well as an anti-ROPN1 TCR that demonstrates no cross-reactivity and significant effectiveness in preclinical models when compared with standard-of-care drugs. In this study, we have selected the target antigen, epitope, as well as the corresponding TCR using a stepwise approach and stringent filtering according to criteria for therapeutic safety as well as efficacy (Supplementary Fig. S8). It is noteworthy that these selections, when applying such criteria, are accompanied by a high number of dropouts. In fact, we started with nearly 300 antigens, 200 epitopes, and more than 25 TCRs, pointing to a selection stringency, at least for the TCRs, of 10% or less. These numbers may vary for different antigens and different tumor types but do point out that a high number of antigens, epitopes, and TCRs are not suited for clinical application and should be identified and dismissed early on during the preclinical development of ACT.",
        "Currently, one of the critical challenges for ACT to treat solid tumors is the lack of suitable tumor-specific targets. Ideally, a suitable target is absent from healthy tissue, which would derisk the occurrence of autoreactivity following treatment with T cells. The search into suitable targets was triggered by our earlier study with CAR T cells that were directed against carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) antigen-positive renal cell carcinoma (49, 50). In this phase I trial, we observed serious adverse events likely because of recognition by CAR T cells of epithelial cells covering larger bile ducts and expressing low levels of CAIX antigen. To limit the chances of such on-target, off-tumor toxicity, we have stringently selected ROPN1 antigen for its absent expression in adult healthy tissues. In fact, we have extensively tested the absence of ROPN1 in healthy tissues using gene expressions from databases covering 1,479 individuals and 66 tissues, cDNA libraries covering 48 tissues, as well as immune stainings covering 14 major tissues. The only healthy tissues found to express ROPN1 are testis and epididymis, in which this protein is expressed in the fibrous sheath of sperm cells likely contributing to their motility (51). Not only are these tissues immune privileged, these tissues are also absent in female patients with TNBC, all in all indicative of a minimal risk for on-target off-tumor toxicity. The safety profile of ROPN1 extends that of other CGAs, such as MAGE-C2, NY-ESO1, and MAGE-A4, which are being targeted (clinicaltrial.gov NCT04729543) or already have been targeted to treat melanoma and synovial sarcoma (28, 29).",
        "Besides its absence from adult healthy tissues, ROPN1 is highly and homogeneously present in tumor tissues from less than 300 patients with TNBC, even in the metastatic setting and independent of pretreatments. The striking abundance and homogeneity of ROPN1/B in TNBC likely limit the risk of tumor recurrence following ACT since it is reported that outgrowth of antigen-negative tumor cell clones is generally a consequence of low and heterogeneous expression of target antigens within tumors (27, 52, 53). Notably, a recent report highlighted that ROPN1 may act as an oncogene and drive metastasis formation in vivo and demonstrated an inverse correlation between ROPN1 expression and survival of patients with TNBC (54), further highlighting the therapeutic value of ROPN1 as a target for ACT.",
        "Moving from target antigen to epitopes, we have applied in silico and laboratory tools to select potential T-cell epitopes according to predicted values for peptide processing and presentation, supplemented with peptides eluted from HLA, and actual binding to HLA-A2. Furthermore, ROPN1 peptides were selected that lack homology to non-ROPN1/B sequences in the human proteome to prevent potential off-target toxicities. Following shortlisting, 11 peptides remained, of which eight were predicted, two were eluted, and one peptide (FLY-1A) was predicted and eluted (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Interestingly, although numbers are limited, there is little concordance between in silico predictions and immunopeptidomics. To retrieve ROPN1-specific T cells, these 11 peptides were loaded onto dendritic cells that were cocultured with autologous CD8+ T cells from healthy donors. Using an optimized detection protocol (41), we were able to retrieve ROPN1/B-specific T-cell populations against nine out of 11 peptides, substantiating the reported notion that precursor T cells specific for CGAs are present, albeit at low frequencies, in healthy individuals (42, 43).",
        "From these T-cell populations, we obtained 13 TCRαβs against five epitopes that showed oligo- or mono-clonality, of which one TCRαβ against each epitope was surface expressed upon gene transfer into primary human T cells. Of note, we have used bulk rather than single-cell methods to identify TCR sequences and, consequently, have not directly identified single-cell pairs of TCRα and β chains. This potentially implies that low frequency or subclonal TCRs may have been missed, for which reason we recommend single-cell sequencing for future retrievals of TCR sequences. When zooming in on T-cell avidity for these five TCRs, we observed a range between 0.1 and 4 μmol/L, which is comparable to the avidity observed for the reference TCR directed against NY-ESO1 (Fig. 6I), demonstrating the feasibility of retrieving highly specific TCRs with relatively high natural affinity from naïve repertoires. Next, in a critical “go/no-go step,” these TCRs directed against ROPN1/B were challenged for their ability to recognize processed and naturally presented peptides by TNBC cells. To this end, we have generated ROPN1/1B transfected cell lines enabling the selection of TCRs. Only the FLY-1A and FLY-1B TCRs survived this test, and the other three TCRs did not, after which the two former TCRs were subjected to extensive safety and efficacy analyses.",
        "In recognition of the fact that transfectants are not truly representing tumor cells, we validated ROPN1/1B TCRs with the use of patient TNBC and melanoma-derived tissues as well as organoids. Importantly, these tumor models showed ROPN1 positivity that is concordant with what we observed with TNBC patient-derived tissues, namely, that ROPN1 is expressed in the vast majority of primary and metastatic patients with TNBC on gene and protein levels (Fig. 1). When testing FLY-1A and FLY-1B TCR T cells for their antitumor performance in these models, we demonstrated that FLY-1A TCR T cells outperformed FLY-1B TCR T cells with respect to the eradication of ROPN1(B)+ and HLA-A2+ 3D TNBC as well as melanoma organoids, which is likely linked to their higher functional avidity. In fact, the functional avidity of FLY-1A TCR T cells is slightly higher compared with NY-ESO1 TCR T cells (0.1 and 0.7 μmol/L, respectively), with the latter TCR (termed 1G4-α95:LY) already having shown clinical efficacy in treating melanoma and sarcoma patients (55, 56). Furthermore, the FLY-1A TCR is CD8 coreceptor independent and is expressed in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and FLY-1A TCR-expressing CD4+ T cells produce IFN-γ and IL2 upon stimulation with epitope, characteristics that may aid in engaging CD4+ T cells in an anti-ROPN1 response (57, 58), which are considered critical for inducing durable immune responses. The FLY-1A TCR T cells showed clear tumor infiltration and effective antitumor effects when tested in TNBC-bearing mice. Importantly, the FLY-1A TCR T cells significantly surpassed the antitumor effects seen with standard-of-care drugs, including cisplatin and sacituzumab govitecan, in tumoroid and mouse models.",
        "Finally, in preparation of a clinical application, we assessed the FLY-1A TCR for its dominance about surface expression and demonstrated that the pairing of the transgenic TCRα and TCRβ chains could not be improved by cysteine or LRY modifications as described previously (46, 59, 60). With the nonmodified wild-type FLY-1A TCR, we manufactured a clinical-like T-cell product according to an optimized GMP protocol yielding T cells enriched for a young phenotype (according to CD45RO− and CCR7+; ref. 48) and which protocol is currently used in a clinical trial at Erasmus MC to treat MAGE-C2+ melanoma. Notably, this FLY-1A TCR T-cell product passed preclinical safety and potency assays. For example, this product was nonreactive to primary cell cultures derived from healthy organs. This, together with this TCR specifically recognizing cognate but not alternative epitopes, showing no proneness to mispair, and not mediating a response to ROPN1- and/or HLA-A2-negative tumor cells, is indicative of a minimal risk for off-target, off-tumor toxicity. Also, this FLY-1A TCR T-cell product showed a potent response toward patient tumor samples. In fact, T-cell IFN-γ production correlates with ROPN1 gene expression, in which the minimal ROPN1 expression required for T-cell recognition equals the lower limit of endogenous expression levels of patient-derived tumor samples.",
        "Even though the preclinical data argue in favor of a highly specific and sensitive T-cell product to treat TNBC or melanoma, one cannot exclude that toxicities and/or lack of an antitumor response may occur in some patients. With respect to safety, the next step would be to test T cells gene engineered with this TCR in a clinical trial according to dose titration. To this end, the preparation of a clinical vector batch and its quality release is being scheduled. With respect to efficacy, we have previously reported that the immunosuppressive microenvironment of TNBC underlies resistance to anti-PD1 and can be grouped according to the presence and spatial phenotype of CD8+ T cells (61). For example, the excluded phenotype, with CD8+ T cells being confined to the tumor margins, harbors dense extracellular matrix and associates with activation of the TGFβ pathway; the ignored phenotype, with no CD8+ T cells, harbors CD163+ myeloid cells and associates with activation of the WNT pathway, whereas the inflamed phenotype, with CD8+ T cells present in tumor and stromal regions, reveals necrosis and enhanced expression of T-cell coinhibitory receptors. To study immune evasive mechanisms following treatment with FLY-1A TCR T cells, we are currently scheduling the testing of adoptive therapy in an immune-competent tumor model. Interestingly, high ROPN1 expression is observed independently of these spatial CD8 T-cell phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. S9A). Moreover, ROPN1 expression is also not related to response to anti-PD1 (Supplementary Fig. S9B, data from TONIC trial; ref. 62). Interestingly, however, patients with ROPN1+ HLA-A2+ metastatic TNBC who responded to anti-PD1 show an enrichment of the frequency of the FLY-1A TCRβ chain in blood (Supplementary Fig. S9C). These preliminary findings suggest that the targeting of ROPN1 may be agnostic for the type of immune suppression as well as the type of pretreatment and that the ROPN1 TCRβ may take part in an effective anti-TNBC response.",
        "In summary, we have identified ROPN1 as novel and safe target present in the majority of TNBC patients for ACT and selected the FLY-1A TCR that is highly specific and shows high therapeutic value in advanced tumor models, in which it outperforms current treatment options. Currently, T cells gene engineered with this TCR are scheduled for use in a clinical trial to treat patients with TNBC or other ROPN1-positive cancers.",

For details on predicted features of these algorithms, see Hammerl and colleagues (81). For immunopeptidomics, the ROPN1/B-expressing HLA-A2+ MM231 cells (3 × 108) were treated with 50 pg/mL human recombinant IFN-γ (PreproTech, Cat# 300-02) for 24 hours and harvested using EDTA before immunoprecipitation of MHC class I molecules. In addition, 1 × 108 ROPN1B-expressing HLA-A2+ K562ABC cells were treated with epigenetic drugs (treatment regimen as described in ref. 82) prior to immunoprecipitation. K562ABC cells are K562 lymphoblastic cells that are engineered to express HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C alleles and are typically used for antigen presentation research. Peptides were eluted and measured with mass spectrometry as described previously (Supplementary Methods; refs. 38, 83). Lastly, peptides were searched in available databases of peptides eluted from tumor tissues as well as cell lines (https://www.zhang-lab.org/caatlas/). All peptides identified through immunopeptidomics were used for below-described analysis, even when they not mapped to HLA-A2.",
        "The top 10 predicted peptides per in silico tool as well as unique peptides (not overlapping with the predicted peptides) retrieved from immunopeptidomics were checked for cross-reactivity with Expitope (40). Peptides that overlapped with peptides from non-ROPN1/B human proteins with up to two amino acid mismatches (i.e., seven out of nine amino acids are identical) were excluded from further analysis. The final list of peptides was ordered at ThinkPeptides (ProImmune, Oxford, United Kingdom), dissolved in 50% to 75% DMSO, and stored at −20°C until use. The HLA-A2 stabilization assay was performed using T2 cells with a slightly adapted protocol (Supplementary Methods; ref. 84). In brief, T2 cells were exposed to titrated amounts of peptide (range from 31 nmol/L to 31 μmol/L, n = 3), and HLA-A2 expression using an HLA-A2-PE antibody (clone BB7.2, 1:20, Abcam Cat #ab79523, RRID:AB_1640177) was measured using flow cytometry (FACS Celesta, BD, RRID:SCR_019597) and analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.7.1, TreeStar, RRID:SCR_008520).",
        "We calculated two parameters of binding avidity to HLA-A2: (i) amplitude, which was the difference in fluorescence intensity between the highest concentration and baseline, and (ii) half-maximal effective concentration (EC50), which is the calculated concentration of peptide (using GraphPad Prism 5.0, RRID:SCR_002798) giving half-maximal response. Eleven peptides adhered to the following two criteria: (i) EC50 of less than1 × 10−4 mol/L and (ii) binding amplitude of more than 0.5 relative to the reference peptide gp100YLE; these peptides were ranked according to amplitude values.",
        "Enrichment of epitope-specific T cells was performed by coculturing naïve T cells with autologous CD11c+ cells that were loaded with the shortlisted peptides using PBMCs from two to seven healthy donors per tested peptide. Following the first coculture cycle, ROPN1-specific T cells were amplified over another three cycles using peptide-pulsed autologous PBMC supplemented with medium containing common g cytokines according to a protocol we have previously described (41). Following enrichment, T cells were tested for ROPN1 and/or ROPN1B epitope-specific IFN-γ production. To this end, a supernatant from overnight cocultures of T cells with T2 cells (1 × 106/mL) that were pulsed with epitope (10 ng/mL) was collected, and IFN-γ production was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BioLegend, Cat #430115) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. T2 cells loaded with an irrelevant epitope were included as a negative control. T-cell IFN-γ was considered epitope-specific in case levels exceeded 200 pg/mL, and levels were minimally twice as high as for irrelevant epitope. T cells that fulfilled these criteria were stained with peptide:MHC (pMHC) tetramers (Tetramer Shop) to determine the frequency of epitope-specific T cells. Events were acquired with FACS Celesta and analyzed using FlowJo software. In case T-cell binding of pMHC was observed in more than 0.5% of CD3+ T cells, these cells were FACS sorted with pMHC multimers.",
        "CD8+ T cells were exposed to the SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech/Takara, Cat #634858) to identify and annotate ROPN1/B epitope-specific TCRα and TCRαβ chains based on Kunert and colleagues (82). Using the IMGT database and the HighV-QUEST tool (http://www.imgt.org, RRID:SCR_012780), the TCR-V, TCR-D, and TCR-J sequences were annotated according to the Lefranc nomenclature (85, 86). In case for a given T-cell population, TCRα sequences represented 30% or more of all functional sequences of TCRα and the same for TCRβ (i.e., >30% clonal sequences of TCRα and TCRβ), and then those TCR chains were matched with each other. These sets of TCRα and TCRβs were codon optimized (GeneArt) and cloned into the pMP71 vector (a kind gift of Prof. Wolfgang Uckert, MDC, Berlin, Germany; ref. 87) using a TCRβ2A-TCRα cassette.",
        "Upon activation with anti-CD3 Monoclonal Antibody (OKT3, Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat #16-0037-81, RRID:AB_468854), PBMCs from healthy donors were transduced with TCR-encoding retroviruses (pMP71) or empty vector that were produced by a coculture of 293T and Phoenix-Ampho packaging cells, as described previously (88, 89). Staining for surface-expressed TCR transgenes was performed using pMHC dextramers (Immudex; ref. 90). In case pMHC complexes were insensitive to detect TCR T cells, we used antibodies directed against TCR-Vβ (antihuman TCR-Vβ7.1, clone ZOE, Beckman Coulter Cat# IM2287, RRID:AB_131323) and CD137-APC (1:25, BD Biosciences Cat# 550890, RRID:AB_398477). The expression of CD137 was measured following 48-hour stimulation with epitope-loaded BSM melanoma cells. In case pMHC or CD137 expression in more than 5% of CD3+ T cells was observed in at least two donors, TCR T cells were then MACS sorted using pMHC complexes or FACS sorted according to upregulated CD137 expression.",
        "TCR-transduced T cells (6 × 104/well in a 96-well round-bottom tissue culture-treated plate) were cocultured with target cells (2 × 104/well) in a total volume of 200 μL RPMI medium supplemented with 25 mmol/L HEPES, 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 1% antibiotics for 24 hours. Parental or ROPN1/B-expressing MM231 tumor cells were pretreated for 48 hours with IFN-γ prior to coculture. T-cell recognition of endogenously processed and presented epitopes was demonstrated in case IFN-γ levels exceeded 200 pg/mL, and levels were minimally twice as high as for mock T cells. To test the sensitivity of FLY-1A and FLY-1B TCR T cells, T cells were cocultured with BSM cells loaded with epitope concentrations ranging from 1 pmol/L to 30 μmol/L to determine EC50 values.",
        "Positional amino acid scanning of ROPN1/B epitopes was performed to assess the recognition motifs of TCRs. TCR T cells were cocultured with BSM cells that were pulsed with alternative peptides (i.e., 10 μg/mL) covering all individual amino acids as replacements at every single position in the cognate ROPN1/B epitope (n = 171). Critical amino acid substitutions were defined as those that resulted in at least a 90% drop in IFN-γ production when compared with the cognate epitope. Once having identified alternative peptides that contained such critical amino acid(s), we could assign a fold change value (FC) for every amino acid at every position relative to the cognate epitope. We calculated the frequency per amino acid at every position by dividing the FC of each amino acid by the sum of FCs of all amino acids per position. The resulting frequency matrix was used as input to create the sequence logo presented in bits with the R package ggseqlogo (91). The resulting recognition motif was scanned for its occurrence in the human proteome using the ScanProsite tool (RRID:SCR_024425; ref. 92). Non-ROPN1/B peptides that contained the recognition motif were scored for their in silico binding to HLA-A2 with the NetMHCpan 4.1 software (77). HLA-A2 binders (weak as well as strong binders) were subsequently synthesized and tested for their capability to induce responses by ROPN1/B TCR T cells. To this end, alternative peptides were loaded onto BSM cells and tested at a single dose of 10 μg/mL, and those that resulted in T-cell IFN-γ secretion (FC > 0.1 compared with the cognate epitope) were used to determine EC50 values according to dose titrations. Importantly, non-ROPN1/B source antigens that harbor such peptides were overexpressed in MM231 cells, after which these MM231 cells were cocultured with TCR T cells. Only in case there was no reactivity by TCR T cells toward alternative source antigens, the peptide was considered not to be a product of endogenous processing and presentation. Finally, TCR T cells were screened for a lack of reactivity toward 114 HLA-A2-eluted noncognate peptides (34).",
        "TCR T cells were subjected to tracking and monitoring in three-dimensional (3D) tumoroid models of ROPN1/B-GFP-expressing MM231 cells and patient-derived organoids from breast and skin tumors.",
        "To this end, we used image-guided injection of droplets with tumor cells into a collagen gel to form extracellular matrix (ECM)-embedded tumoroids as described previously (93–95). Overnight, gels were overlayed with a T-cell medium containing 0.4 μmol/L propidium iodide (PI). Subsequently, TCR or mock T cells were labeled with 0.1 μg/mL Hoechst 33242 (Invitrogen Cat# H1399) for 1 hour, and 50,000 labeled T cells were dispersed on top of the collagen gel. Some tumoroids were treated with 20 μmol/L cisplatin as a positive control for tumor cell killing. Tumoroids were imaged at indicated time points by confocal microscopy using either a Nikon TE2000 equipped with a prior stage controlled by NIS-Elements software (RRID:SCR_014329) or a confocal Opera Phenix High Content Screening System (PerkinElmer, RRID: SCR_021100) equipped with a ×10 air objective (NA 0.3) and a temperature- and CO2-controlled incubator. Approximately 10 to 15 μmol/L Z-stacks were captured spanning the entire tumoroid using a 10× or 20× objective. Images were stitched where necessary and analyzed by either CellProfiler (v 2.2.0, RRID:SCR_007358) or Harmony High Content Imaging and Analysis Software (RRID:SCR_018809). A maximum projection was generated through summing of Hoechst, GFP, and PI signals in each image.",
        "Organoid models from PDX derived from breast and skin tumors were established as described (96). PDX organoids (BR5010B and ME12086B) were seeded in 3D hydrogel (Proprietary, Crown Bioscience Netherlands B.V.) in 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One B.V.) and incubated for 48 hours. TCR T cells were stained with cell tracker (CellTracker Green CMFDA Dye, Invitrogen Cat# C2925), resuspended in T-cell medium, and added on top of the 3D hydrogel at three different ratios of organoids to T cells. Cisplatin and sacituzumab govitecan were added to tumor organoids at 0.1, 1, and 10 μmol/L and 0.1, 1, and 10 nmol/L, respectively. After 48 and 96 hours, plates were fixed and stained, and tumor volumes were analyzed. Imaging was performed using ImageXpress Micro XLS (Molecular Devices, RRID:SCR_025259) with a 4× NIKON objective. Image analysis was performed using Ominer software. The segmentation index provides a measure of viable cells in a given image. To this end, this index integrates multiple masking operations to isolate and analyze either DAPI (parameter: nuclei), TRITC (actin), or FITC (cell tracker, in this case immune cells). It integrates multiple masking operations to signal, ultimately identifying viable tumor organoids. Experiments and analyses were performed by personnel at the premises of Crown Bioscience, Netherlands, Leiden (Supplementary Methods).",
        "ROPN1-expressing MM231 tumor cells (2.5 × 106) were suspended in Matrigel and subcutaneously (sc) transplanted in the right flank of 8- to 12-week-old female NSG mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, Charles River Laboratories, RRID:IMSR_JAX:005557). Tumor engraftment and treatment regimen were carried out as described previously (97) with only minor changes. In short, mice (25–30 g) bearing established tumors (mean 217 mm3, range 120–318 mm3) were divided over five treatment groups for equal tumor size distribution (n = 9 per T-cell treatment group, in total n = 36 mice). Mice received a single intravenous (iv) transfer of 0.6, 3, or 15 × 106 human TCR or mock T cells followed by sc IL2 injections (1 × 105 IU) for eight consecutive days following T-cell transfer. Alternatively, mice (n = 5) received two iv injections per week of sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy, Gilead Sciences Ireland UC; 0.4 mg/kg according to the manufacturer’s instructions). At day 11, tumor regressions were measured relative to day 0, and tumor regression in mice treated with TCR T cells was compared with mock T cells and sacituzumab govitecan. In addition, blood (n = 9 mice) and tumor (n = 4 mice) samples were collected at day 8/9 to detect transferred T cells with flow cytometry. Single-cell suspensions were obtained from the tumors using collagenase treatment as described above.

        "The mispairing between the transgenic and endogenous TCR genes was assessed by transducing T cells with the wild-type or modified TCRαβ chains or the TCRβ chain only. We applied two separate modifications of TCR chains, namely, the introduction of a cysteine bridge or the LRY amino acids, which have both been reported to enhance preferential pairing between the transgenic TCRα and TCRβ chains (46, 47).

        "Significance StatementOsteoarthritis is the main disabling musculoskeletal disorder in adults, for which presently available treatments are only of marginal benefit. This trial provides evidence of safety and efficacy of a highly accessible allogeneic cell source that had not been tested in knee osteoarthritis, in spite of its well‐known biological advantages. Even if these results should be confirmed in larger trials, they point the way to a simple, scalable cell‐based therapy open to repeated applications with no need for invasive surgical procedures.",

Even if these results should be confirmed in larger trials, they point the way to a simple, scalable cell‐based therapy open to repeated applications with no need for invasive surgical procedures.",
        "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease, leading to chronic pain, poor quality of life, and increased mortality 1, 2, 3. This imposes a major social burden due to elevated health care costs and premature workforce retirement 4, 5. However, despite decades of research, no true disease‐modifying OA drugs are described, and clinical effects of pharmacological interventions remain of short duration. In consequence, current aims have been directed toward the development of newer cell‐based therapies. Initial attempts aiming at joint repair with autologous chondrocytes 6, 7, thus requiring surgical harvest and implantation, have been in part replaced by the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), because they have both the capacity for self‐renewal and expansion, as well as inflammation‐dependent homing mechanisms associated with tissue restoring properties 8, 9, 10.",
        "In animal models of induced OA, from mouse to horse, MSC transplantation has been able to prevent, halt, or even reverse cartilage degradation 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Most human data from clinical series emerge from individuals with underlying OA‐predisposing conditions that require surgical intervention, such as meniscal tears or focal chondral defects (FCDs). In such cases, improvements in pain, histologic, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphologic scores have been noted 16, 17, 18.",
        "However, MSC therapy is also being assessed now in patients with diffuse knee OA. Indeed, three pilot studies of autologous cell therapy with bone marrow (BM)‐MSCs or adipose‐derived (AD)‐MSCs have been reported, suggesting early evidence of clinical efficacy at 6 months follow‐up 19, 20, 21. In addition, a single phase I trial has tested allogeneic BM‐MSCs, also reporting improvements in joint pain and function 22. Since we and others have shown that umbilical cord‐derived‐MSCs (UC‐MSCs) exhibit higher clonogenic, proliferative, and migration potential than BM‐MSCs, as well as improved secretion of relevant chondrogenic factors 23, 24, interest in UC‐MSCs as a more potent cell source suitable for allogeneic MSC‐based therapy has expanded 25. More than 3,000 patients have received allogeneic MSC treatment for different conditions, and no event linked to allo reactivity has been reported 26.",
        "We therefore decided to test this easily accessible and well‐characterized source of MSCs in a phase I/II controlled, randomized, triple‐blind trial, comparing single or double intra‐articular injection of UC‐MSCs, with an approved viscosupplementation treatment, in individuals with knee OA.",
        "The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02580695) and planned as a phase I/II randomized, double‐blind, controlled trial assessing the safety and efficacy of single or repeated doses of intra‐articular UC‐MSCs, compared with repeated doses of intra‐articular hyaluronic acid (HA) in patients with knee OA. It was approved prior to patient recruitment by a Chilean Ministry of Health Ethics Committee (CECSSMO131015) and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.",
        "The target population included individuals of 40–65 years of age, recruited between November 2015 and January 2016 at the University of los Andes Clinical Center in Santiago, Chile, and meeting the following inclusion criteria: symptomatic knee OA (defined by daily pain at the affected joint for at least 3 months before inclusion) with grade 1–3 Kellgren‐Lawrence radiographic changes in the targeted knee, without meniscal rupture. Patients were excluded if they had bilateral symptomatic knee OA, condylar or tibial plateau generalized bone marrow edema on MRI, major axial deviation defined by valgus (>10°) or varus (5°) deformity of the involved leg, use of oral or intra‐articular steroids or hyaluronic acid in the past 6 months, ipsilateral hip or ankle pain, local or systemic infection, any form of secondary arthritis, previous malignancy, or body mass index ≥30. All randomized patients provided written informed consent.",
        "Forty individuals were screened, leading to the randomized allocation by electronic data entry system of 29 patients at a 1:1:1 ratio, into the three study groups receiving intra‐articular knee injections of HA at baseline and 6 months (Control group, n = 8); UC‐MSCs at baseline and 6 months (MSC‐2 group, n = 9), or UC‐MSCs only at baseline, followed by placebo at 6 months (MSC‐1 group, n = 9; Fig. 1). MSC injections contained 20 × 106 UC‐MSCs in 3 cc of saline with 5% AB plasma, HA injections contained 3 cc of Durolane, and placebo injections contained 5% AB plasma in 3 cc of saline.",
        "Flow chart. Abbreviation: MSC, mesenchymal stromal cell.",
        "The primary endpoint of the trial was the safety of UC‐MSC treatment, according to the number of treatment‐related adverse events (AEs) reported for each study group as coded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event classification. AEs were documented at each visit and described in terms of incidence, severity, and relatedness with intra‐articular infiltration. The secondary endpoint of the trial was efficacy, as assessed by the following validated clinical outcome scales: Western Ontario and Mc Master Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) Spanish validated version 27, Pain Visual Analog scale (VAS), Quality of life by the Short‐form 36 (SF‐36) questionnaire 28, Patient Global Assessment, and the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Committee (OMERACT)‐Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) Responder Index Criteria 29. WOMAC was registered according to Likert Scale version using the following descriptors for each item: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), and extreme (4). Final scores are the sum of items in each subscale, ranging 0–20 for pain, 0–8 for stiffness, and 0–68 for physical function. Knee MRI assessments were performed and assessed blindly by a single radiologist at baseline, at 6 months, and at 12 months, according to the Whole‐Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) 30.",
        "All injections were performed by two orthopedic surgeons in the study, blinded to the component being injected, in syringes equal in volume (3 cc) and external aspect, using an anterolateral approach at the medial joint line with 90° of knee flexion. Patients were encouraged to avoid physical activity for 48 hours after the procedure. Acetaminophen (1 g every 8 hours) was allowed as needed in case of pain.",
        "Clinical outcome and trial assessments were evaluated at intervals of 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks by another orthopedic surgeon in the study, not involved in the treatment procedures and blinded to patient allocation.",
        "The UC‐MSCs for this trial (Cellistem‐OA, Cells for Cells, Chile) were manufactured as previously described 23, and have been extensively characterized by our group 24. Briefly, treatments were processed in an International Organization for Standardization 9001:2015‐certified Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)‐type Laboratory (Cells for Cells, Santiago, Chile), under GMP conditions according to the Food and Drug Administration Guidance for industry (current good tissue practice and additional requirements for manufacturers of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue‐based products). Umbilical cords were obtained from full‐term human placentas by cesarean section after informed consent, from healthy donors, and were aseptically stored in sterile phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, U.S.). Within 3 hours of birth, the umbilical cord was sectioned and washed with PBS and antibiotics. Wharton's jelly was dissected into small fragments (1–2 mm), seeded in 100‐mm culture plates, and maintained in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM) Alpha Modifications (Alfa‐MEM) high glucose (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, U.S.) supplemented with 10% heat‐inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, U.S.), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mM L‐glutamine (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, U.S.). At 48 hours, nonadherent cells were removed and washed with PBS, and culture medium was replaced with fresh medium every 3 days. When the cell culture reached 70%–80% confluence, cells were detached by treatment with TrypLE TM Express (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, U.S.) and reseeded at a density of 2,500 cells per cm2 into 500‐cm2 flasks (Nunc, Denmark). At passage 3, UC‐MSC were characterized according to the International Society for Cellular Therapy Guidelines 30, harvested, and cryopreserved in Profreeze (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) following the manufacturer's instruction. Cell size and doubling time, senescence markers, paracrine and immunomodulatory activity, and migration capacity of UC‐MSCs as compared with BM‐MSCs have been described elsewhere (RIMECARD trial) 23, 24. The protocol is patented by Cells for Cells, request number 201702357.",
        "For the trial, cells were thawed and expanded until passage 5 using Alfa‐MEM supplemented with 10% AB plasma. Cells were detached by treatment with TrypLE TM Express and washed twice with PBS prior to final suspension and packaging. The release criteria for clinical use of UC‐MSC comprised the absence of macroscopic clumps, contaminating pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, mycoplasma, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, cytomegalovirus, and fungi), or endotoxin (≤0.5 EU/mL); and a viability >80%, with an identity and purity pattern characterized by ≥95% positivity for CD73, CD90, and CD105, and negativity (≤2%) for the expression of CD45, CD34, CD14, and Human Leukocyte Antigen‐DR isotype (HLA‐DR). Cells (20 × 106) were suspended in a final volume of 3 mL (saline solution, 5% AB plasma) and dispensed in masked 5‐mL syringes to treat individual patients accordingly with the study design.",

        "To ensure compliance of our cell source with the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) defined criteria for MSC identification 31, compliant good manufacturing process (cGMP) manufactured UC‐MSC batches were also evaluated for tri‐differentiation to mesodermic lineages. Cells were thawed, grown under specific culture conditions, and stained for detection of adipogenic (Oil Red O), osteogenic (Alizarin Red), and chondrogenic (Safranin O) differentiation (Fig. 2A).",
        "UC‐MSC batches with satisfactory tri‐differentiation were further evaluated for proliferation rate, according to the calculated doubling times (DTs). The batch selected for the trial (CU 108–6) had the best DT values (33.8 vs. 39.9, 95% confidence interval −10.8 to −1.3, p = .01, compared with CU 745–3; Fig. 2B).",
        "We assessed thrombospondin‐2 (TSP2) secretion as described by Jeong et al. given its role in chondrogenic differentiation 32. TSP2 enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay was performed according to manufacturer instructions (DuoSet Human Thrombospondin‐2, R&D Systems, DY1635) with supernatants from the tested MSCs in passage 5. As indicated in Figure 2C, we selected the MSC source with higher TSP‐2 secretion to expand a single batch for all patients in the treatment arm of the trial.",
        "Sample description included the frequencies of each category for qualitative variables and mean plus SD for quantitative variables. To examine whether differences in qualitative variables were significant among treatment groups at baseline and during follow‐up, a Freeman–Halton extension of Fisher's exact test was performed for contingency tables of 2×3 and a Fisher's exact test for contingency tables of 2×2. A Kruskal‐Wallis one‐way analysis of variance‐by‐ranks was used to test significant differences in quantitative variables among treatment groups (HA, MSC‐1, MSC‐2) at baseline and during follow‐up. To detect statistical differences between treatments after Kruskal‐Wallis analysis was significant, we performed a multiple comparison of mean ranks. Significance level was set at 5% for all tests, and all statistical analyses were performed using the R platform (v3.4.1; R Development Core Team) in adherence to Good Statistical Practice in Clinical Research.",

        "When comparing how often patients in the trial would achieve responder status at study endpoint, as defined by the OMERACT‐OARSI responder index criteria, all individuals in the repeated MSC group were found to be responders as opposed to 62.5% of patients in the control HA group, a tendency that did not reach significance (p = .08; Fig. 3D).",
        "No evidence of chondral damage or intra‐articular calcifications was detected upon standardized MRI studies at either 24 or 48 weeks of follow‐up. Also, no change from baseline imaging or among groups was found in any of the 14 items composing the WORMS score (Table 4).",

        "This trial examined the safety and efficacy of both single and repeated injections of UC‐MSCs in patients with symptomatic knee OA as compared with intra‐articular HA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of UC‐MSCs in knee OA, and also the first trial of repeated intra‐articular MSC injections. No safety signals were detected in the experimental groups as compared with HA controls. At the end of the study follow‐up (12 months), the group with repeated UC‐MSC intra‐articular injections (20 × 106 every 6 months) experienced significant clinical changes in total WOMAC, pain component, and VAS when compared with HA (Table 3). Compared with baseline, only patients in the MSC groups experienced significant amelioration of pain and disability at 6 and 12 months of follow‐up as opposed to the control HA group (Fig. 3). Finally, no significant differences in the MRI scores were detected among the study groups (Table 4).",
        "MSCs exhibit anti‐inflammatory properties in response to tissue damage and/or pro‐inflammatory states that lead to widespread suppressive effects on the maturation of dendritic cells, macrophages, Natural Killer (NK), and cytotoxic T lymphocytes 33. They have also been shown to promote a pool of endogenous cells to proliferate and contribute to chondrogenesis by renewing extracellular matrix and chondral synthesis of type II collagen 34. But despite the capacity of MSCs to differentiate into mesodermal cell lineages including cartilage, initial regenerative claims concerning therapeutic effects in OA have been revised given the more recent evidence suggesting that paracrine and anti‐inflammatory actions are crucial with respect to the tissue‐restoring effects of MSC treatments 35.",
        "For example, Ichiseki et al. 36 have examined the role of MSCs in an enzymatic rat OA model. When cells were injected intra‐articularly, an increase in the expression of TNF‐α‐stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG‐6) was observed in the joint cartilage, with no expression in the control group. A reduction of metalloprotease A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS5) levels was evidenced as well. TSG‐6 has been reported as a mediator of the beneficial effect of MSCs in both cardiac and lung injury models of tissue damage. On the other hand, the expression of anti‐Calcitonin Gene‐Related Peptide in the C5 dorsal horn of the OA animals was also significantly decreased, indicating a suppressive effect on the central sensitization component of pain. Saulnier et al. 37 confirmed the reduced expression of metalloproteinases (1, 3, and 13) after MSC injection, but describe that MSC‐conditioned medium can also convey these anti‐inflammatory effects on OA synoviocytes. In sum, MSC treatments are known to induce potent anti‐inflammatory, tissue‐restoring, and analgesic effects that could explain the clinical findings described in recent trials as well as in the present phase I/II study.",
        "Indeed, the size of the effect for clinical response of the VAS score in this trial reached 0.81 for cell therapy, evidencing a high symptomatic impact, leading to a number needed‐to‐treat of only 2.1. Such an effect surpasses the usual findings reported for intra‐articular placebo or HA according to recent meta‐analyses 38, 39, 40. Somehow underscoring these effects, the OARSI clinical responder status was achieved by all (100%) MSC‐2 group patients at 6 and 12 months. This is usually achieved only in 50%–60% of patients receiving intra‐articular steroids or HA during initial (3–6 months) follow‐up 41, 42. Our own data confirmed this trend, but without reaching significance (100% vs. 62%, p = .08; Fig. 3). Taken together, our findings suggest that clinical impact of UC‐MSC treatment is beyond the expected placebo effect described for most therapeutic approaches in knee OA 43, 44.",
        "The past few years have witnessed increasing efforts in translating the benefits ascribed to cell therapy in a restricted—usually FCD—group of OA patients to the larger population with established nonfocal degenerative disease. Autologous cell‐based therapy with bone marrow (BM‐MSCs) and adipose tissue‐derived cells (ASCs) has been the aim of most of these series. Although MSC doses and follow‐up are variable between studies, all have used a single intra‐articular injection at baseline. Orozco et al. 19 demonstrated 70% pain relief with 40 × 106 autologous BM‐MSCs at 1 and 2 years of follow‐up, and subsequently, a 40% reduction of pain and 30% improvement in joint function in a more recent open label, single‐arm study of 15 patients 45. Jo et al. assessed ASCs in a proof of concept study at three different intra‐articular cell doses (10, 50, and 100 × 106), achieving a moderate decrease in WOMAC at 6 months only in the high‐dose group 20. However, in a phase I dose‐response trial by Pers et al. 21, preliminary evidence of clinical benefit at 6 months in terms of pain and disability was achieved only with the smallest cell dosing, of 2 × 106. The combination of MSC plus HA in a single injection has not added any clinical benefit so far 46.",
        "Even if all such MSC‐based trials report a good safety record, and some degree of improvement of cartilage quality or chondral defects 20, 21, 45, autologous cell therapy does encounter limitations. When derived from bone marrow, a 100‐fold decline of precursor cells has been noted from birth to the average age of typical OA patients 47. Furthermore, reduced chondrogenic activity of MSCs has been described in cultures originating from individuals with advanced OA 48. In this regard, the allogeneic source provided in the present trial (UC‐MSC) was shown to express superior clonogenicity, migration, and paracrine capacities in vitro, as well as less senescence when compared with BM‐MSCs 23. Indeed, our cell source has been extensively characterized and tested for alloreactivity 23, immunoregulatory and paracrine effects 24, and tumor development in immunodeficient laboratory animals 23, 49. This underscores that allogeneic cell sources can be batch tested for quality, purity, or potency 32, and made accessible for “off the shelf” administration, with no need for delays or prior invasive harvesting procedures. In spite of these advantages, clinical testing of allogeneic cell sources in OA has been limited. In cases with established disease, Vega et al. 22 have recently published a trial with 40 × 106 allogeneic BM‐MSCs showing 10% reduction of pain by WOMAC and mild improvement in cartilage morphology by MRI T2 mapping. Gupta et al. 50, in a study also with allogeneic BM‐MSCs, found no significant differences when comparing several intra‐articular cell doses (25, 50, 75, and 150 million) with placebo. In our protocol, we chose a dose of 20 × 106 UC‐MSCs, considered intermediate, given the large variability (3 to 150 × 106 cells) reported in trials. Another advantage of our trial was to test repeated MSC injections, totaling 40 × 106 cells and allowing the comparison of single versus double MSC doses, with respect to HA administration, because the available preclinical data suggested periodic application of MSCs could inhibit OA progression in rats 51. In contrast with preclinical observations by Joswig et al. 52, in our case, repeated intra‐articular injection of UC‐MSCs in patients did not trigger more frequent or severe AEs. Although allogeneic Adipose Tissue (AT)‐MSCs have been shown to induce a humoral immune response in patients 53, our prior experience with the UC‐MSC source from this trial describes no emergence of donor reactivity in response to treatment 23.",
        "Regarding structural outcomes, we detected no change at 6‐ or 12‐month follow‐up in our patients, possibly given the mild baseline involvement upon imaging. Initial WORMS scores were low (46.1 and 40.1 out of total 332 in MSC‐1 and ‐2 groups), and indexes for the cartilage component showed only limited disease according to our inclusion criteria. Nonetheless, longer‐term—2 year—data from our series could be informative because Vangsness et al. 18 have noted a preventive effect of MSC cell‐based therapy in OA development, with increased (3.1×) odds of disease progression at 2‐year follow‐up in controls. The main limitations of this phase I/II, randomized, controlled, triple‐blind trial are related to the small number of patients per group and the mild‐to‐moderate OA, which was associated with a low clinical and radiological involvement.",
        "In this phase I/II trial, a repeated UC‐MSC dose strategy led to a favorable safety profile and improved clinical result for the treatment of long‐term pain in knee OA patients.",

        "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder that displays a myriad of manifestations including hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone destruction (CRAB) (1, 2). MM is the second most common hematological malignancy with an estimated 32270 new cases and 12830 deaths in the United States in 2020 (3). Genetic abnormities, mostly translocation and hyper-diploidy, result in dysregulated cancer-immunity cycle that allows MM to escape immune surveillance with an uncontrolled cell proliferation (4, 5). The past two decades have significantly refashioned the therapeutic options of MM, such as the availability of proteasome inhibitors (PI), immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mABs), antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), and selective inhibitors nuclear export (SINE) (6). However, MM remains incurable for most patients, as persistent clonal evolution drives new mutations which confer MM high-risk signatures and resistance to standard care (7, 8). Therefore, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), characterized by the nature of clinicopathologic and molecular heterogeneity (9, 10), is frequently associated with poor prognosis (11).",
        "Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) has shown exceptional success in the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), B-cell chronic lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-CLL), and diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) (12, 13), thereby motivating its application in RRMM (14). T cells are firstly isolated from the patients’ or donors’ blood and genetically modified in the laboratory to encode an artificial receptor, enabling CAR T cells to identify targets better and precisely destroy cancer cells. CAR T-cell functions with two major roles: 1) tumor-associated antigen (TAA) binding; 2) MHC-independent T-cell activation. Emerging as a novel immunotherapy, CAR T-cell therapy consists of an extracellular antigen recognition domain (scFv, Fab, Nb, and NKG2D ligand), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain incorporating co-stimulation (CD28 or a 4-1BB) and signaling components (CD3zeta) (\nFigure 1\n) (15, 16). The interplay between tumor cell and CAR gives rise to an immunological synapse. This process could attack target cells through various pathways, such as the release of cytotoxic molecules, and the induction of apoptosis signal pathway, eventually leading to the activation of effector T cells and elimination of tumor cells (17).",
        "The structure of CAR-T cells. The antigen-binding domain is usually a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) but also has other structures; intracellular signaling domain include both co-stimulatory domain (CD28, 4-1BB) and activation domain (CD3zeta).

        "Despite great promises achieved by CAR-T therapy, the poor durability and severe toxicity are still huge challenges. The mechanisms driving resistance and relapse after MM CAR T-cell therapy remain uncharacterized. Consequently, this review aims to describe candidate tumor-associated neoantigens for MM, provide a summary of efficacy and safety data from clinical trials, introduce mechanisms of disease resistance/relapse to CAR-T, and explore future innovations capable of enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity, and provide potential directions to optimize manufacturing processes.",
        "The key to design a successful CAR is to select a surface antigen that presents at high concentration on MM cells, but absent in non-malignant hematopoietic lineages or other tissues (18–21). The most important avenue is to discover novel TAAs to improve CAR-T therapy. Several targetable antigens are currently being evaluated regarding their safety and efficacy in clinical trials (\nTables 1\n, \n2\n). Potential targetable antigens for MM are summarized in \nFigure 2\n, including BCMA, CD19, SLAMF7, GPRC5D, CD138, CD38, CD70, NKG2DL, Kappa light chain.",

        "B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, is the most commonly used surface antigen target for multiple myeloma CAR-T. BCMA plays a critical role in differentiating B-cell to plasma cell and maintaining the survival of plasma cell (34, 35). BCMA is preferentially expressed on plasma cells, though limited BCMA-positive cells can be identified in normal tissues, such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and the stomach (36, 37). A European study involving 70 MM patients identified that surface BCMA expression on plasma cells (normal or malignant) was significantly higher (P<0.001) than non-plasma cells (38). The high expression of surface BCMA is associated with MM in several preclinical models and humans, making it an attractive target for MM (39–41). However, BCMA could be expressed at high or low concentrations in MM cells (36, 42, 43). In a United Kingdom study, 28 evaluable MM patients all expressed BCMA, and levels differed from low to moderate (42). Similarly, a UK study reported that all 64 patients with MM expressed surface BCMA at varying levels by immunohistochemistry (43). Since there is a considerable variation in BCMA expression on MM cells, patients may respond differently to BCMA-targeted CAR-T therapy. As surface BCMA level may serve as an independent prognostic factor, cytogenetic assessments are of great importance (43). It is anticipated that patients with high levels of BCMA may gain more benefits from BCMA-targeted CAR-T therapy. Thereby, all findings support that BCMA may be a promising target for MM CAR-T therapy.",
        "The first BCMA-targeted MM CAR-T clinical trial was conducted by National Cancer Institute (NCT02215967) (44). A total of 24 patients with RRMM were enrolled. The notable findings of this study were the dose-dependence of efficacy and toxicity. The ORR was 20% among 10 patients receiving the lowest dose of 0.3-3.0 × 106 CAR-T cells/kg. However, of 16 patients treated with high-dose level, the ORR was 81% with 62.5% having very good partial response (VEGF) or better. Notably, the toxicity of low-dose CAR-T was generally modest and no patient with grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS). By contrast, grade 3-4 CRS and neurotoxicity (NTX) were 25% and 4% among patients treated with highest dose (9 × 106 CAR-T cells/kg). Further, a statistically significant relationship (P = 0.04) between plasma cell burden and severe CRS had been reported from patients with high-dose level of CAR-T cells. Many BCMA-targeted CAR-T clinical trials are ongoing or completed (\nTable 1\n). Additionally, combination therapies are evaluated as well, such as associating BCMA CARs with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (NCT04603827), immunomodulators (NCT03070327, NCT04287660), nonspecific immune inhibitors (NCT03943472), and gamma-secrete inhibitor (NCT03502577).",
        "Though a majority of MM CAR-T clinical trials target BCMA, but there are several studies focused on non-BCMA MM-associated neoantigens (\nTable 2\n).",
        "Human CD19 antigen belongs to type-I transmembrane glycoprotein of the IgG immunoglobulin superfamily. In normal tissues, CD19 is specifically expressed throughout the development of B-cell lineage except for hematopoietic stem cells and terminal plasma cells, whereas it is absent on other hematopoietic lineages. In B-cell malignancies, its expression is widely distributed in relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL) and relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R B-NHL) (45). Despite low expression of CD19 on MM cells, CD19 is expressed on the minor multiple myeloma stem cell (MMSC) subset that has been reported (46). MMSC is capable of self-renewal and drug-resistance. Thus, CD19 might be a potential target for MM. One clinical trial (NCT02135406) indicated that autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) followed by CD19-targeted CAR-T therapy (CTL019) infusion was safe and available in RRMM, leading to a longer PFS compared to patients with ASCT alone (47, 48).",
        "SLAMF7 belongs to the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family (SLAMF). SLAMF7 is firstly documented in natural killer cells (49). It is also expressed on T cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Over 95% of normal or malignant plasma cells of MM expressed SLAMF7 (50). Since SLAMF7 is also expressed in normal plasma cells, specific attacks on this target inevitably cause normal cell death. Thereby, SLAMF7 is an alternative but suboptimal choice for CAR-T cell therapy.",
        "The function of SLAMF7 is poorly understood, but previous evidence indicates its similar role as growth factor contributing to myeloma cell proliferation (51, 52). It has been reported that SLAMF7-CAR T cells attack myeloma and confer selective fratricide of SLAMF7-positive normal lymphocytes (53). A conceivable side effect is the depletion of SLAMF7+ lymphocytes, including a substantial proportion of T cells, B cells, and NK cells. It would be reasonable to engineer SLAMF7-CAR T cells with a safety switch to terminate fratricide of normal lymphocytes. Inducible caspase 9 or herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase might be preferable choices for safety switch (54, 55).",
        "Several anti-SLAMF7 CAR constricts are evaluated in clinical trials, mostly as monotherapy (NCT03710421, NCT04142619, NCT04541368, NCT03958656, NCT04499339), or as dual CARs targeting both BCMA and SLAMF7 (NCT04795882, NCT04156269).",
        "The G protein-coupled receptor, class C group 5 member D (GPRC5D), is expressed on 98% of the CD138+ cells by quantitative immunofluorescence (56). Also, this surface receptor is primarily expressed on hair follicles, but also in multiple myeloma cells. Therefore, GPRC5D-targeted CAR-T was constructed by Smith et al., which displayed potent anti-MM effects on MM cell lines and xenografted models (56). Anti-GPRC5D was deemed safe and effective as no alopecia or any skin-related disorders were detected in a preclinical study (57). A series of GPRC5D-CAR T trials are ongoing, such as NCT05219721, NCT04555551, NCT05016778. MCARH109, as the first-in-class GPRC5D-targeted CAR T-cell therapy for MM, has a manageable safety profile and high rates of clinical response (ORR: 83%). More importantly, all 6 patients who relapsed after BCMA-targeted CAR-T responded to MCARH109.",
        "As a major extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor, CD138 (syndecan-1) plays an important role in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, and cell proliferation (58, 59). CD138 is widely expressed on normal and malignant plasma cells (60), but also expressed on the surface of mature epithelial cells that might cause skin toxicity. A prior study found that a high concentration of CD138 might be poor prognostic factor for MM (61). A CD138-directed CAR-T (CART-138) has been built incorporating with a 4-1BB domain (62). Relevant CD138-targeted CAR trials include single-target (NCT01886976, NCT03672318, NCT03196414, NCT03778346) and multi-target CAR-T products (NCT03271632). Based on current data (NCT01886976), the ORR achieved 80% and no toxicity has been reported, manifesting a good efficacy and tolerability. However, CD138 shedding and skin toxicity are major barriers for wide application of CD138-targeted CAR-T.",
        "CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is known to mediate cell adhesion, signal transduction, and Ca2+ regulation (63). CD38 is highly expressed on the surface of MM cells, though its expression in normal hematopoietic cells also have been detected, such as T cells, precursors of B cells, NK cells, and myeloid precursors (63). Some monoclonal antibodies against CD38 have been approved by FDA to treat multiple myeloma, such as Daratumumab. The success of mAb targeting CD38 in the treatment of MM has encouraged the development of CD38-targeted CAR T cells. Light-chain exchange technology brings potential to avoid accident damage to CD38+ normal cells (64). A clinical trial (NCT0346491) investigated CD38-targeted CAR-T as a monotherapy for RRMM. In addition, dual CAR products are also tested in clinical trials, combing CD38 and BCMA (NCT03767751), CD38 and CD19 (NCT03125577).",
        "Aberrant expression of CD70 has been found in hematological malignancies and solid tumors (65). Because of its limited expression on normal cells, CD70 holds great promises for monoclonal antibody-based therapy. A preclinical study supported that CD70-targeted CAR T-cell therapy was safe and effective (66). Further, related publications manifested that CD70 targeting CAR-T cells caused robust anti-tumor activity in both human cancer cells and animal models (67, 68). It is worth noting that a clinical trial (NCT04662294) on CD70 is recruiting RRMM patients, although no data has been reported yet. Importantly, an obvious advantage is a low risk of fratricidal killing caused by CD70 antibody, mainly because of the transient expression of CD70 on immune cells (8).",
        "NKG2D, a cell surface receptor binding to several ligands, is predominantly expressed on immune cytotoxic cells, such as NK cell and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. NKG2D ligands, such as MIC-A, MIC-B, and UL-16, are upregulated in many solid tumors or hematologic malignancies but absent on healthy tissue. NKG2D binds to corresponding ligands to prompt the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of cytotoxic cells, leading to immune elimination of MM cells (69). Due to the presence of a natural costimulatory domain, DAP10, there is no need to add this specific domain to NKG2D CARs. But a potential challenge is the poor persistency of T cells. To resolve this problem, patients should be treated with high doses or multiple infusions without compromising the toxicity (70). Satisfactorily, higher doses have the same safety profile with low doses, with no reports of CRS or NTX so far. We have identified one NKG2D CAR study (NCT03018405) in MM with an enrollment of 12 patients, but efficacy profile has not been published.",
        "Although cell surface immunoglobulins are not expressed on all plasma cells, it is recognized that MM stem cells express surface immunoglobulins (71). Thereby, kappa light chain might be an ideal target for MM (71). Several monoclonal antibodies targeting kappa light chain have been developed and tested in clinical trials, such as MDX-1097 (72). But CAR-targeting kapa light chain is still a less explored field. In one trial conducted by Ramos et al., 4 of 7 RRMM patients responded to kappa-targeted CAR-T cell therapy, keeping disease stable for 2-17 months. In a phase-I trial of κ-CAR-T cells (NCT00881920), 16 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia or MM were enrolled. Notably, 4 of 7 patients with relapsed or refractory MM kept disease stable for 2-17 months (71).",
        "Despite the impressive ORR, over 50% of patients after BCMA-directed CAR-T would relapse or progress within 1-year (73). Another study showed a consistent preliminary trend that most MM patients who achieved MRD-negative to bb2121 have progressed in follow-up period (74). Thus, though CAR-T cells have the robust cytoreductive capacity to treat multiple myeloma, they cannot produce lasting immune surveillance. Currently, exact mechanism of disease resistance/relapse after MM CAR-T remains elusive, but there are several deductive mechanisms stated as following: 1) T cell-dependent resistance; 2) antigen-driven resistance (antigen escape, antigen shedding); 3) TME-related resistance. Some mechanisms are presented in \nFigure 3\n.",
        "Mechanism of resistance/relapse to BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell therapy. (A) BCMA escape and BCMA shedding are blocking the antigen recognition by CAR-T cells. Membrane BCMA can be cleaved by γ–secretase and released to the plasma as soluble BCMA (sBCMA). (B) Poor persistence of CAR-T cells is mainly caused by T cell exhaustion and T cell clearance. (C) The tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment is mainly led by inhibitory ligands (PD-1 and CTLA-4) and suppressive immune cells (MDSC and Treg cells). MM, multiple myeloma; MDCS, myeloid-derived suppressor cells; Treg cell, T regulatory cells.",
        "One study suggested that CAR-T cells were detectable up to 3 months after CAR-T injection and were gradually eliminated (73). At 12 months after infusion, only approximately 20% of patients had detectable engineered T cells (73). A lot of efforts have been made to figure out potential mechanisms leading to short persistence of CAR-T cells (73).",
        "CAR-T cells are immunogenicity, thereby they might be eliminated by adaptive immune response over time. Single-chain fragment variable (ScFv) is the most common antigen-binding counterpart in CAR-T constructs. Most of ScFvs in BCMA-directed CAR-T are derived from non-human species (73), which induce immunogenicity and thereby potentially limit the T-cell persistence. In legend-2 study (75), anti-ScFv antibodies were detected in 7 of 17 MM patients after receiving bi-epitope BCMA-targeting CAR-T (LCAR-B38M), and 6 of them had decreased CAR-T cells and experienced tumor recurrence. More specifically, camelid-derived ScFvs were used to assemble LCAR-B38M, specifically targeting two different epitopes of BCMA on MM cell surface. There are agreements that non-human ScFv can induce immunological reaction to produce anti-CAR antibodies, which eventually lead to T-cell clearance and constitute a higher risk of relapse after CAR-T. This observation also highlights the importance of manufacturing humanized ScFV.",
        "The differentiation stage of CAR-T cells affects their proliferation and survival, strongly correlating with their anti-tumor activity (76–78). The immunophenotype of T-cell used to manufacture CAR-T is considerably pivotal for T-cell persistence. Each subset of T cells possessed heterogeneity of proliferation and longevity (79). For example, naïve T-cells, stem memory T-cells, and central memory T-cells present the best proliferation capacity and delayed exhaustion or senescence (80). The enrichment of CD27+/CD45RO-/CD8+ T cells with memory-like features is correlated with long-term remission (81, 82). Also, a high percentage of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells with a naïve or stem memory characteristic are found to persist much longer and expand better in vivo, achieving superior outcomes after BCMA-targeted CAR-T treatment (23).",
        "This view keeps in line with a previous finding that longer persistence of CAR-T cells in vivo expansion has been associated with better clinical remission and survival for recipient patients (83–86). One study also indicated that persistent CAR-T cells detected in peripheral blood tend to generate superior clinical response even among patients with high-grade diseases (87). Therefore, naïve cells and memory cells are important for CAR-T cell manufacture, mainly because they display sustained proliferation and longer persistence in vivo.",
        "The quality of T cells also profoundly affects their life span in vivo. Notably, malignancy itself and chemotherapy-related myelosuppression could hamper T-cell fitness (88). When patients receive many lines of myeloma treatments, the composition of T cells would change over time. Furthermore, patients who underwent more lines of chemotherapies tended to have less early memory T cells in vivo (89).",
        "T-cell exhaustion is another potential culprit, mainly because of constitutive antigen-independent tonic signaling by CAR-T. A variety of factors are able to induce tonic signaling to form activating clusters, leading to off-target activation and T-cell exhaustion (90, 91). Optimizing the CAR to limit antigen-independent tonic signaling and increase antigen-dependent recognition could be beneficial for T-cell persistence. In an anti-GPRC5D model of CAR-T, an IgG4/IgG2-derived spacer with modifications has been raised by Smith and colleagues, which might delay T-cell exhaustion (57).",
        "Antigen escape and shedding are the most common causes of the failure of CAR-T cell strategy. First, downregulation of tumor antigen reduces the CAR-T cell targeting ability, weakening the tumor-killing effects. Second, increased antigen shedding into a soluble form could negatively affect the efficacy of CAR-T therapy.",
        "BCMA represents an important target. Theoretically, nearly all MM patients express BCMA irrespective of newly diagnosed or relapsed (38). It remains controversial about whether BCMA expression level is associated with the response rate to BCMA-directed CAR-T cells. However, loss of BCMA expression was suspected in post-treatment residual MM cells. Based on existing findings, there is a transient phenomenon that BCMA disappeared after initial response and subsequently remerged over MM progression (92). Though MM relapse is mainly caused by BCMA-positive clones, cases of recurrence led by BCMA-negative target cells have been noticed (22, 93). For example, a recent study pointed out that BCMA-negative was suspected in 3 of 71 patients at disease progression (94).",
        "BCMA shedding from plasma cells is mediated by γ-secretase, producing the soluble-BCMA (sBCMA) that serves as a circulatory biomarker. Previous literatures have demonstrated that sBCMA is associated with the tumor burden and the prognosis (41, 95). High levels of soluble-BCMA might competitively bind to ScFv and consequently interfere the precise recognition of MM cells by CAR-T cells (96). Inhibitors of γ-secretase avoid BCMA shedding from MM cells and reduce the interference of soluble BCMA. Intriguingly, based on preclinical data, soluble BCMA does not affect the function of novel BCMA-CAR T in vitro and in vivo (37). Up to date, there is no clear clinical evidence that the level of sBCMA could negatively affect the efficacy of BCMA-targeted CAR-T therapy.",
        "Likewise, high levels of soluble SLAMF7 are associated with a worse response to elotuzumab, along with a shorter survival (97). In addition, soluble CD38 could reduce the anti-MM response of daratumumab (98). However, as a seven-transmembrane protein, the likelihood of GPRC5D shedding into serum is low (57, 99). It is interesting to find that GPRC5D expression is independent from BCMA, therefore it might be an alternative target for relapsed MM patients after BCMA-directed therapy due to BCMA loss or shedding (57).",
        "The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in drug-resistance mechanism. CAR T cells need to overcome inhibitory signals and immunosuppressive cells existing in the TME. Immunosuppressive cells consist of T regulatory cells (Treg), B regulatory cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. These subsets may negatively affect the function of CAR-T cells (100–102). Besides, inaccessibility of MM cells by CAR-T cells forms another barrier. It is true MM cells generally reside in bone marrow microenvironment involving various cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM), which make CAR-T cells difficult to access MM (103). A recent study (104) about B-cell lymphoma reported a similar observation that many CD19-targted CAR-T cells did not successfully reach their target destination. Although mature CAR-T tracing method are still unmet needs, it is widely accepted that MM exploits immunosuppressive TME to block the efficacy of CAR-T cells and consequently lead to high risks of recurrence. PD1-PDL1 axis is another major cause of CAR T-cell dysfunction (105, 106). PD-1 expressed on activated T cells, is capable of binding with PD-L1 expressed by MM cells, eventually leading to exhausted state of T cells (107).",
        "For RRMM patients, poor persistence of T cells, antigen escape, and TME suppression restrict the durability of immune response and consequently limit the efficacy of CAR-T therapy in clinical settings. However, recently initiated studies have incorporated innovations to address above barriers (\nFigure 4\n, \nTable 3\n).",
        "Strategies to improve the efficacy of MM CAR-T cell therapy. (A) CAR-T cell products are designed to target multiple TAAs to overcome antigen escape. The monospecific CAR has a single scFv; the dual-target CAR construct includes two separate monospecific CARs on the surface of T cells; the tandem CAR has two antigen-binding domains that are linked tandemly on one CAR protein; the mixture of CAR-T cells describes the simultaneous transduction of different types of CAR-T cells in vivo. (B) The persistence of CAR-T cells can be enhanced by using less-differentiated T cell subsets. (C) CAR-T cells can be engineered to overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironment by using immune checkpoint inhibitors or direct gene knockout.",

        "Optimizing CAR-T design is a potential strategy to enhance CAR-T cell persistence. The utility of fully human recognition domains, rather than those derived from mouse antibodies, is an attempt to reduce immunogenicity which usually leads to clearance of CAR-T cells by patients’ immune system (22, 44, 75, 108, 109). Importantly, this strategy not only improves CAR-T cell persistence, but also simultaneously reduces cytokine storm. Besides, several studies demonstrated that the transmembrane region and co-stimulatory domain confer different properties of CAR-T cells that may influence efficacy and toxicity as well (110–125).",
        "Another promising approach is to use less-differentiated T cells subsets that have a good proliferative capacity, such as naïve T cells, stem cell memory T cells (TSCM), central memory T cells (TCM). According to preclinical studies, CAR-T cells with memory phenotype presented superior engraftment, proliferation, and longevity compared to general CAR-T components (126, 127). Further, those who are treated with a defined ratio (1:1) of CD4+/CD8+ CAR-T cells, were monitored with more potent T cell expansion and fewer toxicities in vivo (128, 129).",
        "In addition, lymphodepleting regimen may enhance the expansion of adoptively transferred T cells leading to superior persistence (130). First, lymphocytes depletion therapy before CAR-T could greatly reduce the risk of anti-CAR immune response. Second, a lymphodepleting environment is suitable for CAR-T cell expansion and persistence (80). It is known that IL-7 could assist CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell to preserve a stem memory phenotype in vivo (131), which is critical for T-cell expansion. All these data support the conclusion that more intense lymphodepletion may induce better CAR-T persistence and expansion.",
        "Increasing the density of BCMA expression is a critical area to counter antigen escape. The use of γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) is able to increase BCMA expression on MM cells and reduce sBCMA levels by inhibiting the cleavage of surface BCMA (132). Preclinical models (133) have demonstrated that the presence of GSI could lead to a threefold to fivefold increase of BCMA expression level in MM cell lines. Particularly, when the density of BCMA is relatively low on the target cells, the administration of GSI may enhance the capacity of identifying MM cells. Great advancements in the efficacy of BCMA-targeted CAR T cells in combination with GSI have been observed in mouse models (133). Currently, several GSIs are being tested in clinical trials, even including patients with solid tumors (134). Future studies might discover other approaches to upregulate BCMA expression.",
        "To address BCMA-negative clones, targeting two or more distinct antigens is underway. Due to the heterogeneity nature, targeting only one antigen at a time may not produce a long-lasting immunosurveillance in a large number of MM patients (135–137). More specifically, single target CAR-T only displays one single-chain variable fragment (ScFv) for antigen recognition, whereas dual-target CAR-T simultaneously contains co-stimulatory domain or tandem CAR molecules to overcome antigen escape and guarantee better identification. There are several strategies to achieve dual-target CAR-T products: 1) sequentially infusion of two CAR-T cells that respectively target different MM-associated antigen; 2) the same T cell displays two different CAR products; 3) One tandem CAR construct containing two antigen recognition moieties incorporated with one activation region (138). Available dual CAR products involved a combination of BCMA and CD19 (NCT04236011, NCT04162353), BCMA and SLAMF7 (NCT04662099, NCT04156269), BCMA and CD38 (NCT03767751).

        "CAR-T cells should preliminarily overcome direct T cell inhibitory signals presented in the TME. PD1-PDL1 is the best characterized pathway. Inhibition of the PD-1 signals could produce dramatic clinical benefits in a variety types of tumors (139). Recent studies have demonstrated that coadministration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) with CAR-T therapy brought increased efficacy in preclinical models (105). In addition to ICI, knockout of the PD-1 coding gene could be engineered by gene silencing techniques, such as short hairpin RNAs (140) and CRISPR-Cas9 (141). Also, armoured CAR T cells secreting cytokines or chemokines are able to alter the inflammatory microenvironment and support the functionality of CAR T cells (142). Further, the metabolic competition between tumor and immune cells in the TME may restrict nutrient availability and cause microenvironment acidosis, which could trigger T cell inhibitory pathways or otherwise hinder immune cell function (143). Intriguingly, the expression of the antioxidant enzyme catalase in CAR-T cells may overcome granulocyte-mediated oxidative stress in vitro (144). Modifying T cell metabolism is a promising area to boost efficacy, but further validation is needed in clinical application.",
        "Overall, treatment-related toxicity of MM CAR-T therapy involves two major categories: 1) general toxicity caused by T cell activation and following systemic cytokine storm; 2) specific toxicity caused by the interaction between CARs and TAAs expressed on non-tumor cells, which is also termed as ‘on-target, off-tumor’ toxicity.",
        "The rapid immune activation responsible for the success of CAR-T strategy also stimulates treatment-related toxicity. The clinical complications caused by different CAR-T in MM are similar to those led by CD19-targeted CAR-T in ALL and DLBCL (84, 145, 146), including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity (NTX), and hematologic cytopenia, which might limit the wide application of CAR-T cell therapy in MM.",
        "The most frequent toxicity is cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a constellation of symptoms involving fever, myalgia, hypoxia and hypertension, resulting from increased inflammatory cytokines like IL-6. IL-6 receptor antagonism via Tocilizumab and short-course steroids could be used for CRS management (147). Besides, CAR-T cell-associated HLH/MAS is a more severe systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome. CAR-T cell-induced HLH/MAS may be resistant to IL-6 receptor inhibitors, of which condition chemotherapy would be required (145).",
        "Neurotoxicity (NTX), is the second major adverse effect, mainly because of the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and increased cerebrospinal fluid cytokine levels (148). NTX frequently occurs with or following CRS, presenting encephalopathy, delirium, aphasia, seizures, and life-threatening cerebral oedema (149). The consensus grading scheme proposed by ASBMT was applied extensively (149). Notably, the grade 3-4 CRS and NTX could be effectively managed by tocilizumab and supportive care. Also, management of NTX comprises of corticosteroids and IL-6 pathway antagonisms (145). A special form of NTX is referred to immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), as transient encephalopathy, which is attributed to off-target cytokine production, as well as immune response of central nervous system (CNS). A mounting evidence suggests that ICANS could be characterized by atypical features and prolonged timeframes (150). And its management coincides with CRS interventions, such as cytokine inhibitors and corticosteroids. However, current understanding of ICANS is still limited. The mechanisms for ICANS after BCMA-targeted therapy need further elucidation (151).",
        "Hematologic cytopenia is commonly reported following BCMA CAR-T cell therapy, manifesting as leukopenia, lymphopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, which could increase the risks of infection, bleeding, fever, and bruising (146, 152–154). After infusion, CAR-T cells not only activate tumor-specific T-cell, but also induce non-specific T or B clones that target hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), neutrophils, platelets, and erythroid cells (155). Besides, the release of cytokines could drive differentiation but arrest maturation of HSC (156). Therefore, the IL-6 blockade may control hematologic cytopenia as well. The management of cytopenia also includes transfusion of blood cells and growth factors of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (157, 158).",
        "To counter systemic cytokine toxicity, CAR-T cells must reach a threshold level for activation but not exceed the level that would result in a series of cytokine secretion. Thus, therapeutic window for each CAR should be carefully considered. Researchers are currently engineering several innovations to control CAR expression or activity (\nFigure 5\n).",
        "Strategies to overcome systemic cytokine toxicity. To counter systemic cytokine storm, several approaches are engineered to adjust CAR expression or activity. (A) Suicide gene system enables the elimination of CAR-T cells by following strategies: a) the activation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); b) the induction of apoptosis pathway. (B) The ‘ON/OFF switches’ of CAR-T cells could be regulated by small molecular agents. scFv, single chain fragment variable; MAC, membrane attack complex; iCasp9, inducible caspase 9.",
        "Firstly, 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain is associated with a much slower onset of T cell activation, increased T cell durability, and a lower risk of cytokine-related toxicity compared to CD28 domain. Therefore, inclusion of 4-1BB co-stimulatory domains might be less toxic in patients with heavy tumor burden. But CD28 is necessary to achieve the required threshold for T cell activation, especially for MM with a relatively low density of antigen or a low-affinity antigen-binding domain. Overall, the choice of co-stimulatory domain is critical to balance the efficacy and safety in CAR-T cell therapy.",
        "Secondly, engineering ‘suicide genes’ into the CAR construct could induce apoptosis to eliminate CAR-T cells when treatment-related toxicity occurs. Co-expression of suicide receptors on MM CAR-T cells, such as CD20 and EGFR, could be attacked by rituximab (159–161) and cetuximab (162), respectively. Therefore, these FDA-approved antibodies provide a mean to deactivate CAR-T cells. Another strategy is to incorporate apoptosis-triggering fusion protein into CAR-T cells. iCasp9 is a well-characterized example, which can be triggered by dimerizing agents and subsequently drive rapid T cell depletion (163).",
        "Thirdly, administration of small-molecular agents could control ‘on or off switch’ on CAR-T cells. Dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for CML and ALL. This agent enables the inhibition of LCK or intracellular signaling cascade, followed by destroying the downstream signal of activated CD3zeta. It has been demonstrated that dasatinib rapidly and reversibly hinder CAR-T cell activation, which provides a well-tolerated pharmacological toxicity switch without eradication of T cells (164). Alternatively, switch-off CARs (SMASh-CARs) provide another strategy to dynamically regulate T cell functionality via embedding a protease target, a protease, and a degron moiety (165). In the ‘OFF’ state, the degron moiety promotes the degradation of CAR-protease-degron complex. Protease inhibitors may function as the similar role to retain the degron structure. In the ‘On’ state, the protease target site is cleavage by protease leading to the removal of the degron from CAR protein, and consequently the CAR is expressed on the surface of T cells.",
        "In addition, a more direct antagonism way is knockout of cytokine genes or expression of cytokine antagonists, both of which might provide opportunities to avert systemic toxicities. For example, the macrophage-activating and monocyte-activating cytokine GM-CSF can be antagonized by mutational inactivation and antibody lenzilumab, both of which can increase CAR T cell persistence while decreasing the risk of CRS.",
        "Typically, CAR T cells are designed to target tumor-associated antigens (TAA). However, some TAAs are also expressed on the normal cells, leading to mistaken recognition and attack by CAR T cells. BCMA is a prominent TAA for CAR-T cell therapy in MM. However, the public transcriptomic datasets confirmed BCMA RNA expression in the caudate of normal human brains (166), indicating an on-target effect of anti-BCMA CAR-T therapy. Given the reports of phase-II cilta-cel study, 12 of 97 patients were reported with non-ICANS neurotoxicity. 5 of 97 (5.2%) patients suffered from a cluster of movement and neurocognitive symptoms (3 with ≥ Grade 3 parkinsonism) (167). Among them, one patient developed a progressive movement disorder with symptoms of parkinsonism around three months after BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell infusion. By analyzing this case, one study demonstrated that BCMA expression on neurons and astrocytes in the basal ganglia (166). Therefore, BCMA-targeted CAR-T cells may hold the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier and induce a progressive neurocognitive or movement disorder by targeting the basal ganglia. Close monitoring of neurotoxicity is necessary in patients with BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell therapies.",
        "Engineering strategies aims to overcome on-target, off-tumor toxicity mediated by CAR-T cell therapy (\nFigure 6\n). The first strategy is to enhance the specificity of antigen recognition. Targeting multiple TAA is a promising approach. Specifically, CAR protein could be disassembled into two separate receptors, one with CD3zeta domain and another with a co-stimulatory domain. Both receptors need to recognize different TAAs for CAR T cells activation. Preclinical models have observed the promises in such a strategy (168–170). Alternatively, the inhibitory CAR (iCAR) contains a special inhibitory region that is generally derived from immune checkpoint proteins, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4. The inhibitory signal could recognize an antigen expressed on healthy tissues but absent on tumor cells (171). Moreover, engineering chimeric co-stimulatory receptor enables T cells to recognize antigens that are enriched on tumor cells. The second strategy is to utilize logic gating or conditional system to control CAR-T cell activation, such as the phospho-antigens that could be identified by T cell receptor. For example, HIF-1α degradation pathway is exploited to restrict CAR expression to CAR-T cells located in hypoxia TME, thereby avoiding adverse effects on healthy tissues which are normally non-hypoxic (172).",
        "Strategies to overcome on-target, off-tumor toxicity. The expression of tumor-associated antigens on healthy tissues can lead to ‘on-target, off-tumor’ toxicity. (A) The specificity of CAR T cells is enhanced by targeting multiple TAAs. The activation domain and co-stimulatory domain should respectively bind to different antigens on MM cells for CAR T cell activation. (B) Alternative strategy is to use the inhibitory CAR against a specific non-tumor antigen, requiring the absence of this antigen on MM cells.",

        "Currently, all FDA-approved CAR-T constructs are manufactured within autologous T cells isolated from the patients’ blood. However, this individualized production process is somewhat costly and time-consuming, limiting the number of MM patients who can benefit from CAR-T therapy. First, the manufacture time of autological CAR-T cells is lengthy. Many patients with advanced stage of MM may be unable to benefit from this therapy (84, 186). Second, the production failure may be attributable to the insufficient T cells obtained from MM patients, as patients who previously received chemotherapy tend to undergo bone marrow suppression and lymphodepletion (88, 187). Third, the heterogeneity of apheresis CAR product is another underlying cause of preparation failure. There is a phenomenon that dysfunctional T subsets could result in inferior CAR-T products, consequently leading to poor efficacy and response rates (81, 188–191).",
        "Allogeneic donor T cells provides an alternative to autological CAR-T cell therapy, which might potentially solve the manufacturing issues of inadequate T-cell number and suboptimal T-cell fitness for CAR-T production. CAR-T cells could be derived from HLA-matched allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell donors. Nevertheless, allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy has been associated with graft-versus-host (GVHD) and graft rejection. The engrafted allogeneic donor cells could launch an attack on recipient cells (192), whereas the host immune cells are able to eliminate allogeneic CAR-T cells. Recently, genetic modifications are explored to cope with T cell alloreactivity, such as TCR disruption and safety switch insertions (176). Genome-editing technologies include ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR-Cas 9, all of which are used to generate universal CAR-T cells (193). Ongoing clinical trials provide novel armamentarium for MM immunotherapy.",

ALLO-715 is a genetically modified anti-BCMA CAR-T product which employed TALEN technology to disrupt the TCR constant gene and CD52 gene to prevent GVHD and allow the use of anti-CD52 based lymphodepletion (194). At the time of data cut-off, 47 patients were enrolled; 42 patients received ALLO-715 infusion. Efficacy outcomes presented 61.5% ORR among patients with high doses. Safety prolife showed CRS occurred in 52.4% and there was no grade 4-5 CRS. Overall, the UNIVERSAL trial demonstrates the proof for allogeneic CAR-T therapy for MM, which might bring meaningful efficacy and tolerable toxicity. But this trial continues to enroll more patients and follow-up data will be updated in the future (176).",
        "In the process of commercial manufacture, patients need to wait for around 3-4 weeks until CAR-T infusion, in whom disease might progress while waiting for CAR production. The first-in-human dual BCMA and CD19 targeted CAR was manufactured by a novel platform (FAST CAR platform) that significantly reduced the production time to only 24-36 hours (195). Latest results of this trial (NCT04236011) showed a high response with 100% (DL-1: 1×105/kg), 80% (DL-1: 2×105/kg), and 93.8% (DL-1: 3×105/kg) ORR, respectively. Also, 23 out of 28 patients (82.1%) suffered from grade 1-2 CRS and 2 patients (7.1%) with grade 3. The data presented promising efficacy and favorable safety of the BCMA-CD19 dual fast CAR-T for RRMM patients (182). This clinical trial is still ongoing and recruiting more patients.",
        "At ASH 2021, a rapid manufacturing process that could both preserve the stemness of T cells to ensure longer durability and provide timely access for patients with aggressive disease, has been presented (28). Researchers developed a superior anti-BCMA CAR-T construct (PHE885) carrying a fully human anti-BCMA ScFv fused to 4-1BB/CD3zeta signaling domains and an innovative T-Charge manufacturing platform, which enables rapid and reliable patient access. More specifically, this novel manufacturing platform allows PHE885 to preserve a higher percentage of naïve/TSCM cells, leading to effectively engraft, expand, and reject tumors. Based on this principle, a phase-I trial (NCT04318327) has been initiated and early data of this study will be presented in the future.",
        "CAR-T cells start to disappear at first 3-6 months after infusion, subsequently leading to the loss of disease control. An innovation is to enrich early memory T cells by modification of manufacturing process. JCARH125 is a well elaborated example. Its production is optimized to harvest early memory T-cell and increase T-cell fitness. Relevant clinical trial (EVOLVE) data have been previously presented in ASH 2018. According to the latest reporting at ASCO 2020 (174), a total of 44 patients who received higher doses (300 × 106, 450 × 106, 600 × 106) respectively achieved the ORR of 95%, 94%, and 71%. A promising finding is that functional CAR-T cells could be detected in 69% of cases at 6 months. P-BCMA-101 is an autologous BCMA-targeted CAR construct that consisted of a large number of stem cell memory cells. P-BCMA-101 was manufactured by a novel virus-free transposon “piggy-Bac” technology that preferentially transfect early memory T cells (196), thereby increasing efficacy while minimizing toxicity (173). A phase I-II study of P-BCMA-101 (NCT03288493) is being tested in RRMM patients and early data were reported in ASH 2018 (197).
